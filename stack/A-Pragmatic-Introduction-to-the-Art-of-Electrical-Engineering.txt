How Did We Get Here?
A Book is Born
For the Fall of 1996, I was given the assignment of teaching the required introduc-
tory EE course for other engineering majors. Usually, visiting faculty were rele-
gated to this unseemly task, but we were shorthanded so some of us on the tenure 
track would have to pay our dues. My fellow faculty warned me to expect terrible 
student evaluations, since most of the students were only taking the course because 
it was required, and really didn’t want to be there. It seemed pretty grim.
Knowing that I would soon be leaving, I decided to throw caution to the wind, and 
teach a radically different kind of introductory course - one based totally on 
projects, yet with a sound theoretical underpinning. I couldn’t ﬁnd an appropriate 
text, and in any case, I knew my students couldn’t afford both a text and the serious 
lab kits I had in mind. So I resolved to write this book “on-the-ﬂy” over the course 
of the semester. Each weekend, I would build, write and draw like crazy, hand it to 
my editor in chief, my wife Cathy, you would rather bluntly tell me how bad it was. 
Then I would start again, often from scratch, and churn out something that she 
could reasonably ﬁx up. The result is this text.

Obviously, this book only exists due to the wonderful support of my wife, Cathy, 
who not only tolerated losing many weekends to this effort, but also provided 
detailed technical suggestions, did signiﬁcant rewrites, and cleaned up most of the 
more outrageous runs on sentences, like this one.
A great deal of credit goes to my fabulous teaching staff, Pat Malloy and Bill 
Glenn, who worked far above and beyond the call of duty. They put in absolutely 
insane hours in the lab, helping all of our students to successfully complete all of 
the projects. They ran review sessions, prepared many post-lab handouts (“here’s 
what you learned”) and generally made the course a smashing success. The also 
made invaluable suggestions, many of which are incorporated in this version of the 
text.
Finally, I’d like to thank Ken Gracey of Parallax, who has been pushing me to make 
this book more widely available. Hopefully, somebody out there will ﬁnd this use-

Cold Sandwiches, again?
On those days when I was sick enough to stay home from school, my Mom would 
let me watch mid-day TV. One of the most common commercials of those time 
slots began with the depressed husband complaining, “Cold sandwiches, again?” 
The wife suggests technical training in electronics. In no time at all, the happy cou-
ple is gorging on roast something or other. This could be you.
Well, maybe an understanding of electronics won’t change your life quite this dra-
matically, but it certainly couldn’t hurt. Look around you. There are electronic gad-
gets everywhere. Wouldn’t you like to know how they function? After just one 
semester of study with this text, you’ll have - I guess I have to be honest here - 
absolutely no clue how any of it works.
The problem is that electronic stuff has gotten much too complex. There are now 
toothbrushes with more complex circuitry than was in ENIAC, the ﬁrst computer! 
You can’t possibly understand it all in one semester.
This presents an interesting dilemma for those of us trying to teach an introduction 
to electrical engineering, especially when it is a terminal course. (No, we don’t 
mean that it will kill you - we mean that it might be the only EE course you ever 
take.) What should we teach?

Electrical Engineering for Fun and Proﬁt

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
In most introductory EE classes, the emphasis is on abstract fundamental princi-
ples. “Here’s a circuit with 26 resistors, 4 voltage sources, and 2 current sources - 
solve for everything.” Questions like these might build your analytical skills, but 
quickly deplete your stock of No-Doze. Why in the world would you ever want to 
solve a problem like that?
(There is actually a reason. If you continue in electrical engineering, and enter the 
particular subdiscipline of analog circuit design, you can then spend hours checking 
the result your circuit simulator produced in 0.2 seconds. This is very handy.)
This book takes a totally different approach. Instead of dealing in the abstract with 
an occasional fabricated “real world” example, we will present real problems, and 
show you what you need in order to solve them. Fundamentally, we know that 
given the limited time, there is no way we can explain everything. But we can teach 
you enough to make you dangerous. (Dangerous, that is, to professional electrical 
engineering consultants that will typically charge you a fortune for things you can 
whip up in your basement in 20 minutes.) After a semester, you should be able to 
create electronic things that will amaze your friends and family. However, you will 
still have no clue how that electronic toothbrush really works.
Electrical Engineering as Programming and 
Interfacing
Go ﬁnd your favorite electronic gadget. We’ll wait.
Okay, open it up, and what you will undoubtedly see are a bunch of small black 
boxes attached to a board. Most of the black plastic things are integrated circuits. 
Odds are pretty good that the biggest one is some sort of microprocessor or micro-
controller - basically, a computer on a chip. The rest is probably stuff the micro 
needs to operate, or to talk to the outside world.
The curious thing is that the people who “design” these electronic things are mostly 
buying parts out of a catalog, and hooking them together, often just as diagrammed 
on some datasheet. So, as Walter Mondale (warning - archaic reference for the 
Internet generation!) might have said, “Where’s the beef?” - what did these people 
really design?
Part of the “design” was in choosing the right parts, but lots of companies use very 
similar, if not identical parts. What often distinguishes an electronic product is not

its hardware, but its software! Remember the micro, the computer inside? It is a 
great deal easier and cheaper to write software than to design and build hardware. 
So the intellectual capital largely goes into the software.
How did we get to this state of affairs? Call it the digital revolution, if you like. 
Micros got irresistibly cheap. At the time of this writing, 8-bit micorcontrollers are 
just starting to fall below $0.50/unit. So rather than designing some tricky circuit to 
perform some control function, you buy some mass produced micro, interface it to 
your stuff, and simply program it to do whatever you want. This accurately 
describes a vast array of modern electronic products. Not everything, but a lot of 
stuff.
Programming the little computers, while sometimes painful, is fairly straight for-
ward. Hopefully, if you are reading this book, you have some signiﬁcant program-
ming experience. So this part is easy. The problem is, how do you hook up these 
little computers to do useful stuff? How do you interface the micros? This is the 
question we will really be addressing in this text.
(Some of you might be wondering about those people who design the chips - they 
must really be doing some serious EE. Ironically, these chips have gotten so com-
plex that they are physically laid out by electronic design automation software. 
How do you tell the software what you want the chip to do? You write programs in 
a hardware description language. So even here, the problem is largely reduced to 
programming.)
The Basic Stamp 2
This is a class in electrical engineering, not programming. But it is very difﬁcult to 
talk about building modern circuits without doing some programming. And, as we 
implied earlier, programming a micro can be tedious.
Enter Parallax, Inc. They make a series of tiny microcontrollers with built in BASIC 
interpreters. These micros are relatively expensive, slow, and kind of kludgy (a 
favorite term of your author), but remarkably powerful and simple to use. Called 
BASIC Stamps, they are literally postage stamp size.
In this text, we will presume that you have access to a BASIC Stamp 2 and the 
accompanying documentation. We will use the Stamp as our vehicle to explore 
electrical engineering, and the problems of interfacing a micro to the real world.

About This Book
Each of the following chapters will begin with a problem - How do you build a sys-
tem to do such and such. This will be followed by a discussion of the background 
material you will need to interface the BASIC Stamp so as to solve the problem. 
The hope is that this approach will not only yield a solid understanding of electrical 
engineering fundamentals, but will also promote actual skill at designing and build-
ing functional electronic systems.

CHAPTER 1
Getting Started with the 
BASIC Stamp 2
The Problem
Okay. You’ve got a BASIC Stamp 2. Make it do something.
I guess we can be more speciﬁc, but that is the general idea. Go to the lab, hook up 
your Stamp, and run the two example programs from this chapter. In addition, you 
should write a program that counts seconds in the debug window.
What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are a few things you need to know:
• What is a BASIC Stamp 2?
• How do I wire it up?
• How do I get to the software?
• A ﬁrst example program
• A second example program

Getting Started with the BASIC Stamp 2

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
 What is a BASIC Stamp 2?
A BASIC Stamp 2 is actually a PIC microcontroller with a BASIC interpreter in 
ROM. It also includes EEPROM for program storage, a voltage regulator, and a 
handful of other components to make it useful for embedded control applications.
Let’s try that again in English.
A BASIC Stamp 2 is a small computer which you can easily program with very 
simple commands. Programs can be stored or erased with out special hardware, and 
the programs remain in memory even after you remove the battery. Although most 
of the circuitry on the Stamp actually runs off of 5 Volts, there is a device which 
allows you to power it from a 9 Volt battery, automatically converting this into the 
required 5 Volt supply. In addition, there’s lots of other stuff on the Stamp to make 
it useful for controlling everything from airplane servos to your bedroom lights, 
however, you can’t run Windows98 on it.
There’s a lot one could say about the Stamp. Why, you could even write a book 
about it. And as luck would have it, you should each have a copy of just such a book 
- the BASIC Stamp 2 manual.
Rather than trying to summarize the manual here, you really should read it for your-
self. On a ﬁrst reading, try to make it through the ﬁrst section (about 25 small 
pages), and just skim through the commands section which follows. The manual 
ends with some applications information, which you can safely skip over for now.
(Note: The entire manual is available on-line from the Parallax web site at: http://
www.parallaxinc.com.)
How Do I Wire it Up?
To do anything with the Stamp, you must connect it to the serial port of an appro-
priate computer, and also connect power. Parallax sells a nice little carrier board to 
help you do this, but they are expensive, and difﬁcult to use when adding additional 
circuitry. Instead, we will put the Stamp into a solderless breadboard (which we’ll 
explain momentarily), and use a custom made serial cable and a 9V battery clip.
The manual shows a picture of the Basic Stamp 2 and details all the connections. 
This ﬁgure also appears below. You might want to make a photocopy of this and

How Do I Wire it Up?
paste it someplace handy because you will need to refer to it quite frequently. Look-
ing at the Stamp, pin 1 is right next to where it says “Parallax.”
A solderless breadboard (sometimes referred to as a Proto-Board, the brand name 
of a particular manufacturer) allows you to make connections by simply pushing 
components and wires into little holes which connect in a well organized pattern. A 
diagram of the connections in a typical breadboard is shown below.
The long connected runs are generally used for power and ground connections 
since they must be routed so many places. A note of caution here: on some boards, 
these longer runs, often called buses, are broken into unconnected segments in a 
less than obvious manner. Make certain that you really understand the connection 
pattern for your particular board before you begin wiring.
The Stamp is a 24 pin DIP, or Dual In-Line Package. That means it has two rows of 
pins. The breadboard is designed so that DIPs can straddle across to two sets of hor-
izontal rails, allowing you to make easy connections to any pin independently. This 
is done by cutting little pieces of wire, stripping the ends, and inserting them into 
the proper holes.
Since we’re on the topic of breadboards, this is an appropriate time to say some-
thing about wiring style. Every wire should be cut to the appropriate length, no less 
and no more, and neatly placed on the board. Personally, I like to see wires running 
only horizontally and vertically - no angles. Careful wiring will make your circuit

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
inﬁnitely easier to debug, should there be a problem. If your circuit looks like a 
bird’s nest, you have almost no chance of ﬁnding mistakes.
Once you become experienced with the basic tools of the trade (wire cutters, strip-
pers and needle nose pliers), there is a great little trick for making up correct length 
wires very rapidly. What you really want is a piece of insulation that runs from one 
connection point to the other, with some excess wire sticking out both ends. So 
instead of cutting a length of insulated wire and then stripping the ends, strip off a 
long piece to give some working room, and then strip a piece of insulation the cor-
rect length and slide it to about 1/2 cm from the end of the wire. Then you just cut 
the wire so as to leave a 1/2 cm of wire sticking out the other end. and you’re done. 
To make more wires, you just keep stripping the right length, sliding it to almost the 
end, cutting, and inserting the result in the right place. For very short wires (e.g. 
adjacent pins), don’t even bother with the insulation - just use the bare wire.
To connect up your Stamp, carefully insert it into the breadboard making certain 
not to bend any of the pins. Although the Stamp will run nicely from a 9V battery, 
ﬂipping the battery connections, for even a moment, will destroy the Stamp. (I call 
that a cancelled Stamp.) Unfortunately, it is far too easy to do this with a 9V battery 
when fumbling to get the clip on the right way. It is highly recommended that you 
place a diode (a kind of electronic one-way valve) in series with the battery to pre-
vent a reverse connection from destroying your Stamp. We’ll learn all about diodes 
in the coming chapters, but for now, locate a 1N4007 diode, and connect the end 
with the band to the Stamp pin 24 (PWR) and the other end to the red wire (i.e. the 
positive side) of a 9V battery clip. The black wire (i.e. the negative side) of the bat-
tery clip should go to pin 23 (GND).
Next, you need to connect the serial cable. One end of the cable gets connected to a 
PC serial port. The other end should have 4 connections that go to pins 1 - 4 (TX, 
RX, ATN and GND respectively) on the Stamp in the correct order. Because cables 
vary, you should refer to the appendix, Making a Stamp Serial Cable.
This completes the wiring.

How Do I Get to the Software?
How Do I Get to the Software?
The PC needs special software to let you program and communicate with the 
Stamp. Copies of this software are available from the Parallax web site: http://
www.parallaxinc.com. Check out the Stamp documentation for a full description of 
what you need (probably stamp2.exe), and how to use it.
A First Example Program
Now that everything is wired up, we’re ready to start on our ﬁrst program. Gener-
ally, we will have all sorts of goodies wired up for the Stamp to control. But since 
we want to try out the connections we have so far, we will content ourselves with 
just sending some text back to the computer to see that things are working.
So, without further ado, here’s the ﬁrst program - Hello, Good-bye World!
loop:
debug cls
debug “Hello, World!”
pause 1000
debug cls
debug “Good-bye, World!”
pause 1000
goto loop
First, connect the battery. Then follow the instructions in the manual for entering 
the program. When you have completed this, type Alt-R (which means to type the R 
key while holding down the key labeled Alt). You should brieﬂy see a message say-
ing that the program is downloading, and then the debug screen should appear alter-
nately ﬂashing the two messages. If you get an error message about not being able 
to locate the hardware, you have probably miswired something, put the diode in 
backwards, or forgotten to connect the battery.
Examine this program carefully. “loop” is a label, and could have been called any-
thing. “debug”, “pause” and “goto” are all commands that you should look up in 
your manual. Make sure you understand what is going on here. (“debug” is the 
moral equivalent of the “print” statement you may have seen in other versions of 
BASIC, and is very useful for - surprise - debugging!)

Getting Started with the BASIC Stamp 2
6
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
If you wish to modify your program, hit a key other than space to remove the debug 
window, modify your code, and then type Alt-R again. This will replace the old pro-
gram with the new one. It really is that simple.
A Second Example Program
Our ﬁrst program was pretty self explanatory. Next, we are going to try something 
with a little bit more interesting syntax. The goal of this next program is to add two 
numbers together, and then display the result. Here’s the code:
‘Our second example program
‘Paul H. Dietz
‘8/28/96
‘------------------------------------------------------
‘This program adds two numbers together, and displays
‘the result in the debug window.
‘------------------------------------------------------
‘First, define the variables
num1
var
byte
‘add this number
num2
var
byte
‘to this number
result var
byte
‘to get this number
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
‘add the numbers
result = num1 + num2
‘show the result
debug dec num1, “ + “, dec num2, “ = “, dec result
stop
As in most programming languages, you need to deﬁne your variables in advance 
of using them. Here we have declared our numbers to all be bytes. Thus, they can 
range from 0 to 255. (On a Stamp, all numbers are integers - no fractions.) Next, we 
assigned values to these variables. Since we never change them, we could have used 
constants instead. After adding them, we display the result using some of the nice 

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
7
A Second Example Program
formatting features of the debug statement. Finally, we tell the processor to stop, 
which means to sit there and do nothing.
After you feel you understand what is going on here, it’s time to write the timer pro-
gram. It’s just a simple combination of some of the things we demonstrated in these 
two programs. If you ﬁnd yourself with extra time, you might want to try out some 
of the other functions. Play around with the Stamp, and enjoy!

CHAPTER 2
Lights and Switches
The Problem
So far, we needed a computer to see the results of our Stamp programs. Wouldn’t it 
be nice to see the Stamp do something by itself?
Your task for this chapter is to interface the Stamp to switches and lights. Speciﬁ-
cally, you should build a system which indicates on an seven segment LED display 
the number of times a button has been pressed.
What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are a few things you need to know:
• What is voltage?
• What is current?
• What is an LED and why do I need a resistor?
• How do I interface a switch?
• What is a seven segment display?

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
9
What is Voltage?
 What is Voltage?
As you may have noticed in the Stamp documentation, there are commands to set a 
pin to an output or an input, and when an output, to set it high or low. Output and 
input are pretty intuitive, but what actually goes high or low?
The short answer is that setting a pin high means that it is driven to 5 volts, and 
when it is low, it is driven to 0 volts. But what does that mean? What is a volt? To 
answer that question, we’ll have to delve into a little science.
Voltage is related to potential energy. From physics, you might recall potential 
energy as that stuff you got when you lifted something off the ground. Let go of that 
something, and it falls back to the ground, releasing that potential energy you stored 
up in lifting it in the ﬁrst place.
Instead of lifting a weight off the ground, imagine you had a positive charge and a 
negative charge. (What’s charge? We have no idea. You can only go so deep...) As 
opposite charges, they attract each other. If they are initially together, and you start 
to pull them apart, your effort is being stored as potential energy. If you let go, the 
charges jump back together, just like the weight crashing to the ﬂoor.
To calculate the potential energy of the weight, you would measure the distance it 
was raised, and plug into the equation E = mgh. For the charges, the quantity analo-
gous to height is voltage. In physicist’s terms, voltage is a potential. To calculate the 
potential energy, you must multiply the voltage by the amount of charge raised to 
this potential. In other words, voltage is a measure of potential energy per unit 
charge. Think of voltage as the electronic “height” of some charge.
Let’s go back to the weight for a moment. If you lift it off the ground, your work 
has given it some amount of potential energy. While you are holding it up in the air, 
an annoying friend, we’ll call him Paul, shoves a table under your hand. If you were 
to let go of the weight, it would only fall a little bit down before it hit Paul’s table. 
That doesn’t release much energy. So the question Paul asks you is, if your weight 
will release less energy when you drop it, doesn’t it now have less potential energy? 
And if it does, where did this energy go? Did it just disappear?
Rather than risk arrest from the Thermodynamic Police, you quickly point out that 
potential energy is always measured between two points. Your weight still has the 
same potential energy relative to the ﬂoor. It is meaningless to talk about potential 
energy without respect to some resting position.

Lights and Switches
10
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
The same is true of voltage - it is always measured between two points. But like the 
original weight example, sometimes the reference point is not speciﬁcally men-
tioned, but is nevertheless presumed to be the ground. In fact, electrical engineers 
use this exact same word, ground, to refer to a reference level to which all voltages 
are compared. So when we say that the Stamp has 0 volts or 5 volts on a pin, that is 
measured with respect to ground. Which, in the case of the BASIC Stamp 2, hap-
pens to be on pin 23, and is labeled “GND”. In more generic terms, voltage is an 
across variable - it is always measured across two points.
What is Current?
Voltages only tell part of the story. Circuits provide paths for those charges that 
have been raised to some potential to ﬂow back down to ground. The ﬂow of charge 
is called current. It is measured in Amperes, or amps for short, and is literally the 
number of Coulombs of charge that pass a point per second. (A Coulomb is about 6

Whereas voltage was an across variable, current is a through variable. You measure 
voltage across a lightbulb by putting the leads of a voltmeter on each side of the 
bulb. To measure current, you break the circuit, and insert the current meter (some-
times called an Ammeter) into the circuit so that all of the current must ﬂow 
through it. The two conﬁgurations are shown below.
Note that the current meter is labeled “I”. Electrical engineers use the letter “v” 
when referring to voltages, and “i” when referring to currents. Why “i” for current?

What is Current?
If you’re curious, go to the library, and read up on the early history of electrical 
engineering. (Which is my way of saying that I really don’t know why...)
You should also note that both types of meters care about direction. In the earlier 
ﬁgure, the voltmeter has plus and minus signs showing which polarity of voltage 
gives positive readings. This is a reference direction. It does not necessarily imply 
that the voltage has the shown polarity. The point is that by having a reference, you 
will be able to tell by the sign of the readings the true polarity. Of course, ﬂipping 
the leads of the meter will ﬂip the sign of the results. A similar argument holds for 
the arrow on the current meter - it is just a reference direction. As we will see, it is 
essential that you keep careful track of the directions.
There are some basic laws that you can apply to across and through variables. 
These are called Kirchhoffs Laws, and we will later give lofty deﬁnitions for these. 
But for now, we can easily present where they come from. Kirchhoff’s Current Law, 
or KCL for short, simply says that current is a conserved quantity - if some amount 
of current ﬂows into a part of a circuit, the exact same amount must ﬂow out. Kirch-
hoff’s Voltage Law, or KVL for short, just says that the voltage that you drop on one 
side of a circuit must be equal to the amount of voltage you raised on the other side. 
Or in other words, you can only fall the height you were raised. These laws may 
seem painfully obvious, but when shrouded in mathematics, they appear obscure, 
yet shockingly powerful.
Before we move onto applying our understanding to the problem at hand, we need 
to mention one more concept - power. As you may recall from basic physics, power 
is the ﬁrst derivative of energy with respect to time, i.e. energy per unit time. It is 
generally measured in Watts. If potential energy is just voltage times charge, and 
current is the ﬁrst derivative of charge with respect to time, then voltage times cur-
rent must be power. Or in equation terms, P = I V. A circuit element can either pro-

duce power, or dissipate power. To make life easier, we will deﬁne P to be positive 
for things which dissipate power (like lightbulbs), and negative for those things 
which produce power (like batteries). This may sound a little odd, but it is the stan-
dard convention. To make this work out, when measuring the current into an ele-
ment, we deﬁne positive current ﬂow as that going into the positive terminal. 
Although this choice was initially arbitrary, you must follow it meticulously. Fail-
ure to do so is the most common source of errors for people ﬁrst learning how to 
solve circuits.
What is an LED?
A Light Emitting Diode, or LED, can be thought of as a semiconductor light bulb. 
They come in a variety of colors - red, green, orange, yellow, and occasionally, blue 
- and they are ubiquitous. From power lights to brake lights, LEDs are everywhere.
LEDs are nonlinear devices. What is meant by that is that as you vary the voltage 
across them, the current does not vary proportionally. In fact, it varies exponen-
tially! Here’s a schematic of an experiment where we will vary the voltage across 
an LED, and measure the current through it. Note the symbol for the LED. The 
arrows indicate the light coming from the LED. By varying the voltage source and 
noting the meter readings, we produce something called an I-V curve which is 
shown below.
Examine the shape of the I-V curve. It has some rather interesting properties. First, 
you will notice that there is essentially no current ﬂow for negative voltages. For 
small positive voltages, there is a very small current ﬂow, which rapidly increases at 
higher voltages. For most LEDs, this rapid increase in current generally occurs

What is an LED?
around 1.4V, although this varies widely depending upon the type of device. Near 
this turn-on voltage, very small changes in voltage can cause dramatic changes in 
current.
For an LED to operate properly, we would like to provide a current somewhere 
between 1 to 10 mA. (A milliamp, or mA, is 1/1000 of an amp.) From our BASIC 
Stamp 2, we have a 5 V supply. If we put this across our LED in the positive direc-
tion a massive current would ﬂow, possibly damaging the LED, the Stamp or/and 
the power supply. (This might well produce what Bob Pease, celebrated circuit 
guru, calls a DED - Darkness Emitting Diode.)
A very bad idea is to try and build a voltage source which is at just the right voltage. 
The reason this idea is so bad is that the I-V curve, and thus the required voltage, 
vary depending upon the particular LED, the temperature, the phase of the moon, 
etc. and slight shifts cause dramatic changes in current. It would be much better to 
set up the circuit such that these minor variations do not cause substantial current 
changes.
It turns out that a circuit which accomplishes this goal is very simple. The idea is to 
use a resistor to set the current. A resistor is a linear device - its I-V curve is a 
straight line with current proportional to voltage. The constant of proportionality is 
called the resistance, and is measured in ohms, which is often denoted by the Greek 
letter Omega (Ω). You may have heard of Ohm’s Law which states that V=IR. This 
is not so much a law, as an empirical observation which applies well to most, but 
not all materials. (Obviously, it does not apply to LEDs!)
The preferred LED circuit is shown below. It consists of three circuit elements: a 
5V power supply, a resistor and an LED. Note that we have labeled the voltage 
across the resistor as VR, and the voltage across the LED as VLED. We have also

labeled the current ﬂowing through the circuit as I. Like a collection of pipes tied 
end-to-end in a circle, the way the circuit is wired demands that the exact same cur-
rent ﬂows through the voltage source, the resistor and the LED. (Remember KCL?) 
So there is only one current label.
KVL is useful in analyzing this circuit. If we start with 5V from the voltage source, 
then we must drop 5V in the rest of the circuit. Clearly, this is done in two steps - 
VR across the resistor, and then VLED across the LED. The sum of these two must 
equal 5V. In equation form:
We can also write equations corresponding to the I-V curves for a resistor, and for 
an LED. For the resistor:
The LED I-V curve is an exponential. A reasonable equation for it might be:
where I0 and VT are constants. This is kind of ugly, so we will make a fairly reason-
able simpliﬁcation. Looking at the LED I-V curve, you can approximate it with two 
straight lines as shown below:
For I > 0, the equation becomes VLED = 1.4V, which is the vertical segment of the 
curve. Since we want some current to ﬂow in our circuit, we will be operating the 
LED on this portion of the curve.

What is an LED?
We now have all the equations we need to complete our analysis of this circuit. 
Plugging in our value for VLED yields:
Solving for the resistor voltage, we get:
Finally, we can plug this back into the Ohm’s Law equation for the resistor to ﬁnd 
what size resistor we need to get I = 10mA.
Thus, by using a resistor of 360Ω, we will get a current of 10mA.
The remaining question is, did this solve our original problem about sensitivity to 
the variation in the LED turn-on voltage - the point where the I-V curve turns 
upwards. To get at this, we must write the equation for the current, I, in terms of this 
voltage which we shall denote, VD.
From this equation, we can calculate how the current changes with the LED turn-on 
voltage. For example, if VD varied from 1.3 to 1.5V, then the current would vary 
from 10.3mA to 9.7mA. This is an acceptable variation.

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
We can use this wonderful little circuit with the Stamp. Any of the 16 I/O pins can 
serve as a voltage source which can be programmed to deliver either 0V or 5V 
using the “high” and “low” commands. Of course, these pins are not ideal voltage 
sources, but at these current levels, they will be quite adequate. (Please keep the 
current supplied by any one output pin below 20mA to avoid overstressing the 
Stamp.)
Before you can wire this up in the lab, you need to know a little bit more about the 
components. Typically, LEDs have two leads, one longer than the other, and one 
side of the case is ﬂattened slightly. These are used to indicate which are the posi-
tive and negative (or, as they are called in the case of diodes, the anode and the 
cathode, respectively). Unfortunately, not all manufacturers have uniformly agreed 
upon which is which. Typically, the lead near the ﬂattened side is the negative one. 
However, a better way to tell is to look inside the LED. The lead with the “ﬂag” is 
almost always the negative one. I say “almost always” because there are so many 
new LED structures coming out now (including organic ones!) that I’d be afraid to 
call anything an absolute certainty.
Hopefully, you have access to various size resistors, along with a chart explaining 
the resistor color codes. However, we will be using DIP (Dual-In-line-Package) and 
SIP (Single-In-line-Package) resistors, which might make your wiring job easier. 
The way the resistors are connected in these sorts of packages varies widely. You 
should have DIP resistors which are electrically separated, with each connecting to 
pins horizontally across the package. In addition, you will need SIP resistors which 
have one side of each resistor connected to pin 1, with the other sides connecting 
separately to the remaining pins. Usually, the resistor values are all the same in a 
given package, and this is probably stamped as a three digit code on the top some-
where. The ﬁrst two digits are read directly, followed by some number of zeros 
indicated by the third digit. For example, 102 is a 1000Ω (1kΩ) resistor.
How Do I Interface a Switch?
To get signals into the Stamp, you must provide valid logic levels of either 0V or 
5V. Given a simple switch which is either open or makes a connection, how do you 
do this?
You might think you could use the following circuit:

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
17
How Do I Interface a Switch?
This circuit will not work well. The problem is beyond the scope of our current dis-
cussion, so we will leave it to say that the input must be actively driven to both 5V 
and 0V. With the addition of a single resistor, we can make this happen as shown 
below:
The resistor provides a path to ground, removing any residual charge on the input 
pin that could leave it ﬂoating at 5V. This solves the electrical problem.
Unfortunately, we still have a mechanical problem. When the two contacts of the 
switch hit together, they tend to bounce off of each other a few times before settling 
down. It’s very similar to what happens when you drop a ping-pong ball on a hard 
surface. Most mechanical switches have this bounce problem. However, you proba-
bly never noticed it because the bouncing generally only lasts about 1/100th of a 
second. The problem is that the BASIC Stamp is plenty fast to see each of these

bounces as separate hits. So if you are trying to create a system which counts switch 
presses, you might count individual presses as multiple ones.
Solutions to this problem are known as debouncing. While you can do this in hard-
ware, the Stamp can do it in software much more efﬁciently. The idea is to ignore 
the switch for some amount of time after the initial hit to allow the bouncing to 
stop. The “button” command does this automatically. See the Stamp documentation 
for more details.
What is a Seven Segment Display?
At this point, we’ve ﬁgured out how to turn on LEDs using current-limiting resis-
tors, and how to interface a switch. However, the initial problem called for a seven 
segment LED display. What is that?
In fact, you’ve probably seen them many times on cash registers, on digital clocks, 
on the front panel of personal computers indicating the clock speed, etc. They are a 
collection of seven LEDs (not counting the decimal places) combined in a single 
package, and arrange to display numbers. The typical arrangement is shown below:
By turning on the appropriate segments, the digits 0-9 can be displayed. For exam-
ple, to display the number 3, segments a, b, c, d, and g would be lit. Many displays 
also have LEDs in the appropriate place for decimal points (often labeled “dp”).
With all these LEDs, the number of wires could get very large. Since one side of all 
the LEDs will generally be connected to ground (or 5V in some cases), these con-
nections are made internally. So there should be a common connection, and one for 
each segment.

What is a Seven Segment Display?
Our displays are common anode. The common connection is the positive side 
(anode) of the LEDs. This changes the circuit slightly. Instead of having the Stamp 
output supply the 5V, we will connect to the 5V supply and have the Stamp output 
pull down to 0V. This really is equivalent, because all that matters is the voltage dif-
ference. The schematic below shows the connections:
With this scheme, you set an output low in order to turn on the corresponding LED. 
When an output is at 5V, the LED is off because there is no potential difference 
across the circuit - no current can ﬂow.
Because you will be driving many LEDs, you may ﬁnd it useful to learn some of 
the Stamp instructions which will make it easy for you to store patterns, and output 
them to the pins. The “lookup” command makes it easy to select a pattern which 
you can use to drive the pins. This works particularly well when the patterns are 
speciﬁed in binary, and you deﬁne a variable which is the pins.
Here’s an example program which will light up one LED, two LEDs, three LEDs, 
four LEDs, and repeat that pattern forever. With your Stamp manual in hand, study 
this program and make certain you understand how it works.

Where Do We Go Next?
This chapter looked at ways to interface the Stamp to lights and switches. To really 
understand what was going on, we had to get a little down and dirty, looking into 
the physics of what voltage and current are. Gratefully, we can leave the physics 
portion of this class behind, at least until we get to capacitors.
The real world consists of more than on/off lights and switches. Most frequently, 
we will be dealing with quantities which vary over a continuum. In the next several 
chapters, we will be exploring ways of having the Stamp’s on/off world talk with 
our continuous world. In the process, we’re going to be learning quite a bit about 
circuit theory. Hold on to your hats!

The Problem
The Stamp is a digital device. It talks in terms like on/off, true/false, 1/0, high/low, 
or yes/no. But what about that gray area in-between? The real world is ﬁlled with 
quantities that span some continuum. It’s not always yes or no - sometimes the 
answer is maybe. 
Your task for this chapter is to build a simple 3-bit digital to analog convertor using 
your Stamp and a resistor network. With three bits, you should be able to select 
eight different voltage output levels. These levels should be equally spaced. To 
select a level, you should have an up switch and a down switch which increment or 
decrement respectively the current setting. A seven segment display should indicate 
which level has been chosen. Verify the functionality of your circuit using a digital 
multimeter.
Note: You will probably be able to reuse a great deal of your wiring from the previ-
ous chapter!

What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are a few things you need to know:
• What is a voltage divider?
• How do I solve more complex resistive circuits?
• Are there any tricks that can make this easier?
• What is an independent source and what is superposition?
• What is a digital to analog convertor?
 What is a Voltage Divider?
The Stamp lives in a digital world of 5V or 0V. But what if you wanted to use the 
Stamp to generate voltages in-between? How do you go about this?
In the previous chapter, we saw that a voltage drop occurs as current ﬂows through 
a resistor, and that the magnitude of this voltage is given by Ohm’s Law. By adjust-
ing the current, we change the voltage. We also saw that a resistor could be used in 
the LED circuit to help set the current. This suggests a circuit utilizing two resistors 
as shown below.
This circuit is known as a voltage divider. From KVL, we know that VR1 + VR2 
must equal V. By adjusting the two resistor values, we can change the split of how 
much of V drops across each resistor, but the sum of the voltages remains the same.

What is a Voltage Divider?
Let’s solve the voltage divider circuit. Because this network consists of a single 
loop, the current, I, must be the same everywhere. (That’s KCL in action!) Each of 
the resistors obeys Ohm’s Law, giving two equations: VR1 = I R1 and VR2 = I R2. 
Substituting these into our KVL equation, we get:
Turning this around, we get an equation for I:
This looks an awful lot like Ohm’s Law. In fact, two resistors stacked end to end 
forcing equal currents, acts just like a single resistor with a resistance equal to the 
sum of the two. This is called a series connection. Resistors in series add.
We can plug this current back into Ohm’s Law for each resistor to ﬁnd the voltage 
across them. For R1:
Similarly, for R2 we get
As expected, V is divided between the two resistors. You should note that the bigger 
resistor will have the larger voltage drop. (With the same current ﬂow, a bigger 
resistor has a bigger voltage drop.) If the two resistors were the same size, you 
would get the same voltage drop (half the supply voltage) across each of them.
While we have calculated the voltage drop across each resistor, these may not be 
the voltages we are seeking. In most circuits, we like to talk about the voltage at 
various points in the circuit with respect to ground. (We are always very respectful 
of ground.) The decision of what to call ground in this circuit is fairly arbitrary, but 
the negative terminal of the voltage supply would be a customary choice. From 
here, there are really only two other points to measure to - the positive of the sup-
ply, and in-between the two resistors. (Although we never stated it explicitly, all ter-
minals directly connected by ideal wires are at the same voltage. We call these 
nodes. The voltage divider circuit has three nodes, counting the ground node.) Of 
course, the voltage across the supply is just the supply voltage, so that leaves only

one interesting voltage to measure - the voltage in-between the resistors. With 
respect to our ground, this is just VR2.
Let’s consider a speciﬁc example. In the circuit shown below, we wish to calculate 
the voltage, Vout. (In the ﬁgure, we show the test wires coming out where we would 
measure Vout. Of course, Vout is identical to VR2.) 
We begin by noting that the resistors are in series. Applying our result from before, 
we know that resistors in series effectively add together. This gives us 5V across a 
10kΩ resistance, yielding a current, I, of 0.5mA. This current ﬂows through each 
resistor. The voltage across the ﬁrst resistor is given by VR1 = I R1 = 2V. For the 
second resistor, VR2 = I R2 = 3V. This is Vout. We could also have calculated this 
directly from the voltage divider equation:
It is also good to verify that KVL works. VR1 + VR2 = 2V + 3V = 5V.
How Do I Solve More Complex Resistive Circuits?
By using a voltage divider, we can generate virtually any voltage between 0V and 
5V using two carefully chosen resistors. However, the problem for this chapter asks 
us to build a system that will produce a number of different voltages under program 
control. Before we can do that, we need to learn more about network theory.

How Do I Solve More Complex Resistive Circuits?
In general, a circuit consists of a network of interconnected elements. Nodes are the 
points where the elements connect together. Branches refer to the paths currents can 
take through the circuit. Consider the circuit shown below:
This circuit has three nodes, labeled A, B and C. Since we measure voltage between 
two nodes, let us choose node C as our ground. That leaves only two voltages to 
measure - the voltage between nodes A and C, which we’ll call VA, and the voltage 
between nodes B and C, VB. The voltage between nodes A and B could also be 
measured, but it will just be the difference VA - VB. In general, a circuit with n 
nodes has only n - 1 unique voltages associated with it. The voltages across each 
element can be expressed in terms of these unique voltages. For example, VR1 = VA 
- VB, and VR2 = VR3 = VB.
Let’s reconsider Kirchhoff’s laws, and state them more formally.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law: The sum of currents into or out of a node must be zero.
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law: The sum of the voltages around any closed loop must be 
zero.
To illustrate KCL, consider node B. The sum of the currents into node B are:
Note the signs of the currents for R2 and R3 in the equation. These are negative 
because these currents are deﬁned as ﬂowing out of node B.

We can put this equation in terms of voltages by applying Ohm’s Law. This gives:
This can be rearranged, yielding:
Noting that VA = V, we can solve for VB:
Knowing VB, we can now easily solve for all circuit variables. Since such calcula-
tions are tediously straight forward, we will leave them as an exercise for the reader.
Just as there are many ways to skin a cat, there are many ways to solve a circuit. 
KVL provides us with another way of arriving at a complete set of equations. There 
are three distinct loops in the circuit. These are illustrated in the ﬁgure below. For

each of these loops, we can write a KVL equation. In the case of loop1, the equa-
tion contains terms for the voltage source, R1 and R2. It is:
Note the sign of the ﬁrst term. As we go around the loop, we hit the negative end of 
the supply ﬁrst, so this term has a negative sign. For loop2, we get the simple equa-
tion:
Applying Ohm’s Law, these equations become relations in terms of currents. Spe-
ciﬁcally:
and:
Combining this with the KCL equation IR1 = IR2 + IR3 gives us three equations in 
three unknowns. Solving these equations will give the same solution as we obtained 
earlier, but only after considerable manipulation. In fact, extensive use of loop 
equations is avoided because they almost always result in more cumbersome alge-
bra.
Are There Any Tricks That Can Make This Easier?
By now you must be thinking that solving circuits is a pretty tedious business. In 
the most general cases, it is. However, if you learn a few tricks, most practical cir-
cuits can be solved very rapidly. For those that do not succumb to these techniques, 
there are computer programs which can quickly solve any resistive circuit. 
One of the most basic tricks we have already seen. Resistors in series add. We really 
only showed this for two resistors, but it does apply to any number of resistors in 
series. (You can convince yourself of this with an iterative argument: combine the 
ﬁrst two resistors into one, then combine that with the third, and so on.)

tion had R2 and R3 in parallel. In a series connection, all elements have the same 
current running through them. In a parallel connection, all elements have the same 
voltage across them.
It turns out that there is a convenient formula for calculating the effective resistance 
of a bunch of resistors connected in parallel. Given the same voltage, V, across all 
the resistors, the total current is the sum of the individual resistor currents:
Bringing the resistances to the other side of the equation produces:
So the effective resistance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the resis-
tances. (Try saying that quickly ten times...) This relationship is so useful that it is 
worth wasting the brain cells to commit it to long term memory.
Using these two tricks, we will now demonstrate how quickly they can be used to 
solve a circuit. Once again, we consider our example circuit from the previous sec-
tion. In that circuit, R2 and R3 were in parallel. In terms of the rest of the circuit, 
these two resistors look like a single resistor of value:
We can redraw the circuit with this effective resistance, R23, replacing R2 and R3 
as shown below.

Presuming we wanted to calculate VB, we have a number of methods available. For 
example, we could calculate the voltage drop across R1, and subtract this from V. 
Another possibility would be to directly use the voltage divider equation. This 
would be:

What is an Independent Source and What is 
Superposition?
In journalism, an independent source is someone that can verify information in a 
fashion that does not depend upon your other sources. In circuits, an independent 
source is a voltage source or a current source which does not depend upon other cir-
cuit currents or voltages. Yes, this is a horribly strained metaphor. Let’s put this in 
simpler terms.
If you had a bag full of batteries, you would have a bag full of independent voltage 
sources. It’s that straight forward. Dependent sources, which we will be discussed 
in the next chapter, put out a voltage or current depending upon some other voltage 
or current in the circuit. An example would be an ampliﬁer where the output voltage 
is so many times the input voltage. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. Inde-
pendent sources are just simple power supplies.
We’ve used independent voltage sources throughout the last two chapters. There are 
also independent current sources which force a given current through a circuit. Bat-
teries and other inexpensive power sources are mostly voltage sources. However, 
more expensive lab power supplies can often run as either ﬁxed voltage or ﬁxed 
current sources. Whereas the I-V curve for a voltage source is a vertical line, a cur-

What is an Independent Source and What is Superposition?
rent source is a horizontal line. If you think about this, that means that voltage 
sources are kind of similar to 0Ω resistors (a vertical I-V curve through the origin), 
and current sources are like inﬁnite value resistors (a horizontal I-V curve through 
the origin). We’ll come back to this point later.
In order to use your Stamp to create different voltages (your problem for the week), 
you will be combining several output pins into a single circuit. You could solve 
these circuits using the techniques we have already discussed. However, because 
you will be using independent sources with a linear network, there is another useful 
trick to learn that will make the analysis much easier.
Consider the circuit shown below:
Using KCL, we can write the equation at V as:
Solving for V is straightforward, producing:
If the problem had more nodes and more sources, the algebra gets unwieldy rather 
quickly. There must be a better way.
If you examine this solution, you will notice that it really has two parts: one due to 
V1, and the other due to V2. Imagine for a moment that V2 was set to 0V. A voltage

source of 0V is essentially a wire, so we may now consider R2 and R3 to be in par-
allel. In fact, this is exactly the same problem we solved earlier. The voltage is:
This suggests a general technique. A circuit with multiple independent voltage 
sources can be solved by considering the effect of each voltage source indepen-
dently, and then adding the solutions together. When a voltage source is not being 
considered, it is replaced by a short. This technique is known as superposition, and 
it really does work!
Basically, superposition succeeds because the elements are all linear. Every incre-
ment in current in a resistor creates proportional increases in the voltage. So what 
ever amount each source adds in, adds in linearly, in addition to what all the other 
sources are contributing.
Unfortunately, superposition doesn’t always work. It depends upon the circuit being 
linear. If you have a nonlinear element in your circuit, like an LED, this just plain 
doesn’t work. (Equal increments in voltage across an LED can cause wildly varying 
changes in current.) Another limitation is dependent sources. We will discuss how 
to deal with those in the next chapter. For the moment though, you may revel in the 
elegance of this technique.
What is a Digital to Analog Convertor?
A digital to analog convertor is a device which takes digital inputs, and outputs a 
number of different voltage levels. For example, in your compact disk player, the 
16-bit digital to analog convertor, or DAC, takes the binary data from the disk, and 
puts out a rapid sequence of voltages chosen from a list of 65536 different levels. 
These levels are so closely spaced, that they are termed analog - meaning that they 
are a continuum of voltages rather than simply high or low.
Your goal for this chapter is to build a 3-bit DAC. So you will be using your Stamp 
to produce various 3-bit numbers (that means eight different possibilities) which 
will drive a resistor network so as to produce different voltage levels.

What’s Next?
The circuit conﬁguration you will be using is called an R-2R ladder. The basic cir-
cuit is shown below. Resistors of two different values are used: R and 2R. The volt-
age sources shown are the Stamp outputs.
As part of your preparation for this lab, you will need to analyze this circuit. You 
should calculate V2 as a function of the Stamp outputs switching from 0V to 5V in 
the eight possible patterns.
Hint: This circuit has some wonderful properties that make it very easy to analyze. 
Start at one end, and think parallel and series combinations.
What’s Next?
In this chapter, we learned how to generate a range of output voltages. That’s called 
digital to analog conversion. But what if you wanted to go the other way and do 
analog to digital conversion? That’s the subject for the next chapter.

The Problem
In the last chapter, we saw how you could use the Stamp to generate an analog volt-
age. In this chapter we consider the inverse problem: how do you measure an ana-
log voltage using the Stamp?
Your task for this chapter is to build a simple 3-bit analog-to-digital convertor. Spe-
ciﬁcally, you will use a potentiometer to generate voltages ranging from 0V to 5V. 
Your circuit will measure these, and drive a seven segment display with the num-
bers 0 - 7 to indicate the degree of rotation of the potentiometer.
Note: You will probably be able to reuse a great deal of your wiring from the previ-
ous chapter. The heart of your analog-to-digital convertor will be your digital-to-
analog convertor!
What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are a few things you need to know:
• What are the limitations on our DAC?

 What are the limitations on our DAC?
In the previous chapter, we built a simple digital-to-analog convertor, or DAC, 
using a network of resistors known as an R-2R ladder. While it is true that this pro-
duces a digitally controllable voltage, it is not easy to make use of it. The problem 
is that if we were to hang a load (such as a resistor) from the output to ground, this 
changes the network, and hence the output voltage. In this section, we will examine 
a way of analyzing this problem.
Voltage sources, current sources, and resistors all have I-V curves which are 
straight lines - they are all linear elements. In fact, it is not too difﬁcult to show that 
if you were to measure across any two points in a circuit consisting only of linear 
elements, the resulting I-V curve is linear. In the case of our simple DAC, we have a 
linear network, and we can safely presume that if we were to measure the I-V curve 
between the output and ground, we would get some straight line.
Now here’s the kicker - a straight line has only two degrees of freedom. For exam-
ple, the slope and the x-intercept completely deﬁne a line. With the circuit shown 
below, by choosing the right resistor value and the right voltage, we can produce 
any linear I-V curve. This is called a Thevenin equivalent circuit.
To prove this, let’s ﬁnd the I-V curve produced using this circuit. The test setup is 
shown below. A test voltage is forced across the two terminals in question, and the 
current is measured. The current through the resistor will be:
Plotting Vtest versus Itest gives the I-V curve shown here.

In fact, we could have found this line even more easily. Since it is a straight line, 
any two points will sufﬁce. Two convenient ones are the short-circuit current, Isc, 
and the open-circuit voltage, Voc. The short-circuit current is the current which 
ﬂows when the test voltage is zero - i.e. the current when the terminals are shorted 
together. By convention, this current is deﬁned as going the opposite direction of 
Itest. (This makes the signs work out more easily.) The open-circuit voltage is the 
voltage at which no current ﬂows - i.e. the voltage when the terminals are left 
unconnected. These connections are shown in the next ﬁgure. From these two mea-
surements, we can quickly conclude that VT = Voc and RT = Voc/Isc.

What are the limitations on our DAC?
The upshot of all this is that the output of any linear circuit, no matter how com-
plex, can be modeled by a trivial Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of a single 
voltage source and resistor. Linearity is a wonderful thing!
Let’s consider modeling our DAC from the last chapter. We’ll consider the case 
when the MSB (Most Signiﬁcant Bit, i.e. the biggest one) is on, but the other bits 
are off. The circuit, redrawn for this particular case, is shown below.
Applying our simple resistor combination tricks, this circuit quickly reduces to one 
with only two resistors.
We can now easily ﬁnd the short-circuit current, and the open-circuit voltage. In the 
short-circuit case, R is shorted out, so Isc = 5V/2R. For the open-circuit case, we 
can use the voltage divider relationship to quickly calculate Voc = 5V R/(2R+R) = 
5V/3. The Thevenin resistance, RT = Voc/Isc = (5/3 V) / (5V/2R) = 2R/3. The Thev-
enin equivalent circuit is shown below. Looking into the terminals, this circuit 
behaves identically with the far more complex circuit we started with.
This simple Thevenin equivalent circuit lets us quickly evaluate what would happen 
with different loads on the output of out DAC. For example, placing a load resistor

of 2R/3 on the output would cut the output voltage in half! Lower resistances would 
depress the output voltage even further. Clearly, the only load resistances that 
would not grossly affect the output would have to be much bigger then RT. This is a 
pretty serious limitation.
The output impedance of a linear circuit is just its Thevenin resistance. Basically, 
this tells us how much current we can draw before we start to change the output 
voltage signiﬁcantly. For our DAC, this was not very much current.
Before we leave this topic, we should note that there is another circuit that can cre-
ate all possible linear I-V curves. It is the dual of the Thevenin equivalent circuit, 
and is called a Norton equivalent circuit. This circuit consists of a current source in 
parallel with a resistor, as shown in the ﬁgure. You should convince yourself that 
this circuit does exactly the same thing as the Thevenin equivalent.
In case you should ever ﬁnd yourself wanting a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, 
you should be warned that a favorite qualifying exam question involves these equiv-
alent circuits. You are given two identical looking boxes with two terminals sticking 
out. One box contains the Thevenin circuit with a one volt source and a one ohm 
resistor. The other box contains the Norton circuit, made with a one amp current 
source, and a one ohm resistor. How can you tell which is which? The answer: you 
can’t tell electrically. However, the Norton box has power dissipating in the resistor. 
So you feel the boxes, and the one that is getting hot is the Norton circuit.

What is an Ampliﬁer?
What is an Ampliﬁer?
At this point we have a DAC, and we have shown that it has substantial output 
impedance - i.e. its voltage will change dramatically depending upon the load we 
put on the output. This is not good. If the DAC is going to be at the heart of our 
ADC, then we want it to be well behaved, acting more like a real voltage source 
(which has zero output resistance).
The nifty little gadget which solves this problem is called an ampliﬁer. Now, you 
may have thought you understood what an ampliﬁer was, but you probably didn’t 
think about the units of what got ampliﬁed. Ideal ampliﬁers can take four basic 
forms. They can produce an output voltage which is a bigger version of the input 
voltage. Or they might take in a current, and produce an enlarged output current. 
More confusing still, they might take in a voltage, and produce a proportional cur-
rent. And ﬁnally, they might take in a current, and produce a proportional voltage. 
These are called voltage amps, current amps, transconductance amps and transim-
pedance amps respectively.
In terms of network theory, we call all of these dependent sources. Their outputs 
depend upon some other measured quantity. A linear dependent source is one where 
the output is proportionally related to the input. For now, we will only consider lin-
ear dependent sources. This allows us to use the full power of superposition and 
equivalent circuits.
There is one small catch. When solving circuits using superposition, we considered 
each independent source separately, suppressing the others. However, this doesn’t 
work with dependent sources. The problem lies in the fact that dependent sources 
can cause a much richer variety of changes to a circuit. For example, a resistor can 
be modeled as a dependent source (the current depends proportionally on the volt-
age). Clearly, removing a resistor from a circuit changes the circuit dramatically, 
and is not a reasonable option when applying superposition. The moral of the story: 
never suppress a dependent source when doing superposition calculations.
Let us begin by considering the simplest possible ampliﬁer; one where the output 
voltage is equal to some input voltage. Consider the circuit below. Here, G = 1. This 
is often referred to as a unity gain buffer.
You may have thought that there wasn’t much point to an ampliﬁer with a gain of 
one, but if you examine the ﬁgure closely, you’ll notice that it has a dramatic effect. 
If the load resistor, Rl, had been placed across V1, a voltage divider would have 

Guess the Number
40
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
been formed, and the load would have seen only a fraction of the voltage Vs. With 
the buffer, the load is directly driven by the dependent source, bypassing the source 
impedance, Rs. No voltage divider is formed, and the load, Rl, sees the full voltage, 
Vs. In this case, the unity gain buffer allows higher current draw without changing 
the output voltage. (It allows inﬁnite current in this ideal case. Of course, in the real 
world, the buffer would also have a small, but nonzero output impedance which 
would limit the current available.) 
By placing a unity gain buffer on the end of our DAC, we solve the problem of 
loading. However, the bad news is that while unity gain buffer chips are available, 
we are not recommending that you use one. In fact, unity gain buffers are usually 
constructed from operational ampliﬁers, and hopefully you have some of these.
Operational ampliﬁers, or op amps for short, are the work horses of the analog cir-
cuit world. They measure the voltage difference between two nodes, and output a 
voltage which is A times greater. Or at least that is the ideal. The gain, A, is so big, 
generally 106 or more, that even very small input differences quickly overwhelm 
the output voltage range. In this case, the op amp clips, generally within a few volts 
of the op amp supply voltage. (Although we don’t often show it on these ideal sche-
matics, op amps must be connected to a power supply to work!)

What is an Ampliﬁer?
Modern op amps (meaning those built after the 1960’s or so) are made from transis-
tors. We’re not going to get into a detailed discussion of transistors here, but we had 
to say something about building precision circuits with transistors. Unfortunately, 
transistors are awfully inconsistent little beasties. The ß of a transistor, which is 
basically its current gain, can vary wildly from transistor to transistor. This is even 
true for supposedly identical transistors. (For example, ranges of 50 to 5000 for a 
given device type are not unheard of!) Circuits built from these devices can be sim-
ilarly imprecise. So when we say that an op amp has a gain of about 106, it might be 
anywhere from 5x105 to 107, or some similarly broad range. The trick is to use the 
op amp in such a way so as the precise gain doesn’t matter, so long as it is large 
enough.
The magic that creates precise circuits out of horribly imprecise components is 
known as feedback. Let’s look at an example to see how it works.
Consider the circuit shown below. For an ideal op amp, no current ﬂows into the + 
and - input terminals. So we can redraw this circuit using the symbology of depen-
dent sources leaving these connections open. The op amp is a voltage controlled 
voltage source. Implicitly, the output is referenced to ground.

The next step is to ﬁnd the output voltage, Vout, as a function of the input voltage, 
Vin. We can write the equation by inspection of the ﬁgure.
Collecting the Vout terms on the left yields:
This reduces to:
for sufﬁciently large gain, A. Thus, the circuit is a unity gain, noninverting, buffer 
that is independent of A, so long as A is large.
Let’s consider another op amp circuit. Shown below is a more general noninverting 
ampliﬁer. In this case, instead of feeding back the output to the negative input, we 
ﬁrst reduce the output with a voltage divider, and then feed back the reduced volt-
age. This has a rather curious effect.
From the voltage divider equation, we can write:

What is an Ampliﬁer?
Plugging this into the equation for Vout, we get:
Collecting the terms yields:
Solving for Vout and approximating for large A gives:
Oddly, the result is an ampliﬁer with gain equal to the inverse of the voltage 
divider’s gain. In fact, there is a general principle here - that you get the inverse of 
whatever you put in the feedback path. We’ll be discussing this more later.
Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on here. The voltage on the negative termi-
nal of the op amp is:
In fact, the positive and negative inputs on the op amp had better be about equal. If 
this were not the case, the output of the real op amp would be pegged near one of 
the supply rails. Basically, the feedback is doing all that it can to try and make the 
voltages on the plus and minus inputs as close to equal as possible. All negative 
feedback op amp circuits should have this characteristic.
This suggests a fast way of solving op amp circuits. If the op amp is setting the two 
inputs equal, why don’t we just assume that has happened, and solve from there! 
Applying this technique to the previous circuit, we see that V- = Vin. If no current 
goes into the op amp inputs, than the current through the two resistors must be 
equal. This gives:

Collecting terms gives:
Solving for Vout yields:
Assuming the inputs are equal turns out to be equivalent to saying that A is very 
large.
Before we leave this section, there is one more thing to say about high gain differ-
ential ampliﬁers. If you look at the input versus output characteristic for an op amp, 
you will note that if the positive input is bigger than the negative input, the output 
quickly saturates near the positive rail. Similarly, if the situation is reversed, the 
output dives down near the negative rail. An op amp without feedback to keep it in 
the tiny linear region is a comparator. A comparator is a device which tells you if 
one input is bigger than another. While real comparators are differential ampliﬁers 
that have been optimized for the comparison task, a generic op amp will work 
almost as well for our low speed applications. In fact, the symbol for a comparator 
is exactly the same as that for an op amp.
How do you build an Analog to Digital Convertor?
At this point, we return to our original objective - building an analog-to-digital con-
vertor, or ADC. There are many different ways of creating an ADC. For now, we 
will use a classic technique called successive approximation.
Have you ever played a game called “Guess the Number”? One person thinks of a 
number within some range. The other person tries to guess it. After each wrong 
answer, the guesser is told whether the guess was too high or too low. Eventually, 
the guesser zeros in on the correct number.
This is exactly how a successive approximation analog-to-digital convertor works. 
You have some unknown input voltage. Using a DAC, you generate a guess. Then a 
comparator tells you whether you were high or low. You modify the guess, and con-
tinue the game until you home in on the value of the input.

How do you build an Analog to Digital Convertor?
If you are very smart, you play the game cleverly. For example, if you know the 
number is between 0 and 100, your ﬁrst guess should be 50. This evenly splits the 
range, giving you the maximum amount of information from the guess. If you split 
the remaining range every time, it will take you log2n guesses to ﬁnd the correct 
neighborhood of n numbers.
For your assignment, you are to build an ADC which reads a 0V - 5V input, and 
tells you which of eight ranges it is in. These ranges should be equally spaced and 
are shown below.
The input will be created with a potentiometer. That’s a big name for a variable 
resistor. Sometimes you’ll hear the older generation refer to them as rheostats. Per-
sonally, we prefer to just call them pots. In any case, these are resistors with con-
nections at the two ends, plus a third connection, called a wiper, which can be 
adjusted from one end to the other. You should have two 10kΩ trim pots. (These 
small ones are usually used to trim, or make small corrections to a circuit, hence the 
name.) The wiper is the middle terminal. You will connect this as a variable voltage 
divider as shown below.
By the way, there are many types of potentiometers. Most are rotary, but some are 
moved linearly, and are sometimes called sliders. On some pots, the resistances 
change linearly with angle. On others, the resistances change logarithmically. These 
later ones are used to control volume levels, and are audio tapered, as opposed lin-
ear tapered. When buying potentiometers, make sure you get the right type - both 
are very common!

noticeable increases in volume from a given level increase proportionally with the

volume level. Audio taper pots allow equal increments on a volume control to 
sound like equal increments in loudness, even though the power has to increase dra-
matically more with each further setting.)
So, without further ado, here’s the big picture:
The idea here is that you will use the Stamp to choose DAC outputs. These will be 
ampliﬁed up to give the appropriate comparison voltages. (You will have to design 
this ampliﬁer. Use a noninverting ampliﬁer as discussed in the previous section 
with resistor values on the order of 10kΩ.) The output of the amp is compared with 
the potentiometer output. After some protection circuitry, the output of the compar-
ator is sent to a Stamp input.
Unfortunately, another nonideality of op amps is that they will only function prop-
erly when the inputs are within the common-mode input range. For the LMC660, 
this extends below the negative rail up to about 2.5V below the positive rail. So to 
make this work with a 0V - 5V input, you will be running the op amp directly off of 
the 9V battery - not the 5V supply! This gives you far more headroom to play 
around in. However, this also means the output can swing above 5V, especially 
since this op amp features rail-to-rail outputs. If you were to connect the output 
directly to the Stamp, you would run the risk of damaging the Stamp. The two 
diodes and resistors form a clamp circuit, which holds this output within the 5V 
supply range. You should double check your wiring before powering up your board!
The op amp chip you will be using is an LMC660, designed by Dennis Monticelli 
of National Semiconductor. It is a quad op amp, which means that there are four op

In the next chapter, we will be examining another technique for performing analog-

CHAPTER 5
Timing is Everything
The Problem
As you might have noticed, we are starting to use up most of the I/O pins available 
on the Stamp. This is unfortunate because we still have more functionality we’d like 
to build into our systems. The problem for this week is to dramatically decrease the 
number of I/O pins that are being used, while simultaneously increasing the capa-
bilities of the system.
Like the previous chapter, your task is to digitally display the setting of a potenti-
ometer. However, instead of displaying a single digit, we would like you to build a 
two digit display which ranges from 0 to 99. If we approached this similarly to the 
ADC from last week, we would need 14 I/O lines to drive the LED displays, and at 
least 7 I/O lines to handle the required 7-bit DAC. In addition, we need one more 
line for the comparator output. That totals to 22 I/O lines - 6 more than we have!
To get around this problem, you will be using a serial-to-parallel driver which 
reduces the required number of I/O lines for the LED display to just three. That 
leaves the DAC as the major I/O line hog. While we could use another serial-to-par-
allel conversion here, we will take an entirely different approach to the problem. A 
simple circuit will be used to convert the resistance measurement problem into a 
time measurement problem - something the Stamp does easily with precision.

What You Need to Know
What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are a few things you need to know:
• What is a serial interface?
• What is a capacitor?
• How do I use a capacitor in a circuit?
• What is an oscilloscope?
 What is a Serial Interface?
When driving the LED displays in our previous problems, we used one Stamp I/O 
line for each LED segment. To display a particular number, we needed to set seven 
output lines to the appropriate levels. As long as we wanted the number displayed, 
those seven outputs had to remain at the correct levels.
At a more abstract level, what we were doing was sending seven bits of information 
from the Stamp to the display, using seven individual wires. While this was fairly 
straightforward, this technique does not scale up well to larger displays. Imagine 
trying to build a calculator with a ten digit display. Counting the decimal points, 
that would take 80 outputs - far more than are available on our microcontrollers.
The usual solution to this problem is a multiplexed-display. To build one, all of the 
like segments of different digits are connected together. No matter how many digits, 
this will result in seven (or eight if you count the decimal points) connections. The 
common terminal of each digit goes to its own electronic switch, which connects it 
to the appropriate supply (the positive supply for common anode displays, ground 
for common cathode displays). There is thus one additional connection for each 
digit in order to control the switches, in addition to the seven segment connec-
tions.This is shown in the ﬁgure below. 
The operation of a multiplexed display depends upon a feature of human visual per-
ception known as ﬂicker fusion. If a light is ﬂashed quickly enough, individual 
ﬂashes become imperceptible, and the illusion of a steady light is created. This is 
the basis of movies, TV and ﬂorescent lighting. All of these ﬂash quickly enough to 
give the illusion of steady light. (If you ever have the chance to look closely at a 
movie projector you will see that there is a mechanical shutter which opens and 
closes several times for each movie frame. This is because ﬂicker fusion requires a 

Timing is Everything
50
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
faster repetition than our perception of motion requires.) A good rule of thumb is 
that any light ﬂashing greater than 50 times a second will appear fairly steady.
Multiplexed displays only show one digit at a time. But by cycling through all the 
digits repetitively, very quickly, a multi-digit display is perceived. To drive a partic-
ular digit, its common terminal is connected to the appropriate supply, and the seg-
ments are driven as needed for the number desired in that place. None of the other 
common terminals are connected, so the others are all off.
Unfortunately, the Stamp is a poor choice for creating a multiplexed display. The 
way it is set up makes it very difﬁcult to cycle through the digits while the processor 
is trying to ﬁgure out what should be displayed. Many microcontrollers support 
something called interrupts, which allow a program to be periodically interrupted 
to perform other tasks, like driving a multiplexed display. (If you’ve ever tried to 
install hardware in a PC, you may have run into IRQ problems. IRQ stands for 
interrupt request, and it is how a board signals the processor to stop what it is doing 
and handle data from the board.) The upshot is that we will not be using a multi-
plexed display with the Stamp.
Even though we are not using multiplexing, there is still much to be learned from 
the example. Most importantly, we note that the data, i.e. which segments to light, 
is sent for one digit, then the next, and the next, and so on. The same data lines are 
being used to transmit different data for the different digits at different times. Of 
course, we also have the switches for the commons which indicate which digit the 
data is for. But the key idea here is time division multiplexing - to reuse the same 
wire at different times to emulate multiple wires.
Reducing this to its most minimal form, we could use a single signal wire (and a 
ground, of course) and somehow transmit all the required bits one after another. 
This general scheme is called a serial interface. Serial interfaces are very common: 
even your Stamp talks to the PC via a serial interface! Other examples include

What is a Serial Interface?
infrared remote controls, modems, Apple’s LocalTalk, many PC mice, Ethernet, 
USB, FireWire (an upcoming standard for connecting peripherals to PCs), etc.
The trouble with serial interfaces is knowing where the data is. For example, before 
you start sending data, let’s presume the line is set low. That’s called the idle chan-
nel condition. If you now wanted to transmit a series of zeros, how would you be 
able to distinguish this from the idle channel?
The way of approaching this problem is to create a protocol which uniquely identi-
ﬁes where the data is. There are many types of protocols. For example, RS-232, the 
standard PC serial protocol, uses a start bit which is opposite the idle channel con-
dition to indicate the beginning of data. The receiver sees this start bit, and starts to 
look for data at speciﬁed times after it.
In this chapter, we will be using a National Semiconductor MM5484 16-segment 
LED display driver. (Unfortunately, National recently obsoleted this part, so you 
may or may not be able to ﬁnd it. More on this in a few paragraphs...) This chip 
receives serial data using a special protocol, and appropriately drives 16 output 
pins. These outputs each look like switches to ground which can be turned on or 
off. Once data is received, the switches stay in that state until new data has been 
received. So unlike multiplexed displays, the LEDs are on continuously, instead of 
ﬂashing very quickly. The operation being performed by the chip is sometimes 
called a serial-to-parallel conversion because it takes in serial data, and presents 
multiple outputs at the same time. Find the data sheet for the MM5484, and look it 
over.
The MM5484 is a fairly simple interface chip. It uses a particularly easy serial pro-
tocol which uses two additional wires to indicate when the data is available. One of 
these wires is the clock signal. The other is an enable signal. With enable high, each 
bit is read off of the datain signal each time the clock signal transitions from low to 
high. When all of the data you wish to display at the next moment has been trans-
mitted, enable is brought low, and the output changes at that moment to reﬂect the 
new data. This type of protocol, where there are extra signal lines to indicate when 
to look for the data, is said to be synchronous. On the other hand, asynchronous 
protocols must somehow structure the data stream so the data can be found without 
the extra signal lines, typically a much harder task.
Let’s consider an example. In the ﬁgure shown below, we are transmitting the data 
10111. We begin by setting enable high. Next we present the ﬁrst data bit, a 1, on 
datain. Switching the clock from low to high causes this bit to be read. However, 
the display will not be updated until we bring enable low, which we won’t be doing 

Timing is Everything
52
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
until we’ve sent all the data bits. We do this by successively placing the bits on 
datain, and transitioning the clock from low to high. Finally, when all the bits have 
been received, we set enable low, updating the display. The data will appear at the 
outputs, setting D1, D2, D3, and D5 to open, and pulling D4 low. (Note that the 
data goes in most signiﬁcant bit ﬁrst.)
This may sound like a complex series of operations to program. Fortunately, your 
Stamp has special instructions speciﬁcally for talking with serial devices that 
greatly simplify the task. In particular, SHIFTOUT is a command which outputs a 
variable bit by bit on a pin, while creating the appropriate clock signals on another 
pin. The Stamp manual includes an application note on the use of SHIFTOUT, and 
its counterpart, SHIFTIN. Please read this documentation. You will have to pro-
gram the enable signal yourself, but that is fairly minor. In order to update your dis-
play you will have to prepare the data (most likely, using the LOOKUP command 
twice - once for each digit), set enable high, SHIFTOUT the data, and ﬁnally output 
the data by setting enable low again.
We strongly suggest that you wire up your two-digit display right away. While it is 
fairly straightforward, it is as much wiring as you have done in any of the labs to 
date. It should now be clear why we used common anode LED displays rather than 
common cathode. Because the MM5484 connects outputs to ground, it only works 
with a common anode display. Of course, you will still need resistors on each of the 
outputs to limit the current through the LED segments. Each output in the MM5484 
is rated for a maximum current of 15mA, so be careful not to exceed this speciﬁca-
tion.
As noted previously, you may not be able to ﬁnd an MM5484. Unfortunately, semi-
conductor companies don’t necessarily make the same parts forever, and this partic-
ular National part has been “obsoleted”. In other words, National Semiconductor no 
longer makes this product. This is a major problem for companies that have

What is a Capacitor?
designed this part into their systems. Either an alternative must be found, or the sys-
tem must be redesigned. Typically, semiconductor companies will send out “Life-
time Buy” notices shortly before obsoleting a part. This gives a user one last chance 
to stock up before the part goes out of production. Rarely, enough new demand sur-
faces for an obsoleted part that the company goes back into production. Somewhat 
more frequently, the obsoleted part is transferred to another company, such as 
Rochester Electronics, which specializes in once discontinued parts. (You’ve got to 
love their company slogan, “Leaders on the Trailing Edge of Technology”...)
As luck would have it, we have not been able to ﬁnd a “pin compatible” replace-
ment for the MM5484. However, there are many parts which offer similar function-
ality. These include: Micrel MM5450, MIC5821, Allegro A6276EA, UCN5832A, 
and Texas Instruments TPIC6C595. These are all serial input, parallel latched sink-
ing driver output parts, but they vary in number of outputs, interfacing, cascadabil-
ity, current limiting, and drive capability. As always, examine the data sheets 
carefully before substituting these parts!
What is a Capacitor?
In comedy, the stock market, and life in general, timing is everything. But up until 
now, we have carefully avoided talking about timing when analyzing circuits. In 
fact, all of the circuits we solved fall under the rubric of “DC circuits”, that is, no 
voltages or currents have been speciﬁed as functions of time. However, as we men-
tioned in the problem statement, we will be building a circuit that will give us a 
pulse, the width of which will vary according to the pot setting. You can’t do that 
with just resistors and voltage sources.
In this chapter, we introduce the capacitor, often called a cap for short. Unlike the 
devices we have study so far, it can not be characterized by a simple I-V curve. In 
fact, if you attached a capacitor to almost any curve tracer, you would get a loop 
instead of a single line. Clearly, this is not a single valued function, so something 
weird is going on.
In order to understand this, we’ll have to once again wallow in some basic physics. 
The prototypical capacitor consists of two parallel conductive plates separated by 
some insulator as shown in the ﬁgure below. Although charges do not actually ﬂow 
between the plates, placing some positive charge +Q on the top plate will push 
away an equivalent amount of charge from the bottom plate, leaving it charged to -
Q. So in fact, from the outside, it looks as if current can ﬂow through the capacitor.

Timing is Everything
54
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
The fundamental relationship for a capacitor is that the voltage across it will be pro-
portional to the charge stored on it. Recall that when we deﬁned voltage, we said it 
was the potential of separated charges. You might think that adding more charge 
doesn’t change the separation, and thus it wouldn’t change the voltage. However, 
adding additional charges becomes increasingly more difﬁcult because the plate is 
already charged, and repels the new charges. Thus, adding each new charge takes 
progressively more work, and this energy ultimately increases the potential.
An analogy with a ﬂuid system might be helpful here. A capacitor is like a tank of 
water. If you are pumping water in at the bottom of the tank you will need increas-
ingly more pressure as the tank starts to ﬁll. The pressure at the bottom, a measure 
of the potential, rises with the rising ﬂuid level. In fact, for a tank of constant cross 
section, the pressure will rise linearly with the amount of ﬂuid in the tank just as the 
voltage across a capacitor rises linearly with the amount of charge stored in it.
In equation form, the deﬁning relationship for a capacitor is:
The constant of proportionality, C, is called the capacitance, and is measured in 
farads, often abbreviated F. One Coulomb of charge stored on a one farad capacitor 
produces one volt. One Farad is a huge amount of capacitance. In the lab, we will 
generally be talking about capacitances ranging from 10-12 farads (or simply, one 
picofarad, written 1 pF, and often pronounced “one puff”) to 10-3 farads (generally 
written as 1000µF).

What is a Capacitor?
As nice as this equation may be, it doesn’t tell us what we want to know: namely 
what is the current as a function of the voltage. Current is the rate of change of 
charge with respect to time, so we can take the derivative of this equation to yield:
In plain english, the current through a capacitor is proportional to the rate of change 
of voltage across it. We can rewrite this in integral form as:
This just says that the voltage across the cap will be proportional to the integral of 
the current into the cap - just like the height of water in the constant cross section 
tank is proportional to the integral of the ﬂuid ﬂow into it. So the voltage across the 
capacitor depends upon the whole history of current ﬂow into it. Now you can see 
why the I-V curve was not just a simple, single valued curve.
An ideal cap does not dissipate energy. No charges actually ever fall back together 
through the insulator, so there is no way to give up the potential energy within the 
device. However, energy is clearly stored in the capacitor, in particular, in the elec-
tric ﬁeld between the plates. Imagine a cap which has no charge across it that we 
then charge up to some voltage, V. We know that the power delivered to the cap will 
be:
Integrating this with respect to time gives the total energy stored in the cap. This is:
Before we move on to considering the use of capacitors in circuits, let’s ﬁgure out 
how capacitors in parallel and series combine. By deﬁnition of parallel, caps in par-
allel have the same voltage across them. The total charge across two parallel caps is 
just:
So the capacitance of caps in parallel is just the sum of their capacitances.

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
For caps in series, they must have the same current going through them. Assuming 
we started with no initial charge on the caps, this means that the caps must have the 
same charge since this is just the integral of the same current for each cap. Applying 
KVL, the total voltage across the series connected caps is:
With a slight rearrangement, we get:
So the capacitance of caps in series is the reciprocal of the sum of their reciprocals. 
You may have noticed that this is just the opposite of what we got for resistors. The 
easiest way to remember these equations is to note that capacitors in series add like 
resistors in parallel, and vice versa.
How Do I Use a Capacitor in a Circuit?
Obviously, we want to use the capacitor in a circuit. The simplest possible interest-
ing circuit consists of a cap and a current source as shown below.
The current source puts out a current which varies over time. In particular, this cur-
rent source is zero until t=0, at which point it instantaneously switches to a current 
I. By KCL, we know that this must be the current through the capacitor. (We’ll be 
pretending that the current actually passes through the cap, since that’s what it 
looks like from the outside.) Assuming that the cap has no charge across it initially, 
the voltage across is described by the equation:

How Do I Use a Capacitor in a Circuit?
So the voltage increases linearly with time, starting at t = 0 as shown below.
Of course, as we noted before, the Stamp outputs are well modeled as voltage 
sources. However, a circuit with just a cap and a voltage source quickly leads to 
trouble. The problem is that a step change in voltage makes dV/dt go to inﬁnity, 
requiring inﬁnite current. Caps cannot change their voltage instantaneously! Of 
course, if we were to hook up a cap to a Stamp output, we wouldn’t get inﬁnite cur-
rent. This is where our model of the Stamp output as a simple voltage source breaks 
down. In fact, the current would be limited by the small output impedance of the 
Stamp output that we generally ignore.
To get around this problem, we next consider a circuit with a time varying voltage 
source, a cap and a resistor as shown below.
By KCL, we know that we have the same current ﬂowing through all of these 
devices. In addition, we will need to know the initial condition of the cap. We will 
presume that Vc(0) = 0. 
Writing the KCL equation at the node shared by the resistor and the capacitor

For t > 0, V(t) = V, allowing us to rewrite this as:
From previous study of differential equations, you will hopefully recognize this as a 
separable equation. Rearranging the terms gives:
Integrating both sides and moving some terms yields:
where K and K’ are constants. Next, we exponentiate both sides giving:
where K” is yet another constant. Since the initial condition tells us that VC(0) = 0, 
then K” = V. The ﬁnal result is:
for t > 0, and VC(t) = 0 for t < 0. A graph of this equation for V = 1 and RC = 1

How Do I Use a Capacitor in a Circuit?
First of all, note the general behavior. At ﬁrst, the voltage on the capacitor increases 
fairly rapidly. But this rate of increase slows down, and the curve approaches VC(t) 
= V asymptotically. If you think about this, it makes tremendous sense. At ﬁrst, the 
resistor sees the full voltage V across it, resulting in a fairly high current to charge 
the cap. As the cap voltage starts to rise, this reduces the voltage across the resistor. 
Thus, the current decreases, and the cap voltage increases more slowly. Eventually, 
the cap voltage is almost identical to V, and the current ﬂow is reduced to almost 
nothing. This is classic behavior for a ﬁrst order system.
Second, we should note the role of the term RC. This is called the time constant of 
the system. If you plug this into the equation, you will see that after one time con-
stant, the system reaches about 63% of its ﬁnal value. After two time constants, it’s 
up to about 86% of the ﬁnal value. After ten time constants, it’s up to 99.995% of its 
ﬁnal value.
Another way of looking at the time constant is with respect to the initial slope. If 
you were to continue a straight line from the beginning part of the waveform, it 
would intersect the ﬁnal value at the time constant. This is a handy way of estimat-
ing the time constant or the ﬁnal value from a graph. We recommend that you take a 
moment to prove this to yourself - it’s quite straightforward.

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
How do you apply this to the problem posed at the beginning of this chapter? It 
actually is quite easy. We can use one of the Stamp outputs to generate a voltage 
which turns on at a given time. By connecting a cap and a pot, we can build a circuit 
which gives a ﬁrst order response. Varying the pot varies the RC time constant. 
Finally, we can use a comparator to determine when the waveform passes a certain 
level, for example, 2.5V. This time will vary according to the time constant. As you 
can quickly calculate, to reach halfway takes approximately.69*RC seconds.
A circuit for doing exactly this is shown above. This circuit allows you to charge 
and discharge a cap with a pot connected to a Stamp output. The voltage on the 
capacitor is compared with a voltage divider which provides 2.5V. Looking at the 
comparator output, the Stamp can measure the time it takes to reach 2.5V.
This is not a good circuit. It has a signiﬁcant ﬂaw. If the pot is turned all the way 
down, it provides zero resistance, and the Stamp output is then directly connected 
to the capacitor. Recall that you cannot instantaneously change the voltage on a 
capacitor because that would require inﬁnite current. This problem can be ﬁxed by 
placing a small resistor in series with the pot to make sure that the resistance never 
gets too small. The ﬁgure below illustrates the ﬁx.
On the software side, you will alternately need to set the Stamp output high and 
low. You can then use the PULSIN command which will track the amount of time 
required to reach the appropriate input. It has a resolution of 2µS, and can time up 
to about 130mS. With the component values shown, the maximum time constant is

11mS. The minimum is 1mS. You should probably pause 5 to 10 time constants in-
between measurements to make sure that the cap is very close to the ﬁnal value 
before starting a new measurement.
This all said, we can now simplify the circuit considerably. The inputs of the Stamp 
switch rather abruptly between recognizing a low or high around 1.4V. So you can 
think of the Stamp I/O pin as looking a lot like a comparator which is comparing to 
1.4V when it is set to an input.
This suggests removing the comparator, and having the Stamp input do the compar-
ison to 1.4V. The ﬁgure below shows the conﬁguration. To use this circuit, you 
should probably only measure one direction, resetting the cap the correct way after 
each measurement.
Incredibly enough, we can simplify this circuit even further. Since a pin can switch 
between input and output, we can use it to serve double duty: at one moment charg-
ing up a cap, at another, timing when it falls back down past a given level, namely 
1.4V.

Unfortunately, the Stamp documentation shows such a circuit, but we caution 
against its use. The schematic is reproduced below. This circuit can damage your 
Stamp! If the pot turned all the way the one direction, the bottom of the cap is effec-
tively tied to ground. That leaves a 10Ω resistor between the Stamp output and

ground. When the output is set high, that implies a current of 1/2 A, a good order of 
magnitude above the maximum speciﬁed current for a pin.
Increasing the size of the 10Ω resistor to 1kΩ eliminates the excessive current prob-
lem. However, this introduces other problems. Ignoring the cap for the moment, 
you will note that this resistor forms a voltage divider with the pot. The voltage of 
the divider is the ﬁnal voltage the cap will settle to. For low resistance pot settings, 
this voltage will be below 1.4V. Thus, the cap voltage might never get above the 
threshold! In fact, if you sit down and ﬁgure it out, you’ll ﬁnd that this is true for the 
ﬁrst 28% of the pots full swing. So you will be unable to differentiate any of the pot 
settings for over a quarter of its range.
It is possible to work around this problem too. Adding yet another 1kΩ resistor to 
the wiper lead guarantees that the divider will be at a minimum of 2.5V. This is 
shown in the schematic below. Also, you will note that the other end of the cap is 
now tied to ground. Theoretically, it doesn’t make much difference where that end 
is tied. However, it is easier to visualize what is going on this way. Also, there are 
some subtle reasons to prefer this conﬁguration, but these are beyond the scope of 
our present discussion.
This is a signiﬁcantly better circuit than that shown in the Stamp documentation. 
However, it does not yield a time which is strictly linear with respect to the setting 
on the pot, although it is pretty close. This nonlinearity could be corrected in soft-
ware if it was a major concern.

All of these circuits have accuracy problems. First of all, capacitors are notoriously 
inaccurate. While it is possible to buy 2% capacitors, ±20% is far more common. 
Worse yet, these values may change dramatically with temperature. For example, 
Z5U caps typically drop their capacitance in half with a 50°C shift in either direc-
tion away from room temperature! Adding to the problem is the fact that the 1.4V 
threshold of the Stamp input may also vary with temperature. The moral of the 
story is that if you wish to build an accurate circuit, you will have to pay close 
attention to both your design and choice of components!
What is an Oscilloscope?
We conclude this chapter with a quick look at one of the electrical engineers most 
valuable instruments: the oscilloscope. You will be using oscilloscopes in the lab to 
examine the various voltages in your circuit. But unlike a simple meter, an oscillo-
scope, or just scope for short, shows you a graph of the voltage versus time.
Early analog scopes consisted of a cathode ray tube (or CRT), a sweep generator, 
and a vertical ampliﬁer. The sweep generator caused the electron beam in the CRT 
to sweep horizontally across the screen. The vertical ampliﬁer moved the beam ver-
tically in response to an input signal. As a result, a picture of the voltage as a func-
tion of time would be presented on the screen.
Unfortunately, CRTs are not like a piece of paper. When you write on the screen, 
the phosphor will emit light for only a short time. The picture must be constantly 
refreshed. You have absolutely no hope of this happening unless the waveform you 
are trying to look at constantly repeats. As luck would have it, many interesting 
waveforms are periodic. With a repeating waveform, you have some hope that the 
same image will be continuously refreshed so that your fairly slow eyes can per-
ceive it.
The earliest scopes had a knob which would let you adjust the sweep frequency in 
an attempt to match the frequency of the input signal. As you might guess, this 
made using scopes a rather tricky business. Fortunately, a much better system soon 
emerged, called triggered sweep, and this revolutionized the oscilloscope.
The idea behind triggered sweep was to try to get the multiple sweeps to start at the 
same place in the waveform each time. This way, the pictures would all line up. 
When the scope sees the input go past a certain level, it would trigger the horizontal 

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering

What is an Oscilloscope?
sweep. Soon after a sweep was complete, the circuit would rearm, and await 
another trigger event.
Of course, this system has some limitations. For example, a complex waveform, 
which has multiple waves in a single period can easily confound the trigger circuit. 
To the trigger circuit, all the crossings of the trigger point look the same so it will 
choose them fairly randomly. Often there is another signal somewhere in the circuit 
with the same period, but without the extra bumps. Most scopes will allow you to 
trigger the sweep for one channel from a different channel so you can synchronize 
to the cleaner signal.
Another problem is that the sweep starts after the trigger event, so you can’t see 
what happened right at the trigger, or before it. A clever solution to this problem 
was the invention of delayed sweep. With delayed sweep you could tell the scope 
not to start the sweep until some amount of time after the trigger. If you adjusted the 
knobs carefully, you could usually set the delay so that the scope was triggering just 
before what would have been the next trigger event.
One of the annoying side effects of triggered sweep is that if you don’t get a trigger, 
there is no sweep, and hence no picture. Thus, you have no way to tell how you 
should be adjusting your trigger. Auto triggering was a convenience feature that 
was added to make your life a bit easier. If the scope doesn’t receive a trigger for a 
long time, it will automatically trigger, just so you have something on the screen to 
work with. If you don’t want this to happen, you can turn this feature off by setting 
the trigger to normal mode.
Until about ten years ago, that pretty much summed up what scopes were all about. 
But, as you might have guessed, something happened that completely changed how 
oscilloscopes work. They became digital.
The digital storage oscilloscope, or DSO, was yet another inevitable result of the 
digital revolution. A modern DSO is basically a computer optimized for data acqui-
sition. At the heart of the DSO is one or more high speed analog-to-digital conver-
tors. These sample the analog voltages and display them on a computer screen.
When DSOs ﬁrst appeared on the scene, they looked more like computers than 
scopes. This didn’t sit well with the hundreds of thousands of EEs and technicians 
who were used to analog scopes. Eventually, the companies got wise to this, and 
did everything they could to make their DSOs look and feel like analog scopes. So 
in case you were wondering why DSOs have such an odd interface, that’s why: 
marketing.

Timing is Everything

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
That said, digital scopes can do many things analog scopes can’t. But they also have 
some surprising limitations. First of all, digital scopes can digitize a waveform and 
hold it on the screen essentially forever. With old analog scopes, exotic technolo-
gies were used to attempt this feature, but they were crude and expensive.
Another problem with digital scopes is that they truly sample the waveform at vari-
ous instants, and you may not be seeing what’s really going on in-between. Digital 
scopes can alias. Imagine a repeating sine wave with some period, which is sam-
pled with a slightly longer period. The samples look like a slowly moving sine 
wave, but the actual waveform is moving much faster. An example is shown below.
The most serious problem with some digital scopes is a very clever trick generically 
known as non-real-time sampling. Fast ADCs are very expensive. So if you are 
going to be looking at repetitive waveforms anyway, why go nuts trying to sample 
the waveform incredibly quickly. Instead, use aliasing to your advantage! For 
example, take one sample per a period, each time taking it further after the trigger, 
and then recreate the original waveform. This is often called repetitive interleaved 
sampling. It works great for periodic waveforms assuming a good trigger. Other-
wise, all bets are off. If you really want to see a transient waveform (one that may 
only happen once), you’ll need a scope with real-time capability. Unfortunately, 
there is much confusion here because some scopes will automatically switch from 
real-time to repetitive sampling if the ADC can’t keep up. Watch out for this!
Probably the single greatest boon to undergraduate lab measurements was the 
inclusion of an Auto Setup button on most digital scopes. If you press this, the 
scope will try and guess what the appropriate settings should be by looking at the 
input signals. Generally this works pretty well. But it is a far over used crutch, and 
you are advised not to depend upon it exclusively. There is no substitute for a true 
understanding of what’s going on.
Finally, we have to say a word about scope probes. These are the fancy looking test 
leads that are used with a scope. Unfortunately, some people think these are just 
wires. In reality, they generally contain circuitry that helps reduce the loading

effects of the scope on the circuit you are trying to measure. Scope probes can cost 
anywhere from $15 to over $1000 each, so treat them with respect.
Now that you have some idea of the basic principles, you will need to get a demon-
stration on the use of the particular scopes in your lab. You should make sure that 
you view all of the interesting waveforms in your circuit for this chapter.
What’s Next?
In the next chapter, we will examine the inductor. Whereas a capacitor stores energy 
in an electric ﬁeld, the inductor stores it in a magnetic ﬁeld. Circuits with both a 
capacitor and an inductor become particularly interesting because they don’t just 
monotonically approach some steady state in response to a step input. These cir-
cuits can ring like a bell. Be forewarned that the math will be getting a little harder, 
but the results will be more interesting!

The Problem
Imagine you are an employee of Small Town Engineering. Your company has been 
asked by the city of Small Town to bid on a proposed upgrading of the main inter-
section in town, Rt. 660 and Out Street. Rt. 660 is a 50 mph, two-lane divided high-
way, and is a major thoroughfare through this part of the state. Out St. is a lightly 
travelled, 25 mph, one-way road which crosses Rt. 660. (In St. parallels Out St., but 
is one-way the other direction, and crosses under Rt. 660 via a narrow tunnel.) Cur-
rently, there is a Stop sign on Out Street at the intersection. However, the constant 
ﬂow of trafﬁc on Rt. 660 means long waits for those traveling through the intersec-
tion via Out Street. The city engineer wants to install a trafﬁc light to solve this 
problem.
A number of other companies have also been asked to bid on the project. Knowing 
that different companies will propose somewhat different systems, the city engineer 
has requested that each company present a working model of their intersection. You 
have been selected to build the model for your company.
Your task for this chapter is to build the model intersection. In particular, you will 
build a small loop detector which will detect the presence of a “car” (actually, a 
small block of steel) and actuate a “trafﬁc light” (actually six LEDs) accordingly.

 What is an Inductor?
In the previous chapter, we introduced the capacitor. We said that a cap stores 
energy in the form of an electric ﬁeld, and that the voltage across it was related to 
the integral of the current through it.
An inductor is the dual of a capacitor. An inductor stores energy in the form of a 
magnetic ﬁeld, and the current through it is related to the integral of the voltage 
across it.
The prototypical inductor is a wire coil as shown below. From physics, recall that a 
coil with a current running through it produces a magnetic ﬁeld. The direction of 
the magnetic ﬁeld can be determined by the right hand rule. With the ﬁngers of 
your right hand wrapped in the direction of positive current ﬂow, your thumb points 
in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Generating a magnetic ﬁeld takes energy. However, maintaining one need not. 
Magnets don’t require a power source to keep being magnetic. The same is true for 
an inductor. Energy is used by the inductor to create the magnetic ﬁeld. Ideally, this 
energy can later be returned to the system. Ideal inductors do not dissipate power - 
they are energy storage devices.
The deﬁning relationship for an inductor is:
in differential form, or:
in integral form. The constant L is the inductance, and is measured in units of Hen-
ries. A one Henry inductor is a very large inductor. Usually, we’ll be talking in 
terms of mH or µH.
Assuming that there is initially zero current through an inductor (which is the dual 
of saying that there is no voltage across a capacitor), we can calculate the amount of 
energy it takes to get to up to a given current level, which implies a certain level of 
magnetic ﬁeld. This will mirror our derivation for the energy stored in a capacitor. 
We will ﬁrst calculate the power.
Next, we integrate this to ﬁnd the energy.
This is the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld created by the inductor at a given cur-
rent level. Note how similar this is to the expression for the energy stored in a 
capacitor at a given voltage level.
As circuit elements, we can consider the effect of series and parallel combinations 
of inductors. Let’s consider a series connection of two inductors. Since the induc-
tors are in series, they must have the same current, and the voltage across the com-

bination is just the sum of the voltages across each inductor. Solving for this voltage 
yields:
Clearly, inductors in series act like a single inductor of a value equal to the sum of 
the inductances.
Inductors in parallel must have the same voltage across them. The total current 
through the combination will just be the sum of the individual currents as given 
below.
If this is true, it must also be true that the ﬁrst derivatives match up.
This can be written as:
which shows that inductances in parallel act like the reciprocal of the sum of their 
reciprocals. Or, in other words, inductors in series and parallel combine just like 
resistors. It is important to recall that caps did just the opposite.
How Do I Use an Inductor in a Circuit?
Once again, our discussion here will be the dual of our discussion concerning 
capacitors. The simplest circuit we can consider is an inductor connected to a volt-
age source as shown below. Note the symbol for an inductor - a stylized coil.

To solve this circuit, we need an initial condition. In this case, we will presume that 
the initial current through the inductor for t < 0 is zero. We can now directly apply 
the integral form of the inductor relationship.
This result applies for t ≥ 0. A rough sketch is shown below.
This should all look very familiar. It is just like the result for the capacitor, except 
that I and V are ﬂipped, and we now have L instead of C. Just as caps can’t change 
their voltage instantaneously without inﬁnite current, inductors can’t change their 
current instantaneously without an inﬁnite voltage. Of course, you can’t really have 
inﬁnite voltages, but you can get very high ones. In fact, rapidly changing the cur-
rent in an inductor is frequently used as a way of generating high voltages. (The 
ignition coil in an automobile is a wonderful example.)
Let’s consider a circuit consisting of an inductor in series with a resistor and a volt-
age source.

Once again, we will assume that the current through the inductor is zero for t ≤ 0. 
Solving the equation for t > 0 allows us to say that V(t > 0) = V, making this a sepa-
rable equation. Rearranging the terms gives:
Integrating both sides yields:
where K and K’ are constants to be determined from the initial condition. Next we

Applying the initial condition that I(0) = 0 sets K” = V, yielding:
This is another exponential, and says that the current starts at zero, and asymptotes 
to V/R with a time constant of L/R. This is essentially the same relationship as we 
got for the voltage across the capacitor in the previous chapter, with the exception 
that the time constant there was RC.
We can complete our analysis by calculating the voltage across the inductor as a 
function of time. From KVL, we have:
which shows that the voltage starts at V and falls exponentially to zero.
At this point, it would be prudent to examine the differences and similarities 
between inductors and capacitors. If you examine the circuit solution, you will see 
that when we ﬁrst turn on the voltage, the inductor looks like an open circuit - no 
current ﬂows through it. As time progresses, the current through the inductor 
increases, and asymptotes at a level that you would expect for a short circuit. This is 
a general principle. To sudden changes, the inductor looks like an open, and eventu-
ally (with the scale determined by the time constant L/R), it looks like a short.
If you examine the results of the last chapter, you will see that caps do exactly the 
opposite. To sudden changes, the cap looks like a short circuit, but after a number of 
time constants (RC in this case), it looks like an open circuit.
If you keep these results in mind, you can rapidly solve for the time response of any 
network consisting of resistors, a stepped source, and a single capacitor or inductor. 
Solving an example problem will help demonstrate how you can pull all of this 
together. Consider the schematic below.
We will assume that V(t) has been at V1 for a long time (long, that is, compared to 
any time constants in the system) before t = 0. If that is true, then the inductor will 
look like a short circuit just before t = 0, giving Vl(t < 0) = 0, IL(t < 0) = V1/R1 and 
IR2(t < 0) = 0. At t = 0, the voltage source suddenly rises to V2. Eventually, the 
inductor will again look like a short circuit. At that point, we will have Vl(t >> 0) =

0, IL(t >> 0) = V2/R1 and IR2(t >> 0) = 0. All that remains is to determine the 
behavior shortly after t = 0. We know that this will be an exponential, but we need 
to know the time constant.
We have already shown how to ﬁnd the time constant for simple R-C and R-L cir-
cuits. If you look at those circuits again, you will notice that they are really solu-
tions for caps and inductors tied to Thevenin equivalent circuits. Since we can 
model any I-V-R network by its Thevenin equivalent, and we know how to solve for 
the time constants in these cases, we can solve for the time constant of any I-V-R 
network with a single cap or inductor.
Looking back into the circuit from the inductors terminals, we can quickly ﬁnd the 
Thevenin equivalent circuit for t > 0. ISC = V2/R1 and VOC = V2 R2 / (R1 + R2) 
giving RT = R1 R2 / (R1 + R2) = R1 || R2. So the time constant will be:
Putting this all together, we can now write down all the relevant equations. For 
example, the voltage across the inductor will be:

These are simply the equations which match our initial conditions and our ﬁnal val-
ues with the right time constant.
Finally, we can add in one more of our tricks to extend this even further. Ideal 
inductors and capacitors are linear components, allowing the use of superposition. 
You can easily prove this for the capacitor by ﬁnding the current due to the sum of 
two voltages, i.e. V(t) = V1(t) + V2(t).
A proof for the inductor is similar, and is left as an exercise for the reader.
The upshot is that you can now ﬁnd the time response of any network of resistors, 
stepped sources, and a single inductor or capacitor by ﬁnding the response to each 
source individually, and summing these together.
In this last example, we will be using superposition in a particularly clever way. In 
the circuit below, the voltage source will produce a 1 second pulse. We would like 
to calculate the voltage across the capacitor as a function of time.
What has this got to do with superposition? Surprisingly, a great deal. The problem 
with solving this circuit is that we have only solved for the case of a single step in 
the voltage; not a pulse! But, you can think of a pulse as the sum of two steps as 
shown in the ﬁgure.
This circuit is completely equivalent, and easily solved using superposition. Sup-
pressing V2(t) and considering the effect of V1(t), we get:

How Do I Handle Nonzero Initial Conditions?
In the last section we developed a pretty good understanding of how circuits 
respond to step waveforms presuming everything started at zero. Now we consider 
the question of what happens when we have a nonzero initial condition for a cap or 
inductor. We have actually answered this question, indirectly, when we talked about 
superposition. Here we address it speciﬁcally.
Imagine at t = 0, a 1µf cap has 1V across it. This cap appears in the circuit shown 
below.
If we are trying to ﬁnd what happens for t > 0, we don’t care what V(t < 0) was. All 
of that past history has simply resulted in VC(t = 0) = 1V. This is what we call a 
state variable. The state variables of a circuit completely describe the state of a cir-
cuit and no further information about the past is required to calculate what happens 
in the future.
So this leaves us the question of how to calculate how this circuit will respond to 
the ﬂat 2V input, knowing that VC(0) = 1V. Assuming at VC(t = -∞) = 0V, the volt-

age across the cap can be written as the integral of the charge over all time up until 
t.
However, we know VC(t) at t = 0. This is
which allows us to rewrite VC(t) as
This just says that a capacitor with an initial charge behaves just like a cap with no 
initial charge in series with a voltage source equal to the initial voltage on the cap. 
We can even show this schematically.
We can now reform our original problem, adding in a non-time-varying voltage 
source and a cap with zero initial charge at t = 0 as shown below.
This circuit is now easily solved by superposition. (Well, maybe not easily, but at 
least fairly straightforwardly.) Considering either source, the cap initially looks like

a short (and thus has zero volts across it), and eventually looks like an open. For 
V(t) that will set VC’(t >> 0) = 2V. For VC’’(t), VC’(t >> 0) = -1V. Summing the two 
solutions gives VC’(t >> 0) = 1V. But VC’’(t > 0) = 1V, so VC(t >> 0) = 2V. Knowing 
this started at 1V, and that the time constant is RC, we can write:
A very similar technique applies for inductors. An inductor with an initial current 
behaves just like an inductor with no initial current in parallel with a current source 
with current equal to that in the original inductor. Again, we end up with an elegant 
way of handling nonzero initial energy storage.
What is an LC Circuit?
So far, we have restricted our discussion to circuits with single inductors or capaci-
tors. In this section we consider what happens when you connect a cap to an induc-
tor. Mathematically, this will result in a second order differential equation. But 
rather than focus on the mathematics, we will ﬁrst try to build some intuition.
First, let’s make some assumptions. To make life easy, let C = 1F, L = 1H, and at 
time t = 0, we will say the V(0) = 1V, and I(0) = 0A. Since this circuit consists only

of nondissipative elements, the total energy stored in the circuit must be constant 
over time. At t = 0, all the energy is stored in the cap. With E = 1/2 CV2, that works 
out to 1/2 joule.
With 1V across the capacitor, current will eventually start to ﬂow through the 
inductor. This current will continue to ﬂow (in the positive direction on the dia-
gram) at least until V = 0. At this point, the capacitor is completely discharged, and 
all of the energy must be stored in the inductor. If E = 1/2 LI2, then the current 
through the inductor at that moment must be 1A. But that’s not the end of the story. 
The inductor is still pushing 1A of current around the loop, so the cap starts to 
charge the other direction, with a negative V. This will continue until the inductor 
current goes to zero. At that point, all the energy is once again stored in the cap, but 
now the voltage is reversed!. Of course, this -1V across the cap causes a negative 
current to ﬂow into the inductor. And as you might have guessed, this moves all the 
energy from the cap back to the inductor, but with the magnetic ﬁeld the opposite 
direction from before. Finally, the current through the inductor recharges the cap 
back to the original state, and the process continues forever.

It might be easiest to understand this via an analogy. A mass bouncing on an ideal 
spring transfers energy back and forth between kinetic and potential forms. If there 
are no losses (e.g. friction), the mass will theoretically bounce forever. The cap-
inductor system behaves analogously. Energy is completely transferred back and 
forth between the electric ﬁeld in the cap and the magnetic ﬁeld in the inductor.
If you were to work out the differential equation, you would ﬁnd that the voltage 
and the current each oscillate sinusoidally, with a period:
The equation for the voltage across the capacitor would be:
where:
ω is usually referred to as the frequency of the oscillation in radians per second. (2π 
rads/sec = 1 cycle/sec = 1 Hertz)
It is easy to show the current through the circuit must be:
and proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader.
Of course a real LC circuit does not oscillate forever because of various losses that 
this simpliﬁed analysis hasn’t consider. These losses will cause the oscillations to 
gradually die away, and will even shift the frequency somewhat. If you go on for 
further study in Electrical Engineering, you will probably study this extensively. 
But for our purposes, we’ve said just about as much as we’d like to about the theory 
behind LC oscillators.

What is a Loop Detector?
What is a Loop Detector?
Returning to the problem for this chapter, you are asked to build a loop detector. It 
would probably help if you knew what one was. These are the most common sen-
sors that are buried in the road to detect the presence of an automobile in a particu-
lar location. They are frequently used at trafﬁc lights to detect if a car is waiting for 
the light to change. But they are also used on highways to gather data on conges-
tion.
The principle is fairly simple. A coil of wire is buried in the road. A car passing 
over the coil interacts with the magnetic ﬁeld, which slightly modiﬁes the induc-
tance. An electronic circuit detects this change. You may have noticed cuts in a road 
which were made to insert a loop detector.
For your inductor, you should wind 100 turns of 28 gauge magnet wire in an 
approximately 1” diameter loop. (A paper towel or toilet paper tube makes a good 
form for winding around.) Magnet wire uses a lacquer coating for insulation, which 
you will have to carefully scrape off the ends to make contact. This should give you 
an inductor with a value of approximately 1/2mH.
While you could use a simple R-L circuit, similar to the last lab, to measure the 
inductance, we would like you to use the L-C circuit shown below. A Stamp I/O pin 
is used to provide current to the L-C circuit. Set this pin to 5V for some time period, 
waiting for everything to settle out. This will result in some current ﬂow through the 
inductor, but no voltage across the capacitor. Next, set this pin to an input. That has 
the same effect as disconnecting it. This will allow the L-C circuit to oscillate. The 
comparator will amplify these oscillations into valid logic levels. (Be sure to run the 
comparator off of the 5V supply this time to avoid protection circuits!) These can 
then be timed to get a relative measure of the change in inductance.
There is some simple analysis you can do on this circuit to understand its behavior. 
With the Stamp output delivering 5V for a long time, the current through the induc-
tor should be 5mA. (Recall that in the long term, the inductor looks like a short!) 
Disconnecting this pin (by setting it to an input) leaves the L-C circuit hanging off 
of a voltage divider. The voltage at the divider will be 5/3V, and the other end of the 
L-C circuit will oscillate up and down relative to this. With all the energy initially

stored in the inductor, E = 1/2 LI2 = 6.25x10-9 joules. When this moves to the 
capacitor, it will generate a voltage:
Of course, with nonideal components, there will be losses, so this will quickly dis-
sipate.
You should also calculate the period of the oscillation. This will be about 140µs. 
With 2µs timing resolution on the Stamp, you should be able to detect inductance 
changes on the order of 2%. This should be sufﬁcient to detect a steel block placed 
on top of the inductor.

What’s Next?
What’s Next?
Up until now, all of our circuits have been battery powered. And as you may have 
noticed, batteries do eventually go dead. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to power 
your circuits from a standard 110V AC power line?
In the next chapter we will be exploring exactly that issue - how do you generate a 
5V power supply from 110V AC? We will do this in several steps, and along the 
way, introduce some new components. This will include specially made inductor 
pairs which share a common magnetic ﬁeld. These are called transformers. We will 
also be revisiting diodes and capacitors. So you may want to review your under-
standing of those elements.

CHAPTER 7
Off the Wall
The Problem
Batteries are an incredibly expensive source of power. In 1998, electric utilities in 
the United States charge between 5 and 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. On the other 
hand, you would be hard pressed to ﬁnd a 9V battery that could put out a watt for 
much more than an hour. And they cost a great deal more than 20 cents. Power out 
of the wall socket is at least several orders of magnitude cheaper than buying batter-
ies.
Given this economic reality, we would like to be able to power our 5V circuitry 
from a standard 110VAC wall outlet. (Standard, at least, in the U.S.) But connecting 
the Stamp to such a high voltage produces only a momentarily spectacular display, 
ending with a depressing puff of smoke. How does one efﬁciently convert 110VAC 
to a suitable 5V supply?
 Your goal for this chapter is to build an isolated, regulated, linear 5V power supply, 
which runs off of 110 VAC. Not only will this eliminate the need for batteries, but it 
has the side beneﬁt of delivering signiﬁcantly more current than the Stamp’s on-
board 5V regulator which was limited to 50mA. This will allow you to use higher 
current devices such as relays, light bulbs, etc.

What You Need to Know
 What You Need to Know
In order to solve this problem, here are some things you need to know:
• What is AC power?
• What is a transformer?
• What is a rectiﬁer?
• What is a voltage regulator?
 What is AC Power?
In the previous chapters, our power source has generally been a constant value volt-
age source, such as a battery. However, batteries are a remarkably inefﬁcient and 
often inconvenient way of generating electricity. Much of the world’s accessible 
energy is most easily released in thermal or mechanical form.
Arguably one of the greatest discoveries of all time was made essentially simulta-
neously by Michael Faraday (of Farad fame) and Joseph Henry (of Henry fame) 
around 1831. They noticed that when a magnet was passed by a piece of wire, it 
generated a small voltage. In particular, they found that this voltage was propor-
tional to the rate of change of magnetic ﬂux - the faster they moved the magnet, the 
higher the voltage. In physics, this is known as Faraday’s Law of Induction.
The ﬂip side of this may be more familiar. As we reviewed in the last chapter, a coil 
of wire with a current passing through it creates a magnetic ﬁeld. This will allow us 
to create a device which converts a voltage signal into a magnetic ﬁeld and then 
converts it back into another voltage signal. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Faraday’s Law of Induction provides a basis for converting mechanical energy into 
electrical energy. The basic idea is to move a coil of wire relative to a magnetic 
ﬁeld, so as to cross lines of magnetic ﬂux. This will generate a current in the wire. 
Such a device is called a generator and is depicted below. To make things simpler 
mechanically, the coil is usually made to rotate within the ﬁeld. As the coil rotates, 
it cuts through the ﬂux lines, generating a voltage across the coil terminals. When 
the face of the coil is parallel to the ﬁeld as shown in the ﬁgure, it cuts rapidly 
through the ﬂux lines. But when the coil has turned 90° and is perpendicular to the 
ﬁeld lines, at that moment the motion of the coil is tangential to the ﬁeld, and pro-
duces no voltage. As the coil continues to turn past this point, it cuts through the

ﬁeld in the opposite direction, generating a negative voltage. The upshot of all this 
is that as the coil turns, the voltage produced will vary as the cosine of the angle as 
shown below.
This sinusoidal waveform is referred to as alternating current or AC for short. The 
equation for a waveform of this type is:
where A is the maximum amplitude, ω is the frequency in radians per second, and 
Θ is the phase in radians. These three parameters completely specify a sine wave.
Since generators naturally produce sine waves, it is not surprising that these wave-
forms play an important role in circuit design. (In fact, sine waves are the basis for 
much of linear circuit analysis for reasons that we will explore to a limited extent in 
a later chapter.) So we need to have a good handle on describing them.
An interesting question to ask might be what size sine wave do you need to deliver 
the same amount of power as a steady source (often referred to as DC for direct cur-
rent - to distinguish it from AC). Consider the two circuits shown here. For the DC 
circuit, the power dissipated in the resistor will just be IV = V2/R.

What is AC Power?
For the AC circuit, the power being dissipated in the resistor will ﬂuctuate with the 
voltage and current. This will give us something of the form:
To compare this with the DC expression, we will need to ﬁnd the average power 
delivered by this AC source. We can ﬁnd this by integrating the power over one 
period, and dividing by the length of that period. This gives:
Applying the trigonometric identity cos2A = 1/2 + cos(2A)/2 yields:
The second term in the integral is a sine wave that we are integrating for exactly 2 
cycles, and thus sums to zero. Integrating the ﬁrst term leaves us with:
Comparing this with the DC equation reveals that to get the same average power:

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
This average power concept is so useful that AC voltages are general expressed in 
terms of it. When we say that the utility provides 110 VAC, we really mean that 
they provide a sine wave with average power equivalent to a DC 110V. Plugging 
into the equation above, we see that means the actual voltage varies between 
±155.56V.
Rather than calling this something like the DC equivalent voltage, this is usually 
call the root-mean-square, or RMS voltage. If you examine closely the steps we 
went through, you’ll see that we in fact squared the voltage, took the average, and 
then ﬁnally applied the square root function.
AC voltages are not always measured in terms of their RMS value. Sometimes, we 
simply talk about their amplitude - a much easier value to read off of a scope. You’ll 
also see the term peak-to-peak which is measuring from the lowest to the highest 
voltage, i.e. two times the amplitude. When making AC voltage measurements, be 
sure you carefully note which form you are using. Most AC meters will directly 
read out in RMS values. (Note: many meters presume that the waveform is sinusoi-
dal, measure the amplitude, and scale by a factor of square root of 2. If you want to 
ﬁnd the RMS value of a nonsinusoidal signal, you will need to use a meter with true 
RMS capability.)
What is a Transformer?
A transformer is a device where two or more coils share a common magnetic ﬂux. 
The idea is that the primary coil takes in a changing voltage and creates a changing 
magnetic ﬁeld, and the secondary coil converts this changing magnetic ﬁeld back 
into a changing voltage. Typically, the coils are wrapped around a common iron 
core, which serves to channel the magnetic ﬁeld through each coil. An example is 
shown here.

What is a Transformer?
An ideal transformer obeys a simple relationship: the voltage on the secondary side 
will be proportional to the voltage on the primary side, with the constant of propor-
tionality determined by the ratio of the number of turns on the secondary side to the 
number of turns on the primary side (known as the turns ratio). In equation form, 
this can be stated as:
where n is the turns ratio.
Another key feature of ideal transformers is that they do not dissipate power. So 
whatever power goes in one side must come out the other. This too can be written in 
equation form as:
Combining this with the ﬁrst equation yields:
So the current is also scaled by n, but in the opposite direction, and with a sign ﬂip.
Ideally, a transformer would follow these equations, but for a variety of reasons, 
real transformers have some serious limitations. Most important among these is that 
they really only work for AC waveforms, and more speciﬁcally, AC waveforms 
within a fairly narrow frequency range. But with that caveat, transformers are 
remarkably ideal.
Transformers are a major reason why electric power is generally transmitted in AC 
form. With an inexpensive transformer, you can efﬁciently convert a high current, 
low voltage signal to a low current, high voltage one, and vice versa. Not only is 
this handy, but it has dramatic implications for power transmission. Electric power 
lines are run at very high voltages, and relatively low currents. That way, resistive 
losses in the long wires do not cause signiﬁcant voltage drops, and hence wasted 
power. Transformers allow utility companies to use far thinner and cheaper wires.
For our purposes, we will be using a transformer to efﬁciently convert the 110VAC 
(that’s RMS!) available from a wall socket to a more manageable level. You should 
have a wall transformer (often called an AC adaptor) designed to convert 120VAC 
to 12VAC, which means it should have a turns ratio of about 10:1 (i.e. n=1/10).

Examine the transformer output voltage on a scope in lab. Be very careful not to 
connect your Stamp to these voltages.
What is a Rectiﬁer?
Now that we know how to step down AC voltages to a manageable level, we are left 
with the problem of converting 12VAC into our desired 5V DC supply. We’ll 
approach this in two steps: ﬁrst we’ll convert this AC voltage into a DC one via a 
process called rectiﬁcation. Then we’ll step this down to 5V using a regulator.
Fortunately, you have already been exposed to the key component needed for recti-
ﬁcation: the diode. Recall that diodes are two-terminal devices which allow current 
to pass only in one direction. Unlike LEDs, silicon diodes typically drop about 0.6 
or 0.7V when conducting. But for our purposes in this chapter, we’ll tend to think 
of them as ideal, one-way current valves.
The simplest possible circuit for converting AC into DC is a half-wave rectiﬁer. It 
basically consists of a single diode which only allows current ﬂow in one direction. 
A possible circuit is shown below. Note the symbol for the transformer.
The operation of this circuit is straightforward. When VAC is in the positive part of 
the cycle, a positive voltage is produced on the secondary side of the transformer. 
This turns on the diode, allowing most of that voltage to be seen across the load. 
When VAC goes negative, the secondary side is also negative, and the diode is off. 
No current ﬂows in the load during the negative half of the cycle. Hence the name 
half-wave rectiﬁer. The ﬁgure below shows typical waveforms. Diodes used in 
these sorts of circuits are specially constructed to handle the large currents, and are 
often called rectiﬁer diodes, or just rectiﬁers for short.

What is a Rectiﬁer?
Looking at the output voltage, you should be struck by how little it resembles the 
output of a battery. While this output voltage is now positive only, it certainly is 
very bumpy, and not even on half the time. What we need is a way to smooth things 
out - something which will store some of the energy during the on times, and 
release it during the off times. The ideal solution is a capacitor.
In the circuit below, we have added a large capacitor (labelled Cmoby, after the 
whale of enormous dimensions) which can store energy during the on times, and 
release it during the off times. What happens now is that the diode only turns on 
when the voltage on the cap is about 0.7V below that coming out of the transformer. 
The transformer only charges the cap upwards - the diode insures this. Meanwhile, 
the load discharges the cap with our standard RC time constant. The circuit must be 
carefully designed so that the time constant is much longer than the AC cycle time. 
In any case, there will be some amount of ripple on the output as the cap discharges 
between pulses. The sketch below illustrates what happens.
There is something else new in this circuit. Notice how the bottom plate of the 
capacitor is shown with a curve, and the top is marked with a plus sign. That is

because special capacitors are required to get a very high capacitance in a reason-
able space. In particular, you will be using electrolytic capacitors which are con-
structed using a paper soaked with an electrolyte. This gives enormous capacitances 
in a small volume, but also results in the cap being polarized - i.e. it only works 
with one polarity of voltage. If you reverse the polarity, hydrogen can dissociate 
from the internal anode, resulting in a nasty tendency to explode. Therefore, it is 
imperative that you guarantee via circuit design that electrolytic caps never see the 
wrong polarity. Electrolytic caps always have their polarity clearly marked, often 
with a bunch of minus signs pointing to the negative terminal. You should have a 
1000µf electrolytic cap for use in power supply circuits. Caps have a maximum 
voltage rating which should never be exceeded.
(A side note on electrolytic caps: there are now specially constructed, nonpolarized 
electrolytic caps available. These are somewhat more expensive, but at least elimi-
nate the problem of accidentally inserting caps backwards.)
While the half-wave rectiﬁer has the virtue of simplicity, it lacks efﬁciency and ele-
gance. A better solution would use the power available from the transformer on 
both sides of the cycle. Systems of this type are called full-wave recitiﬁers. In the 
days when transformers were cheaper than diodes (shortly after the Jurasic period), 
center-tapped transformer circuits using two diodes were particularly common. A 
center-tapped transformer adds a connection in the middle of the secondary coil. 
This allows you to treat it as two separate secondary coils, with a common middle 
connection. In the circuit shown below, each of these halves are used on opposite 
parts of the cycle, basically stringing two half-wave rectiﬁers together.
The output of this power supply has signiﬁcantly less ripple because the capacitor is 
refreshed twice as often. If we were to remove the cap and look at the waveform, it 
would look something like the ﬁgure shown below. The AC waveform is said to 
have been rectiﬁed. However, this is hardly a constant voltage, and while the addi-
tion of a cap helps cleans things up, there may still be a fair amount of ripple. The

next ﬁgure shows how this is cleaned up by the capacitor. You should compare this 
with the ripple of the half-wave circuit.
In an era where diodes sell for pennies, a better solution is a full-wave bridge recti-
ﬁer. This particularly clever circuit uses four diodes to always turn the output volt-
age the right direction and is shown in the ﬁgure below. If you examine this closely, 
you will notice that which ever side of the transformer output is positive has a path 
through a diode to the positive side of the cap. Similarly, which ever side is negative 
has a path to the negative side of the cap. At any given moment, only two diodes on 
opposite sides are conducting, and this switches every half-cycle.

What is a Voltage Regulator?
The full-wave bridge rectiﬁer is an elegant little circuit for converting an AC signal 
into a DC one. However, it still has some signiﬁcant shortcomings. While better 
than a half-wave circuit, it still suffers from signiﬁcant ripple due to the cap dis-
charging in the short space between pulses. How do we get a really clean 5V out-
put?
The solution is a voltage regulator. This is a circuit which actively monitors the out-
put voltage, and only allows enough current to pass to reach precisely the correct 
voltage. A rough block diagram is shown below. The main components are a con-
trollable pass element (a transistor), a voltage reference circuit, and an op amp to 
drive the pass element such as to force the output to be the proper voltage. (Usually, 
the voltage reference puts out about 1.2V, so the output is ﬁrst divided down by a 
voltage divider to this level before the comparison in the op amp.) Of course, the 
input voltage must be higher than the output voltage in order for this scheme to 
work.
This type of voltage regulator is called a linear regulator. All it does is selectively 
restrict the ﬂow of current from the input to the output. Thus, the current on the 
input must be at least as high as the current on the output. (It will be a little higher 
because some current is needed to drive the regulator electronics.) If the input volt-
age is much higher than the output voltage, there is a large voltage drop across the 
pass element, and possibly most of the power from the input gets wasted right here. 
Linear regulators are notorious for their poor efﬁciency.

What’s Next?
Switching regulators have recently become quite popular. These are far more com-
plex circuits which use energy storage components to regulate the output voltage in 
a very efﬁcient manner. They commonly reach efﬁciencies over 90%. Most per-
sonal computers use switching power supplies for this reason. While it is beyond 
the scope of this class to discuss how these work, you should be warned that switch-
ing supplies can have some rather nasty surprises for you, such as minimum loading 
requirements, and lots of high frequency noise.
Returning to the problem at hand, your design of a linear regulator is made trivial 
by the existence of IC linear voltage regulators. These are typically three pin 
devices - an input, an output, and a ground. They could hardly be easier to use. You 
should have an LM7805, which is a 5V voltage regulator. Take a moment to ﬁnd 
this part, and examine the data sheet. Applying a voltage between 7.5V and 35V to 
the input will give an output voltage of 5V. 
The complete power supply circuit looks like this:
After you have thoroughly tested this circuit, you can use it to power your Stamp. 
However, unlike the 9V battery connection, the output of this supply will be con-
nected directly to the +5V pin on the Stamp.
What’s Next?
At this point, we’ve pretty much covered most of what we wanted to say about 
basic components. In the next section we’ll be looking at using these elements to 
solve instrumentation and signal conditioning problems.

The Problem
You reach into the shower and turn on the water. It feels too cold, so you turn up the 
hot, and turn down the cold. A few moments later, the really hot water has made it 
up to the shower, and you readjust again. Finally, you step under the water and put 
shampoo in your hair. Somewhere, somebody ﬂushes a toilet, and you scream 
slightly as you attempt to jump out of the path of the now scalding water.
Does this sound all too familiar? While indoor plumbing may be what separates the 
United States from third world countries, it has hardly been perfected. Your goal is 
to create a better shower - one that automatically adjusts the ﬂow of hot and cold 
water to achieve the desired temperature. Sometimes, this won’t be possible (for 
example, if there is no hot water left), and you should provide a warning to the 
unfortunate bather as soon as possible. But most of the time, you should be able to 
maintain the temperature with some precision. 
We will presume that you have access to a model shower with pump driven hot and 
cold water supplies which you can turn on and off electrically. Because the pumps 
draw signiﬁcant current, they will have separate power supplies and you will use 
the relays to control them. By turning the pumps on and off, you can control the rel-
ative amounts of hot and cold water.

What You Need to Know
The model showers also have a small mixing chamber. This allows the water to 
reach a uniform temperature before being expelled. You will construct a tempera-
ture measurement device to place in this mixing chamber. The temperature should 
be indicated on your 7-segment LED displays most of the time. You will also need 
to provide a mechanism for the user to be able to select the desired temperature. An 
audible signal should indicate when the temperature cannot be properly maintained. 
Finally, a ﬂoat switch will indicate when the mixing chamber is full, so you can 
maintain an appropriate ﬂow rate without overﬁlling.
What You Need to Know
This project brings together many concepts we have explored in previous chapters. 
In addition, here are a some other things you need to know:
• How do I measure temperature?
• What is an appropriate type of A/D conversion for measuring temperature?
• What is a relay, and how do I drive it?
• How do I make noise?
• What algorithm do I use to control the pumps?
 How Do I Measure Temperature?
There must be literally hundreds of different ways to generate an electrical signal 
which depends upon temperature. For example, the resistance of some materials 
varies dramatically with temperature and these are used in the construction of ther-
mistors - temperature variable resistors. Thermocouples are created by joining two 
dissimilar metals in a circuit. These create a voltage difference via the Seebeck 
effect by having the two junctions at different temperatures. Thermostats use two 
dissimilar pieces of metal with different thermal coefﬁcients of expansion which 
have been welded together, and thus tend to bend in response to temperature 
changes. Simple contacts, potentiometers, etc. can then convert the motion into an 
electrical signal. There are temperature sensitive capacitors, and diodes change 
their I-V characteristics with temperature. Infrared detectors can measure tempera-
ture optically. The list goes on and on.

With all of these possibilities, it might be hard to decide what type of temperature 
sensor to use in a given application. However, to simplify your life, we have already 
selected a device. It is an LM35D temperature sensor integrated circuit, which is 
remarkably easy to use. It has three leads, power, ground and output, and produces 
a voltage which is proportional to temperature in degrees Centigrade. In fact, it is 
calibrated to output 10mV/ºC, with high repeatability and accuracy. This would be 
an excellent time to examine the speciﬁcations in the LM35D datasheet.
Integrated sensors like the LM35D are revolutionizing the way physical quantities 
are measured. Recent advances in micromachining technology allow companies to 
build the mechanical structures of sensors along with sophisticated electronics on 
the same integrated circuit. For example, automobile air bags require a method of 
quickly detecting when a collision has occurred. A typical integrated accelerometer 
has a tiny mass, held in position by electrostatic forces. The circuitry automatically 
varies the strength of the electric ﬁeld to hold the mass in a constant position via a 
feedback control system. A voltage is output which is directly proportional to accel-
eration, with almost no delay, and no mechanical ringing. This incredibly sophisti-
cated electromechanical system ﬁts on a single chip, is extremely reliable and costs 
very little in large quantities.
In the future, you can expect integrated sensors to get smarter and smarter. A recent 
single chip temperature sensor made by Dallas Semiconductor is a complete tem-
perature measurement system. In addition to measuring temperature, it does the 
analog to digital conversion and provides a network interface so that a single wire 
(plus ground) can be used to transmit temperature data from many different sensors, 
each with a unique ID. And it does all this for under $10. There are no circuits to 
design - only software to write for the micro trying to read these sensors.
Unfortunately, you are learning about Electrical Engineering in the midst of this 
tumultuous transition. So while sensors with digital interfaces are becoming more 
common, they are by no means the rule. It is still important that you know some-
thing about reading an analog sensor - properly conditioning the signal, and con-
verting it to digital form. Given current economics, the LM35D is a cheaper 
solution than most of the direct digital reading temperature sensors. But be fore-
warned that this is unlikely to last. However, for many sensor types, it will be quite 
a bit longer before the conversion to digital is complete.
To use the LM35D to measure temperature could hardly be easier. Connect up 
power and ground, and measure the output voltage with a meter. With 10mV/ºC, a 
room temperature of 20ºC will register as 0.2V.

What is an Appropriate Type of A/D Conversion for Measuring Temperature?
What is an Appropriate Type of A/D Conversion for 
Measuring Temperature?
While it was amazingly easy to generate a voltage proportional to ºC, reading this 
with the Stamp is a bit more challenging. In previous chapters, we discussed two 
types of A/D converters - a successive approximation converter which played high-
low comparing the input to a DAC, and a simpler technique where we varied an RC 
time constant to measure a changing resistance. Unfortunately, neither circuit can 
be directly applied to this problem. The former depended upon an accurate R-2R 
ladder, which is painful to construct for a large number of bits. The latter measured 
a resistance rather than a voltage. We need yet another technique.
Temperature changes quite slowly. So you don’t need a high speed converter. How-
ever, you might want a fair degree of precision. And, as always, you want it as inex-
pensively as possible.
The classic solution to this problem is the Dual-slope Integrating ADC. This tech-
nique is about as elegant as they come - simple and precise. Most digital meters use 
it (or one of the many variants), achieving accuracies up to one part in 100,000,000, 
which is 8 digits of precision! (If that doesn’t impress you, try measuring some-
thing easy, like distance, to 8 digits of precision...)
Before we can explain this wonderful circuit, you need to know what an integrator 
is. So we return for a moment to the subject of op amp circuits.
The circuit shown below is an inverting integrator. Recall that the high gain of the 
op amp will try to force V+ = V-, and that there is no current into the op amp inputs. 
In this case, we refer to the V- input as the virtual ground node because the op amp 
will try to keep it at ground. Thus, the current into the circuit, Iin, is just Vin/R. 
Since this current does not ﬂow into V-, it all goes to charging the capacitor. For a 
positive current Iin, the V- side of the cap becomes positively charged with respect

to the Vout side. To maintain the V- node at ground, Vout must be going increasingly 
negative. In equation terms:
The output voltage is the integral of the input voltage, times -1/RC. That is why this 
is called an inverting integrator.
It is important to get the feeling for what is going on here. By tying one end of the 
resistor to virtual ground, the current through it will only be a function of the input 
voltage. (In contrast, the current depends upon both the input and the cap voltage 
for simple RC circuits.) This current then charges the cap, since it has nowhere else 
to go. Of course, the virtual ground concept depends upon high gain negative feed-
back. If you really wanted to truthfully explain what was going on, the argument is 
more complex. As the cap starts to charge, the V- terminal is driven positive. The op 
amp correspondingly swings the output in the negative direction, lowering V- until 
it again approximately equals V+.
While we’re on this topic, we should point out that it is equally easy to build a cir-
cuit which differentiates. Basically, this just involves swapping the cap and the 
resistor, as shown below. The analysis of this circuit is simpliﬁed by assuming a vir-
tual ground at the V- terminal. In this case, the current Iin is given by:

This current must ﬂow through the resistor, giving:
Thus the output is proportional to the derivative of the input.
Now that we understand how easy it is to build an integrator, we can describe how 
dual-slope integration works. The basic circuit is shown below. Initially, assume 
that the integrator output is slightly positive. The top switch is closed, and the input 
of the integrator is connected to Vin. (Vref is left unconnected at this point.) Assum-
ing that Vin is a positive voltage, the inverting integrator output will fall at a rate 
proportional to the input voltage. After the comparator has detected the zero cross-
ing, the integration of the input is allowed to continue for a ﬁxed amount of time. 
After that, Vin is disconnected, and a negative reference voltage, Vref, is applied, 
causing the inverting integrator output to head upwards. The logic then times how 
long it takes until the comparator indicates that zero has been crossed in the oppo-
site direction. The length of time it takes for this second integration will be propor-
tional to the input signal. These signals are diagrammed below.

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
The beauty of this system is its insensitivity to all sorts of errors. It does not depend 
upon the speciﬁc values of the cap or the resistor. And even if these change slowly 
with temperature, so long as they are fairly constant over a single conversion cycle, 
the system is still accurate. Offset errors in the comparator (which cause it to ﬂip at 
something other than equal inputs) also don’t matter because this equally affects 
where the integration starts and stops. This circuit is a wonderful example of how 
analog circuit designers manage to build precision systems with imprecise compo-
nents.
Unfortunately, we have not provided you with a key component to make a dual-
slope convertor - good, electronically controllable switches. JFET and CMOS 
switches are commercially available which perform as almost ideal switches for 
these sorts of applications. But since we didn’t make these available, you have 
probably surmised that we had something else in mind. We do.
Rather than building a dual-slope convertor, we are asking you to build a somewhat 
simpler, but less accurate system. The idea is straightforward: use an integrator to 
generate a linearly increasing voltage of known slope. Compare this to the input 
voltage. When they cross will be proportional to the input signal. This circuit suf-
fers from most of the errors that a dual-slope avoided, but is far easier to build on a 
single 5V supply with our selection of components.
The full temperature conversion circuit appears below. It uses three op amps (3/4 of 
an LMC660 running off a single ended 5V supply). The ﬁrst op amp is used to cre-
ate the inverting integrator. In order to work well off of the 5V supply, the V+ termi-
nal is set to 2.5V. (You may wish to adjust this slightly downwards since this is at 
the edge of the common-mode input spec.) So instead of creating a virtual ground, 
we are virtually at 2.5V on the V- input. Switching the Stamp output between 5V 
and 0V will generate positive and negative currents respectively into the resistor, 
which will in turn cause the output to integrate down and up. Of course, on a 5V 
supply, you can’t integrate beyond the 0-5V range.
Note that there is a 2.2k resistor to 5V on the output of this ampliﬁer. This is just 
one of those nasty little reasons why analog circuit designers have job security. 
Although an ideal op amp, and many real ones, would not require this resistor, the 
particular quirks of the LMC660 require it in this case to achieve stable operation. 
If you try running your circuit without it, you may notice some fuzz when you 
examine the output of the integrator on an oscilloscope. If you zoom in on the fuzz, 
you will see that it is in fact a small amplitude, high frequency oscillation. A full 
understanding of what is going on here is a topic worthy of graduate study in analog 
integrated circuit design, and hence far beyond the scope of this book. We will leave

it to say that adding the resistor increases the current in the output stage of the op 
amp, and this increases the speed of that stage, making it less likely that the feed-
back signal will return late, and possibly in phase, creating an undesired oscillation. 
If you read the datasheet carefully, you will see that it speciﬁcally mentions that 
adding the pull-up resistor can help cure oscillations when driving heavy capacitive 
loads, so you didn’t necessarily need a graduate degree to think of this.
Our old friend, the non-inverting ampliﬁer, is used to increase the signal level com-
ing from the LM35D. This helps on several fronts. First, larger signals are easier to 
work with. Second, the offsets of the ampliﬁers are of the same order as the low end 
of the signal, so gaining the signal up makes these appear relatively smaller. How-
ever, you should choose the resistors so that the maximum signal does not exceed 
2.5V - the common mode range limit. Finally, you will see that the integrator does

not go all the way down to zero, and this limits the effect of this missing part of the 
scale.
The last ampliﬁer is just used as a simple comparator. This signals when the ampli-
ﬁed sensor output no longer exceeds the integrator output.
To use this circuit, you will have to set the Stamp output high for a time long 
enough to integrate all the way down. (Extra time won’t do any harm.) Then you set 
the output low, causing the integrator output to ramp up. Timing how long it takes 
for the comparator output to trip will be a measure of the temperature. Of course, 
you will have to calibrate this appropriately to get temperature in standard units.
What is a Relay, and How Do I Drive It?
Now that we have ﬁgured out how to measure temperature, we need a way of con-
trolling the pumps. The pumps are designed to run off of 12V supplies, and draw a 
couple of amps. Obviously, this is not directly compatible with the output drive 
capabilities of the Stamp, which is limited to 25mA at 5V. Worse yet, these loads 
look inductive, with frequent voltage spikes. We will want to be very careful about 
how we approach this problem.
Rather than drive the pumps directly, we will use relays to isolate the pump circuits 
from the Stamp circuits. Relays are mechanical switches which are actuated via 
electromagnets. Relays and switches are described by the number of poles and the 
number of throws. A single pole, single throw (SPST) switch is a simple switch. A 
single pole, double throw (SPDT) switch connects a common contact alternately to 
a normally closed contact and a normally open contact. The common conﬁgura-
tions are diagrammed below.

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
107
What is a Relay, and How Do I Drive It?
You should have two 5V, double pole, double throw (DPDT) relays. Frequently, the 
tops of the relays are imprinted with the connection diagram. Otherwise, you will 
need to look at the datasheet. You should conﬁrm that the relay contacts can handle 
the currents and voltages required by the pumps. Assuming you can ﬁgure out how 
to wire these as simple on/off switches, this reduces the problem to driving the 
relays from the Stamp. 
Although your relays are meant to be driven from a 5V supply, they are likely to 
require about 100mA to function. (If your relays require substantially more current 
than this, you should obtain ones with a higher coil resistance.) This is a lot closer 
to the Stamp’s drive capability, but is still too high. You will need some type of 
ampliﬁer. You should have a DS2003 seven channel, high current/voltage Darling-
ton driver chip. It falls into the category of peripheral driver chips. This IC contains 
seven individual power ampliﬁers which can each drive 350mA loads - more than 
sufﬁcient to drive the relays. Once again, we ask that you carefully examine the 
datasheet for this part.
Using the DS2003 is not difﬁcult, but requires some explanation. There are seven 
inputs, and these are compatible with your Stamp outputs. That part could not be 
easier. Pin 8 is a ground connection, and that’s pretty simple too. The outputs are a 
little trickier. Effectively, they are switches to ground. Setting the input to a channel 
high allows current to ﬂow into the output to ground. (That may sound odd, but 
that’s what happens.) So if you are going to drive a relay, one end gets connected to 
5V, and the other gets connected to a channel output.
Finally, there is the matter of pin 9, labelled common. There is a diode from each 
output to this common pin, which should be connected to the positive supply. Why? 
At ﬁrst glance, this may not make much sense. The direction the diode is pointed 
means that current can only ﬂow when the output is higher than the supply. Does 
this ever happen?
The short answer is generally no. However, if the load is an inductor, suddenly turn-
ing off the current ﬂow will cause a large voltage spike (V=Ldi/dt!) which could 
drive the output much higher than the positive rail, and potentially fry the driving 
transistors inside the DS2003. In this case, these free-wheeling diodes turn on, and 
give the current someplace to go, minimizing the voltage spike. Circuits meant to 
suppress the voltage spike which occurs when turning off the current ﬂow in an 
inductor are called snubber circuits.

How Do I make Noise?
Now that you know how to drive a relay, driving a speaker is not much more difﬁ-
cult. A speaker is usually an electromagnet which pushes a magnet in and out 
against a cone, generating sound pressure waves. Not unlike the relay, it also looks 
like an inductive load, and can be effectively driven by the DS2003.
Hopefully, you have a small 8Ω speaker. You may connect this to the Stamp via the 
DS2003 just like the relays. However, you may wish to add a small series resistance 
to make the tones a little less obnoxiously loud. On the Stamp side, there are special 
instructions for generating tones. Examine the freqout command in your Stamp 
documentation.
Many small speakers today are actually piezoelectric. If you happen to have one of 
these, you can directly drive it from a Stamp output. There are also piezoelectric 
buzzers which contain internal oscillator circuits. These are easier to use, however, 
you don’t get to change the frequency of the sound.
What Algorithm Do I Use to Control the Pumps?
You now have all of the pieces, but putting them all together to make an effective 
system can be challenging. There is a great deal of room for creativity here, but we 
will provide some general hints as to how to proceed.
The key loop in you program should turn on the hot and cold water pumps for some 
amount of time. There are two factors to consider: keeping the temperature correct, 
and keeping the level in the mixing chamber correct. The temperature will be most 
affected by the ratio of hot water to cold water. The level will be most affected by 
the percentage of time the pumps are operating. We suggest you keep these two 
things as separate as possible in your program. For example, to change the temper-
ature you should change the amount of time running the hot water pump versus run-
ning the cold water pump - not the total amount of pump running time.

In this chapter, we touched on circuits that used energy storage elements in a more 
complex fashion than an RC circuit. In the next chapter, we will expand upon this 
greatly, showing that we can use our old friend, Ohm’s Law, to quickly solve cir-
cuits containing multiple inductors and capacitors using the concept of complex 
impedance.

Clap On...
The Problem
In science ﬁction movies, you will often see people conversing with their appli-
ances. Commands such as “Lights on!” or “Screen off!” cause the appropriate 
actions to occur. Wouldn’t it be cool to build a system using your Stamp which rec-
ognized spoken commands, and performed actions accordingly? 
Unfortunately, it’s not going to happen. The sad truth is that speaker independent, 
continuous speech recognition is a really hard problem, and requires far more com-
putational horsepower than is available with the Stamp. However, we could try to 
do something far easier - recognize a simple pattern of sound.
Your goal for this chapter is to create a system which toggles the state of a relay in 
response to clapping your hands twice in rapid succession. (You may have noticed 
similar devices advertised on television.) You should endeavor to make this sound 
sensitive switch as selective as possible: i.e. it should only respond to the appropri-
ate pattern of claps, and not to other noises.

What You Need to Know
Here are some things you need to know:
• How do I detect sound?
• How do linear systems respond to sinusoids?
• How do I generalize Ohm’s Law?
• How do I detect a clap?
 How Do I Detect Sound?
What we perceive as sound is simply rapid variations in air pressure. Microphones 
or mics for short, are devices speciﬁcally designed to detect these pressure ﬂuctua-
tions, and produce a proportional electrical signal. Typically, they respond only to 
changes in pressure - not absolute pressure.
There are many types of microphones. Most have some type of ﬂexible diaphragm 
which moves in response to the pressure changes. In carbon mics, the diaphragm 
presses up against loosely packed carbon granules, changing the resistance accord-
ing to the pressure variations. Moving-coil mics are essentially speakers run back-
wards - a diaphragm is connected to a coil which moves back and forth in a 
magnetic ﬁeld producing a proportional voltage. Piezoelectric mics couple the dia-
phragm to a crystal, which generates a voltage in response to changes in stress. 
Condenser mics use the moving diaphragm as one side of a sound responsive 
capacitor. Electret mics are a type of condenser mic where a permanently polarized 
material is used for the ﬁxed plate, keeping a charge on the varying capacitor. Typi-
cally, piezoelectric and electret mics contain a small built in ampliﬁer.
We presume that you will be using an electret microphone. As always, read the data 
sheet carefully. There are two common conﬁgurations for these sort of mics - three 
lead and two lead. For most three lead devices, there is a positive supply lead, a 
ground and a signal output. For two lead devices there is only a ground and a signal 
output. However, the device still needs power, and this is usually provided by a 
pull-up resistor between the positive supply and the signal output. For either type of 
device, the output signal is meant to be capacitively coupled to an external ampli-
ﬁer. A typical schematic for a two lead device is shown below.

Clap On...
112
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
What does it mean to be capacitively coupled? If you were to examine the signals in 
this circuit with a scope, you would see that the output of the electret mic (taken at 
the bottom of the 2.2kΩ pull-up resistor) moves around in response to sound, as 
does Vout. However, the electret output bounces around some positive voltage (typi-
cally a volt or two) while Vout bounces around zero volts!
In a previous chapter, we noted that in response to a transient, a capacitor initially 
looked like a short, but after a long time, looked like an open. If we consider a sine 
wave applied to a capacitor, you might imagine that if the voltage was moving very 
quickly (i.e. a high frequency), then the cap would look like a short. For very slow 
signals (i.e. low frequency), things are hardly moving, so you would expect the cap 
to look like an open. This is pretty much what happens.
The output of the electret consists of the audio signal, sitting on top of a constant 
DC voltage. To this DC voltage, the capacitor looks like an open circuit, and it has 
no effect on the output. On the other hand, to the fast moving audio signal, the cap 
looks like a short, and this signal appears as Vout. The coupling capacitor has given 
us a way to pass only the varying part of the signal, and to block the DC, or station-
ary part of the signal.
This all begs an interesting question: if the cap looks like a short to high frequencies 
and an open to low frequencies, when does it switch over? To answer this question, 
we will have to explore AC circuit theory in a bit more depth, and ﬁgure out what 
frequency response and ﬁltering are all about.

How Do Linear Systems Respond to Sinusoids?
How Do Linear Systems Respond to Sinusoids?
Circuits consisting of ideal resistors, capacitors and inductors are linear circuits. 
Recall that linearity implies that if you were to add up the responses to a number of 
different inputs that would give the same result as the response if all the inputs were 
summed together and applied at once.
As we have already seen, sinusoidal signals naturally arise in many practical situa-
tions. So we ask, what happens if you apply a sinusoidal signal to a linear system? 
(We’ll assume that you’ve been applying this signal forever, so we are looking for 
some sort of steady-state response.) The remarkable answer is that all the currents 
and voltages in the circuit will also be sinusoidal at the same frequency as the input, 
but possibly with different phases and amplitudes!
Why might this be so? Consider a sinusoid of the form:
Using the all-but-forgotten trig identities, we realize that this can be rewritten as:
Examining this equation, we realize that a sinusoid with some phase and amplitude 
can be thought of as the sum of a sin and cosine at the same frequency, but usually 
different amplitudes determined by the phase. Letting θ range from 0 to 90º 
smoothly changes the equation from being all cosine to all sine. The upshot is that 
any sum of a sine and cosine at the same frequency results in a sinusoid with some 
generally different amplitude and phase, but at the same frequency.
Taking this a step further, you can show that summing any two sinusoids at the 
same frequency will sum to another sinusoid at that same frequency. That’s because 
each sinusoid can be broken down into its sine and cosine parts, and summing the 
sine or cosine parts results in a sine or cosine of some amplitude with everything at 
the same frequency. This is just another sinusoid, at the same frequency. Mathemat-
ically, this is:

A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
which is easily recognized as another sine wave at the same frequency, but with dif-
ferent amplitude and phase.
Ultimately, this explains why linear systems respond to a sinusoidal input with 
sinusoids at the same frequency, but with varying amplitudes and phases. Since all 
that linear systems do is sum linearly, every operation ends up with another sinu-
soid at the same frequency. Therefore, the response of any linear system to a sinu-
soid at a given frequency can be characterized by just two parameters: the gain 
(which is the ratio of the new amplitude to the old amplitude) and the phase shift 
(which is how much the phase has changed).
We can take this even further. If we supply to a linear circuit an input consisting of 
two sinusoids at different frequencies, the output can be described as the sum of 
two new sinusoids at the same frequencies as the input sinusoids. This reasoning 
can be extended to any number of sinusoids.
We won’t prove it here, but it can be shown that any waveform can be modeled as 
the sum of some number of sine waves. (Unfortunately, the number required for a 
nearly perfect model can be inﬁnite, but that’s mathematics for you.) The result is 
that if you can predict the behavior of a linear system to sine waves at all frequen-
cies, then you can predict the behavior to any input - not just sinusoids!
How Do I Generalize Ohm’s Law?
Sinusoids are so important to understanding linear systems that electrical engineers 
have devised a very clever scheme for representing them. The basic idea comes 
from Euler’s theorem:
where j is the square root of negative one. (Unfortunately, “i” was already the sym-
bol for current, so EEs use “j”.)

How Do I Generalize Ohm’s Law?
Consider the equation:
the real part of this expression is a sinusoid with some amplitude, A, and some 
phase, θ. This can also be written in the form:
Here we have separated out the phase term, ejθ.
The idea is to use complex numbers to represent sinusoids. In particular, we will 
represent amplitude as the magnitude of a complex number, and phase as the angle 
of that complex number. To obtain the actual real signal, we just need to look at the 
real part of our result.
Let’s apply this idea to a capacitor. The deﬁning equation for a capacitor is:
Applying a sinusoidal voltage gives:
The current has the same frequency, but the phase leads the input voltage by 90º, 
and the amplitude is dependent on the radian frequency, ω.
Alternatively, using complex numbers, we have:

which is identical to the previous result.
The neat thing about the complex number representation is that it lets us make a 
simple generalization to Ohm’s Law to allow for capacitors. Rather than talking 
about the resistance of a capacitor, we talk about its impedance, which we will 
denote with the letter Z, rather than R. This will be a complex number which in one 
fell swoop, relates the voltage and the current in terms of amplitude and phase at a 
given frequency.
Speciﬁcally:
The term, jω comes up so often, that we often abbreviate it with the symbol s. (Why 
s? If you study linear systems further, you will see how this is all intimately related 
to Laplace transforms.) So the impedance of a capacitor is 1/Cs.
Is this really useful? Absolutely! Consider the circuit shown below:
We can solve this circuit just as if the capacitor were a resistor of value Z. This is 
then quickly recognized as a voltage divider, giving:

How Do I Generalize Ohm’s Law?
To remove the imaginary part from denominator, we multiply top and bottom by the 
conjugate.
Finishing this up yields:
This is a complex looking expression, but it is possible to get a reasonable under-
standing out of it by looking at the limits. For very low frequencies, this reduces to:
This agrees with our earlier statement that the cap looks like an open to low fre-
quencies, making the output follow the input.
At very high frequencies, the expression becomes:
This says that at high frequencies, Vout is now 90º out of phase with the input, and 
dropping rapidly in magnitude with increasing frequency. If the input frequency is 
high enough, the output will be essentially zero, agreeing with our observation that 
caps at very high frequencies look like shorts. Circuits like this, which pass low fre-
quencies but attenuate high frequencies are called low-pass ﬁlters.
At what frequency does this ﬁlter switch from passing signals to not passing them? 
That’s not really a fair question. In fact, it does not suddenly switch - it is a gradual 
transition. However, when the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts of the 
denominator are equal, we are least able to make our approximations. This occurs 
at ω = 1/RC. At this frequency, the sine and cosine parts are equal, which gives a 
phase shift of 45º. If you work through the math, you’ll ﬁnd that the amplitude is 
down by a factor of 1/√2.

We can now plot a rough graph of the frequency response of this circuit - i.e. its 
gain and phase as a function of frequency. Typically, this is plotted on log-log 
paper, and is called a Bode plot. The sketch appears below.
Note that gain is speciﬁed in decibels, which is deﬁned by the equation:
which is really a unitless quantity.
Let’s consider another example. The circuit shown below has the resistor and 
capacitor ﬂipped from before.

Once again, this is really a simple voltage divider. We can immediately write the 
equation for Vout as:
This equation gives the transfer function from Vin to Vout. First, let’s get the imagi-
nary part out of the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate.
We can directly get at the magnitude and phase response of this circuit from this 
equation. The magnitude of a complex number is the square root of the number 
times its conjugate. So the gain is:
This is a high-pass ﬁlter. At low frequencies, the gain is very small. At high fre-
quencies, it is roughly unity (or 0dB). Again, the most ambiguous point is where ω 
= 1/RC. This is the -3dB point. 
The phase will just be the angle of the transfer function. This is given by:
Before leaving this section, we should mention that an inductor has an impedance 
of sL. So you now have all the tools you need to solve for the steady state response 
of any linear circuit to sinusoidal input.

How Do I Detect a Clap?
Quick, sharp sounds tend to have lots of power at high frequencies. So one of the 
keys to being able to detect a clap will be the ability to detect high frequency 
sounds. Since most conversation is at a lower frequency, you would like to remove 
these sounds from consideration. The key to doing this will be the ﬁlters we dis-
cussed in the last section.
Let’s look at a block diagram for a reasonable (though far from ideal) clap-activated 
switch.
The microphone converts acoustic energy into electrical signals. In addition to the 
amp in the microphone, an external amp will be needed to get reasonable signal lev-
els. The next step is a high-pass ﬁlter, to remove unwanted noises, such as conversa-
tion. A precision rectiﬁer then removes the negative parts of the signal. This is so 
the following low-pass ﬁlter can average only the positive peaks to get a measure of 
the amplitude of the high frequency components of the signal. Finally, this is com-
pared to a reference level. Any loud, high frequency sound will cause the compara-
tor to trip, which can be detected by the Stamp. The pot provides a sensitivity 
adjustment to change the reference level for the comparator.
The detailed schematic is fairly complicated, and is shown below. A major issue 
you will have to confront right away is the problem of running off of a single 5V 
supply. To deal with this, an op amp is dedicated to creating a false ground approx-
imately 1 volt above ground. This will give the op amps some room to swing both 
negative and positive with respect to our false ground.
The ampliﬁer is a basic noninverting gain stage. We would suggest you start with a 
gain of approximately 100. This should get you up to a reasonable signal level. Be 
sure to examine the signals on a scope.
A simple high-pass ﬁlter attenuates low-frequencies. You will have to determine 
reasonable values for the resistor and the capacitor.

What’s Next?
The precision rectiﬁer is next. When the V+ input is higher than the V- input, the 
diode is turned on, and the ampliﬁer pours its silicon heart out trying to make 
V+=V-. When V+ goes below V-, the diode turns off, the op amp output shoots to 
ground, and the rectiﬁer output is held at the false ground by the resistor.
The last piece of circuitry left to design is the ﬁnal low-pass ﬁlter. This smooths out 
the rectiﬁed waveform. If you make the time constant too small, the comparator 
output will ﬂutter up and down. If you make it too big, the response will be very 
slow. Getting the time constant right here may well be the trickiest part of the 
design.
Finally, you will need to write some software for your Stamp to recognize a double 
clap. We suggest you carefully consider, and actively look for the appropriate on 
and off times. You will be amazed how much clever software can clean up mediocre 
hardware!
What’s Next?
That’s up to you. As for this book, this is the end. We hope you enjoyed it!

The BASIC Stamp 2 
Serial Cable
Roll Your Own
Before you can make a Stamp do anything, you will need a way of connecting it to 
your development computer. While there are a number of commercial solutions, 
you can make up your own cable very easily and inexpensively. This discussion 
presumes that you have some experience with ohm meters and soldering. If you do 
not, seek out someone that does. It takes less than ten minutes to make up the cable 
once you have all the parts. I would consider this is a one-beverage level favor to 
ask a more experienced friend.

The BASIC Stamp 2 Serial Cable
124
A Pragmatic Introduction to the Art of Electrical Engineering
The Connections
Most modern PCs have a 9-pin serial port connector on the rear panel. Your goal is 
to connect pins 2, 3, 4 and 5 on that connector to pins 1-4 respectively on the Stamp 
2. In addition, you need to connect pin 6 to pin 7 on the PC serial port. This is 
explained in the Stamp documentation and is diagrammed below.
The easiest way to do this is to buy an inexpensive 9-pin serial cable, and cut off the 
far end. This should leave you with a female DB-9 connector running out to a 
bunch of wires. Here’s the hard part: You need to identify which wire goes to which 
pin. The pin numbers should be labelled on the connector, and you can use an ohm 
meter to trace out what goes where. Strip and tin the wires. Make the pin 6-7 con-
nection by twisting the wires together and soldering. Then cover with electrical 
tape. The remaining wires can be directly plugged into the solderless breadboard in 
the appropriate order. Personally, I like to write this order down directly on the 
cable, so it can’t get lost. If you want to get fancy, you could attach a 4-pin connec-
tor with 0.1” pin spacing to plug in next to the Stamp 2. Just remember to mark 
which pin goes to pin 1 on the Stamp 2.

There are quite a few parts that are needed to build all the projects in this book. To

www.stampsinclass.com, for details.
When I taught this class, the kits which were sold through the bookstore. One kit 
was required for each lab group of two people. In addition to the kits, selections of 
resistors and capacitors were made available in the lab. Since this was a project ori-

of lab.

extra kits in reserve to replace broken parts.
The Smart Shower
The Smart Shower apparatus is shown below. Hot and Cold water tanks are emptied 
via two automobile windshield wiper pumps (available at most auto supply stores). 
These ﬂow into a mixing chamber with a small hole in the bottom. There is also a 
ﬂoat switch in the mixing chamber to allow detection of the desired ﬂuid level. 
Underneath the Mixing Chamber is a Collection Tank which receives the “shower”. 
A high current automotive type power supply is available which is sufﬁcient to 
drive both pumps simultaneously. A nice touch is to bring all electrical connections
