A class of interacting classical random ﬁelds is constructed using deformed ⋆-algebras of creation
and annihilation operators. The ﬁelds constructed are classical random ﬁeld versions of “Lie ﬁelds”.
A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be
states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the ﬁelds constructed are “quantum ran-
dom ﬁelds” in the sense that they have Poincar´e invariant vacua with a ﬂuctuation scale determined
by ℏ. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle
interpretation of a quantum ﬁeld theory.

INTRODUCTION
Instead of the interacting Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
methods that require regularization and renormalization,
we will here pursue a purely algebraic approach, which
will lead to a deformation of the commutation relations
of an algebraic presentation of the generalized free clas-
sical random ﬁeld.
The classical random ﬁeld models
constructed here are based on the structure of the quan-
tum ﬁelds known as “Lie ﬁelds”[1, 2, 3, 4]. Lowenstein[2,
p. 57] points out that the examples he constructs do not
lead to scattering, which Greenberg[3] proves for quan-
tum Lie ﬁelds in general. Baumann[4] proves that Lie
ﬁelds are incompatible with the spectrum condition, but
classicality of a ⋆-algebra of observables is a diﬀerent con-
straint than microcausality and the spectrum condition,
so that we will be able to construct “classical random Lie
ﬁelds with quantum ﬂuctuations”.
A previous paper presented the classical Klein-Gordon
random ﬁeld using a creation and annihilation opera-
tor formalism, and showed that in these terms quan-
tum ﬂuctuations and thermal ﬂuctuations can be pre-
sented as Poincar´e invariant and non-Poincar´e invariant
ﬂuctuations respectively[5]. It was also shown that we
can construct a Poincar´e invariant state of the classical
Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld, with a ﬂuctuation scale de-
termined by ℏ, that produces measurement results iden-
tical to measurement results produced by the vacuum
state of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, whenever mea-
surements are made at space-like separation. When in-
compatible measurements are made at time-like separa-
tion, so that measurements aﬀect the results of subse-
quent measurements, careful attention to the diﬀerences
between quantum and classical models of measurement
is needed[6]. Classical models must explicitly model the
eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on measurement by in-
cluding the measurement apparatus in the model when-
ever the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations are empirically

signiﬁcant.
Appendix A discusses the relationship be-
tween the measurement theories of quantum ﬁelds and
of classical random ﬁelds.
Section II of this paper discusses the free Klein-Gordon
quantum ﬁeld and the free Klein-Gordon classical ran-
dom ﬁeld using a creation and annihilation operator for-
malism, then section III constructs scalar classical ran-
dom Lie ﬁelds. A vacuum vector, deﬁned as a zero eigen-
vector of all annihilation operators, is used to construct
a linear form over the algebra of creation and annihila-
tion operators. A partial proof that this linear form is a
state over the algebra is given in Appendix B, but part
of the proof remains a conjecture. In corroboration of
the conjecture, Appendix B shows that the linear form is
positive semi-deﬁnite for operators that are constructed
as sums of products of up to ﬁve annihilation operators
and ﬁve creation operators.
Section IV discusses measurement and scattering the-
ory for these Lie ﬁelds, which gives a sense in which a
particle interpretation of the formalism is the same as
a particle interpretation of a quantum ﬁeld theory, even
though as a local operator model the Lie ﬁelds we have
constructed are certainly not local quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries. Section V constructs Lie ﬁelds based on vector or
electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Statistics of observables and correlations between them
are a principle empirical foundation of modern physics.
This paper constructs a continuous range of deformations
of generalized free ﬁelds as algebraic models for those
statistics and correlations that goes beyond the range of
application of free ﬁelds.

THE FREE KLEIN-GORDON FIELD AND
THE GENERALIZED FREE FIELD
Measurement for a classical Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld can be modelled by an operator ˆφf that satisﬁes
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 for all f and g in a test function space S
on Minkowski space, which we will take to be a Schwartz
space of complex-valued functions[7, §II.1.2], so that f(x)

2
is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well as its
derivatives faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in
any direction. Although ˆφf can be presented in terms of
an operator-valued distribution ˆφ(x) as
R
d4xf(x)ˆφ(x),
we will work here mostly with operators indexed by test
functions, which gives an eﬀective and compact nota-
tion. We may construct the classical Klein-Gordon ran-
dom ﬁeld as a sum of creation and annihilation operators,
ˆφf = af + a†
f ∗[5]. The construction ˆφf = af + a†
f ∗makes
ˆφf complex linear in f, supposing that we deﬁne af to be
complex linear in f — this is essential for a Wightman
ﬁeld and mathematically very convenient, but ˆφf is an
observable only when f = f ∗is real, so that ˆφ†
f = ˆφf.
An equilibrium state of the classical Klein-Gordon ran-
dom ﬁeld at temperature T can be presented in terms
of a Euclidean invariant “vacuum” state |0⟩, for which
af |0⟩= 0, if af and a†
g satisfy the commutation relations
[af, a†
g] = (g, f)C and [af, ag] = 0. The non-Lorentz in-
variant inner product (g, f)C is given by
(g, f)C = kBT
Z
d4k
(2π)4
2πδ(kµkµ −m2)
k0
˜g∗(k) ˜f(k). (1)
This contrasts with the inner product that determines
the structure of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld,
(g, f)Q+ = ℏ
Z
d4k
(2π)4 2πδ(kµkµ −m2)θ(k0)˜g∗(k) ˜f(k),
(2)
which explicitly restricts to the forward light-cone as well
as being Lorentz invariant because of the removal of the
k0 from the denominator, resulting in the Poincar´e invari-
ant vacuum state of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld.
Given the vacuum state over the ⋆-algebra generated by
the creation and annihilation operators, we can use the
GNS construction to construct a Hilbert space HC [7,
§III.2.2].
The GNS representation of the classical un-
bounded random ﬁeld operator ˆφf acts on a dense do-
main DC ⊂HC.
In a creation and annihilation operator formalism, it
is the restriction to the forward light-cone, the spectrum
condition, that results in nontrivial commutation rela-
tions [ˆφf, ˆφg] when the supports of f and g are not at
space-like separation. We can also construct a Poincar´e
invariant state of the classical Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld, in which k0 is removed from the denominator, but
no restriction to the forward light-cone is imposed,
(g, f)QC = ℏ
2
Z
d4k
(2π)4 2πδ(kµkµ −m2)˜g∗(k) ˜f(k).
(3)
This produces measurement results that are identical to
measurement results produced by the vacuum state of the
quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, whenever measurements
are made at space-like separation. Measurements can be
made at time-like separation in this classical random ﬁeld
model, but are incompatible in a quantum ﬁeld model,
so a direct comparison of time-like separated measure-
ments is not possible. This Poincar´e invariant state does
not maximize the entropy of the Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld, so we can either introduce a classical dynamics with
the nonlocal Hamiltonian
R
d3k˜Φ∗(k)
p
|k|2 + m2 ˜Φ(k),
which has this Poincar´e invariant state as its Gibbs equi-
librium state, or else we can introduce a “Poincar´e invari-
ant entropy”, which we might call “quantum entropy”,
as the thermodynamic dual to ℏ(this is in addition to en-
tropy, which is the thermodynamic dual to temperature
— in [5] I preferred the introduction of a nonlocal dynam-
ics, but the idea of quantum, Poincar´e invariant entropy
has interesting consequences, to be developed elsewhere).
Note that on a view of the quantized Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld that is suggested by comparison with a classical ran-
dom ﬁeld, the spectrum condition has nothing to do with
“stability”, which is the reason generally given for insist-
ing on the restriction to the forward light-cone. For the
classical model presented by equation (1), it is the max-
imization of the entropy, and hence the minimization of
the classical free energy, that makes the Gibbs state sta-
ble — the classical energy of the Gibbs state is inﬁnite,
but lower temperature states are thermodynamically in-
accessible.

shell by a K¨all´en-Lehmann weight function ρ(σ),

INTERACTING CREATION AND
ANNIHILATION OPERATORS FOR A SCALAR
FIELD
We will consider here deformations of the commuta-
tion relations for creation and annihilation relations that
satisfy linearity, λaf +µag = aλf+µg. Using creation and
annihilation operators makes possible the construction of
a classical ⋆-algebra that parallels the construction of a
quantum Lie ﬁeld[2]. Linearity is a very tight constraint,
insofar as the only choice for a deformed commutation
relation is
[af, a†
g] = (g; f) + aξ(g;f) + a†
ξ(f;g),
(5)
where ξ(g; f) is test function valued and anti-linear and
linear in the test functions g and f respectively. We will
suppose that the inner product (·; ·) is Lorentz invariant,
but may be either quantum or classical in the sense of
the previous section, restricting the energy-momentum
spectrum either to the forward light-cone or to the for-
ward and backward light-cones. The only other possi-
ble linear deformation, q-deformation of the commuta-
tion relation, is ruled out because it does not allow ei-
ther microcausality or classicality to be satisﬁed, and we
will not consider here the possibility of deformed anti-
commutation relations. Non-scalar ﬁelds are constructed

3
in section V. The literature on quantum Lie ﬁelds re-
quires that [ˆφf, ˆφg] = iω(f, g) + ˆφξ(f,g), which requires
a commutation relation of the form (5) for creation and
annihilation operators. For a classical random ﬁeld, the
commutation relation [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 is trivial, so we will
deﬁne the algebraic structure of a “classical random Lie
ﬁeld” by equation (5).
We can always apply the commutation relations
(5) to convert any product of creation and annihila-
tion operators to a sum of normal-ordered products
a†
g1...a†
gmaf1...afn, so that we can construct a ⋆-algebra
that is generated by a ﬁnite but arbitrarily large set of
test functions, presuming that associativity can be en-
sured for some choice of (·; ·) and ξ(·; ·). To ensure as-
sociativity of the ⋆-algebra generated by these creation
and annihilation operators, we must ensure that the Ja-
cobi identity is satisﬁed for all elements in the algebra;
as a ﬁrst step, we must ensure that single creation and
annihilation operators satisfy the Jacobi identity,
[af, [ag, a†
h]] + [ag, [a†
h, af]] + [a†
h, [af, ag]] = 0,
(6)
which requires that
(ξ(g; h); f) = (ξ(f; h); g),
(7)
ξ(f; ξ(g; h)) = ξ(g; ξ(f; h)),
(8)
ξ(ξ(g; h); f) = ξ(ξ(f; h); g).
(9)
If we can ﬁnd functions that satisfy equations (7), (8),
and (9), then, because of the symmetries of (·; ·) and
ξ(·; ·), we can deﬁne two more general objects, which take
two lists of functions as arguments, symmetric in their
anti-linear and linear arguments separately,
ξ(ξ(f1, ..., fm; g1, ..., gn); f) = ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm, f)
ξ(g; ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm)) = ξ(g1, ..., gn, g; f1, ..., fm)
(ξ(f1, ..., fm; g1, ..., gn); f) = (g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm, f)
(g; ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm)) = (g1, ..., gn, g; f1, ..., fm).
For example,
(ξ(f1; g1); f2) = (g1; f1, f2),
ξ(ξ(f1; g1); ξ(g2, f2)) = ξ(g1, g2; f1, f2),
(ξ(f1; ξ(f3; g1)); ξ(ξ(f4; g2); f2)) = (g1, g2; f1, f2, f3, f4).
The position of each function in the ﬂattened expres-
sion depends only on whether it is linear or antilinear
in the original expression. This can be extended by lin-
earity to a sesquilinear form on the symmetrized tensor
product spaces S(S⊗n) over the test function space, for
n > 1. With this deﬁnition, we can write the product

This product of one annihilation operator with n creation
operators (which generates 3 · 2n −2 terms, in contrast
to the n + 1 terms that are generated by the same prod-
uct of undeformed annihilation and creation operators)
is symmetric in f1, ..., fn. The Jacobi identity is satisﬁed
for general basis elements of this ⋆-algebra because of the
symmetry of equation (10) in f1, ..., fn, and similar sym-
metries of higher products, so that we obtain the same
ﬁnal expression in terms of normal-ordered expressions
in the annihilation and creation operators independently
of the order in which we apply the commutation relation
(5) to move creation operators to the left and annihila-
tion operators to the right.
We will here assume that the linear form generated by
the vacuum vector, ω( ˆA) = ⟨0| ˆA |0⟩is a state over the
⋆-algebra generated by creation and annihilation opera-
tors that satisfy the commutation relation (5), as it is for
the free ﬁeld, so that ⟨0| ˆA ˆA† |0⟩≥0 for all operators in
the ⋆-algebra. Appendix B gives a partial proof and a
substantial corroboration that this is true for a classical
random Lie ﬁeld. We can straightforwardly compute the
lowest degree moments of the probability density asso-
ciated with the observable ˆφf = af + a†
f ∗, in the state
⟨0| ˆA |0⟩that is deﬁned by af |0⟩= 0,
⟨0| ˆφf |0⟩= 0

f |0⟩= (f ∗; f, f, f) + 4(f ∗, f ∗; f, f)+
(f ∗, f ∗, f ∗; f) + 3(f ∗, f)2.
(11)
The expressions for higher moments quickly become more
complex, but the cumulants of the probability density are
straightforward,
C1(f) = 0
C2(f) = (f ∗; f)
C3(f) = (f ∗; f, f) + (f ∗, f ∗; f)
C4(f) = (f ∗; f, f, f) + 4(f ∗, f ∗; f, f) + (f ∗, f ∗, f ∗; f)
C5(f) = (f ∗; f, f, f, f) + 11(f ∗, f ∗; f, f, f)+

We can also calculate n-measurement connected correla-
tion functions, obtaining for the 3- and 4-measurement
connected correlation functions, for example,
⟨0| ˆφf1 ˆφf2 ˆφf3 |0⟩c = (f ∗
3 ; f2, f1) + (f ∗
3 , f ∗
2 ; f1)
⟨0| ˆφf1 ˆφf2 ˆφf3 ˆφf4 |0⟩c = (f ∗
4 ; f3, f2, f1) + 3(f ∗
4 , f ∗
3 ; f2, f1)+
(f ∗
4 , f ∗
2 ; f3, f1) + (f ∗
4 , f ∗
3 , f ∗
2 ; f1).
As an aside, the n-measurement connected correlated
functions do not vanish at any order, so the condi-
tions for the proof of Greenberg and Licht for Wightman
theories[9], that there is no scattering if the truncated
functions vanish beyond some order, are not satisﬁed.
To ﬁnd a space-time model for (·; ·) : S × S →IR and
ξ(·; ·) : S × S →S, we will use the following momentum
space expressions,
(g; f) =
Z
d4uM(u)˜g∗(u) ˜f(u),
(13)
˜ξ(g; f)(s) =
Z
d4ud4vM(u)˜g∗(u) ˜f(v)δ(s + u −v)F(s, u)
=
Z
d4uM(u)˜g∗(u) ˜f(u + s)F(s, u),
(14)
where we will consider cases in which the mass function
M(u) may be quantum (non-zero only on and within the
forward light-cone) or classical (non-zero on and within
both the forward and backward light-cones). The delta
function δ(s + u −v) immediately ensures translation in-
variance, for which we must have (gx; fx) = (g; f) and
ξx(gx; fx) = ξ(g; f), where gx(y) = g(y −x). Equation
(7) then requires that
(f; ξ(g; h)) =
Z
d4uM(u) ˜f ∗(u)˜ξ(g, h)(u)
=
Z
d4ud4vM(u) ˜f ∗(u)M(v)˜g∗(v)˜h(u + v)F(u, v)
(15)
must be equal to (g; ξ(f; h)), which is satisﬁed if F(u, v) = F(v, u) is symmetric under permutation of u, v for almost
all u, v. Equation (8) requires that
˜ξ(f; ξ(g; h))(s) =
Z
d4uM(u) ˜f ∗(u)˜ξ(g, h)(s + u)F(s, u)
=
Z
d4ud4vM(u) ˜f ∗(u)M(v)˜g∗(v)˜h(s + u + v)F(s + u, v)F(s, u)
(16)
must be equal to ˜ξ(g; ξ(f; h))(s), which is satisﬁed if
F(s + u, v)F(s, u) = F(s + v, u)F(s, v)
(17)
is symmetric under permutation of u, v for almost all u, v. Finally, equation (9) requires that
˜ξ(ξ(g; h); f)(s) =
Z
d4uM(u)˜ξ∗(g, h)(u) ˜f(s + u)F(s, u)
=
Z
d4ud4v˜g(v)˜h∗(u + v) ˜f(s + u)F ∗(u, v)F(s, u)M(u)M(v)
=
Z
d4ud4v′˜g(v′ + s) ˜f(u + s)˜h∗(u + v′ + s)F ∗(u, v′ + s)F(s, u)M(u)M(v′ + s)
(18)

5
must be equal to ˜ξ(ξ(f; h); g)(s), which is satisﬁed if
F ∗(u, v′ + s)F(s, u)M(u)M(v′ + s) = F ∗(v′, u + s)F(s, v′)M(v′)M(u + s)
(19)
is symmetric under permutation of u, v′ for almost all
u, v′. These three symmetries can be solved, provided
F(s, u) and M(u) are almost always non-zero, by multi-
plying equation (19) by F ∗(s, u) and using equation (17)
and the symmetry F(s, u) = F(u, s), so that we obtain
|F(s, u)|2M(u)
M(u + s)
= |F(s, v)|2M(v)
M(v + s)
,
(20)
which, taking into account again the symmetry F(s, u) =
F(u, s), requires
|F(s, u)|2 = λ2 M(u + s)
M(u)M(s).
(21)
With this solution, equations (13) and (14) become
(g; f) =
Z
d4u ˜g∗(u) ˜G∗(u) ˜G(u) ˜f(u),
(22)
˜ξ(g; f)(s) = λ

˜G∗(u) ˜G(u + s)
˜G(s)
˜f(u + s),
(23)
where | ˜G(u)|2 = M(u). Using the above, we can con-
struct the sesquilinear forms (...; ...) and ξ(...; ...),
(g1, ..., gm; f1, ..., fn) = λm+n−2

The restriction that M(u) ̸= 0 almost everywhere is not
empirically signiﬁcant, insofar as M(u) may be arbitrar-
ily close to zero, but also note that (...; ...) does not re-
quire the inverse of the mass function at all. ξ(...; ...) does
not appear in the ﬁnal expressions for expected values of
observables, except implicitly as part of the construction
of (...; ...), so for all observables we can comfortably take
the limit in which M(u) →0 outside the light-cone. For
the classical random ﬁeld we will construct, we can mod-
ify the algebra so that we may take M(u) = 0 on any
Lorentz-invariant set, in particular so that M(u) = 0 for
every space-like u, without having to take limits (see Eq.
(32)). For the deformed commutation algebra to exist,
note that | ˜G(u)|2 = M(u), so M(u) cannot be restricted
to a single mass shell as a distribution, we must take as a
starting point a generalized free ﬁeld that has a K¨all´en-
Lehmann weight function of which we can legitimately
take a square root.
Having constructed the associative ⋆-algebra above, we
must now consider the possibility of microcausality or
classicality for the observables ˆφf = af +a†
f ∗, [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0
either for functions that have space-like separated sup-
ports or for all functions, respectively.

will be zero whenever
(g∗; f) = (f ∗; g) and ξ(g∗; f) = ξ(f ∗; g)
(27)
are both symmetric in f and g. The ﬁrst condition is sat-
isﬁed for a generalized free quantum ﬁeld, when f and g
have space-like separated supports. The ﬁrst condition is
also satisﬁed for a generalized free classical random ﬁeld,
for all test functions f and g. The symmetry condition
ξ(g∗; f) = ξ(f ∗; g) can be satisﬁed for test functions f
and g, noting that eg∗(u) = ˜g∗(−u),

˜G(u) = G0(uµuµ)eiG1(uµuµ)(θ(u0)−θ(−u0)),
for
arbi-
trary real functions G0
and for all real functions
G1 that are zero for space-like uµ.
The classical
sesquilinear
form
(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm)
is
equal
to
(g1, ..., gn−1; g∗
n, f1, ..., fm), etc., so we can write this as
(; g∗
1, ..., g∗
n, f1, ..., fm), and similarly ξ(g1..., gn; f1, ..., fm)
can
be
rewritten
as
ξ(g1, ..., gn−1; g∗

etc.,
so
the
n-measurement

correlation
function
⟨0| ˆφf1 · · · ˆφfn |0⟩c
reduces
for
n

1
to
(n −1)!(; f1, ..., fn); for n = 1, ⟨0| ˆφf1 |0⟩= 0. Deﬁning
a notation
˜f(גu) =
˜G(u) ˜f(u), of which the inverse
Fourier transform f(גy) can be constructed because
f(x), as a Schwartz space function, is well-behaved,
then (; f1, ..., fn) can be straightforwardly evaluated in
real-space as
(; f1, ..., fn) = λn−2(2π)4(n−1)

so the n-measurement connected vacuum correlation
function is a measure of the “overlap” of the Lorentz-
invariantly G-modiﬁed smearing functions fג

2, ..., fג

For example,
(; f1, f2, f3) = λ

We can also compactly express ξ;(גf1, ..., fn) as a real-
space product,
ξ;(גf1, ..., fn)(y) = λn−1(2π)4(n−1)fג

n(y), (31)
which, however, is probably best regarded purely as an
intermediary in calculations, insofar as it introduces an
equivalent of virtual particles in this formalism; in gen-
eral, Eq. (31) does not imply the existence of a function
ξ(; f1, ..., fn), if M(u) = 0 for some values of u. In terms
of G-modiﬁed functions, we can write equation (5) as

MEASUREMENT AND SCATTERING
For non-vacuum states, expressions for the classical n-
measurement connected correlation functions can be cal-
culated easily enough, but do not as easily simplify. For
the state |g⟩=
ˆφg
√
(g;g) |0⟩, for example, for ˆφf, ˆφ2
f, and
ˆφ3
f, we have
⟨g| ˆφf |g⟩
= 2(g; g, f)
(g; g)
,
⟨g| ˆφ2
f |g⟩c = (; f, f) + 6(g; g, f, f) + 2(g; f)(; g, f)
(g; g)
−4(g; g, f)2
(g; g)2
,
⟨g| ˆφ3
f |g⟩c = 2(; f, f, f) + 6(g; f)(; g, f, f) + 6(; g, f)(g; f, f) + 24(g; g, f, f, f)
(g; g)
−12(g; g, f)(g; f)(; g, f) + 36(g; g, f)(g; g, f, f)
(g; g)2
+ 16(g; g, f)3
(g; g)3
.
(33)
A candidate form of causality for classical Lie ﬁelds is to
require that states such as the above use only functions
that have positive spectrum in their construction. If we

7
could also apply this spectrum restriction to measure-
ment operators, we would eﬀectively recover the spec-
trum condition of Wightman ﬁelds, since G(u) always
occurs together with test functions in (...; ...). Local ﬁeld
operators cannot be required to satisfy this restriction,
however, because it is incompatible with reality, ˆφ†
f = ˆφf,
which requires f = f ∗.
Eigenvectors of space-time translations of the above
⋆-algebra can be constructed in a similar way to those of
free quantum ﬁelds. We translate a state by translating
the creation operators that were used to construct the
state, so we introduce a derivation on the ⋆-algebra,
h
∂α, a†
g∗
y
i
= a†
∂g∗y
∂yα
,
∂α |0⟩= 0,
(34)
where gy(x) = g(x −y) is a space-time translation of the
test function g. We abbreviate this notation by assuming
that all test functions are indexed by a space-time trans-
lation vector yα, which we then omit. The ⋆-algebra of
observables deﬁned by equation (5) and extended by ∂α
satisﬁes the Jacobi identity. As in the free quantum ﬁeld
case, the (improper, inﬁnite norm) 1-particle eigenvec-
tors of ∂α are a†
g∗
k |0⟩, where gk(x) = eikαxα. We can also
construct a†
g∗
k1 a†
g∗
k2 · · · a†
g∗
kn |0⟩as eigenvectors (which are
also improper and inﬁnite norm) of ∂α. The candidate
form of causality suggested above also ensures that the
Hilbert space generated by positive spectrum test func-
tions satisﬁes the spectrum condition.
We are now in a position to consider analogues of scat-
tering theory in this formalism. Scattering theory in the
usual sense of “in” and “out” ﬁelds is not possible, be-
cause this paper has adopted, in philosophers’ terms, a
block world formalism for models, in which a state that
models (or, if we prefer, approximately describes) the
world is given for all time (which is why we used active
translation instead of state evolution to construct the
operator ∂α in the previous paragraph). The 1-particle
eigenvector a†
g∗
k |0⟩is problematic to deal with because it
does not have ﬁnite norm, so we will use a function gS
that has bounded support in a region S of momentum
space, instead of gk, together with an improper measure-
ment operator ˆφfk, where ˜fk(u) = 1
2(δ(u−k)+δ(u+k)).
For these functions, the 1-measurement correlation func-
tion is
⟨gS| ˆφfk |gS⟩= 2(gS; gS, f)
(gS; gS)
,
= 2λ
R
δ(u1 −v1 −v2)d4u1 ˜G∗(u1)˜g∗
S(u1)d4v1 ˜G(v1)˜gS(v1)d4v2 ˜G(v2) ˜fk(v2)
R
δ(u1 −v1)d4u1 ˜G∗(u1)˜g∗
S(u1)d4v1 ˜G(v1)˜gS(v1)
= | ˜G(k)|2 ξ(gS; gS)(−k) + ξ(gS; gS)(k)
(gS; gS)
.
(35)
When k is a time-like 4-vector such that there is a u for
which u and u + k are both contained in the bounded
momentum-space region S, there is in general a non-zero
expectation for the observable ˆφfk. As we tune S to be
smaller and smaller, so that a†
g∗
S |0⟩approaches a pure
momentum state, there is non-zero expectation for ˆφfk
only for very small k.
A diﬀerent approach, which introduces nonlocal “parti-
cle” measurements, is to consider probabilities expressed
as inner products such as
⟨fS| gS1
2
⟨fS| fS⟩

gS1
 gS1
 =
|(fS; gS1)|2
(fS; fS)(gS1; gS1),
⟨fS| gS1, gS2
2
⟨fS| fS⟩

gS1, gS2
 gS1, gS2
 =
|(fS; gS1, gS2)|2
(fS; fS)

(gS1; gS1)(gS2; gS2) + (gS1; gS2)(gS2; gS1) + 3(gS1, gS2; gS1, gS2)
,
(36)
where fS, gS1, and gS2 have bounded supports S, S1,
and S2 in momentum space.
These can be under-
stood as probabilities that (with normalization implicit)
states prepared as
gS1

and as
gS1, gS2

will, on mea-
surement, “look like” |fS⟩. These probabilities will be
non-zero, respectively, if S ∩S1 ̸= ∅(just as for a

8
free ﬁeld), or if S ∩(S1⋄+S2) ̸= ∅, where S1⋄+S2 =
{k : k = k1 + k2; k1 ∈S1, k2 ∈S2}.
It is useful to un-
dertake a Gram–schmidt orthogonalization of the state
|g1, g2⟩= a†
g∗
1 a†
g∗
2 |0⟩relative to the 1-particle states |f⟩=
a†
f ∗|0⟩, which gives what can more-or-less properly be
called a 2-particle state,
|g1, g2⟩2 = |g1, g2⟩−|ξ(; g1, g2)⟩
=

a†
g∗
S1 a†
g∗
2 −a†
ξ∗(;g1,g2)

|0⟩,
(37)
for which ⟨f| g1, g2⟩2 = 0 for all functions f, so that
there is zero probability that |g1, g2⟩2 will “look like” a
1-particle state. On the basis of this Gram-Schmidt or-
thogonalization, |g1, g2⟩should be understood to be a su-
perposition of a 1-particle state and a 2-particle state. If
an experiment prepares a state that looks sometimes like
a 1-particle state and sometimes like a 2-particle state,
then the state should be modelled either as a superpo-
sition or as a mixture of 1- and 2-particle states. Note
that if g1 and g2 are improper restrictions to pure mo-
menta k1 and k2, then both components of |g1, g2⟩2 are
(k1+k2)α eigenstates of ∂α. For 3-particle states that are
orthogonal to both 1-particle and 2-particle states, and
for 4-particle states that are orthogonal to 1-, 2-, and
3-particle states, we have
|g1, g2, g3⟩3 = |g1, g2, g3⟩−|g1, ξ(; g2, g3)⟩2 −|g2, ξ(; g3, g1)⟩2 −|g3, ξ(; g1, g2)⟩2 −|ξ(; g1, g2, g3)⟩

If we consider the inner product between two 2-particle states,

(40)
we ﬁnd that there is a non-zero probability of

2 if S3 ∩S1 ̸= ∅and S4 ∩S2 ̸= ∅,
or if S4 ∩S1 ̸= ∅and S3 ∩S2 ̸= ∅, which corre-
spond to no interaction between the two particles, or if
(S3⋄+S4) ∩(S1⋄+S2) ̸= ∅, which corresponds to an energy-
momentum conserving interaction between two particles,
with the precise probabilities of observing a particular
pair of particles instead of a diﬀerent pair being deter-
mined by the function ˜G(u).
Whereas the improper free ﬁeld vectors |K1, K2⟩and
|L1, L2⟩are orthogonal if the wave numbers K1 and
K2 are not a permutation of L1 and L2, we see from
equation (40) that the classical random Lie ﬁeld vec-
tors |K1, K2⟩2 and |L1, L2⟩2 are orthogonal only if, as
well, K1 + K2 ̸= L1 + L2.
We can represent the in-
ner product 2⟨K1, K2| L1, L2⟩2 graphically as

Similarly, referring to equation (B5), |K1, K2, K3⟩3 and
|L1, L2, L3⟩3 are orthogonal if the wave numbers K1,
K2, and K3 are not a permutation of L1, L2, and
L3, there are no permutations σ, τ ∈S3 that result in
Kσ(1) + Kσ(2) = Lτ(1) + Lτ(2) and Kσ(3) = Lτ(3), and
K1 + K2 + K3 ̸= L1 + L2 + L3, which we can represent

and in general every partition of n contributes terms to
n⟨K1, ..., Kn| L1, ..., Ln⟩n.
The 4-dimensional block world context leads to signif-
icant diﬀerences from a conventional scattering theory,
nonetheless measurement operators such as |fS⟩⟨fS| and
gS1, gS2

2 2

gS1, gS2
 generate a nonlocal, noncommuta-
tive ⋆-algebra that looks moderately familiar as a particle
model. If we restrict to positive frequency test functions
in this nonlocal “particle” approach to measurement, we
obtain a formalism that is a quantum ﬁeld theory, inso-
far as both state preparation and measurement use only
positive frequency test functions. We cannot construct a
⋆-algebra of local observables that has non-trivially mi-
crocausal commutation relations, but classical commuta-
tion relations between local ﬁeld observables are possi-
ble. An algebra of nonlocal “particle” observables such
as |fS⟩⟨fS| is in principle non-observable and rather dif-
ferent from the commutative algebra generated by the lo-
cal ﬁeld observables ˆφf, with f in the Schwartz function
space, but particle observables are usable as an approxi-
mation.
An interesting mathematical problem is the extension
of the above construction to limiting expressions which
introduce inﬁnite products of the ﬁeld, such as the char-
acteristic function ⟨0| eiλˆφf |0⟩, which we can write for-
mally as exp
P∞

, but with obvious wor-

9
ries about convergence. Although all correlation func-
tions of ﬁnite degree are ﬁnite (which costs such eﬀort to
achieve in conventional perturbation theory), ξ(; f ×n) is
a product of test functions in real space, which is not in
the Schwartz space for an inﬁnite product of test func-
tions. The correlation functions of ﬁnite degree are in
principle the empirically veriﬁable content of the theory,
however, so it seems easier to discount this mathematical
problem than to discount the mathematical problem of
renormalization.

LIE FIELDS BASED ON VECTOR AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
The dynamics of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld
in terms of a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on test
functions is given by Menikoﬀand Sharp[10, equation
(3.27)] (except for a missing factor of (2π)−3 that is
present in their equation (3.25)):

(41)
Note that E and F are not electromagnetic ﬁeld ten-
sors, they are bivectors of classical test functions that
contribute to a description of measurement and/or state
preparation of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld.
If
the fourier transform
˜Fµν(u) of a test function F
has electric and magnetic ﬁeld components (˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3)
and (˜b1,˜b2,˜b3), the integrand for the inner product
(F; F)EM at (u0, 0, 0, u0) is the positive semi-deﬁnite
form u2

quantum ﬂuctuations, in which we remove the restriction

Fαβ is the
Hodge dual of the test function Fαβ. In the vector case,
At(u) and As(u) determine the independent amplitudes
of ﬂuctuations of, respectively, time-like and space-like
components of the vector ﬁeld, and At(u) = As(u) = 0
when uαuα ≤0; in the bivector case, B(u) and Bd(u)
determine the independent amplitudes of ﬂuctuations of
two sets of Hodge dual components of the bivector ﬁeld,
and B(u) = Bd(u) = 0 when uαuα < 0.
For the construction of interacting creation and annihi-
lation operators satisfying equation (5) as a deformation
of a free classical vector or bivector random ﬁeld, we have
to be able to construct generalized linear forms (...; ...)
and ξ(...; ...) that are symmetric in their anti-linear and
linear parameters respectively, and more generally that
satisfy equations (7)–(9) and (27), which preclude any
simple construction of ξ(...; ...) using contraction directly.
We will therefore introduce a pair of Lorentz covariant
sets of algebraic operators qα† and qα, satisfying the com-
mutation relation [qα, qβ†] = gαβ, and a pair of vectors
|0q⟩and
0′

= 0 (the
ﬁrst of which yields +gµν at an appropriate point, the
second of which yields −gµν). With this deﬁnition, the
operators Qα = qα + qα† = Qα† generate a commuta-
tive algebra, [Qα, Qβ] = 0, so that we can contract test
functions with Qα, then use ⟨0q| · · · |0q⟩to construct an
inner product. For (U; V )V and the electromagnetic half

the vector and bivector indices, except when we consider

symmetrized contraction, but an algebraic construction
emphasizes that the algebraic and combinatoric struc-
tures of scalar, vector, and bivector ﬁelds are identical,
up to the ﬁnal step of evaluating inner products and
terms such as (; F1, F2, F3, F4) as space-time integrals.
The introduction of the algebra generated by Qα eﬀec-
tively extends the test function space to the symmetrized
tensor algebra of the tangent space over space-time,
since we have implicitly introduced operators such as

for us to take the extended test function space to be

APPENDIX A: MEASUREMENT THEORY FOR
QUANTUM FIELDS AND FOR CLASSICAL
RANDOM FIELDS
Conventionally, quantum mechanics models a set of
measurements in an idealized way as an incompatible set
of operators acting on a single state in a Hilbert space,
which represents a measured system, but for more de-
tailed models the measurement apparatus must be in-
cluded.
For example, in Feynman and Hibbs, “The
usual separation of observer and observed which is now
needed in analyzing measurements in quantum mechan-
ics should not really be necessary, or at least should
be even more thoroughly analyzed.
What seems to be
needed is the statistical mechanics of amplifying appa-
ratus”[11, pp.
22-23].
More forcefully, Bell urges us
to describe experiments instead of speaking of measure-
ments of systems[12].
Once preparation and measure-
ment apparatuses are included in a detailed model of an
experiment, the diﬀerence between quantum ﬁeld mod-
els and classical random ﬁeld models for experiments be-
comes nominal and empirically irrelevant. What must
be particularly ensured, however, is that the statistical
mechanics of amplifying apparatus includes the eﬀects
of quantum ﬂuctuations, either implicitly in a quantum
measurement model or explicitly in a classical measure-
ment model, whenever considering the eﬀects of quantum
ﬂuctuations is necessary to ensure empirical adequacy of
a model.
It should be noted that classical random ﬁelds are suﬃ-
ciently similar to quantum ﬁelds and suﬃciently diﬀerent
from classical particle property models that the assump-
tions that are needed to derive Bell inequalities are gen-
erally not satisﬁed if there are any thermal or quantum
ﬂuctuations[13].
It is a curiosity of the measurement theory of quantum
ﬁelds that modelling experiments using measurement op-
erators places measurement apparatuses and the Physi-
cist outside of space and time, and supposes that the use
of diﬀerent measurement apparatuses in principle does
not change the physical state of any preparation appa-
ratus (that is included in the model) or of the measured
system whatsoever. In contrast, if we include the mea-
surement apparatus in a quantum ﬁeld model, the pres-
ence of the measurement apparatus certainly changes the
measured system – the past of the measurement appara-
tus is in the past light-cone of the measured system. In-
compatibility of measurement operators can be thought
of loosely as describing the non-trivial eﬀects of measure-
ments on each other, while curiously requiring the mea-
sured state in principle not to be diﬀerent when we make
the diﬀerent measurements.
To determine a quantum
state, however, we have to make incompatible measure-
ments of the same prepared state. This is perfectly ac-
ceptable as a pragmatic approach to measurement, but,
as a result, moving the Heisenberg cut changes the rela-
tionship between measurement apparatus and measured
system, so that the measured system either is or is not
changed by the presence of the measurement apparatus.
If we consider classical random ﬁelds in terms of mea-
surement, then they have their own, equally pragmatic
assumption about measurement: that we can make mea-
surements that eﬀectively do not change the measured
system. This assumption is violated quite strongly when
we attempt, for example, to describe electromagnetic
ﬁelds in the quantum mechanical regime as classical sys-
tems, insofar as from a classical point of view the mea-
surement apparatus does change the measured system.
Instead of considering classical random ﬁelds in terms of
measurement, however, it is conceptually more straight-
forward to think of classical random ﬁelds as allowing us
to construct models, or descriptions, of experiments. The
models we construct are idealized to a greater or lesser
extent, depending on how much care is needed to achieve
suﬃcient empirical accuracy. If quantum ﬂuctuations are
empirically signiﬁcant, which they are when we describe
experiments that are in the quantum mechanical regime
using classical random ﬁelds, we have to include in the
model the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations of all interact-
ing parts of the experiment. In practice, this presumably
never includes the person who is watching a computer
display of experimental results, but it often will require
us to take account of the eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations
on interactions between measurement apparatus and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, “the statistical mechanics of am-

11
plifying apparatus”.
In reverting to a classical random ﬁeld model that ex-
plicitly includes experimental apparatuses and the eﬀects
of quantum ﬂuctuations as well as the eﬀects of ther-
mal ﬂuctuations in models, we treat thermal and quan-
tum ﬂuctuations in a more even-handed way. If we un-
derstand the Unruh eﬀect to describe transformations
between quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations under non-
inertial changes of coordinates, the principle of equiva-
lence and a preference for covariant presentation of phys-
ical models suggest that we ought to prefer classical ran-
dom ﬁeld models to quantum ﬁeld models. Making the
expressions given in this paper for (...; ...) and ξ(...; ...)
generally covariant and independent of or determining
the underlying geometry, however, is a nontrivial prob-
lem.
One situation in which quantum ﬂuctuations are phys-
ically signiﬁcant but not necessarily a signiﬁcant part of
measurement, so that classical random ﬁeld models might
be as eﬀective as quantum ﬁeld models, is in solid state
physics, insofar as quantum ﬂuctuations are important
to the internal structure of a material but measurement
apparatuses measure thermodynamical properties with-
out quantum ﬂuctuations of the measurement apparatus
signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the microstructure of the material.
It also seems that with the addition of detailed consid-
eration of the quantum ﬂuctuations of light sources, de-
tectors, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we might reason-
ably expect to expand the scope of semi-classical optics,
which is already empirically adequate for a wide range of
experiments. It is always a contingent question whether
a detailed model of sources and detectors is necessary
to model a whole experiment with suﬃcient empirical
adequacy, whether we model experiments in terms of
a quantum mechanical or a classical model of measure-
ment. The advantage of a quantum mechanical model of
measurement is of course that it is often not necessary to
model measurement apparatuses explicitly, where a clas-
sical model of measurement for the same experiments
may require detailed explicit models of quantum ﬂuctu-
ations.
APPENDIX B: THE VACUUM STATE OF THE
CLASSICAL RANDOM LIE FIELD
To show that ⟨0| A |0⟩is a state over the classical ran-
dom Lie ﬁeld ⋆-algebra, we have to show that ⟨0| AA† |0⟩
is positive semi-deﬁnite for operators A constructed only
from annihilation operators. For a classical random Lie
ﬁeld, the multilinear form ξ(; f1, f2, ..., fn) can be deﬁned
to be ξ(f ∗
1 ; f2, ..., fn), which we can use to construct the
orthogonal states |g1, g2⟩2, |g1, g2, g3⟩3, and |g1, g2, g3, g4⟩4
of equations (37), (38), and (39). Computer algebra ver-
iﬁes fairly straightforwardly that these states, and the
similarly deﬁned state |g1, g2, g3, g4, g5⟩5, are mutually or-
thogonal for all choices of functions, with inner product
a sum over partitions of n and twice over permutations
in Sn,
m⟨f1, ..., fm| g1, ..., gn⟩n = δm,n
X
π
M2(π)
n!
X
σ∈Sn
X
τ∈Sn
Pπ(fσ(1), ...fσ(n); gτ(1), ..., gτ(n))
(B1)
where M2(π) = n!/1a1a1! 2a2a2! ...nanan! (with ak the number of times that k appears in the partition π, see
[14, (p823, p831)]), and P(a1,a2,...,an)(f1, ...fn; g1, ..., gn) constructs a term with P ak factors, each of the form
(fj, ..., fj+k−1; gj, ..., gj+k−1); for example,
P(2,1)(f1, f2, f3, f4; g1, g2, g3, g4) = (f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3, f4; g3, g4),
(B2)
where (2, 1) is an unambiguous abbreviation of (2, 1, 0, 0).
A veriﬁcation that Eq. (B1) is correct for the ﬁrst ﬁve of
the states |g1, ..., gn⟩is of course not a proof, which I can-
not currently provide, however the very straightforward
algebraic and combinatorial structure strongly suggests
that it is a correct conjecture for all m, n. Including mul-
tiplicity, n⟨f1, ..., fm| g1, ..., gn⟩n generates n!2 terms, in
contrast to n! terms for the free ﬁeld (which correspond
to the partition (n) in equation (B1)). Computer algebra
beyond 5⟨f1, f2, f3, f4, f5| g1, g2, g3, g4, g5⟩5 requires more
computing resources than I have available (more eﬃcient
programming would probably extend my limit to 6, but
the improvement would only be cosmetic). The ﬁrst ﬁve
inner products are:
⟨f1| g1⟩= (f1; g1),
(B3)

12
2⟨f1, f2| g1, g2⟩2 = (f1; g1)(f2; g2) + (f2; g1)(f1; g2) + 2(f1, f2; g1, g2),
(B4)
3⟨f1, f2, f3| g1, g2, g3⟩3 = (f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3; g3) + (f1; g1)(f3; g2)(f2; g3) + (f2; g2)(f1; g3)(f3; g1)+
(f2; g1)(f1; g2)(f3; g3) + (f2; g1)(f1; g3)(f3; g2) + (f1; g2)(f2; g3)(f3; g1)+
2(f1; g1)(f2, f3; g2, g3) + 2(f1; g2)(f2, f3; g1, g3) + 2(f1; g3)(f2, f3; g1, g2)+
2(f2; g1)(f1, f3; g2, g3) + 2(f2; g2)(f1, f3; g1, g3) + 2(f2; g3)(f1, f3; g1, g2)+
2(f3; g1)(f1, f2; g2, g3) + 2(f3; g2)(f1, f2; g1, g3) + 2(f3; g3)(f1, f2; g1, g2)+
12(f1, f2, f3; g1, g2, g3),
(B5)
4⟨f1, f2, f3, f4| g1, g2, g3, g4⟩4 = (f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3; g3)(f4; g4) + ...
(24 terms)
+ 2(f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3, f4; g3, g4) + ...
(72 terms)
+ 4(f1, f2; g1, g2)(f3, f4; g3, g4) + ...
(18 terms)
+ 12(f1; g1)(f2, f3, f4; g2, g3, g4) + ...
(16 terms)
+ 144(f1, f2, f3, f4; g1, g2, g3, g4),
(B6)
5⟨f1, f2, f3, f4, f5| g1, g2, g3, g4, g5⟩5 = (f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3; g3)(f4; g4)(f5; g5) + ...
(120 terms)
+ 2(f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3; g3)(f4, f5; g4, g5) + ...
(600 terms)
+ 4(f1; g1)(f2, f3; g2, g3)(f4, f5; g4, g5) + ...
(450 terms)
+ 12(f1; g1)(f2; g2)(f3, f4, f5; g3, g4, g5) + ...
(200 terms)

(100 terms)
+ 144(f1; g1)(f2, f3, f4, f5; g2, g3, g4, g5) + ...
(25 terms)
+ 2880(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5; g1, g2, g3, g4, g5).
(B7)
The number of permutations associated with each partition is M1(π)M3(π), where
M1(π) = n!/(1!)a1 (2!)a2 ... (n!)an,
M3(π) = n!/(1!)a1a1! (2!)a2a2! ... (n!)anan!.
(B8)
We will show that the sum over permutations,
Sπ(f1, ..., fn; g1, ..., gn) =
X
σ∈Sn
X
τ∈Sn
Pπ(fσ(1), ...fσ(n); gτ(1), ..., gτ(n))
(B9)
is an inner product for each partition independently.
Equation (B4) is the sum of the free ﬁeld inner prod-
uct (the Permanent of a Gram matrix (fi, gj), which is
well-known to be an inner product over a symmetrized
tensor product space[15, §2.2]) and 2(f1, f2; g1, g2), which
is also clearly an inner product. In equation (B5), the
ﬁrst six terms are the free ﬁeld inner product, and the
last term is again clearly an inner product. The terms
(f1; g1)(f2, f3; g2, g3), ... can be written as a trace of two
matrices, Tr

M(f, g)N(f, g)T
, where Mij = (fi; gj),
Nij = (Fi; Gj); F1 = (f2, f3), etc.
M and N are
both Gram matrices, so the trace Tr

M(f, f)N(f, f)T 
is
positive semi-deﬁnite for any decomposable symmetrized
tensor f1 ⊗f2 ⊗f3, hence 3⟨f1, f2, f3| g1, g2, g3⟩3 is also
an inner product over the symmetrized tensor product
space. More generally, proceeding by induction,
X
σ∈Sn
X
τ∈Sn
(fσ(1); gτ(1))Pπ1(fσ(2), ..., fσ(n); gτ(2), ..., gτ(n))
(B10)
is Tr

M(f, g)Nπ1(f, g)T 
, where π1 is a partition of
n −1 and Nπ1(f, g) is a Gram matrix of n vec-
tors (f1, ..., ×
fj, ..., fn) and n vectors (g1, ..., ×
gj, ..., gn) us-
ing Sπ1, which, on the induction hypothesis, is an
inner product.
With the same construction, using
(fσ(1), fσ(2); gτ(1), gτ(2)) etc. instead of (fσ(1); gτ(1)), we
can conﬁrm by induction that Sπ is an inner product for
each partition of n, and hence that ⟨0| A |0⟩is a state
over the classical random Lie ﬁeld.
