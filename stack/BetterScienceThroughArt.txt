This is a sort of contemporary science which is more easily 
understood than the nonsensical poem.
Don’t you think? Ah, but with training this is quite easily 
understood. The poem, however—obviously no amount of 
training, teaching, or learning will bring you to understand it.
Some other examples: a visual representation of a source 
code svn log shows, clearly, the history of the program, where­
as the Jackson Pollock painting is clearly less understandable
Some mathematicians have computed the fractal dimen­
sion of some of Pollock’s drip paintings as high as 1.72—
thickly layered and complex.

Prefrontal lightningbolt too lazy to chew the sphinx’s loudest eyelash
Not even if it shushes you with a mast of sneers
Down which grateful bankvault-doors scamper
Because of a doublejointedness that glows in the dark

Numbed by beaks of headless measuringtape
So the lubriciousness can tower in peace

Art is strange. Art cannot be understood. The poet Rob­
ert Browning is reported to have said of a passage he wrote:
When I wrote that, God and I knew what it meant, 
but now God alone knows.
Science and art don’t seem directly related. Except people 
do science. And people do art. Science is a clear statement of 
truth in the actual world. Behold the simplicity of science:

Other representations of source code are more prosaic, 
and tell the story of a human mind at work using human 
hands—and sometimes we wonder whether writing code out 
by hand would help a programmer better understand what 
he or she is doing. Some human designs seem a bit sloppy, or 
even pieced together, but still we can see the human mind at 
work even through the mess and erasures. 
The work below by Sanda Illescu is based on a recursive 
writing / erasing / rewriting process in which a poem by Wal­
lace Stevens is written, erased, and then the same poem with 
one fewer line is written again; the process halts when only 
one line—the first line—remains. A surrounding recursion 
produces a total of 24 pieces like this where the first is the 
most heavily written and erased and the last is the least. This 
is the 13th in the sequence.
kjs, working with Sanda, captured the formal structure of 
her process as a Java program. Around this formal structure, 
however, Sanda engaged in a non-deterministic, human pro­
cess of noticing and responding to the situation in ways that 
are human and resistant to easy expression in algorithmic 
form—finding a new interpretation of the poem through re­
peated reading and writing; seeing and then responding to 
imperfections in the paper.
Art is, in part, the practice of intense and disciplined notic­
ing—of details, of life, of how the world works—and in that 
way at least it resembles science.
Many artists use processes or formal techniques to increase 
the opportunities for noticing—artists don’t simply visit their 
cafés every day, do their laundry, and put their (very interest­
ing) cats in their art. Some of those techniques include types 
of sampling, stochastic or otherwise.

For many, science appears in caricature—science is a pro­
cess and a way of thinking; individuals practice that process 
and way of thinking to perfection, the result being a steady 
progression of increased and perfected knowledge over the 
millennia—the forward march of science. In this carica­
ture, scientists
• 
create knowledge
• 
study the world as it is
• 
are trained in the scientific method
• 
use explicit knowledge
• 
are thinkers
In fact, this is not the case. Not only is it not clear what 
science really is and how it’s practiced, but in terms of purely 
being right, science is one of the most failure-prone of disci­
plines, with theories being overturned and subsumed all the 
time. Aristotelian science overturned by Newton subsumed

by Einstein, Ptolemy overturned by Copernicus, Lamarck1 
by Darwin. And on and on.
Along with that caricature is a companion for engineering. 
Engineering, it’s thought, is only the application of science, 
and with that is a belief—perhaps not deeply held but at least 
a first approximation—that science always precedes engineer­
ing, and that without science there could be no engineering.
Important in thinking about art, science, and engineering 
are the ideas of explicit and tacit knowledge. 
Explicit knowledge is something that can be written down 
and is thereby fully and accurately transmitted. Here is an 
example:
Los Angeles is east of Reno.
For some this is be new information, and perhaps it re­
quires some verification, but once you have read, understood, 
and believed this sentence, you know it as well as anyone.
Tacit knowledge depends on practice and, to an extent, 
skill. Knowing how to design, for example, requires tacit 
knowledge.
Artists are thought to use an educated sense of aesthetics 
to work effectively. Artists typically have a highly trained skill 
or talent, such as the ability to draw, paint, sculpt, write, or 
compose music. In this caricature, artists
• 
create artifacts
• 
study the world as it appears
• 
are trained in a creational skill
• 
use aesthetics and tacit knowledge
• 
are doers or expressers
1Lamarck turns out not to be so overturned as we thought—c.f. epigenetics.
When viewed according to these caricatures, art, engi­
neering, and science appear to be very different disciplines 
requiring different abilities, skills, likes, desires, and motives.
t
Science is a complicated beast. People who study how sci­
ence works cannot agree on what they see. What follows is 
a quick tour of the landscape, each the view of a respected 
philosopher of science.
Demarcation problem: the study of what science is focuses 
on the question of what separates scientific ideas, statements, 
and theories from pseudoscience—or voodoo, if you will. This 
is called the demarcation problem. 
Further, the demarcation problem includes finding out 
how “science” determines whether one theory is “better” 
than another, thereby invoking a scientific revolution in the 
Kuhnian sense [7].
Positivism has been the dominant “theory” of science for 
many centuries, and particularly so in the 20th and 21st cen­
turies. In fact, some consider it the current received theory.2 
Positivism is “the view that serious scientific inquiry should 
not search for ultimate causes deriving from some outside 
source but must confine itself to the study of relations exist­
ing between facts which are directly accessible to observation” 
[8]. It rejects any appeal to metaphysics. Positivism states 
that we understand the world by looking at it—that reality 
is real, and that our sense perceptions are valid. This holds 
even when our perception is through mechanisms we create, 
such as scientific instruments.
Logical positivism adds the idea that rational or logical 
conclusions from observations and other scientific knowledge 
are also valid statements about the world.
Elitist authoritarianism: science proceeds by scientific 
publication. What counts as science is what’s published in 
those conferences and journals that are labeled “scientific.” 
Such publication is based on the opinions of a jury of 
peers—peer review. Such juries are not elected or randomly 
selected but are chosen by program chairs and editors in chief, 
and so represent a kind of scientific in group, an inner circle. 
Inductivism tackles the problem of how to establish uni­
versal statements given a finite and limited set of observations. 
It permits many similar observations to add up to a general 
statement about the universe. Inductivism is how we come 
to believe that a series of observations on or near Earth lead 
to valid scientific theories about the other side of the galaxy, 
other galaxies, and in fact, the other side of the universe.
Inductivism is based on two difficult requirements; first, 
that it is possible to bridge the gap from facts to factual prop­
ositions, and second, that it’s possible to go from a finite set 
of observations to a universal law. It would be a statement of 
metaphysics to claim that our neighborhood of the universe 
2Some form of positivism has been a recurrent theme since the early Greeks 
until today.

Even in the 20th century, many if not most physicists viewed 
quantum mechanics as a good predictive theory and not 
necessarily a statement about what is true in the universe.
Falsifiability is considered by many to the be primary 
characteristic of a scientific statement. If a statement can be 
falsified, it is scientific. Because an experiment can be an ob­
servation, there are many statements that are scientific that 
we might not think of that way.
2 + 2 = 3 is a scientific statement that happens to be false 
(by observation and elementary-school arithmetic).
This sentence no verb is similarly scientific, and true.
More importantly, there are two questions that make 
things problematic. The first is that if you need to construct 
an instrument as part of an experiment to verify a statement, 
and that instrument and understanding of what it measures 
depend on the theory being tested, then why should we be­
lieve that the instrument is capable of falsifying the theory? 
There needs to be a separate theory of how the instrument 
works and what it measures—but this can be a convention­
alist theory in practice.
The other is that if a theory is well-established and an ex­
periment falsifies the theory, how seriously should we take the 
refutation? In some cases the experimental data is thrown out. 
If it persists, usually the theory is patched to account for the 
discrepancy. And sometimes a deep analysis is undertaken 
to determine whether some variables are disturbing the re­
sults (the ceteris paribus or “all things being equal” situation).
Imre Lakatos tried to reconcile Popper’s rational falsifi­
cationism with Thomas Kuhn’s historical view of science in 
his take on research programmes. 
Research Programmes: Lakatos claimed that science was 
performed in the form of a research programme in which a 
hard core of the theory was protected from direct patching 
by a cocoon of auxiliary hypotheses that could be modified 
to handle experimental discrepancies. Research programmes 
contain methodological statements that tell scientists what 
is good to work on and what isn’t. 
In this view, what many think of as a single theory is re­
ally a series of slightly different theories, where a later theory 
differs from its predecessor by being better or progressive. A 
theory is progressive (over the last) when it leads to new pre­
dictions, none of its bold (core) predictions have been falsified, 
and it is not patched by ad hoc statements, but instead retains 
its hard core and adjusts its protective belt. A series of theories 
like this is called a research programme, and when a research 
programme is no longer progressive, a new one emerges.
Popper required instances of nature saying NO be ex­
plained or the theory replaced; Kuhn observed “normal sci­
ence” moving forward patching its theory until it was too 
unwieldy, and then replacing it during a sort of revolution. 
Epistemological anarchism (anything goes): Paul Fey­
erabend—in some ways rpg’s favorite philosopher of sci­
is special, with laws that enable the existence of cognitive be­
ings, for example. But to claim that our neighborhood is not 
special is science, according to inductivism.
These two requirements are impossible according to phi­
losophers from previous centuries, and their reasoning is 
interesting wrt our exploration of what science is. The first 
requirement falters because a person is needed as the bridge 
between facts and propositions—to judge what is relevant 
and what isn’t, and aesthetics can intervene.
The second requirement suffers an interesting critique as 
well. Aristotelian logic is about syllogisms, and for centuries 
it was considered the only valid form of logic, and especially 
of deduction. In the 17th century—when science as we know 
it was born—scientists noticed that all the interesting logical 
derivations used some non-Aristotelian method of inference. 
Many of these derivations were relational, such as if B and 
C are between A and O, and G is between B and C, then G 
is between A and O. Because Aristotle and his ideas about 
logic were held in such high regard, this led scientists to con­
clude that the validity of a logical inference depended on the 
scientist’s intuition, which meant logic was a psychological 
question. In fact, many scientists believed that an inference 
was valid exactly when a sane person felt it was valid. More­
over, with so many types of inference being possible, it turned 
out that there was reason to believe in content-increasing in­
ferences, and hence inductivism was born, and as we’ll see, 
content-increasing inferences are at the heart of doing science.
Probabilism is a brand of inductivism. Scientific state­
ments are ones that can be shown to be probable, and one 
theory is better than another if it is more probable. Voodoo 
is not scientific because its probability is low—or because 
other theories are more probable.
The size of the universe and the small sample we have of it 
naturally mean that the probabilities behind our theories—if 
they would ever be actually computed—are small.
Conventionalism ducks the whole question of what’s true 
in order to get at what’s useful. In a sense, conventionalism 
takes engineering more seriously than it does truth, and posits 
that science is about coming up with mechanisms that make 
engineering calculations easy—and perhaps elegant. Con­
ventionalism is one of the oldest takes on science. The very 
first “theory” was Ptolemy’s system of spheres within spheres, 
which enabled him to predict very accurately the movement 
of planets and other heavenly bodies against earth’s night sky. 
All this while maintaining that the earth was (or could be) 
at the center of the universe. Copernicus came along with a 
more accurate and simpler theory, but he failed to realize that 
he could protect himself against the anger of the Church by 
explaining that of course the views implied by his “theory” 
weren’t true—contrary as they seemed to be to the Bible—but 
his theory was merely a way to simplify astronomical (and 
astrological) calculations.

can be easily applied. These stories are in a computationally 
friendly language called mathematics.
Skilled manual labor entails a systematic encoun­
ter with the material world, precisely the kind of en­
counter that gives rise to natural science. From its ear­
liest practice, craft knowledge has entailed knowledge 
of the “ways” of one’s materials—that is, knowledge 
of their nature, acquired through disciplined per­
ception....[I]n areas of well-developed craft practices, 
technological developments typically preceded and 
gave rise to advances in scientific understanding, not 
vice versa. [11]
One good example is the steam engine. It was developed 
while scientists were way into the caloric theory of heat. 
Looked at now, this theory is hilarious. It held that heat con­
sisted of a fluid called caloric that flows from hotter to colder 
bodies. Caloric is a weightless gas that can pass in and out of 
pores in solids and liquids. 
The amount of caloric in the universe is constant, so there 
is a sort of conservation that thermodynamics also recognizes. 
A cup of hot coffee cools because caloric is self-repelling, 
so it disperses from the dense concentration in the cup to 
the less dense air.
When caloric enters the air, it combines with its molecules, 
and thus the air increases in volume. By expanding on what 
happens when caloric interacts with other matter we can 
explain heat radiation, phase changes (ice, water, steam, for 
example), as well as deduce most of the gas laws.
When Laplace corrected Newton’s pulse equation with a 
constant to take caloric into account, the equation was better 
able to predict the speed of sound, and as this constant was 
refined under the caloric theory, even more precise predic­
tions for the speed of sound were made for over a century.
The caloric theory was replaced, generally, by thermody­
namics, but you know, the whole time steam engines contin­
ued to work, and they still do.3
Here is a more realistic view of scientists and engineers. 
Both scientists and engineers create knowledge through dis­

was due mostly to a lack of knowledge (scientific or engineering) about the 
strengths of materials.
ence—said that science really doesn’t proceed in a rational 
manner, that there is no such thing as demarcation between 
science and voodoo, that there is no such thing as progress, 
and that one theory succeeds another only when the propa­
ganda machine of the replacing theory’s proponents over­
throws the other’s.
Actor Network Theory: Bruno Latour looks at science with 
a sociologist’s eye [10]. He argues three ideas: science is what 
a jury decides it is; science is what gets done in a laboratory; 
accepted science is the result of a strong social network in 
which references accumulate to indicate what the overall com­
munity of scientists thinks about the work. In other words, 
to know what science is, visit Google Scholar.
These views teach us that science is not purely about the 
truth, scientists aren’t (simply) objectively securing the truth 
from the clutches of nature, and science might after all sim­
ply be a convenient story about the world that enables us to 
build things.
And what of the idea that engineering depends on science? 
Here is how the American Engineers’ Council for Professional 
Development defines engineering:
The creative application of scientific principles to 
design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, 
or manufacturing processes.…
t 
Let’s look at engineering to start to connect art with sci­
ence through engineering.
rpg: In 1995 I went back to school and got my MFA in Cre­
ative Writing—in poetry in fact. They tried to teach me how to 
notice things. In fact, the primary method of teaching fine arts 
is to show you how to observe and analyze closely so you can 
learn and improve on your own. If all you have for a teacher, 
for example, is a complicated poem written by a master, you 
must be able to see all the craft elements and thought processes 
the poet used to create that poem.
We think of engineers as craftsmen or sometimes even 
as laborers. But building things—as engineers do—requires 
people to manipulate materials and the physical world, and 
figuring out how to build things requires looking at the world 
very carefully. Therefore, engineers need tacit knowledge to 
do their work well. And tacit knowledge comes from practice 
and discipline, and being able to notice deeply—as artists do.
It shouldn’t be surprising then to notice, when we look 
back on the history of science, that many or perhaps most of 
our scientific advances came from engineers, builders, and 
craftsmen working with materials, coming to understand 
them, and formalizing their characteristics. 
What science contributes, mainly, is a way of thinking 
about materials and forces in ways that are computationally 
convenient and repeatable, in ways that reveal the properties 
and possibilities of nature. Science is a story with lessons that

covery, are problem driven, and seek to understand and ex­
plain the world and things in it. Scientists design hypotheses 
and experiments, and engineers design devices—in fact, en­
gineers help scientists design the devices used in their ex­
periments. Scientists are more comfortable with abstract or 
universal ideas, and engineers with concrete or contingent 
knowledge.4 And both rely on tacit knowledge.
t
What’s the essence of science? Discovery and verification.
Verification is mostly what the philosophers of science 
concern themselves with, but without discovery, there is not 
so much to verify. Discovery is the heart scientific inquiry. 
Engineering, as we’ve seen, is one way discoveries happen—
from playing with materials, trying to bend them to our wills, 
using them to build with—and another way is simple notic­
ing what’s in front of you.
Langley, Simon, Bradshaw, and Zythow—Herb Simon—
noticed similar things when writing about a system they 
wrote that engages in data-driven scientific discovery:
In the scientist’s house are many mansions… .Out­
siders often regard science as a sober enterprise, but 
we who are inside see it as the most romantic of all 
callings. Both views are right. The romance adheres 
to the processes of scientific discovery, the sobriety to 
the responsibility for verification.
…
Histories of science put the spotlight on discovery....
The story of scientific progress reaches its periodic cli­
maxes at the moments of discovery....In the philoso­
phy of science, all the emphasis is on verification, on 
how we can tell the true gold of scientific law from 
the fool’s gold of untested fantasy. In fact, it is still 
the majority view among philosophers of science that 
only verification is a proper subject of inquiry, that 
nothing of philosophical interest can be said about 
the process of discovery.
…
But we believe that science is also poetry, and—per­
haps even more heretical—that discovery has its rea­
sons, as poetry does. However romantic and heroic we 
find the moment of discovery, we cannot believe either 
that the events leading up to that moment are entirely 
random and chaotic or that they require genius that 
can be understood only by congenial minds. We be­
lieve that finding order in the world must itself be a 
process impregnated with purpose and reason. [12]
Artists discover—they notice; it’s what they’re trained to 
do. It requires some talent to become an artist, but mainly it 
4Contingent knowledge is knowledge that depends on the context or envi­
ronment where one is working.
takes practice and perseverance. Genius is rarely if ever part 
of the equation.5
But a step has been left out: exploration. Think of art. Dis­
covery is the heart of any artistic endeavor. Discovering is 
noticing, and noticing naturally takes place on a journey, 
preferably a strange one. Artists often start out with no par­
ticular destination in mind when they start a project, and 
sometimes—this will be hard to believe at first—no starting 
point but simply what happens to occur to them at the start. 
Noticing is trained seeing, and not only what is there but 
what should be there. 
And not just in art. Think of science. First exploration 
(Darwin on the Beagle), then discovery (Röntgen and X-rays), 
and finally understanding (Maxwell’s equations).
Ordinary folks don’t see as scientists or artists do. George 
Gamow et al. saw (predicted) that there should be a cosmic 
microwave background radiation (CMBR) left over from the 
big bang. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson didn’t ignore the 
low-level background signal from their radio telescope but 
worked hard to eliminate all possible explanations except 
CMBR.6 It turned out that what they were “seeing” was what 
had been “seen” (predicted) earlier. One does well to know 
what might be seen, and to know how to recognize it. Art­
ists similarly know how to see. Painters and photographers 
see color differently from someone not trained as an artist.
Exploration is essential to artists—so essential that some 
artists use artificial mechanisms to ensure that the starting 
place and subject matter are substantially random and un­
planned for in order to explore fruitfully. Artists have found 
it can be important to have a sort of defocused attention and 
to engage in flat associations—going broad not deep. This is 
exploration; by noticing we begin to discover. Discovery is 
making connections, and this is where metaphors pop up. 
Peter Turchi writes that exploration is “some combination 
of premeditated searching and undisciplined, perhaps only 
partly conscious, rambling,” and that “if we persist, we dis­
cover” [13].
Exploration is opening the mind to possibilities; discovery 
can be literal discovery, such as finding a pot of gold at the 
end of a rainbow, but sometimes it’s a guess—this is the best 
way to structure the story, the best image to convey the nar­
rative or lyrical point, or the best explanation of what you saw 
while exploring; understanding is coming to believe (based 
on real evidence) that the discovery or guess is valid—that it 
is right, that it is what is needed, and perhaps why it’s valid.
Turchi says, “exploration is assertive action in the face of 
uncertain assumptions, often involving false starts, missteps, 
5C.f., e.g., The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle, The Genius in All of Us by Da­
vid Shenk, and Multiple Authorship and the Myth of Solitary Genius by 
Jack Stillinger.
6Wikipedia reports on their scientific assiduousness: “After thoroughly 
checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna, 
and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained.”

and surprises” [13]. Discovery, as William Stafford might 
say, is a “reckless encounter with whatever comes along” [14].
Some writers start with a scene or a situation, sometimes 
just a sense or feeling—and that becomes a novel. The poet 
Bob Hass says he starts with a phrase, a word, or a line and 
a gesture, a physical gesture in the air which indicates, for 
example, a rising energy level or a decline or some more com­
plicated shape—and the result is a poem [15].
Once a draft begins to take shape—a draft of a written 
piece or paint on the canvas or some shards off the rock or 
some notes on the guitar—a process of understanding begins. 
This is the revision process where what has been discovered 
is examined and the best story / painting / sculpture / com­
position is created. Sometimes these drafts are in the form 
of sketches or studies when the medium is not malleable. 
Again, Turchi: “Only after discovery can the work be prop­
erly structured, can the selection and organization of the 
significant moments of time take place” [13]. He continues:
If we attempt to map the world of a story before 
we explore it, we are likely either to (a) prematurely 
limit our exploration, so as to reduce the amount of 
material we need to consider, or (b) explore at length 
but, recognizing the impossibility of taking note of 
everything, and having no sound basis for choosing 
what to include, arbitrarily omit entire realms of in­
formation. The opportunities are overwhelming. [13]
This is the full process of art—exploration, discovery, and 
then verification or understanding—and it’s also the full pro­
cess of science. Naturally, it’s not a linear process but one with 
cycles of explore-discover-understand within any of its steps.
What’s different between art and science is the emphasis 
given to the parts. Serious thinkers about the scientific process 
focus on verification and understanding. Making judgments 
about what’s good science. What’s nice about art is that there 
has been plenty of thought given to the early parts of the pro­
cess: exploration and discovery—and we can learn from it.
Artistic creation is as much about being lost as exploring 
known—even half-known—territory. Great explorers don’t 
explore the parts of the map that have names. Turchi sums 
it up like this:
Artistic creation is a voyage into the unknown. In 
our own eyes, we are off the map. The excitement of 
potential discovery is accompanied by anxiety, de­
spair, caution, perhaps, perhaps boldness, and, al­
ways, the risk of failure. Failure can take the form 
of our becoming hopelessly lost, or pointlessly lost, 
or not finding what we came for (though that last is 
sometimes happily accompanied by the discovery of 
something we didn’t anticipate, couldn’t even imagine 
before we found it). We strike out for what we believe 
to be uncharted waters, only to find ourselves sailing 
in someone else’s bathtub. Those are the days it seems 
there is nothing new to discover but the limitations of 
our own experience and understanding. [13]
Art and science can be confused: at the beginning of re­
corded history there were a set of stories about how and why 
the world and people were created, why weather happens, why 
the earth moves under our feet, why the seasons change, why 
people are different, why their moods change, why there are 
families, how to plant, hunt, and live. Oceans, sky, fire, trees, 
animals. Matt Crawford writes:
Some of the oldest stories we know, including cre­
ation myths, were attempts to make sense of the world. 
Those early storytellers invented answers to the mys­
teries all around them. Why does the rain come? 
Why does it stop? If a child is created by two adults, 
from where did the first two adults originate? What 
is the earth like beyond what we have seen, and be­
yond what the people we know have seen? What lies 
beyond the stars? [11]
We call these stories literature now, or religious tracts. But 
at the time, they passed as science.
Looking at art objectively, given this more enlightened 
view, it seems that artists, engineers, and scientists are not 
so different after all. 
They all create knowledge of one sort or another—some­
times “hard science” knowledge, sometimes “how to” knowl­
edge, and sometimes “what about it” knowledge. Artists cre­
ate language and other sorts of realities (like engineers). They 
work through the medium of the pieces of art they endeavor 
to create. Theses pieces are devices used to understand and 
explain the world. —And not just the natural world, but the 
world of human perception, conditions, values and ethics, 
emotions, etc. The subject matter and means of investigation 
are different, but the architecture of the processes are similar 
across the art, science, engineering spectrum. Should we coin 
a word for this process? Is it research?
And they all work with what’s in front of them, using skills 
and talents that take time to acquire.
Artists
• 
create knowledge, language, alternative reality
• 
are image or “piece” driven
• 
seek to understand and explain
• 
design devices (their pieces) to explore the world and the self
• 
prefer contingent knowledge

Thus far we’ve muddied and complicated your ideas about 
science and art. We’ve deliberately made science look confus­
ing, and in particular made it appear to be seeking knowl­
edge without a solid philosophical footing. And we’ve made 
art look more principled than the simple yowling into the 
night many take it to be. That is, we’ve tried to explode your 
stereotypes. 
And we’ve hinted that artists and scientists (and engineers) 
work in much the same way: each explores, each discovers, 
and each understands (verifies and/or validates). 
But art–science is just one among perhaps many dimen­
sions that might describe how people work on creative endeav­
ors. Another is experimental-conceptual. This brings us back 
to noticing. How hard it is to notice when our rational minds 
try to layer our concepts on top of what is really out there. 
Our rational brains try to replace ongoing perception with 
symbols. Like a parser, we reduce the complex to the simple 
symbol, then move on; whereas art demands that we parse 
and parse again and parse again until we see what’s there in 
a new way. —So that even the already-crazy artist sometimes 
needs to use artificial means to see things as they are. 
Language—we’re talking about language.
t
Over the last 2000 years there have been about 900 at­
tempts to invent a language that is better than natural lan­
guage—either to be more logical, to be more precise, to be 
easier to learn, or to eliminate perceived design flaws. One 
question about natural languages is that even though people 
quite obviously made them, how were they designed? Were 
they designed in any sense? Do they reflect a certain struc­
ture in our brains, our DNA, the background order of the 
universe?
 Languages considered as engineering works are obviously 
flawed, and the good scientist or engineer desires to do better. 
Artists, though, seem to revel in natural language—love the 
mess the way painters love oils and watercolors, the unruli­
ness of them all. Arika Okrent argues like this:
…the urge to invent languages is as old and persis­
tent as language itself. It is at least as old and per­
sistent as the urge to complain about language. The 
primary motivation for inventing a new language has 
been to improve upon natural language, to eliminate 
its design flaws, or rather the flaws it has developed 
for lack of conscious design. Looked at from an engi­
neering perspective, language is a kind of disaster. [16]
Natural language clearly being not designed must lack the 
advantages of a well- and deliberately designed language—
complete with its verification. But natural languages have 
a distinct advantage—they support discovery and thought 
formulation—of just the sort the artists we’ve looked at so 
far have talked about. The messiness of natural languages 
gives them a power that we miss when we write in artificial 
languages, such as programming languages.
…natural language and the messy qualities that 
give it so much flexibility and power, and that make 
it so much more than a simple communication de­
vice. The ambiguity and lack of precision allow it to 
serve as an instrument of thought formulation, of ex­
perimentation and discovery. We don’t have to know 
exactly what we mean before we speak; we can figure 
it out as we go along. Or not. [16]
And in the hands of a careful writer, natural language can 
be as precise as it needs to be. Most programming language 
specifications have a core in natural language.
At the same time natural language still works as 
an instrument of thought transmission, one that can 
be made extremely precise and reliable when we need 
it to be, or left loose and sloppy when we can’t spare 
the time or effort. [16]
Let’s look at some code! <right below> [17]
Beautiful. We all know a language like this one, so it should 
be clear what it does, no?
Now look at some other code at the top of the next page [17].
This code is almost the same as the previous, but its author 
did something different and additional. Art and clarity were 
added.7 Compilers don’t care what names things have as long 
as they are precise and accurate in their distinctions. People 
are also interested in understanding, and here what can only 
7You might believe that an explanation was added, but the combination of 
the pure code + the artistic namings is the explanation you’re seeing. What 
was added (only the namings) by itself would be a work of art. 
void foo(int x[], int y, int z)
{
 if (z > y + 1)
 {
 int a = x[y], b = y + 1, c = z;
 while (b < c)
 {
 if (x[b] <= a) b++; else {
 int d = x[b]; x[b] = x[--c];
 x[c] = d;
 }
 }
 int e = x[--b]; x[b] = x[y];
 x[y] = e; foo(x, y, b);
 foo(x, c, z);
}

be called art has aided that aspect. Or perhaps, artistry was 
used to layer on an intended interpretation.
When messiness is missing, people naturally add it back 
by creating their own natural language on top of the parts 
of the artificial one that provide wiggle room. This is what’s 
happened in the example below [17].
Art can go pretty far in this direction. There is no need to 
run the shell script below to get its humor. By itself it’s a form 
of light verse, worthy of Ogden Nash, perhaps.
t
Earlier we talked about artistic processes. Poets and others 
sometimes engage in processes of defamiliarization in order 
to see the world differently. At the top of the left column on 
the next page is a poem rpg “wrote” by using Babelfish as a 
defamiliarization aid. A Robert Frost poem was run through 
a number of cycles of translation to and through other lan­
guages then back to English to undo the idioms and figures 
of speech that Frost used originally, producing a set of raw 
language with which to start to construct a poem—a poem 
both weirdly similar to the original and dementedly different .
Just glance at it for a minute.
Frost’s original [18] is at the top of the right column on 
the next page. 
t
When we think formally about creative acts, the question 
arises: Where does new stuff come from? The philosopher 
Charles Sanders Peirce recognized that traditional logical 
induction and deduction were closed wrt prior assumptions 
and data: they cannot produce new ideas. He proposed ab­
duction to explain the form of reasoning that leads to new 
ideas. Informally, such an inference leads from an observa­
tion of a situation that is not yet understood to a hypothesis 
that, if true, explains the observed phenomenon. Peirce wrote:
Now, that the matter of no new truth can come 
from induction or from deduction, we have seen. It 
can only come from abduction; and abduction is, after 
all, nothing but guessing. We are therefore bound to 
hope that, although the possible explanations of our 
facts may be strictly innumerable, yet our mind will 
be able, in some finite number of guesses, to guess the 
sole true explanation of them. That we are bound to 
assume, independently of any evidence that it is true. 
Animated by that hope, we are to proceed to the con­
struction of a hypothesis. [19]
Here’re brief descriptions of abduction, deduction, and 
induction. In deduction, one proceeds from an antecedent a 
by logical manipulation to a consequent b. In induction, one 
proceeds from a set of structured empirical observations of a 
and b together to infer that a → b. In abduction, one observes 
b—some phenomenon not yet understood—and guesses that 
an antecedent a accounts for b (i.e., a → b), giving rise to the 
hypothesis, a. Now, having a hypothesis, normal hypothetico-
deductive science can begin—verification.
E.g., suppose you know that all the stones on a particular 
Virginia beach are white. Then you see white stones on a table 
next to the beach. Deduction does not dictate the stones are 
from the beach—perhaps a truck driver from Missouri left 
them there. There are no regular observations of such stones 
having come from the beach, so induction is useless. A rea­
sonable abductive inference, however, is that the stones are 
from the beach. This illustrates the idea of abduction as in­
ference to the best explanation. With hypothesis in hand, one 
can then deduce consequences and test the theory. One might 
void quicksort(int array[], int begin, int end)
{
 if (end > begin + 1)
 {
 int pivot = array[begin],
 l = begin + 1, r = end;
 while (l < r)
 {
 if (array[l] <= pivot)
 l++;
 else
 swap(&array[l], &array[--r]);
 }
 swap(&array[--l], &array[beg]);
 sort(array, begin, l);
 sort(array, r, end);

do a statistical test of table-stone sizes against beach-stone 
sizes, or do a comparative analysis of chemical characteristics. 
Abduction engages the imaginative capacity of the hu­
man mind to envision possible worlds (“these stones came 
from the beach”). It is thus a modal form of logical reason­
ing, and a form capable of producing a new idea: a “logical 
leap of the mind.” 
Abduction is also non-monotonic—the validity of the 
inference is always contingent on future information. If the 
chemical analysis comes back negative, well, then, the stones 
really weren’t from the beach after all. Such a willingness to 
guess a good solution—to go with it—open to reconsider­
ing it, is essential to such modern software practices as agile 
programming.
Before dismissing guessing as unscientific, consider Feyn­
man’s explanation of how one makes scientific discoveries: 
In general, we look for a new law by the following 
process. First we guess it. Then we compute the con­
sequences of the guess to see what would be implied 
if this law that we guessed is right. [20] 
Feynman worked abductively. The Stanford Encyclopedia 
of Philosophy states:
Scientific method begins with abduction: a con­
jecture or hypothesis about what actually is going on. 
Then, by means of deductive inference, conclusions 
are drawn from the hypothesis about other things that 
must obtain if the hypothesis is assumed to be true. 
These other things, it is hoped, can be experimentally 
tested-for. Finally, hypothesis-testing is performed 
by seeking experimentally to detect something that 
has been deduced to obtain from the hypothesis. [21]
The concept of a form of reasoning that leads to conclu­
sions that are not necessary but possible is in fact very old. 
Aliseda-Llera notes that it dates to Aristotle’s apogoge [22]. 
Laplace addressed in detail the process of reasoning from 
effects (data) to causes (hypotheses). Peirce was responsible 
for the name, abduction, and for placing abduction in the 
context of what then emerged as modern logic.
Nor is the idea new that abductive reasoning is important 
to invention and discovery. Peirce was clear on the matter. 
And later in the late 1950s, the philosopher of science, Nor­
wood Russell Hanson, argued against the notions of Popper 
and others who insisted on hypothetico-deductive (H‑D) 
processes as the essential heart of the scientific method. Han­
son was interested in the intellectual activity that gave rise to 
novel hypotheses, and not so much in the subsequent (and in 
his view more mundane and formal) activities of deducing 
consequences and testing them. He referred back to the Peir­
cian notion of abductive reasoning, arguing that it instead 
was essential to creativity in science: 
Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
Stopping by http://babelfish.altavista.com on a Snowy Evening
Here is a task whose outcome is certain:
Thinking of someone’s forest
and then thinking whether this forest is that someone’s.
And as for his house (I’ve picked this up):
it is certainly located in town.
I am stopped here paying attention to the snow above,
observing the trees filling in above the snow.
My eye finds comfort in this.
As for my horse, he strangely and narrowly stops.
I am small, me and the small end of the tree both agree.
To the horse, we are stopped between a farm and the frozen sea.
This evening is the strangest and the darkest of the year, the horse must think.
His harness bells are his only user interface.
These bells are installed to a flange by some wiring, and so
he gives the flange a shock, vibrating the wires,
thereby jolting the bells (giving them a restlessness)
in order to pose me a question:
Is there some kind of mistake here?
Surely a certain error exists.
He is a small horse.
There is only one other sound,
a different sound like a clay tone,
but only to the extent of a thin layer or a languid ribbon
forming a closed loop: the sweepback of a light breeze
over downy soft flakes—a simple, easy wind;
flakes like cotton wool or hair
or a rag for cleaning, which is the same thing.
Or maybe it sounds like this:
khlop!
(I am excited by this.)
Woods are attractive. Likable. Lovable, even.
Or sometimes—obscure. One of the trees
is dark and from a place which is deep.
And you know what they say: Dark and deep are deep.
But I am held to obligations which I must maintain.
Before I sleep I must resume my outward journey.
(And other unspecified things of the same class.)

Physicists do not start from hypotheses; they start 
from data. By the time a law has been fixed into an 
H-D [hypothetico-deductive] system, really original 
thinking is over. [23]
Hanson’s position led to arguments in the philosophy of 
science over several decades. For example, an infinite num­
ber of hypotheses can be inferred abductively from a single 
observation; how does one choose? Sami Paavola presented 
a summary of the principal objections and a refutation: 
Deductive logic is not enough, and the model of 
abductive inference is especially needed in order to 
understand the processes of discovery. But abduction 
in itself is not enough. Besides validity considerations 
(which are in themselves important in abduction) 
there is the art of using (abductive) reasoning. [24]
Abduction provides power when used intelligently, stra­
tegically, artfully, in a value-seeking process. Getting a little 
closer to home, we view critical parts of the software system 
design process as involving not the deduction of code from 
specifications, but creative exploration and discovery.
One of the keys to an artful and effective use of abduc­
tion is iteration—iterated guessing, testing, and refinement 
of provisional hypothesis. Toshio Itoh wrote: 
Abduction is both essential to and effective for cre­
ativity. Abduction, which allows a role for the per­
sonality, is the only thought process that actually 
fosters creativity. Abduction is outward-looking.... 
Abduction is self-correcting. Abduction validates or 
invalidates hypotheses by constantly exposing their 
consequences or the assumptions behind them to new 
facts and continually subjecting everything to practi­
cal verification. [25]
Iterative development processes work not by hoping to 
derive everything from a specification assumed to be correct, 
but by continual guessing, testing, and refining. Development 
involves design. In The Design of Business: Why Design Think­
ing is the Next Competitive Advantage, Roger Martin states:
Whether they realize it or not, designers live in 
Peirce’s world of abduction; they actively look for 
new data points, challenge accepted explanations, 
and infer possible new worlds. [26]
Martin argues that most contemporary organizations 
not only fail to support this style of thinking: they actively 
stamp it out. The problem is that the needs of creative de­
sign, which seeks valid constructs—constructs that actually 
solve the right problems—conflict with demands for reliable 
performance which is obtained by processes that eschew the 
unpredictability of creativity: e.g., delivering predictable prof­
its on a quarterly basis through measurement and inductive 
projection. Martin says, “delving into mysteries is the most 
expensive activity…because you literally don’t know what 
you are doing….” Long-term viability of economic enter­
prises, Martin argues, is in balancing reliability and validity.
Martin formulates his proposal for business in terms of 
three stages of knowledge refinement. One starts with a mys­
tery, a problem, an anomaly, that “excites our curiosity but 
eludes our understanding.” The leap to the next stage is by 
abduction: in the form of a guess (sometimes wild) as to an 
appropriate solution. The guess, or hypothesis, is a “concept 
providing for a simplified and manageable understanding [of 
what is often a very complex domain] and the ability to focus 
efforts, to guide organized exploration of possibilities.” Such 
a hypothesis leads to a valid heuristic solution. The third step 
is to systematize that heuristic solution: to make an algorithm, 
a certified production process, which guarantees that results 
with particular attributes will be produced reliably.
Martin’s central argument is that contemporary organiza­
tions are overly focused on reliability rather than on valid­
ity: for example, on producing hamburgers with vanishingly 
small parameter variations, rather than on producing what 
people really want to eat. Mihnea Moldoveanu, quoted in 
Martin’s book, argues, “the ‘inductive fallacy’ is that of in­
ferring validity from reliability.”
It’s easy to see that some artists know a lot about abduction, 
at least tacitly. The sentences in a short story are not sufficient 
to deduce the story that appears in your head as you read it. 
Good short story writers know how much is needed for most 
readers to abduce essentially the same story.
And producing the work of art in the first place requires 
constant discovery and guessing—because all works of art 
are works of exploration and discovery. Robert Boswell, the 
fiction writer, puts it like this:
I have grown to understand narrative as a form of 
contemplation, a complex and seemingly incongruous 
way of thinking. I come to know my stories by writing 
my way into them. I focus on the characters without 
trying to attach significance to their actions. I do 
not look for symbols. For as long as I can, I remain 
purposefully blind to the machinery of the story and 
only partially cognizant of the world my story creates. 
I work from a kind of half-knowledge.
In the drafts that follow, I listen to what has made 
it to the page. Invariably, things have arrived that I 
did not invite, and they are often the most interest­
ing things in the story. By refusing to fully know the 
world, I hope to discover unusual formations in the 
landscape, and strange desires in the characters. By 
declining to analyze the story, I hope to keep it open 
to surprise. Each new draft revises the world but does 
not explain or define it. I work through many drafts, 

12
direction—even if he or she planned out the piece in great 
detail—but sooner or later the piece would take over and the 
writer would be along for the ride.
But this isn’t true. The poems we just showed you, and to an 
extent the code as well, are not the product of unbounded ex­
ploration and discovery. Each of them was based on a concept. 
In contrast, artists who have made conceptual in­
novations have been motivated by the desire to com­
municate specific ideas or emotions. Their goals for a 
particular work can usually be stated precisely, before 
its production, either as a desired image or a desired 
process for the work’s execution. Conceptual artists 
consequently make detailed preparatory sketches of 
plans for their paintings. [28]
In the defamiliarized Frost poem, rpg’s concept was to use 
Babelfish to make a set of ridiculous translations of the well-
known poem in order to free it of its now-familiar wording. 
He had it translate the poem from English to Greek, then to 
Korean, then to Japanese, then to German, and back to Eng­
lish; he used a set of such cyclic translations as the starting 
point for his poem. This is conceptual art.
For experimental artists:
… planning a painting is unimportant. The subject 
selected might be simply a convenient object of study, 
and frequently the artist returns to work on a motif 
he has used in the past. Some experimental painters 
begin without a specific subject in mind, preferring 
instead to let the subject emerge as they work. Ex­
perimental painters rarely make elaborate prepara­
tory sketches. Their most important decisions are 
made during the working stage. The artist typically 
alternates between applying paint and examining the 
emerging image; at each point, how he develops the 
image depends on his reaction to what he sees. [28]
For conceptual artists:
…planning is the most important stage. Before he 
begins working, the conceptual artist wants to have 
a clear vision either of the completed work or of the 
process that will produce it. Conceptual artists con­
sequently often make detailed preparatory sketches 
or other plans for a painting. With the difficult deci­
sions already made in the planning stage, working and 
stopping are straightforward. The artist executes the 
plan and stops when he has completed it.
...extreme practitioners...make all the decisions for 
a work before beginning it. It is unclear, however, if 
this is literally possible. There are artists who came 
close to it, and perhaps achieved it, during the 1960s, 
progressively abandoning the familiar. What I can 
see is always dwarfed by what I cannot know. What 
the characters come to understand never surpasses 
that which they cannot grasp. The world remains 
half-known.
…
There can be no discovery in a world where every­
thing is known. A crucial part of the writing endeavor 
is to practice remaining in the dark. [27]
In the cycle of explore-discover-understand, creative acts 
take place in the discover phase, where abduction—guess­
ing—happens. Exploring with an open mind—perhaps with 
defocused attention—an artist or scientist might guess / hyo­
thesize that something might be the case or might be worth 
turning into a work of art. Then in understanding the guess—
either verifying / validating it as a scientist or working out 
its best artistic expression as an artist, one can then embark 
on further exploration, further discovery, and further un­
derstanding. 
The astronomer Heber Curtis had a hunch (a guess con­
stituting a possible discovery) that the entire universe was 
not the same as the Milky Way (our galaxy), and that the 
Andromeda Nebula was actually a separate galaxy. This was 
the subject of the Great Debate in 1920 between Heber Curtis 
and Harlow Shapley. Later, Edwin Hubble believed if he could 
find (explore; discover) a Cepheid variable star in the Nebula, 
information about its luminosity and period would tell us 
how far away it was and settle (understand; verify) whether 
it was in the Milky Way. And in fact Andromeda turned out 
to be a separate, far away galaxy. This is an example of fractal 
nature of the explore-discover-understand process. And also 
that the process need not occur within one scientist’s mind.
t
But not all scientists—or even artists—work exclusively 
in the realm of “stuff”; not all writers write without a plan, a 
concept; not all scientists work exclusively from data to hy­
pothesis. There is another relevant dimension which addresses 
this objection: the dimension of experimental to conceptual.
Artists who have produced experimental innova­
tions have been motivated by aesthetic criteria: they 
have aimed at presenting visual perceptions. Their 
goals are imprecise, so their procedure is tentative 
and incremental. The imprecision of their goals means 
that these artists rarely feel they have succeeded, and 
their careers are consequently often dominated by 
the pursuit of a single objective. [27]
When we first started thinking about art, we believed that 
all art—especially writing—was what is called experimental 
art. We believed that a good writer just started out in some 

13
by making plans for their work and having these plans 
executed by others. [28]
In painting, Cézanne is an experimental artist and Picasso 
is conceptual. Generally and interestingly, the masterpieces 
of experimental artists are done at an older age than for con­
ceptual artists.
Back in the 1970s, a curmudgeonly professor at the MIT 
AI Lab noticed the experimental-conceptual dimension. Jo­
seph Weizenbaum is best known for writing the Eliza pro­
gram, which pretended—in a trivial fashion—to be a Freud­
ian therapist.
But he was irked by the programmers at the AI Lab, espe­
cially Richard Stallman. He painted a picture of the “ordi­
nary professional programmer” and contrasted it with the 
“hacker,” meaning someone like Stallman.
The professional programmer worked like a conceptual 
artist, making plans in detail, and perhaps not even execut­
ing them himself, but delegating that to an underling—or 
perhaps an apprentice.
The ordinary [professional] programmer will...gen­
erally do lengthy preparatory work, such as writing 
and flow diagramming, before beginning work with 
the computer itself. His sessions with the computer 
may be comparatively short. He may even let others 
do the actual console work. He develops his program 
slowly and systematically. When something doesn’t 
work, he may spend considerable time away from the 
computer framing careful hypotheses to account for 
the malfunction and designing crucial experiments 
to test them....When he has finally composed the pro­
gram he set out to produce, he is able to complete a 
sensible description of it and turn his attention to 
other things. [29]
The hacker—whom he delicately called a “compulsive pro­
grammer”—acts like an experimental artist, just digging in 
with only the dimmest glimmer of what to do, and eventu­
ally something comes out.
The compulsive programmer is usually a superb 
technician,...one who knows every detail of the com­
puter he works on, its peripheral equipment, the com­
puter’s operating system, etc....He can write small 
subsystem programs quickly, that is, in one or two 
sessions of, say, 20 hours each....His main interest...is 
in very large, very ambitious systems of programs....
[T]he systems he undertakes to build have very gran­
diose but extremely imprecisely stated goals. Some 
examples...are: new computer languages to facilitate 
man-machine communication; a general system that 
can be taught to play any board game; a system to 
make it easier for computer experts to write super-
systems. [29]
And like the experimental artist or poet, if anything good 
emerges it’s because of technique and skill, not knowledge. 
Not something to form theories about, not something ame­
nable to science.
The compulsive programmer...calls what he does 
“hacking.”...He cannot set before himself a clearly de­
fined long-term goal and a plan for achieving it, for 
he has only technique, not knowledge. He has nothing 
he can analyze or synthesize; in short, he has nothing 
to form theories about....
(It has to be said that not all hackers are pathologi­
cally compulsive programmers. Indeed, were it not 
for the often, in its own terms, highly creative labor 
of people who proudly claim the title “hacker,” few of 
today’s sophisticated computer time-sharing systems, 
computer language translators, computer graphics 
systems, etc., would exist.) [29]
t
The space of how people work at creative endeavors is at 
least as complex as depicted in the diagram above.
Let’s start with conceptual artists. Sometimes they are 
forced into it because their medium is not malleable, not like 
words on a page or in a file. (Note that the advent of comput­
ers for writing made it easier to be an experimental writer 
for having a much more malleable medium for the words to 
live on or in.)
Experimental artists are like Cézanne, like a lot of pre-
computer-age poets, like the fiction writer Robert Boswell, 
like hackers in the 1970s perhaps. 
Conceptual scientists are like mathematicians and Ein­
stein; like theoretical physicist such as Feynman.
Experimental scientists are like engineers, or the complex­
ity scientists who use agent-based simulations to understand 
systems and try to manipulate them.

tems or sketches that show only the big ideas; experimental

ones like to get their hands or minds around the stuff itself. 
Kent Beck calls source code “stuff.” Drew McDermott, a 
computer scientist at Yale, once said, “what I like about Lisp 
is that you can feel the bits between your toes.”
Artists believe that the key part of making art is explora­
tion and discovery, while scientists believe the key part of 
doing science is understanding and verification. Notice that 
we wrote “believe.” 
In fact, generally, artists evaluate their discoveries and re­
vise like crazy—writers convene circles of friends and work­
shops to examine and critique drafts. And in fact, scientists 
have nothing to understand and verify unless they have ex­
plored and discovered. Conceptual artists and scientists play 
with and explore abstractions and ideas—their “stuff.”
Scientists and artists are blind to what they actually do and 
how they really work. The problem with the diagram on the 
previous page is that it is static—everyone working on a cre­
ative project moves all over this 2-dimensional space while 
working. —Because they are all people, and people mostly 
work the same ways. Sometimes they explore and discover, 
sometimes they verify and control, sometimes they work in 
the realm of ideas, and sometimes they manipulate materials.
Cézanne played. He struggled to develop an authentic 
observation of the seen world by the most accurate method 
of representing it in paint that he could find. To this end, he 
structurally ordered whatever he perceived into simple forms 
and color planes (abstractions). His artistic goals were things 
he could only approach and never achieve, and that’s why 
he kept trying, with his best works coming late in life. His 
ideas were not concepts that came in a flash, but something 
he painted and painted and painted. He stalked art, he pur­
sued it like a series pursues its convergence.
Picasso thought of himself as someone from whom art 
sprung whole. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon is considered by 
many to be his masterpiece. He carefully planned it. The 
painting portrays five nude prostitutes in a brothel in Barce­
lona. The figures are physically jarring, none conventionally 
feminine, all slightly menacing, and each is rendered with an 
angular and disjointed body shape. Two of the women have 
African-mask-like faces, giving them a savage and mysterious 
aura. This is a variant of Primitivism. Picasso also abandoned 
perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane. 
Picasso stated that his art was the result of what he had 
found—as opposed to showing his seeking, as Cézanne did—
but he claimed to not believe in research. 
I can hardly understand the importance given to 
the word “research” in connection with modern paint­
ing. To find, is the thing....
When I paint my object is to show what I have 
found, not what I am looking for....
I have never made trials or experiments. Whenever 
I had something to say, I have said it in the manner 
in which I have felt it ought to be said. [30]
Yet, for Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, Picasso did over 400 
studies and sketches, a record for artistic preparation. If this 
isn’t playing, experimenting, and researching, we confess to 
not knowing what those things are.
t
Artists, scientists, and engineers approach their work in 
similar ways, with nearly the same set of creative and concep­
tual tools. This seems obvious to us, but maybe not to most, 
and possibly not to scientists. What if it were possible to be 
a better scientist by using techniques from art?
Consider this experiment: Look at the grammar at the bot­
tom of the column. A scientist is shown 45 strings of length 
between 6 and 9 generated by it, and asked to copy down each 
one. The original list and copies are removed, and a short 
time later, the scientist is asked to look at 60 strings made up 
of the letters X, V, M, R, & T, 30 of which were generated by 
that grammar and 30 by a different one; next, the scientist is 
told that the strings he or she had copied had something in 
common, and he or she is asked to classify these 60 strings 
according to whether it had that same thing in common.

The classification task is a mystery, and coming up with a 
grammar that corresponds to the original 45 strings requires 
guessing—abduction. But, any performed abduction takes 
place implicitly in the scientist’s mind. What’s been described 
is a common tool to measure implicit learning—or implicit 
abduction: what grammar can give rise to the 45 test strings?
Now suppose a group of 40 people, broken into two 20-per­
son groups, is asked to do the above experiment, but before 
that, each group is asked to read an illustrated short story. 
One group is asked to read a revision of Kafka’s “The Country 
Doctor,” which is a (slightly) absurdist story [31]. The other 
group is asked to read a straightforward version of the same 
story [31]. What would happen? 
Camus wrote about Kafka:
In this fundamental ambiguity lies Kafka’s secret. 
These perpetual oscillations between the natural and 
the extraordinary, the individual and the universal, 
the tragic and the everyday, the absurd and the logi­
cal, are found throughout his work and give it both 
its resonance and its meaning. [32]
Travis Proulx and Steven J. Heine did this experiment, 
and found that the group that read the absurd version of the 
story were 26% more accurate (correctly identified strings 
from the grammar) than the other, and classified 33% more 
strings as belonging to the grammar (ignoring whether they 
were right or wrong) [33]. Proulx and Heine claim this lat­
ter result is because of increased motivation, but perhaps it’s 
just increased energy.
The straightforward version of the story is linear and bor­
ing. It doesn’t require any guesswork to get its “meaning,” 
which in this case is nothing more than its (dull) plot and 
happy ending. The absurd version is not particularly crazy 
or surreal, but it does call for abduction to try to make sense 
of it. Like many surreal and absurdist stories, no abductions 
work well, and the reader is left with a sense of mystery and 
strangeness. But the brain is hard at work abducing and be­
coming defamiliarized, just as we saw other artists doing. No 
wonder, then, that with the mind open to far-flung connec­
tions it is able to learn a little more effectively and confidently.
t
Over the past century or so, there have been persistent 
and dedicated efforts to “scientifically” control development 
and production processes. Such efforts have made a big dif­
ference to the quality of manufacturing though we can’t say 
it’s helped the quality of design much.
Scientific processes have also been pushed in the realm 
of software development, and we believe this is a significant 
error—an error based on misperceiving how work actually 
takes place in designing and creating software. 
Scientific processes, whether for product development, 
manufacturing, or service delivery, seek to minimize vari­
ances in task execution through the imposition of tight con­
straints, measurement systems, and feedback control.
An artistic process tolerates or even welcomes a variety of 
inputs and works to produce the best (or at least an accept­
able) result given the inputs and the situations encountered 
while executing the process. In particular, an artistic process 
can adapt to very poorly stated requirements or even no re­
quirements at all (aside from the production of something of 
value). Artistic processes endeavor to invent and blaze new 
trails. In many cases the value of the outcome of an artistic 
process will be determined only after the product has been 
produced, though it’s often possible to make some judgments 
along the way. [34]
Many aspects of software development require an artistic 
approach, an approach that acknowledges that sometimes 
exploration and discovery are required. Sometimes artistic 
processes are experimental—because source code and soft­
ware are malleable and subject to “play”—but sometimes they 
are conceptual, achieved through blackboard designs, role 
playing, simulations, and modeling. Moving through the art 
/ science / concept / experiment space is fractal.
Artistic approaches work best when requirements are 
sparse, incomplete, or even simply wrong or poorly stated. 
They also work where invention is desired.
Yet, pressure continues to be placed on software creation 
to fall in line with scientific processes. This is because, we 
believe, people would really like to see software creation con­
form to their caricature of an engineering discipline. Software 
creation is not there yet. The manufacturing metaphor came 
to be when producing code a line at a time looked a lot like 
laborers laying sleepers and rails. 
But even producing software where everything is well un­
derstood, mistakes are made and programmers spend their 
time trying to wrangle the code into behaving the way they 
clearly see it in their minds. 
Always, the creation of software requires at least one cycle 
through the explore–discover–understand space—if for no 
other reason than vision, requirements, and specifications 
are a mystery, while design and code are abductions. When 
we bother to watch how work gets done—regardless of the 
theory that sits in your head about how it should be done—
we see this everywhere in software development.
And this isn’t only a local phenomenon—it happens at all 
levels. This is what Weizenbaum missed when he watched or­
dinary professional programmers—even though they didn’t 
sully their hands with actually punching in code and over­
seeing its execution, they were forced to reconsider, replan, 
and reformulate, just as Picasso did in his sketchbooks: they 
played with “stuff” that happened to be abstract.
The real problem with the scientific approach to software 
isn’t that it’s wrong all the time; it’s just that it’s not right all 
the time. It’s a one-size fits all philosophy. People who dig 
into the nature of software creation recognize that in many 
cases there is a cycle of exploration and discovery with a heavy 

16
dose of getting it to work. This is in part because when we de­
velop software we are creating novel worlds without imposed 
constraints on what’s possible—there are only the constraints 
we imagine up to put in place. Circumstances dictate the ap­
propriate process. Perhaps now we can begin to distinguish 
conditions when it is likely to pay to go abductive / creative 
/ artistic rather than deductive / scientific.
t
We need to look closely at what creative work is really like 
and adopt techniques and processes that support it. Education 
is part of it. Possibly artistry has been pushed aside because 
it’s not well understood. A common definition of an artist is 
“a person who expresses himself through a medium.” Cer­
tainly some artists do this, but not all, and perhaps not the 
majority. It would be just as true to say that an engineer is “a 
person who expresses himself through bridges.”
