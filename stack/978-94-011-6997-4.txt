PREFACE 
The Handbook of Electronics Formulas, Symbols and Defini-
tions has been compiled for engineers, technicians, armed 
forces personnel, commercial operators, students, hobbyists, 
and all others who have some knowledge of electronic terms, 
symbols, and theory. 
The author's intention has been to provide: 
A small, light reference book that may be easily carried in 
an attache case or kept in a desk drawer for easy access. 
A source for the majority of all electronic formulas, sym-
bols, and definitions needed or desired for today's passive 
and active analog circuit technology. 
A format in which a desired formula may be located almost 
instantly without the use of an index, in the desired trans-
position, and in sufficiently parenthesized linear form for 
direct use with any scientific calculator. 
Sufficient information, alternate methods, approximations, 
schematic diagrams, and/or footnotes in such a manner so 
that technicians and hobbyists may understand and use the 
majority of the formulas, and that is acceptable and equally 
useful to engineers and others very knowledgeable in the 
field.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
Much of the material is this Handbook is based upon a small 
loose-leaf notebook containing formulas and other reference 
material compiled over many years. With the passage of time, 
the sources of this material have become unknown. It is impos-
sible therefore to list and give the proper credit. 
It is possible, however, to give richly deserved recognition to 
Juergen Wahl for his assistance during preparation of the 
manuscript. His suggestions, comments, proofreading, and 
checking of formulas for accuracy are all greatly appreciated. 
Special thanks are due to my wife and family for their 
understanding and acceptance of long periods of neglect, with-
out which this book would not have been possible.

INTRODUCTION 
All fonnulas in this Handbook use only the basic units of all 
terms. It is especially easy in this age of scientific calculators 
to convert to and from basic units. 
Formulas in all sections are listed alphabetically by symbol 
with the exception of applicable passive circuit symbols, 
where, for a given resultant, all series circuit formulas are listed 
first, followed by parallel and complex circuit formulas. 
If the symbol for an electronic term is unknown, a liberally 
cross-referenced listing of electronic terms and their corre-
sponding symbols may be found in the appendix. 
Symbols of all reactive magnitude terms in fonnulas have 
been consistently given the signs conventionally associated 
with them to maintain capacitive or inductive identity. In rec-
tangular quantities, this also allows identification of the com-
plex number as representing a series equivalent impedance/ 
voltage or a parallel equivalent admittance/current. 
To prevent possible confusion, all symbols representing 
vector quantities in polar or rectangular fonn have been 
printed in boldface. 
A number of fonnulas have the potential to develop a zero 
divisor. Conventional mathematics prohibits a division by zero, 
and calculators will overflow if this is attempted. However, 
fonnulas noted GD allow the manual conversion of the recipro-
cal of zero to infinity and the reciprocal of infmity to zero. 
Division by zero in fonnulas noted @ is prohibited. 
Textbooks conventionally use italic (slanted) type for quan-
tity symbols and roman (upright) type for unit symbols. How-
ever, this Handbook follows the example of almost all technical 
manuals, using roman type for both quantity and unit symbols.

@ Rs = Series R, Xs = Series X. 
® B and X are magnitudes, however both B and X have been "given" 
the signs usually associated with capacitive and inductive quantities. 
Be therefore "equals" -B, BL "equals" +B, Xc "equals" -X and 
XL "equals" + X. This allows direct identification of a reactive 
quantity derived from any formula in this handbook. 
@) The form (±8) is used as a reminder that the sign of the phase angle 
determines the sign of B and therefore the identity of B as either 
capacitive or inductive.

® When using a calculator to obtain the log of a number smaller than 
one, the value of both the characteristic and the mantissa are likely 
to be different than the value obtained from log tables. The calcu-
lator value will have both a negative characteristic and a negative 
mantissa. This is the correct value to use. (Log tables always have a 
positive mantissa)

Voltage & Phase 
I mportant Notes 
1. It should be understood by the reader that the phase angle 
of voltage and current is the same one and only phase angle 
of a circuit or of a circuit element. The fact that current 
leads the voltage while the voltage lags the current in an 
inductive circuit means only that the signs of the voltage 
and current phase angles are different. 
2. In a given circuit, the phase angle of voltage, current, im-
pedance and admittance is the same one and only phase 
angle. The signs of the angle is the only difference. ±8E = 
-(±8!) = ±8z = -(±8y ). 
3. The voltage phase angle uses the current phase angle as a 
reference (0°) while the current phase angle uses the volt-
age phase angle as a reference (0°). Due to this fact, if the 
voltage phase angle is expressed, the current phase angle 
is 0° and if the current phase angle is expressed, the volt-
age phase angle is 0°. It should be obvious that the voltage 
and current phase angles cannot be used at the same time. 
4. The same applies to rectangular form voltage and current. 
Rectangular form current cannot have an imaginary (reac-
tive) component when the rectangular form voltage has an 
imaginary (reactive) component. The reverse, obviously, 
is also true. 
5. Due to this confusing situation and the high probability 
of error, the author DOES NOT RECOMMEND THE USE 
OF POLAR OR RECTANGULAR FORM VOLTAGE OR 
CURRENT WHERE EACH USES THE OTHER AS A 
REFERENCE. THE USE OF THE GENERATOR AS THE 
PHASE REFERENCE IS RECOMMENDED. 
6. The following polar and rectangular form voltage formulas 
are listed for reference only. Proceed to the Eo and vector 
algebra Eo formulas.

fr = Symbol for frequency of resonance. 
Resonant Frequency 
Definitions 
fr = 1. The frequency at which the circuit acts as a pure resis-
tance. In a series circuit, the frequency at which the 
impedance is lowest. In a parallel circuit, the frequency 
at which the impedance is highest. 
2. The frequency at which the inductive reactance equals 
the capacitive reactance. 
Note: Defmition 2 is commonly used due to simpler mathematics, but 
in many low Q circuits, it is a poor approximation. 
When Q is high, the difference between the defmitions is negligible.

I 
Current & Phase 
Important Notes 
1. It should be understood that the phase angle of voltage , cur-
rent, impedance and admittance is the same, one and only, 
phase angle in a given circuit. The fact that the sign of the 
voltage or impedance phase angle differs from the sign of the 
current or admittance phase angle means only that if the cur-
rent leads the voltage, the voltage must lag the current by 
the same angle. 
2. ±Ol = -(tOE) = -(±Oz) = ±Oy 
3. When using the phase angle of impedance (or admittance), 
a phase angle always exists when the circuit is reactive. The 
phase angle of voltage and current however can only exist 
for one of the two at the same time. When the voltage phase 
angle exists, the current phase angle must be 0° and when 
the current phase angle exists, the voltage phase angle must 
be 0°. This is explained by the fact the voltage uses the cur-
rent as a reference and the current uses the voltage as a 
reference. 
4. The same situation exists with voltage and current in rec-
tangular form. When ''imaginary'' current exists, the voltage 
must be EI.!t... or E + jO and when "imaginary" voltage 
exists, the current must be IL!t or 1+ jO. 
5. For practical problems, the best method of minimizing con-
fusion and errors is to use the phase angle of the generator 
as the 0° reference. If the generator is a current source, the 
phase angle of the total current is always 0° and if the gen-
erator is a voltage source, the phase angle of the total voltage 
is always 0°. 
Note: The rectangular current of a series circuit driven by a voltage 
source represents the currents through an equivalent parallel circuit. 
The rectangular voltage of a parallel circuit driven by a current 
source represents the voltages across elements of the equivalent 
series circuit.

IpOLAR = Ij±OI = I/-(±Oz) 
IRECT = 1. The 0° and ±90° currents which produce a re-

2. The current through resistance and net reactance

3. The current through the parallel equivalent re-
sistance and net reactance of a series circuit. 
(Note: Only one current is possible in a series circuit.) 
IRECT = IR - (±Ix) j 
IRECT = [I cos 01] - [-I sin(±OI~ j 
IRECT = [I cos Oz] - [I sin(±Oz~ j 
Note: The above rectangular form is strongly recommended 
for most uses. The negative sign will always identify the 
complex quantity as current or admittance and as a parallel 
equivalent quantity. The use of 8 Z eliminates the double 
change of signs often needed and maintains the identity of 
the reactive quantity at all times. 
Note: The rectangular form of current has been used by 
some as a substitute for rectangular admittance (VRECT) 
for solving series circuits in parallel. It should be noted that 
if the assumed Voltage is one, 'RECT and VRECT are iden-
tical in meaning and method except for the names of the 
quantities. When E = l/.ff:..., 'POLAR = VPOLAR, 'RECT = 
VRECT, IR = G, IC = BC' IL = BL, -IX = -B, +Ix = +B and

Note: Use formulas on following page to obtain 'POLAR 
then convert to 'RECT using above formulas.

Definitions 
P = Symbol for power 
P = The rate at which energy is utilized to produce 
work. The rate at which work is done. The rate at 
which electrical energy is transformed to another 
form of energy such as heat, light, radiation, sound, 
mechanical work, potential energy in any form or 
any combination of any of the forms of energy. 
P = Electrical power expressed or measured in watts 
(W) 
Power is also expressed in dBm, microwatts (J,lW), 
milliwatts (mW), kilowatts (kW), megawatts (MW), 
etc. 
Ppeak = Instantaneous peak power 
P = Effective or average power 
P = Ede • Ide = Erms • Irms 
(pure resistances only) 
P =1= Eaverage • Iaverage 
Psinewave = Power produced by sinewave voltage and current, 
not the wave shape of the power. (Power wave-
shapes are rarely used except for rectangular waves 
where the waveshapes of power, voltage and cur-
rent are identical.) 
P ae = P de in heating effect and all other transformations 
of electrical energy 
P = Zero in all purely reactive circuits 
P = Zero when the phase angle of the current with 
respect to the voltage equals ±90°

<D Admittance is a complex quantity requumg the mathematical 
operations of addition and subtraction to be performed in rectangu-
lar form. Rectangular form quantities may be multiplied like other 
binomials except that P = -1. Reciprocals or other division by 
rectangular form quantities requires the divisor to be rationalized 
by multiplication of both the divisor and the dividend by the con-
jugate of the divisor. (The conjugate of G - Bj is G + Bj). When 
using a calculator, it is easier to convert rectangular quantities to 
polar form for multiplication and division then reconverting to 
rectangular form for addition and subtraction.

ZNotes: 
@ Mathematics and calculators do not allow a division by zero or in-
finity. In formulas noted @however, the reciprocal of zero may be 
manually converted to infinity and the reciprocal of infmity may be 
manually converted to zero. The following additional manual op-
erations may also be performed as required: 
x • 00 = 00 when x "" 0, x/oo = 0 when x "" 00 
x . 0 = 0 when x "" 00, 
x/O = 00 when x "" 0 
Ox = 0 when x "" 0, 
ooX = 00 when x "" 0 
Calculators require the substitution of a very small number such as 
1 0-30 for zero and of a very large number such as 1 030 for infmity 
to perform these operations. All very small resultants must then be 
accepted as zero and all very large resultants must be accepted as in-
finity. Extreme care must be exercised to avoid accidental violation 
of the listed exceptions whenever more than one zero and/or in-
finity appear in the same formula. The arc tangent of infinity may 
be obtained from a calculator by also substituting a very large num-
ber for infinity. 
® Division by zero is prohibited. At circuit resonance, a zero divisor 
and a zero dividend will be presented. The division of zero by zero 
is always prohibited.

Procedu re Method 
1. Convert each parallel circuit to polar form impedances us-
ing ZPOLAR, parallel circuit formulas. 
2. Convert each polar impedance to equivalent series resistance 
and reactance from: 
Rs = Z cos 8z 
±Xs = Z sin(±8z) 
[If your calculator has the polar to rectangular conversion 
feature (P-R), enter ZPOLAR as the polar coordinates. The 
calculator x axis output is Rs and the calculator y axis out-
put is ±Xs] 
3. Sum all Rs quantities and algebraically sum all ±Xs 
quantities. 
[If your calculator has multiple memories, sum all Rs 
quantities into one memory and all ±Xs quantities into a 
second memory.] 
4. Convert the total equivalent series resistance and the total 
equivalent series reactance to total polar impedance from: 
Zt = V(Rs); + (±Xs); 
(±8z)t = tan-1 [(±Xs)t/(Rs)t] 
[If your calculator has the rectangular to polar conversion 
feature (R-P), enter (Rs)t as the x coordinate and (±Xs)t 
as the y coordinate. Calculator output will be polar im-
pedance coordinates]

1. Convert each series circuit to polar form impedance using 
ZPOLAR, series circuit formulas. 
2. Convert each polar impedance to equivalent parallel recipro-
cal resistance and equivalent parallel reciprocal reactance. 
[Note: parallel reciprocal resistance is also known as con-
ductance (G) and parallel reciprocal reactance is also 
known as susceptance (B)] 
Rj;l = G = Z-l cos 8z 
±Xj;l = ±B = Z-l sin(±8z) 
[If your calculator has the polar to rectangular conversion 
feature, enter Z-l and ±8 z as the polar coordinates. The 
calculator x coordinate output is Rj;l or G and the calcu-
lator y coordinate output is ±Xj;l or ±B.] 
3. Sum all Rj;l (G) quantities and algebraically sum all ±Xj;l 
(±B) quantities. 
[If your calculator has multiple memories, sum all Rj;l 
(G) quantities into one memory and sum all ±Xj;l (±B) 
quantities into a second memory.] 
4. Convert the total equivalent parallel reciprocal resistance 
[(Rj;l)t or Gt] and the total equivalent parallel reciprocal 
reactance [(±Xj;l)t or ±Bt] to total polar impedance from: 
Zt = l/vG; + (±Bt)2 
(±8z)t = tan-1 [±Bt/Gt] 
[If your calculator has the rectangular to polar conversion 
feature (R-P), enter Gt as the x coordinate and ±Bt as the y

Notes 
1. This handbook contains no circuit elements to ZRECT direct 
formulas. It is intended that all simple circuits should be 
converted to polar impedance and then converted as neces-
sary to and from ZRECT and [ZRECTrl . 
2. The author apologizes to readers with good working knowl-
edge of YRECT for the use of [ZRECTr1 , however YRECT 
is a necessary part of this section, [ZRECT r 1 fits the format 
better and many engineers as well as most technicians are 
very uncomfortable with Y RECT' 
3. The use of [ZpOLARrl or YPOLAR is not recommended. 
Do not confuse yourself or others by continually changing 
the signs of the angles. Convert directly from ZPOLAR to 
YRECT' 
4. Use the rectangular forms Rs + (±Xs)j and G - (±B)j as 
shown and do not simplify. The plus sign will identify the 
complex quantity as impedance or voltage and as a series 
equivalent quantity while the minus sign identifies the com-
plex quantity as reciprocal impedance, admittance or cur-
rent and also as a parallel equivalent quantity. Note also that 
in this form the sign of the reactive quantity within the 
parentheses is real and does not change during inversions. 
This maintains identification of the reactive quantity as in-
ductive (+) or as capacitive (-) at all times. 
5. If any reader is uncomfortable with all rectangular quan-
tities, direct conversion of series resistive and series reactive 
quantities to equivalent parallel reciprocal resistive and re-
ciprocal reactive quantities is recommended. This conversion 
and its reverse allows the Simplification of any series, parallel 
or series-parallel combination of impedances to a single 
impedance. This method is as fast as any other and there is 
less chance of error.

VA-I Impedance is a complex quantity requiring the mathematical 
operation of addition and subtraction to be performed in rec-
tangular form while multiplication and division operations are 
usually performed in polar form by treating the phase angle as an 
exponent. Impedances in rectangular form may be multiplied 
like other binomials, division however requires the divisor to be 
rationalized by mUltiplying the divisor and the dividend by the 
conjugate of the divisor (the conjugate of Rs + XJ = Rs - XJ). 
To eliminate this lengthy calculation, it is recommended that all 
multiplication and division be performed in polar form.

Definitions 
Note: Phi (tP) and other greek letters are also used as symbols for 
phase angle. 
8 = 1. The angular difference in phase between a quantity and 
a reference. 
2. The phase angle of voltage, current, impedance or ad-
mittance with respect to a reference. 
3. The phase angle of voltage, current, impedance or ad-
mittance with respect to the phase angle of current, 
voltage, resistance or conductance. 
4. The phase angle of voltage or impedance with respect 
to the phase angle of total current or with respect to 0°. 
S. The phase angle of current or admittance with respect 
to the phase angle of total voltage or with respect to 0° .

I' = 60" (seconds) 
3. Radians 
21T radians = one cycle or one revolution 
4. Grads

8 = 0° when voltage and current are in phase. 0° when circuit 
is or acts as a pure resistance or conductance. 
8 = ±9Q0 when circuit is or acts as a pure reactance or suscep-
tance.

Phase Angle 
Definitions 
+0 = Leading phase angle. Counterclockwise rotation of a 
vector. Earlier in time than 0° . 
-0 = Lagging phase angle. Clockwise rotation of a vector. 
Later in time than 0° . 
OE = 1. The difference in phase between the total voltage 
and the total current when the phase angle of the 
total current is placed at 0° . 
2. The angular difference in phase between the total 
voltage and the current source. (Ig = Ig /0° = +Ig 
unless noted) 
OEo = Output voltage phase with respect to the phase of the 
voltage or current input. (Voltage or current generator 
Eg or Ig = 0°) 
01 = 1. The angular difference in phase between the total 
current and the total voltage when the phase angle of 
the total voltage is placed at 0° . 
2. The angular difference in phase between the total 
current and the voltage source. (Eg = Eg 1st.... = +Eg 
unless noted) 
010 = Output current phase with respect to the phase of the 
voltage or current input. (Input phase = 0° unless noted) 
Page Note: The phase angles of E and I may be confusing. To prevent 
confusion, always calculate polar impedance fIrst and then assign zero 
degrees to the signal source. If the signal source is a voltage generator, 
01 = -0 z and if the signal source is a current generator, OE = 0 z. Use 
vector algebra to determine the phase angles of circuit voltages and/or 
currents. e.g., when a voltage source is connected to a series circuit, 
01 = -0 z, 0 E R = 0 f, 0 E L = 0 I + 90° , 0 E c = 0 I - 90° , 0 E t = 0° .

Definitions 
8y = 1. The angular difference between the admittance and 
the conductance of a circuit. (The angle of conduc-
tance G = 0°) 
2. The same angle as impedance except with opposite 
sign. 
3. The same angle as the phase angle of the total cur-
rent when the phase angle of total voltage is placed 
at 0°. 
o z = 1. The angular difference between the impedance and 
the resistance of a circuit. (The angle of resistance 
R= 0°) 
2. The same angle as the admittance except with oppo-
site sign. 
3. The same angle as the phase angle of the total volt-
age when the phase angle of total current is placed 
at 0°.

±8E = -(±8I) = -(±8y ) = ±OZ in all two terminal networks 
where the phase angle of either the total voltage or the 
total current is placed at 0°. (It should be understood 
that reactance, a component of impedance, is the cause 
of the difference in phase between the voltage and the 
current, that OE, 01, Oy and Oz are the same one and 
only phase angle from different reference points, that 
only one may be used at anyone time and that if Z or 
Y ap}(ears as a term in a formula the other term must 
be E 0° or IL!t.)

Symbol 
Definitions 
E = The original symbol for the electric force originally 
known as electromotive force. This force is now known 
as voltage, potential or potential difference. The volt-
age symbol E has been superseded by V for dc tran-
sistor voltages and for all operational amplifier voltages. 
ESfb - (second breakdown energy) See-ISfb 
Note: The tenn second breakdown energy (ES/b) has never been ap-
propriate for static transistor conditions since continuous power at any 
level converts to infinite energy.

hFE = [(IE/Ie) - lr1 
hFE(INV) = Seldom used hFE when collector and emitter leads 
are interchanged.

hNotes: 
The DC counterparts of hfe, hib, hob, hoc, hoe, hrb, hre• and hre are 
very seldom used. 
hFE usually has a different value than hfe measured under the same

IS/b = Symbol for second breakdown current. 
IS/b = The collector current at which second breakdown occurs 
at a specified collector voltage, case or junction temper-
ature and pulse duration. 
Second breakdown occurs when the combination of 
voltage, current, temperature, time and a current con-
striction within the transistor produces spot heating suf-
ficient to thermally maintain or increase the collector 
current regardless of base bias. In the usual transistor 
circuit, if second breakdown has been allowed to occur, 
transistor failure will also occur due to excessive spot 
junction temperature. 
Second breakdown is not the same as thermal failure 
where failure may be predicted from low voltage ther-
mal resistance calculations. Second breakdown may 
occur at positive, zero, or negative base bias. 
Circuit design should be such that the manufacturers 
second breakdown specifications are not exceeded 
under worst case conditions. Alternately, the second 
breakdown characteristics of transistors may be mea-
sured with special non-destructive procedures.

dB 
Editorial 
The decibel (dB) has a long history of use as a voltage or cur-
rent ratio regardless of the original, and still the only com-
pletely unqualified, definition of the term as a power ratio. 
The lack of an official sanction for the use of the decibel as a 
voltage or current ratio has created the ridiculous situation 
where, input and output resistances are "assumed" to be equal 
when it is known that large differences exist, specifications use 
mV/V, mV/V, V/V, V/mV and dBV for voltage ratios, and the 
same engineer who uses the decibel for voltage ratios on a 
daily basis, switches to a "more technically correct" form when 
writing a specification or a paper. (Some opamp manufacturers 
do specify certain voltage ratios in decibels) 
The time has arrived for the official definition of the decibel 
to be expanded to include voltage and current ratios. There 
can be absolutely no misunderstanding of the expanded defini-
tion as long as the decibel is stated as a power, voltage or cur-
rent ratio, so you may start using this very useful tool now, 
without waiting for an official definition. 
There will be a few ultra conservatives who will insist that the 
decibel can only be used correctly as a power ratio but they 
will be a very small minority. Some of this same group will 
insist that the word gain means only power and although 
completely understandable the use of the term "voltage gain" 
is technically incorrect. 
The use of any of the words gain, amplification or decibels 
without reference to power, voltage or current is not recom-
mended since all three would have to be interpreted as power 
in the absence of an adjective.

Total 
Noise Voltage 
V ni = Total equivalent input rms noise voltage including: 
1. Device equivalent input noise voltage (V n) 
2. The product of the device equivalent input noise cur-
rent (In) and the sum of the effective source resis-
tances at both inputs. 
3. The thermal noise voltage (VnR) of the effective 
source resistances at both inputs. 
Note: All three noise voltages have components of l/f noise as 
well as constant spectral density (white) noise. The device white 
noise component is shot noise and the white noise of resistance 
is thermal noise. The l/f noise of resistances is excess noise or 
current noise. White noise voltage may be easily calculated from 
a spot noise voltage by multiplying by the square root of the 
noise bandwidth but l/f noise or noise having a significant l/f 
noise component must be averaged over the total bandwidth by 
the rms method. l/f noise is usually neglected at frequencies 
above 1 kHz and is often assumed to have straight line response 
between the 100 Hz and 1 KHz spot noise measurement points.

@ When supply voltage connections are not shown, a split supply is as-
sumed with Vee positive with respect to common (ground) and 
VEE negative with respect to common (ground). 
@ Low gain Butterworth or Bessel response VCVS fJIters are relatively 
insensitive to value changes except for the cutoff frequency. 5% 
tolerance resistors and 10% tolerance capacitors are recommended 
for most applications. 
@> Free gain Butterworth VCVS fJIters may be empirically determined 
by simultaneously adjusting the gain just under that which produces 
a slight hump while adjusting R1, R2, C1 and/or C2 for the proper 
3 dB down frequency.

APPENDIX B 
ElECTRONICS TERMS AND THEIR SYMBOLS 
This is an alphabetical listing of passive, bipolar-transistor and 
operational-amplifier (opamp) linear-circuit electronics terms 
with their corresponding symbols. Included also, are selected 
electronic, magnetic, acoustic, electrical, mechanical, mathe-
matical and physical terms with their corresponding symbol, 
abbreviation, sign or acronym. 
An attempt has been made to include present common usage 
(USA), traditional and recognized standard symbols, however, 
the preferred symbol (listed last) is often the author's projection 
of present trend, personal preference or arbitrary selection and 
does not necessarily represent an accepted industry standard. 
This listing is intended as a reference source of electronics 
symbols, but may also be used to locate formulas having un-
familiar resultant symbols. It should be noted, however, that 
several different symbols may be shown for a given term and 
that the last-listed symbol is not always the one used in the 
formula and definition sections, since the last-listed symbol 
may be the author's projection of present trend. 
Textbooks and scientific journals conventionally use italic 
(slanted) type for quantity symbols, however, this handbook 
follows the example of almost all technical manuals where 
roman (upright) type is used for both quantity and unit sym-
bols. Unit symbols are clearly indicated as such in this appendix. 
Common electronics abbreviations should be written without 
periods and generally in lower case letters as listed, however, 
certain abbreviations are capitalized and certain others are 
capitalized when used as a noun. 
An asterisk is used to indicate schematic letter symbols. 
No attempt has been made to include terms or symbols as-
sociated with computing systems, control systems, digital sys-
tems, digital devices, non-linear circuits, non-linear devices, 
vacuum tubes or field effect transistors.
