      including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
      source, and configuration files. 
 
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
      and conversions to other media types. 
 
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
 
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
 
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

License Agreements 
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
 
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
      subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
 
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
 
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
      as of the date such litigation is filed. 
 
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
      meet the following conditions: 
 
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
 
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
          stating that You changed the files; and 
 
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
          the Derivative Works; and 
 
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
6 
License Agreements 
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
          as modifying the License. 
 
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
      the conditions stated in this License. 
 
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
 
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
 
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
 
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
 
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL 
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND

License 
 
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. 
 
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO 
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS 
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS. 
 
1. Definitions 
 
   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology 
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along 
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
8 
License Agreements 
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as 
defined below) for the purposes of this License. 
   2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and 
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, 
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art 
reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work 
may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a 
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of 
this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical 
composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-
relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative 
Work for the purpose of this License. 
   3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under 
the terms of this License. 
   4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. 
   5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the 
terms of this License. 
   6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this 
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with 
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor 
to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 
 
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or 
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on 
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other 
applicable laws. 
 
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, 
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise 
the rights in the Work as stated below: 
 
   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective 
Works; 
   2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 
   3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform 
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the 
Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; 
   4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform 
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission 
Derivative Works. 
   5. 
 
      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: 
         1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights 
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or 
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. 
         2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency 
or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord 
You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the 
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or 
the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
9 
License Agreements 
   6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, 
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to 
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. 
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) 
of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 
 
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known 
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such 
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other 
media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby 
reserved. 
 
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 
 
   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must 
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with 
every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose 
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense 
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to 
the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the 
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor 
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any 
credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative 
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as 
requested. 
   2. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You 
must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable 
to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author 
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author 
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, 
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, 
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or 
parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably 
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies 
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a 
Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative 
Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be 
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of 
a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear 
where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least 
as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 
 
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
10 
License Agreements 
 
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND 
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER 
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT 
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
 
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, 
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT 
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
7. Termination 
 
   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. 
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective 
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses 
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance 
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any 
termination of this License. 
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this 
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full 
force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 
 
8. Miscellaneous

Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work 
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this

representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall

<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. </p>

License Agreements 
<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS 
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS. </p> 
 
 
<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p> 
 
<ol type="a"> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, 
anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified 
form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and 
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A 
work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative 
Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon 
the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical 
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound 
recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in 
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work 
that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work 
for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work 
is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work 
in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the 
Work under the terms of this License. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who created 
the Work. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered 
under the terms of this License. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
<strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under 
this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with 
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor 
to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 
 
</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended 
to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

License Agreements 
other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under 
copyright law or other applicable laws. </p> 
 
 
<p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-
exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license 
to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p> 
 
 
<ol type="a"> 
<li> 
 
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective 
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 
</li> 
 
<li> 
to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 
</li> 
 
<li> 
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, 
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work 
including as incorporated in Collective Works; 
 
</li> 
 
<li> 
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, 
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative 
Works. 
</li> 
 
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical 
composition:</p> 
 
<ol type="i"> 
<li><strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses</strong>. Licensor 
waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a 
performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public 
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.</li> 
 
<li><strong>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor 
waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music 
rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any 
phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, 
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US 
Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li></ol></li> 
 
<li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the 
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights 
society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance 
(e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other 
jurisdictions).</li>

15 
License Agreements 
 
</ol> 
 
 
<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now 
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such 
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other 
media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby 
reserved.</p> 
 
<p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is 
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p> 
 
 
<ol type="a"> 
<li> 
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a 
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy 
or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly 
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms 
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense 
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to 
the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the 
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor 
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any 
credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative 
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as 
requested. 
</li> 
 
 
<li> 
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep 
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the 
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or 
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author 
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, 
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, 
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or 
parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably 
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies 
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a 
Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative 
Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be 
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of 
a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
16 
License Agreements 
where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least 
as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 
</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p> 
 
<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND 
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER 
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT 
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> 
 
 
<p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL 
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p> 
 
<p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p> 
 
<ol type="a"> 
 
<li> 
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities 
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this 
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such 
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. 
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this 
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full 
force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work 
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this 
License.

<li> 
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, 
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same 
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

<li> 
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of 
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this 
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary 
to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
</li> 
 
<li> 
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by 
the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

<li> 
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or 
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall 
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual 
written agreement of the Licensor and You.

      Academic Free License v. 2.1 
      ============================ 
 
      Copyright (c) 2005 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved. 
 
      This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work 
of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed 
the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the 
Original Work: 
 
      Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1 
 
      1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the 
following: 
 
      a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies; 
 
      b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the 
Original Work; 
 
      c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to 
the public; 
 
      d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and 
 
      e) to display the Original Work publicly. 
 
      2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent 
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original 
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the 
Original Work and Derivative Works. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
19 
License Agreements 
      3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the 
preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all 
available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor 
hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the 
Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor 
distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by 
placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information 
repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access 
by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and 
by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice 
immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. 
 
      4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor 
the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their 
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products 
derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of 
the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to 
trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual 
property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is 
granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims 
other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to 
the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original 
Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from 
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that 
Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 
 
      5) This section intentionally omitted. 
 
      6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any 
Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices 
from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of 
licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution 
Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You 
create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to 
inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. 
 
      7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants 
that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted 
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under 
the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those 
copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately 
proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an 
"AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, 
without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE 
ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an 
essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted 
hereunder except under this disclaimer. 
 
      8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall 
the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of 
this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, 
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, 
or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of 
liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
20 
License Agreements 
from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such 
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not 
apply to You. 
 
      9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original 
Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the 
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this 
License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between 
Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon 
the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 
herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or 
another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited 
by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by 
international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to 
You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all 
of its terms and conditions. 
 
      10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate 
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You 
by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-
claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the 
Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply 
for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original 
Work with other software or hardware. 
 
      11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating 
to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein 
the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and 
under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original 
Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be 
subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 
U.S.C. ¤ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and 
international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this 
License. 
 
      12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License 
or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled 
to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable 
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including 
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this 
License. 
 
      13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. 
 
      14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, 
whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity 
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this 
License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this 
definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or

24 
License Agreements 
      <li> 
      <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical 
issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in 
unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting 
separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective 
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a 
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. 
      </li> 
 
      <li> 
      <strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or 
upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical 
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound 
recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in 
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work 
that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work 
for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work 
is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work 
in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li> 
 
      <li> 
      <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers 
the Work under the terms of this License. 
      </li>

      <strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who 
created the Work.

      <li> 
      <strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship 
offered under the terms of this License.

with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the 
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

      <p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is 
intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, 
first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright 
owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p> 
 
 
      <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-
free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) 
license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p>

hereby reserved.</p> 
 
      <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 
above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 
</p> 
 
 
      <ol type="a"> 
      <li> 
      You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must 
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with 
every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose 
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense 
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to 
the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the 
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor 
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any 
credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative 
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as 
requested. 
      </li> 
 
 
      <li> 
      If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You 
must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable 
to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author 
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author 
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, 
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, 
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or 
parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably 
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies 
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a 
Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative 
Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be 
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of 
a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear 
where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least 
as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 
 
Version 2, June 1991 
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.   
 
 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
29 
License Agreements 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
30 
License Agreements 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
 
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
31 
License Agreements 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
32 
License Agreements 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make

exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.

License Agreements 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the 
mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the 
Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors 
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can 
do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must tell them their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under 
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any 
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the 
Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
36 
License Agreements 
recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with 
the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 
above, provided that you also do the following: 
 
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change; and 
 
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without 
modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the 
terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant 
warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option). 
 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this General Public License. 
 
d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its 
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring 
the other work under the scope of these terms. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
 
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of 
distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source 
code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
 
c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the 
corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form alone.) 
 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it 
need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that 
accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for 
standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating 
system. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
37 
License Agreements 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program 
except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use 
copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their 
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on 
the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all 
its terms and conditions. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. 
 
7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 
Version 2.1, February 1999 
 
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the 
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version 
number 2.1.] 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make 
sure the software is free for all its users. 
 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
40 
License Agreements 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want 
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free 
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the library or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link 
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms 
so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library. 
 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone 
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be 
affected by problems that might be introduced by others. 
 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version 
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in 
this license. 
 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. 
 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its 
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax 
criteria for linking other code with the library. 
 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It 
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the 
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
41 
License Agreements 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
Public License. 
 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables 
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its 
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. 
 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
modified version of the Library. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in 
order to run. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so 
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
those functions and data) to form executables. 
 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to 
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) 
 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
library. 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program 
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library 
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
42 
License Agreements 
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses 
the Library does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 
 
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License. 
 
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
part of its purpose remains meaningful. 
 
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used 
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Library. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
43 
License Agreements 
 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
make any other change in these notices. 
 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, 
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
and derivative works made from that copy. 
 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library. 
 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange. 
 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but 
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License. 
 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions 
of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable 
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution 
of such executables. 
 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if 
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law. 
 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
44 
License Agreements 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are 
linked directly with the Library itself. 
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's 
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 
 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library 
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this 
License. Also, you must do one of these things: 
 
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user 
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able 
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) 
 
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
 
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. 
 
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
materials from the same place. 
 
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or 
that you have already sent this user a copy. 
 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable. 
 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
together in an executable that you distribute. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
45 
License Agreements 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided 
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the 
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do 
these two things: 
 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above. 
 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of 
it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance. 
 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 
 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 
 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
46 
License Agreements 
software distribution system which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 
 
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under 
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General 
Public License). 
 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
49 
License Agreements 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
50 
License Agreements 
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
 
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
51 
License Agreements 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

License Agreements 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.

information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free 
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; 
type `show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-
clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
55 
License Agreements 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
56 
License Agreements 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
 
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
57 
License Agreements 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

License Agreements 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.

information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free 
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-
clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

License Agreements 
     Contributions or its Contributor Version. 
 . 
 2.2. Effective Date 
 . 
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution 
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first 
 distributes such Contribution. 
 . 
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope 
 . 
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under 
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the 
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. 
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a 
 Contributor: 
 . 
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; 
     or 
 . 
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's 
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its 
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor 
     Version); or 
 . 
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of 
     its Contributions. 
 . 
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, 
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with 
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 
 . 
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses 
 . 
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to 
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this 
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if 
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 
 . 
 2.5. Representation

 3. Responsibilities 
 ------------------- 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
64 
License Agreements 
 . 
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form 
 . 
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any 
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under 
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source 
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this 
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not 
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code 
 Form. 
 . 
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form 
 . 
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: 
 . 
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code 
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of 
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code 
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more 
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and 
 . 
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this 
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the 
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter 
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 
 . 
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work 
 . 
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, 
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for 
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered 
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the 
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this 
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software 
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of 
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered 
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary 
 License(s). 
 . 
 3.4. Notices 
 . 
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices 
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, 
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of 
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to 
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 
 . 
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms 
 . 
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any 
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by 
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any 
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
65 
License Agreements 
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any 
 jurisdiction. 
 . 
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 
 --------------------------------------------------- 
 . 
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to 
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered 
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a 
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
 . 
 5. Termination 
 -------------- 
 . 
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically 
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become 
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular 
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such 
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an 
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the 
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have 
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular 
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor 
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the 
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License 
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after 
 Your receipt of the notice. 
 . 
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent 
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, 
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version 
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to 
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 
 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 
 . 
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all 
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which 
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License 
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

 8. Litigation 
 ------------- 
 . 
 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the 
 courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal 
 place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that 
 jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. 
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring 
 cross-claims or counter-claims. 
 . 
 9. Miscellaneous 
 ---------------- 
 . 
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject 
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
 necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides 
 that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 
 . 
 10. Versions of the License 
 --------------------------- 
 . 
 10.1. New Versions 
 . 
 Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 
 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 
 
Version 2, June 1991 
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.   
 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
68 
License Agreements 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
69 
License Agreements 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
 
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
70 
License Agreements 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the

Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
72 
License Agreements 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. 
Copyright (C) yyyy name of author 
 
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version. 
 
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
details.

Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add 
information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free 
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; 
type `show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-
clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Introduction 
============ 
 
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; 
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, 
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the 
  FreeType Project. 
 
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and 
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license 
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, 
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least. 
 
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG 
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion 
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products 
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that: 
 
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be 
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) 
 
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or 
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) 
 
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use 
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge 
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the 
      FreeType code. (`credits') 
 
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this 
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. 
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and 
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. 
 
 
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a 
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus 
  encourage you to use the following text:

Legal Terms 
=========== 
 
0. Definitions 
-------------- 
 
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project', 
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally 
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and 
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, 
  beta or final release. 
 
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where 
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source 
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'. 
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType 
  engine'. 
 
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original 
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and 
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its 
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive. 
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by 
  this license, you must contact us to verify this. 
 
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner, 
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as 
  specified below. 
 
1. No Warranty 
-------------- 
 
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY 
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO, 
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR 
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO 
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. 
 
2. Redistribution 
----------------- 
 
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and 
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, 
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and 
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code 
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to 
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted 
  herein, subject to the following conditions: 
 
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
76 
License Agreements 
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to 
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying 
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered, 
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source 
      files. 
 
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that 
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the 
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also 
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your 
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory. 
 
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on 
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use 
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid 
  to us. 
 
3. Advertising 
-------------- 
 
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use 
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional 
  purposes without specific prior written permission. 
 
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the 
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation 
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine', 
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'. 
 
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to 
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted 
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the 
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it. 
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType 
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms 
  of this license. 
 
4. Contacts 
----------- 
 
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: 
 
    o freetype@nongnu.org 
 
      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as 
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution. 
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you 
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.   
 
 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

License Agreements 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
 
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
80 
License Agreements 
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
81 
License Agreements 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
82 
License Agreements 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
83 
License Agreements 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. 
Copyright (C) yyyy name of author 
 
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version. 
 
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
details. 
 
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along 
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add 
information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free 
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; 
type `show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-
clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007 
 
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
 
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates 
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public 
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 
 
  0. Additional Definitions.  
 
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU 
General Public License. 
 
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, 
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. 
 
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
of using an interface provided by the Library. 
 
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an 
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library 
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked 
Version". 
 
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the 
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. 
 
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the 
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
86 
License Agreements 
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 
 
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
 
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
 
  2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
 
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
version: 
 
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs 
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or 
 
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
   this License applicable to that copy. 
 
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
 
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from 
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object 
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure 
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates 
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: 
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the 
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
   covered by this License. 
 
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
   document. 
 
  4. Combined Works. 
 
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, 
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the 
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse 
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of 
the following: 
 
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
   covered by this License. 
 
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
   document. 
 
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
87 
License Agreements 
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the 
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
 
   d) Do one of the following: 
 
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this 
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to 
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of 
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the 
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
       Corresponding Source. 
 
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time 
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer 
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version 
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked 
       Version.  
 
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise 
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the 
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is 
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the 
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the 
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If 
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany 
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application 
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation 
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL 
   for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
 
  5. Combined Libraries. 
 
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the 
Library side by side in a single library together with other library 
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your 
choice, if you do both of the following: 
 
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, 
   conveyed under the terms of this License. 
 
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it 
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
 
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
 
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 
 
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
88 
License Agreements 
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" 
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that published version or of any later version 
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is 
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the 
Library.

TRADEMARK: 
 
The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner 
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has 
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995, 
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any 
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized. 
 
OSI CERTIFICATION: 
 
Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is 
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed 
the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7. 
 
EXPORT CONTROL: 
 
The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export 
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because 
it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain 
any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 
734.7(b).

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 
Version 2.1, February 1999 
 
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts 
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence 
 the version number 2.1.] 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make 
sure the software is free for all its users. 
 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want 
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free 
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the library or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link 
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms 
so they know their rights. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

License Agreements 
 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library. 
 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone 
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be 
affected by problems that might be introduced by others. 
 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version 
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in 
this license. 
 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. 
 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its 
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax 
criteria for linking other code with the library. 
 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It 
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the 
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. 
 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
Public License. 
 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables 
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its 
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. 
 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
modified version of the Library.

License Agreements 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in 
order to run. 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so 
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
those functions and data) to form executables. 
 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to 
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) 
 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
library. 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program 
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library 
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether 
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses 
the Library does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
96 
License Agreements 
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to 
all third parties under the terms of this License. 
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table 
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, 
other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must 
make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not 
supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. 
 
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a 
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. 
Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or 
table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not 
supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Library. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
make any other change in these notices. 
 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, 
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
and derivative works made from that copy. 
 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library. 
 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
97 
License Agreements 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but 
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License. 
 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions 
of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable 
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution 
of such executables. 
 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if 
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law. 
 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are 
linked directly with the Library itself. 
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's 
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 
 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library 
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this 
License. Also, you must do one of these things: 
 
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work 
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is 
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
98 
License Agreements 
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able 
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) 
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. 
A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three 
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, 
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. 
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
materials from the same place. 
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or 
that you have already sent this user a copy. 
 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable. 
 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
together in an executable that you distribute. 
 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided 
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the 
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do 
these two things: 
 
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on 
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above. 
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part 
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance. 
 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
99 
License Agreements 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 
 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 
 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. 
 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
100 
License Agreements 
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The 
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in 
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All 
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms. 
 
The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008 
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD 
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android. 
 
The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is 
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license. 
 
The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was 
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public 
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use 
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license. 
 
The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API 
(src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright © 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and 
licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify, 
and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is 
hereby granted. There is no warranty." 
 
The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under 
the standard MIT terms. 
 
The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard 
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted 
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream 
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms. 
 
The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is 
licensed under the standard MIT terms. 
 
The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, 
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed 
under the standard MIT terms. 
 
All other files which have no copyright comments are original works 
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either 
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more 
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files 
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The 
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the 
interest of source tree size. 
 
In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files 
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into 
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit 
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the

Rich Felker 
Richard Pennington 
Stefan Kristiansson 
Szabolcs Nagy 
 
all of whom have explicitly granted such permission. 
 
This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of 
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not 
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it 
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of 
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an 
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

GNU General Public License, version 2, 
with the Classpath Exception 
 
The GNU General Public License (GPL) 
 
Version 2, June 1991 
 
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share 
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose 
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
to 
your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can 
change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

License Agreements 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If 
the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of 
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by 
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all 
of 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
135 
License Agreements 
these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
    that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or 
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to 
be 
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
    this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, 
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute 
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a 
copy 
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
does 
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program 
is 
    not required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate 
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is 
a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
136 
License Agreements 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 
1 
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only 
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
    Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation 
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so 
on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate 
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, 
or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program 
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
137 
License Agreements 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the 
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
that 
choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the 
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar 
in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems 
or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
138 
License Agreements 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of 
software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR 
DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH 
HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to 
attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does. 
 
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the 
Free 
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) 
    any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT 
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for 
    more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
comes 
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free 
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; 
    type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here 
is a sample; alter the names: 
 
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.

"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL 
 
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are 
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but 
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's 
header 
the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the 
"Classpath" 
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this 
code." 
 
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is 
making 
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of 
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination. 
 
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you 
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an 
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, 
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your 
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, 
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent 
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  
If 
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of 
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to 
do 
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

Preamble 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
141 
License Agreements 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share 
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose 
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
to 
your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can 
change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If 
the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
142 
License Agreements 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of 
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by 
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all 
of 
these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
    that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or 
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to 
be 
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
    this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, 
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute 
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a 
copy 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
143 
License Agreements 
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
does 
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program 
is 
    not required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate 
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is 
a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 
1 
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only 
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
    Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation 
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so 
on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate 
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, 
or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program 
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the 
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to 
attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does. 
 
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

WITHOUT 
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when 
it 
starts in an interactive mode:

    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions;

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here 
is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.

    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent 
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  
If

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share 
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose 
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
to 
your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can 
change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
149 
License Agreements 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If 
the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of 
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by 
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
150 
License Agreements 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all 
of 
these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
    that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or 
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to 
be 
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
    this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, 
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute 
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a 
copy 
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
does 
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program 
is 
    not required to print an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate 
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is 
a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
151 
License Agreements 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 
1 
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only 
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
    Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation 
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so 
on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
152 
License Agreements 
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, 
or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program 
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the 
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties to this License. 
 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
that 
choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
153 
License Agreements 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the 
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar 
in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems 
or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of 
software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR 
DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
 
 
 
    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2

License Agreements 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
 
 
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
159 
License Agreements 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
160 
License Agreements 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 

 
 
Alpine Linux Docker Container 9.6.2 
161 
License Agreements 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
 
 
 
    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

License Agreements 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
 
 
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
 
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  
USA 
 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.
