THE MOVING TRIHEDRON*
BY
E. P. LANE
1. Introduction. 
A classical method of studying the metric differential ge-
ometry of curves and surfaces in three-dimensional 
space is based upon the
use of a moving trihedron. 
A trihedron of reference is associated with an
ordinary point of the curve, or surface, under consideration, 
and then the
point is allowed to vary over the whole, or a suitably restricted portion,
thereof. The theory which thus originates is particularly 
powerful in solving
problems concerning two curves, or two surfaces, whose points are in one-to-
one correspondence.
The theory of the moving trihedron in the study of curves, as outlined in
§2 below, is due to Professor G. A. Bliss, who employed it effectively in his
lectures on metric differential geometry at the University of Chicago. It was
later also used by the author, to whom the extension to surfaces in the third
and fourth sections is due. The essentially new feature of the treatment 
both
for curves and for surfaces is found in the recursion formulas upon which the
discussion rests. As these do not seem to have appeared elsewhere in the
literature, 
the following exposition is designed to exhibit them and deduce
some of their consequences.
2. Curves. The method of the moving trihedron as employed in the theory
of curves will now be explained. Let us first of all establish an orthogonal
cartesian coordinate system, which will be designated hereinafter as the fixed
coordinate system. Referred to this system let the parametric equations of a
real proper non-rectilinear 
analytic curve C be
(1) 
x = x(s),   y = y(j),   z = z(j),
the parameter j being the arc length measured from some fixed point to the
ordinary point P(x, y, z) of C. Further, let us consider a point Q whose co-
ordinates X, Y, Z are given as functions of s by equations of the form
(2) 
X = X(s),    F= 
F(j),    Z = Z(s).
If these three functions of s are all constant, the point Q is fixed, relative to
the fixed coordinate system, when the point P varies on the curve C. This
case will be excluded hereinafter, unless the contrary is indicated. Then as j
varies, the point P moves along the curve C, and the point Q traces a curve

Ci represented by the parametric equations (2). The points P, Q of the curves
C, Ci are in one-to-one correspondence, 
corresponding points being those as-
sociated with the same value of the parameter s.
At a point P of a curve C there is the local coordinate system with its origin
at P, with the £-axis along the tangent, the rj-axis along the principal normal,
and the f-axis along the binormal. The equations of transformation 
between
the coordinates X, Y, Z of the point Q that corresponds to P and the local
coordinates £, rj, f of Q are
X = x + c*£ + It, + Xf,
(3) 
Y = y + /3£ + mi, + tf,
Z = z + 7£ + »V + "f,
wherein a, ß, y are the direction cosines, in the fixed coordinate system, of
the tangent; /, m, n are those of the principal normal; and X, p, v those of
the binormal, of the curve C at the point P.
When the point P moves along the curve C, the local trihedron of C at P
also moves, of course, and hence is appropriately 
called the moving trihedron
of the curve C. The local coordinate system associated with the moving tri-
hedron will be designated hereinafter 
as the moving coordinate system. The
local coordinates £, rj, J" of the point Q corresponding to P are themselves func-
tions of i. If these functions are constants, the point Q is rigidly attached to
the moving trihedron, so that the motion of Q relative to the moving tri-
hedron is zero.
For the purpose of investigating 
the relations of the curves C, G, it is
convenient to know the direction cosines of the tangent, principal normal,
and binormal of G referred to the moving trihedron of C. In order to calcu-
late these, some analytical consequences of equations 
(3) will next be de-
duced. If equations (3) are differentiated 
with respect to i, the results can
be reduced, by means of the well known Frenet formulas, to
X' = aAi + IBi + \Ci,
(4) 
Y' = ßAi + mBi + pCi,
Z' = yAi + «Pi + »Ci 
iX' = dX/ds, ■•■),
wherein the coefficients Ai, Bu G are defined by the formulas

It should be observed that An, Bn, Cn are the components in the moving
coordinate system of that vector whose components in the fixed coordinate
system are the derivatives X<-n), F(r,), Z(n). Such a vector may be called a de-
rivative vector. The components A „, Bn, C„ are not themselves actually deriva-
tives, but they behave in some respects like derivatives.
Some additional formulas will now be established. Let us make the con-
vention that the arc length jx of the curve Cx, measured from some fixed point
thereon, shaU be an increasing function of the arc length j of C. Then squar-
ing and adding equations (4), and taking the positive square root, we find

The direction cosines of the tangent, principal normal, and binormal at a
point Q of the curve Cx, referred to the moving trihedron 
of the curve C at
the corresponding point P, can now be found by the familiar equations 
of
transformation 
of direction cosines. For example, the direction cosines of the
tangent of Cx, referred to the fixed coordinate system, are known to be
dX      dY      dZ
(20) 
-, 
   -,-
dji       dji       dji

tangent referred to the moving trihedron are found to be

and in the moving coordinate system are found to be

The direction cosines of the tangent, principal normal, and binormal of the curve
Cx, referred to the moving trihedron of the curve C, are therefore respectively pro-
portional to

Ax, Bx, Cx; L, M, N; P, Q, R.
The general theory just outlined is capable of extensive applications. 
It
forms a powerful tool for the study of curves which are transforms 
of a
given curve, such as involutes, evolutes, parallel curves, and so on. But limi-
tations of space do not permit inclusion of such developments 
here.

3. Surfaces. 
First of all, some preliminary 
formulas in surface theory
will be collected for subsequent 
use. Let us consider a real proper analytic
surface S, not a sphere or a plane, whose parametric 
equations in a fixed co-
ordinate system are
(27) 
x = x(u, v),   y = y(u, v),   z = z(u, v).
Let the lines of curvature be the parametric 
curves on the surface S, so that
(28) 
F = 0,   D' = 0,
in the classical notation of Eisenhart 
and Bianchi. The direction cosines a",
ß", yu of the M-tangent at a point P(a;, y, z) of 5 are given by the formulas

of S at P are given

/ t-i/-i\ 
i/o 
/ n/i\ 
i /o

(PG) 1/2
The curvilinear parametric 
equations of any curve C through the point P
on the surface S are
(32) 
u = u(s),   v = v(s),
the parameter 
i being the arc length measured from some fixed point of C.
The direction cosines a, ß, y of the tangent of C at P are expressed by the
formulas
(33) 
a = Xuu' + xvv',   ß = yuu' + yvv',   y = zuu' + zvv'   (u' = du/ds, 
■ • ■ ).
Let 9 be the angle from the positive half of the w-tangent to the positive half
of the tangent of the curve C at the point P. Then one has
(34) 
cos d = E"2u',    sin 6 = Gll2v'.
The principal normal curvatures 
1/Pi, I/P2 of the surface 5 are given by
the formulas

and 2 that with the o-curve, at a point P.
Formulas analogous to the Frenet formulas can be established for the
local trihedron whose edges are the tangents of the Unes of curvature 
and
the normal at a point P of a surface S. These formulas express the derivatives,
with respect to the arc length j of a curve C, of the direction cosines of the
three edges of the local trihedron linearly in terms of these cosines themselves,
the coefficients depending upon the functions 6, Rx, R2, rx, r2. In fact, actual
calculation, 
the details of which will be omitted, leads to the formulas in
question, namely,

With these should be

x' = cos 8 au + sin 0av,
with similar expressions for y', z'.
Let us establish a local coordinate system at a point P of a surface S,
referred to its lines of curvature, 
with the origin at P, the £-axis along the
»-tangent, the 77-axis along the D-tangent, and the f-axis along the normal of
S at P. The equations of transformation 
between the coordinates X, Y, Z
oí any point Q (supposed to be functions of u, v, and referred to the fixed co-
ordinate system) and the local coordinates £, 77, $" of Q are
X = x + a"£ + avr¡ + af,

Y = y + 0»£ + ß'r, + H,
Z = z + 7U£ + yv-o + cÇ.
Recursion formulas exactly analogous to those in §1 can be obtained by re-
peated differentiation 
of these equations. Differentiating 
once with respect
to the arc length j of the curve C we find, by means of (37), (38),

With the definitions of the functions An, B„, Cn employed in this section,
the formulas (12), • • • , (26) of §2 can easily be shown to be equally valid
for the local trihedron of surface theory. One thus obtains a theory differing

704 
E. P. LANE 
[July
from that of §2 only in two particulars; 
namely, the curve C is now supposed
to lie on a given surface; and a different local trihedron 
is now being asso-
ciated with the curve C. These considerations 
will not be pursued further
here.
The principal interest in the theory of the moving trihedron in surface
theory arises when the point P, instead of tracing a curve C on the surface S,
is allowed to vary over a suitably restricted region of S. In this case the local
components of the partial derivative vectors are required. These may be ob-
tained by specializing equations (37), (38), and (40), • • • , (45), if it is kept
in mind that
(46) 
dj" = &i*du,   ds" = Gl'2dv,
where ju, j" denote arc lengths on the parametric 
curves. The required formu-
las can also be calculated directly. Either way one finds
(47) 
Xu = Aua" + B"av + Cua,    Xv = Ava" + Bva" + Cva,
and similar formulas for the first partial derivatives of F, Z, where the coeffi-

The calculation of the local components of derivative vectors of higher order
than the second is now purely mechanical, 
but none of them will be used
hereinafter, and recursion formulas for the local components of the derivative
vectors of the »th order need not be written.
Let us suppose for the present that the locus of the point Q, when u, v
vary, is a proper surface Si, and let the six fundamental 
coefficients and other
functions for this surface be indicated by subscripts 1. For the first three funda-
mental coefficients we find, by easy calculations from equations (47),

Since the six fundamental 
coefficients for the surface Si have been cal-
culated, it is only a formal matter to write the expressions for the mean and
total curvatures, the equation of the lines of curvature, etc., for the surface
Si in terms of the components Au, ■ • ■ ,AVV,  • '••'.
4. Applications. Some applications of the theory of the moving trihedron
in the theory of surfaces, as explained in the preceding section, will now en-
gage our attention. 
First of all, equations (47) and the similar equations for
Y, Z show that the point Qi/X, Y, Z) is fixed relative to the fixed coordinate
system if, and only if,
A- = P« = C- = A" = P" = C = 0.
Equations 
(48) now yield necessary and sufficient conditions that the point Q
be fixed relative to the fixed coordinate system, namely,
{._£U.(_1 + 7 + l),    {--G'"(7>
m ,.-*><•(-1), 
-c'"(-17t3'
'-*"(-D       f--G,"(-0
These conditions are very useful in solving envelope problems of a type which
will now be described. Let us consider a surface S referred to its Unes of curva-
ture, and a two-parameter 
family of surfaces such that one of them, Si, is
associated with each point P of S. Let the equation of Si be
/(£, V, i, u, v) = 0,
in which |, v, f are local coordinates referred to the moving trihedron of 5

1934] 
THE MOVING TRIHEDRON 
707
at P, and u, v are the curvilinear coordinates of P. It may be required to find
the envelope of the surface Sx when the point P describes a curve or a region
of the surface S. The usual method of investigating 
the envelope entails the
differentiation 
of the functions £, 77, f with respect to u and v, and it will next
be shown that the conditions (57) are precisely the needed formulas for the
differentiation of local point coordinates. For this purpose, let us observe that
the result of solving equations (39) for £, 77, f is
£ = a'iX -x)+ 
ß"(Y -y)+ 
7"(Z - z),
(58) 
r, = a°(X-x)+ß>(Y-y)+y°(Z-z),
t = a(X-x)+ 
b(Y -y)+ 
ciZ - z).
Consequently the equation of the surface Sx referred to the fixed coordinate
system can be written in the form
f(lZ<xHX-x),    2>(X-*),     X>(X - x), u, t>)= 0,
the summation 
being for cyclical permutations. 
Since u, v occur explicitly
and also in au, a", a, x, ■ ■ ■ , but not in X, Y, Z, partial differentiation 
yields
(59) 
/f£»+/,^+/ffu+/» 
= 0,
htv+h-ov+frtv+f* 
= 0,
where the partial derivatives of £, r?, f are to be calculated from equations
(58) by direct differentiation with X, Y, Z fixed. If use is made of equations
(37), suitably speciaUzed, to obtain the partial derivatives 
of a", a", a, • ■ ■
as linear combinations of a", av, a, • • ■ , and if equations (58) themselves
are then employed to express the derivatives of £, 77, f as functions of £, 77, f,
the result of the differentiation 
can be reduced to equations (57), as was to
be shown.
By way of iUustration let us consider the osculating plane of the »-curve
at the point P of the surface S. If the equation of this plane, referred to the
fixed coordinate system, is written in the usual form, the equations of trans-
formation (39) and the equations (29) together with the equations obtained
by differentiating 
the latter with respect to u can be used to show that the
local equation of the osculating plane of the u-curve is

If this equation is differentiated with respect to v, the result can be reduced
by means of one of the conditions of Codazzi, namely,

provided that the surface 5 is not developable. Equations 
(60), (62) taken
together are the equations of the characteristic 
of the osculating plane of the
«-curve when v varies. The equations of the orthogonal 
projection 
of this
characteristic 
onto the tangent plane are
m       f.„,i_i

Since the equations of the ray of the lines of curvature, namely, the straight
line joining the Laplace transformed 
points or ray-points (0, rx, 0) and (—r2,
0,0), are

it follows that the orthogonal projection of the characteristic of the osculating
plane of the u-curve, when v varies, onto the tangent plane coincides with the ray

Differentiation 
of equation (62) would enable us to find the edge of regression
of the developable enveloped by the osculating plane of the »-curve when v
varies.
The equation of the rectifying plane of the u-curve at the point P can easily
be shown to be
(66) 
-Ü + -L = 0,
rx      Rx
since this plane must contain the tangent 
line, 77 =f = 0, and must be per-
pendicular to the osculating plane (60) of the »-curve. The equations of the
characteristic 
of this plane when v varies can be found by the method just
used for the osculating plane. The equations 
of the orthogonal 
projection
of this line onto the tangent plane turn out to differ from equations (63) only
in that the sign of 77 has been changed. Therefore the projections onto the tangent
plane of the characteristics of the osculating plane and rectifying plane of the

u-curve, when v varies, are symmetrically placed with respect to the tangent line
of the u-curve.
The machinery of the local trihedron can be efficiently used to investigate
the focal surfaces of the congruence of normals of a surface S, and the Laplace
transformed 
nets of the lines of curvature on S, but as the principal results
are well known, this study need not be entered upon here. It may be worthy
of comment, however, that it is easy to locate the centers of the osculating
circle and osculating sphere of the «-curve. Differentiating 
the equation £=0
of the normal plane of the «-curve with respect to u we obtain the equations
of the polar line of the «-curve at the point P, namely,

The polar line meets the surface normal, £ = r, = 0, at the center of the princi-

»-tangent, £=.f=0, 
at the ray-point of the «-curve (0, fi, 0). A second differ-
entiation with respect to u and solution of three simultaneous equations yield
the coordinates of the center of the osculating sphere of the «-curve, namely,

The usual formula for the radius of the osculating sphere, in terms of pi,
rii and their derivatives with respect to the arc length of the «-curve, could
easily be used to write down a condition necessary and sufficient that one
family of lines of curvature, namely, the «-curves, on a surface be spherical.
Similar results can be obtained with the «-curves and »-curves interchanged.

Necessary and sufficient conditions that the surface Si generated by the point
Q may be obtainable from the surface S by a translation can be found in the
following way. In case these surfaces differ only by a translation, 
the differ-
ences X—x, Y—y, Z—z are constants. 
Differentiating 
equations (39) under
this assumption we find the required conditions, namely,
4" = P1'2,       A" = 0,
(70) 
P" = 0, 
P" = G1'2,
C" = 0, 
C = 0.
These conditions are equivalent to the conditions (57) with the modification
that the terms consisting of the number — 1 must be deleted from the paren-
theses in the formulas 
for £u, t,v therein.
