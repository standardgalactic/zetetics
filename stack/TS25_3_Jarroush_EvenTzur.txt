SUMMARY 
 
The presentation of 3D spatial parcels and the development of spatial data visualization 
models play an important role in establishing the future 3D cadastre, which has become one 
of the salient targets of the government's urban activities in most developed countries. 
The method of 3D-spatial parcel registration in the future 3D cadastre dictates the nature, 
characteristics and constraints of 3D visualization of the cadastral parcels. These could assist 
in choosing the most suitable visualization model. 
 
This paper presents a number of alternative models for visualization of 3D spatial parcels in 
the future 3D cadastre. It takes into consideration a number of important practical aspects, 
including: existing 3D cadastral registration methods, 3D spatial topology in the future 3D 
GIS, accuracy of cadastral constraints, effectiveness in establishing a 3D database for 
constructing the 3D spatial parcels, feasibility of the database's application in existing CAD 
software and its effectiveness in building 3D city models in the future cadastre for city 
planning purposes. 
 
The paper proposes a method that has been developed by the authors using Constructive 
Solid Geometry (CSG) for 3D cadastral data visualization. It emphasizes the advantages and 
disadvantages of the CSG model in relation to other models, such as a boundary-
representations model, primitive-instancing models, sweep representations and spatial-
partitioning representation models. The comparison is based on the models' potential for 
visualization of the 3D parcel through a constructive method for founding the 3D future 
cadastre. 
 
The method proposes a special text data format, called ”3DSRV”, based on the CSG model, 
for arranging the cadastral mapping data, in order to edit the future 3D cadastral digital map 
automatically. An important advantage of the ”3DSRV” format is that it can be converted to 
other computers' graphics model formats. Such model formats might be the future 3D GIS 
format. 
 
The method is implemented by writing a macro using AutoCAD Visual Basic for Application 
(VBA) development environment. The macro reads the proposed text data format and 
establishes the 3D cadastral spatial parcels automatically, as well as assisting in generating 
the future 3D registration plan maps.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In the last decade we were witness to an obvious worldwide trend to improve the cadastre 
system, the system responsible for managing countries' real estate. De Soto (1993) explains 
that the main reason for this trend is the role of the cadastre system in enforcing economical 
growth. 
 
While countries around the world are busy transforming their cadastre systems from the 
graphic old system to the modern analytical one, the characteristics of the modern target 
system has been increasing, depending on the rate of acceleration of technological growth. 
The characteristics of the modern system are not satisfied by being a 3D digital high accuracy 
system; it tends to elaborate upon and improve the service standards, which provide for the 
citizens of the country, particularly the engineering population such as architects. 
 
One of the services that manifest themselves by using the 3D data measured and saved in the 
3D cadastral database is the production of 3D-city models. These models ought to be almost 
compulsory in the 3D digital cadastre system, which became a target for the government of 
Israel in 2002, when it funded a "3D-Cadastre" R&D (Research and Development) project. 
One of the R&D projects involved crystallization of a solution for defining and registering 
titles in strata of 3D spatial parcels. 
 
2. PROBLEM DEFINITION 
 
The 3D cadastre system will manage the 3D spatial data in strata in the same way the 2D-GIS 
manage the 2D spatial data currently. This task can be separated into two parts; the first part 
is 3D cadastral data spatial analysis of 3D parcels and 3D objects, and the second part is 3D 
digital visualization as well as 3D city models. 
 
As a basic hypothesis, this task will be performed in the future by a 3D-GIS system that does 
not exist yet. The 3D-GIS system is undergoing intensive research and development efforts at 
this time. The lack of a 3D-GIS system emphasizes the need for an intermediate system 
consisting of existing software such as 2D-GIS. The intermediate system must fulfill minimal 
demands and functions that will be required for managing and visualizing the 3D cadastral 
spatial data. 
 
The main limitations of the 2D-GIS software are weakness in visualization of complex 3D 
objects and the non-existence of 3D topology. The 3D topology issue is considered the basis 
of the future 3D-GIS system model. Hence, the intermediate system which must be designed 
during this decade must not rely on a possible immediate solution for 3D topology, but the 
system database must be planned in such a way that it can permit transformation of its 
database format to the 3D topology future solution format.

On the other hand, in order to overcome the 3D visualization limitation of the 2D-GIS, the 
intermediate system may use CAD software, that specializes in 3D visualization. It is obvious 
that the "intermediate 3D cadastre system" may consist of 2D-GIS and 3D-CAD, such as the 
AutoCAD. 
 
In Israel, surveyors are requested to submit the 2D spatial cadastral data in special ASCII 
format named "SRV" (see http://www.armig.org/srv.html). The main aim of this format is to 
enable transforming the spatial data to a 2D-GIS layer format. Therefore, the main task of 
authors is to establish an ASCII format for saving the 3D cadastral spatial data, in such a way 
that permits two assignments: 
− 
Future data transformation for the 3D topology data format. 
− 
Designing an application for an automatic 3D visualization of the cadastral 3D parcels 
and objects, as well as producing 3D city models. 
 
Saving of the data format depends on the legality of the visualization model. Hence, the role 
of this paper is to develop a suitable visualization model that permits fulfilling the two 
aforementioned tasks in a minimal time period, using existing software that is common in the 
geodetic markets. 
 
3. MODELS FOR VISUALIZATION OF 3D OBJECTS 
 
According to R&D for the "3D Cadastre" project solution, the boundaries of the 3D parcel 
will be defined by delimited primitive solids, while the standards for choosing the primitive 
solids underground will be done by architect engineers in accordance with engineering and 
mechanical criteria. 
 
Spatial sub-parcels will be defined as objects that bind their ownership space (Shushani et al, 
2003).Thus, the visualization model that is suitable for the 3D cadastre according to the 
project solution will be founded on Solid Models. In the literature, five different Solid Models 
can be found: Primitive Instancing, Sweep Presentations, Boundary Representations, Spatial-
Partitioning Representations and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). 
 
3.1 Primitive Instancing (PI) 
 
Geometric Solids are defined by a number of constant parameters. The modeling system 
defines a set of primitive 3D solid shapes that are relevant to the application area. For 
example, one primitive object may be a regular pyramid with a user-defined number of faces 
meeting at apex. 
 
3.2 Sweep Presentations (SWP) 
 
Sweeping an object along a trajectory through space defines a new object called a sweep. A 
trajectory may be defined by a mathematic function or by a 3D spatial polyline. The simplest 
kind of sweep is defined by a 2D area swept along a linear path normal to the plane of the 
area to create a volume (see figure 1.a and 1.b).

a square 
 
3.3 Boundary Representations (b-reps) 
 
Boundary Representations (also known as b-reps) resemble the naïve representations in 
which the object is described in terms of its surface boundaries: vertices, edges and faces. 
Some b-reps are restricted to planar, polygonal boundaries, and may even require faces to be 
convex polygons or triangles. 
This representation of Solid Modeling is very commonplace and is a platform of several 
known representation solid modeling such, as Mesh Models, NURBS Surfaces and so on. 
 
3.4 Spatial-Partitioning Representations (SPRs) 
 
In this model, a solid is decomposed into a collection of adjoining, nonintersecting solids that 
are more primitive than, although not necessarily of the same type as, the original solid. The 
primitive solids may vary in type, size, position, parameterization and orientation, much like 
the different-shaped blocks in a child’s set of blocks. The principle of SPR is a base for other 
known solid modeling geometry such as Binary Space-Partitioning, Spatial-Occupancy 
Enumeration, Cell Decomposition and Octrees.  
 
3.5 Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) 
 
Simple primitives are combined by means of regularized Boolean set operators that are 
included directly in the representation. An object is stored as a tree with operators at the 
internal nodes and simple primitives at the leaves (see figure 2.a and 2.b).

4. DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLID MODEL FOR PRESENTATION Of THE 3D 
CADASTRAL PARCELS AND 3D-SPATIAL CADASTRAL OBJECTS 
 
4.1 The Important 3D Cadastral Representation Model Characteristics 
 
According to the authors’ point of view, there are important characteristics that are ideal for a 
3D geometric model that represents the 3D-spatil cadastral objects.  The seven most 
significant characteristics are: 
a. 
High accuracy level: The ability to represent the measured 3D spatial object without 
distortion. The SPR and the polygonal b-rep methods produce only approximations for many 
objects. Alternatively, the method that supports high-quality graphics is the CSG method, 
with nonpolyhedral primitives and b-reps that allow curved surfaces. Primitive instancing 
also can produce high quality pictures, but does not allow simpler objects to be combined 
with Boolean operators. 
b. 
Flexibility: Flexibility in representing the cadastral objects and very complex ones at 
that. On the one hand, the Primitive Instancing model is limited, since it is  impossible to 
parameterize all objects. Similarly, it is very difficult to reproduce an object with a hole 
inside by b-reps models. The same limitation is relevant for the Sweep Representation model. 
On the other hand, the CSG and SPR models are both able to reproduce very complex 3D 
spatial objects, especially those that are hand made by humans, such like buildings and 
bridges, and require 3D cadastral mapping. 
c. 
Validity: Among all the representations model, b-reps stand out as being the most 
difficult to validate. Not only may vertex, edge and face data structures be inconsistent, but 
faces or edges may also intersect. On the other hand, to validate a CSG tree only simple local 
syntactic checking needs to be done. 
d. 
Closure: Primitives created using primitive instancing cannot be combined at all, and 
simple sweeps are not closed under Boolean operations. Therefore, neither is typically used 
as an internal representation in modeling system. Furthermore, particular b-reps may suffer 
from closure problems under Boolean operations. In most of the cases, these problems can be 
avoided (Foley et al, 1996). 
e. 
Efficiency for 3D cadastral uses: Every representation model could be ideal for 
cadastral representation missions. For example, new cadastral permutations, such as union 
and partitioning, is ideal for representation by using CSG model, whereas using b-reps is 
ideal for finding topology relationships. 
f. 
Calculating 3D topology: Much research is being conducted in this field, as it is the 
main key for establishing the 3D GIS system. Most of the 3D topological models rely on the 
b-reps. However, there is no specific model that has been adopted until this time. Hence, the 
most important character of the representation model that will be used for the “intermediate 
3D cadastral system”, mentioned above, is that the model representation must enable the 
conversion of its data format to other representations' model data formats as easily and 
accurately as possible. The CSG and the SPR models facilitate an accurate and simple 
conversion to all the other representations models. While the same operation in the b-reps 
models is also complex, it is not practicable in most of the cases (Cambray, 1992; Foley et al, 
1996). 
g. 
Implementable by large scale measurements methods. This means that the 
representation models have been used by Photogrammetry and Airborne Laser scanning

technology for automatic 3D spatial object visualization. Haala et al (1998), Frostner (1999), 
Wang and Gruen (1998) and Brenner (1999), present various models of databases that are 
used for constituting 3D City Models by means of Photogrammetry and Airborne Laser 
scanning techniques. Most of the representation techniques are based on the CSG model, 
whereas a few are based on the use of the b-reps. 
 
Of the five models presented above, the two prominent solid models are the CSG model and 
the b-reps model. Although the CSG model does not deal with 3D topology, and this is 
considered the main disadvantage of the model, it defeats the b-reps in the other areas. 
However, the CSG data tree format successfully and simply enables conversion for other 
formats in a simple way, while the same operation, in the b-reps models, is complex and not 
always practicable. 
 
Therefore, the proposed 3D-cadastral representation model was based on the CSG model. 
This model is designed especially for establishing the “Intermediate 3D Cadastral System”, 
which will work during the entire period in which the 3D-GIS system did not exist. 
 
4.2 The Proposed Model 
 
The proposed representation model is based on the CSG model. The primitives that are 
combined by means of regularized Boolean set operators consist of: 
− 
A Cube, which is defined by two points (X, Y and Z) of the diagonal (see figure 3.a). 
− 
A Cylinder, with two ellipses at its base. The cylinder is defined by two points (X, Y 
and Z) and the main axes values of the ellipse (see figure 3.b). The paper deals with the 
circle bases cylinder as a simplification of the general case. 
− 
An Ellipsoid which is defined by a central point and the two axes values. The paper 
deals with a particular case of the ellipsoid where the two axes are equal which is a 
sphere (see figure 3.c). 
− 
A Cone which has an ellipse basis. The cone is defined by the central point of the 
ellipse and its head node point (X, Y and Z) (see figure 3.d). 
− 
A two heads pyramid. The pyramid is defined by six points (see figure 3.e)

These solid primitives are represented by the Primitive-Instancing Solid Representation 
Model. Every complex 3D object may be represented by a combination of the five primitives 
above. However, tremendous effort could be spent by using the Sweep Representation Model 
to represent most of the cadastral objects and 3D buildings. For example, a tunnel can be 
defined by sweeping a normal representative profile, consisting of a 3D polygon, through the 
central 3D Polyline. Additionally, a 3D cadastre requires the conversion of the 2D parcels to 
3D. This issue will be resolved by providing the dimension of volume. The easiest way to 
give the 2D parcel a volume dimension is by sweeping the 2D parcel polygons vertically. 
 
To sum up, the Sweep Representations Model is a vital model for the 3D Cadastral objects 
representations and it will be the sixth “primitive” of the proposed CSG model. These six 
primitives will be combined by means of Boolean and geometrical operators, which are: 
− 
Intersection 
− 
Subtraction 
− 
Union 
− 
Slicing (subtraction of a huge cube from an object) 
 
5. DEVELOPMENT OF ALPHA-NUMERIC  DATA FORMAT FOR SAVING THE 
3D SPATIAL MEASURED DATA – 3DSRV 
 
The proposed alpha-numeric data format, called 3DSRV, may be one of several of formats 
that can fulfill the 3D cadastral “intermediate system”. The data is saved by number set of 
files. The “intermediate system” will use the 3DSRV files for: 
− 
Semi-automatic production and automatic representations of the 3D parcel and the 3D 
sub-parcels of the future 3D cadastre as it is defined by the Israeli R&D “3D-Cadastre” 
project (Shushani et al, 2003). 
− 
Future conversion to the future 3D GIS format. 
− 
Preparation of the 3D Cadastral data for the 2D GIS system which will manage the 3D 
Cadastre in cooperation with a 3D CAD software during the intermediate period. 
− 
3D visualization and 3D City Models executions. 
− 
3D reparcelation planning map preparing. 
 
The 3DSRV files are designed with the same principle of the 2DSRV files format which 
served the SOI (Survey of Israel) till now. The 2DSRV files are three files that are required 
from the licensed surveyor in Israel when he/she submits reparcelation maps for the SOI. 
These 2DSRV three files are used for converting the data to the 2D GIS software as a 
SHAPE files.

The 3DSRV includes the three 2DSRV files which are: 
 
− 
Points.srv, which contains all the point definitions in the project, including their 
coordinates X, Y, H, name and codes. 
− 
Lines.srv, which contains all the fronts and the poly-lines definition, as a combination 
of point names and radius values. 
− 
Parcels.srv, which contains all the 2D parcel definitions, as a combination of line 
names, calculated area and registered area. 
 
With an association of the above three 2DSRV files, the suggested 3DSRV files may include: 
− 
3DSweepObjPolygons.srv: Its target is to save all the 3D polygons in the space of the 
3D Cadastral project which are used to define the 3D objects by using the Sweeping 
Representations Model (all objects that are by Sweep called “SweepBody”): 
 
<OBJPOLYGON> <Polygon name begin with OBP> <Point name1, R1> <Point name2, R2>… <Points 
nameN, RN>; 
 
Tangent line is defined by zero radius value. The last point is combined with first one. All the 
points will be defined in the Points.srv file. 
 
− 
3DSweepPaths.srv: Its target is to define and save all the 3D paths that are used for 
building objects by means of Sweep Representations model. The last point is not 
combined with the first: 
 
<3DSWEEPPATH> <Sweep path name begin with SWP and Number> <Point name1, R1> <Point name2, 
R2>…<Point nameN>; 
 
The last point does not include radius after it. 
 
− 
3DPrimitives.srv: Its target is to define and save all the primitives that will establish the 
future 3D cadastral objects: 
− 
Cube: 
 Object *Cube  (String Point_Name_1, 
String Point_Name_2); 
− 
Cylinder: it has two circle bases. 
 
Object *Cylinder (String Point_Name_1, 
 
String Point_Name_2, 
 
Double R); 
− 
Cone: 
Object *Cone (String Point_Name_1, 
String Point_Name_2,

− 
Sphere:

Double R); 
−

String Sweep Path_Name_1);                                                   And

The record line format is: 
 
<3DPRIMITIVE> <Object Class Name as String> <Object Name as string begin by the two first character of its 
name>\t <Object Definition Order separated by ‘,<space>>; 
 
- 
3DObjects.srv: Its target is to save and define all the Cadastral objects that the 
surveyor had measured during the cadastral mapping. The objects are defined by describing 
the Boolean operators between them. Additionally, it contains the volume for every object. 
The Boolean operators formulas are: 
1. 
A_solid Union B_solid  A_solid + B_solid  
2. 
A_solid Intersection B_solid  A_solid * B_solid 
3. 
A_solid Subtract B_solid  A – B 
4. 
AA_plane Slice A_solid  A_plane / A_solid. AA_plane is defined by three points coordinates, 
y, z in two inverted commas like "x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3".   
 
And the file record line is: 
 
 
<OBJECT> <Object Name as string begin with Ob > <{Set of the Boolean operations using ( ) to specify the 
order of the operations}>  <VOL=><volume in m^3 as double> <CODE1=><Integer 0-255> 
<CODE2=><Integer 0-255> <Date in xx/yy/zzzz format>; 
 
The codes will be used for defining the building types. These set of Boolean formulas, 
actually, defined the CSG Boolean tree. 
 
− 
3DParcels.srv: Its main target is to save and define the cadastral 3D parcels and 3D 
sub-parcels by describing the Boolean formula that builds it. The sub-parcel is called 
SPARCEL and the parcel is called PARCEL. In this file, the 2D regular parcel will 
have a volume by sweeping its polygon vertically up to 12000 meter and down to -1000 
meter. The name of the 3D Parcel or the 3D Sub-Parcel must match its legal name at 
the same way described by the R&D “3D Cadastre” project in Israel. The file record 
line format is: 
 
<3DSPARCEL or  3DPARCEL> <3D Parcel or Sparcel true name> <{Set of the Boolean operations using ( ) to 
specify the order of the operations}> <VOL=><volume in m^3 as double> <PAREA= projected area on the 
plane as double> <Hmax=The maximum height> <Hmin= The minimum height><CODE1=><Integer 0-255> 
<CODE2=><Integer 0-255> <Date in xx/yy/zzzz format>; 
 
By these 3DSRV proposed format, every Geometrical and Cadastral object can be defined 
successfully including objects with holes beside them.

Regarding to the “intermediate 3D cadastral system”, it must have as automatic application 
for converting the 3DSRV format to 2D GIS format, by producing the projection of all the 
3D data to the plane. 
 
6. AN ALGORITHM FOR PRODUCING THE 3D SUB-PARCEL  
 
One of the main tasks of the “intermediate system” is to produce the 3D sub-parcels and 3D 
parcel. The proposed algorithm relies on the 3DSRV that exists in the SOI by the Parcels.srv 
file. The output of the algorithm is the 3DParcels.srv (see figure 4).

7. AN EXPERIMENT OF SYNTHETIC DATA 
 
To demonstrate the 3DSRV files, a tunnel has been designed for sub-way train with a 
underground station. The tunnel was designed under existed buildings in a part of Block Num 
16535, in Israel. Figure 5 illustrates the tunnel design under a cadastre map of the specific

In the file 3Dparcels.src the two 3D sub-parcels are parcel number 12 and 13 (see figures 6 
and 5). By using the AutoCAD2002 software which enables Boolean operators, the two 3D 
sub-parcels could be separated and represented alone (see figure 7). All the sub-parcels that 
have been produced by intersecting the 3D regular parcel with the tunnel and the station 
objects may be united together in order to produce the main 3D parcel of the tunnel. The 
names of the 3D sub-parcels have been taken from the R&D "3D Cadastre" project solution.

8. CONCLUSION 
 
It could be noticed from the synthetic experimentation that the proposed 3DSRV file format 
fulfills the requirements of the R7D “3D Cadastre” solution. The proposed 3D visualization 
model's main advantage is its simplicity. Every surveyor can read and produce them easily. 
The ability to convert the proposed format to any b-reps model indeed exists,, enabling future 
conversion to the 3D GIS format. 
Figure 6 is an obvious example for producing 3D City Models, which is one of the tasks 
required from the “Intermediate 3d Cadastral System”. 
Using the AutoCAD for building Figures 5 and 6 proves its easy implementation. This 
importance characteristic comes from the fact that every surveyor has CAD software. 
In addition, today an AutoCAD 2002 macro is being developed by using Visual Basic for 
Application (VBA), to imitate the way the “Intermediate 3D Cadastral System” works.
