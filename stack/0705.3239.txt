The magnetic field-dependent longitudinal and Hall components of the resistivity ρxx(H) 
and ρxy(H) are measured in graphene on silicon dioxide substrates at temperatures from 
1.6 K to room temperature.  At charge densities near the charge-neutrality point ρxx(H) is 
strongly enhanced and ρxy(H) is suppressed, indicating nearly equal electron and hole 
contributions to the transport current.  The data are inconsistent with uniformly 
distributed electron and hole concentrations (two-fluid model) but in excellent agreement 
with the recent theoretical prediction for inhomogeneously distributed electron and hole 
regions of equal mobility.  At low temperatures and high magnetic fields ρxx(H) saturates 
to a value ~h/e2, with Hall conductivity << e2/h, which may indicate a regime of localized 
v = 2 and v = -2 quantum Hall puddles.

One of the most fascinating aspects of graphene is that the quasiparticle 
Hamiltonian is identical to that of massless Dirac fermions.  This results in a number of 
interesting properties: a linear dispersion relation with a electron-hole symmetry, Fermi 
velocity independent of energy, absence of charge carrier mass, chirality of the electronic 
wavefunction (pseudospin degree of freedom), and the “Dirac point” at which the density 
of states vanishes linearly without the presence of an energy gap.  A striking aspect of 
experiments is that a finite conductivity is observed in graphene for all charge 
densities[1], with a minimum conductivity σxx,min on order 4e2/h (but sometimes 
significantly smaller[2] or larger[3]) occurring near the charge-neutrality point (CNP; in 
the absence of disorder, the CNP and Dirac point are identical).  The observation of a 
finite minimum conductivity has sparked significant theoretical interest.  Models 
invoking only short-range scattering[4] give σxx,min = 4e2/πh only exactly at the CNP, and 
fail to reproduce the linear gate-voltage dependence of the conductivity σxx(Vg).  Other 
attempts[5] using the Landauer formalism also obtain σxx ~ 4 e2/πh which depends 
weakly on aspect ratio, but such models are only expected to be valid in the ballistic limit 
for wide samples, l < L < W, where l is the mean free path, L the sample length, W the 
sample width.  Some experiments have probed this limit[2], but many do not. 
In this Letter we show that the conductivity near the CNP is dominated by 
disorder.  Distinct electron and hole puddles[6] give rise to a large magnetoresistivity 
with functional form consistent with theoretical work on effective media[7] and with a 
charge density in agreement with a self-consistent theory for Coulomb scattering in 
graphene[8].  At low temperatures and high magnetic fields the longitudinal resistivity 
ρxx(H) saturates to a value ~h/e2, with Hall conductivity σxy(H)  << e2/h.  The spatially 

inhomogeneous nature of the CNP[6] indicates that this “plateau”[9, 10] may in fact be 
due to localized v = 2 and v = -2 quantum Hall (QHE) puddles; the width in gate voltage, 
and temperature and field dependence of this feature are consistent with this model. 
Our graphene devices are obtained by mechanical exfoliation of Kish graphite on 
300 nm SiO2 on silicon substrates.  Graphene flakes are located using an optical 
microscope, and contacted with Cr/Au electrodes using electron beam lithography.  
Figure 1a shows an optical micrograph of a completed device; all the data in this paper 
are from this device.   
We first characterize the density dependence of the conductivity of this device at 
zero and high magnetic field.  Figure 1b shows the longitudinal conductivity σxx as a 
function of gate voltage Vg.  We identify the conductivity minimum at Vg = 1.7 V as the 
CNP.  Away from the CNP, the conductivity increases linearly.  We estimate the mobility 
µ = (1/cg)dσxx/dVg is 1.6 T-1 and 2.0 T-1 for electrons and holes respectively, where cg = 
1.15 x 10-4 F/m2.   
Figure 1c shows σxx and the Hall conductivity σxy as a function of gate voltage at a 
magnetic field of 8 T.  The Hall conductivity shows the half-integer quantized plateaux 
that are a signature of graphene[1, 11]: σxy = νe2/h, with ν = 4(n + 1/2) and n an integer, e 
the electronic charge, and h Planck’s constant.  The plateau-like region σxy ≈ 0 is also 
evident[9, 10].   
We now discuss the magnetoresistivity ρxx(H) near the CNP.  Figure 2 shows 
ρxx(H) at Vg = 1.7V and temperatures from 1.6 K to room temperature.  At low fields the 
magnetoresistivity is roughly temperature independent.  At higher fields the resistivity 
tends to saturate at a value ~0.4h/e2 at low temperatures, and increases with no saturation 

for H < 8 T at room temperature.  Figure 3 shows the gate voltage dependence of the low-
field magnetoresistivity, characterized by the curvature d2ρxx(H)/dH2.  The 
magnetoresistivity has a sharp peak at the CNP, and falls to near zero at gate voltages 
more than a few volts from the CNP (at Vg = 10V, the curvature is already three orders of 
magnitude lower than at the CNP).   
We discuss the possible origins of the magnetoresistivity.  Weak antilocalization 
is possible in graphene[12], and results in a positive magnetoresistivity.  However, this 
effect should saturate at a small magnetic field scale roughly set by the coherence length 
squared, and should be strongly temperature dependent.   
Within the Drude model, a two-dimensional conductor with a single carrier type 
exhibits no transverse magnetoresistivity, because the force exerted by the Hall field 
cancels the Lorentz force, and the drift current and resistive voltage are in the same 
direction.  However, a conductor with electrons and holes may exhibit large transverse 
magnetoresistivity, because the electrons and holes may develop components of drift 
velocity perpendicular to the current which cancel to give zero net transverse current.  It 
is reasonable to expect both holes and electrons to be present at zero temperature in 
semimetallic graphite, and at finite temperature in graphene.  Such a two-fluid model has 
indeed been proposed to explain the gate voltage dependence of the Hall conductivity in 
few-layer[13] and single-layer[14] graphene. For a conductor with electrons and holes of

where α = (p-n)/(p+n).  At the CNP, α = 0, and ρxx(H) ∝ 1 + (µH)2 and ρxy = 0.  Far from 
the CNP, we expect that |α| → 1, and ρxx(H) ≈ ρxx(0).  This model thus explains 
qualitatively the sharp peak in ρxx(H) at the CNP (see Figure 3).  However, it does not 
explain the functional form of ρxx(H); Figure 4 shows ρxx(H) at T = 300 K, open circles 
are the experimental data, while the dashed line is a fit to Eqn. 1 with μ = 1.3 T-1 and α = 
0.38.  The fit is poor; adjusting the mobility higher to fit the low-field data results in a 
much worse fit.  Additionally, the near-absence of temperature dependence of ρxx(H) is 
not explained by the two-fluid model; at the CNP, n = p ≈ 2.1(kT/ħvF)2, so we expect 
ρxx(0) and hence ρxx(H) to depend quadratically on temperature.  As discussed previously, 
another mechanism is already needed to explain the finite conductivity on order e2/h at 
the CNP. We put a further constraint on this mechanism: it must also explain the 
magnetoresistivity at the CNP. 
 
The finite conductivity and the large magnetoresistivity at the CNP together do 
suggest p+n remains finite while p-n → 0.  There is another scenario in which this is 
possible: Adam et al.[8] propose that local potential fluctuations may induce electron and 
hole doped regions in a nominally neutral graphene sheet.  Graphene samples are 
characterized in terms of a single parameter, the density of Coulomb impurities nimp, 
which accurately predicts the minimum conductivity, the charge density at which the 
CNP appears, and the field effect mobility.   Within this model, the impurity density is 
given by nimp = (5 x 1015 V-1s-1)μ -1 ≈ 2.77 x 1015 m-2 for our sample (using μ = 1.8 T-1, 
the average for electrons and holes).  At the CNP, the current is carried by an effective 

carrier density n* ≈ 1.08 x 1015 m-2, the minimum conductivity is given by σxx,min = 
(20e2/h)(n*/nimp) ≈ 7.8e2/h, the CNP occurs at a gate voltage Vg,CNP ≈  
gc

n /

(nimp
2/4n*)e/cg = 2.5 V, while the spatial charge inhomogeneity is expected to be 
important in a region of width ΔVg =  2n*e/cg = 3.0 V around the CNP.  These values are 
in good agreement with the experimental values σxx,min = 5.9e2/h, and Vg,CNP =  1.7 V.  
ΔVg agrees well with both the width of the peak in magnetoresistivity vs. Vg in Figure 3, 
and the width of the plateau where σxy ≈ 0 in Figure 1b (~2.1 V).   
 
We now discuss the expected magnetoresistivity for the model of Adam, et al.[8]  
While the general problem of magnetoresistivity in a spatially inhomogeneous conductor 
is complex[15], the magnetoresistivity of an inhomogeneous distribution of electrons and 
holes with equal mobility and equal concentrations has been solved exactly[7], and has a 
simple analytical form:

Equation 2 predicts a magnetoresistivity which is linear in H at high fields.  
Experimentally we observe a sub-linear dependence on H.  We find however, that the

In Figure 4, we plot the experimental data (open circles) and a fit to Eqn. 3 (solid line) 
with σxx,0 = 7.1 e2/h, σxx,1 = 0.81 e2/h, and μ = 3.1 T-1.  The fit is excellent.  We do not yet 
understand the origin of the extra conductivity term in Eqn. 3, however, it is reasonable to 
expect deviation from Eqn. 2 for several reasons: the electron and hole concentration are 
not perfectly balanced, the electron and hole mobilities are not equal, and the sample 

geometry is far from the ideal Hall bar (some current must flow through the electrodes).  
However, σxx,0 is an order of magnitude larger than σxx,1, indicating that the bulk of the 
magnetoresistivity is described by the unusual (1+(μH)2)1/2 dependence.  From the 
conductivity and mobility obtained from the fit to Eqn. 3 we can obtain a carrier density 
n*exp = σxx,0/μe = 0.55 x 1014 m-2.  This density is about half the predicted n* ≈ 1.08 x 
1015 m-2.  If we use μ = 3.1 T-1 in the theory of Ref. [8] we obtain n* ≈ 0.70 x 1014 m-2, in 
better agreement.  Overall the data suggest that there is a modest enhancement of the 
mobility near the charge neutrality point.  We also note that the calculated low-field ρxy 
for n = 5.5 x 1014 m-2 and μ = 3.1 T-1 is about ten times larger than the observed ρxy, in 
agreement with near-cancellation of electron and hole contributions to the Hall field. 
 
At low temperatures and high magnetic fields, ρxx(H) saturates to a constant value 
~0.4h/e2.  Additionally, a plateau-like region of σxy ≈ 0 is evident in σxy(Vg).  This latter 
feature has been interpreted as an integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) state arising either 
from the splitting of the valley degeneracy in the n = 0 Landau level (LL)[9], or due to 
spin splitting of the 0th LL resulting in counter-propagating spin polarized edge 
states[10].   The latter model gives rise to a dissipative QHE state, in which σxy is only 
approximately quantized, and ρxx is finite.  Such a dissipative QHE state would also be 
expected in spatially inhomogeneous graphene, in which the 0th LL lies below or above 
the Fermi level in electron or hole regions respectively.  The bulk then would consist of 
incompressible electron and hole QHE liquids, separated by regions in which the n = 0 
LL crosses the Fermi level, i.e. fourfold degenerate edge states with counter-propagating 
modes.  From μ = 3.1 T-1 and n*exp = 5.5 x 1014, we estimate the scattering time τ = 340 
fs, and the LL broadening Γ ≈ ħ/τ = 1.9 meV.  For H = 8 T the spacing between the 0th 

and 1st LL is ~100 meV, the Zeeman energy is gμBH = 0.9 meV assuming g = 2.  The 
average density n*exp gives a LL filling factor v = 2 at H = 1.1 T, and 0.3 at H = 8 T.  Of 
course, the maximum density within the puddle must be greater than the average density 
n*, and the QHE occurs over a broad range around the quantized filling factor (for 
example, the v = +2 plateau occurs from v = 1.1 - 3.3), so it is reasonable that the puddles 
could be in the v = ±2 QHE states. Recently the imaging of electron and hole puddles in 
graphene was reported[16], and the puddle diameter estimated to be ~30 nm.  We then 
expect that quantum effects should be important when the magnetic length is less than the 
puddle diameter, i.e. H > 0.8 T, and the temperature is less than EF(n*), i.e. T < 160 K.  
This is in excellent agreement with Figure 2 where significant deviation of ρxx(H) from 
Eqn. 3 occurs at temperatures T ≤ 100K and H ≥ 0.8 T.   
In conclusion, graphene exhibits pronounced magnetoresistivity very near the 
charge neutrality point (CNP).  The magnetoresistivity is consistent with coexistence of 
electrons and holes near the CNP, and fits well the theoretical result[7] for spatially 
distinct electron and hole regions of equal mobility.  At low temperatures and high 
magnetic fields the resistivity saturates to a value ~e2/h, and the Hall conductivity is near 
zero on the scale of e2/h.  This “v = 0” Hall plateau may be the signature of local v = 2 
and v = -2 quantum Hall regions in the sample at the CNP.
