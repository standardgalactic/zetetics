Abstract
The most elusive experience of the human being in this huge endless universe is related to “the human consciousness”, human awareness 
of what is surrounding him, perceiving surroundings nature with deep interceptions and incorporating all of this in the context of emotional 
experience based on memory and self-identity. The author defines consciousness as” state of alertness and being aware, active and vigilant of the 
self and surroundings with volition, based in memory and personal identity. This state is ineffable and intrinsic and express itself in presence of 
soul through activation of different sensing and perceptive body organs but may pass through lighter densities and variable dimensions in quantum 
nature, if soul leaves the body” [1]. The following discussions in this chapter will expand the understanding in those directions. The sophisticated 
neurobiological dynamics within the cerebral cortex dominated the scientific views on consciousness science in the current era. However, there 
is compelling scientific and rational evidence to convince scientific communities that the nature of consciousness involves dynamics inside the 
skull but essentially much beyond it in extreme dimensions between the skull and the sky [1]. Holistic perception and understanding of human 
consciousness incorporating other scientific disciplines like the central role of human heart contribution to consciousness, quantum physics, as 
well as astrobiologigcal aspects of consciousness are critically needed for creation of proper perspective of the nature of human consciousness. 
Groundbreaking developments in the field with new era of scientific evidence of consciousness beyond the skull, started with shaking the believe 
and refuting that neuronal firing of brain structures is the sole source of subjective consciousness experience. In addition, the principles of classical 
mechanics stand handicapped in front of the challenges to explain the true mechanisms operating the secrets of consciousness. We introduce a new 
integral understanding of human consciousness called the Heart Based Resonant Frequencies [HBRF] Theory of consciousness based on biological 
and astrophysical experimental records integrating the up to date achieved knowledge in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and its universal correlates in 
integration with the current quantum consciousness theories.
Resonance in Biology and Astrophysics
Resonance refers to vibration of large amplitude in electrical or 
mechanical system caused by a relatively small periodic stimulus of 
the same or nearly the same period as the natural vibration period 
of the system. The concept of resonance and its implementations 
in physiological as well as astrophysical rhythms is of critical 
significance for life on earth and to human consciousness experience. 
Common resonant frequencies are what allows different parts of 
the brain to achieve a phase transition in the speed and bandwidth 
of information flows between the constituent parts. This phase 

transition allows for richer varieties of consciousness to arise, with 
the character and content of that consciousness in each moment 
determined by the particular set of constituent neurons [2]. The 
coherence and the delicate organization of the universe is long 
lasting conceptual direction that affects the applied sciences and 
points to gigantic governor who master all things at all times. Nikola 
Tesla is one of the great thinkers in human history. We consider him 
as our father in the field who inherited to us important heritage 
of wisdom. An example of this wisdom is his statement “ If you

want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, 
frequency and vibration”. Resonance is perceived by us and others 
as a universal phenomenon that can be shared between all living 
systems including biological systems and astrophysical ecosystems 
in away where different systems may resonate in proximity ending 
up with resonating together at the same frequency, to achieve a 
shared resonance. Reviewing todays literature demonstrate that 
resonance as a phenomenon was attractive conceptual part of 
theories on brain dynamics and consciousness. Compelling concept 
which deserve full contemplation essential to preserve intellectual 
alignment between ecosystems is the idea that matter owns mind 
and certain degree of consciousness is conceivably a feature of all 
micro and marco creatures. At astrophysical level, the miraculous 
accuracy of orbiting journeys of the 125 billions galaxies and its 
stars and plants must have superb intelligent conscious system 
guiding it over the timeline of life history. At biological level the 
synchrony and marvelous accuracy of dynamics between human 
body systems in specific and the diversity of biology cannot be 
believed to happen without higher intelligent consciousness. What 
is astonishing and diving us deep in the extreme believe of the 
gigantic power controlling all life and universe is what we document 
of the delicate resonance between human heart interbeat intervals 
referred to as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the cosmos as we 
will discuss later in the next sections.
Human Heart: The King of Organs and its Dominance 
over the brain 
Revolutionary paradigm has evolved in the last 30 years 
which has its significant impact on consciousness scientific arena 
.The inability to explain and match consciousness observations 
and the failure to reproduce the exact consciousness experience 
incorporating current knowledge in the field implies presence of 
deficient rings in the long chain that demand more comprehensive 
perspective. In this regard we established the King of Organs 
International Congress for Advanced Cardiac Sciences and held five 
international congresses (2006,2008,20101,2012 and 2019). The 
King of Organs congresses are an international collaborative efforts 
between international renewed scientists in cardiac sciences, 
psychologists, astrophysicist, mathematicians, geologists, space 
engineers, signal analysis specialists and other related disciplines. 
It is chaired by us in Prince Sultan Cardiac Center (Alhasa, Saudi 
Arabia). Our academic partners are the HeartMath Institute 
and the Global Coherence Initiative (Boulder Creek, CA, USA), 
American Institute of Stress (NY, USA), the Global Consciousness 
Project (Institute of Noetic Sciences, USA), and other western 
and eastern reputable universities and collaborators. Our mission 
is to decode the great mystery of consciousness away from the 
traditional neurobiological approach. Our research areas were 
neuroradiology, solar and geomagnetic fluctuations and how it 
affects human autonomic nervous system, quantum physics of the 
human heart and brain and other related subjects. The heart as the 
dominant energetic organ of the human body and the role of heart 
rate variability (HRV) and its orchestrating symphony in the human 
body and the universe were the illuminators and the distinguished 
new scientific arena of the King of Organs Congresses. Revolutionary 
paradigm of the human heart has evolved which awaken ancient 
wisdom believes and perspective of the human heart as king 
of organs and master of the human consciousness experience. 
Scientific discussions that has been the main theme of King of 
Organs International Conferences was the establishment of the 
magnificent non pumping functions of human heart, neurologically, 
biochemically, biophysically and most importantly energetically as 
the dominant magnetic field generator in human body. In specific, 
major investigative efforts has been devoted to the discovery that 
the heart detect stimulus before the brain, brain neural events are 
locked to heartbeats, Heart Beat Evoked Potentials (HBEPs) and 
its role in interoception and the human heart connections to the 
cosmic environments and the far galaxies. The amplitude of the 
cardiac electrical signal is about 60 times greater compared to the 
brain while the electromagnetic field of the heart is approximately 
5000 times stronger than the brain and can be detected six feet 
away from the body with sensitive magnetometers [1]. There is a 
direct mathematical relationship between the HRV patterns, and 
the spectral information encoded in the magnetic field [3]. 
The vagal nerve is never vagal: The Afferent Cardiac 
Neuronal Traffic and Consciousness
The field of neuroradiology is relatively new discipline which 
was discussed first time in a scientific conference in King of Organs 
2008, Saudi Arabia. The meticulous and sophisticated neurological 
afferent pathways (Figure 1) as well as energetic dominance of 
the heart over the brain was astonishing for the modern scientific 
communities. 
Karl Pribram’s proposed that low frequency oscillations gener­
ated by the heart and body in the form of afferent neural hormonal 
and electrical patterns are the carriers of emotional information 
and the higher frequency oscillations found in the EEG reflect the 
consciousness. John and Beatrice Lacey during 1960s and 1970s 
created a massive drift in the modern psychophysiological arena. 
Heart- Brain communication science was revolutionized with their 
publication declaring that afferent input from the heart and car­
diovascular system could significantly affect perception, cognitive 
functions and behavior which all reflect in conscious experience. 
The heart behaves as if it had a mind of its own. Laceys showed 
that patterns of physiological responses were affected as much by 
the context of a specific task and its requirements as by emotion­
al stimuli, in clear contradiction to Cannon theory of homeostasis 
which claim constant internal environment, he called the milieu 
intérieur. Directional fractionation is a phenomenon described by

Laceys which denotes paradoxical heart rate response as it de­
celerated and blood pressure decreased, while simultaneously 
recorded parameters such as, respiratory rate, pupillary dilation 
and skin conductance all increased as expected. Later, Velden and 
Wolk demonstrated cognitive performance fluctuated at a rhythm 
around 0.1 Hz and showed that the modulation of cortical function 
was via the heart’s influence due to afferent inputs on the neurons 
in the thalamus, which globally synchronizes cortical activity and 
the consciousness phenomena [1,4,5]. A critical observation here is 
the finding that “pattern and stability” (of the rhythm) of the heart’s 
afferent inputs, rather than the number of neural bursts within the 
cardiac cycle that will modulate thalamic activity, which in turn has 
global effects on brain function and ultimately the consciousness 
experience [1,6]. Growing body of respectful research has since 
been accumulating indicating that afferent information processed 
by the intrinsic cardiac nervous system can influence activity in the 
frontocortical areas and motor cortex, affecting psychological fac­
tors and the consciousness experience elements such as attention 
level, motivation, perceptual sensitivity, and emotional processing 
[1,6-8]. Astonishing fact of the vagus nerve (means the nerve with 
unknown role) called sometimes, the tenth cranial nerve is the fact 
that it has very significant afferent neurons beside its efferent neu­
rons [1]. Around 85–90% of the fibers in the vagus nerve are affer­
ent [9]. The majority of higher brain centers, as well as emotional 
experience and cognitive processes are operated by Cardiovascular 
related afferent neural traffic [10]. The vagus nerve carries afferent 
connections to the deep nuclei of the brain via the nucleus solitaries 
(Figure 1). Numerous brain centers including the thalamus, hypo­
thalamus, and amygdala are connected to cardiovascular afferents. 
Range of frequencies of complex afferent information related to me­
chanical and chemical factors is continuously sent to the brain and 
is over time scales ranging from milliseconds to minutes [11]. Va­
gal afferent nerve stimulation was shown to reduces migraine and 
cluster headaches and to improve cognitive processing and mem­
ory [12]. These afferent connections have multiple consciousness 
related targets, which include the thalamus, amygdala, reticular 
formation, hippocampus, raphe nucleus, and the locus coeruleus. 
Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) will create improved global neu­
rostimulation state leading to promoted spread of cortical signals 
and caused an increase of metabolic activity leading to behavioral 
improvement as measured with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised 
(CRS-R) scale [1,13].
The Delicate Orchestration of Cardiovascular 
System with the Universal Resonances; the Solar 
and Planetary Geomagnetic Activity
All biological systems on the planet are exposed to an external 
and internal environment of fluctuating invisible wide range 
of magnetic fields frequencies. These fields can affect virtually 
every cell and circuit to a greater or lesser degree. Numerous 
physiological rhythms have been shown to be synchronized with 
solar and geomagnetic activity. Geomagnetic and solar influences 
affect a wide range of human rhythmic systems with the nervous 
and cardiovascular systems, with their significant contribution 
to consciousness, being the most clearly impacted [14]. Sharp 
variations of sudden and sharp nature of geomagnetic , solar 
activity and its resultant geomagnetic storms can act as stressors, 
which has the capacity to alter body regulatory processes and 
rhythmic systems such as melatonin/serotonin balance, blood 
pressure, breathing, reproductive, immune, neurological, and 
cardiac system processes [15-18]. In the clinical arena significant 
increases in hospital admissions for depression, mental disorders 
psychiatric admission, homicides, suicide attempts, and traffic 
accidents are associated with planetary geomagnetic disturbances 
[19-25]. Increase incidence of myocardial infarctions, vascular 
variability disorders, local and global communication between 
humans during geomagnetic disturbances are all denotes that 
brain and cardiovascular systems are clear targets for the planetary 
geomagnetic disturbances [26-31]. Exacerbation of present disease 
like development of cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy is well known 
during disturbed geomagnetic activity. Clinical evaluation of humans 
in this prosperous era of geomagnetic knowledge should be done 
counting at all times the fact that every cell in our body is bathed in an 
external and internal environment of fluctuating invisible magnetic 
forces that can affect virtually every cell and circuit in biological 
systems. Therefore, it should not be surprising that numerous 
physiological rhythms in humans and global collective behaviors 
are not only synchronized with solar and geomagnetic activity, but 
disruptions in these fields can create adverse effects on human 
health and behavior. The most likely mechanism for explaining 
how solar and geomagnetic influences affect human health and 
behavior are a coupling between the human nervous system and 
resonating geomagnetic frequencies called Schumann resonances, 
Alfven waves, and other very low frequency resonances that occur 
in the earth-ionosphere resonant cavity. It is well established that 
Shumann Resonant frequencies directly overlap with those of 
the human brain, and the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous 
systems. Low frequency magnetic oscillations, around 3 Hz, was 
observed to cause altered EEG rhythms with sedative effect [32]. 
Applying the lowest Schumann Resonance(SR) frequency of 7.8 Hz 
with 90 nano Tesla for 1.5 hours was found to be cardioprotective 
from stress conditions with reduction of the amount of CK released 
to the buffer, during normal conditions, hypoxic conditions and 
oxidative stress induced by 80 μM H2O2 [33]. Schumann resonance 
frequency is 7.83 hertz (Hz), with a (day/night) variation of around 
±0.5 Hz. The higher frequencies are ~14, 20, 26, 33, 39 and 45 Hz, 
all of which closely overlay with alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz) 
and gamma (30–100 Hz) brain waves. The delicate orchestration of 
this universal symphony and vibrations with the human autonomic 
nervous system (ANS) that interacts with cerebral cortex and

control heart rhythm, respiration, digestive functions and other 
involuntary activities was investigated. The longest record in 
human history of human heart rate variability (HRV) synchronized 
with Solar Wind Indices, Shumann Resonances(SR) and Galactic 
Cosmic Rays(GCR) monitoring was achieved by our group [34]. 
We completed long-term study where we examined relationships 
between solar and magnetic factors and the time course and lags 
of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to changes in solar 
and geomagnetic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded 
for 72 consecutive hours each week over a five-month period in 16 
participants in order to examine ANS responses during normal 
background environmental periods. Environmental data activity 
across the study period are seen in Figure 2. 
We were able to confirm that changes in solar and geomagnetic 
activity during periods of normal undisturbed activity affect daily 
ANS activity. ANS dynamics is known to be critical for human’s 
psychophysiological wellbeing [6]. In another publication, we were 
able to document significant correlations between the group’s HRV 
and solar wind speed, Kp, Ap, solar radio flux, cosmic ray counts, 
Schumann resonance power, and the total variations in the magnetic 
field [27]. This affect is initiated at different times after the changes 
in the various environmental factors and persist over varying time 
periods. Peaks of increased solar activity occurs every 10.5 to 11 
years. During those peaks, the sun emits increased ultraviolet (UV) 
energy and solar radio flux, which is measured by the 2.8 GHz signal 
(F10.7) [27].
We considered Solar wind intensity as biological stressor as 
increase in its intensity is well correlated to increase heart rate. 
Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) are highly energetic particles that 
originate outside the solar system and are likely formed by nuclear 
explosive events in supernova and other mega giant galaxies. These 
highly energetic particles consist of fully ionized nuclei ranging from 
hydrogen, accounting for approximately 89% of the GCR spectrum, 
to trace amounts of uranium. The planetary magnetic field and 
the solar winds are protective for life on earth from this extremely 
ionized ray. The synchrony of those three critical environmental 
factors to the human information carrier represented by HRV is 
shown in Figure 3.
We documented that human HRV with its modulatory effect 
on the consciousness pillars through ascending neuronal input 
to cortical and sub cortical structures increases with rise of the 
three major universal vibrations that we examined: Solar Winds, 
Shumann Resonances(SR), and the Galactic Cosmic Rays(GCR).
This complex interaction between HRV and those environmental 
energetic fields may contribute to the human knowdelege about 
the pathomechanistic effects on human psychphysiological 
homeostasis and the consciousness experience (Figure 3).

The Quantum Consciousness
The idea that quantum mechanics has something to do with the 
workings of the mind was developed by Eugene Wigner, Hungarian-
American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize Laurete in Physics 
in 1963, who proposed that the wave function collapses due to its 
interaction with consciousness. Freeman Dyson argued that “mind, 
as manifested by the capacity to make choices, is to some extent 
inherent in every electron. David Bohm is theoretical physicists 
who contributed significantly to quantum theory, neuropsychology 
and the philosophy of mind. He stimulated new era of conceptual 
approach to consciousness with more fundamental level in the 
universe. He claimed both quantum theory and relativity pointed 
to this deeper theory, which he formulated as a quantum field 
theory. Bohm’s proposed implicate order which applies both to 
matter and consciousness. He suggested that it could explain the 
relationship between them. Bohm’s views mind and matter as 
projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate 
order This more fundamental level was proposed to represent an 
undivided wholeness and an implicate order, from which arises 
the explicate order of the universe as we experience it. Holonomic 
brain theory is a branch of neuroscience investigating the idea that 
human consciousness is formed by quantum effects in or between 
brain cells. This specific theory of quantum consciousness was 
developed by neuroscientist Karl Pribram initially in collaboration

with David Bohm. In addition to the neuroanatomical components 
of the human brain including the large fiber tracts in the brain, 
neurotransmissions also occurs in dendrites and other webs of 
fine fiber branche, that form webs. Due to the billions of action 
potentials and neural impulse formations, dynamic electrical fields 
will result around these dendritic trees. Those dendritic trees can 
affect other surrounding neurons without physical contact between 
them by entanglement. In this way, processing in the brain can occur 
in a non-localized manner. An energy-based concept of information 
was described by Dennis Gabor, who invented the hologram in 
1947, which he described as quanta of information. Later on, 
he won Nobel prize in physics for this invention in 1971.Karl H. 
Pribram’s holonomic model of brain processing was described in 
his 1991 Brain and Perception book which include his perspectives 
on human consciousness with David Bohm. It describes human 
cognition by modeling the brain as a holographic storage network. 
Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in 
the brain’s dendritic networks, which are different from the more 
commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses. 
These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns 
in which memory is encoded naturally. The waves are found to be 
analyzable by Fourier transform. Gabor, Pribram and others noted 
the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of 
information in a hologram. Pribram’s holonomic model contributes 
significantly to human consciousness understanding, specially 
to the fast-associative memory and the non-locality of memory. 
In 1991 Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) theory was 
introduced by physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologists Stuart 
Hameroff. It is a biological philosophy of mind that postulates that at 
the quantum level consciousness originates inside neurons, rather 
than the traditional perspective that it is a product of connections 
between neurons. The interpreting mechanism is contributed 
to non-computational quantum process performed by quantum 
bits (qubits) formed collectively on cellular microtubules- called 
objective reduction. The qubits are based on oscillating dipoles 
(either electric or magnetic) forming superposed resonance rings in 
helical pathways throughout lattices of microtubules. Orchestration 
refers to the hypothetical process by which microtubule-associated 
proteins (MAPs) and other connective proteins, orchestrate qubit 
state reduction through modification of space time-separation 
of their superimposed states. Penrose was faced with a wave 
of criticism which is in our view not justified as his opponents 
were too limited with their perspective for human consciousness 
within the today computational intelligence language. In addition, 
postulating intuitive thoughts in the context of acceptable scientific 
language is well known and accepted approach in the philosophy 
of science. Other important contributors in the field are Hiroomi 
Umezawa and collaborators who proposed a quantum field theory 
of memory storage which is fundamentally different from the 
Penrose-Hameroff theory. In 1967, Hiroomi Umezawa together 
with L.M. Ricciardi, proposed a quantum theory of the brain 
which posits a spatially distributed charge formation exhibiting 
spontaneous breakdowns at micro levels as the basis for processing 
at macro levels. According to this model, the information resides 
in the virtual field associated with the dynamics of the cellular 
matter. Hiroomi Umezawa was known by his extreme originality. 
His approach was built upon by Karl Pribram and many others 
and expanded by Giuseppe Vitiello to a dissipative quantum model 
of brain. Another pioneer in the field is Henry Pierce Stapp. He is 
American mathematical physicist, known for his work in quantum 
mechanics who favors the idea that quantum wave functions 
collapse only when they interact with consciousness. According to 
Stapp hypothesis alternative quantum possibilities when exposed 
to conscious mind will select one. His explanation hypothesis differs 
from that of Penrose and Hameroff. Stapp postulates a process of 
global collapse through an effect on the synapses by exploitation 
certain aspects of quantum Zeno effect. David Pearce, British 
philosopher has conjectured that unitary conscious minds are 
physical states of quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions). 
It is clear at this point that scientist from different disciplines 
over the last 8 decades were trying to come closer to the absolute 
fact of consciousness. Each theory discussed has its strength and 
weaknesses, but all lack the comprehensive universal perspective 
incorporating the origin of consciousness with more homogenous 
incorporation of current theories in a stronger model capable of 
bringing us closer to consciousness realm closer than any time ever.

Why Heart Based Resonant Frequencies [HBRF] theory 
The Heart Based Resonant Fields [HBRF]theory of Consciousness 
is based on human heart as the center of human consciousness 
experience that orchestrate with the planetary and cosmic energetic 
fields. Comprehensive review of the consciousness science timeline 
revealed sincere efforts has been spent since early in the twentieth 
century as witnessed by the elite names in their fields. The 
twentieth century consciousness theories are distinguished from 
the old perspective on consciousness nature by the ting and flavor 
of quantum physics as shown in the previous section. Quantum 
physics became a true nucleus for other scientific disciplines like 
neuroscience, psychology, behavioral medicine and others. In spite 
of all reviewed theories, we believe that scientific communities in

areas produce experiential phenomena is one of the major reasons 
behind our exploration for convincing theory of consciousness 
[35]. Holistic perspective with spectrum of hierarchical descendant 
behavior comprising galaxies to genes is immediately needed. This 
type of perspective demands massive universal indicator capable 
of encompassing universal frequencies which must be truly 
representing the universe as astrobiology in one end and humans 
as biology in the other end. The miraculous choice in this direction 
is the information and frequencies embedded between human 
heart beats, known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV science 
represent the neurobiology of psychophysiological wellbeing and 
in the same time the only well documented biological window to 
the planetary resonance [6]. It is rapidly maturing paradigm that 
integrates health and wellness observations across a wide variety 
of biomedical and psychosocial phenomena and illustrates this 
nonlinear path of development [36]. The transformation of the 
mathematical calculations of HRV frequencies and its modulation 
to treat human disease non pharmaceutically, is an emerging and 
highly promising success [37]. This type of innovative therapeutic 
models raise our confidence of the inherent capability of the 
universally correlated frequencies emanating from our bodies to 
treat human diseases. On the other hand, the delicate orchestration 
of the human consciousness from beyond the brain became 
increasingly accepted scientific discussion. Resonances of HRV 
frequencies with cosmic energetic fields and frequencies is a 
strategic turning point and new understanding in the history of 
science. Advances especially, our work and others, in the science 
of Heart Rate Variability[HRV] and the role of ascending neuronal 
afferents from the heart to the brain in addition to the miraculous 
universal symphony between human heart and the universe 
constitute the most important revolutions in the new understanding 
[26-34]. Adopting the quantum consciousness theories in the new 
understanding based on human heart energetic interaction with 
multiple energetic fields and frequencies constitute the bases of 
our new understanding of consciousness experience. At this level, 
it is conspicuous that an integral comprehensive biological and 
astrophysical evidence of human consciousness based on long term 
repetitive monitoring of biological indicators synchronized with 
astrophysical frequencies is highly needed.
Heart based resonant frequencies theory of human 
consciousness
Consciousness theories based in neurophilosophy and personal 
background are accepted scientific trend in the different medical 
schools including our current western era medicine. Experimental 
work in the field is astonishingly limited. The perfect direction in 
the field of consciousness science which was thought as far 
unrealistic dream is to do a universal based experiment with four 
cardinal components: First is to choose a measurable indicator of 
common biological and astrophysical sensitivity which is malleable 
for Fourier analysis. Second: this indicator must be of true universal 
expansion to perceive the true consciousness eternal nature. Third 
is the ability to record the dynamics and responses of this indicator 
and its synchronicity with ecosystem variables and indicators for as 
long time period as possible. Fourth is the ability of this indicator to 
merge easily and in complementary manner with the quantum 
physics theories if applicable. This seemingly magic indicator was 
found to be the human Heart Rate Variability(HRV) which was 
investigated by our Task force Group in the King of Organs 
conferences (2006,2008,2010,2012,2019), and found to be truly 
representing the whole mark of human being consciousness 
experience from the two ends of the massive universal spectrum 
:the neurobiology of psychophysiological wellbeing at one end and 
in the other end the planetary resonances [3-7,14]. Based on those 
solid scientific convections we were able to achieve the longest 
record of human Heart Rate Variability [HRV][96000 hours] 
synchronized with the near planetary frequencies, namely the 
Shumann resonances [SR] and the far, namely Solar Wind indices 
and the extremely far Cosmic frequencies originating from the 
endless universal nuclear explosions, namely the Galactic Cosmic 
Rays[GCR] [38]. Increase in cosmic rays, solar radio flux, and 
Schumann resonance power was all associated with increased HRV 
and parasympathetic activity. Complementary to our hypothesis is 
the heart magnetic field interactions with the brain neuronal 
electrical fields as described by Karl Pribram as well as the quantum 
bit state reduction on micro tubules proposed by Penrose and 
Hamerof and Hiroomi Umezawa and collaborators who proposed a 
quantum field theory of memory storage. Our hypothesis is based 
on postulating that there is gigantic source of information contains 
the most delicate details of the emergence and the fate of all life 
events and all galaxies and creatures within it. The information is 
documented and preserved with infinitive accuracy in the form of 
endless gigantic nuclear energetic fields that we call the Preserved 
Board[PB].The eternal and the eterral governer of the PB is the 
miraculous intelligent consciousness of the whole polyverse and all 
life and beyond. In our domain we call him ALLAH [39]. Our 
hypothesis of the global consciousness including human 
consciousness is based on three levels of energetic fields. First is 
the source of the energy, namely the PB, second is the media of 
information transmission, namely the massive electrosoliton and 
the potential magnetic patterns and fields transmitted through the 
galaxies until earth, third is the receiver, the discriminator, and the 
magnetic patterns generator namely the heart and its pulsating 
magnetic field and associates in addition to the entangled 
electromagnetic fields, neurobiological processes of the brain and 
electrodermal response. Electrosolitons, which are the charge, 
energy, and information carriers in the metabolic processes in 
biological systems, according to Davydov’s hypothesis [39], are 
formed in alpha-helical proteins, DNA, and hydrogen-bonded water 
molecule chains, present in living cells, intercellular tissues, and in

all ecological systems [40]. The electromagnetic fields of the 
universal systems and its associated potential patterns is the 
information carrier. The dynamic mass of the electrosoliton 
depends on the frequency of the magnetic field which affect charge 
transport processes. At the resonant frequency, electrosoliton wave 
will be drifted by the magnetic field and accordingly emit radiation 
and sound waves intensively then lose their energy. Electrosolitons 
emit their own electromagnetic radiation with the frequency of the 
main harmonic which is dependent on their own velocity. 
Electromagnetic potential can cause the emergence of the coherent 
structures that in view of their coherence, openness, and 
nonlinearity, are able to self-organize and form various hierarchical 
levels of ecosystems [41]. The human biological system has the 
ability to induce an electromagnetic field, either through solitons, 
or during melanin synthesis, which is able to convert a photon into 
a phonon and vice versa. This electromagnetic resource provides 
the mechanism for the non-locality, complexity, and self-consistency 
(self-maintaining) of biological organisms and ecosystems [42]. Via 
this electrosoliton emitted electromagnetic radiation, subunits of 
the complex system [cells, organs, individuals, ecosystems] 
exchange their information which leads to the appearance of the 
long-range order in a process of the massive hierarchy of ecosystems 
that is ongoing in descending manner from the galaxies to the local 
electromagnetic field [EMF] of the heart and brain with impressive 
accuracy. The HRV of human heart, which is an accurate indicator of 
the human psychophysiological and consciousness state, is in 
delicate symphony with the higher energetic fields [6,38]. There is 
a direct mathematical relationship between the HRV patterns 
which contains our magnetic potentials of our emotions and the 
spectral information encoded in the magnetic field [7]. This 
ultimately means that our emotions and consciousness, through 
our heart energies and fields are truly pulsating and resonate with 
the far universe in highly organized hierarchical manner. Our new 
perspective of human consciousness can blend easily in 
complementary manner with David Bohm’s model of the implicate 
order and its projection, or extrusion into space–time, and with 
Karl Pribram holonomic mind/brain theory. When the descendant 
information from the PB transformed by the magnetic fields- 
emitted from the interaction of magnetic fields with the massive 
electrosoliton wave- it interacts with the human heart EMF and 
brain neuronal entangled fields and neuronal synapses [39]. 
Psychokinetic process will take over where several encoded choices 
within the descendant magnetic potential patterns will interact 
with heart EMF and brain neuronal entangled fields. According to 
the wave function collapse, the descendant magnetic potential 
patterns will be reduces to a single pattern at variable time intervals. 
Von 
Neumann–Wigner 
interpretation 
mentioned 
about 
“consciousness causes collapse” in the context of quantum 
mechanics as general description of the consciousness experience. 
Psychokinetic effect of all humanity on collective global 
consciousness can be thought of with the size of energetic levels fed 
by over 7 billion beating human hearts to the space. This would be 
the source of a radiant magnetic potential’s energy feeding into an 
evolving planetary fields. Our postulated underlying mechanism for 
this conscious decision making step of the HBRF theory is a dual 
effect of an interaction of the descendant magnetic potential and 
the neuronal entanglement fields as described by Karl Pribram and 
the global process collapse through an effect on the synapses with 
means of quantum Zeno effect as described by Henry Pierce Stapp. 
Freeman Dyson argument that mind as manifested by the capacity 
to make choices, is inherent in every electron is in a strong 
concordance to the wave collapse part of our HBRF theory. We 
postulate this wave function collapse is the last step occurs between 
the cerebral neuronal entanglement fields and neuronal synapses 
interacting with the descendant magnetic potentials before final 
decision is taken. The heart afferent neuronal inputs to cortical and 
sub cortical systems and the associate neurotransmitter pathways, 
are a major player in this process of decision making of one choice 
over the other. This higher level of orchestrated consciousness from 
the PB to the neurobiology of heart and brain with the constellation 
of Information carriers, Electromagnetic force and quantum fields 
is confined exclusively to humankind for which they are committed 
to the higher power being responsible about their choices in life. 
The ancient wisdom with the rooted believe that the human heart is 
the cradle of the soul and the emanatory of human consciousness as 
well as the path to ALLAH is, for the first time, in historical 
intersection with the modern applied sciences [43].
Conclusion
Human consciousness has been considered to be one of the 
most elusive issues in life. The time is due to incorporate the huge 
scientific advances in biology, quantum physics, astrobiology, and 
philosophy to decode the mystery of consciousness, its nature, 
propagation and dynamic interactions with biology in general and 
human consciousness in specific. The concept of resonance and its 
implementations in our scientific understanding of physiological 
as well as astrophysical rhythms is of paramount role for what 
we are calling for in the direction of holistic approach for human 
consciousness. The failure to reproduce conscious experience 
with the current mainstream knowledge with neuronal firing of 
certain brain nuclei and pathways raise the flag to revolutionize 
our conceptual understanding of consciousness. Ground breaking 
developments in the direction towards coming closer to the absolute 
facts is the scientific evidence of the dominance of the human 
heart as king of organs in the energetic arena and the marvelous 
developments in the understanding of Heart Rate Variability(HRV) 
and the associated magnetic field patterns as information carriers. 
The vagal nerve is not vagal but is a true master of the afferent

cardiac input to important consciousness related regions in the 
brain. Our team achievement with the longest record in human 
history for the HRV as information carrier and its resonances with 
various cosmic frequencies including Schumann Resonances, Solar 
Winds indices and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) created massive drift 
in our basic understanding of consciousness theories. The Heart 
Based Resonant Fields [HBRF]theory of Consciousness is based 
on human heart as the center of human consciousness experience 
that orchestrate with the planetary and cosmic energetic fields. 
Important quantum consciousness theories are complementary to 
our HBRF theory. With this level of understanding we are coming 
closer to decode important aspects of the mystery of human 
consciousness towards innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic 
modalities for humanity psychophysiological wellbeing.
