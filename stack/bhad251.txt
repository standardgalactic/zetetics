It is increasingly clear that memories are distributed across multiple brain areas. Such “engram complexes” are important features
of memory formation and consolidation. Here, we test the hypothesis that engram complexes are formed in part by bioelectric fields
that sculpt and guide the neural activity and tie together the areas that participate in engram complexes. Like the conductor of an
orchestra, the fields influence each musician or neuron and orchestrate the output, the symphony. Our results use the theory of
synergetics, machine learning, and data from a spatial delayed saccade task and provide evidence for in vivo ephaptic coupling in
memory representations.
Key words: memory engrams; neural ensembles; working memory; synergetics; predictive coding; auto-encoders; effective connectivity.
Introduction
In recent decades there has been a paradigm shift in neuroscience.
In the past, we focused on properties of individual neurons (James
1890; Queenan et al. 2017). There is now a growing realization
that information storage and processing depends on spatially
distributed, dynamic groupings of neurons (Fujisawa et al. 2008;
Buschman et al. 2011; Yuste 2015), known as neural ensembles
(Buschman et al. 2012; Tayler et al. 2013; Pfau et al. 2013; Pinotsis
et al. 2017; Pinotsis and Miller 2017) or engram cells (Thompson
1976; Josselyn et al. 2015). Techniques like protein induction (Gor-
don et al. 1980), immediate early gene (IEG) expression (Guzowski
et al. 2005), and optogenetics (Fenno et al. 2011) allow for iden-
tification of ensemble neurons participating in memory storage
and recall (Ryan et al. 2015; Tonegawa et al. 2015b). Further,
recent experiments have found simultaneous neural ensembles
maintaining the same memory in many brain areas, something
known as engram complex (Poo et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2019). In
Roy et al. (2019), a total of 247 brain areas were mapped using
the protein cFos and IEG) Among them, 117 areas were found to
be significantly reactivated when a fear memory was recalled.
Thus, memory was not stored in a single brain area but was
dispersed in multiple areas and neural ensembles. Earlier theories
like memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez 1995) and multiple
traces (Nadel and Moscovitch 1997) have also found that mem-
ories are stored in multiple areas forming engram complexes.
These are connected via engram pathways formed by mono- or
poly-synaptic connections (Tonegawa et al. 2015a).
The challenge, then, is in understanding how the brain forms
engram complexes. Each brain area is connected to many oth-
ers. Anatomical connectivity alone cannot be the whole story.
Hypotheses that could explain this include that engram com-
plexes are dynamically formed by emergent properties of neu-
rons like synchronized rhythms (Harris et al. 2003; Miller et al.
2014, 2018; Lundqvist et al. 2018), possibly resulting from internal
coordination of spike timing (Singer 1999; Koch 2004), that allow
neuronal communication (Fries 2015; Lakatos et al. 2019; Reinhart
and Nguyen 2019), feature integration and perceptual segmen-
tation (Engel and Singer 2001; Moore and Obhi 2012). Here, we
report tests of the hypothesis that the electric fields generated
by neurons play a crucial role. We suggest that ephaptic coupling
(Anastassiou et al. 2011; Ruffini et al. 2020) ties together the areas
that participate in engram complexes. In other words, we test
the hypothesis that memory networks include electric fields that
carry information back to individual neurons.
Direct evidence of ephaptic coupling of spiking has been found
in brain slices (Jefferys et al. 2012; Anastassiou and Koch 2015;
Chiang et al. 2019). In vitro ephaptic coupling has been found
in LFPs. Application of external electric fields resulted in mem-
brane potentials oscillating at the same frequency as the drive
(Anastassiou et al. 2011). Support for its role in forming engram
complexes comes from studies showing that neurons participat-
ing in an engram complex showed similar functional connectivity
during optogenetic activation and memory recall (Kitamura et al.
2017; Roy et al. 2019). We found that the electric fields in the
primate prefrontal cortex carried information about the contents
of working memory (Pinotsis and Miller 2022). Using data from a
delayed saccade task (Jia et al. 2017; Pinotsis et al. 2017), we built
two models: one for neural activity (Pinotsis et al. 2017a; Pinotsis
and Miller 2017) and another for the emergent electric field.
This revealed electric field patterns that varied with contents of

working memory. Further, we found that the electric fields were
robust and stable, whereas neural activity underlying memory
showed representational drift. This latter observation suggested
the hypothesis that electric fields could act as “guard rails” that
help stabilize and funnel the high dimensional variable neural
activity along stable lower-dimensional routes.
Here we test the hypothesis that electric fields sculpt and guide
the neural activity forming engram complexes. We used a theory
of complex systems known as synergetics (Haken 1987, 2012). We
also extended the single area analysis of (Pinotsis and Miller 2022)
and focused on data from two areas known to form an engram
complex, frontal eye fields (FEF) and supplementary eye fields
(SEF). FEF and SEF areas are anatomically connected (Purcell et al.
2012) and are thought to control eye movements (Stuphorn et al.
2010). Synergetics describes how complex systems (e.g. molecules,
fluids, brain etc.) self-organize. In the case of human behavior,
synergetics describe how the collective dynamics of muscles and
body parts (e.g. fingers) give rise to behavior like rhythmic hand
movement (Haken et al. 1985). We applied synergetics to under-
stand the emergence of memory representations. We performed
mathematical, i.e. pen and paper, computations and showed that
the theory predicts that electric fields guide ensemble activity. If
ephaptic coupling occurs in a brain area and exchanges memory
information with other brain areas, then ephaptic coupling will
occur in those areas too. We then confirmed our results using
Bayesian Model Comparison (BMC; Kass and Raftery 1995; Friston
and Penny 2011), Granger Causality (GC; Barnett and Seth 2014),
and Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA; Kriegeskorte et al.
2008). This suggested that the electric field enslaves neurons,
not the other way around. Applying the slaving principle (Haken
2012), we found that the electric field controls neural activity and
oscillations through ephaptic coupling (Fröhlich and McCormick
2010; Anastassiou and Koch 2015) and that this was the case
across all recording sites that participated in the engram complex.

Task and experimental setup
We reanalyzed data from (Jia et al. 2017). The same data were
used in our earlier papers (Pinotsis et al. 2017; Pinotsis and Miller
2022b). Two adult male Macaca monkeys were trained to perform
an oculomotor spatial delayed response task. This task required
the monkeys to maintain the memory of a randomly chosen
visual target (at angles of 0◦, 60◦, 120◦, 180◦, 240◦, and 300◦, 12.5◦
eccentricity) over a brief (750 ms) delay period and then saccade
to the remembered location. If a saccade was made to the cued
angle, the target was presented with a green highlight and a
water reward was delivered. If not, the target was presented with
a red highlight and reward was withheld. Thirty-two-electrode
chronic arrays were implanted unilaterally in FEF and SEF in each
monkey. Each array consisted of a 2 × 2 mm square grid, where the
spacing between electrodes was 400 um. The implant channels
were determined prior to surgery using structural magnetic res-
onance imaging and anatomical atlases. From each electrode, we
acquired local field potentials (LFPs; extracted with a fourth-order
Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 500 Hz, and
recorded at 1 kHz) using a multichannel data acquisition system
(Cerebus, Blackrock Microsystems). We analyzed LFPs during the
delay period when monkeys held the cued angles in memory.
A neural field model of ephaptic coupling
This section summarizes a theoretical model for the description
of neural ensemble activity developed earlier (Pinotsis et al. 2017;
Pinotsis and Miller 2017, 2022). We modeled the activity of neural
ensembles. These are groups of neurons that maintain working
memory representations. Some results about their activity sum-
marized below involve lengthy derivations not repeated here. The
interested reader might consult earlier papers that are referenced
and the Supplementary Material.
In earlier work, we used the neural field theory (Jirsa and
Haken 1996; Coombes 2005; Deco et al. 2008; Robinson et al.
2016), (cf. Equation 4 in Pinotsis et al. 2017) to describe the
evolution of the transmembrane potential or depolarization, Vm,
in neural ensembles. Currents flow along the neurons’ axons
and dendrites. Chemical energy is converted to electrical. Action
and synaptic potentials are summed up to produce an emerging
“electric potential” (EP) Ve in extracellular space. The difference
of intracellular Vi and extracellular Ve potentials on either side
of the membrane, Vm = Ve
0 −Vi
0 is the transmembrane potential
(recall that the subscript “0” denotes boundary values). The time
evolution of the transmembrane potential Vm can be described by
a neural field model (Atay and Hutt 2004; Pinotsis et al. 2012; Bojak
et al. 2013). Figure 1(A) includes a schematic of a chronic array
implanted in a cortical area (for simplicity, 10 electrodes shown as
dots in the blue square). Each electrode is thought to be sampling
from a neural population in its proximity and we assumed that
the ensemble occupies a patch (cortical manifold) denoted by
. Activity is sampled at the locations of the electrodes. It is
thought to be generated by a neural population in the vicinity of
the electrode. To construct the neural field model, we numbered
the electrodes in a monotonic fashion (cf. the numbers in Fig. 1A).
For mathematical convenience, we also assumed that  can be
replaced by a line, i.e. electrodes are all next to each other (cf.
red line at the bottom of Fig. 1A). This assumption was tested in
(Pinotsis et al. 2017) and (Pinotsis and Miller 2022). There, we found
that the model explained more than 40% of the data variance.
A second test of this assumption is discussed after Equation (3)
below. The colored curves connecting electrodes (dots on the red
line at the bottom of Fig. 1A) are schematics of Gaussian functions
that describe connectivity between electrodes and populations,
see (Pinotsis et al. 2017) for details.
Our neural field model describes transient fluctuations around
baseline, similar to spontaneous activity in large scale resting
state networks (Deco et al. 2010; Pinotsis et al. 2013; Drysdale
et al. 2017). It predicts average firing rate or depolarization, similar
to activation functions in deep neural networks (LeCun et al.
2015; Pinotsis et al. 2019). Mathematically, the neural field model
suggests that the time evolution of depolarization Vm is given by
the following equation (see also Equation 4 in Pinotsis et al.(2017)):

Fig. 1. A) Neural field model and connections. Neural fields provided a quantitative way to describe each ensemble’s patterns of activity across
simultaneously recorded sites. The same model can describe different ensembles. Each electrode occupies a position on a cortical manifold (line) 
parameterized by the variable x and is connected to all other electrodes with connections whose strength follows a Gaussian profile (colored solid and
dashed lines), see (Pinotsis et al. 2017) for more details. B) Extracellular space around each neuron within the ensemble (blue cylindrical fibers). C)
Bidomain model for the electric field generated by a cylindrical fiber in a conductor. The extracellular and intracellular space are depicted by blue and
gray cylindrical fibers (see Methods for the meaning of various symbols). D) Simplified bidomain model where the measurement point is located at a
vertical distance much larger than the radius of intracellular space.
Equation (1) suggests that Vm changes as a result of three
terms: a simple decay, recurrent inputs from other parts of the
ensemble and some exogenous, stochastic input U. We called this
neural field “deep” to distinguish this model (with learned con-
nectivity parameters) from common neural field models where
connectivity weights are chosen ad hoc. The integral appearing in
Equation (1) is defined over the cortical patch, i.e. z ∈Δ and t > 0.
It describes how the diffusion of local recurrent input changes Vm.
Here, z parameterizes the location on a cortical patch occupied
by the ensemble, X is an index denoting excitatory or inhibitory
populations, K is the connectivity or weight matrix that describes
how the signal is amplified or attenuated when it propagates
between electrodes (cf. colored curves in Fig. 1A), U is endogenous
neural input and f(h) =
1
1+exp(δ(η−h)) is called transfer function.
Also, τX is the time constant of postsynaptic filtering, δ is synaptic
gain, and η is the postsynaptic potential at which the half of the
maximum firing rate is achieved, see e.g. (Pinotsis et al. 2012) for
more details.
In Pinotsis et al. (2017), we assumed that the transmembrane
potential Vm
X is sampled from a random process ˜Vm with samples

Equation (2) from Equation (1) and its relation to similar models
like Wilson and Cowan (1973), see Pinotsis and Miller (2022)
and Supplementary Material. In Equation (2), the functions w
are called the connectivity components and H are the principal
axes. The connectivity components w (second line in Equation 2)
provide the connectivity matrix K (cf. Equation 1 and Fig. 1A). They
describe how signal recorded from a certain electrode contributes
to LFP data (across all trials). They are of dimensionality number
of electrodes “by” the number of trials. The principal axes (last
line in Equation (2)) are matrices of dimensionality number of
time samples “by” the number of trials. They describe the average
instantaneous contribution to the LFP data across all electrodes.
Please see Pinotsis et al. (2017), Pinotsis and Miller (2022) as well
as the Supplementary Material for more details about and the
connectivity components and the principal axes.
To find the connectivity components w, we used a Restricted
Maximum-Likelihood (ReML) algorithm (Harville 1977). This opti-
mizes a cost function known as the Free Energy, F,

The connectivity w was obtained by training the neural
field model given by Equation (1) using the cost function given
by Equation (3) maximizes the mutual information between
the remembered cue and the ensemble activity. This can be
thought to describe synaptic efficacy in a neural ensemble
that represents a certain stimulus. In Pinotsis and Miller (2022),
we obtained the connectivity matrices and compared them to
the connectivity obtained using two independent methods: k-
means clustering (Humphries 2011) and high dimensional SVD

(Carroll and Chang 1970; Williams et al. 2018). This served as
a validation of the neural field model given by Equation (1). It
also provided a second test of the earlier assumption where we
replaced the cortical patch  by a line (red line at the bottom of
Fig. 1A). We found that the connectivity obtained after training
the neural field model with the cost function (3) is the same as
the connectivity found using pairwise correlations (Humphries
2011) and SVD (Williams et al. 2018).
To sum up, in previous work we showed that neural fields given
by Equations (1) can be rewritten like a GLM given by Equation
(2). We also showed how neural fields can be trained using the
Free Energy given by Equation (3) to obtain the connectivity K. In
Pinotsis and Miller (2022), we also showed that Wilson and Cowan
network models (Wilson and Cowan 1973) can also be written in
the form of a GLM and trained using the cost function (3). Here,
we will use neural field models given by Equation (1).
Below, we will consider an extension of the model (1) that will
include ephaptic coupling (interactions between emerging electric
fields produced by neural ensembles and the underlying neural
activity). Later, we will fit this extended as well as the original
neural field model to LFP data and assess which of the two models
fits LFPs better. This will test evidence for ephaptic coupling. We
first discuss the ephaptic extension of the neural field model
below.
Above we presented a model of neural activity (cf. Equations 1)
describing current flow within an ensemble. This current gener-
ates an electric field in extracellular space, Ee. This can directly
influence individual neurons, a phenomenon known as “ephaptic
coupling” (Fröhlich and McCormick 2010; Anastassiou et al. 2011;
Ruffini et al. 2020; Rebollo et al. 2021; Schmidt et al. 2021).
Ephaptic coupling describes interactions between the brain’s elec-
tric fields and neural activity, that is, interactions between Ee
and Vm. (Danner et al. 2011) and (Goldwyn et al. 2017) showed
that ephaptic effects result in perturbations (small increases) of
transmembrane potential by adding the value of the extracellular
potential on the membraneVe
0. They described these increases by
replacing Vm ≈Vm+Ve
0 in the term capturing local recurrent input
as a result of diffusion. In other words, they added an ephaptic
current to the diffusion current that changes the transmembrane
potential. We did the same here. We replaced Vm ≈Vm + Ve
0 in the
integral in Equation (1) that describes the diffusion of recurrent
input in the ensemble and obtained
˙Vm = −τ −1
X Vm + K∗f ◦

Vm + Ve


+ U
(4)
We called this the “ephaptic model.” Compared with Equation
(1), Equation (4) suggests that the rate of change of depolarization
comprises the same three terms as before and additionally, per-
turbations due to extracellular potential Ve
0. The ephaptic model
is used twice below: first, in “Methods,” to derive the mathematical
expression of ephaptic coupling and then, in “Results,” to find
evidence of ephaptic coupling using BMC.
A model of the ensemble electric field
We saw above that current flow within the neural ensemble
generates an electric field in extracellular space Ee = −∇Ve, where
Ve is the corresponding potential. In (Pinotsis and Miller 2022), we
introduced a model of this electric field based on the “bidomain
model” (Mc Laughlin et al. 2010; Goldwyn et al. 2017). Below, we
summarize the main points of this model. For more details, the
interested reader is invited to consult (Mc Laughlin et al. 2010;
Goldwyn et al. 2017; Pinotsis and Miller 2022).
We model the electric field in extracellular space very close
to the neural ensemble that generated it. The bidomain model
assumes that dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells comprising
neural ensembles extend parallelly. Although they have a compli-
cated geometry, this symmetry allows one to replace the branched
dendrites trees by a cylindrical fiber (Rall 1998). This is the same
symmetry as that of the current dipole approximation to cortical
sources widely used in human electrophysiology (Hämäläinen
et al. 1993; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006; Lindén et al. 2010).
In this model, pyramidal neurons are aligned to produce an
EF parallel to apical dendrites and receive synchronous input.
Current flowing in neurons gives rise to dipole sources (Buzsáki
et al. 2012; Pesaran et al. 2018). The extracellular space of each
pyramidal neuron is described by a cylindrical fiber (small blue
cylinders in Fig. 1B). Using the principle of superposition from
electromagnetism, extracellular spaces can be combined into a
unified extracellular space of the neural ensemble. Thus, the indi-
vidual cylindrical fibers of Fig. 1(B) (for each neuron) are replaced
by the larger fiber surrounding the ensemble (light blue cylinder
in Fig. 1C). The boundary between extracellular and intracellular
space has the same symmetry and is denoted by a gray cylinder
in Fig. 1(C).
The bidomain model assumes spatial homogeneity and tempo-
ral synchrony similarly to the well-known dipole approximation.
EF model estimates are a bound on realistic values of EF: actual
EFs will be smaller when these assumptions fail. Note that this
does not change qualitive results, like ephaptic coupling discussed
below as the extracellular and intracellular spaces can be split
into smaller parts (cylindrical fibers) where symmetry and syn-
chrony still apply.
This electric field Ee is the result of the discontinuity in the
electric potential Ve
0 −Vi
0 that gives rise to electric dipole sources
and transmembrane currents 1/riΔVm (Ve
0 and Vi
0 are the values
of the extracellular and intracellular EPs on the two sides of the
membrane). Intuitively, Ee is the potential difference over unit
distance. Alternatively, Ee expresses the force to which an ion is
subjected to, while in extracellular space, divided by its charge
(Jackson 1999).
Because of symmetry, the extracellular field and potential
depend on two spatial variables

x, y

, not 3. The variable x param-
eterizes the location on the axis of the cylinder in Fig. 1(C) and
(D) and y a direction orthogonal to this axis. According to the
bidomain model, the extracellular potential Ve at a point P

in the extracellular space is given in terms of the Fourier Trans-
form ˆVm of the transmembrane potential Vm by the following
expression; see Equation (17) in Pinotsis and Miller (2022b) and

potentials Ve. Thus, we can assume that the location of the LFP

Ephaptic coupling, synergetics, and the stability of the
electric field
In the next two sections of the “Methods”, we include some math-
ematical arguments that motivate hypotheses tested in “Results”.
These involve analytical, ie. pen and paper calculations. Above,
we summarized a model of the electric field generated by neural
ensembles. In Pinotsis and Miller (2022b), we used this model to
compute the EF corresponding to neural ensembles maintaining
different memory representations. We found that EFs were more
stable than neural activity and contained relatively more informa-
tion. We suggested that this stability allows the brain to control
the latent variables that give rise to the same memory. In other
words, we hypothesized that EFs can sculpt and herd neural activ-
ity and can act as “guard rails” that funnel the higher dimensional
variable neural activity along stable lower-dimensional routes.
Below we provide further mathematical arguments in support
of the above hypothesis: that bioelectric fields guide neural activ-
ity. In the “Results” section, we test this hypothesis, using data
from a spatial delayed saccade task.
We were interested in interactions between variables expressed
at different spatial and temporal scales: bioelectric fields and
neural activity. Thus, we used a theory that describes interactions
underlying spontaneous pattern formation in biological and phys-
ical systems known as “synergetics” (Haken 1987; Jirsa and Haken
1996). Synergetics studies how individual parts—in our case neu-
rons—produce structures, here, memory representations. It sug-
gests that a biological system, like a neural ensemble, is con-
strained by so-called “control parameters” that impose limita-
tions. When control parameters change, the structures change.
A simple example of a control parameter is temperature. When it
changes, the state of water molecules can change from solid, to
fluid, to air. In the synergetics language, the individual elements
of the system, e.g. molecules, are called enslaved parts. This
is because they are controlled by temperature. Besides control
parameters and enslaved parts, synergetics also considers order
parameters, that is, low-dimensional descriptions of collective
dynamics, like the average transmembrane potential Vm that we
studied here or other latent variables (Yu et al. 2008; Gallego et al.
2020) like effective connectivity components (Pinotsis et al. 2017).
A crucial distinction between control and order parameters is how
fast they evolve. When there is a perturbation, like new input
to a brain area, the order parameters and enslaved parts evolve
fast and the control parameters slowly. Control parameters are
very stable compared with order parameters. To put it differently,
synergetics suggests a temporal hierarchy comprising, slow con-
trol parameters, like temperature or energy (Ditzinger and Haken
1989), faster order parameters, and very fast enslaved parts (e.g.
oscillations/spiking (Miller et al. 2018)).
Below, we will use the theory of synergetics to provide a math-
ematical formulation of ephaptic coupling, that is, the interac-
tions between the ensemble electric field, Ee, and the average
transmembrane potential Vm. We will present some theoretical
arguments that motivate the hypothesis that a slow EF Ee acts as
a control parameter, which enslaves faster neural activity Vm. In
“Results,” we will test this hypothesis and ask whether ephaptic
coupling can be detected in in vivo neural data.
To describe extracellular field—transmembrane potential, Ee—
Vm, interactions, our starting point is equations that express
one quantity in terms of the other, that is, Ee in terms of Vm
and vice versa. These are Equations (4) and (5): the evolution
of transmembrane potential Vm in terms of the extracellular EP
Veis given by the ephaptic model (4). Also, Ve in terms of trans-
membrane potential Vm is given by the bidomain model (5). To
perform pen and paper calculations, we need algebraic equations
(i.e. equations without the inverse Fourier transform FT−1). Thus,
in Supplementary Material, we show how we one can rewrite
Equation (5) as a differential algebraic equation; see Equation (6)
below. For simplicity, we assume that the LFP electrode is at a
large distance compared with the size of the neural ensemble: the
radius a of the fiber separating the intra- and extra-cellular spaces
(gray cylinder) is very small compared with the vertical distance
y to the location of the LFP electrode, a << y, cf. squashed gray
cylinder in Fig. 1(D).
From trial to trial, the remembered stimulus changes. Thus, the
EP and the corresponding EF also change, see (Pinotsis and Miller
2022b) for details. Assuming a fixed-point attractor (steady state),
Equation (5) can be written as (see Supplementary Material for
details)

where τ −1
EP is the rate with which Ve decays to its resting value Ve
S.
Equation (6) expresses the dynamics of the extracellular EP
Vein terms of the transmembrane potential Vm. To describe inter-
actions between these potentials and the corresponding electric
fields, we then applied the “slaving principle” from synergetics
(Haken 1987). This predicts that control parameters evolve more
slowly and constrain order parameters and enslaved parts. Exam-
ples of the general slaving principle can be found in physics and
biology (Haken 2012). Haken and colleagues have shown that
varying the temperature (control parameter) of a fluid heated
from below, various spatial patterns of fluid molecules occur. Also,
that attention can be thought of as control variable in multi-stable
perception (Ditzinger and Haken 1989; Basar et al. 2012).
During working memory delay, the “slaving principle leads to
ephaptic coupling”: it predicts that extracellular EP, Ve, enslaves
neural activity described by the transmembrane potential Vm. To
confirm this, consider the following expansion of Vm and Ve in
terms of Fourier series

einx. Then, substituting
these expansions into Equations (4) and (6), we obtain evolution
equations for the Fourier coefficients or modes:

ξn and ψn are called the Fourier coefficients or modes of the
extracellular potential and neural activity. Below, we call them
modes. ξq0 are the values of the extracellular EP on the exterior
of the ensemble membrane (surface of gray cylinder in Fig. 1B).
Intuitively, a Fourier expansion implies that Vm and Ve are super-
positions of planar waves einx with amplitudes given by ξn and ψn.
We have replaced Equations (4) and (5) that describe the cou-
pling between the extracellular potential and neural activity, Ve
and Vm, by Equations (7) that describe the same coupling in
terms of modes. Note that in the second equation (7), the rate

of change of neural activity modes, ˙ψn, depends on values of the
extracellular potential modesξq0 on the exterior of the membrane
and exogenous stochastic input U.
We can now apply the slaving principle of synergetics. This
suggests that in Equations (7), one can distinguish between slow
and fast modes. Equations—as usual—provide a formalism and
motivate experimental tests, they cannot replace these tests.
In Pinotsis and Miller (2022b), we found that the electric field
was more stable than neural activity. Correlations of single trial
estimates of electric fields were higher than correlations of similar
neural activity estimates. One could thus assume that the field
modesξq0 are slow and the transmembrane potential modes ψn
are fast. An independent, theoretical argument in support of this
hypothesis is a common assumption in bio-electromagnetism
about the EF being quasi-static: the tissue impedance on top
of resistance (or more generally reactance) is assumed to be
negligible and electromagnetic propagation effects can be ignored
(Nunez 1998). In other words, the electric field is assumed to
be relaxing very slowly compared with quickly relaxing neural
activity. If that hypothesis holds, the damping constant for the
extracellular potential would be much smaller than the damping
constant for neural activity τ −1
NA >> τ −1
EP (adiabatic approximation;
Haken 1987).
Using synergetics and assuming τ −1
NA >> τ −1
EP , Equations (7)
suggest that the instantaneous values of fast relaxing quantities,
like the transmembrane potential modes ψn, depend on slowly
varying quantities, like the extracellular potential coefficients ξq0
above, which slave them (Haken 1987). Electric fields enslave
neural activity. This is ephaptic coupling formulated in the lan-
guage of synergetics—as a special case of the slaving principle.
Equations (7) are then the mathematical expression of ephaptic
coupling. In Haken (1987, 2012), several equations similar to (7)
are presented in the context of physics and biology and similar
coupling between fast and slow quantities is discussed.
Note that Equations (7) are “not” used for calculations in
“Results.” Had we used them in our calculations, we would
have had to prescribe the rate constants τ −1
NA, τ −1
EP a priori. This
would bias our conclusions. Equations (7) are useful because they
“motivate” a hypothesis that is tested in “Results”—independently
of Equations (7). This hypothesis is that electric field modes ξq0
are slow and neural activity modes ψn are fast.
Assuming that neural activity is enslaved by the electric field
has another implication. It suggests that instantaneous values
of neural activity are given in terms of instantaneous values of
the slower fields. During the delay period of the memory task
considered here, one can assume fixed point dynamics. In other
words, the transmembrane potential can be assumed to be in
equilibrium, thus |

0. Then, Equations (7) yield these
instantaneous values of neural activity determined by emerging
fields. One can express ψn in terms of ξn:

(8)
This equation describes how the fast modes of neural activity
are enslaved (driven) by the slow, “stable” modes of the electric
field.
To sum up, the slaving principle from synergetics predicts
that stable electric fields enslave neural activity. Mathemati-
cally, this result is expressed via Equations (8) and in neuro-
science it is called ephaptic coupling. The slaving principle distin-
guishes between stable and unstable quantities, like the modes ξn
and ψn. It suggests that the evolution of fast unstable modes is
determined by stable modes. The latter determine the instanta-
neous values of the former: here the electric field determines
neural activity, see Equation (8). This is also related to critical
slowing where some modes are strongly correlated over time (e.g.
Bassett and Bullmore 2009; Kitzbichler et al. 2009; Chialvo 2010),
see also Pinotsis and Miller 2022b).
Ephaptic coupling across engram complexes
The distinction between stable and unstable modes can be
obtained using a mathematical theory known as linear stability
analysis. Linear stability analysis of neural network models is
often used to express brain responses in terms of key anatomical
and biophysical parameters (e.g. Coombes 2005; Jirsa and Haken
1996; Pinotsis et al. 2013; Pinotsis and Friston 2010). It can also
be extended to include nonlinear terms (see Haken 1987; Basar
et al. 2012). Here, we use linear stability analysis to motivate
a hypothesis about engram storage in memory networks that
will be tested in “Results” that ephaptic coupling occurs across
engram complexes. “If ephaptic coupling occurs in a brain area
and this exchanges memory information with other brain areas
then ephaptic coupling will occur in those areas too.” Below, we
present mathematical argument in support of this hypothesis for
two areas. Generalization to an arbitrary number of areas can be
done by induction.
Consider two neural ensembles in brain areas (i) FEF and (ii)
SEF. Dynamics of ensemble activity are given by a system of neural
fields of the form of Equation (4). Similarly to Equation (4) above,
ephaptic coupling suggests Vjm depends on EP Vje
0 (its boundary
value at the membrane exterior) via the following expressions:

(9)
Here, W is the feedforward connectivity matrix whose entries
are weights that scale downstream input to SEF from FEF (Gross-
berg 1967; Wilson and Cowan 1973). Note that in “Results,” we
did “not” use predicted data from model (9). This is just used
here for mathematical analysis and formulating mathematical
arguments. In the linear stability regime, we can assume that
the transmembrane potential Vim of each ensemble (identified
by the upper index j = 1,2) includes perturbations in the form of
planar waves around baseline Vio, which is an equation of the form
Vjm ∼Vjo +eβt+ikx (Pinotsis and Friston 2010; Grindrod and Pinotsis
2011). For mathematical convenience, we consider a vector of
extracellular and transmembrane potential functions for the two
areas:

needed to faithfully represent the dynamics), can be found using
a model fitting procedure (e.g. maximum likelihood or similar)
using real data. We will consider this elsewhere. Since we here
focus on mathematical arguments, for simplicity, we assume that
the first two modes explain most of the observed variance, that is,

Substituting the above expression in Equations (9) and using
the first of Equations (7), we obtain a system of equations,
˙Φ = MΦ + nonlinear terms

in terms of
2 × 2 matrices E, L, G, and J also included in the Supplementary
Material. Equation (12) is a linearized system that describes the
coupling of extracellular and transmembrane potentials in the
two brain areas in terms of connectivity matrices between them.
Mathematically, for the system to have a solution, that is, for the
modes in all areas to exist, the determinant of the matrix M needs
to be different than zero, det(M) ̸= 0. Existence of a solution of a
linear system when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is
non zero is a standard result in Linear Algebra (Strang 2006). Note
that M is called the coefficient matrix of the linearized system
given by Equation (12).
But what does existence of solution mean? Intuitively, it means
that one can find functions that satisfy these equations. In other
words, this is just a mathematical tautology that there are some
functions ψ1
j , ξ 1
j and ψ2
j , ξ 2
j , that is, some extracellular and trans-
membrane potentials that can describe electrical activity in FEF
and SEF. The implied assumption here is that there is also a
feedforward connectivity matrix W (recall Equation 9) so that FEF
and SEF form an engram: there is input from one area to the other.
This is an assumption in our analysis (the areas form a memory
engram or network). To sum, Equation (12) and the condition
det(M) ̸= 0 are just a mathematical expression of the simple
fact that ensembles FEF and SEF are connected and generate
some activity and electric fields. By applying the identity det(M) =
det

det(D) (Abramowitz et al. 1988), we obtain
det(M) = det(A) det

det(J)
(13)
Thus, the condition det(M) ̸= 0 requires that det(J) ̸= 0 and
det(A) ̸= 0; the determinants of matrices J and A should also be
non zero. J is defined by

In other words, J is the matrix of coefficients in a linearized
system of equations describing the coupling between the sec-
ond extracellular and membrane potential modes in the second

(15)
Then, the condition det(J) ̸= 0 implies that the above system
has a solution, i.e. there are some functions (modes) that describe
the extracellular and transmembrane potentials. det(J) ̸= 0 also
includes some additional piece of information. This is due to the
similarity of these equations with Equations (7). In the previous
section, we found using synergetics that Equations (7) are the
mathematical expression of ephaptic coupling. Equations (15)
are the same as (7) when we consider the second order modes
(denoted by the lower index “2” in ξ 2
2 ) in the second area (SEF;
denoted by the upper index “2”). Thus, Equations (15) are the
mathematical expression of ephaptic coupling for second order
modes in the second area. In other words, if we assume that
Equations (15) hold (mathematically, a solution exists) the trans-
membrane and extracellular potential modes will be linked via
ephaptic coupling. Similarly, the condition det(A) ̸= 0 means
that the modes in the first area will also be linked via ephaptic
coupling.
We turn to Equation (13), which says that if the determinants
of the matrices M and J are non zero, then the determinant of
matrix A will also be non zero (the same is true if we replace J
by A). In mathematical notation, the following statement holds: if
det(M) ̸= 0 and det(J) ̸= 0, then det(A) ̸= 0. Above we saw what
each of these three conditions means. Following these earlier
interpretations, we can put the last mathematical statement into
words: Assuming that FEF and SEF are connected and generate
activity and electric fields (det(M) ̸= 0) and that there is ephaptic
coupling in the second area (det(J) ̸= 0), there will be ephaptic
coupling in the first area (det(A) ̸= 0; or the other way around,
where we replace J by A). In brief, assuming that ephaptic coupling
occurs in one area, then ephaptic coupling will also occur in the
other area. By induction, we can show the same result for an
arbitrary number of areas that form a memory network or engram
complex.
Granger Causality
To test for information transfer between different spatial scales
(emerging electric fields and neural activity) and brain areas (FEF
and SEF), we used GC (Granger 1969; Geweke 1982). GC quantifies
how the history (past samples) of variable A improve prediction
of unknown samples (future samples) of a different variable B.
It is based on generalized variances or log likelihood ratios that
quantify whether a regression model including variable A fits
future samples of variable B better than the restricted regression
model based on variable B samples only (Friston et al. 2013).
Following Barnett and Seth (2014),we evaluated GC as follows:
we first used model-based VAR modeling to calculate regression
coefficients from our data, similar to a discrete stationary vector
stochastic process. First, one determines an appropriate order of
a VAR model using an information criterion or cross-validation
(Burnham and Anderson 1998). Then, a log-likelihood ratio FA→B of
residual covariance matrices is computed. This corresponds to the
full and restricted VAR models and quantifies the “GC strength,”
that is, whether the prediction of future values of the variable B
improves significantly after including past values of A. This can
be computed using Granger’s F-test for univariate problems or
a chi-square test for a large number of variables (Granger 1969;
Geweke 1982). GC is often used for the analysis of time series
(samples are obtained using measurements at different moments
in time). Here, we used GC after considering spatial samples, that
is, we obtained measurements at different locations in the neural
ensemble and extracellular space. This is discussed further in
“Results.”
Representation similarity analysis
We used RSA (Kriegeskorte et al. 2008) to assess the similarity
of information representation across different brain areas. RSA

Cerebral Cortex, 2023
uses dissimilarity matrices (DMs) to summarize how stimulus
information is represented by brain responses. Following (Pinot-
sis et al. 2019), we built DMs based on time correlations that
are thought to underlie working memory representations (Wallis
et al. 2015; Inagaki et al. 2017). Each DM entry contained the
dissimilarity between trials corresponding to different remem-
bered cued locations. Thus, DMs describe pairwise differences
in patterns of neural activity corresponding to different stimuli.
To understand whether similar information (cued location) was
encoded in different brain areas, we computed the dissimilar-
ity between brain DMs. Following Kriegeskorte et al. (2008), the
dissimilarity between DMs, known as deviation, was the corre-
lation distance (1- Spearman correlation; Spearman was used
as it does not require a linear correspondence between these
matrices contrary to Pearson correlation). Deviations between
DMs quantify matches between representation content of brain
responses (Kriegeskorte 2011). They measure the correlation dis-
tance between each DM and quantify differences of differences:
how different are the corresponding pairwise differences in neural
activity or electric fields. After calculating deviations of DM matri-
ces, one can assess significant correspondence between informa-
tion stored in different brain areas (Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte
2017; Peterson et al. 2018).
Results
Ephaptic coupling in in vivo memory delay data
We first asked whether we could find evidence for ephaptic
coupling in our data. We examined in vivo LFPs acquired from FEF
and SEF during delay in a spatial WM task (Jia et al. 2017; Pinotsis
et al. 2017). In (Pinotsis and Miller (2022b), we analyzed the same
data from FEF only. Here we extended our analyses to the FEF-SEF
memory network (engram complex).
To assess evidence of ephaptic coupling in our data we used
computational modeling. We considered two variants of the same
model: with and without ephaptic effects (ephaptic and non
ephaptic). First, we fitted the models to LFP data and compared
their fits. Second, we used model predictions and GC to assess
evidence of ephaptic effects. This is discussed in the next section.
Below, we discuss computational models and their fits.
In an earlier work (Pinotsis et al. 2017), we obtained predic-
tions of the activity of neural ensembles maintaining different
cued locations. Transmembrane depolarization was described by
a neural field model trained as an autoencoder, which we called
a “deep” neural field. The term “deep” reflects the bottleneck
architecture of the ReML algorithm used for training. The model
was trained using the same LFP dataset as that considered in the
analyses below. We used different parts of the dataset for fitting
and training, see “Methods” for details.
Here, we obtained new predictions of the activity of neural
ensembles by extending the model of Pinotsis et al. (2017) to
include ephaptic coupling (“Methods”); see also Goldwyn et al.
(2017). In other words, our analyses below used two sets of pre-
dictions of neural activity: with and without ephaptic coupling.
Predictions without ephaptic coupling were obtained in Pinotsis
et al. (2017). Predictions of neural activity with ephaptic coupling
were obtained here following (Danner et al. 2011; Goldwyn et al.
2017). These were obtained in two steps: first, we calculated the
extracellular electric potential generated by the neural ensemble
using a model from bioelectromagnetism (bidomain model) intro-
duced in (Pinotsis and Miller 2022), see also (Mc Laughlin et al.
2010; Goldwyn et al. 2017). Second, we added an ephaptic current
to the local recurrent input to the neural ensemble that changed
ensemble activity. The ephaptic current was an additional current
resulting from effects of the extracellular electric potential near
the ensemble.
To look for evidence of ephaptic coupling, we fitted the pre-
dictions of the ephaptic and non ephaptic models to LFP data and
evaluated goodness of their fits. Model parameters were the same
as in Pinotsis et al. (2017) and Pinotsis and Miller (2022b). These
are included in the Supplementary Table 1. We used BMC (Friston
et al. 2007; Friston 2008; Pinotsis et al. 2014) to find the model
that fit the data best (Pinotsis et al. 2018). The ReML algorithm
was used for fitting (Friston 2008). We also used previously unseen
data (data not used for training) to avoid data leakage.
We compared the evidence of the two models (how well a
model could explain the data), the ephaptic and the non ephaptic.
If the fit of the ephaptic model was better, this would provide
evidence of ephaptic coupling under the assumption that models
are plausible. The validity of the original neural field model (with-
out ephaptic coupling) has been assessed previously: variance
explained by the model was about 40%; see Supplementary Fig.
3(A) and (Pinotsis et al. 2017). In Pinotsis and Miller (2022), we
also showed that the model obtained the same neural ensemble
connectivity as that obtained using two independent methods: k-
means clustering (Humphries 2011) and high dimensional SVD
(Carroll and Chang 1970; Williams et al. 2018). The above results
support the validity of the original model (non ephaptic). We will
return to the validity of the extended model (ephaptic model),
after we discuss the results of model fits and comparison below.
To compare models and evaluate their fits, we used model
evidence. This was computed using a Free Energy approximation.
Free Energy is a cost function borrowed from autoencoders that
we used to measure goodness of fit. Inference used single trial
data and the principal axes as input to infer connectivity, simi-
lar to Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and other model fitting
approaches (Freestone et al. 2014; Oesterle et al. 2020; Pinotsis
et al. 2012). Having obtained the Free Energy, one can computer
the Bayes factor (BF; Kass and Raftery 1995). BF > 3 suggests that
the model with the higher Free Energy explains the data better.
BF can be thought of as a probabilistic analogue of the odds
ratio used in frequentist statistics. This corresponds to a posterior
probability of 95% for the winning model. Here, BF describes how
likely is the ephaptic model to have generated the sampled LFPs
compared with the non ephaptic model, under a fixed effects
assumption (same model for all trials).
BF results are shown in Fig. 2(A) (vertical axis). These are aver-
aged over trials for each cued location. The horizontal axis shows
the six different locations (angles) cued to hold in working mem-
ory. Black bars denote the BF after fitting FEF data, whereas
gray bars after fitting SEF data. A positive BF implies that the
non ephaptic model was more likely; a negative BF that the
ephaptic model was. The arrow at the right-hand side of Fig. 2(A)
facing upwards includes the letters NE = non ephaptic, whereas
the downwards facing arrow, the letter E = ephaptic wins. BF bars
pointing “downwards” provides evidence of ephaptic coupling.
Using model comparison, we found that in FEF, the ephaptic
model was more likely for cued locations at θ = 60, 80, 240, and
300◦(BF = −120, 70, 45, and 55, respectively; black bars in Fig. 2A).
To make sure the ephaptic model fitted single trial data better,
Fig. 2(B) shows the BF for individual trials for θ = 60, 180, 240, and
300◦, i.e. when the ephaptic model was more likely in FEF (results
for other angles are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5A). Average
BF estimates reported in Fig. 2(A) are not driven by outliers. We
confirmed that the ephaptic model was better in most trials.
BF estimates are within BF = 20–310 for θ = 60◦, BF = 10–200 for

Fig. 2. A) BF for different cued locations (horizontal axis). Blue bars denote the BF after fitting FEF data, while red bars after fitting SEF data. A positive
BF implies that the non ephaptic model was more likely; a negative BF that the ephaptic model was. BF bars pointing “downwards” provides evidence
of ephaptic coupling, denoted by the E inside the lower arrow. NE in the upper arrow stands for “non-ephaptic.” B) BF for individual trials and specific
cued angles when the ephaptic model wins. Different trials are shown on the horizontal axis. The corresponding cued angles are shown at the top right
corner of each plot. The ephaptic model fits the data better for most trials.
θ = 180◦and 249◦, and BF = 5–220 for θ = 300◦. In SEF (gray bars
in Fig. 2A), the ephaptic model was more likely for θ = 60◦and
300◦(BF = −10 and 20, respectively) (As expected, the complexity
of both models was very similar, see Supplementary Fig. 2C, which
shows the difference in complexity between models. All estimates
are between 0 and 0.6, which is less than 0.5% of the BF factor
shown in Fig. 2A. Note also that for θ = 0◦, the non ephaptic model
was more likely.
Individual trial data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5(B).
Although results were robust over trials, we did not find evidence
of ephaptic coupling across all cued locations. Thus, we then
asked why there is evidence in favor of ephaptic coupling for some
cued locations and not others. Either there was no ephaptic cou-
pling in these cases or the model overfitted. The first explanation
is refuted by the results of the next section that assesses evidence
of ephaptic coupling using a different method, GC. The second
explanation is consistent with these results and also follows from
a careful consideration of model predictions—which also reveals
limitations of the non ephaptic model.
We saw above that the original model was found to predict neu-
ral activity and connectivity when tested against the LFP data and
other methods (Briefly, it explained 40% of the variance and found
the same connectivity for ensembles maintained cued locations,
see above.). The ephaptic model includes small perturbations of
transmembrane potentials due to extracellular field effects. We
thus focused on these perturbations that we call ephaptic effects
(on neural activity). To find them, we subtracted the predictions of
the non ephaptic model from the corresponding predictions of the
ephaptic model (averaged over trials). The models predict fluctu-
ations of neural activity around baseline because of endogenous
noise driving the neural ensemble in the form of transient non
Turing patterns (patterns that decay back to baseline).
Ephaptic effects are included in Supplementary Fig. 1. Supple-
mentary Fig. 1(A) (left) shows the relative percent changes due
to the ephaptic coupling for FEF. Similarly, Supplementary Fig. 1B
(right) shows the corresponding relative changes for SEF. There
are six panels in each figure, each corresponding to a different
cued location (angle). This is shown in bottom right of each panel,
e.g. the top left panel corresponds to cued location θ = 0◦. The
vertical panel axes show the relative change in principal axis
strength with respect to the original principal axis, after including
ephaptic coupling. The horizontal panel axes show time in ms.
Ephaptic effects (amplitudes of neural activity) are expressed as
relative increases in amplitude with respect to fluctuations when
ephaptic coupling is not considered (i.e. predictions of the non
ephaptic, original model). A positive relative change of α% implies
that the amplitude of neural activity is α% larger (or smaller if the
change is negative).
Comparing Fig. 2(A) and Supplementary Fig. 1, we concluded
that the ephaptic model explained the FEF data better only when
ephaptic effects were small, i.e. below 40% and cued locations at
θ = 60◦, 180◦, 240◦. Effects for the case of the remaining two cued
locations for θ = 0◦and 120◦are up to 200% (two times larger).
Small ephaptic effects suggest that potential modulations do not
alter the homeostatic stable point and the excitation to inhibition
balance is maintained (Turrigiano 2011). This also ensures the
ephaptic model is operating within its stable (linear) regime. Sim-
ilarly, the model explained the SEF data better for cued locations
at θ = 0◦, 60◦, and 300◦when effects were small, i.e. below 6%
relative change. For the remaining cued locations at θ = 120◦, 180◦,
and 240◦, ephaptic effects were up to 600% (six times larger). This
suggests that the ephaptic model overfitted large fluctuations—
which can be explained from the linearity assumption (Taylor
expansion) inherent in its derivation (see Supplementary Material
and Pinotsis et al. 2017).
Below, we did not use the ephaptic model any further. This
was only used again in “Methods” to carry out a pen and paper
i.e. analytical, derivation of Equations (7) and (12). It was used
to formulate mathematical arguments in support of hypothe-
ses tested in “Results” (see “Methods”). Below, we only used the
original, non ephaptic model and GC. GC allowed us to test for
“nonlinear” interactions between the electric fields and neural
activity. This was a second way to assess if there is evidence of
in vivo ephaptic coupling in our LFP data (the first was model
comparison above). Crucially, GC also allowed us to obtain the
directionality of these interactions. Comparing models above,
did not directly assess directionality. We turn to GC analyses
below.
Top down information transfer from emerging
electric fields to neuronal ensembles
Above, we found that, when endogenous fluctuations were small
(fractions of fluctuations of membrane potential around base-
line), a model in which neural ensemble activity is coupled to
the electric field (ephaptic model) explained the LFP data bet-
ter than a model without ephaptic coupling. We next tested
for ephaptic coupling more generally, during large endogenous
fluctuations. To do so, we used predictions of neural activity

from the non ephaptic model considered earlier and GC (see
also “Methods”). GC is a data-driven method for determining the
directionality of information flow between stochastic variables
(Granger 1969). Crucially, GC provides the directionality of the
interactions between the electric field and neural activity. In other
words, GC allows us to test whether the electric field guides
neural activity or the other way around. In Pinotsis and Miller
(2022), we suggested that electric fields can act as “guard rails”
that funnel the higher dimensional variable neural activity along
stable lower-dimensional routes. Here, we tested this hypothesis
directly using GC.
Besides the non ephaptic model that gave us predictions of
neural activity (Equation 1), we also used a model of the electric
field, known as the bidomain model, see Equation (5) and relevant
discussion in “Methods” and Supplementary Material for details.
Model parameters for both models are included in Supplementary
Table 1. This model provides predictions of the electric field gen-
erated by neural ensembles maintaining different cued locations.
This is the near field in extracellular space, in the vicinity of the
brain tissue occupied by the neural ensemble. Taken together, the
non ephaptic and the bidomain model provide two time series, one
for predictions of neural activity and another for electric fields.
We used the non ephaptic model to get neural activity because its
predictions were shown to explain a large part of data variance
and to correlate with other methods (see the previous section and
footnote 3). Also, the model does “not” a priori assume ephaptic
coupling, to avoid biasing results. As with any model, it is just an
approximation of the observed neural activity—and similarly for
the electric field model. Possible interactions between predictions
of the neural and electric field models suggest that such inter-
actions could occur in the brain too. Also, the use of GC allowed
us to assess nonlinear interactions not considered in the BMC
above. Note that we did not use Equations (7) for our results below
(because they include rate constants τ −1
NA, τ −1
EP
and prescribing
them a priori would bias our conclusions; see the discussion
in “Methods”). We just used the models given by Equations (1)
and (5).
Having obtained two time series for neural activity and electric
fields, we assessed causal interactions between them using GC. In
its common use, GC is applied to time series data and assesses
whether knowing the past of one variable (A) helps predict the
future of another variable (B) better than just using the past of B
alone. If so, one concludes that information flows from variable A
to B. Flow is thought to occur over time, similarly to the flow of a
water molecule that flows in a river. In neuroscience, GC is used to
describe how information flows in the brain, using sampled time
series from different areas (Barnett and Seth 2014).
One way to compute GC is by first calculating the covariance
function, that is, how strongly a time series is related to itself or
another time series. This requires p samples, that is, measure-
ments at p time steps earlier or later (Friston et al. 2013). Implicit
in this calculation, there is an assumption of finite p, or, that the
information flows at a “finite speed” from the variable A to B.
Here, we focused on the information flow between the electric
field and neural activity (i.e. the electric field and neural activity
are the variables A and B). It is well known that interactions
involving the electric field transfer information very close to the
speed of light, which is practically “infinite.” Thus, the assumption
of finite velocity inherent in GC analyses does not hold here.
See also the discussion in “Methods” and Equation (8). There
we presented some theoretical arguments based on the slaving
principle from complex systems theory (Haken 1987, 2006). This
suggests that instantaneous values of neural activity would be
determined by electric fields, and interactions would happen at
the speed of light.
Thus, our GC analysis should be able to deal with field effects
being transmitted with practically infinite velocity. This is similar
to applications in geophysics where GC and recordings of the
earth’s gravitational field are used to, e.g. find what kind of
minerals exist deep below the surface (Marques et al. 2019). Here,
the emerging electric field contains instantaneous information
about neural activity in the same way that the gravitational field
contains instantaneous information about the masses of minerals
underneath. We used this idea from geophysics after replacing
the gravitational with the electric field and mineral masses with
neural activity.
Because of the practically infinite speed of information prop-
agation (there can be no past or future in time series data of
electric field recordings), we followed a slightly unusual GC anal-
ysis where we replaced time with space samples. We considered
snapshots of time series and computed the GC over space. We
used data from a single time point. Each snapshot corresponded
to each time point of the time series. Data included the spatial
profiles of neural activity and contemporaneous electric field
snapshots. We arbitrarily chose one edge of the cortical patch
as its beginning and the other as its end. Starting from the
beginning, we included all past locations (similar to classical
GC where past time points are used) and asked whether know-
ing the electric field helps predict the value of neural activity
in a neighboring (“future” or unknown) location, where activ-
ity had not been measured yet, better than using recordings of
neural activity alone. This is the same idea as in common GC,
where we have replaced time with space. GC measures interac-
tions between time series in both directions; thus, our analyses
answered the reverse question too: whether knowing neural activ-
ity helps predict the electric field. Our analyses are summarized
in Fig. 3.
Following Barnett and Seth (2014), we used an F-test to assess
CG strength “(Methods).” First, using LFPs from FEF, we calculated
the GC strength and averaged across all time points. Results are
shown in Fig. 3(A) for θ = 120◦. The top right quadrant (from field
to activity) has a GC strength of GC = 7.83, whereas the bottom left
(from activity to field) has a GC strength of GC = 0.04. Results for
other angles are very similar (not shown).
Figure 3(B) shows F-test significance in the field to activity
direction for all cued locations. Recall that we tested GC for each
time point separately and used snapshots. Time points are shown
on the vertical axis and cued locations on the horizontal. All
entries are white (i.e. equal to 1, depicting a logical variable, sig-
nificant = true), which means that the corresponding GC strengths
across all time points and cued locations were significant. Field-
to-activity interactions were significant across all time points
and angles. Examples of individual GC strengths corresponding
to each time point during delay for θ = 120 and 60◦, are shown
in Fig. 3(C)–(F) for FEF and Fig. 3(G)–(J) for SEF. GC strengths are
shown on the vertical axis and time points on the horizontal. The
number of time points is equal to the length of the available time
series data. Field to activity GC strengths are shown in panels C, E,
G, and I, whereas activity to field GC strengths in panels D, F, H, and
J. In FEF, field to activity GC strengths range between GC = 6.42–
7.86 (θ = 120◦) and 6.41–7.98 (θ = 60◦). Activity to field GC strengths
range between GC = 0.01–0.08 (θ = 120degrees) and GC = 0.01–0.06
(θ = 60◦). Results for SEF were very similar: field to activity GC
strengths range between GC = 6.45–8.19 (θ = 120◦) and 6.76–8.04 (θ
= 60◦). Activity to field GC strengths range between GC = 0.01–0.07
(θ = 120◦) and 0.01–0.08 (θ = 60◦).

all time points and cued locations that were maintained. C–F) examples of individual GC strengths corresponding to each time point during delay for
cued locations at θ = 120 and (θ = 60◦◦, computed using FEF data. G–J) similar to C–F above, for SEF data. K) Coefficients of variation for GC strengths
(vertical axis) for all remembered cued locations (horizontal axis) computed using FEF data. Gray bars depict variability in field-to-activity GC strengths
and black bars depict variability in activity-to-field GC strengths.
All in all, the above results suggest that across all remembered
cued locations, GC was much larger in the field to activity than the
reverse direction in both FEF and SEF. This confirms our earlier
results about in vivo ephaptic coupling in memory ensembles
using BMC and extends them for all stimuli. The electric field
drives the neural activity. It funnels the high-dimensional varying
neural activity along stable lower dimensional routes—as sug-
gested in Pinotsis and Miller (2022).
Another result from Pinotsis and Miller (2022) was that electric
fields were more stable than neural activity. This was confirmed
here using GC analysis. Comparing GC strengths in the field to
activity vs activity to field direction in Fig. 3(C)–(J) (both FEF and
SEF results), we observed that activity-to-field GC strengths varied
more over time than field-to-activity GC strengths. This difference
in temporal variability between electric field and neural activity is
formally assessed using coefficients of variation (CV). Figure 3(K)
shows the CVs for GC strengths (vertical axis) for all remembered
cued locations (horizontal axis) using FEF recordings. Gray bars
depict variability in field-to-activity GC strengths and black bars
depict variability in activity-to-field GC strengths. We found that
variability was much higher in the activity-to-field direction. Black
bars corresponding to different cued locations were much larger
(CV = 28–47%) than gray bars (CV = 2–4%). Results for SEF were
similar. This suggests that neural activity is more variable than
the electric field which is in agreement with (Pinotsis and Miller
2022). This is also reminiscent of Wieners “virtual governors” in
cybernetics and the theory of synergetics considered below and
in the Discussion.
Ephaptic coupling and the stability of the electric field found
here (using coefficients of variation based on GC) follows also
from the theory of synergetics. The theory suggests that order
parameters,like the electric field,affect enslaved parts,like neural
activity (ephaptic coupling). Synergetics also suggests that control
parameters (fields) are also more stable than enslaved parts (neu-
ral activity). See “Methods” for some mathematical arguments in
support of this result.
Electric fields guide information transfer in
engram complexes
Next, we considered causal interactions between electric fields
and neural activity in engram complexes across cortical areas.
Recall that such complexes include brain areas that maintain
memories (neural ensembles; Tonegawa et al. 2015a) connected
via mono- or poly-synaptic connections. We examined engrams
formed by FEF and SEF ensembles in our spatial delay response
task. We studied information transfer between these brain areas
using GC. The analyses below are like those in the previous
section. The difference is that below, variables A and B are electric
fields (or neural activity) from “different” brain areas, as opposed
to the same areas considered above. We used predictions of neural
activity and electric fields obtained by the non ephaptic and the
bidomain models and assessed interactions between them, as
before.
We first computed the GC strength based on electric fields in
FEF and SEF. This is shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding results
based on neural activity are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. We
first considered at which exact time points interactions between
the two areas were significant. These time points are shown
in Fig. 4(A) and (B). Figure 4(A) shows significant interactions in
white for all cued locations in the FEF to SEF direction. Remem-
bered cued locations are shown on the horizontal axis while
time points on the vertical. Figure 4(B) has the same format as
4A and shows the corresponding results in the opposite, SEF to
FEF direction. For example, for θ = 0◦◦, significant electric field
interactions in the FEF to SEF direction were observed at sparse
intervals between times t = 290–310 ms and around t = 690 ms

Correlations (left panel) and P-values (right panel) between FEF principal axes and temporal windows during which GC field interactions from FEF to
SEF were significant. Principal axes are shown on the vertical axis (from first to fourth as we move downwards) and cued locations on the horizontal
axis. E) Similar to (D) for SEF principal axes.
(white lines in the first column of Fig. 4A). In the SEF to FEF
direction, such interactions were found around t = 310, 540, 490,
540, and 680 ms (Fig. 4B).
Example field-to-field GC strengths for a cued location at θ =
120◦are shown in Fig. 4(C). FEF to SEF field GC strengths are shown
in the left panel. GC strengths in the reverse direction are shown in
the right panel. GC strengths are on the vertical axis. Time points
are on the horizontal axis. Strengths have similar ranges in both
directions during the delay period. We found similar results using
neural activity (Supplementary Fig. 2). Like the results based on
electric fields discussed above, Supplementary Fig. 2(A) and (B)
reveals temporal windows of information transfer between FEF
and SEF at the neural activity level. Supplementary Figure 2(C)
shows GC strengths in both directions. Interactions at the level of
neural activity are expected: we found above that electric fields
guide neural activity and that there were significant interactions
between FEF and SEF electric fields. GC interactions at the level of
neural activity are sparser than the corresponding GC strengths
at the electric field level and this is replicated across all cued
angles (results not shown). There are fewer lines in the left and
right panels of Supplementary Fig. 2(C) compared with Fig. 4(C).
At several time points, GC strengths based on neural activity were
zero, while GC strengths based on fields were not. This confirms
the stability and robustness of the electric field found above and
in our earlier work.
Are the temporal windows during which significant electric
field interactions occur related to neural activity fluctuations? If
so, this would mean that the dynamics (fluctuations) of neural
ensembles in FEF and SEF are linked to the information transfer
between them. This is what we tested next. We asked whether the
temporal profile of significant field interactions found using GC
above (white lines in Fig. 4A and B) follows the neural dynamics
in each brain area. Our hypothesis was that significant field
interactions would occur, whereas neural activity fluctuations
were relatively large. We thus looked for correlations between
the temporal windows (epochs) during which GC significant field
interactions took place and neural activity.
Our hypothesis was that ephaptic interactions would be sen-
sitive to both the amplitude and the spatial extent (scale) of
neural activity. This is motivated by the fact that larger ampli-
tudes would increase SNR and functional connectivity is known
to be expressed within certain frequency bands. This is known
as Communication-through-Coherence (CTC) hypothesis (Fries
2015). In Pinotsis et al. (2017), we showed that functional con-
nectivity in certain bands can be described by the “principal
axes” of our model, see “Methods” and Pinotsis et al. (2017). The
axes provide approximations of the fluctuations of neural activity
around baseline at different spatial scales. They are matrices of
dimensionality number of time samples “by” the number of trials.
They describe the instantaneous contribution to the recorded LFP
data averaged over electrodes. To test whether there was any rela-
tion between the timings at which GC interactions occurred and
neural activity, we computed the correlations between the first,
second, third, and fourth principal axes and the epochs during
which field GC was significant. As the order of axes increased, the
spatial scale of neural activity described by them decreased, see
“Methods” and Pinotsis et al. (2017) for details.
In Fig. 4(D), we show correlations (left panel) and the corre-
sponding P-values (right panel) between FEF principal axes and
temporal windows during which electric field GC interactions
from FEF to SEF were significant. Principal axes are shown on
the vertical axis (from first to fourth as we move downwards)
and cued locations on the horizontal axis. Figure 4C includes the
corresponding results for SEF principal axes. Different shades of
gray depict P-values. These correspond to different significance
levels—where we have lumped together all P-values above the
significance threshold (P = 0.05) and shown them in white. The
same visualization is followed in Fig. 4(E) and Supplementary
Fig. 2(D) and E. In brief, white entries denote non significant
correlations in these figures.

Overall, for both FEF and SEF and all cued angles, the temporal
windows during which FEF to SEF CG strengths were signifi-
cant, correlated with principal axes, i.e. endogenous fluctuations
around baseline. P-values in each column (cued location) in the
right panels in Fig. 4(D) and e includes non white, i.e. significant
correlations. Interestingly, this was not the case for GC strengths
based on neural activity (Supplementary Fig. 2D and E). For cer-
tain angles, there were no significant correlations between GC
strengths based on neural activity and fluctuations (principal
axes). This was the case for correlations with FEF axes for θ = 0◦
(right panel in Supplementary Fig. 2D) and with SEF axes for θ =
180◦and 240◦(right panel in Supplementary Fig. 2E). Thus, fluc-
tuations of neural activity do not result in information exchange
between areas as efficiently as this is done via fields. This suggests
that fields are more stable (i.e. include less noise) than neural
activity. It is also in accord with earlier results that found that
between area GC interactions mediated by neural activity are
smaller and sparser compared with interactions mediated by
fields (compare Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 2C). It follows
from the theory of bioelectromagnetism from physics. Across
like trials, where the same memory was maintained, the inputs
entering a given network changed. Bioelectromagnetism suggests
that neurons, proteins, and other structures in the extracellular
matrix will vary and reconfigure themselves to accommodate
these inputs but the overall electric field will be stable (Perkins
and Perkins 2000; Pinotsis et al. 2023).
To sum up, we found that fluctuations around baseline activity
in both areas correlated with the temporal windows of signifi-
cant field GC interactions. The evolution of information transfer
between FEF and SEF follows the dynamics of the neural ensem-
bles in these areas. The link between information transfer (sig-
nificant GC windows) and neural dynamics appeared stronger at
the level of electric fields. The above results suggest that electric
fields are more stable than neural activity.
Above we found significant interactions at the level of electric
fields in both directions between FEF and SEF (Fig. 4A and B). We
also found that interactions in the FEF to SEF direction followed
the dynamics of neural ensembles (Fig. 4D and E). Interestingly,
interactions for several cued locations GC strengths in the reverse
direction were non significant. Supplementary Fig. 3(B) (left panel)
shows this was the case for FEF fluctuations and cued locations at
θ = 180◦, 240◦, and 300◦. The right panel in the same figure shows
absence of significant correlations with SEF fluctuations (SEF
axes) for θ = 120◦, 180◦, and 240◦. This suggests that information
flow in the memory network seems to follow FEF, not SEF neural
ensemble activity. This is in agreement with studies showing that
although both FEF and SEF neurons increase their discharge rate
before saccade initiation, it is FEF, not SEF, activity that initiates
saccades (Stuphorn et al. 2010). SEF activity at the same time
includes both information flowing out from SEF and reverberating
delay activity in the FEF-SEF network.
The same memory is stored by electric fields in
different brain areas
In the previous section, we used GC and found that information
was transferred between brain areas, FEF and SEF, during memory
maintenance. Our hypothesis was that data were recorded from
neural ensembles, i.e. sites that are part of engram complexes
across brain areas.
To confirm this, we asked whether representations in each
site corresponded to the same memory. To test for similarity
between information content, we used “Representation Similarity
Analysis” (RSA; Kriegeskorte et al. 2008, “Methods”). First, one
constructs DMs based on correlation distance to evaluate the
similarity between memory representations. DMs describe pair-
wise differences in patterns of neural activity or electric fields
corresponding to different cued locations. In turn, correlation
distances between DMs, known as deviations, express second-
order differences, that is, differences in pairwise differences in
neural activity or electric fields in different brain areas for the
same cued locations. We used deviations to test for significant
correspondence between memory representations (Diedrichsen
and Kriegeskorte 2017; Peterson et al. 2018; Pinotsis et al. 2019).
We first constructed DMs for FEF and SEF based on three
different sets of data: electric fields, LFPs and neural activity.
Fields and activity were reconstructed using our model “(Meth-
ods).” Our results are shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4.
Figure 5(A) and (B) includes the DMs for FEF and SEF electric fields,
respectively. Figure 5(C) and (D) include the corresponding RDMs
based on LFPs and Supplementary Fig. 4(A) and (B) include RDMs
based on neural activity. Different colors correspond to different
dissimilarities (1-correlation) for each of the six possible cued
locations.
Correlations were computed between trials corresponding to
the same stimulus for all possible stimulus pairs after averaging
over time. The higher the dissimilarity the more variability in the
way information is represented. In other words, DMs illustrate the
geometry of stimulus space, that is, how different cued locations
are distributed into the space spanned by the activity of the
underlying neural ensemble or its electric field. This provides a
visualization of how dynamics in different brain areas represent
memories. It can reveal clusters implying categorical representa-
tions or smooth variations along stimulus dimensions that link
to behavior. The overall structure of matrices in Fig. 5(A) and (B)
describes how the electric field representations differ between
pairs of cued angles. Diagonal terms have zero dissimilarity as
expected. Representations were different between stimuli (red
and yellow entries, d ≥0.4). This is also the case for other RDMs
in Fig. 5(C) and (D) as well as Supplementary Fig. 4(A) and (B).
Interestingly, FEF RDMs based on electric field and neural activity
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. 4A) show a lattice structure:
representations corresponding to the upper (θ = 0◦, 60◦, and
120◦) and lower (θ = 180◦, 240◦, and 300◦) hemifield form distinct
clusters, shown by ellipses. This is reminiscent of topographic
clustering in FEF, which is known to contain topographically orga-
nized responses and visual map (Funahashi et al. 1989; Thompson
and Bichot 2005). It is also in accord with a similar organization
of functional and effective connectivity found using the same
dataset in Pinotsis et al. (2017a).
To confirm that representations contained the same memories,
we then computed the deviations between DMs (Kriegeskorte
et al. 2008; Pinotsis et al. 2019). Our results are shown in Fig. 5(E).
Deviation is a second-order correlation distance, that is, the dis-
tance between correlation distances shown in DMs. It allows us
to quantify matches between memory representations in the two
areas. The smaller the deviation the closer the match. To test
whether two DMs were related, we used the fixed-effects random-
ization test. We simulated the null distribution by reordering rows
(10,000 relabelings) and obtained a distribution of correlations
(the null hypothesis is that the two DMs were unrelated). If the
actual correlation we had obtained fall within the top 5% of the
simulated null distribution, then we reject the null hypothesis:
the two DMs are related. Figure 5E shows that the deviation for
electric fields was larger (d ≈0.5) than that computed using
neural activity (d ≈0.3), which, in turn, is larger than the deviation
computed using LFPs (d ≈0.2). Crucially, the randomization test

reveals that only the DMs based on electric fields are signifi-
cantly related (denoted by an asterisk above the leftmost bar in
Fig. 5E; significant deviations at the P < 0.05 level). The significant
relationship between DMs based on electric fields suggests that
memory representations contain unique information associated
with different memories. This is in accord with earlier results from
Pinotsis and Miller (2022) obtained using the same data, which
found that classification accuracy was higher when electric fields
were used as features compared with neural activity. They also
found that confusion matrices based on fields had more correctly
classified trials. In Fig. 5(E), error bars denote the standard errors.
They depict the variability of deviations (had we chosen different
stimuli from the same population; n = 100, see Kriegeskorte et al.
2008).
To sum, we found significantly related DMs in FEF and SEF
computed using electric fields, but not LFPs or reconstructed
neural activity. This suggests that memory representations in the
two areas, known as engrams, are linked at the electric field level.
Crucially, these similarities in memory representations across two
areas were not apparent in LFP recordings. Taken together with
our earlier result that emerging electric fields seem to guide
information transfer, our result here suggests that electric fields
could mediate the transfer of memories and their latent states
between brain areas. Ephaptic interactions occur in areas where
engrams are found. See “Methods” for mathematical arguments
supporting this result.
Discussion
We found evidence for in vivo ephaptic coupling from two cortical
areas, the FEF and SEF, during performance of a spatial delayed
response task. We found that ephaptic coupling from bioelectrical
fields is causative, it influences neural activity, sculpting and
guiding it to form engram complexes. These are near fields very
close to the brain tissue. We found that, in each brain area,
information was transferred from bioelectric fields to neurons.
Also, stable, robust fields allowed for memory transfer between
FEF and SEF engrams. Neural activity appeared to contain less
information and was more variable. In short, like a conductor of
an orchestra, where neurons are the musicians, the bioelectric
field influences each neuron and orchestrates the engram, the
symphony.
To demonstrate ephaptic effects, we used biophysical modeling
and GC. We used a model that can describe neural ensemble
connectivity, synaptic filtering, and electric fields. In previous
work, we estimated the effective connectivity in neural ensembles
and their electric fields (Pinotsis et al. 2017a; Pinotsis and Miller
2022). We found that electric fields carry stimulus information,
are robust and can act as “guardrails” that stabilize and funnel
the underlying neural activity. We showed that fields were more
stable than neural activity and could be used to decode remem-
bered cued locations better.
Here, we used the same model and tested whether including
ephaptic effects resulted in better fits to LFP data. The model
was used for both learning and inference. It first learned the
connectivity parameters. These were subsequently used as priors
to reconstruct single trial neural activity and bioelectric field
estimates. This revealed ephaptic effects when endogenous fluc-
tuations were small, as expected from the linearity assumption
of our model. GC applied to time snapshots confirmed these
ephaptic effects during large endogenous fluctuations and also
allowed us to determine directionality.
Our results were consistent with the communication through
coherence hypothesis (CTC (Fries 2015)). According to CTC, neural
ensembles synchronize in a way that creates bursts of excitation
and inhibition and allows information to propagate from one

15
area to the other during certain temporal windows. We took CTC
one step further to suggest that this communication is guided
by emerging electric fields. First, we found that between area
GC strengths based on fields were larger than the corresponding
estimates based on neural activity. Second, for each brain area,
GC strengths were much larger in the field-to-activity than in
the reverse direction. Third, the temporal windows during which
FEF to SEF interactions take place followed the dynamics of
neural ensembles in these areas. Taken together, the above results
suggest that electric fields guide information transfer between
areas.
The last result, that fluctuations around baseline in FEF and
SEF correlated with the temporal windows of significant field GC
interactions, suggests a circular causality between neural sources
and emerging fields. Had we measured interactions with the
ordinary GC from time series analysis, one would expect GC to
be stronger when neural activity increased because of increased
SNR. However, we here considered instantaneous interactions.
Electric field effects on neurons travel at the speed of light. Thus,
interactions do not depend on synaptic and conduction delays
that would be measures with ordinary GC. We used a different
measure, “spatial GC,” to describe interactions and calculated GC
strengths based on time snapshots or, in other words, spatial
profiles of neural activity—instead of time series. The finding that
large fluctuations in neural activity correlated with windows of
significant spatial GC interactions suggests that neurons gener-
ated electric fields that fed back to them instantaneously. This
is a form of circular causality. Circular causality is central in the
theory of synergetics discussed below.
We also found that the electric fields were more stable than
neural activity, i.e. had less representational drift. The coefficients
of variation associated with field-to-activity GC strengths were
smaller than the corresponding coefficients based on activity-
to-field interactions. Also, GC strengths of interactions between
FEF and SEF neural activity were sparser over time than the
corresponding strengths based on electric fields. This concurs
with earlier results where electric field estimates were more often
correlated across trials, i.e. more stable, compared with neural
activity estimates (Pinotsis and Miller 2022).
Using RSA (Kriegeskorte et al. 2008; Diedrichsen and Kriegesko-
rte 2017), we also confirmed that electric fields emerging from
FEF and SEF ensembles contained the same information. RSA
assesses matches between memory representations in different
brain areas. Information can be represented at different levels,
e.g. in neural activity or electric fields. We found that FEF and SEF
representations contained similar information only when we used
electric field data for RSA analysis—not LFP or neural activity.
Thus, memory representations seem to be linked at the electric
field level.
Overall, our results suggest that in addition to synaptic trans-
mission, information transfer might be guided in a top-down
fashion by electric fields. In mathematical language, electric fields
are a control parameter. This term appears in the theory of
synergetics from complex systems (Haken 1987; Basar et al. 2012).
Examples of control parameters include energy (Basar et al. 2012;
Haken 2012), and feedback attention signals in a binocular rivalry
task (Ditzinger and Haken 1989). A control parameter has two
features that the electric field has: it is stable and evolves at
a slower time scale than enslaved parts (i.e. neural activity).
This is reminiscent of Wiener’s “virtual governors,” which are
slow and enable homeostasis (Wiener 2019). These regulate self-
organization and allow for mutual entrainment (Dewan 1976). In
“Methods,” using mathematical arguments, we explained how the
electric field can be a control parameter and showed how ephaptic
coupling follows from the slaving principle (Haken 2012; see
also discussion below). We also showed that if ephaptic coupling
occurs in one brain area in a memory network (engram complex)
it will occur in all other brain areas.
Our results offer a plausible explanation of ephaptic coupling
as an application of the more general slaving principle of synerget-
ics. Of course, other explanations of the slow dynamics of emerg-
ing electric fields might exist. For example, synaptic plasticity or
slow waves of synaptic barrages could also play a role. We will
consider this in future work.
The idea that electrical fields play a role in the formation of
neural ensembles has a long history. The connection between
memories, connectivity, and electric fields was noted early. The
term engram complex was coined by German biologist Richard
Semon, who, over a century ago, suggested that memories are
stored in groups of neurons in multiple brain areas (Semon et al.
2018). Then, according to Semon’s law of ecphory, memory recall
happens when an appropriate electric field is generated—an ener-
getic “condition”similar to memory registration is achieved during
recall (Thompson 1976; Josselyn et al. 2015; Semon et al. 2018).
The importance of the electric field has also been emphasized
in recent synaptic plasticity studies. These have revealed that
learning and memory change scaffolding proteins that regulate
synaptic functions, like trafficking and binding of NMDA or other
receptors (Kim and Sheng 2004). In turn, protein changes result in
changes of synaptic activity and of the electric field in the extra-
cellular space. Thus, synaptic activity is not dictated solely by
electrical elements, the receptors, charged particles, and currents,
but also chemical elements, like scaffold proteins. Both electrical
and chemical elements determine the electric field in the extra-
cellular space (Queenan et al. 2017). Receptors occupy synapses
with some probability, and can vary from trial to trial where the
same memory is recalled. This also means that different neurons
form ensembles in different trials where the same memory is
maintained, a phenomenon known as representational drift (Rule
et al. 2019).
It is now known that the brain’s endogenous electric field feeds
back to the activity of individual ion channels and alters their
neuronal firing, i.e. there is ephaptic coupling (Anastassiou et al.
2011); see Anastassiou and Koch (2015) for a review. The pioneer-
ing study by Eccles and Jaeger (1958) showed ephaptic effects
on ion currents in synaptic cleft. McFadden and other authors
have taken the importance of ephaptic coupling one step further:
they have linked it to conscious awareness and hypothesized that
it can be used for computation that occurs momentarily and is
distributed over space (Pockett 2000; John 2005; Fingelkurts et al.
2012; McFadden 2020). These authors suggest that the physical
instantiation of the brain’s electric field leads inevitably to a
representation of information privy to the agent whose neural
activity produces the field. Because this happens at each moment,
it can naturally explain subjective mental experiences like the
first person perspective (Vogeley and Fink 2003), sense of pres-
ence (Fingelkurts et al. 2012), and the quanta of time (Stroud
1956). Fields can integrate distributed information at the speed of
light and might not be mere epiphenomena; instead, they could
complement synaptic transmission and communication, whereas
the brain performs mental transformations and computations
(McFadden 2020).
Direct evidence of ephaptic coupling has been found in slices
(Jefferys et al. 2012; Anastassiou and Koch 2015; Chiang et al.
2019). Testing such hypotheses and in vivo ephaptic effects in
general is more difficult. Electrodes are far from the neural

ensemble and multiple groups of neurons are activated at the
same time. Further, chemical processes like electrodiffusion and
others alter the electric fields (Savtchenko et al. 2017). Here, we
used a variety of computational techniques to provide in vivo
evidence.
The low-dimensional stability of electric fields can help the
brain with memory maintenance and cognitive processing in
general. Synergetics suggests that latent states, like connectivity,
can be reliably transferred between brain areas, in accord with
modern engram theory (Ryan et al. 2015). This is orchestrated
by control parameters. In synergetics, latent states are called
order parameters (Yu et al. 2008; Gallego et al. 2020). The the-
ory posits that order and control parameters exist in all self-
organized dynamical systems (e.g. molecules, fluids) and there-
fore the brain. They emerge because of self-organization and cap-
ture collective dynamics of a large part of the system’s individual
parts. Importantly, parts, order, and control parameters evolve at
different timescales that are separate: control (bioelectric fields,
slowest), order parameters (e.g. effective connectivity, oscillation
frequency, intermediate), and enslaved parts (spiking, fastest).
This separation of timescales follows from the center man-
ifold theorem. Haken (Haken 2006) pointed out this separation
is crucial for consciousness. Order parameters evolve slowly and
this “can be interpreted as a phase transition from subliminal
to conscious phase”. They sent essential information to other
brain areas. This is like Mooney faces that are images known to
induce gamma oscillations associated with conscious experience
(Lachaux et al. 2005). Oscillation frequency is an order parameter
in this case. In Pinotsis et al. (2018), we showed that during a
working memory task, when the cognitive capacity limit was
exceeded, synchrony between oscillatory responses in PFC, FEF,
and LIP broke down and the monkey made errors. That is, order
parameters were different when the monkey could vs. when
he could not remember. More generally, neural ensembles are
thought to maintain memories as a result of coordinated neuronal
activity (Tonegawa et al. 2015b). Control parameters can control
the spiking of such large numbers of neurons. We here suggest
that the electric field is a control parameter. Control parameters
guide order parameters and constrain enslaved parts. Neurons
give rise to the ensemble and an emerging electric field. This, in
turn, determines the function of each neuron through ephaptic
coupling. This is an example of circular causality and an applica-
tion of the slaving principle mentioned above.
This is also a difference between synergetics and dimensional-
ity reduction approaches (Gao and Ganguli 2015; Jazayeri and
Ostojic 2021). Like dimensionality reduction, synergetics uses
latent states. But it also uses control parameters. These evolve
at an even slower timescale than latent states and spiking and
are characteristic for each state of the brain, e.g. each memory.
Synergetics suggests that control parameters are somehow fixed
in the sense that when they change, the brain goes to a different
stable state, similar to phase transitions in thermodynamics
(Domb 2000).
In sum, using biophysical modeling, machine learning, and GC,
we provided some evidence supporting the hypothesis that bio-
electric fields are a control variable that enslaves neural activity.
This can have implications for modern BCI, where electric field
manipulations are used to control neurons so that activity reverts
to a healthy state and patient behavior is abolished.
