Human races are not like dog breeds: 
refuting a racist analogy

Abstract 
In 1956, evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane posed a question to anthropologists: “Are the biological differences 
between human groups comparable with those between groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and 
bulldogs…?” It reads as if it were posted on social media today. The analogy comparing human races to dog breeds 
is not only widespread in history and pop culture, but also sounds like scientific justification for eschewing the social 
construction of race, or for holding racist beliefs about human nature. Here we answer Haldane’s question in an effort 
to improve the public understanding of human biological variation and “race”—two phenomena that are not synony-
mous. Speaking to everyone without expert levels of familiarity with this material, we investigate whether the dog 
breed analogy for human race stands up to biology. It does not. Groups of humans that are culturally labeled as “races” 
differ in population structure, genotype–phenotype relationships, and phenotypic diversity from breeds of dogs in 
unsurprising ways, given how artificial selection has shaped the evolution of dogs, not humans. Our demonstration 
complements the vast body of existing knowledge about how human “races” differ in fundamental sociocultural, 
historical, and political ways from categories of nonhuman animals. By the end of this paper, readers will understand 
how the assumption that human races are the same as dog breeds is a racist strategy for justifying social, political, and 
economic inequality.

Background
Dogs factored greatly into Darwin’s conception of evo-
lution (Townshend 2009) and he specifically pondered 
the similarities of human races and dog breeds in The 
Descent of Man (1871). As an integral and influential 
player in Darwin’s legacy, evolutionary biologist J.B.S. 
Haldane posed a question to a group of anthropologists 
at the Royal Society in 1956 that reads as if it were posted 
on social media today: “Are the biological differences 
between human groups comparable with those between 
groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and 
bulldogs…?”
In the U.S., and likely beyond, the human race-dog 
breed analogy is not merely an academic question about 
patterns of variation; today, it factors substantially into 
the popular debate about whether race is fundamentally 
biological as opposed to a social construct, and it carries 
forward an ugly American tradition. Inherent to the anal-
ogy is the transference of beliefs about pure-bred dogs 
onto notions of human racial “purity” (e.g. Castle 1942; 
Harrington 2009), which helped U.S. legislators pass 
anti-miscegenation laws in the early twentieth century 
(Lombardo 1987). In 2016, Mother Jones demonstrated 
how mainstream and persistent the analogy is when they 
published their interview with a leading white suprema-
cist who equated human races to dog breeds (Harkinson 
2016). The American familiarity with dogs helps make 
their relevance to human “race” seem natural. It sounds 
like science, but as we demonstrate below it is not.
Here we investigate how the biological variation among 
dogs and humans compare and contrast, answering Hal-
dane’s question while rebuking the illegitimate appeal 
to science and the erroneous “logic” of the widespread

analogy. To start, we compare genotypic and phenotypic 
variation within and between human groups and within 
and between dog breeds. After we demonstrate the fun-
damental biological differences between patterns of vari-
ation in the two different species (parts 1, 2, and 3), as 
well as the fundamental distinctions between “race” in 
humans and dog breed categories (part 4), we discuss the 
sociocultural significance of this analogy and the impor-
tance of its refutation (parts 4 and 5). That is, a goal of 
this paper is to reveal why equating the category we cul-
turally call “race” to patterns of human biological varia-
tion is non-sensical and equating “race” to the categories 
we know for dogs is pernicious and racist, despite the 
comparison appearing obvious to many individuals. We 
counter the seemingly innocent belief that because dogs 
are distinguishable, on sight, by breed that therefore 
human racial categories are just as biologically-based. As 
many readers know all too well, the breed-race analogy 
sits in close cultural and mental proximity to the non-
innocent racism that lowers targeted minorities to the 
status of nonhuman animals (see Weaver 2013). Readers 
are urged to consult the vast and rich literature discuss-
ing the cultural-historical-political context of catego-
rizing humans, and the social construction of the race 
concept, including and especially by scientists, some of 
which we cite throughout this paper (e.g. Sussman 2014; 
Marks 2012a, b, 2017; Brace 2005; Koenig et al. 2008; and 
many others). This context is imperative, but that the 
race-breed analogy persists means that there are individ-
uals who are either unfamiliar with that knowledge or are 
unconvinced by it, perhaps willfully so.
Here, for the purposes of demonstrating that the 
race-breed analogy is not supported by science (despite 
it being used by some as scientific-sounding justifica-
tion for race-based social injustices), we must use the 
conceptions of race and breed dictated by the terms of 
the analogy itself. That is, we will consider the biologi-
cal variation within and between groups acknowledged 
by the 2010 U.S. census (United States Census Bureau) 
and the American Kennel Club (AKC), respectively. The 
AKC lists 192 dog breeds. The number of dog breeds 
has varied over time, increasing as institutions recognize 
new breeds among the some four hundred to a thou-
sand breeds described globally. The five racial categories 
used most recently by the United States Census Bureau 
(White, Black or African American, American Indian 
or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander) reflect the current perception of race in 
the U.S. However, the number of human races has var-
ied throughout U.S. history, reflecting the shifting social 
and political motivations, including slavery and immigra-
tion, a fact that highlights the significant ways that race 
concepts are driven by social forces. Presently, racial 
categorizations vary across cultures—for just one exam-
ple, there are at least 18 terms to describe a person’s race 
or skin color in Brazil (Santos et al. 2009).
As noted above and as will be discussed in this paper, 
“race” is far more than ancestral/inherited DNA and is 
far more than geographically patterned morphological 
variation like skin color. But because the analogy between 
races and dog breeds incorrectly privileges biology over 
the social and historical factors that have led to the devel-
opment of racial constructs, here we demonstrate how 
genetic data fails to substantiate the racial categoriza-
tions used in the U.S. today and their equivalence to dog 
breeds.
Population structure of human races and dog 
breeds
A key assumption of the race-breed analogy is that both 
human “races” (i.e. U.S. census groupings) and dog breeds 
are formed and structured in similar ways, with each 
representing distinct groups within each species. If this 
assumption holds, then one expects to observe both high 
levels of among-group diversity and low levels of within-
group diversity. Put another way, this predicts that groups 
(whether races or breeds) are clearly distinguishable from 
each other while at the same time also being internally 
very similar. Physical anthropologists have a long history 
of trying to classify people into groups based on biologi-
cal traits (for example, skin color, cranial measurements, 
blood group antigens, and more recently DNA). Notably, 
such groups often varied depending on the trait studied, 
the populations explored, and the political motivations 
of the scientist doing the classifying (reviewed in Marks 
2012a, b). Today, anthropologists remain interested in 
the patterns of variation in these and myriad other bio-
logical and biocultural traits. However, their motivations 
for doing so are to use such information to reconstruct 
human evolutionary history, and to investigate the bio-
logical and sociocultural processes that shape pheno-
types, rather than to identify biologically discrete human 
groups.
Patterns of among- versus within-group genetic 
diversity can be assessed using various tools and meth-
ods from the field of population genetics. For example, 
both the ­FST statistic and analysis of molecular variance 
(AMOVA) allow one to investigate patterns of among- 
versus within-group genetic diversity. Higher ­FST values 
indicate a more structured population (i.e. possessing 
distinct clusters) while lower values (closer to 0) imply 
less structure (i.e. possessing few or no distinct clusters, 
most likely due to higher rates of random mating among 
individuals). AMOVA allows a researcher to partition the 
total amount of genetic variation in a sample into differ-
ent levels. When a large percentage of the total variation 

Page 3 of 20

in a sample can be explained by among-group differences 
within the sample, this suggests that the sample is highly 
structured, and composed of distinct genetic subpopu-
lations. Alternatively, when variation among individuals 
within groups explains a large portion of variation in the 
total sample of all the groups, it implies a less structured 
population.
In addition, statistical programs such as structure 
(Pritchard et al. 2000) use model-based clustering algo-
rithms to place individuals into a predetermined num-
ber of groups based on multilocus genotype data, and to 
estimate the fraction of genetic ancestry that individuals 
have from each of these groups. Results are displayed 
graphically, with population groups denoted by different 
colors. Individuals with ancestry from multiple groups 
are displayed using multiple colors (see Figs. 1 and 2 for 
examples and further explanation). It is important to note 
that structure will always identify the number of groups 
specified by the user—the program tries to find the best 
way to allocate sampled individuals into k user-defined 
groups in a way that will maximize Hardy–Weinberg 
equilibrium for each group (Bolnick 2008). As such, it is 
important for users to run structure for multiple values of 
k, and evaluate the statistical likelihood of each of these 
models. 
Structure’s results are sensitive to a number of fac-
tors, including linkage between loci, Hardy–Weinberg 
equilibrium, sample sizes of populations, genetic drift, 
and geographic distribution of populations (discussed in 
Lawson et al. 2018; Novembre 2016; Bolnick 2008). Fur-
ther, interpretation of the groups identified by structure 
as real, “pure” groups instead of statistical constructs 
runs counter to how evolution works and also runs the 
risk of reifying old and false biological conceptions of 
race (Weiss 2018; Weiss and Lambert 2010, 2011, 2014; 
Weiss and Long 2009). Specifically, such misinterpreta-
tions imply that at some point in our evolutionary past 
there existed a set number of distinct homogeneous 
Fig. 1  Clustering assignment of 85 dog breeds by Parker et al. (2004): “seventy-four breeds are represented by five unrelated dogs each, and the 
remaining 11 breeds are represented by four unrelated dogs each. Each individual dog is represented on the graph by a vertical line divided into 
colored segments corresponding to different genetic clusters. The length of each colored segment is equal to the estimated proportion of the 
individual’s membership in the cluster of corresponding color (designated on the y axis as a percentage). Breeds are labeled below the figure”

groups, and that modern populations or individuals with 
ancestry from multiple groups are somehow less “pure”. 
It must be emphasized that no current or past popula-
tion is homogenous or pure and no living population is 
any group’s ancestral population. As Weiss and Lambert 
(2010) point out, these approaches can “describe data as 
if they reflect true evolutionary history. As-if fictions can 
be useful as analytic tools if everyone understands they 
are simply convenient statistical digests. But the phrasing 
of papers often suggests [without ‘imputing to them any

values of K = 2 through K = 6. Each cluster (K) is represented by a different color. Each individual is a vertical line, which depicts an estimate of 
that individual’s membership in each cluster (multiple colors indicate membership in more than one cluster). Thin black lines denote individual 
populations. Population labels are shown at the bottom of the figure, while broad regional labels are listed at the top of the figure. While broad 
geographic clustering occurs, note that many individuals share genetic similarities with more than one cluster. This is particularly true within 
continents and for individuals from populations at the borders of continents

social racism’ (p. 97)] that the typological conclusions are 
being taken as if they represent actual history.” (p. 95).
While the data and results from structure can be misin-
terpreted in the ways described above, they can be help-
ful in illustrating if and how genetic variation is shared 
across groups. Now, let’s consider levels and patterns of 
dog and human genetic variation to see how they com-
pare. In 2004, Parker and colleagues analyzed data from 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 120 dogs 
representing 60 breeds as well as 96 microsatellite loci 
genotyped in 414 dogs representing 85 breeds. Both STR 
and SNP data demonstrated low levels of within-breed 
heterozygosity, indicating that within breed genetic vari-
ation was low (H = 0.313–0.610), while ­FST estimates also 
indicated high levels of differentiation among breeds 
­(FST = 0.33). These results were consistent with earlier 
studies looking at smaller numbers of breeds (Koski-
nen 2003; Irion et  al. 2003), and have been supported 
by subsequent studies of dog population structure and 
domestication (vonHoldt et al. 2010). In their AMOVA 
analysis of the 96 genotyped microsatellites, Parker and 
colleagues (Parker et al. 2004) report that ~ 27% of vari-
ation among dogs in their sample could be attributed to 
variation across breeds, with the remainder of the genetic 
variation explained by within-breed variation, implying 
that the breeds in their sample are highly genetically iso-
lated from each other.
Parker et al. (2004) then used the program structure to 
place individual dogs into a predefined number of popu-
lation clusters. Running structure on overlapping subsets 
of 20–22 breeds at a time, they observed that the major-
ity of individual dogs could be placed into distinct clus-
ters that corresponded with their reported breed identity 
(Fig. 1). Using genotype data alone, they correctly identi-
fied the breed of 99% of the dogs included in their sam-
ple. Taken together, the low within-breed heterozygosity, 
high among-breed ­FST, AMOVA, and structure results all 
present a picture of a highly structured population.
Parker et al.’s analysis of dog population structure can 
be compared to an earlier study of human population 
structure using similar methods (Rosenberg et al. 2002). 
In this paper, Rosenberg and colleagues utilized allele 
frequency data from 377 microsatellites genotyped in 
the 52 populations of the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome 
Diversity Panel. Rosenberg et  al. conducted AMOVA 
that examined genetic variance components within and 
among the individual populations of the HGDP-CEPH 
as well as within and among five and seven broad geo-
graphical groupings of these populations. These regional 
groups can be viewed as generally analogous to conti-
nental regions and U.S. census groupings (the seven-
region scheme divides Europe/Middle East/Central Asia 
into three separate categories). The authors observed 
that genetic differences among regions accounted for 
only 3.3–4.7% of global human genetic variation (much 
smaller than the 27% of genetic differences among dog 
breeds reported by Parker et  al. 2004), and that varia-
tion within populations accounts for ~ 92.9–94.3%. Dif-
ferences among populations within regions accounted 
for 2.4–2.6% of the remaining genetic variation. In addi-
tion, within-region levels of heterozygosity (0.664–0.792; 
Rosenberg et  al. 2002) were notably higher than those 
observed for dog breeds (0.313–0.610; Parker et  al. 
2004). This reflects the much greater total genetic vari-
ation within human groups compared to dog breeds. 
These results are comparable to those from other human 
datasets/populations, including HGDP-CEPH multi-
locus SNP data (Li et al. 2008). Furthermore, data from 
The 1000 Genomes Project demonstrates that ­FST values 
between continental groups are far lower (0.052–0.083) 
than ­FST values for dog breeds (The 1000 Genomes Pro-
ject Consortium 2015). In sum, these data suggest that 
a greater degree of global genetic variation in humans 
can be attributable to variation within local popula-
tions, rather than between regional (racial) groups, and 
that substantial heterogeneity can be found within these 
groups. This stands in marked contrast to the lower lev-
els of heterozygosity observed within dog breeds and the 
large amount of genetic variation that can be explained 
by breed differences.
Rosenberg et  al. (2002) also used the program struc-
ture to explore patterns of human genetic variation in the 
HGDP-CEPH dataset (Fig. 2). They found support for a 
model of six genetic clusters, five of which roughly corre-
spond to the broad continental regions of Africa, Europe/
Middle East/Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania, and the 
Americas (the sixth cluster corresponded to the isolated 
Kalash population of northwest Pakistan). While some 
spuriously interpreted the identification of these clusters 
as support for a genetic basis for human racial groups 
(Wade 2014), others identify aspects of these results that 
are inconsistent with such an interpretation. First, Bol-
nick (2008) notes that in addition to finding support for 
the six-cluster model, Rosenberg and colleagues found 
support for models specifying a larger number of clus-
ters, although the groupings of the 52 populations within 
those clusters were often inconsistent, suggesting a low 
confidence in any given clustering of the populations. The 
existence of multiple clustering models of human genetic 
variation contrasts the rigid breed-aligned clusters iden-
tified for dogs by Parker et al. Second, Rosenberg et al. 
found that most individuals had membership in more 
than one cluster, implying that genetic clusters did not 
represent discrete genetic units. This pattern was par-
ticularly noted for humans living near the borders of 
these geographically linked clusters. This supports a 

Page 6 of 20
Norton et al. Evo Edu Outreach           (2019) 12:17 
distribution of genetic variation that is driven by constant 
mating among neighboring populations and relatively 
low levels of genetic differentiation driven almost entirely 
by geographic factors.
In 2003 Bamshad and colleagues genotyped over 500 
people from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Asia, and 
Southern India for 100 Alu insertion polymorphisms 
and 60 microsatellites. Much like Rosenberg et al., these 
authors used the program structure to identify geneti-
cally determined clusters of populations within this sam-
ple. They also attempted to place individuals from Africa, 
Europe, and East Asia into the correct continent of ori-
gin using only genotype data. The authors report being 
able to do so for 99–100% of the samples. In this case, a 
correct assignment meant that an individual was identi-
fied as having the greatest proportion of ancestry in the 
genetic cluster corresponding to their continent of ori-
gin. While this might sound like good support for the 
idea that humans can be assigned to unique and distinct 
genetic clusters that correspond to continental groups, 
the interpretation of these results is complex, as outlined 
by Bolnick (2008). First, structure analysis of the sub-
Saharan African, European, and East Asian samples iden-
tified four clusters: Europeans, East Asians, sub-Saharan 
Africans (excluding Mbuti pygmy populations and three 
other African individuals), and a cluster consisting of 
Mbuti and the remaining three African individuals. How-
ever, most subsequent analyses were conducted assuming 
only three clusters (ignoring potential structure within 
Africa). Second, as noted by Bamshad et  al., the popu-
lations chosen represent relatively small samples from a 
limited number of populations that are widely geographi-
cally dispersed—the inclusion of people from geographi-
cally intermediate regions may have lowered the accuracy 
of cluster assignment. As an illustration of this, when 
South Asian samples were included in the analyses, accu-
racy of cluster assignment for these samples was notably 
lower (87%; Bamshad et al. 2003).
Taken together, these comparisons suggest that these 
continental-based human racial categories differ from 
dog breeds in two ways. First, levels of within-group 
(within-“race” or U.S. census groupings) diversity in 
humans are generally considerably higher than diversity 
observed within dog breeds, while levels of differentia-
tion among such human groups is lower than observed 
among breeds. Second, while it is possible to use algo-
rithms such as the one implemented in structure to 
identify groups of humans that tend to cluster on the 
basis of genetic similarity (in other words, there is some 
structure to human genetic diversity as is expected 
given how humans, like all species, do not mate at ran-
dom, but over the generations have tended to repro-
duce with those who live relatively close to them), those 
clusters tend to be highly porous (individuals may have 
membership in multiple clusters) and determining the 
“correct” number of clusters is subjective, even for 
geneticists. That is, U.S. census groupings are not the 
only way to impose order on patterns of human genetic 
variation.
In the comparisons above, we have used the con-
tinental population clusters identified by Rosenberg 
et al. as a proxy for U.S. racial categories. However, it 
is important to note that racial categories in the U.S. 
are not simple reflections of geography, nor are these 
categories applied using definitions of “race” proposed 
by some geneticists. For example, Dobzhansky [who 
argued against racial essentialism, as described in 
Jackson and Depew (2017)], defines races as “Mende-
lian populations that differ in the frequencies of some 
gene or gene” (Dobzhansky 1955). While this definition 
reflects the strong mathematical roots of population 
genetics (and could be applied in many different ways 
to different groups, nesting it within that larger, arbi-
trary social framework for “race”), the use of the term 
“race” in the U.S. encompasses far more than simple 
differences in allele frequencies.
Racial categories in the U.S. are drawn, in part, on 
the western concept of race first described by Linnaeus, 
which emphasized differences among humans based on 
geographic, physical, cultural, and behavioral factors. 
As described in Marks (2016), these categories were 
heavily influenced by the social, cultural, and political 
factors of that time. These included extended sea travel 
by Europeans (traveling great distances by sea tended 
to emphasize differences in appearance and culture, 
while land travel highlighted more gradual changes), 
as well as the strong motivating sociopolitical and eco-
nomic influences of both colonialism and slavery. From 
the beginning, racism was embedded in race science. 
Within the U.S., racial categories (as recognized by the 
U.S. census) have shifted over time, reflecting concerns 
about slavery, immigration, hypo- and hyper-descent, 
and access to resources (Snipp 2003). Alongside that 
ongoing history, there has been disagreement among 
geneticists about how human genetic variation is pat-
terned, most famously between Lewontin (1972) and 
Edwards (2003). For perspective, Marks (2010) wrote,
“What is unclear is what this [disagreement] 
has to do with ‘race’ as that term has been used 
through much in the twentieth century—the mere 
fact that we can find groups to be different and can 
reliably allot people to them is trivial. Again, the 
point of the [biological] theory of race was to dis-
cover large clusters of people that are principally 
homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, 

Page 7 of 20
Norton et al. Evo Edu Outreach           (2019) 12:17 
contrasting groups. Lewontin’s analysis shows that 
such groups do not exist in the human species, and 
Edwards’ critique does not contradict that inter-
pretation.” (p. 270)
Other genetics researchers have concluded that 
human evolutionary history has produced a “nested 
pattern of genetic structure that is inconsistent with 
the existence of independently evolving biological 
races” (Hunley et  al. 2009). This perspective comple-
ments Livingstone’s famous “there are no races, only 
clines” (1962) statement, which refers to the spectrum 
of continuous human phenotypic variation we see glob-
ally. Two examples of continuous geographic variation 
in the human species include human cranial shape and 
size (Relethford 2009) and skin color, a trait strongly 
influenced by natural selection, showing clinal vari-
ation in epidermal melanin moving north and south 
away from the most intensive UV radiation around the 
Equator (Gibbons 2014; Fig. 3). Clinal variation across 
human-defined boundaries like continents refutes 
clear-cut distinctions between human groups.
If patterns of genetic or biological variation were found 
to be identical between dogs and humans, or between 
any other species and humans, that would still not 
support a biologically-based concept of “race,” with or 
without its foundation for racism. Further consideration 
of these issues and a demonstration of the link between 
the biological concept of race and racism can be found in 
part 4, below. The point here is to show that the scientific 
sounding basis of the breed-race analogy does not hold 
up to science and we continue refuting the analogy next, 
with a comparison of the evolutionary histories of dogs 
and humans, which are the circumstances that created 
the observed variation today.
Origins and evolution of biological variation 
within humans and domestic dogs
While our understanding of Homo sapiens origins is 
increasingly complex, the fossil record indicates that 
all humans alive today trace their ancestry to Africa, 
roughly 200–500 kya and all hominin evolution prior to 
~ 2 mya occurred in that region of the world. Genomic 
studies indicate that all humans descend from ancestors 
living in Africa whose descendants dispersed around 
Africa, Europe, Asia, and Southeast Asia. Subsequent 
interbreeding with late Pleistocene hominins in Europe 
(Neanderthals) and Asia (Denisovans) within the past 
100 kya affected human evolution, uniquely, in those 
regions (Vernot et  al. 2016; Higham et  al. 2014; Reich 
Fig. 3  From “Shedding Light on Skin Color” by Gibbons (2014)

Norton et al. Evo Edu Outreach           (2019) 12:17 
et  al. 2011; Kuhlwilm et  al. 2016). Present human bio-
geographic variation has been shaped by this Pleistocene 
migration and gene flow, plus more than 50,000  years 
of subsequent gene flow, genetic isolation, genetic drift, 
selection, epigenetic change, and coevolution with other 
species, not to mention culture (Simonti et  al. 2016; 
Dannemann and Kelso 2017; Racimo et  al. 2015). As a 
result of the effects of these different evolutionary forces, 
while a number of very rare (and usually very young) 
alleles may be geographically localized, the majority of 
common genetic variants are not private to a particular 
continent, and are often shared across multiple regions 
(The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2015). This is 
because, in contrast with dogs, no modern human popu-
lations have ever been completely reproductively isolated 
over many generations.
Our understanding of Canis lupus familiaris (pure-
bred dogs, mixed breed dogs, and “village” dogs) origins 
is also growing in complexity. All dogs are descended 
from ancient wolves (Vilà et al. 1997), but some research-
ers have advanced a dual origin hypothesis (Frantz et al. 
2016) with centers in southern China by 15 kya (Wang 
et al. 2016) and in Europe between 32 and 18 kya (Thal-
mann et  al. 2013) or 20–40  kya (Botigué et  al. 2017). 
Present biogeographic variation in domestic dogs is the 
result of all the same mechanisms of evolutionary pro-
cesses that affect humans, as well as domestication via 
coevolution, cohabitation, mutualism, and intentional 
breeding or “artificial selection” by humans.
In village dogs specifically, present biogeographic 
variation has been shaped by more than 15,000 years of 
backcrossing and hybridization with wolves, coyotes, 
jackals, and domestic breeds, plus gene flow, genetic 
isolation, genetic drift, selection, and co-evolution with 
humans. Village dogs are more genetically diverse and 
geographically widespread than domestic breeds (Shan-
non et al. 2015). While the so-called “ancient breeds” like 
chow chows and salukis are as old as a few 1000 years, 
most dog breeds are younger than a few 100 years. Some 
breeds (e.g. the Bernese mountain dog) arose by hybrid-
izing breeds while others were bred from existing breeds 
to serve a particular role. At present, no population of vil-
lage dog is genetically isolated, but every breed effectively 
is.
Breeds arise due to breeders’ extreme control of mat-
ing to maximize the presence of desired traits in the 
next generation of dogs. In this process of artificial 
selection, dogs are prevented from mating outside their 
breed and only a limited number of animals are permit-
ted to reproduce within a breed. Some male dogs have 
sired more than 2500 offspring (Leroy 2011). Further, 
intense selection on closed populations of limited size 
(i.e. intense inbreeding) is one of the main reasons why 
dogs have over 1000 inherited diseases and health dis-
orders (Leroy 2011).
The relatively low levels of population substructure 
(i.e. low levels of between-group variation) in humans 
are commonly attributed to our relatively recent origin 
as a species and the high rates of gene flow between 
human populations that have spread both neutral and 
adaptive mutations. It is notable that the origin of 
modern humans (> 200  kya) markedly predates that 
of dog domestication (20–40  kya). When differences 
in generation time between the two species are taken 
into account [~ 20  years for humans = 10,000 genera-
tions over 200,000 years; ~ 4.5 years for wolves (Mech 
et  al. 2016) = ~ 9000 generations over 40,00  years], it 
would seem that there has been just as much or more 
time for substructure to evolve in our own species as 
has evolved in dogs. That it did not suggests that the 
strict artificial selection imposed on dogs by humans 
through selective breeding has had a profound effect on 
within- and among-breed levels of dog genetic diver-
sity. In contrast, while geographic, cultural, or linguis-
tic features may slow or limit gene flow between human 
groups, these forces have not resulted in the high lev-
els of genetic differentiation that resulted from artifi-
cial selection for distinct and distinguishable breeds of 
dogs. In accordance with their release from strict selec-
tive breeding and artificial selection, village dogs show 
significantly more genetic diversity and higher hete-
rozygosity than breed dogs (Boyko et al. 2009).
As we saw in the previous section, the majority of 
genetic variation is shared across human populations. 
However, in cases where human groups have experi-
enced differentiation via localized circumstances of 
natural selection (e.g. pigmentation responses to ultra-
violet radiation, resistance to pathogens, changes to 
diet, adaptation to high altitude) we sometimes see 
convergence on a similar phenotype with independent 
genetic contributors within the same genes (e.g. lactase 
persistence in Africa and Europe) or in different genes 
(e.g. dark pigmentation in groups across Africa and 
Asia). In contrast, for dogs with similar phenotypes, 
it is far more often the case that a single underlying 
mutation is responsible for a shared phenotype. For 
example, the same mutation at FOX13 causes hairless-
ness in three dogs with seemingly distinct origins—the 
Xoloitzcuintli, the Peruvian Hairless, and the Chinese 
crested—but which all inherited the mutation from a 
common ancestor, as evidenced by a large, shared hap-
lotype (Parker et al. 2017). Further differences between 
humans and dogs in the type and distribution of genetic 
influence on phenotypes are explored next.

Genotype–phenotype relationships in comparable 
dog and human traits that vary
Historically, a key component of “scientific” (read: unsci-
entific) human racial classifications included some com-
bination of physical characteristics, like pigmentation, 
and body size and shape. These perceptions linger in pre-
sent-day U.S. cultural conceptions of race, and for many 
may overshadow the social and political factors that have 
heavily influenced these concepts. Exploring the biology 
underlying these physical characteristics helps refute the 
human race dog breed analogy.
If we consider similar phenotypic traits that also vary in 
dogs we find that the genotypes underlying these pheno-
types involve fewer genes than in humans. This phenom-
enon is consistent with the lower total genetic diversity 
within dog breeds compared to U.S. census groupings. 
Relative simplicity in genotype–phenotype relations, also 
referred to as “genes of major effect,” for some dog traits 
(Cadieu et al. 2009) has contributed to the ease by which 
humans have artificially selected seemingly complex 
traits and the rapid production of entirely new breeds 
within just several generations. For the ten major dog fur 
phenotypes (short; wire; wire and curly; long; long and 
furnishings; curly; curly and furnishings; hairless torso 
with long hair on head, feet, and tail; hairless torso with 
short hair on head feet, and tail; and hairless), different 
combinations of two alleles at only five genes sort them 
all, with few known exceptions (Parker et  al. 2017). In 
contrast, the seven genes thus far associated with hair 
curliness in humans can explain only a small fraction 
of the total variation within or between groups (Eriks-
son et al. 2010; Adhikari et al. 2016; Medland et al. 2009; 
Westgate et al. 2017).
The biology of pigmentation may be equally simple 
in dogs, in contrast to what is well-known for humans. 
Studies focusing on variation in human skin color within 
European populations (Beleza et al. 2013; Candille et al. 
2012; Sulem et  al. 2007, 2008; Valverde et  al. 1995) or 
between Europeans and other populations (Norton et al. 
2007; Shriver et  al. 2003; Lamason et  al. 2005; Quil-
len et al. 2012), identified 15 genes which explained up 
to 35% of the variation in pigmentation in these popula-
tions. However, recent studies focusing on non-European 
populations have identified more than 50 additional loci 
that affect skin pigmentation within Africa (Martin et al. 
2017; Crawford et  al. 2017). This reflects the tremen-
dous amount of variation in both skin color and genet-
ics within the African continent and demonstrates that 
skin pigmentation in humans may be governed by hun-
dreds of loci, including many with complex interactions 
and minor, but important, effects on phenotypes (Quillen 
et al. 2019). Additionally, recent work has identified novel 
mutations contributing to lighter skin pigmentation in 
East Asian and Native American populations (Adhi-
kari et al. 2019), further highlighting the diverse genetic 
mechanisms that influence human pigmentation varia-
tion. Due to the shared mechanisms underlying skin and 
hair pigmentation in humans, a subset of genes impli-
cated in skin pigmentation variation also influence hair 
pigmentation (Sulem et  al. 2007; Valverde et  al. 1995; 
Guenther et al. 2014; Kenny et al. 2012; Nan et al. 2009). 
However, the genetic architecture of coat color in dogs 
seems far simpler—currently there are only nine genes 
known to influence dog coat color and pattern (five of 
which are associated with coat color specifically) (Kaelin 
and Barsh 2013).
In terms of stature, human populations vary around the 
world, and height differs within and among the five races 
defined by the 2010 U.S. Census. Data from the Centers 
for Disease Control (Fryar et al. 2016) show differences 
in the average height of individuals by self-identified 
racial category, but a much greater amount of overlap. 
The median white man (of the, on average, tallest racial 
group among U.S. men) is 177.1 cm tall (69.7 in.) while 
the shortest group on average, Asian men, are 170.3 cm 
tall (67.0 in.)—a difference of approximately 3 in., or less 
than 0.2 standard deviations in height among U.S. men. 
The distribution of variation in stature within human 
populations is broad and very different from that seen in 
dog breeds. The height distributions of men in the U.S. 
overlap such that approximately 15% of Asian men are 
taller than the median white man. Both groups overlap 
even more substantially with black men. (It is also worth 
noting that the difference in median height between 
men and women of a single U.S. census group is greater 
than that between men of any two U.S. census group-
ings, and the same is true between women.) Consider the 
tallest (Manute Bol at 231 cm or 91 in.) and the short-
est (Muggsy Bogues at 160 cm or 63 in.) players in the 
history of the NBA. While they represent extremes of the 
human male height distribution, Bol is only 1.44 times 
taller than Bogues.
In contrast, dog breed differences in stature are far 
greater than what is observed across U.S. census divi-
sions of humans. The median shoulder height in Great 
Danes (76 cm, 30 in.) is four times greater than in Peking-
ese (19  cm, 7.5  in.; Stone et  al. 2016). When scaled to 
human height, this would be equivalent to a difference of 
470.7 cm (185.3 in.) or about the difference between an 
average human and a two-story building. Years of breed-
ing to divergent standards combined with low genetic 
diversity has resulted in limited and non-overlapping 
height variation for many breeds (Sutter et al. 2008). Even 
within dogs in the middle third of the height distribution, 
like Italian Greyhounds, their top 5% for height does not 
overlap with the shortest 5% of Golden Retrievers.

Height, like most traits in humans, is extremely com-
plex, meaning it is regulated by a large number of genes 
(the vast majority of which show nearly identical varia-
tion across all human populations) plus environmental 
factors. It takes more than 400 genetic loci to explain 
only half of human height variation (Wood et al. 2014), 
but for dogs, only six major genetic loci explain roughly 
50% the variation in size between breeds (Chase et  al. 
2002; Jones et al. 2008; Rimbault et al. 2013; Sutter et al. 
2007). Considering dogs, one haplotype in IGF1 explains 
47.6% of the variation in height, with a single haplotype 
variant of IGF1 shared across all small dog breeds (of 14 
small and 9 giant surveyed; Sutter et al. 2007).
These differences between humans and dogs in the 
genetic complexity and the diversity of their traits are 
due to the distinct impact of artificial selection on 
dogs. Human genetic variation has been shaped over 
many generations by relatively weak natural selection 
on most traits, including height. For example, natural 
selection on height may occur in certain climate condi-
tions where being taller or shorter may amount to some 
thermoregulatory or metabolic boost to reproductive 
success. However, even in populations where height (or 
skin color or any other such variable trait) is under selec-
tion, the majority of individuals across the phenotypic 
spectrum will still reproduce and pass their genes on to 
the next generation. Furthermore, the accumulation of 
new genetic mutations, random fluctuations in trait and 
genetic variant frequencies due to genetic drift, and the 
introduction of new alleles into populations via gene 
flow all dilute natural selection’s ability to drive large dif-
ferences in phenotypes or genotypes between popula-
tions. As a result, human populations are genetically very 
similar to one another with overlapping phenotypes. In 
contrast, modern purebred dogs exist almost entirely 
due to artificial selection; their mating is controlled by 
humans to produce offspring with desired traits. To do 
this, animals with rare genetic mutations, like those with 
the dwarf variant of IGF1, are bred together for several 
generations, acting against the natural accumulation of 
genetic variation (i.e. evolution by anything other than 
artificial selection) within the breed.
Dog breeds seem to be so distinct from one another 
in many conspicuous traits because, relative to human 
groups, they are. This is true in terms of the extreme 
differences in physical traits seen between dog breeds, 
whereas U.S. census groupings overlap in terms of all 
physical traits, and it is also true with regard to the 
underlying differences in the genetic architecture that 
determines these traits.
There are clear and important biological differences 
between the categories of U.S. census racial groupings 
and dog breeds and how they relate to overall variation 
in their respective species, including population struc-
ture, genotype–phenotype relationships, and phenotypic 
diversity. These contrasts are unsurprising given how 
artificial selection has shaped the evolution of dogs, not 
humans and given how “race” cannot be reduced to pat-
terns of human biological variation, which is discussed 
next.
The sociocultural and political construction of race
Critics will fault this paper for constraining “race” to 
only the five groups acknowledged by the U.S. Census. 
But such criticisms only illustrate the subjective, socio-
cultural construction of the categories humans define 
as race. While definitions and perceptions of racial cat-
egories vary person to person, culture to culture, and 
throughout time, dog breeds are strictly defined in their 
breed standards. For example, here is the Portuguese 
Water Dog (Fig. 4):
“General Appearance: Known for centuries along 
Portugal’s coast, this seafaring breed was prized 
by fishermen for a spirited, yet obedient nature, 
and a robust, medium build that allowed for a full 
day’s work in and out of the water. The Portuguese 
Water Dog is a swimmer and diver of exceptional 
ability and stamina, who aided his master at sea 
by retrieving broken nets, herding schools of fish, 
and carrying messages between boats and to shore. 
He is a loyal companion and alert guard. This 
highly intelligent utilitarian breed is distinguished 
by two coat types, either curly or wavy; an impres-
sive head of considerable breadth and well propor-
tioned mass; a ruggedly built, well-knit body; and 
a powerful, thickly based tail, carried gallantly

or used purposefully as a rudder. The Portuguese 
Water Dog provides an indelible impression of 
strength, spirit, and soundness.”
All AKC breed standards include physical and behav-
ioral traits, and describe an ideal condition. Written by 
“parent clubs,” dog breed standards describe the cham-
pion individual within a given breed. But, within the 
hierarchical framework of the Great Chain of Being, 
the earliest descriptions of human “varieties” empha-
sized not the champion individual but the champion 
race (Brace 2005). For physician and anatomist J. F. 
Blumenbach, Georgians or “Caucasians” represented 
“the closest approximation of God’s intent for human 
form, and other human populations…departed from 
that manifestation of the ideal” (Brace 2005, p. 46). 
Eventually Blumenbach’s favorite race became “white.” 
Recently some leading scientists and scholars published 
a statement titled “Taking Race Out of Human Genet-
ics” that included: “Phasing out racial terminology in 
biological sciences would send an important message 
to scientists and the public alike: historical racial cat-
egories that are treated as natural and infused with 
notions of superiority and inferiority have no place in 
biology” (Yudell et al. 2016). In that piece the authors 
challenge researchers to consider a paradox first noted 
by Dobzhansky (1962): while race can be a tool to elu-
cidate human genetic diversity, it is a blunt implement 
that does a poor job of explaining actual relationships 
between ancestry and genetics. Yudell and colleagues 
charge researchers and scientific societies to think criti-
cally about, and to justify their use of, particular cat-
egories to describe human diversity.
Careful consideration of the terminology used in bio-
medical studies forces both scientists and the public to 
more clearly understand the questions being asked and 
the variables used to do so. For example, in some cases 
using “race” as a variable may be important, especially 
when exploring how social discrimination, structural 
racism, and other socially determined factors may be 
responsible for health disparities. In other cases using 
“race” may simply obscure important variation within 
these socially-defined categories that can have signifi-
cant medical implications (Yudell et al. 2016). The goal 
is not to ignore patterns of human biological or genetic 
diversity, but rather to identify new methods to explore 
these patterns that do not reproduce the harm caused 
when human biological variation is treated as a mere 
synonym for racial categories built on the hierarchical 
organization of people. “Race” is the ranking of bio-
logical variation, and whether one race is superior to 
another is not a scientific or biological issue, which is 
perhaps why claims of racial superiority or inferiority 
are so often countered with denunciation of race as a 
meaningful biological concept and with assertions that 
its significance is social (Smith 2018).
American history provides more context for the social 
construction of “race.” On the contemporaneity of the 
establishment of the AKC and the unveiling of the Statue 
of Liberty, both in the mid 1880s, Harrington (2009) 
writes how, “the embrace of purebred dogs coincided 
with the scorning of immigrants,” and, “at the height of 
nineteenth-century immigration, when Irish, German, 
Italian, Jewish, and other so-called ‘races’ kept arriving, a 
purebred dog was not a mongrel, much as someone born 
in the United States—read a white Anglo-Saxon Protes-
tant—was not an immigrant.” Harrington further writes 
how, “this growing popularity of purebred dogs coin-
cided with a revival of nativism, the movement of ‘pure’ 
Americans of the 1840s and 1850s,” and likens the “Fitter 
Family” eugenics contests of the 1930s to AKC dog shows 
which had become tradition (Harrington 2009). About 
that time, in 1924, the state of Virginia passed the “Racial 
Integrity Act,” also known as a law against miscegenation 
(etymologically referring to the mixing of biologically dis-
tinct taxa), which prohibited marriages between whites 
and nonwhites with few exceptions. The rhetoric that 
swayed the Virginia legislators was steeped in the race-
breed analogy, particularly with the concept of “mongre-
lization.” The arguments in favor of anti-miscegenation 
laws appealed to, and yet also misrepresented, the bio-
logical and genetic sciences for support of what were 
clearly racist political views fearing the disappearance of 
the white race (Lombardo 1987). Likewise, current argu-
ments that appeal to science to push the “reality” of bio-
logically-based human race, or “race realism,” are key to 
white supremacist politics.
In resisting the scientifically historical idea of race 
where separate human groups were ranked hierarchi-
cally, C. Loring Brace famously called race “a four-letter 
word.” This complex sociocultural-historical under-
standing of race (as opposed to significantly biologi-
cally based) is shared across anthropology and beyond 
and is understood to be a driving force of sociocultural, 
health, education, economic, and political inequality 
and inequity. Emphasizing the sociocultural construc-
tion of race in no way diminishes the reality of race as 
a powerful phenomenon. As Torres and Colón (2015) 
write, “human biological diversity does not have to be 
in opposition to constructivist notions of race. Rather, 
racial experience is emphasized as an embodied experi-
ence that is as real and as valid as biological variation.” 
Racism can have damaging consequences on human 
health and well-being (Gravlee 2009; Gravlee et  al. 
2009; Sims et al. 2012; Boulter et al. 2015; Quinlan et al. 
2016). Yudell et al. (2016) wrote that they “acknowledge 

Page 12 of 20
Norton et al. Evo Edu Outreach           (2019) 12:17 
that using race as a political or social category to study 
racism and its biological effects, although fraught 
with challenges, remains necessary. Such research is 
important to understand how structural inequities and 
discrimination produce health disparities in sociocul-
turally defined groups.”
Both Haldane’s question and the pop culture compar-
ison of human races to dog breeds needle at the debate 
occurring outside of anthropology, and largely outside 
of academia, over the biological basis for race. These 
discussions are heavily influenced by the historical con-
ception in science, biology, and anthropology of “race” 
as being synonymous with (or an acceptable term for) 
variation in human biology at the group or population 
level, but that view no longer holds. Within contempo-
rary anthropology there is near consensus that “race” 
is more of a social construct and, thus, a sociocultural 
concept than it is a biological concept. According to 
a survey by Wagner et al. (2017), the majority of pro-
fessional anthropologist respondents (totaling 3286) 
disagreed with the following statements: “The human 
population may be subdivided into biological races” 
(86% disagreed); “Racial categories are determined by 
biology” (88% disagreed); “Genetic differences between 
racial groups explain most behavioral differences 
between individuals of different races” (95% disagreed); 
“Most anthropologists believe that humans may be sub-
divided into biological races” (85% disagreed). Here is 
a glance at the orientation within that anthropological 
majority:
“There is a lot of confusion over what we mean when 
we say race is a ‘construction.’ Much of the prob-
lem involves the fact that in order to rebut scien-
tific racism publicly, we are often obliged to accept 
the dichotomy of ‘nature’ and ‘culture’ that we now 
realize to be an oversimplification. But since that 
dichotomy remains a fixture of popular science, 
and of public discourse, we often have to say, ‘No, 
it’s the opposite; it’s culture’—when we would really 
like to say something rather more nuanced. To a 
first approximation, then, we mean that, unlike a 
naively regarded fact of nature, which is presumably 
there to be observed and transparently understood, 
race is a product of history; and although it is often 
associated with variation in biological form, it is 
inherited according to cultural, not biological, rules. 
And thus, rather than seeing race as a simple prod-
uct of nature, it is better understood as a product 
of “nature/culture,” the ascription of arbitrary cul-
tural meaning to patterns of human diversity, often 
in defiance of the biological patterns themselves.” 
(Marks 2017; p. 28)
“Not being a formal scientific concept, a human race 
is largely not accessible to the scientist. It can only be 
grasped through the humanities: historically, expe-
rientially, politically. […] Race is not difference—
because all human groups differ from each other, as 
do all human beings. Race involves imposing some 
cultural patterns upon human differences.”  (Marks 
2017; p. 106)
“The contribution of anthropology…is to acknowl-
edge the impossibility of studying humans as if we 
were not ourselves human and to reconceptualize 
the project as necessarily a biocultural one, infused 
with cultural values of greater or lesser transpar-
ency, but no less scientific for it. […] The act of artic-
ulating and examining the basic assumptions that 
go into the production of knowledge is often called 
reflexivity and is one of the hallmarks of contempo-
rary anthropology.” (Marks 2012b; p. 96)
“People’s imposition of racial categories on, not to 
mention racist treatment of, each other is a cultur-
ally determined and ultimately somewhat arbitrary 
attempt to make sense of our species’ variation in 
categorical terms. Troubles arise when social predi-
lections lead us to mistake cultural facts for biologi-
cal ones and vice versa.”(Weiss and Fullerton 2005; 
p. 167)
“Race is a sense-making system imposed upon the 
facts of difference. Races are not merely human divi-
sions, they are politically salient human divisions. 
All classifications exist to serve a purpose; the pur-
pose of a racial classification is to naturalize human 
differences—that is, to establish important catego-
ries and make their distinctions appear to be rooted 
in nature, rather than in history or politics.” (Marks 
2010; p. 271)
The Portuguese Water Dog demonstrates how entire 
AKC dog breeds are painted with personalities, like 
“strength, spirit, and soundness,” that individual humans 
do not even necessarily share with their immediate family 
members. Yet, dog breeding standards influence assump-
tions about hard-wired behavior characterizing and dif-
ferentiating human groups. The jump from clustered 
physical variation to the assertion of superior and infe-
rior, biologically-based behavioral variation at the group 
level is the crux of the matter. It is why Haldane’s ques-
tion is so much more than an academic curiosity and 
why the pop culture analogy equating race with breed 
demands refutation.

Arguments in support of the biological basis or “real-
ity” of race are often thinly veiled arguments for a sig-
nificantly genetic basis behind perceived behavioral 
differences between races (Sussman 2014). Though it is 
decades old, the “logic” of this argument or line of think-
ing, particularly when it relies on the dog breed analogy, 
is easily gleaned from social media: If one can tell a Dal-
matian from a Mastiff and one can tell a person of one 
race from another race just by looking at them, and if 
behavior is bred into dogs to a degree that distinguishes 
breeds too, then genetically-based behavior also distin-
guishes human races and, thus, a person’s intelligence or 
criminality (etc.) can be predicted by their ancestry.
From this mistaken perspective, the notion of race as a 
social construct is seen as absurd and so is down-playing 
the biological basis for race, because to do so is to be will-
fully stupid, ignorantly anti-science, or brainwashed by a 
politically correct denial of reality. (Hence, the “race real-
ists” who talk of taking the “red pill,” an allusion to the 
film The Matrix where a person frees himself from liv-
ing a false reality.) Consequences of that false framework 
include support for eugenics (past, present, and future), 
racial segregation of schools, justifying status quo insti-
tutional oppression, white nationalism, white supremacy, 
other forms of racism, and defunding social, environ-
mental, economic, and health programs that counter rac-
ism’s effects.
When present, this “logic” of the race-breed analogy is 
not always boiled down to one sentence, like that above. 
For example, in their influential book “Race: The Reality 
of Human Differences” Sarich and Miele (2004) advance 
the race-breed analogy throughout. First, they establish 
that medical approaches to both human and dog disease 
share similarities; individual dogs and humans can be 
sensitive to different drugs and this is sometimes due to 
inherited genetic variants, which means that the risk var-
ies between dog breeds and between human races. Then, 
they ease into a discussion of an experiment where a sci-
entist noted individual behavioral differences among sev-
eral puppies of different breeds. They quote this scientist 
to have said, “A breed of dog is a construct zoologically 
and genetically equivalent to a race of man.” This leads 
the authors into an enthusiastic discussion of observed 
behavioral differences among human babies of different 
races, which is immediately followed by acceptance of the 
genetic basis for the racial differences in IQ made famous 
by The Bell Curve. These pages are then capped by a defi-
nition of races as “populations, or groups of populations, 
within a species, that are separated geographically from 
other such populations or groups of populations and dis-
tinguishable from them on the basis of heritable features” 
(Sarich and Miele 2004; p. 207) which may sound like a 
neutral, objective, and scientific approach to classifying 
human variation except that their book wielding the race-
breed analogy betrays otherwise.
The false “logic” about ancestry, race, and human 
behavior breaks down when one questions the assump-
tions. First of all, as we have shown, the dog breed-human 
race analogy is not biologically sound—it assumes race as 
a natural biological category of humans, a priori. Second 
and inextricably related, the analogy denies sociocultural 
context, both past and present. What is more, it includes 
unquestioned and largely unfounded assumptions about 
genetically-determined and predictable human behavior.
Scientists are still discovering whether and how dog 
behaviors are breed-specific and, when they are, how 
heritable they are. To be clear, a trait’s heritability is an 
estimation of how much of its variation in a population 
is determined by genetic variation in that population; 
heritability is not synonymous with its determination or 
predictability in an individual based on that individual’s 
DNA. There is much known but also much more to learn 
about what else influences behavioral variation among 
dogs like weaning age, diet, and other conditions during 
development. A recent meta-analysis of the heritability of 
dog behavior concluded that not only are breed standards 
poorly aligned with the actual behaviors of the breeds 
they aim to define, but they describe behaviors with lit-
tle genetic component in the first place (Hradecka et al. 
2015). While dog behavior does develop out of inherited 
(as well as environmental) influences, “breed standards 
are largely unsubstantiated, for most breeds that have 
been studied” (Mehrkam and Wynne 2014). These meta 
studies emphasize that variable behavior within breeds is 
often overlooked. They also highlight how difficult it is to 
operationalize behaviors like aggression and intelligence 
and how difficult it is to measure and compare intelli-
gence in dogs; some dogs solve problems thanks to their 
relatively heightened senses of smell, while for others it 
is thanks to their higher energy that keeps them active 
long enough to solve the problem by chance (Mehrkam 
and Wynne 2014). Right now, blanket, authoritative and 
popular claims like “it is obvious that breed differences 
in behavior are both real and important in magnitude,” 
(Scott and Fuller 1965) supports more stereotyping than 
the existing evidence deserves.
In the zeitgeist, scientific enthusiasm for genetics has 
encouraged genetic essentialism, which is the tendency 
to consider genetic outcomes to be immutable and deter-
mined, to prioritize the influence of genes on complex 
outcomes, to view groups with shared genetic heritage as 
homogeneous and discrete, and to view genetic outcomes 
as the most natural and even to be the most morally 
acceptable (Dar-Nimrod and Heine 2011). This view is 
encouraged by the frequent confusion of the deceptively 
complicated scientific concept of “heritable” traits and 

Page 14 of 20

their mistaken translation into being “genetically deter-
mined” rather than being polygenic, context depend-
ent, environmentally influenced, and unpredictable in 
individuals due to their probabilistic nature. Genetic 
essentialism, where genes are synonymous with essence, 
is fertile ground for beliefs that meaningful, distinctive 
individual behaviors have a predictive individual biologi-
cal basis even in the absence of any identified genes. Vari-
ation in human behavior has its roots in both complex 
genetic and non-genetic factors. Claims that such factors, 
or their interactions, map neatly onto geographically and 
socially constructed human groups and can be used to 
predict behavioral traits associated with such groups, or 
of an individual member of a group, are not scientifically 
supported. As Sussman (2014) said about the one behav-
ioral trait that is usually the focus of these discussions, 
“The idea of a unitary purely genetically based intelli-
gence and of biologically distinct races among humans is 
as outdated scientifically as the ideas that the earth is flat 
or that it was created in 4004 B.C.” (p. 305)
Finally, Darwin’s scenario for the evolution of human 
intelligence in Descent of Man (1871) pitted human 
groups against one another, with natural selection ratch-
eting up intelligence in the dominant groups through 
time. Hierarchical ranking of human races is also inher-
ently competitive, which is just one reason why outdated 
and overly simplistic conceptions of evolutionary biology 
have historically paired with racism, and still do. Within 
this racist  framework, hindsight paints the dominant 
group as the more genetically intelligent and naturally 
selected one, justifying its dominance with perceived bio-
logical superiority. While it is true that natural selection 
occurs differently in different lineages and populations, 
it is no longer dogma (> 150  years since Darwin) that 
natural selection causes divergence due to competition 
between populations. In many cases, perpetual mutation 
and drift are enough to explain evolutionary divergence 
(Hedges et al. 2015).
In a contemporary discussion among philosophers 
about the biological (also termed “scientific”) basis for 
“race,” there are claims that clustered human variation 
demonstrates the reality of a biological concept of race, 
and that, further, this supposed reality neither encour-
ages nor partners with racism (Hardimon 2012; Kaplan 
and Winther 2014). These are carefully worded discus-
sions—based on past and present mainstream evolution-
ary biology—with one major exception: by insisting that 
“race” applies to patterns of observable human biologi-
cal variation, these discussions ignore the sociocultural 
meaning of race, its historical context, and its political 
consequences like social and economic inequality. They 
suppose that “race” is eligible for human taxonomy, but 
mainstream American culture shows otherwise. “Race” 
has evolved into a concept that supersedes biology and 
therefore it cannot also apply as a strictly biological con-
cept. After a racist history of science and a racist his-
tory of knowledge production generally, we know that 
“race” does not exist without racism. As McLean (2019) 
has described it, there are “co-constructive relationships 
between historically contingent political processes and 
the biology of humans.” “Race” is, in its essence, about 
human bias and always has been. If, hypothetically, race 
was ever to succeed as a wholly objective and neutral 
biological concept for humans, it lost its chance because 
so much racist science led us to this socially constructed 
state of “race” today. About that racist science Zack 
(2010) writes, “There is a self-revised scientific history of 
ideas of race, but that is not the same thing as a scien-
tific foundation. The need for such a foundation or some 
intellectual justification for the enslavement of Africans 
and the oppression and exploitation of indigenous peo-
ples during the period of European colonization and its 
subsequent racisms—without question motivated belief 
in human races [as real and important, biologically dif-
ferentiated types of humans].” (p. 880)
Biology education, “race,” and racism
People, scientists and nonscientists alike, are suscepti-
ble to the same biased thinking and assumptions as they 
make sense of human biological variation and human 
social, economic, and political inequality and the inter-
sections of those phenomena. Over 30 years ago, biology 
educator, Vance (1987) described this problem and how 
educators were complicit. He argued that scientists and 
science educators are racist if they are not actively facing 
the racism that appeals to science. He wrote, “Education 
in biology has a major role to play in establishing a frame-
work where enquiry can challenge racist images and 
practices—not least because these may be based on ideas 
which appear to have scientific justification, and perme-
ate biology texts.” He also wrote that, “There is need for a 
biology curriculum more appropriate to the needs of the 
pupils, the more politically aware of whom may well feel 
that learning the classical biology curriculum is tanta-
mount to colluding with racism.” And, further, “the con-
tent of the curriculum has never been politically neutral. 
Through engaging in anti-racist education, biology teach-
ers begin to realize that their role in society has always 
been a political one” (Vance 1987).
Science educator Brian Donovan (2017) is attempt-
ing to engage exactly as Vance suggests with junior high 
school biology students. Based on theory and experi-
mental research, he built two models of the causal rela-
tionship between genetic beliefs about group difference, 
essentialism, and prejudice that align with the “logic” 
we described, above, that folks glean from pop culture. 

Page 15 of 20
Norton et al. Evo Edu Outreach           (2019) 12:17 
Donovan’s models are illustrated in Fig.  5 and they are 
the hypotheses he tests with his educational research.
By editing some human biology content for junior 
high school students to include racial terminology or to 
exclude it entirely, Donovan (2017) has found that stu-
dents learning in what he calls the “racial condition” like 
that commonly found in textbooks perceived propor-
tionately more biological differences between races and 
were more essentialist in their thinking after experienc-
ing that curriculum. He also found that they were less 
interested in socializing across racial lines and were more 
opposed to policies aimed at reducing racial inequalities 
in education. He found that “students in the racial con-
dition inferred from their curriculum that if races differ 
in genetic disease prevalence or skeletal structure, then 
they probably also differ cognitively and behaviorally 
because of genetics.” As a result Donovan concluded 
that “repeated exposure to racial terminology in the biol-
ogy curriculum could be considered a risk factor for the 
development of belief in [a] genetic [basis for] racial ine-
quality.” Like Yudell et al., it’s not surprising that Dono-
van reacts to ideations that perhaps we should remove 
racial terms altogether from biology: “The problem is 
not that racial terminology is in the biology curriculum, 
the problem is that the biology curriculum does not 
teach students that it is incorrect to infer that races dif-
fer behaviorally for genetic reasons on the basis that they 
differ medically for genetic reasons. […] the biology cur-
riculum could teach students that racial inequality is not 
the inevitable product of genes. But, if it does, it should 
also teach students that inequality can be sustained when 
people are led to believe that racial difference is genetic.”
We take Donovan’s words here as a directive when 
he wrote, “If repeated exposure to racial terminology in 
biology causes increases in bio-behavioral essentialism 
and prejudice because it leads students to perceive too 
much variation between races, then perhaps teaching 
students about the low amount of variation that actually 
exists across races will decrease racial bias.” With some 
colleagues, Donovan went on to test that hypothesis, 
and found that teaching students about genetic varia-
tion between U.S. census groupings significantly reduced 
their prejudice (Donovan et al. 2019). In this light, it is 
encouraging to see professional organizations, such

as the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 
and the American Association of Physical (Biological) 
Anthropologists (AAP/BA), affirming their commitment 
to improve public genetic literacy in an effort to address 
misconceptions about genetics, ancestry, and “race”, 
particularly how such knowledge is misused by white 
supremacist agendas (ASHG 2018; AAPA 2019).
The existence of the erroneous human race-dog breed 
analogy suggests that there may be unintended negative 
consequences of using artificial selection as a model for 
teaching natural selection. Since artificial selection can 
produce relatively discrete between group variation and 
low heterozygosity in a short period of time, perhaps 
models of artificial selection as teaching tools are inap-
propriate for middle or high school biology education. 
For example, these models could skew students’ percep-
tions of what real biological variation would look like if 
produced by other evolutionary processes (genetic drift, 
migration, dispersal, isolation by distance, selection, non-
random mating, etc.). Perhaps the answer is not to take 
artificial selection out of curricula (because dogs, cats 
and other familiar organisms make for engaging peda-
gogy), but to explicitly and rigorously juxtapose it against 
the rest of evolution. For example, hands-on activities 
that explore the different ways that evolutionary forces 
such as selection, gene flow, and drift (e.g. Lee et al. 2017) 
can affect population variation can be used as a produc-
tive starting point to contrast the effects of natural and 
artificial selection.
Concluding remarks
This paper bridges academic literature and popular cul-
ture. In reaction to notions of race as a “social construct,” 
non-experts may feel justified in holding the oppos-
ing belief that race is just biology. Not an insignificant 
proportion of Americans refuse mainstream academic 
knowledge; our paper offers a way forward for those 
caught up in that culture regarding race. This paper is 
not primarily for the fanatics who are unlikely to change 
their views, but instead it is for onlookers who might be 
so unfamiliar with these issues that they are either sus-
ceptible to unscientific and/or racist thinking or they are 
under-equipped to refute it. The dog breed-human race 
analogy is destructive; if folks see how it does not stand 
up to biology, then maybe they will better understand the 
complexity and significance of race. Several decades ago, 
well before most of the research we cited here was pos-
sible, Montagu (1942) covered familiar territory:
“Man has bred dogs for certain temperamental 
qualities useful in the hunt for many centuries. The 
Irish setter, for example, is always red-haired, but 
his red hair has no connection with his temperamen-
tal qualities. The Irish setter has the same kind of 
temperament as the English setter, but the hair color 
of the English setter is white and black. The only dif-
ference between the white, the black, the white and 
black, and the red setters is in their coat color; there 
are no significant differences in their mental or tem-
peramental qualities. No one ever asks whether there 
are mental and temperamental differences between 
white, black, or brown horses—such a question 
would seem rather silly. When, however, it comes to 
man, the prejudice of anyone who has ever made the 
statement that skin color is associated with mental 
capacity is accepted as gospel. For such an assump-
tion there is about as much justification as there 
would be for the assumption that there exist sub-
stantial differences between different color varieties 
of setters. We know this to be false concerning setters 
only because we have paid more unprejudiced atten-
tion to the mental qualities of dogs than we have to 
those of human beings.” (1942; p. 92–3)
Though we have no way of predicting whether what 
we have presented here will make an improvement [“as 
if all we had to do (refute racists) would be to teach them 
some population genetics” (Marks 2010; p. 272)], we felt 
compelled to try. Scholars and critics may assert that 
because science has a history of encouraging racialism, 
scientific racism, and racist appeals to science, then sci-
ence should step aside in this endeavor. But we believe 
that racist appeals to science deserve scientific rebukes, 
at least as one kind of strategy among many.
While we have attempted here to address one very 
specific belief about human variation, it is embedded in 
widespread, biased assumptions about dogs and within 
a dauntingly complex history of science and its socio-
cultural consequences. Anthropologists, evolutionary 
biologists, geneticists, scientists, scholars, academics, 
teachers, writers, journalists, parents, and citizens must 
move the popular conception of human evolution and 
human variation past the days of Blumenbach and Dar-
win. To do so means to question not just what we think 
we know about ourselves but what we think we know 
about everything around us too. Being so familiar and so 
widely adored, dogs have significant potential to untether 
racism from evolutionary biology, for good. Toward 
that end, we showed that the categories we impose on 
humans and dogs are different in important ways, and 
that the comparison lends no science to racism. Equat-
ing the differences between two human beings to the ide-
alized differences between a greyhound and a bulldog is 
the province of poetry or prejudice, not science.

Glossary
AMOVA—analysis of molecular variance is a method to 
investigate population structure using molecular data. 
While ­FST relies on allele frequencies, AMOVA also 
incorporates information about the genetic distance 
between haplotypes (Excoffier et al. 1992)
FST—a measure of genetic differentiation among sub-
populations based on allele frequencies. ­FST is a meas-
ure of the reduction of heterozygosity in a subpopulation 
relative to heterozygosity in the total population. ­FST 
values of 0 indicate that individuals in a population are 
mating at random (there is no substructure), while an ­FST 
value of 1 indicates complete substructure (subpopula-
tions are completely differentiated on the basis of allele 
frequencies)
Genotype—the combination of alleles inherited from 
each parent at a particular genetic locus
Haplotype—a set of DNA variants inherited together as 
a single unit
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium—a statistical test to 
determine if a genetic variant in a specific population is 
currently undergoing strong evolutionary forces such 
as selection or genetic drift. To be “in” Hardy–Wein-
berg equilibrium means that the allele frequencies of are 
remaining the same from generation to generation and 
evolution is not occurring at that locus
Heritability and Heritable traits—Heritability is a sta-
tistic used to estimate the amount of variation in a phe-
notypic trait that can be attributed to genetic variation 
between individuals in a population. Heritability explains 
the proportion of variation in a trait that cannot be 
explained by environmental or random factors. A com-
mon misconception about heritability statistics is that 
they can be used to explain the proportion of an individ-
ual’s phenotype that is determined by genetics. In other 
words, if the heritability of a trait (say height) is 0.40, this 
does not mean that 40% of an individual’s height is deter-
mined by genetics and 60% by environment. Instead, this 
means that 40% of the variation in height within a par-
ticular population can be explained by genetic factors
Heterozygosity—the state of possessing two non-iden-
tical copies of an allele, inherited from each parent
Homozygosity—the state of possessing two identical 
copies of an allele, inherited from each parent
kya—thousands of years
Linkage—co-segregation (co-inheritance) of two or 
more alleles either due to physical location on the chro-
mosome or the distribution of allele frequencies in the 
population
Locus (plural loci)—a physical location on the chromo-
some which usually represents the position of a gene or 
portion of a gene
Microsatellite—often referred to as short tandem 
repeats (STRs), these are small pieces of DNA that 
mutate rapidly and are useful to measure differences 
within and between groups
Mutualism—a symbiotic relationship that benefits both 
parties
mya—millions of years
Phenotype—the observed, physical properties of an 
organism, brought about by a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors
Population structure—occurs when a larger population 
contains multiple sub-populations, with varying degrees 
of gene flow occurring between them
Racialism—“the empirically false scientific idea that the 
human species can be naturally partitioned into a reason-
ably small number of reasonably distinct groups” (Marks 
2017; p. 50)
Racism—“the morally corrupt political idea that natu-
ral human groups are differently endowed, are rankable 
and differently entitled on such a basis, and that conse-
quently individual people ought to be judged on the basis 
of their membership in such groups, rather than on the 
basis of their own properties, abilities, achievements, or 
rights” (Marks 2017; p. 50)
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)—genetic varia-
tion at a single base (i.e. A, C, G, or T) in the genome
Standard deviation—a way to quantify the amount of 
variation or dispersion of a dataset
Structure—a computer program that employs a 
model-based clustering algorithm to infer population 
structure using multi-locus genotype data. Briefly, for a 
user-defined value of k (number of clusters) structure will 
find the most likely way to divide individuals in k clusters 
based on their genotypes. Structure is also able to iden-
tify “admixed” individuals who have membership in more 
than one cluster (Pritchard et al. 2000)
