transition in VO2 based on 
experimental and theoretical 
investigations of magnetic features

The metal-insulator transition temperature Tc in VO2 is experimentally shown to be almost the same as 
a magnetic transition temperature Tm characterized by an abrupt decrease in susceptibility, suggesting 
the evidence of the same underlying origin for both transitions. The measurement of susceptibility 
shows that it weakly increases on cooling for temperature range of T > Tm, sharply decreases near Tm 
and then unusually increases on further cooling. A theoretical approach for such unusual observations 
in susceptibility near Tm or below is performed by modeling electrons from each two adjacent V4+ ions 
distributed along V-chains as a two-electron system, which indicates that the spin exchange between 
electrons could cause a level splitting into a singlet (S = 0) level of lower energy and a triplet (S = 1) 
level of higher energy. The observed abrupt decrease in susceptibility near Tm is explained to be due 
to that the sample enters the singlet state in which two electrons from adjacent V4+ ions are paired 
into dimers in spin antiparallel. By considering paramagnetic contribution of unpaired electrons 
created by the thermal activation from singlet to triplet levels, an expression for susceptibility is 
proposed to quantitatively explain the unusual temperature-dependent susceptibility observed at low 
temperatures. Based on the approach to magnetic features, the observed metal-insulator transition is 
explained to be due to a transition from high-temperature Pauli paramagnetic metallic state of V4+ions 
to low-temperature dimerized state of strong electronic localization.
Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is generally shown to undergo a metal-to-insulator (M-I) transition at a tempera-
ture Tc ~ 340 K1,2, which is accompanied by a simultaneous structural distortion from a high-temperature (T) 
rutile-type tetragonal (R) phase to a low-T monoclinic (M) phase2–5. This structural distortion as an important 
focus in M-I transition has also been verified by recent studies6–8. Since its discovery more than forty years ago, 
this transition has been attracting considerable interest for fundamental reasons9–16, and for possible applica-
tions7,17–23. Although various approaches have been proposed2,9–16,24, a complete and generally accepted picture 
of the transition has not yet been developed. It is generally believed that the transition to the insulating state is 
due to the formation of dimers, each being formed by two electrons from adjacent V4+ ions distributed along 
V-chain direction in spin antiparallel. However, a basic question is still unclear, that is-, whether does the forma-
tion of dimers cause a structural distortion to the M phase or does the structural distortion lead to the formation 
of dimers? This question is studied in the present work by investigations of magnetic features in VO2 based on 
measurements for the temperature dependence of susceptibility and a theoretical approach to electronic state 
by modeling electrons from each two adjacent V4+ ions distributed along V-chain direction as a two-electron 
system. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that the VO2 undergoes a magnetic transition characterized by an 
abrupt decrease in susceptibility near the M-I transition temperature, and shows Pauli and unusual paramagnetic 
(PM) behaviors above and below the transition temperature, respectively. Despite structural, electronic, mag-
netic properties and even multi degrees of freedom coupling involved have been proposed, a generally consen-
sus on unusual behaviors of VO2 has not been developed so far25–27. The observed different magnetic behaviors

are discussed by considering whether the spin exchange exists between electrons from adjacent V4+ ions along 
V-chain direction or not.
Results
A bulk VO2 polycrystalline sample is used in the present experimental investigation, which was prepared by 
hydrothermal method. Stoichiometric quantities of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5, 99.9%) and oxalic acid (99.5%) 
with a substance ratio of 1:1.5 were mixed and dissolved in pure water. The mixed liquid was put into high pres-
sure proportion and heated at 180 °C for 48 h. The reacted intermediate VO2 (B) powders were annealed at 550 °C 
for 2 h in vacuum, then pressed into pellets and sintered at 900 °C for 4 h in vacuum to get the final product VO2 
(M) bulks. Shown in Fig. 1 is a refinement of X-ray diffraction pattern measured at room temperature by using 
Fullprof 2.0. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to a M phase of β = 122.6° with P21/c space group, and no 
secondary phase can be detected. The lattice parameters are calculated to be a = 0.575048 nm, b = 0.452436 nm 
and c = 0.538120 nm, respectively.
The zero-field resistivity (ρ) and susceptibility χ
( ) for an applied magnetic field of 1000 Oe as functions of T are 
measured in a commercial physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). Because the sam-
ple resistance at low temperatures is over range of PPMS, the ρ −T dependence was measured only for the 
temperature range of T > 250 K. In Fig. 2 we display ρ T
( ) and χ T
( ) data measured during cooling process, and 
corresponding differential curves. A sharp increase in ρ can be found in the ρ −T curve, which is generally 
explained to be a result of M-I transition. From the differential curve, we determine the M-I transition tempera-
ture Tc to be ~334 K at which

transitions. Therefore, understanding the magnetic feature involving in VO2 is helpful to find a clue to reveal the 
nature of M-I transition. It should be mentioned that the susceptibility as a function of temperature was also

The VO2 is of paramagnetism for the whole range of temperature covering from high-T metallic to low-T 
insulating states, which can be confirmed through the measurement of hysteresis loop in which no magnetic 
hysteresis becomes visible at various fixed temperatures from 370 K to 10 K28. Nevertheless, the experimental 
fact of magnetic transition displayed in Fig. 2 proposes that the PM behavior at T > Tm should be different from 
that at T < Tm. In Fig. 3 we display the χ vs. T curve measured in the field of 1000 Oe during cooling process for 
a wide range of temperature from 390 K to 10 K. It can be seen that the susceptibility increases weakly on cooling 
for the range of T > Tm,onset, passing through the transition region, it no longer decreases but unusually increases 
on cooling from a temperature denoted by Tm,offset ~ 330 K.
Discussion
In order to explain observed different PM behaviors, here we perform a theoretical approach to electronic states 
in VO2. As well known, a striking feature in crystalline structure of VO2 illustrated in Fig. 4(a) is the existence of 
parallel chains consisting of V4+ ions. In the high-T R phase, the periodical distribution of V4+ ions forms parallel 
straight chains along the cR axis, while in the low-T M phase, the V4+ ions distribute periodically in zigzags along 
the cM axis29, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). As a general case, we can view each chain as a chain consisting of ion pairs 
periodically distributed along the chain direction, where each ion pair contains two V4+ ions. Note that each V4+

As shown in appendix, if no spin exchange exists between electrons, the two-electron system is of four-fold 
degenerate with a same energy E0, while once the spin exchange appears between electrons, the energy level of 
four-fold degenerate would become splitting into a singlet (S = 0) level and a triplet (S = 1) levels. The theoretical

for triplet states. Since the spin exchange term in Eq. (1) is the scalar product of two vector spin operators, it 
should favor parallel spins if J is positive and antiparallel if J is negative. For the present system, the antiparallel 
(S = 0) spin alignment of two electrons is more favorable than the parallel (S = 1), meaning that J should be neg-
ative. The present approach therefore indicates that the spin exchange between electrons can cause a splitting of 
the four-fold degenerate level into a singlet (S = 0) state of lower energy and triplet (S = 1) states of higher energy

tration of change of electronic states with temperature as discussed below.
Based on the above theoretical approach, we can discuss on magnetic features and present interpretations of 
experimental observations in VO2. In the high-T R phase, electrons from two adjacent V4+ ions are separated in a 
larger distance so that the spin exchange between electrons can be neglected. In this case, electrons should show 
behavior similar to near-free electrons. This should be the reason why the VO2 shows metallic behavior at T > 
Tc,onset. Because of the near-free behavior of electrons, the magnetic behavior should be described to the Pauli PM 
theory similar to that seen commonly in simple metals. According to Pauli PM theory31, the temperature depend-
ence of susceptibility can be expressed in the form

 (meV). It 
can be seen that the Pauli PM theory yields an excellent agreement with susceptibility data measured at T > 
Tm,onset. The experimental facts of Pauli paramagnetism at T > Tm,onset and same values in both Tc,onset and Tm,onset 
provide strong support to high-T phase above Tm,onset as a near-free electron system.
On cooling to Tm,onset or below, the spin exchange appears between electrons from two adjacent V4+ ions. 
According to the above approach, this exchange causes the level splitting into the singlet and triplet levels. From 
the viewpoint of energy, the singlet level is more favorable for the occupation of electrons. Therefore, if two elec-
trons from adjacent V4+ ions along the chain direction stay on the singlet level, the two electrons must be paired 
in spin antiparallel. It means that the singlet state is a state in which the dimers are formed by pairing V4+ ions in 
spin antiparallel. We, therefore, propose the spin exchange between electrons to be the reason for the formation of

dimers in spin antiparallel. On the other hand, associated with the formation of dimers, the straight chain consist-
ing of “free” V4+ ions would be distorted into a zigzag chain. It implies that the spin exchange between electrons is 
the reason causing a structural distortion from high-T R phase characterized by straight chains consisting of V4+ 
ions to low-T M phase characterized by zigzag chains consisting of dimers.
Owing to that each dimer contains two electrons, associated with the formation of dimers, the number of 
“free” electrons would change from N at T >

Nd should be zero at T > Tm,onset, but increases substantially on cooling from Tm,onset. On the other hand, each 
dimer has zero spin and cannot contribute to susceptibility. Therefore, the Pauli PM susceptibility would change 
approximately from Na at T > Tm,onset to

 at T < Tm,onset. Because of the substantial increase in Nd on 
cooling from Tm,onset, the susceptibility would show an abrupt decrease as seen in experiments. It means that the 
observed magnetic transition is due to a transition from Pauli PM state of “free” V4+ ions at T > Tm,onset to a singlet 
state at T < Tm,onset in which V4+ ions along the chain direction are paired into dimers in spin antiparallel, a result 
predicted by the above approach. One can also notice that the abrupt decrease in χ only maintains to a tempera-
ture denoted by Tm,offset ~ 330 K, meaning that the formation of dimers occurs mainly in a narrow range of 
Tm,offset < T < Tm,onset and the number of dimers tends to be a T-independent constant Nd0 on further cooling from 
Tm,offset.
The above approach can be further confirmed by analyzing the χ vs. T dependence observed below Tm,offset. As 
indicated in Fig. 3, the susceptibility is no longer decreased but unusually increased on cooling from Tm,offset. The 
observed unusual increase in χ cannot be explained by Pauli PM theory which predicts an almost T-independent 
susceptibility at low temperatures. Although Curie’s law predicts a variation of χ inversely with T, the question 
is what kind of PM entities with magnetic moments responsible for the observed low-T paramagnetism. Below 
Tm,offset the dimers are formed by spin pairing of adjacent V4+ ions in antiparallel, so that each dimer has no mag-
netic moment. Therefore, the dimers cannot contribute to the observed low-T paramagnetism, unless that each 
dimer is phenomenologically assumed to be formed by spin pairing of two V4+ ions at a T-dependent angle28.
Here, we demonstrate that the observed variation of χ inversely with T can be explained by considering the 
contribution to Curie PM susceptibility from unpaired electrons created due to the thermal activation from sin-
glet to triplet levels. According to the above approach, the spin exchange causes the level splitting into the singlet 
and triplet levels. At finite temperatures, it is likely that electrons in the singlet level could be thermally excited to 
the level of the triplet states, resulting in the appearance of unpaired electrons with number ∝

 to be ~85%. It means that in the low-T M phase ~85% V4+ ions are paired into dimers, while the remain-
der ~15% V4+ ions as “free” ions are still resided in the system.
Once the above magnetic features are accepted, it is reasonable to explain the electronic transport behavior 
observed in VO2. In the high-T R phase, because of no spin exchange existing between electrons, electrons would 
be of near-free behavior and hence the system shows metallic behavior. On cooling to Tm,onset or below, the spin 
exchange between electrons from two adjacent V4+ ions leads to the formation of V-V dimers, where each two 
adjacent V4+ ions become one V-V dimer by pairing in spin antiparallel. Because of the antiparallel pairing, elec-
trons would be strongly localized, leading to low-T insulating behavior. The observed M-I transition is therefore 
explained to be due to a transition from high-T Pauli PM state of V4+ ions to low-T dimerized state. On the other 
hand, because both the M-I and magnetic transitions are all related to the formation of V-V dimers, this is the 
reason why the system undergoes simultaneous M-I and magnetic transitions at almost the same temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that the metal-insulator transition in VO2 in origin is closely related to the magnetic 
transition characterized by an abrupt decrease in susceptibility. Based on experimental investigations of suscepti-
bility and the theoretical approach by modeling electrons from two adjacent V4+ ions distributed along V-chains 
as a two-electron system, it is concluded that there is a feature temperature Tm to distinguish between high-T and

low-T phases. At temperatures slightly higher than Tm, no spin exchange exists between electrons from adjacent 
V4+ ions, as a result, the system shows metallic and Pauli PM behavior. Near Tm, because of the spin exchange, 
the system enters into the singlet state in which electrons from adjacent V4+ ions along the chain direction are 
paired into dimers in spin antiparallel, resulting in a transition to insulating state and an abrupt decrease in χ. At 
temperatures slightly lower than Tm, the contribution to PM behavior from some unpaired electrons created by 
the thermal activation from singlet to triplet levels lead to unusual temperature-dependent susceptibility at low 
temperatures. These main conclusions are summarized in Fig. 6.
