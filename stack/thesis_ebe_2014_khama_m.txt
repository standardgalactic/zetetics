Abstract 
Bubble column reactors are widely used in the chemicals industry including 
pharmaceuticals, waste water treatment, flotation etc. The reason for their wide 
application can be attributed to the excellent rates of heat and mass transfer that are 
achieved between the dispersed and continuous phases in such reactors. Although 
these types of contactors possess the properties that make them attractive for many 
applications, there still remain significant challenges pertaining to their design, scale-
up and optimization. These challenges are due to the hydrodynamics being complex 
to simulate.  In most cases the current models fail to capture the dynamic features of 
a multiphase flow. In addition, since most of the developed models are empirical, 
and thus beyond the operating conditions in which they were developed, their 
accuracy can no longer be retained. As a result there is a necessity to develop 
generic models which can predict hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer over a 
wide range of operating conditions. 
With regard to simulating these systems, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has 
been used in various studies to predict mass and heat transfer characteristics, 
velocity gradients etc (Martín et al., 2009; Guha et al., 2008; Olmos et al., 2001; 
Sanyal et al., 1999; Sokolichin et al., 1997).The efficient means for solving CFD are 
needed to allow for investigation of more complex systems. In addition, most models 
report constant bubble particle size which is a limitation as this can only be 
applicable in the homogenous flow regime where there is no complex interaction 
between the continuous and dispersed phase (Krishna et al., 2000; Sokolichin & 
Eigenberger., 1994). The efficient means for solving CFD intimated above is 
addressed in the current study by using Bubble Cell Model (BCM). BCM is an 
algebraic model that predicts velocity, concentration and thermal gradients in the 
vicinity of a single bubble and is a computationally efficient approach 
The objective of this study is to integrate the BCM into the Population Balance Model 
(PBM) framework and thus predict overall mass transfer rate, overall intrinsic heat 
transfer coefficient, bubble size distribution and overall gas hold-up. The 
experimental determination of heat transfer coefficient is normally a difficult task, and 
in the current study the mass transfer results were used to predict heat transfer 
coefficient by applying the analogy that exists between heat and mass transfer. In 

ii 
 
applying the analogy, the need to determine the heat transfer coefficient 
experimentally or numerically was obviated. The findings indicate that at the BCM Re 
numbers (Max Re= 270), there is less bubble-bubble and eddy-bubble interactions 
and thus there is no difference between the inlet and final size distributions. However 
upon increasing Re number to higher values, there is a pronounced difference 
between the inlet and final size distributions and therefore it is important to extend 
BCM to higher Re numbers.  
The integration of BCM into the PBM framework was validated against experimental 
correlations reported in the literature. In the model validation, the predicted 
parameters showed a close agreement to the correlations with overall gas hold-up 
having an error of ±0.6 %, interfacial area ±3.36 % and heat transfer coefficient 
±15.4 %. A speed test was also performed to evaluate whether the current model is 
quicker as compared to other models. Using MATLAB 2011, it took 15.82 seconds 
for the current model to predict the parameters of interest by integration of BCM into 
the PBM framework. When using the same grid points in CFD to get the converged 
numerical solutions for the prediction of mass transfer coefficient, the computational 
time was found to be 1.46 minutes. It is now possible to predict the intrinsic mass 
transfer coefficient using this method and the added advantage is that it allows for 
the decoupling of mass transfer mechanisms, thus allowing for more detailed 
designs. The decoupling of mass transfer mechanisms in this context refers to the 
separate determination of the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient and interfacial area.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background to investigation 
A bubble column is a vessel through which a gas is introduced at the base through a 
sparger as illustrated in Figure 1. The gas bubbles make up the dispersed phase, 
while the liquid constitutes a continuous phase which could be flowing or stagnant.  
The bubbles rise at varying velocities depending on their size and the proximity of 
other bubbles which may influence the motion of the entire bubble population. The 
bubble rise velocity is an important parameter in characterising the bubble column 
hydrodynamics.  
Bubble columns are extensively used in a wide range of industrial applications such 
as flotation, petrochemical, biochemical and chemical. The reasons for their wide 
application are the high rates of heat and mass transfer, ease of operation, low 
maintenance costs and the absence of moving parts. The mode of operation in 
bubble column reactors can be either continuous or semi-batch. In the continuous 
mode of operation, both the gas and the liquid flow concurrently upward in the 
column. On the other hand, for the semi-batch mode of operation, the liquid is 
stagnant and the gas is introduced at bottom of the column in the form of bubbles. In 
the current work, the latter mode of operation was considered when modelling the 
hydrodynamics in the column. 
Although the internal structure of the column is simple, the hydrodynamics are 
complex. For the improved design and scale-up, an understanding of multiphase 
fluid dynamics and its influences in the flow field is essential. The hydrodynamic 
variables that influence the operation, performance, design and scale up are gas 
hold-up, Sauter mean diameter, and interfacial area and bubble size distribution. In 
view of the importance of the accurate prediction of the aforementioned 
hydrodynamic variables, the present work is aimed at developing a reliable predictor 
for these variables.

1.2 Predicting hydrodynamic properties 
The bubble rise velocity is an important parameter in characterising the bubble 
column hydrodynamics. It is normally calculated from force balances over each 
particle using Newton’s second law of motion as reported by Delnoij et al. (1997). 
The forces that are considered to be acting on a spherical, non-deformable bubble 
are drag, and lift, virtual or added mass, pressure and gravity. The force balance 
allows for bubble acceleration, which in turn allows for the determination of bubble 
velocity. The bubble rise velocity affects the hydrodynamics, in the sense that at low 
velocities, break up and coalescence are negligible due to less bubble-bubble 
interactions or eddy-bubble collision. At the low velocities, the bubble residence time 
also increases and thus high gas hold-up is expected. 
However, at high bubble velocities, break up and coalescence begin to take place as 
there are more frequent interactions between bubbles and the continuous phase, 
and between the bubbles themselves. In this case, the bubble residence time is 
small and big bubbles are expected due to the interaction that takes place. It is 
expected that gas hold-up will decrease due to decreased residence time. 

3 
 
The accurate prediction of gas hold-up is of paramount importance due to its 
significant impact on the performance of bubble columns. The prediction of mean 
diameter and gas hold-up allows for the prediction of gas the liquid interfacial area, 
and as a result allows for the calculation of heat and mass transfer rates between the 
phases (Jamialahmadi & Müuller-Steinhagen, 1993). The gas-liquid interfacial area 
can be calculated from mean diameter and gas hold-up as shown in Equation (1.1). 
The bubble mean diameter can be calculated from the predicted size distribution 
using number density probability distribution and bubble size as illustrated in 
Equation (1.2). The spatial variation in the column leads to pressure variation which 
in turn results in liquid recirculation. The rate of mixing, the heat and mass transfer 
rates are all dictated by liquid recirculation in the column (Wu, Cheng Ong & Al-
Dahhan, 2001). There are various techniques used for the determination of local gas 
hold-up in bubble columns, namely: computed tomography, particle image 
velocimetry, optical fibre probes and gamma-ray attenuation.

(1.2) 
In the characterization of hydrodynamics in bubble columns, Bouaifi et al. (2001) 
stated that the separation of mass transfer coefficient and interfacial area is of 
paramount importance. The separation is crucial as the volumetric mass transfer 
coefficient (in its lumped form), does not allow for decoupling mass transfer 
mechanisms. It was explained that the Independent determination of the intrinsic 
mass transfer coefficient and interfacial area, into the intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient and specific interfacial area allows for an investigation to determine which 
parameter controls mass transfer. According to the research of Bouaifi et al. (2001), 
in the determination of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, two columns were 
used for the experiments. Their findings indicated that in one of the columns, the 
volumetric mass transfer coefficient was found to be dependent on interfacial area 
only. In the other column it was found that, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient 

4 
 
was not dependent on interfacial area, as three different spargers which resulted in 
different interfacial areas were used, but the volumetric mass transfer coefficient 
found in each case was the same. It was concluded that the liquid mass transfer 
coefficient is dependent on operating conditions such as gas velocity and sparger 
type. The findings justified the need to independently determine the two parameters 
(intrinsic mass transfer coefficient and specific interfacial area) for a better 
understanding of mass transfer mechanisms, and the current work aimed at 
separating the two parameters for a better analysis. 
The liquid phase properties have an impact on the formation of bubbles in the bubble 
column and thus they affect the gas hold-up (Kantarci, Borak & Ulgen, 2005). To 
investigate this phenomenon, the liquid phase viscosity was changed and its impact 
on the predicted hydrodynamics parameters was determined. It is reported in the 
literature that upon increasing liquid viscosity, larger bubbles are formed and thus 
low gas hold-up and high rise velocities are attained. The effect of operating 
conditions like pressure and temperature on the predicted hydrodynamics have also 
been reported in the literature (Kantarci, Borak & Ulgen, 2005), but the current study 
did not investigate their influence on the hydrodynamics.  
Bubble size is also an important parameter in the characterization of bubble column 
hydrodynamics. It affects gas hold-up, interfacial area and bubble rise velocity. The 
development of a model that predicts bubble size as a function of position and time 
in the column, can aid in the prediction of these parameters that are dependent on it. 
The Population Balance Model is therefore used in the prediction of bubble size 
distribution and its impact in the flow field is determined from Computational Fluid 
Dynamics. 
Kantarci et al. (2005) stated that for high conversion levels, larger reactor heights 
and diameters are desired due to large gas throughputs. They also stated that the 
use of longer and larger diameter columns do not allow for an ease of operation, and 
as a result an optimization process is required. It is therefore necessary to devise 
some optimization tools for the design of a column that is easy to operate by 
reducing the diameter and length of the column while still maintaining the best 
results. For this to be achieved, the hydrodynamic variables that influence the 

5 
 
performance of the column have to be accurately predicted, and the optimum 
operating conditions can be determined thereof. 
1.3 Modelling bubble column hydrodynamics 
Over the past years Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used for 
simulation of bubble column reactors. CFD is a tool that solves Navier Stokes 
equations that describe fluid flow numerically. Simulation by CFD is based on Euler-
Euler, 
Euler-Lagrange 
and 
Direct 
Numerical 
simulation 
(DNS). 
All 
the 
aforementioned simulation techniques are computationally expensive and require 
high performance computing hardware. In most simulations, the constant particle 
size assumption is used (Krishna et al., 2000; Sokolichin & Eigenberger., 1994), 
which is a limitation as this could only be applicable in homogenous flow regime 
where there is no complex interaction between the continuous and dispersed phase. 
In the cases where flow regime changes and there is complex interaction between 
the two phases, CFD has to be coupled with the Population Balance Model for a 
better understanding of different flow regimes and bubble characteristics in bubble 
columns design, scale up and optimization. 
Euler-LaGrange treats the liquid phase in the Eulerian representation and the 
dispersed phase in the Lagrangian representation by tracking each individual fluid 
element in the reactor. In the Euler-Euler approach both the liquid and dispersed 
phase are treated in the Eulerian representation (Kantarci, Borak & Ulgen, 2005). 
Since Euler-Lagrange tracks each individual fluid element of the dispersed phase, it 
requires high computational memory and speed. In terms of computational expense, 
it is more expensive than Euler-Euler approach. 
Coetzee et al. (2011) developed a novel approach which aims at reducing 
computational expense by predicting the flow patterns around single bubbles with an 
algebraic flow model dependant on Reynolds number. The model is named Bubble 
Cell Model (BCM). In its current development BCM predicts velocity vector fields in 
the vicinity of single bubbles and can be extended to predicting thermal and 
concentration gradients. Since BCM is a computationally efficient approach, in the 
current study, BCM was integrated into the Population Balance framework to predict 
concentration gradients and total mass transfer rate in the reactor. Upon the 
determination of mass transfer coefficient, the analogy between heat and mass 

6 
 
transfer was used to predict heat transfer coefficient, thus a need to develop a model 
specifically for predicting heat transfer coefficient was obviated. The Population 
Balance Model was validated with mass and heat integration against the empirical 
correlations. 
The Population Balance is the mathematical framework used in particulate systems 
to predict property distribution of discrete entities such as gas bubbles and oil 
droplets. It has been used in a wide range of topics, which includes dispersed 
phases such as solid-liquid dispersion, liquid-liquid, gas-liquid, and gas-solid 
dispersions (Guha et al., 2008;  Olmos et al., 2001;  Sanyal et al., 1999;  Sokolichin 
et al., 1997;  Sokolichin & Eigenberger, 1999). The general form of the Population 
Balance equation is an integro-differential equation in time, space and internal 
coordinates (mass, volume and bubble diameter) (Ramkrishna,  2000). The 
Population Balance models predict particle size distribution by discretising the size 
range, and therefore resulting in a system of differential equations that describe the 
rate of accumulation or loss of particle number or mass in each of the size classes. 
A Population Balance may include the birth and death terms due to coalescence and 
break-up. The robust models are needed for coalescence and break-up in order to 
have a good understanding of their impact in size distribution. Due to the complexity 
in the behaviour of coalescence and break-up phenomena, there are no analytical 
solutions and thus a numerical solution is needed. The bubble size changes due to a 
number of phenomena including coalescence, breakup and mass transfer into the 
liquid phase.  A Population Balance Equation is shown in Equation (1.3) with the 
aforementioned phenomena represented in specific terms.

The terms on the left side of the equation represent convective transport; the first 
term on the right represents gas expansion due to mass transfer and density 
changes. The second and third terms represent break up of bubbles of a larger 
volume and break-up of bubbles of volume v. The fourth and fifth terms represent the 
coalescence of small bubbles and bubbles of volume v with all other sizes 
(Sporleder, Dorao & Jakobsen, 2011) 
 
Most studies in the literature couple the Population Balance Model with Euler-Euler 
for simulation of bubble column reactors. In the current study, the Population 
Balance Model was used to calculate the bubble size evolution and its impact in the 
flow field was computed from its coupling with BCM. The system under study is an 
air-water at bubbly flow and the liquid phase was assumed to be clean without 
surfactants as they affect bubble break up and coalescence (Lehr, Millies & Mewes, 
2002). 
1.4 Summary 
Although bubble columns have simple internal structure, their modelling can be 
complicated by their complex flow structure. The flow structure is complicated by 
back-mixing, circulation of bubbles, complex interactions between the phases, and 
the bubble shapes which change with the change in flow regime. One example is the 
flow structure near the wall region. At this region, the flow is complicated as some of 
the bubbles circulate with the liquid as the flow is directed downwards. As a result 
the bubble residence time is not directly related to the bubble rise velocity. It is 
therefore difficult to develop models that capture the dynamic features of the 
multiphase flow and the physics is also not well understood. The behaviour of gas-
liquid contactors is highly inhomogeneous and this is due to the previously 
mentioned phenomena. As a result, for modelling these types of reactors, a model 
must comprise a Population Balance Equation to predict the distribution of the 
dispersed phase and a multi-fluid model to model the flow field. Such a model is 
complex and requires significant computational time.

2. Literature review 
2.1. Prediction of hydrodynamics in bubble columns 
The design, scale up and optimization of bubble columns depend on the accurate 
prediction of the hydrodynamic parameters. The predicted variables are gas hold-up, 
interfacial area, Sauter mean diameter, and heat and mass transfer coefficients. 
Over the past decades there has been a considerable research in both modelling 
and experiments for the determination of the aforementioned variables. Despite the 
significant effort employed, there still remains a challenge to develop models that are 
generic in their predictive capability, as most of the work involves empirical 
correlations which are limited in their usage (Michele & Hempel, 2002; Pohorecki et 
al., 2001). The limitation is brought about by the fact that the correlations used 
depend more on equipment type, equipment geometry and operating conditions, and 
thus beyond the conditions under which they were developed, accuracy is no longer 
achieved. 
The literature review presented below considers the state of research in the 
modelling of bubble columns, and identifies areas requiring further investigation. 
2.1.1. Mass transfer coefficient 
Mass transfer refers to the relative motion of species from one phase, stream or 
component to another due to concentration gradients. In gas-liquid contactors, mass 
transfer from the dispersed to the continuous phase is the primary goal of the 
process. The mass transfer rate in these systems depends on bubble size 
distribution, turbulent energy dissipation, bubble slip velocity, bubble coalescence 
and breakup (Wang, 2010). The CFD-PBM coupled models become attractive tools 
in modelling hydrodynamics in bubble columns as they quantitatively account for the 
mentioned parameters that affect the mass transfer rate .For gas-liquid systems, the 
resistance to mass transfer from one phase to another is often in the liquid phase. In 
Bubble columns; the mass transfer rate is the limiting stage of the processes that 
take place. The mass transfer rate in gas-liquid systems is calculated from mass 

9 
 
transfer coefficient, which is the ratio of the mass transferred to the driving force 
(Azzopardi et al., 2011). For this reason the mass transfer coefficient and the specific 
interfacial area are normally the distinctive design parameters (Bhole, Joshi & 
Ramkrishna, 2008). The total mass transferred from one phase to another can be 
taken to be directly proportional to the concentration gradient and gas-liquid 
interfacial area. The proportionality constant is taken to be the intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient (kL). The total mass transfer rate is calculated as shown in Equation (2.1). 
          
          (2.1) 
Over the decades there has been a considerable amount of work done on mass 
transfer in bubble columns (Bouaifi et al., 2001;  Chaumat et al., 2005;  Colombet et 
al., 2011;  Ferreira et al., 2012;  Haut & Cartage, 2005;  Kantarci, Borak & Ulgen, 
2005;  Kerdouss et al., 2008;  Krishna & van Baten, 2003;  Lau, Lee & Chen, 2012;  
Lemoine et al., 2008;  Miller,  1983;  Moo-Young & Kawase, 1987;  Muroyama et al., 
2013;  Wang & Wang, 2007;  Yeoh & Tu, 2004). 
Krishna & van Baten, (2003) developed a CFD model that characterises the 
hydrodynamics and mass transfer for an air-water bubble column operating in 
heterogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes. In their work, for a heterogeneous 
flow regime, the bubbles were classified into two bubble classes, small and large 
bubbles. The findings show that for a homogeneous flow regime, the mass transfer 
coefficient decreases with the column diameter and that is attributed to an increase 
in liquid circulation which increases the velocity of bubbles. As such, a reduced gas-
liquid contact time is realised. The results for mass transfer in a heterogeneous flow 
regime showed that it is important to incorporate the effect of bubble break-up and 
coalescence through Population Balance Modelling.  
 Martín et al., (2009) developed a theoretical model to study the effect of bubble 
deformation on the mass transfer rate for an air-water system. In their work, the 
Population Balance Model was coupled with a theoretical model for Sherwood 
number from which the mass transfer coefficient was predicted. Their findings 
indicate that in bubble columns, the concentration profiles in the vicinity of individual 
bubbles are not entirely developed. This is attributed to the proximity of other 

10 
 
bubbles where the concentration of the dissolved gas in the liquid from the individual 
bubble, is not only dependent on the total mass transfer from that respective bubble, 
but depends also on the mass transfer from other bubbles. As a result it was found 
that the mass transfer coefficient in a case of a bubble swarm is smaller compared to 
mass transfer coefficient for a single bubble. 
Ferreira et al., (2012) used image analysis technique combined with discriminant 
factorial analysis for characterisation of hydrodynamics and mass transfer in a 
bubble column. Their method allowed for an online and automatic characterisation of 
individual bubbles and as a result an accurate prediction of bubble size and specific 
interfacial area over a wide range of operating conditions was achieved. The 
influence of operating conditions such as liquid phase properties (viscosity and 
surface tension), temperature, and type of sparger on the liquid side mass transfer 
coefficient were investigated.  The findings in their study indicate that the influence of 
viscosity on interfacial area and liquid side mass transfer coefficient is considerable. 
Temperature was found to have a pronounced influence on mass transfer coefficient 
while its influence on specific interfacial area was found to not be significant 
2.1.2. Interfacial area 
Gas-liquid interfacial area is the area available for mass transfer from one phase to 
the other phase. To enhance the rate of heat and mass transfer, the interfacial area 
should be large and that is achieved when for the given mass of gas, the bubbles are 
small in size.  The interfacial area is calculated from the area of the bubbles and their 
number densities. The averaging is done as seen in Equation (2.2). 
   ∫       
 
       
   
          (2.2) 
Where N is the total number of bubbles, d is bubble diameter, f is the bubble number 
density probability distribution, and V is volume of the column. 
For the accurate prediction of the gas–liquid interfacial area, it is apparent that the 
bubble Population Balance Equation (PBE) is accurately solved. This can be 
attributed to the fact that the gas-liquid interfacial area is calculated from bubble size 
and the bubble size distribution is predicted by the PBE. The interfacial area 

11 
 
changes to a great degree with the variation in the number density distribution due to 
coalescence and breakup. Since the Population Balance Equation estimates bubble 
size distribution locally, interfacial area can also be estimated locally throughout the 
column (Bannari et al., 2008). 
 
2.1.3. Mean bubble diameter 
Bubble size is an important hydrodynamic variable that needs to be accurately 
predicted as it affects bubble rise velocity, gas hold-up, interfacial area and ultimately 
the rates of heat and mass transfer. The mean bubble diameter is calculated from 
the bubble number density probability distribution and bubble size. The number 
density probability distribution and bubble size are found from the bubble Population 
Balance Equation. It is vital to accurately model the Population Balance Equation as 
the accurate prediction of mean diameter depends on how accurate the Population 
Balance Equation is modelled. According to Chen et al., (2004), the bubble mean 
diameter is calculated as presented in Equation (2.3). 
 
   ∑      
       
          (2.3) 
2.1.4. Bubble size distribution 
The size of bubbles in the column differs from the initial bubble size of bubbles that 
just left the sparger. This difference is attributed to breakup and coalescence that 
take place in the column, and the size of the bubbles is mainly dependent on the 
balance that is achieved between coalescence and break-up rates (Atika & Yoshida, 
1973). In the characterisation of hydrodynamics in bubble column, bubble size 
distribution is one of the important characteristics. Bubble size distribution is 
dependent on the operating conditions, sparger type, column geometry and physio-
chemical properties of both the continuous and dispersed phase (Bannari et al., 
2008). In order to enhance mass transfer between the two phases, small bubbles 
and narrow bubble size distribution over the equipment cross-section are desired. 
This can be ascribed to the fact that smaller bubbles render a larger interfacial area, 
hence high mass transfer rates. Spatially, the bubble size distribution is not constant 

12 
 
in the column due to bubble-bubble interaction and eddy-bubble interaction, and it is 
therefore vital to compartmentalise the column and predict size distribution at each 
column compartment. In doing so, it can be investigated and confirmed as to 
whether bubble size distribution varies along the column. In the present work, the 
column was compartmentalised to investigate the aforementioned phenomenon and 
also to predict the other hydrodynamic parameters at each compartment. 
The importance of bubble size distribution also extends to prediction of flow regime 
transition. Wang et al. (2005) developed a theoretical model for the prediction of flow 
regime transition based on size distribution. In addition, bubble size distribution 
regulates bubble rise velocity, bubble residence time, gas hold-up, the interfacial 
area, and hence gas-liquid mass transfer rate (Shimizu et al., 2000). 
2.1.5. Gas hold-up 
Gas hold-up is defined as the volume fraction of the gas in the gas-liquid dispersion. 
It is an important parameter in the optimization, design and scale-up of bubble 
column (Moo-Young & Kawase, 1987). It is asserted that it indirectly governs the 
liquid phase flow, and ultimately the rates of mixing, heat and mass transfer (Wu, 
Cheng Ong & Al-Dahhan, 2001). There has been extensive work both theoretically 
and experimentally for determination of gas hold-up. In the current work, gas hold-up 
was predicted from mean diameter and interfacial area both of which are predicted 
from the Population Balance Equation. The gas hold-up is calculated as shown in 
Equation (2.4) 
        
 
 
          (2.4) 
Alternatively, gas hold-up can be calculated from total number of bubbles and 
number density probability distribution as illustrated in Equation (2.5). 
         
   
    
 
    
∫           
          (2.5) 

13 
 
2.1.6. Bubble rise velocity 
Bubble rise velocity is one of the most important parameters that govern the 
performance of a bubble column reactor.  The aforementioned hydrodynamic 
variables such as gas hold-up and interfacial are influenced by bubble rise velocity; 
because bubble rise velocity dictates how much time a bubble spends in the column.  
At higher rise velocities, which are experienced in the case of large bubbles, the gas 
hold-up becomes small due to reduced residence time. The interaction of bubbles 
amongst themselves is also influenced by the rate at which they rise in the column. 
At low rise velocities, there is less bubble-bubble interaction and it is expected that 
the bubble size distribution will be narrow. The macroscopic force balance is used to 
calculate the velocity of each bubble and the expression for the force balance is 
illustrated in section (4.1.1) 
The interaction between the continuous and the dispersed phase affects the 
abovementioned interphase forces. To capture the correct physics of the column 
performance, the modelling of the interphase forces has to be done correctly.  
2.1.7. Heat transfer coefficient 
In multiphase reactors, the chemical reaction is accompanied by heat transfer. Heat 
is either released or absorbed depending on whether the reaction is exothermic or 
endothermic. Many studies have been conducted on the prediction of heat transfer 
coefficients. Kumar et al. (1992) reported that local heat transfer coefficient 
increases with an increase in bubble size because larger bubbles create strong 
vortices and an intense mixing in the wake region. 
 
Chen et al. (1994) reported that in bubble columns there are three flow regimes 
encountered as a result of increasing superficial gas velocity. The flow regimes are 
shown in Figure 2 . According to these researchers, at low superficial gas velocities, 
the heat transfer coefficient is relatively small due to the presence of the smaller 
bubbles in the bubbly flow regime. A different trend is observed in the transition and 
churn turbulent flow regimes. When superficial gas velocity is increased, the heat 
transfer coefficient increases due to the increase in bubble size, number and their 
frequent passage in the transition and turbulent flow regimes.

regime; (b), Transition flow regime; (c), Churn turbulent flow regime 
There has been extensive work on the prediction of heat transfer coefficient but most 
studies focused on time-averaged heat transfer of the object to wall and wall to bed 
(Kantarci et al., 2005). However, it has been reported that time-averaged heat 
transfer does not give more information on the instantaneous effect of bubble 
dynamics on heat transfer (Chen et al., 2004). This results in the need to study 
instantaneous heat transfer in bubble column reactors under a wide range of 
operating conditions for a better understanding of heat transfer mechanisms and 
reliable modelling for improvement of design and operation. Heat transfer is affected 
by superficial gas velocity, particle density, particle size liquid viscosity, heat capacity 
and thermal conductivity. These parameters can all be summarised in the Reynolds 
number and Prandtl number. 
Dhotre & Joshi., (2004) developed a CFD model of heat transfer from wall to bed. 
This was done by solving the momentum equations for gas and liquid phases, the 
turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent energy dissipation rate to get the complete 
flow pattern in terms of the distribution of liquid and gas velocities, gas hold up and 
eddy diffusivities. The resulting flow information was then used for the prediction of 
heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer model developed was for the case where 
the bubble was rising in the column and the reactor being heated. 
Wu et al. (2007) performed experiments in a 0.16 m diameter and 2.50 m high 
stainless steel bubble column to investigate the effect of pressure and superficial gas 

15 
 
velocity on heat transfer coefficient. The liquid phase was tap water and gas phase 
was air. The flow rate of air was adjusted by a pressure regulator and a rotameter 
with the superficial gas velocity varied from 0.03 to 0.30 m/s. Bulk temperature of the 
media in the column was measured by a thermocouple probe. The heat transfer 
probe is shown in Figure 3. It was found that heat transfer coefficient increases with 
superficial gas velocity and the increase becomes smaller at higher values of 
superficial velocity. With pressure, it was found to decrease with increasing pressure

shell;3,heat flux sensor;4,heater;5,Teflon cap(Wu, Cheng Ong & Al-Dahhan., 2001) 
. 
Abdulmohsin et al. (2011) conducted experiments on investigating heat transfer 
coefficients and their radial profiles in a pilot plant bubble column using the high 
response heat transfer probe for an air-water system. Their findings indicate that 
heat transfer coefficients were higher for a 0.44 mm column diameter as compared 
to 0.16 mm diameter. However, more work needs to be done to ensure whether the 
differences in the heat coefficients are due to column diameter or other conditions. 
The heat transfer coefficient can also be determined from mass transfer results using 
the analogy between heat and mass transfer. 
2.1.8. Heat and mass transfer analogy 
There exists an analogy between mass, heat and momentum transfer due to the 
similarity that arises from their mathematical description. In addition, there is a 
similarity in the solutions of species temperature, concentration and velocity profiles 
found from solving the three transport equations. The analogy between heat and 
mass transfer is applicable when the following conditions are met (Wilk, 2010, 
Venkatesan & Fogler, 2004). 
 Analogous mathematical boundary conditions. 

16 
 
 Equal eddy diffusivities. 
 Same velocity profiles. 
On the contrary, under the following conditions the analogy does not hold: 
 Chemical reaction 
 Viscous heating 
 A source of heat generation 
 Pressure or thermal diffusion 
The similarities in the mathematical descriptions between heat and mass transport 
equation are represented in Table 1. The mathematical expressions shown give a 
clear indication that the non-dimensional numbers are analogous in each case. The 
semblance can be demonstrated in the general solutions for the two transport 
phenomena. In the case of mass transfer for forced convection, the general solution 
is given by the correlation in Equation (2.6). 
            
          (2.6) 
Analogously, the general solution for heat transfer is given by the correlation 
represented by Equation (2.7) (Wilk, 2010).

The experimental measurements of heat transfer coefficient are complex and 
difficult, and in view of such a difficult task in obtaining heat transfer coefficient 
experimentally, heat and mass transfer analogy offers an alternative and attractive 
tool to predicting heat transfer from mass transfer results. In light of the functional 
dependence between Sherwood, Schmidt and Reynolds number that is found 
experimentally to correlate mass transfer, the same notion is used for expressing an 
analogous relationship between Reynolds, Prandtl and Nusselt number in the 
prediction of heat transfer coefficient (Wilk, 2010). 
The most suited form to predict heat transfer coefficient from mass transfer 
coefficient is expressed in Equation (2.7). There is however some conditions under 
which the relationship expressed in Equation (2.7) cannot hold. One of conditions 
under which the relationship can be employed is that the temperature and 
concentration fields are to be independent, that is to say, when the temperature 
gradient is not directly responsible for the establishment of the concentration 
gradient. Upon the determination of Nusselt number from the heat and mass 
transfer, the heat transfer coefficient is calculated from Nusselt number as shown in 
Equation (2.8). 
The heat and mass transfer analogy was used and heat transfer coefficient was 
calculated from mass transfer results. The results determined from the analogy were 
compared with the heat transfer coefficient results found from adding energy balance 
to the existing CFD model as illustrated in Figure 18. From the results in Figure 18 it 
is evident that the analogy can be used as the comparison between the results from 
the two cases shows a good agreement with a small error magnitude.

At this point, the influence of hydrodynamic parameters, the heat and mass transfer 
coefficients in the performance of bubble column has been discussed and it is vital to 
discuss the models used for their prediction. One of the tools used for the numerical 
simulation of bubble columns is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 
2.1.9. Application to bubble columns 
In modelling hydrodynamics in bubble column reactors using CFD, there are three 
modelling approaches which are normally used, namely Euler-Euler and Euler-
Lagrange and Direct Numerical Simulation. Euler-LaGrange treats the liquid phase in 
the Eulerian representation and the dispersed phase in the Lagrangian 
representation by tracking each individual fluid element in the reactor. In Euler-Euler 
approach both the liquid and dispersed phase are treated in Eulerian representation 
(Wu, Al-Dahhan & Prakash, 2007). Since Euler-Lagrange tracks each individual fluid 
element of the dispersed phase, it requires high computational memory and speed. 
In terms of computational expense, it is more expensive than Euler-Euler approach. 
The third modelling approach is direct numerical simulation (DNS). In DNS the single 
phase fluid equations are solved into two streams, coupled through appropriate 
dynamic and kinematic conditions at the interface (Brenner, 2005). Unlike the 
aforementioned modelling approaches, it does not require closure models. However, 
DNS has the disadvantage in that it is computationally expensive, limited to low 
Reynolds numbers and a finite number of fluid elements in the dispersed phase. 
DNS is therefore not suitable for most real applications. 
The choice of modelling approach is dependent on time and length scale as 
illustrated in Figure 4.

2.2. Computational fluid dynamics 
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a design tool that has been developed in the 
past few decades.  CFD solves Navier-Stokes equations that describe fluid flow 
numerically and its solution gives a good description of temperature, velocity and 
species concentration of the fluid flow. It is employed in a wide range of industrial 
applications such as chemical process engineering, aerospace and power 
generation (Guha et al., 2008;  Olmos et al., 2001;  Sanyal et al., 1999;  Sokolichin et 
al., 1997;  Sokolichin & Eigenberger, 1999). The use of high performance computer 
hardware and user friendly graphical interfaces has resulted in the wider application 
of CFD. 
2.2.1. Governing equations for fluid flow 
The governing equations of fluid flow and heat transfer are the representation of the 
mathematical statements of the conservation law of physics. Thus the set of 
equations solved in a CFD simulation are the Navier-Stokes equations in their 
conservative form. In solving these equations the fluid is regarded as a continuum 
and the behaviour of the fluid is described in terms of macroscopic properties such 
as temperature, pressure and velocity together with their space and time derivatives 
(Versteeg & Malalasekera., 2007). 

20 
 
2.2.1.1. 
Continuity equation 
The law of conservation of mass states that the rate of increase of mass in a fluid 
element is equal to the net rate of flow of mass into the fluid element. For an 
incompressible fluid in 2 dimensions, in the case where there is no mass creation or 
destruction considered, the mass of a fluid element contained in a volume (V(t)) can 
be expressed as shown in Equations (2.9) through (2.11).

When Equation (2.11) is cast in the so-called strong form, it results in the continuity 
equation given by Equation (2.12). The strong form refers to a set of partial 
differential equations describing a physical system. 
  
          
        (2.12) 
The continuity equation in its strong form holds for both compressible and 
incompressible fluid continuum. For an incompressible flow in two dimensions, the 
continuity equation has the form represented by Equation (2.13). One of the 
underlying assumptions is that the density is constant.

2.2.1.2. 
Momentum equation 
The momentum equation is derived from Newton’s second law which states that the 
rate of change of momentum equals the sum of the forces on a fluid particle. The x-
component of the momentum equation is calculated by taking the rate of change of 
x-momentum of the fluid particle equal to the total force in the x-direction on the 
element due to surface stresses plus the rate of increase of x-momentum due to 
sources. 
∑     
        (2.15) 
Newton’s second law is defined in the Lagrangian reference frame, and thus the 
relationship between velocity and acceleration can be described as illustrated by 
Equation (2.16).

constant viscosity and laminar flow (Welty, et al., 2001)

2.2.1.3. 
Energy equation 
The energy of a fluid element is defined as the sum of internal energy, kinetic energy 
and gravitational potential energy. The derivation of the energy equation is based on 
the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the rate of change of energy of a 
fluid particle is equal to the rate of heat addition to the fluid particle and the rate of 
work done on the fluid particle. The energy equation is presented in Equation (2.20).

The governing equations in conjunction with the boundary conditions yield the 
complete theoretical frame to depict the entire flow domain in terms of p, T, u and v. 
In the current study the Navier-Stokes equations will be discretised by finite volume 
method. 
2.2.2. Finite volume method 
There are three different methods of numerical solution techniques, namely finite 
difference, finite element and finite volume. The Finite volume method will be used in 
the current study. It entails integration of the governing equations over all the control 
volumes of the domain, discretisation and solution of the algebraic equations by an 
iterative method. In this method, the first step is to divide the domain into discrete 
volumes. This step is followed by integrating the governing equations over a control 
volume to get a discretised equation. The discretised equations are then set at each 
nodal point to get the concentration, velocity and temperature distribution at the 
nodal points. 
CFD is good for modelling continuous fluid and in the context of bubble columns; 
there is a continuous and dispersed phase. The combination of CFD with a model 
that is good at modelling the discrete fluid is therefore vital. Population Balance 
models are good at modelling the distribution of discrete entities and its combination 
with CFD is formidable. 
 

23 
 
2.3. Population Balance Modelling 
The Population Balance modelling is employed in a wide range of particulate 
processes such as precipitation, leaching, grinding, crystallization etc.  Although vast 
in number, there exists the common characteristics between all the particulate 
systems and that makes it possible to study them within the same mathematical 
framework (Population Balance). The common characteristics in all the particulate 
processes all of which can be modelled by a Population Balance Equation are the 
presence of the dispersed and continuous phases, birth and death of entities. The 
Population Balance Equation was first presented by Hulburt & Katz., (1964) and is 
now used in many applications including crystallization, flotation, gas-liquid 
dispersion and liquid-liquid extraction. The Population Balance for any system is a 
mathematical framework used to keep track of a number of entities such as bubbles, 
droplets, cells or solid particles (Scott & Richardson, 1997). The population in the 
system is described by the density of the extensive variables such as number, 
volume or mass of particles (Ramkrishna & Mahoney, 2002;  Yeoh & Tu, 2004).  The 
focus of PBM is on the distribution of the particle population and its impact on the 
system behaviour. In the system the particles either form or disappear and thus the 
number of particles changes with position and time in the reactor and this is taken 
into account by the Population Balance Model. The change in the number of 
particles is due to either break up or coalescence. In the break up process, the new 
particles are formed from the breakage of the parent particles. On other hand, in 
coalescence, particles collide and merge to form particles of bigger size. 
The form of a Population Balance Equation by Lerh & Mewes.,(2001) is as presented 
in Equation (2.21).

Where f is the bubble number density probability function and rB(v,v’) is the rate of 
breakage of a parent bubble of volume v into daughter bubbles of volume v’ and v-v’. 
rC (v-v’,v’) is the rate of coalescence of parent bubbles of volume v’ and v-v’ to form a 
bubble of volume v. 
2.2.3. Coalescence 
Coalescence is the process where particles collide and merge to form new particles. 
It is examined in terms of particles collision and the likelihood that their collision will 
result in coalescence. According to Prince & Blanch., (1990), coalescence of bubbles 
occurs in 3 steps. First, the bubbles collide and trap a small amount of fluid in 
between. The liquid then drains until the liquid film separating the two bubbles 
reaches a critical thickness and at this point the liquid film raptures and results in 
coalescence. The mechanism through which coalescence happens is illustrated in 
Figure 5. From the aforementioned steps that lead to coalescence, it can be 
concluded that coalescence rate is dependent on collision rate. In order for 
coalescence to take place, the contact time between two bubbles must be sufficient 
for the liquid film to reach a critical thickness necessary for rapture (Ramkrishna,  
2000).In addition to bubble contact time , collision efficiency is also necessary in 
determining whether collision will lead to coalescence. 
Bubbles collision in the reactor can occur due to turbulence, buoyancy and laminar 
shear (Prince & Blanch, 1990). In turbulence, the bubbles collide due to the 
fluctuating velocity of the liquid phase whereas in buoyancy collision happens due to 
the difference in rise velocities of bubbles of different sizes. 

25 
 
2.2.3.1. 
The turbulent collision rate 
In the turbulent collision type, the bubbles collide due to the fluctuating nature of the 
liquid phase velocity and the collision frequency that results from the turbulent 
motion of the liquid phase is as expressed in Equation (2.22). 
               (ῡ    ῡ   )

Where fi and fj are the number densities for the bubbles of size groups i and j. Sij is 
the cross-sectional are for collision of the bubbles, while ῡtj and ῡti are the average 
fluctuating velocities for the bubbles of sizes j and i respectively. Each of the 
aforementioned parameters can be expressed as shown in Equation (2.23).

        (2.23) 
Where rbi and rbj are the radii of the bubbles of sizes i and j respectively. The average 
turbulent fluctuating velocities can be expressed as a function of bubble size as 
presented in Equation (2.24).

        (2.24) 
2.2.3.2. 
Buoyancy-determined collision rate: 
In the buoyancy collision type, the bubbles collide as a result of their different rise 
velocities and the frequency of collisions that results from difference rise velocities is 
expressed in Equation (2.25). 
             𝑈   𝑈

        (2.26) 
2.2.3.3. 
Laminar shear collision rate: 
In the laminar shear collision type, the collision of particles results from the gross 
circulation pattern that is encountered in bubbles column operating at high gas flow 
rates and is expressed mathematically in Equation (2.27). 
         4
3             ( ῡ

        (2.27) 
From the different collision rates expressed above, the overall coalescence rate from 
model of Prince  & Blanch., (1990), is shown in Equation (2.28).

Where Ωc is the coalescence rate (m-3s-1), and θijT
,θijB
,θijLS, are turbulent collision 
rate, buoyancy driven collision rate and laminar shear collision rate respectively.

Equation (2.29).

the literature and among many; the one by Chesters (1991) is presented in Equation 
(2.30).

coalescence efficiency as illustrated in Equation (2.33).

28 
 
The results for simulating the total coalescence events of all bubbles in the column 
using the coalescence model by Saffman & Turner., (1956) are shown in Figure 6. It 
is evident from the results that the coalescence of a bubble of size i with all other 
bubbles in the column, shows higher rates and results in bubbles of greater  sizes 
than when the bubbles of size  classes j and k coalesce to form the bubbles of size  
class i. 
In the other case study, the coalescence model by Prince & Blanch., (1990) was 
used in simulating the total coalescence rate of bubbles of different sizes as 
illustrated in Figure 7. Upon comparing the results obtained from each coalescence 
model, it is evident that the coalescence model by Saffman & Turner., (1956) yields 
higher rates of coalescence in comparison to the coalescence model by Prince & 
Blanch (1990) under the same operating conditions. The above-mentioned 
distinction in the results found from the two coalescence models can be seen in the 
results depicted by Figure 6 and Figure 7. It was therefore concluded from the 
coalescence results simulated, that the coalescence model by Saffman &Turner,. 
(1956) would result in a pronounced influence of coalescence in the modelling of 
bubble size distribution and it was chosen over the other model by Prince & Blanch., 
(1990). In addition, the coalescence model by Prince & Blanch (1990) was 
developed for turbulent gas-liquid dispersions, while the current study investigated 
gas-liquid systems at low Re number and as a result the coalescence model by 
Saffman &Turner,. (1956). The model by Saffman and Turner was chosen because 
in its mathematical description it incorporates the diameters of the coalescing 
bubbles, bubble number density and the energy dissipation rate (ε) and was 
therefore found more suitable for the operating conditions in the current study

2.2.4. Break up 
Bubble break up happens when the bubble cannot withstand the internal forces or 
the external forces created by the surrounding fluid. The bubble break up can also 
be explained to occur when the bubbles collide with the turbulent eddies. The eddies 
that lead to bubble break up are those that have the length scale equal to or less

than the bubble size (Chen, Sanyal & Dudukovic, 2005). The eddies of length scale 
larger than the bubble size lead to bubble transport instead. The breakage 
mechanism is illustrated in Figure 8. The rate of breakage depends on the properties 
of the continuous and dispersed phase, such as density and viscosity and also on 
the flow properties such as the level of turbulence in the flow field (Lehr, Millies & 
Mewes, 2002; Luo & Svendsen, 1996; Prince & Blanch, 1990). For simplification, 
breakage is often assumed to be binary, although this is not the case in real 
breakage phenomena.

calculates the probability that a parent bubble will break to yield some daughter 
bubbles, it does not calculate the size distribution of daughter bubbles, and hence a 
redistribution function is needed (Patruno et al., 2009).  The redistribution function is 
expressed mathematically as shown on Equation (2.36).

all the breakage events for the bubbles of all size classes are shown in Figure 9. The 
observations in Figure 9 indicate that the breakage rate that leads to the birth of 
bubbles of size class i, is greater than the breakage rate in the case where bubbles 
of size class i die to result in bubbles of sizes less than i.

Contrary to the breakage model by Martínez Bazán., (1999), the break-up model by 
Luo & Svendsen., (1996) yielded higher rates of breakage when simulated. This can 
be seen when comparing the results obtained in each case as illustrated in Figure 9 
and Figure 10. In light of the results found in each case, it was concluded that the 
breakage model by Luo & Svendsen.,(1996) will give a significant difference 
between the inlet and final size distributions and was therefore used in the 
Population Balance Equation. The other reason for using the breakage model by Luo 
& Svendsen.,(1996) is that it was developed for the same system studied in the 
current study (air-water system). In addition, this model does not require predefined 
daughter bubble size distribution; the daughter bubble size distribution is calculated 
directly from the model. 
 
 
Figure 10: death and birth due to breakage of bubbles (simulated from the model by Luo & 
Svendsen., (1996)) 
Most breakage models reported assume binary breakage, however in a real physical 
system when the particles break; there are small and many bubble fragments that 
result. The small fragments affect the hydrodynamics in the bubble column and 
therefore it is vital to develop breakup models which will take this phenomenon into 
account. It has also been established that the size of bubbles in the column does not 
only depend on coalescence and breakage, but also on mass transfer from bubbles 
to the liquid phase.  As such, the ability of Population Balance Model to predict

bubble size distribution can be combined with CFD to predict the influence of bubble 
size in the flow field. On the mass transfer from bubbles to the liquid phase, CFD can 
be used to predict this phenomenon and as a result the influence of mass transfer on 
bubble size can be accounted for when PBM is incorporated into CFD. 
2.3. Incorporating Population Balance into CFD 
Over the past two decades bubble column reactors have found a wide application in 
industries such as mining, food, petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical (Luo & 
Svendsen, 1996).This is due to their high rates of heat and mass transfer, ease of 
operation, no moving parts and easy construction. The work done in modelling 
hydrodynamics in these reactors includes experimental and modelling work. In the 
past years only CFD was used in modelling the hydrodynamics in these reactors, 
however some improvements were done by incorporating Population Balance into 
CFD to include bubble size distribution. 
Sokolichin & Eigenberger (1994) used one bubble size class to model drag force 
term which is one of the key closures in the Euler-Euler framework. Bubble breakup 
and coalescence were not considered and the mass exchange between the liquid 
and gas phase was not considered as well. The use of constant bubble size in the 
churn-turbulent flow regime is not a justified choice as bubble size distribution is wide 
due to strong bubble-eddy collision and bubble-bubble interaction. 
In view of the importance of bubble size distribution in the performance of bubble 
column reactors, Shimizu et al. (2000) developed a simulation model based on gas 
hold-up and gas-liquid mass transfer. The column was compartmentalised, and the 
movement of the bubbles from one compartment to another was described. Gas 
hold-up and interfacial area were calculated from bubble size distribution which is 
predicted from the Population Balance Equation. In the prediction of mass transfer 
coefficient the penetration theory which is dependent on bubble rise velocity was 
used. The bubble rise velocity used is by Clift et.al. (1978) and the results could be 
accurate if the bubble rise velocity is calculated from the microscopic force balance. 
Their findings indicate that the evaluation of gas holdup and volumetric mass transfer 
rates depends primarily on breakup and coalescence phenomena. 

35 
 
Krishna et al. (2000) developed a model for predicting scale dependence of bubble 
column reactors operating in the churn-turbulent flow regime. In their work, the 
bubble column reactor was considered to be made up of small and big bubbles and 
all the phases were described in the Eulerian framework. The interaction between 
bubbles was ignored and this is not a justified assumption in the churn-turbulent 
regime where there is a strong bubble-bubble interaction and a wide bubble size 
distribution. Their findings indicate that there is a good agreement between 
experimental and simulated results for gas hold-up and liquid velocity. However 
these results can be improved by implementing Population Balance Model to 
account for bubble-bubble interactions. 
Van Baten & Krishna (2011) improved the work by Krishna et al. (2000) in that they 
followed exactly the same modelling approach but for bubble column reactors 
operating at an elevated pressure. Although this work was an improvement from the 
previous work, it still has some limitations in that it does not consider the bubble size 
evolution and its influence in the flow field. 
Olmos et al. (2001) combined PMB with Euler-Euler CFD representation to 
investigate the operation of a cylindrical bubble column. This was done by using 
Multiple Size Group (MUSIG) model implemented in CFX.4.3 commercial software. 
The MUSIG is a model based on the two-fluid model and the Population Balance 
approach. It was found that the hydrodynamic variables such as axial liquid velocity 
and local gas hold-up are in good agreement with the experimental data. However, 
when the flow is no longer homogenous, the predicted local Gas hold up was found 
to give unreliable results. The results of the predicted bubble size distribution were 
compared with the experimental results from the photographic technique and a good 
agreement was found. The limitation in the model developed is that when the flow 
transition begins, the predicted hydrodynamic variables no longer show a good 
agreement with experimental data. 
Chen et al. (2005) implemented Population Balance Equation into CFD Euler-Euler 
representation to determine how well time averaged liquid axial velocity, kinetic 
energy profiles and gas hold-up profiles can be predicted. It was found that a good 
agreement between experimental and modelling work was found in terms of liquid 
axial velocity and kinetic energy profiles, however in terms of gas hold-up no realistic 

36 
 
results were found. This could be explained by the fact that they used 2-D 
axisymmetric simulation which does not capture the dynamic features of the flow 
field like the 3-D simulations do. 
On the other study, Wang et al. (2006) developed a coupled CFD-PBM model to use 
the ability of CFD to calculate the entire flow field and that of PBM to calculate 
bubble size distribution. In their work, the Population Balance was not implemented 
into CFD by using the multiple-size group (MUSIG) as it was done in the previous 
works. The MUSIG model is in the commercial CFD package, CFX and its breakup 
and coalescence closures cannot be used over a wide range of operating conditions. 
In their work, a full Population Balance Model with detailed coalescence and breakup 
closure was implanted into Euler-Euler CFD representation. A good agreement was 
found to experimental data in terms of gas hold-up profiles, liquid velocity and bubble 
size distribution. It was also concluded that breakup and coalescence closures are 
important in reliably predicting bubble size evolution in both heterogeneous and 
homogeneous flow regimes. However, this conclusion contradicts with the work of 
Chen et al. (2005) who concluded that the choice of break up and coalescence 
closures does not have impact on the simulated results. 
Wang et al. (2005) used the notion that bubble size distribution plays an important 
role in the flow regime transition to develop a theoretical model based on PBM. The 
bubble size distribution is effectively predicted from PBM, and from the bubble size 
distribution flow regime transition can be predicted thereof. In their work, the two-fluid 
model was combined with PBM and in this case all the bubble sizes were assumed 
to have the same rise velocity. This assumption is justified in the homogenous flow 
regime, but cannot be applied in the heterogeneous flow regime where there is 
strong bubble-bubble interaction and bubble-eddy interaction. The findings in their 
study indicate that bubble size distribution becomes wider with the increase of gas 
hold-up. It was found out that in the heterogeneous flow regime, bubble size 
distribution approaches equilibrium within a short period of time due to intensive 
nature of break-up and coalescence at this flow regime. 
 Ekambara & Dhotre., (2007) combined PBM and CFD approach for simulating the 
flow in an oscillatory baffled column. In coupling PBM with CFD, the Eulerian-
Eulerian two-fluid model was used.  Break up and coalescence were considered in 

37 
 
simulating the hydrodynamics. The MUSIG model was used in determining the 
temporal and geometrical changes of the gas bubbles .Their findings indicate that 
the predicted hydrodynamics variables such as liquid velocity, local gas hold-up 
showed good agreement to the experimental data. 
Bhole et al. (2008) developed a combined CFD-PBM model in the Eulerian 
framework for the simulation of axisymmetric steady state flows in bubble column 
reactors. They calculated bubble size evolution from Population Balance Equation 
and its influence in the flow field was calculated from CFD. In their work, the 
assumption of identical velocities for bubbles of all sizes which was used in previous 
work was eliminated by considering the simplified gas momentum equation. Thus in 
this case the bubbles of different sizes were taken to move at different velocities and 
the momentum balance for each size was solved.  The simplified gas momentum 
equation is called an algebraic slip model and since it’s an algebraic model, it solves 
for the gas velocity in one step. They found that with CFD-PBM approach there is a 
good agreement between numerical and experimental results for gas hold-up, axial 
liquid velocity and kinetic energy in bubble column reactors. The limitation in this 
study is that the full momentum equation for the gas phase is not solved since they 
looked at the steady state simulation. In the cases where flow around individual 
bubbles at fine grid and time step is needed the algebraic slip model is not 
applicable. 
 
Although there has been an improvement in the modelling of bubble columns by 
incorporating Population Balance into CFD as intimated, there are some challenges 
that still remain and those include the correct understanding of the physics in 
multiphase flow, generic models that can be applied over a wide range of operating 
conditions and computational expense. 
 
2.6. Experimental work on investigating the hydrodynamics in bubble 
columns 
On the experimental work for determination of gas hold-up, Wu et al. (2001) used 
gamma ray computed tomography. The experiments were conducted over a range of 
superficial velocities (2 cm/s to 60 cm/s), at different pressures (0.1-1.0 MPa) with 5 

38 
 
different spargers and columns of different diameters ranging from (0.19-0.44 m). 
Their findings indicate that, gas hold-up profiles change significantly with gas 
velocity. On the effect of pressure they reported that, as pressure increases, the 
bubble size distribution becomes narrow and this results in flatter gas hold-up which 
is ascribed to uniform distribution of small bubbles. The effect of column diameter on 
gas hold-up was also investigated, but the findings did not agree well with the known 
and reported fact that, at larger column diameters, the liquid recirculation increases 
hence steeper hold-up profiles are expected. 
 
The study on the independent determination of mass transfer coefficient and 
interfacial area was undertaken by Bouaifi et al., (2001).  The local Gas hold-up was 
determined by an optical probe connected to an Optoelectronic type Y module linked 
to a computer. Their findings indicate that, for all types of sparges used, gas hold-up 
increases with increasing superficial gas velocity. The porous and membrane 
spargers were found to result in gas hold-up values greater than those in a 
perforated plate sparger. This can be attributed to bubble size, gas hold-up in a 
system of small bubbles is bigger than that in big bubble system. In addition, bubble 
size is dependent on the type of sparger used, hence different results are found for 
different sparger types. 
 
Jamialahmadi & Müuller-Steinhagen (1993) conducted experiments in two different 
columns using air and water at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure to 
investigate the effect of superficial velocity in bubble size, terminal bubble rise 
velocity and gas hold-up. They highlighted the need for reliable estimate of the 
aforementioned hydrodynamic parameters as they are directly related to the transfer 
coefficient and transfer area. In their experiments, they measured bubble size and 
bubble rise velocity using a micro-processor controlled camera and video equipment 
in a two dimensional column. In the other set of experiments, a three dimensional 
column was used and gas hold-up was measured from bed expansion. In their 
findings it was demonstrated that the bubble diameter and gas hold-up increased 
with increasing superficial gas velocity. Correlations for mean diameter and gas hold-
up were derived. 

39 
 
On the experimental work, Degaleesan et al., (2001) used computer-automated 
radioactive particle tracking technique to investigate turbulence and liquid circulation 
in bubble columns. The time average liquid velocity for columns of different sizes at 
different operating conditions was investigated. Their findings indicate that time 
average liquid velocity changes as the superficial gas velocity changes from 2.4 cm/s 
to 12 cm/s and that this might mean that there is a change of flow regime from 
bubbly flow to churn-turbulent. 
On the experimental determination of bubble size distribution and gas hold-up in 
bubble columns, Lage & Esposito., (1999) measured bubble diameters for a bubble 
column operating in a homogenous regime at different values of superficial gas 
velocity. In their work, it was assumed that the bubbles rise unperturbed and as a 
result a direct relationship between bubble rise velocity and residence time is 
achieved. This resulted in bubble size distribution in the column being determined 
from experimental data using the conservation form of the bubble size distribution 
function. The findings of their study indicate that at homogenous flow regime, the 
bubble size distribution does not vary significantly along the column. However, in 
other the flow regimes a non-uniform size distribution is observed and as a result the 
shape of the bubbles changes from sphericity to other shapes and their velocities 
differ.  
2.4. Summary of literature review 
Although over the past years there have been some improvements in the modelling 
of bubble columns by integrating PBM into CFD, the current models are 
computationally expensive and require high performance computing hardware. The 
development of a fast-solving model to mitigate the computational burden promises 
to be a better modelling approach in simulating bubble columns and can lead to a 
wider application of PBM-CFD models. In addition, it is necessary to develop generic 
models that predict hydrodynamic variables for a wide range of operating conditions 
as most of the current models are restricted to the conditions under which they were 
developed. 
From the aforementioned previous work on prediction of hydrodynamics in bubble 
column reactors, it can be said that it is still difficult to obtain the prediction of 
hydrodynamic parameters for a particular system geometry over a wide range of 

40 
 
conditions. For instance, some studies investigate only the influence of column 
diameter on heat and mass transfer, whereas the hydrodynamics are influenced by 
many factors such as particle size, fluid velocity, density and thermal conductivity. In 
addition, in the context of heat transfer, most of the studies concerned time averaged 
local heat transfer coefficient and this does not give more information on 
instantaneous effect of bubble dynamics on heat transfer.   
The studies based on CFD are limited to homogeneous regime as they consider only 
one bubble size. However, as the flow transition begins there is a complex 
interaction between the continuous and dispersed phase. It is therefore necessary to 
integrate Population Balance into CFD modelling of bubble columns for a better 
understanding of different flow regimes and bubble characteristics in bubble columns 
design and optimization. For reliable design and scale-up of these reactors, the gap 
in the literature needs to be filled by developing models that predict the heat transfer 
coefficient under a wide range of conditions. Coupling Population Balance with 
Computational Fluid Dynamics can improve the predicted heat and mass transfer 
coefficients. This is because interfacial area is an important parameter in heat and 
mass transfer coefficient calculations and including PBM to account for bubble size 
evolution can result in a reliable predictor.

3. Research objectives and key questions 
 The current study attempted to approximate accuracy by accepting the work of 
others as benchmarks to validate the developed model against. The studies in the 
previous years have shown that the incorporation of CFD into the Population 
Balance framework results in the accurate prediction of hydrodynamics in bubble 
columns. This is ascribed to the fact that the Population Balance Model has the 
ability to calculate particle size distribution, and the impact of size distribution in the 
flow field can be predicted from CFD. In addition, the incorporation of CFD into the 
PBM framework allows for the decoupling of the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient 
and the specific interfacial area which helps in investigating what the mass transfer 
rate will be in the column. In spite of this major development in the modelling of 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns, computational expense still remains one of the 
major challenges. It is therefore vital to develop models that reduce the 
computational expense, while maintaining the accuracy in the prediction of the 
hydrodynamics of interest. In addition, there are many correlations reported for the 
prediction of hydrodynamics variables such as, Sauter mean diameter, interfacial 
area and gas hold-up. However, these correlations cannot predict the 
aforementioned parameters over a wide range of operating conditions as most of 
them are specific to the conditions under which they were derived, equipment type 
and geometry. Thus, it still remains a challenge to develop generic models that are 
computationally efficient and that also capture all the dynamic features of the 
multiphase flow even for heterogeneous flow regimes. As such, it is the objective of 
this study to develop a fundamental model that accurately predicts hydrodynamic 
parameters over a range of Re numbers. 
3.1. Research objectives 
The current study aspired to meet the flowing objectives. 
Overall aim of the study 

42 
 
 Development of a fundamental model that accurately predicts hydrodynamic 
parameters over a wide range of Re numbers 
 
Measurable objectives of the study 
 Predict gas hold-up, interfacial area, mass transfer rate and Sauter mean 
diameter. 
 To decouple the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient (kL) from the specific 
interfacial area (a), and investigate what the mass transfer rate will be in the 
column. 
 To employ the analogy between heat and mass transfer in the prediction of 
heat transfer coefficient from mass transfer results. 
 To compare the predicted flow field with the published experimental data for 
an air-water system. (That is to validate population balance with heat and 
mass integration).  
3.2. Hypothesis 
The impact of bubble size distribution in the flow field can be reliably predicted by 
integrating Bubble Cell Model into the Population Balance framework. Size 
distribution is an important parameter for modelling hydrodynamics in multi-phase 
reactors, as it affects mass transfer by changing the interfacial area. 
3.3. Key questions 
 How is Bubble Cell Model going to be integrated into the Population balance 
framework? 
 Are the changes in the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient (kL) greater than the 
changes in the specific interfacial area? 
 Does the integration of BCM into the PBM framework yield the results that 
mimic reality? 
  Does the determination of heat transfer coefficient from mass transfer results 
yield accurate results?

4. Model development 
In multiphase modelling, there are several modelling techniques that are employed, 
namely: Euler-Euler, Euler-Lagrange, Direct Numerical Simulation etc. The intimated 
modelling techniques are fluid property simulations that solve momentum, mass and 
energy balance problems and in the context of bubble columns, they all take bubble 
size to be constant. A commonly applied assumption is that bubble size is constant. 
However, bubble columns have special needs in that there are bubbles of different 
sizes in which case the constant size assumption must be relaxed. Over the past 
years there has been  extensive work in incorporating PBM in CFD to model local 
size distribution, and thus local mass transfer coefficient, local gas hold-up and local 
interfacial area (Scott & Richardson, 1997).  
A Population Balance Model has the ability to predict local interfacial area and the 
two-fluid model is used in most studies to predict mass transfer coefficient(Olmos et 
al., 2001), thus the incorporation of Population Balance Modelling into the Euler-
Euler approach makes it possible to determine the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient 
and interfacial area separately .The separate prediction of these two parameters 
allow for decoupling transfer mechanisms, and it can therefore be determined which 
factor controls mass transfer (Bouaifi et al., 2001). The independent determination of 
the intimated parameters is vital as it cannot be predicted what the mass transfer 
rate will be when the bubbles rise through the column, since it is not known if the 
changes in the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient will be greater than the changes in 
the interfacial area. For this reason, it is important to decouple (kL) from (a), and 
once that is done, it becomes possible to investigate this question. Therefore in 
adopting this approach, the use of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) in its 
lumped form (intrinsic mass transfer coefficient multiplied with specific interfacial 
area) can be obviated. The current work aimed at integrating Bubble Cell Model into 
the Population Balance framework as the aforementioned modelling approaches 
demand high computational time and memory requirement. In this section, a detailed 
methodology on how the BCM was integrated into the PBM framework will be 
presented. The low computational expense of BCM makes it suitable as a sub-model 

44 
 
in the macro-modelling of hydrodynamics in bubble columns making its integration 
into the PBM framework feasible. 
4.1.Bubble Cell Model 
In its current development, a Bubble Cell Model is an algebraic model that predicts 
the spatial velocity vector fields in the vicinity of a single bubble (Coetzee et al., 
2011). The extension of BCM to concentration and thermal gradients can therefore 
prove vital in the modelling of bubble column reactors. In a similar approach to that 
of velocity vector fields, in the context of concentration fields, BCM can be extended 
to predict spatial concentration fields in the vicinity of a single bubble. In the 
prediction of spatial concentration fields using BCM, Reynolds number is specified 
and the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved in CFD. Upon solving the Navier-
Stokes equation, pressure, velocity, concentration and temperature fields can then 
be determined. Since the current work focuses on the concentrations fields, only the 
concentration gradients determination will be discussed in this section. Upon the 
determination of concentrations fields and mass transfer coefficient thereof, heat 
transfer coefficient is predicted from mass transfer results by employing the analogy 
that exists between heat and mass transfer as illustrated in section (2.1.8). 
The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances and they are 
derived from assuming that the fluid under study is a continuum i.e.  the fluid element 
is not moving at relativistic velocity (Batchelor,1967). The Equations (4.1) and (4.2) 
represent the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible flow of Newtonian 
fluids. The solution of the Navier-Stokes equations yields the data to be 
approximated which can be velocity gradients, pressure gradients, heat and mass 
transfer coefficients. In the current work, the data to be approximated constitute the 
heat and mass transfer coefficients.  The mass transfer coefficient is approximated 
from BCM by specifying Reynolds and Sherwood numbers and the heat transfer 
coefficient is approximated from mass transfer results by employing the analogy that 
exists between heat and mass transfer. 
      
        (4.1) 
 

45 
 
          
 
                    
         (4.2) 
The mass transfer coefficient was approximated by correlating Reynolds and 
Sherwood numbers. The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved in CFD and that 
yields the concentration profiles in the vicinity of a single bubble. The data from the 
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is used to predict mass transfer coefficient 
by employing the film theory. The data from CFD for approximating the mass transfer 
coefficient in the vicinity of a single bubble at the Reynolds (Re) is fitted with a 
polynomial and this makes it possible to predict mass transfer coefficient at the new 
Reynolds number (Re1). The Matlab function polyfit presented in Equation (4.3) finds 
the coefficients of a polynomial of the degree of interest that fits the data .The 
correlation of Reynolds and Sherwood numbers is done as follows: 
                 3      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (4.3) 
In Equation (4.3), Re number used to generate data from CFD is correlated with 
Sherwood number and this makes it possible to approximate Sherwood number from 
any Reynolds number given and that is done as follows: 
                       
         (4.4) 
The Matlab function polyval presented in Equation (4.4) takes the input argument km 
and returns a polynomial of the degree of interest evaluated at Re1. At the new 
Reynolds number (Re1), Sherwood number is approximated as illustrated in 
Equation (4.4) and mass transfer coefficient can be predicted thereof. This makes 
BCM extremely fast in predicting hydrodynamic variables as opposed to the Euler-
Euler, Euler-LaGrange and Direct Numerical Simulation. The computational time of 
the method proposed will be demonstrated in the sections to follow.

The film theory is used for the determination of mass transfer coefficient. From the 
film theory, the mass transfer coefficient is calculated from concentration boundary 
layer and mass diffusivity as shown in Equation (4.5).

The results in Table 2 demonstrate mass transfer coefficient predicted at various Re 
numbers and these results are found from solving Navier-Stokes equations in CFD. 
The data in Table 2 were fitted with a polynomial of 3rd degree and from the fitting 
demonstrated in Equation (4.3). The 3rd degree polynomial was chosen as higher 
order polynomials are oscillatory and their usage can result in a polynomial that 
oscillates between the points of constraint. The resulting polynomial was found to be 
of the following form: 
         4           4 5                      4  
            (4.6) 
In the context of BCM, for any given Re number less than 270, the Sherwood 
number can be approximated using Equation (4.6) and the mass transfer coefficient 
can be predicted thereof.  
The results for concentration and thermal boundary layers are demonstrated in 
Figure 12 and it can be seen that at the back of the bubble, there is a flow separation 
point and the boundary layer becomes bigger. The observed phenomenon calls for a 

47 
 
need to average the boundary layer as it is not uniform along the bubble surface. 
The averaging is done as observed in Equation (4.7). 
   
 ∫    
 
 
   
         (4.7) 
Thus for an angle (θ) along the circumference of the bubble, the boundary layer can 
be averaged as shown in Equation (4.7).  
  
 
 
The Bubble Cell Model entails two stage fitting process. In the first stage, the spatial 
concentration fields are approximated, and in the second stage, the stage one model 
parameters are pre-correlated as a function of Reynolds number.  In the first method, 
as illustrated above, Reynolds number was correlated with Sherwood number and 
an algebraic equation was derived. The derived equation expresses Sherwood 
number as a function of Reynolds number. In the second method, Reynolds number 
was correlated with the concentration boundary layer and the algebraic equation was 
derived which expresses concentration boundary layer as a function of Reynolds 
number. The mass transfer coefficient was predicted from the two methods and the 
results were compared as depicted in Figure 11.  When varying the Reynolds 
number to predict mass transfer coefficient, the two methods show a close 
agreement with an average relative difference of 0.8 %.

Upon fitting the data in Table 3 to derive a correlation that expresses concentration 
boundary layer as a function of Reynolds number, the mathematical formulation as 
illustrated in Equation (4.8) is found.  The expression makes it possible to predict the 
concentration boundary layer from Reynolds number as the input and upon 
predicting the boundary layer, the mass transfer coefficient can be predicted using 
the film theory as illustrated in Equation (4.5).

Since BCM is Reynolds number dependent, the bubble rise velocity for the 
population of bubbles was calculated from force balance, and their Reynolds number 
used to predict mass transfer coefficient. A schematic diagram on how BCM was 
integrated into the PBM framework is shown in Figure 25. 
4.1.1. Bubble rise velocity 
Bubble rise velocity is one of the most important parameters that govern the 
performance of a bubble column reactor.  The hydrodynamic parameters such as 
gas hold-up, mass transfer and interfacial area are influenced by the bubble rise 
velocity; because bubble rise velocity dictates how much time a bubble spends in the 
column.The rise velocity of bubbles is calculated from the macroscopic force balance 
and can be expressed mathematically as illustrated in Equation (4.9).

Where the forces on the right hand side of the equation represent gravity, pressure 
gradient, drag, lift and virtual mass. The closure correlations for the forces on the 
right hand side are reported in the literature (Delnoij et al., 1997) and they are as 
shown in Equation (4.10) through (4.14).

 The bubble rise velocity at each time step in the column is calculated as presented 
in Equation (4.15). 
                 
  
    
        (4.15) 
Where u (j) is the velocity of a bubble at its current position and u (j-1) is its velocity 
from previous position, the time step Δt, and its acceleration 
     
   at the current 
position.  However in the current work, the bubble terminal velocity is considered and 
it is calculated from assuming a net force of zero from the forces mentioned above 
and it is calculated as follows: 
                             √
               
 
                
       (4.16)  
The bubble terminal velocity calculated from force balance in Equation (4.16) was 
validated against the bubble rise velocity from the other forms of force balances 
reported in the literature. The results in Figure 13 show that the bubble rise velocity 
calculated from force balance in the model are in good agreement to the bubble rise 

51 
 
velocity calculated from the other forms of force balance reported in the literature. 
The terminal bubble rise velocity as reported by Tabib et al., (2008) is as illustrated 
by Equation (4.17)

With the knowledge of bubble rise velocity, the mass transfer coefficient for a 
population of bubbles was calculated from correlating Sherwood and Reynolds 
number as mentioned earlier. 
4.1.2. Boundary conditions 
The data to be approximated was found from a CFD package named FLUENT by 
solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The illustration of the system geometry and its 
meshing to approximate the flow field in the vicinity of a single bubble is presented in 
Figure 14. The solutions from CFD depend on the MESH size and the accurate 
results are found in cases where the solution is grid independent. In the current 
study the MESH size was refined in GAMBIT and an optimum MESH size 
corresponding to 166816 elements was chosen.The methodology on how the 
simulations were carried out is illustrated in Figure 15.  In numerical analysis of a 
system, a unique solution is found by specifying information on flow (or any

dependent) variables at the domain boundaries.  In the current work the boundary 
conditions are velocity inlet, outflow, symmetry and axis, wall and bubble. 
 
Figure 14: Mesh generation for the system under study 
 Velocity Inlet 
In the incompressible flow, one of the system boundary conditions is the velocity 
inlet. The inlet velocities used were in the range 0.0893 to 0.271 m/s and that 
translates to Re number in the range 100 to 270. 
 Outflow  
In the case of outflow, pressure and velocity need not to be specified as the data at 
the exit plane is extrapolated from the interior (Fluent, 2009). The mass balance 
correction is applied in the outflow boundary. 
 Symmetry and axis 
In the context of symmetry boundary, the requirement is that the flow and geometry 
be symmetric. The importance of this boundary is that it reduces computational effort 
for the problem under study (Fluent, 2009). 
 Wall 
For the wall, the zero-shear-stress (free-slip) condition has been adopted at the 
rectangular wall. This choice was based on the notion that the walls do not represent 
the actual walls of a bubble column, but are only used to create a computational 
domain where the fluid around the bubble is bound (Fluent, 2009). 

53 
 
 Bubble 
The bubbles in the bubble column do not exert a shear stress to the continuous 
phase and in light of that a zero-shear-stress was adopted.

4.2. Numerical estimation of heat and mass transfer coefficients 
Heat and mass transfer coefficients are the important design parameters in bubble 
columns and the accurate prediction of these parameters is crucial. Mass transfer 
refers to the relative motion of species from one phase, stream or component to 
another due to concentration gradients. In the current study, mass transfer is from 
the gas bubbles to the continuous phase and the methodology on how total mass 
transfer was calculated will be outlined. 

54 
 
The mass balance on the solution surrounding the bubbles under the assumption of 
perfect mixing and the volume and volumetric flow-rate being time constants, can be 
expressed as shown in Equation (4.18) 
       
  
           
 
    
        
(4.18) 
Where rA is the mass transfer rate and can be expressed as shown in Equation 
(4.19). 
                 
        
(4.19) 
Substituting rA into Equation (4.18), the following form is found: 
      
  
          
 
                
               
(4.20) 
In the current study, steady state is considered, and the term on the left side of 
Equation (4.20) becomes zero, and the concentration of air can be expressed as 
shown In Equation (4.21). 
                   
         
 
        
(4.21) 
Where ap is the gas-liquid interfacial area. cA0 is the gas initial concentration in the 
column, cAs is the gas concentration at the gas-liquid interface and cAb is the gas 
concentration in the bulk liquid. The interface gas concentration is calculated from 
Henry’s law because at the interphase equilibrium is achieved. The data on the 
Henry’s constant of Air is not readily available for specific operating conditions. Since 

55 
 
Air comprises Oxygen and Nitrogen, the concentrations of the two were calculated 
and from their results air concentration was calculated as presented in Equation 
(4.22). 
                
       (4.22) 
Where P is total pressure, Y02 is the mole fraction of Oxygen in the gas phase, XO2 is 
mole fraction of Oxygen in the liquid phase, ɣO2 is the activity coefficient and H is the 
Henry’s constant. 
     
   
           
Thus for an ideal solution ɣ*
O2 =1, and Equation (4.22) reduces to the form 
expressed in Equation (4.23). 
 
                
       (4.23) 
 
 
 
 
       
   
 
       (4.24) 
The units of the solubility are g/L and to convert this to concentration of oxygen (C02) 
in water, the solubility calculated in Equation (4.24) is divided by the Molecular 
weight of oxygen. The similar methodology is followed for the concentration of 
Nitrogen, and upon getting the concentrations of Oxygen and Nitrogen in the liquid 
phase; the concentration of air is calculated as shown in Equation (4.25). 
    ∑     
        
(4.25) 

56 
 
Where xj is the mole fraction of compound j in water and C is the concentration. The 
other parameter that needs to be known for the determination of total mass transfer 
rate is the mass transfer coefficient. In the current study, the intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient is predicted from BCM by employing the two film theory as illustrated in 
section (4.5) 
4.2.1. Heat and mass transfer analogy 
An analogy exists in the mathematical descriptions of both heat and mass transfer 
and in the conditions where this analogy holds, heat transfer can be predicted from 
mass transfer results, thus obviating a need to perform heat transfer coefficient 
determination which is normally a difficult task to achieve experimentally. The 
analogy can further be seen in the predicted thermal and concentration boundary 
layers which follow the same trend as depicted in Figure 12. The boundary layer 
results as shown in Figure 12 are in agreement with the reported work (Khan & Pop, 
2010) on concentration and thermal boundary layer, which states that the thermal 
boundary layer is larger in thickness as compared to the concentration boundary 
layer. In the current study, this analogy was tested and found to hold as illustrated in 
Figure 18.  The heat transfer coefficient was predicted from CFD and the results 
were compared with the heat transfer coefficient predicted from mass transfer 
results. The findings indicate that heat transfer coefficient predicted from both cases 
show a similar trend and the average difference between the two methods is 7.63 %. 
 
Upon averaging the boundary layers in the vicinity of a single bubble as illustrated in 
Equation (4.7), the thermal and concentration boundary layers are as depicted in 
Figure 16 and Figure 17. The results for the two boundary layers show a similar 
trend and it can be concluded that heat and mass transfer follow the same velocity 
profile and this is a condition to be met for the analogy to be applicable. The 
graphical representation in Figure 12 shows the temperature and concentration 
profiles around a spherical bubble, and when averaging the profiles, the numerical 
results of the boundary layers can be observed in Figure 16 and Figure 17. The 
findings are in agreement with the general notion that the thermal boundary layer is 
greater in magnitude compared to the concentration boundary layer.

The determination of heat transfer coefficient from mass transfer coefficient was 
performed as demonstrated in section (2.1.8).  The heat transfer coefficient results 
were validated by comparing the predicted Nusselt number with the Nusselt number 
calculated from empirical correlations.

4.3. Population Balance Model 
The Population Balance Equation was first presented by Hulburt & Katz,. (1964) and 
is now used in many applications including crystallization, flotation, gas-liquid 
dispersion and liquid-liquid extraction. The Population Balance for any system is a 
mathematical framework used to determine property distributions of discrete 
properties such as particles, oil droplets and gas bubbles (Ramkrishna & Mahoney, 
2002;  Yeoh & Tu, 2004). The population in the system is described by the density of 
the extensive variables such as number, volume or mass of particles (Ramkrishna & 
Mahoney, 2002;  Yeoh & Tu, 2004).  The focus of PBM is on the distribution of the 
particle population and its impact in the system behaviour. In the system the particles 
either form or disappear and thus the number of particles changes with position and 
time in the reactor and this is taken into account by a Population Balance. In the 
context of gas bubbles, the change in the number of particles is due to either break 
up or coalescence. In the break up process, the new smaller particles are formed 
from the breakage of the parent particles. On other hand, in coalescence, particles 
collide and merge to form particles of bigger size. 
The general Population Balance Equation is expressed mathematically as follows:

(4.26) 
In Equation (4.26), α is the chosen set of properties (e.g. size, position, activity etc.). 
The factor   ̇  is the rate at which the property (α) changes with time, thus the 
second term on the left hand side represents the change at which properties of the 
population change spontaneously with time. The terms on the right hand side 
represent the rate at which bubbles are born and die from the population due to 
break up and coalescence. The first term on the right hand side represents the birth 
of particles due to break up or coalescence, while the second term represents death 
of particles due to the same processes. 
 Since (α) is a set of properties as indicated, in the present case a more appropriate 
choice to a bubble column was made by assuming (α) to be a set of spatial co-
ordinates and bubble diameter. Therefore, the internal co-ordinates considered are 
the bubble number density probability distribution, bubble diameter and the spatial 
coordinates. The first term in the left hand side of the equation represents the 
change in ψ with respect to time.  In the context of a Population Balance Equation, ψ 
is a multivariable distribution function, where the variables of the distribution are the 
properties α. 
 From the general form of a Population Balance Equation as presented in Equation 
(4.26), the form adopted in the current study is as follows: 
       
  
      
 (    
   
  
)  
        ∫

        (4.27) 

60 
 
In the form of the Population Balance Equation in (4.27); the first term on the right 
hand side represents the change in bubble diameter due to mass transfer, the 
second and third terms represent the birth and death of bubbles due to break up. 
The last two terms are the representation of birth and death due to coalescence. The 
steady state population balance was adopted, and thus the first term in the left hand 
side becomes zero and the variation of the properties is considered in one 
dimensional space (axial). This term can be expanded as follows: 
       (  
       )    
         
 
      
          
(4.28) 
When adapting the steady state context, the bubbles are assumed to rise at terminal 
velocity and as a result the variation of bubble velocity with respect to column height 
becomes zero, thus the first term in Equation (4.28) becomes zero. Since all the 
bubbles attain terminal velocity, the collision is linked to bubble size as only the mass 
of the bubble will affect the velocity in this case.  The bubble terminal velocity is 
calculated from force balance as illustrated in Equation (4.16). It was stated 
previously from the work of Bhole et al., (2008) that the use of steady state 
simulation has limitations in that the full momentum equations for the gas phase is 
not solved. However in the current study, with fully knowledge of this limitation, a 
steady state Population Balance Equation was used. This was done because the 
current study aimed at integrating BCM into the PBM framework to predict the 
hydrodynamic parameters over a wide range of Re numbers. Upon a successful 
integration of BCM into the PBM framework for mild conditions, the unsteady state 
simulations can then be incorporated to enhance the accuracy of the predicted 
hydrodynamic parameters. 
The right hand side of the Population Balance Equation (4.27) represents death (D) 
and birth (B) of particles due to break up and coalescence, and upon solving the 
PBE, the knowledge of the functions that describe break up and coalescence is 
essential. There are several models for both break up and coalescence reported in 
the literature. 

61 
 
4.3.1. Coalescence model 
Coalescence is the process whereby particles collide and merge to form new 
particles. It is examined in terms of particles collision and the likelihood that their 
collision will result in coalescence. Several coalescence models have been reported 
in the literature. The coalescence model of Prince & Blanch., (1990) is as shown in 
Equation (2.9). 
 
                         
   
     
 
 
 
                                (4.29)
 
 
                  
Where Ωc is the coalescence rate (m-3s-1), and θij
T
,θij
B
,θij
LS are; turbulent collision rate, 
buoyancy driven collision rate and laminar shear collision rate respectively. 
 
4.3.1.1. 
The turbulent collision rate 
In the turbulent collision type, the bubbles collide due to the fluctuating nature of the 
liquid phase velocity and the collision frequency that results from the turbulent 
motion of the liquid phase is as expressed as presented Equation (4.30). 
               (ῡ    ῡ   )  
        (4.30) 
Where fi and fj are the number densities for the bubbles of size groups i and j. Sij is 
the cross-sectional area for collision of the bubbles, while ῡtj and ῡti are the average 
fluctuating velocities for the bubbles of sizes j and i respectively. Each of the 
aforementioned parameters can be expressed mathematically as shown in Equation 
(4.31) and (4.32). 
     
4            
        (4.31) 
Where rbi and rbj are the radii of the bubbles of sizes i and j respectively. The average 
turbulent fluctuating velocities can be expressed as a function of bubble size as 
follows:

ῡ    4 
 
    
 
  
        (4.32) 
4.3.1.2. 
Buoyancy-determined collision rate 
In the buoyancy collision type, the bubbles collide as a result of their different rise 
velocities and the frequency of collisions that results from difference rise velocities is 
expressed as follows: 
   
          𝑈   𝑈    
        (4.33) 
According to Clift et al., (1978), the bubble rise velocity Uri can be expressed as 
illustrated in Equation (4.34)  
𝑈  (    4𝜎
     
   5 5    )
 
 
 
        (4.34) 
4.3.1.3. 
Laminar shear collision rate 
In the laminar shear collision type, the collision of particles results from the gross 
circulation pattern that is encountered in bubbles column operating at high gas flow 
rates and is expressed mathematically as presented in Equation (4.35). 
          4
3             ( ῡ 
  ) 
        (4.35) 
4.3.2. Break up model 
Bubble break up happens when the bubble cannot withstand the internal forces or 
the external forces created by the surrounding fluid. Bubble break up can also be 
explained to occur when the bubbles collide with the turbulent eddies. The eddies 
that lead to bubble break up are those that have the length scale equal to or less 
than the bubble size (Lehr, Millies & Mewes, 2002;  Luo & Svendsen, 1996;  Prince 
& Blanch, 1990). Several breakup models have been reported in the literature and 
the breakup model by (Luo & Svendsen, 1996) is as shown (4.36).

        (4.36) 
 
Where ΩB(vi: vfBV) is the rate of breakup of a parent bubble with volume v to a 
daughter bubble of size vfVB.  
 
                                  
The other break up rate by Martìnez Bazán., (1999) is as presented in Equation 
(4.37). 
             √     
 
     
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        (4.37) 
Where the constants β=8.2 and Kg =0.25 and were found experimentally by  
Martìnez Bazán (1999) 
 The breakage function by Martìnez Bazán., (1999)  only calculates the probability 
that a parent bubble will break to yield some daughter bubbles, it does not calculate 
the size distribution of daughter bubbles, and hence a redistribution function is 
needed (Patruno et al., 2009). The redistribution function is shown in Equation 
(2.36). The total breakage rate from the two models is demonstrated in section 
(2.2.4) and the observations indicate that the model by Luo & Svendsen (1996) show 
higher breakage rates as compared to the model by Martìnez Bazán (1999). The 
model by Luo & Svendsen (1996) was therefore used as it would yield a wider size 
distribution compared to the other model which yields low breakage rates.  
 
As intimated, the right hand side of Equation (4.26) represents the death and birth of 
particles due to break-up and coalescence respectively. The total events that lead to 
birth of particles (B) due to break-up and coalescence can be expanded as shown in 
Equation (4.38). 
 

64 
 
  ∫                
 
 
    ( 
 ) ∫                         
 
 
 
       (4.38) 
 
The total events that lead to death of particles (D) as expressed in the Population 
Balance Equation can be expanded as presented in Equation (4.39). 
      
 
∫             
 
 
 ∫  
 
 
               
    (4.39) 
The expressions B and D are birth and death rates terms in the Population Balance 
Equation. When solving the PBE, the knowledge of these two terms is crucial. 
4.3.3. A solution to the Population Balance Equation 
In solving the Population Balance Equation, the initial and boundary conditions need 
to be specified. The form of Population Balance Equation adopted in the current 
study has a gas expansion term due density changes and mass transfer. The gas 
density was assumed to be constant and the mass transfer rate was calculated from 
BCM and this explains how BCM was integrated into the Population Balance 
framework. The Population Balance Equation was solved by employing the discrete 
method. In the discrete method, the particle size distribution is represented as a set 
of discrete size classes as illustrated in Figure 19.  

65

4.3.3.1. 
Initial conditions 
To solve the PBE, the initial and boundary conditions of the system must be 
specified. For the current system, the normal size distribution was adopted for the 
inlet distribution and is expressed in Equation (4.40). 
   
 
𝜎√

       (4.40) 
The mean (μ) and the variance (σ) of the population are assumed such that the 
number density probability distribution (  ) integrates to unity over the entire size 
range considered. This illustration of the intimated phenomenon is illustrated in 
Equation (4.41).

Where f is the final number density probability distribution. The latter boundary 
condition states that there are no bubbles of zero size 
4.3.3.3. 
A compartment model 
The bubble size distribution is not constant in the column due to bubble-bubble 
interaction and eddy-bubble interaction, and it is therefore vital to compartmentalise 
the column and predict size distribution at each column compartment. In doing so, it 
can be investigated and confirmed as to whether bubble size distribution varies 
along the column. In the present work, the column was compartmentalised to 
investigate the aforementioned phenomenon and also to predict the other 
hydrodynamic 
parameters 
at 
each 
compartment. 
The 
column 
was 
compartmentalized as depicted in Figure 20 and the hydrodynamics variables were 
predicted in each column compartment. The choice of initial conditions for each 
compartment is as given in Equation (4.45).

The exit bubble size distribution from the first compartment is taken as the inlet size 
distribution to the second compartment. The same methodology is applied in other 

67 
 
compartments. Thus for n compartments, the initial size distribution in each 
compartment is as given in Equation (4.46).

4.3.3.4. 
Expansion term due to density and mass transfer 
In a bubble column, the size of bubbles change with time as they rise and this 
happens when they coalesce, break up or loss of mass to the liquid phase. The 
inclusion of an expression that takes into account the loss in bubble size due to 
mass transfer into the liquid phase is crucial. The Population Balance Equation in 
(4.27) has a term that takes into account the change in bubble diameter due to 
changes in the gas density and mass transfer to the continuous phase. The 
expansion term is expressed as shown in Equation (4.47). 
             (
    
     
   
   
  
)
 
      )     
 
 
 
                    (4.47) 
With the density change with time considered as 0, the gas expansion becomes a 
function of mass transfer rate only and this is shown in Equation (4.48).

In Equation (4.48), ṅ is the molar flux, ap interfacial area, αg   is gas hold-up and μg is 
viscosity of the gas phase. The molar flux is calculated as shown in Equation (4.49).

The mass transfer coefficient (kL(u,d)) is calculated from correlating the two 
dimensionless numbers Re and Sh. The Bubble Cell Model predicts the intrinsic 
mass transfer coefficient in the vicinity of a single bubble from Re number as the 
input to the model. However, in the bubble column, there are multiple bubbles of 
different sizes, hence different Re numbers. It is therefore vital to correlate Re and 
Sh numbers in order to predict the mass transfer coefficient for bubbles of different 
Re numbers. Having correlated the two, the local mass transfer coefficient for a 
population of bubbles in the column can then be calculated using the information 
from BCM. The methodology is as shown in Equation (4.51).

Where polyfit is a built-in-function in Matlab that is used to fit data using polynomials 
and in this case it returns some coefficients for the polynomial of third degree. The 
polynomial is of the form shown in Equation (4.52).

        (4.52) 
 
At the new Re numbers for a multiple bubbles in the column, the new Sherwood 
number is calculated from the Reynolds number using the polynomial described in 
Equation (4.52). With the knowledge of the form of the polynomial that describes the 

69 
 
data from BCM, the Reynolds number for the current case can then be used to 
calculate the Sherwood number, hence the mass transfer coefficient. The following 
procedure is used to calculate the new Sherwood number. 
                       
        (4.53) 
 
Where Sh,new is the new Sherwood number calculated from the new Reynolds 
number for multiple bubbles in the column. The polyval function used is a built-in-
function in Matlab and it returns the value of the polynomial of degree 3 (in this 
present case) which is evaluated at the new Reynolds number (Re1). With the 
knowledge of Sherwood number as shown is Equation (4.53), the mass transfer 
coefficient is calculated as shown in Equation (4.54). 
         
 
 
        (4.54) 
 
The results in Figure 21  are for a flow over a single bubble and they show mass 
transfer coefficient as a function of Reynolds number as predicted from CFD.  The 
findings indicate that mass transfer coefficient increases with increasing Re number 
due to increased rates of mixing and the advection terms dominating in the Navier 
Stokes equation.  In a case where there are multiple bubbles in the column, 
polynomial interpolation is employed by correlating Sherwood number with Reynolds 
number and calculating the mass transfer coefficient for a population of bubbles as 
illustrated in Equation (4.54). The results of mass transfer coefficient for a population 
of bubbles are as shown in Figure 22. The similar trend of mass transfer coefficient 
increasing upon an increase in Re number is observed.

4.4. Numerical estimation of overall heat and mass transfer coefficients 
The Bubble Cell Model predicts the heat and mass transfer coefficients in the vicinity 
of a single bubble. In the bubble column where there is multiplicity of bubbles of 
different sizes, there is a need to predict heat and mass transfer coefficient for a 
population of bubbles and the overall heat and mass transfer coefficients thereof. 
The overall heat and mass transfer coefficients were predicted from the average 
properties as illustrated in Equation (4.55) and (4.56).

Where kL,tot is the overall mass transfer coefficient calculated from the total number 
of bubbles in the column. Multiple population balance equations were solved by 
adopting the compartment approach, and as a result the overall mass transfer 
coefficient was predicted at the discrete column compartments chosen. Upon 
predicting the overall mass transfer coefficient, the analogy between heat and mass 
transfer as discussed in section 4.2.1 was used to predict heat transfer coefficient. 
The overall heat transfer coefficient for a population of bubble in the column was 
predicted as follows: 
       ∫                    
       (4.56) 
Upon determining the overall heat and mass transfer coefficients, the total heat and 
mass transfer rates in the column can be predicted. 
4.5.Numerical stability and convergence  
In numerical methods, numerical stability and convergence are crucial for the 
accuracy of the parameters estimated. When estimating the parameters on grid 
points, it is of paramount importance to find optimum grid points where the solution is 
grid independent. The stability of the solution is achieved by the use of a fine mesh 
resolution. The grid independence was achieved by predicting the parameters at 
different grid points and changing the grid points until the predicted parameter does 
no longer change with grid size. 
4.5.1. Size range and meshing 
As specified in the above section, the inlet distribution and boundary conditions need 
to be specified. The initial bubble size used translates to the size of bubbles that are 
sparged into the column and their size depends on the diameter of the holes of the 
sparger. The choice of the initial bubble size in the present case was arbitrary as 
different spargers can have varying hole diameters. Upon choosing the initial bubble 

72 
 
size, a high resolution mesh was adopted to preserve the accuracy of the model. 
The criterion used in determining the optimum grids points was an iterative one, 
where the optimum grid points were found in a case where the solution of the 
predicted parameter converged.  This phenomenon can be observed in Figure 23 
where the predicted Nusselt number was found to be independent of grid size 
starting from 100 grid points. In the solution of the Population Balance Equation, 
bubble size distribution and some other hydrodynamic parameters are predicted at 
all the grid points considered.

4.6.  Model Consistency checks 
A model consistency check was done on the Population Balance to ensure that the 
model is consistent in its prediction. The check was done by doing a volume balance 
for the total bubbles in the column. In the column, bubbles die and some are born 
due to breakage and coalescence and mass transfer to the liquid phase contribute to 
the loss in bubble size. In the process of birth and death of bubbles and the change 
in their size, the gas flowrate needs to be conserved whereas the total gas volume 
may be different from one column compartment to another and this confirms the 
consistency of Population Balance Equation.

distribution of bubbles. The two methods were found to be in agreement for 
calculating the total gas volume in the compartment of interest.  When comparing the 
two methods, the relative difference in calculating the total volume in each 
compartment is within ±10%. 
4.7. Consistency checks on the Population Balance Model 
A total gas volume balance was performed as a necessary test that the Population 
Balance Model is consistent in its prediction of the hydrodynamic parameters. The 
volumetric flowrate from one column compartment to the next is expected to be the 
same and constant whereas the total gas volume in each compartment can be 
different as shown in Table 6. The volume balance was perfomed from one column 
compartment to another as shown in Equation (4.7.1) and the results are presented 
in Table 4 and Table 5. The observations show that in both cases, with and without 
mass transfer consideration, the volumetric flowrate is the same and constant. The 
results show that the volume balance is closed, and thus supports the accuracy of 
the Population Balance Model in the prediction of bubble size distribution.

On another set of consistency checks, the effect of resolution issues on the result 
was investigated. This was done by changing the number of discrete compartments 
and calculating the weighted mean for the bubble size distribution in each case. It is 
expected that the weighted mean will not change as the number of compartments 
are changed and this can be observed in Figure 24. The same column height was 
used (2 m), and the number of compartments was changed from 2 to 4 and the 
weighted mean is calculated as shown in Equation (4.7.2).  
    ∑    
∑ 
 
       (4.7.2)  
The findings in Figure 24 attest to the fact that the Population Balance Model is 
consistent as the weighted mean is constant and the same as the number of 
compartments are changed at constant column height, and thus the result is not 
affected by resolution issues.

4.8. Model consistency checks on total mass transfer 
A consistency check was done on the volume balance to confirm that the Population 
Balance was consistent in its prediction of bubble size distribution as outlined in 
section (4.7).  In the like manner, the consistency of the predicted mass transfer rate 
was checked by comparing the total loss in volume of the gas phase by subtracting 
the initial gas volume from final gas volume, and also from calculating total loss in 
gas volume from mass transfer coefficient. The results from the two methods are 
demonstrated in Table 7  and it can be observed that two methods are in agreement 
with average relative differece of 5.5 %

4.9. The model speed test 
The objective in the development of Bubble Cell Model is to reduce the 
computational expense that is usually encountered in the conventional modelling 
techniques. Upon completion of the model is it crucial to perform some speed tests 
to as a check that the proposed model is quicker compared to the other methods. In 
the current study, the speed of BCM was compared with VOF simulations for the 
prediction of mass transfer coefficient.

5. Results and discussion 
The objective of the study is to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics in the 
bubble column by integrating the BCM into the PBM framework. These 
characteristics include the bubble size distribution, gas hold-up, interfacial area, 
Sauter mean diameter, heat and mass transfer coefficient.  The mass transfer 
coefficient is predicted from the BCM and is a required factor for evaluation of the 
Population Balance Equation as it accounts for the loss of bubble size due to mass 
transfer. This is represented by the first term on the right hand side of Equation 
(4.27). The other parameters such as Sauter mean diameter and interfacial area are 
predicted by the Population Balance Model.

In the context of the current study, the Population Balance Model determines the 
property distribution of gas bubbles and the properties of interest are the 
aforementioned hydrodynamics variables. The overall gas hold-up, interfacial area, 
heat and mass transfer coefficient may each be determined from the size distribution 
predicted by the Population Balance Equation. Most studies report the theoretical 
and experimental determination of volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) 
(Kantarci, Borak & Ulgen, 2005). In its lumped form (intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient multiplied with specific surface area), this parameter does not allow for 

79 
 
decoupling mass transfer mechanisms. In light of this, there is a need to develop 
methods to independently determine the intrinsic liquid-phase mass transfer 
coefficient (kL) and interfacial area (ap). In the current study this separation is 
achieved, as the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient is predicted by the BCM and the 
interfacial area is predicted by the Population Balance Model. Upon determination of 
the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient in the vicinity of a single bubble from BCM, the 
information from BCM is used to determine the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient for 
multiple bubbles in the column as explained on Chapter 4. For a population of gas 
bubbles in the column, the local mass transfer coefficient refers to the mass transfer 
coefficient in the vicinity of every bubble in the column.  
The bubble-averaged mass transfer coefficient, on the other hand, which refers to 
the average mass transfer coefficient for bubbles of different sizes in the column 
space, can then be determined. The averaging is achieved through the probability 
number density distribution as illustrated in Equations 5.1 through 5.3. The 
illustration on how the local intrinsic mass transfer coefficient, global mass transfer 
coefficient, local interfacial area and global interfacial area relate to each other is 
presented in Table 8. This method can readily be applied to the area of heat transfer 
as well. Upon a successful prediction of the mass transfer coefficient, the heat 
transfer coefficient can be predicted by employing the analogy that exists between 
heat and mass transfer.

A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to investigate the influence of column 
dimensions and inlet bubble size distribution on the hydrodynamic variables and the 
results were compared with the findings in the literature. 
5.1 Spatial variation of Bubble size distribution at low Reynolds number 
The Population Balance Equation predicts property distribution of the discrete 
entities (the gas bubbles). In the current study, the properties of interest are the size 
and axial position. The results for bubble size distribution along the column at 
different compartments are presented in Figure 26. The results presented are for a 
case where low Re numbers (maximum Re=270) were used. The observations 
indicate that the bubble size distribution does not change with column height; in 
other words, as the bubbles rise at low Reynolds number, there is little breakup and 
coalescence. 
 
 

81 
 
 
Figure 26: Bubble size distribution at low Re numbers (max Re=270) 
 
From the observations in Figure 26  it is evident that at low Re values, there are 
fewer interactions between the bubbles themselves and between the bubbles and 
the continuous phase; as a result, the inlet and final size distributions are the same. 
In another case study, the inlet bubble size was increased, for which a slight 
difference was observed between the initial and final size distributions and this can 
be seen in Figure 27 through Figure 29 .This can be explained as that bigger 
bubbles increase the probability of collision due to higher rise velocities and the 
bubbles being in closer proximity with one another. In addition, for bubbles of greater 
sizes, breakage can more easily happen when they collide with liquid eddies 
because only eddy sizes smaller than the bubble diameter lead to bubble breakage. 
With coalescence and breakage effects being more notable, a wider size distribution 
is expected. The maximum Reynolds number used in Figure 27 through Figure 29 is 
7616 as opposed to the maximum Reynolds number of 270 used in Figure 26. 
5.2 Bubble size distribution at high Reynolds number 
The same axial discretisation as in Section (5.1) was applied, but in this case the 
simulations were for Re>270. In section (5.1) low Re numbers were used and this 
resulted in fewer interactions, as a result no significant changes between the inlet 
and final size distribution were observed. However, upon applying a Re number to 
above 270, a slight difference is observed between inlet and final size distribution

and the distribution at the inlet compartment continues to change from compartment 
to compartment. The Reynolds number was varied to a maximum of 7616 and the 
findings in Figure 27 indicate that the bubble size distribution in the last column 
compartment is slightly wider as compared to the inlet size distribution. A clear 
representation of the difference between the initial and the final size distributions can 
be observed in a case where the column is not compartmentalised as shown in 
Figure 28. In this case it is evident that coalescence and breakage rates were slightly 
higher, resulting in a slight difference between the final size distribution and the initial 
size distribution. The number density probability distribution of the final size 
distribution is also lower, indicating that the bubbles become fewer in number as they 
coalesced along the column. An even more distinct difference between the initial and 
final size distributions can be obtained in the case where a column height is 
increased from 2 m to 3 m. In Figure 29, where the column height used is 3 m, it can 
be observed that the final size distribution is wider and is characterised by both the 
effects of breakage and coalescence being notable.

The bubble size distribution differs slightly from one reactor compartment to another 
as observed in Figure 27, Figure 28 and Figure 29. It is expected that at the regions 
just above the sparger, the bubbles will be smaller in size and the bubble size 
distribution to be narrow. As the bubbles rise in the column, coalescence and break 
up occurs due to collision with the turbulent eddies, and the bubble size distribution 
becomes wide with increasing column height. A reduction in bubble size also occurs 
due to mass transfer from the gas-phase to the liquid phase. The loss of bubble size 
due to mass transfer is represented by the expansion term in the Population Balance

Equation. However, with coalescence occurring in parallel, the observations in 
Figure 27 indicate overall, that at regions farther from the sparger, the bubbles 
become bigger in size and fewer in number. The bubble size distribution presented 
in Figure 28 and Figure 29 show that both coalescence and break up took place as 
the final size distribution shows a wider distribution as compared to the inlet bubble 
size distribution. The results attest to the fact that for tall columns, bubble size 
distribution is wider as the bubbles have more time to coalesce and break up. 
At this stage in the development, it is possible to develop the overall mass transfer 
rate.  
5.3 Overall mass transfer rate 
In the design, scale-up and optimization of bubble columns, the rate of mass transfer 
is the primary design variable. It is therefore crucial to develop models that can 
reliably predict the mass transfer rate before unit design optimization can be 
conducted. The Bubble Cell Model was used to predict the intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient for bubbles of different sizes in the column. As the BCM predicts 
concentration gradients in the vicinity of a single bubble, the initial study consists of 
the sensitivity of the mass transfer coefficient in the vicinity of a single bubble to Re 
number with results shown in Figure 30.  As expected, the mass transfer coefficient 
increases with an increase in Re number. The increase can be attributed to 
increased mixing and the advection terms dominating in the Navier- Stokes 
equations at high Re numbers. As a result, the concentration boundary layer 
thickness decreases which according to the film theory (see Equation 4.5) will cause 
the mass transfer coefficient to increase. In addition, the increase of per-bubble 
mass transfer rate with bubble size is attributed to increased interfacial fluctuations 
and distortions. Although the bubble mass transfer coefficient has been predicted, 
there is a need to predict the overall mass transfer rate for the column as shown by 
Equation (5.3.1) .This is complicated by the hydrodynamics and the bubble geometry 
characteristics. For the overall compartment mass transfer rate, the interfacial area 
and bubble-averaged mass transfer coefficient are needed and this will be presented 
in the sections to follow. The overall compartment mass transfer rate from the 
population of bubbles in the column is presented in Table 9. The results show that 

85 
 
the overall compartment mass transfer is higher in the first compartment where the 
bubbles are smaller in size and many in number.

For a better understanding of mass transfer, it is necessary to investigate the factors 
which influence the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient such as turbulent energy 
dissipation rate, bubble slip velocity, bubble size distribution, and bubble breakup 
and coalescence (Wang, 2010). The factors investigated in the current study are 
bubble size, axial position and Re number.

5.3.1 The relationship between the bubble size, axial position and the mass transfer 
coefficient 
The rate of mass transfer in a column depends primarily on the specific interfacial 
area (a) and the intrinsic liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (kL). In the 
determination of what the mass transfer rate will be in the column, it is crucial to 
decouple (kL) from (a). This is important as it can be determined if the changes in the 
interfacial area will be greater than the changes in the intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient, and, as a result, the controlling rate in the column can be determined. 
The influence of bubble size on the mass transfer coefficient was investigated by 
changing the inlet bubble size distribution and predicting the average mass transfer 
coefficient in each case (see Equation 5.2). 
The results in Figure 31 indicate that the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient increases 
with bubble size as the bigger bubbles have higher Re number than smaller bubbles, 
and this is in agreement with published findings on the effect of bubble size on mass 
transfer coefficient (Miller, 1983).  According to this research, the mass transfer 
coefficient is dependent on mean bubble size and it increases with increasing bubble 
size. 
With respect to the mass transfer coefficient averaged over space in the vicinity of a 
bubble, the observations are that like the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient, it 
increases with an increase in bubble size as observed in Figure 32. The increase of 
mass transfer coefficient along the column height can be explained by coalescence 
being more dominant as we move to the top of the column and thus yielding large 
bubbles which have high Reynolds number. Although the mass transfer coefficient 
increases with column height due to increased bubble size, the overall mass transfer 
rate decreases due to relatively smaller interfacial area of larger bubbles as 
compared to smaller bubbles. This can be observed in Table 9 where the overall 
mass transfer rate along the column compartments is presented. 
 The smaller bubbles, which are found at the regions near the sparger tend to 
behave like rigid spheres and encounter a hindered flow in the boundary layer sense 
due to frictional drag, and, as a result, the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient is lower 
(Nedeltchev & Schumpe .,2011, Oliveira & Ni, 2004). On the other hand, the larger 
bubbles have higher rise velocities and mobile surfaces and as a result experience

significant fluid circulation and thus higher intrinsic mass transfer coefficient. The 
findings in the current study are consistent to the work of Nedeltchev & Schumpe 
(2011) and Oliveira & Ni (2004) as observed in Figure 31 and Figure 32. 
The local mass transfer coefficient in the vicinity of individual bubbles is presented in 
Figure 33 and the same trends as for the bubble average and intrinsic mass transfer 
coefficient are observed. The results presented in Figure 33 are for the individual 
bubbles in the first column compartment.

5.4 Sensitivity analysis 
A sensitivity analysis is performed by investigating the system response to changes 
in model parameters.  It is important in that it gives an insight into the relevance of 
including certain phenomena to the model. The sensitivity analysis establishes the 
operating regions associated with specific behaviour patterns and allows for an 
understanding of the system dynamics.  In the current study, the parameters of 
interest include column dimensions and inlet bubble size distribution. In each 
sensitivity analysis carried out, the results were compared with the findings from the 
literature. 
5.4.1 The influence of column dimensions on gas hold-up 
The accurate prediction of gas hold-up is of paramount importance due to its 
significant influence on the performance of bubble columns. It is asserted that it 
indirectly governs the liquid phase flow, and ultimately the rates of mixing, heat and 
mass transfer (Wu, Cheng Ong & Al-Dahhan, 2001). In the absence of liquid 
recirculation, gas hold-up is directly proportional to residence time. In terms of 
column operation, a high level of gas hold-up results in greater gas-liquid contact. In 
the current study, gas hold-up was predicted by the Population Balance Equation 
using bubble size distribution as illustrated in Equation 2.4.

The influence of column dimension on gas hold-up was investigated by varying the 
column diameter or column height and reporting the findings in each case. By 
changing the column diameter, the gas hold-up in each chosen reactor compartment 
was found to remain constant.  As illustrated in Table 10, the constant gas hold-up 
upon changing the column diameter can be attributed to the constant bubble 
residence time in the absence of liquid recirculation. In the absence of liquid 
recirculation, the terminal velocity can be directly related to residence time; hence 
bigger bubbles are expected to have smaller gas hold up due to their high rise 
velocities. In addition, the coalescence and break-up models show a dependence on 
the column geometry; physically, the cross-sectional area relates to the probability 
that bubbles will collide, the column dimensions therefore influence the frequency of 
the events. In spite of the aforementioned criterion, it is the column height that shows 
the strong influence on gas hold-up as shown in Table 11, whilst the change in the 
column diameter does not result in the change in gas hold-up. 
The observations in Table 11 show that the gas hold-up increases upon increasing 
the column height. The increase in gas hold-up can be attributed to longer residence 
times in tall columns and in the absence of liquid recirculation (which is the case in 
the current study), gas hold-up is directly proportional to the residence time. Seeing 
that the gas hold-up is sensitive to these values of column height, an exaggerated 
column height of 20 m was attempted to investigate further the influence of column 
height; in this region gas hold-up does indeed become a strong function of column 
height due to the increased time of exposure of the bubbles to breakup and 
coalescence phenomena and also due to an increased bubble residence time. The 
influence of the axial position (at fixed column height) on gas hold-up was also 
investigated and the findings are as shown in Table 11. The observations indicate 
that gas hold-up decreases with an increase in axial position, as observed in Table 
11 that it decreases from one compartment to another. This can be explained by the 
decrease in bubble residence time as they rise through the column from one 
compartment to the next, due to their sizes becoming bigger as a result of 
coalescence. 
On the study of the effect of aspect ratio on gas hold-up, Daly et al. (1992) found that 
gas hold up is independent on column height, whilst column diameter results in some 
changes in gas hold up. They found that gas hold up in a small diameter column was 

90 
 
slightly higher than that in a larger diameter column. Their findings are counter 
intuitive as it is expected that gas hold-up will increase with an increase in column 
volume. On the other study, Shah et al. (1982) reported that the effect of column size 
on gas hold up is negligible for column diameters larger than 10-15 cm. The findings 
in the study of Luo et al. (1999)  indicate that the effect of column height on gas hold-
up is insignificant for a column height above 1-3 m and an aspect ratio larger than 5. 
These findings in the work of Luo et al. (1999)   are different from the findings in the 
current study where gas hold-up was found to be dependent on column height even 
for column heights above 1-3 m as presented in Table 11 . In addition, there is a 
difference to the findings of Luo et al. (1999), in that, gas hold-up was found to be 
dependent on column dimensions even for an aspect ratio of greater than 5 and 
column diameters larger than 10-15 cm. The findings of gas hold-up being constant 
upon changing the column diameter, are not in agreement with the study of Daly et 
al. (1992). The reason for this is that in the current study, liquid recirculation was not 
taken into account, and thus the rise velocity of bubbles was directly related to their 
residence time.

5.4.2 The influence of inlet bubble size on the predicted gas hold up 
The other parameter that was used to investigate its impact on gas hold-up is the 
initial size of the bubbles sparged into the column. The bubble size was increased by 
changing the inlet size of bubbles in the column and upon changing the inlet size, the 
same rate of bubbles goes into the column and if they are bigger, the volume of the 
gas becomes bigger. Although the volume of gas is greater when bigger bubbles are 
used, it passes through the column so much faster, and the overall gas hold-up 
becomes lower. The findings indicate that gas hold-up increases with the decrease 
in the initial size of the bubbles sparged into the column as shown in Table 12. This 
can be explained by the fact that larger bubbles rise more rapidly than smaller, thus 
the fraction of the volume occupied by gas decreases in the reactor as the bubbles 
rise quickly to the top of the column in the absence of liquid recirculation. The area 
available for mass transfer decreases as the bubble size increases, and this is not 
desirable as the objective is to achieve high rates of mass transfer. It is therefore 
crucial that spargers with small hole diameters are used, as this will aid in achieving 
high gas-liquid interfacial area, and ultimately high rates of mass transfer. 
According to the research of Shimizu et al. (2000), bubble size distribution is 
intricately related to the bubble residence time, the bubble rise velocity and gas hold-
up. The bubbles of a greater size have a higher rise velocity and thus a lower gas 
hold-up and this is in agreement with the findings of the current study as mentioned 
above.

5.4.3 The influence of column diameter on predicted gas-liquid interfacial area and the 
number of bubbles 
The gas-liquid interfacial area varies along the column height due to differences in 
bubble sizes. At the regions above the sparger, the size of bubbles closely resemble 
the bubbles from the sparger and are still small in size and have a narrow size 
distribution as expected. As the bubbles move further from the sparger region, their 
sizes and number change as they interact with each other and with the liquid eddies, 
thus a difference in gas-liquid interfacial area in each region is expected. The gas-
liquid interfacial area decreases with increasing column height due to bubbles 
becoming greater in size as they move along the column. At the bottom, the bubbles 
are fairly localised near the sparger and all are rising in one direction (vertically); as 
they rise there is more radial movement since the fluid above the sparger tends to be 
more strongly mixed. This radial movement allows for more collision higher into the 
column. 
The impact of aspect ratio on gas-liquid interfacial area was investigated, and the 
findings indicate that with increased column diameter, the gas-liquid interfacial area 
available for mass transfer is slightly increased as observed in Table 13. This 
increase could be explained by the fact that at increased column diameter, there is 
less bubble-bubble collision which results in small bubbles and thus increased 
surface to volume ratio. The increase in the number of bubbles with an increase with 
column diameter as illustrated in Table 15 also attests to less bubble-bubble 

93 
 
collisions in a larger column diameter. The presence of many bubbles in a larger 
column diameter can be attributed to the prevalence of liquid recirculation and 
turbulence, which in turn results in many bubbles which are smaller in size. On the 
contrary, for a small column diameter, a slug flow regime is encountered and this 
results in bigger bubbles being dominant and thus fewer in number as the results in 
Table 15 indicate. It can also be concluded that the rate of coalescence is greater 
than that of break up in the case of a small diameter column and this is manifested 
by the presence of fewer bubbles. In a wider diameter column, the presence of many 
bubbles can be explained by the more lateral space which minimises the chances of 
collision and coalescence.  
The increase of aspect ratio by changing the column height shows a more significant 
change as compared to changing the column diameter. This can be observed in 
Table 14 where the findings show interfacial area to decrease as the column height 
is increased. The explanation lies in the fact that for tall columns, there is more 
contact time between the bubbles which enhances coalescence hence reduced 
interfacial area. The change in column height shows that, although there are some 
observed changes in interfacial area, the interfacial area is not a strong function of 
column height. In view of that, an exaggerated column height of 20 m was attempted 
and at this height the observations show that the interfacial area has a strong 
dependence on column height.

5.4.4 The influence of the expansion term on the predicted mean diameter 
The inclusion of the expansion term in the Population Balance Equation, takes into 
account the reduction of bubble size due to mass transfer into the liquid phase. It is 
therefore expected that the exclusion of this term will result in the predicted bubble 
size being larger than when it is included. In the current study, the findings in 
excluding the expansion term indicate that the mean bubble size in each reactor 
compartment is slightly bigger than when the term is included as observed in Table 
16. It was observed that the exclusion of the expansion term results in the same 
bubble size distribution to when it is included and this observation is illustrated in 
Figure 34 and Figure 35. The sensitivity to the inclusion of this effect is negligible. 
The difference between the Sauter mean diameters predicted in each case is 
insignificant, and this can be attributed to the low rates of mass transfer due to poor 

95 
 
mixing at low Re numbers as it was in this case. Although the effect of mass transfer 
on the predicted bubble size is insignificant, in the current model it was included as 
its effect would be more notable at higher Re numbers.

5.5 Predicting heat transfer coefficients  
The overall Heat transfer coefficient was predicted from mass transfer results by 
applying the analogy between heat and mass transfer as explained in section (2.1.8). 
The accuracy of the analogy in predicting the intrinsic heat transfer coefficient was 
benchmarked by comparing the heat transfer coefficient predicted from CFD and the 
one predicted from heat and mass analogy.  Close agreement is found as shown in 
Figure 18. The heat transfer coefficient in each column compartment was 
determined by averaging heat transfer coefficient results from all the bubbles in that 
respective compartment. The averaging was perfomed using the number density 
probability distribution and heat transfer coefficient for all bubbles in the 
compartment and it was calculated as shown in Equation (5.5.1). 
   ∫                 
     (5.5.1) 
As intimated above, the heat transfer coefficient for a population of bubbles in the 
column was determined and the results are shown in Figure 36. The findings indicate 
that with an increase in bubble size, the predicted heat transfer coefficient

decreases. This is attributed to the bubbles being bigger in size but few in number; 
as a result there is less transfer area. 
 
 The results in Figure 36 are in agreement with the results on heat transfer 
coefficient reported by Mortuza et al. (2011). They reported that heat transfer 
coefficient is larger for smaller bubbles due to increased surface to volume ratio. 
However, in some other studies it was reported that heat transfer coefficient 
increases with an increase in bubble size due to larger wakes and stronger vortices 
associated with bigger bubbles (Li & Prakasha, 1997). They reported that with bigger 
bubbles heat transfer is enhanced due to induced turbulence that results in faster 
surface renewal. 
 
 
Figure 36: The effect of bubble size on heat transfer coefficient 
The results in Figure 37 and Figure 38 are a representation of heat transfer 
coefficient in two case studies. The observations show that for a case where big 
bubbles are chosen as the initial bubble size, the average heat transfer coefficient is 
greater as opposed to a case where smaller bubbles are used.

5.6.1 Validating gas hold-up 
The model results on gas hold-up were validated against correlations reported in the 
literature. There are several correlations for the prediction of gas hold-up and of the 
ones chosen for model validation, it can be seen from Figure 39 that the correlations 
by Reilly et.al (1986) and Kelkar et.al (1983) show a good agreement to the model 
results. We note that these correlations were chosen for comparison with model 
results since they involve the same basic chemicals (air and water). Equations 5.3-
5.5 are the mathematical expressions for the correlations of gas hold-up used for 
model validation. The predicted values for gas hold-up are very close to the 
correlations in the literature as illustrated in  Figure 39.

5.8.2 Validating interfacial area 
The specific interfacial area available for mass transfer was also validated using 
correlations reported in the literature. The correlation used in validating interfacial 
area is by Serizawa & Kataoka,. (1989). The correlation was used because it was 
derived for an air-water system and the current work is focusing on the same 
system. The results in Table 17 show that there is a 29 % discrepancy between the 
model results and the results calculated from the interfacial area correlation.  
However, upon decreasing the inlet bubble size as shown in Table 18, the findings 
indicate that there is a close agreement between the model results and the results 
predicted from the correlation. The explanation for the model results yielding a close 
agreement to the correlations at certain operating conditions can be ascribed to the 
accuracy of the correlations which is only maintained under the conditions in which 
they were derived. The correlation against which the model was validated has the 
mathematical formulation presented in Equation 5.6.

The validation of interfacial area demonstrated in Table 17 is for bubble sizes

Since interfacial area and gas hold-up have been validated against correlations, the 
Sauter mean diameter was not validated because gas hold-up was calculated from 
interfacial area and Sauter mean diameter as follows: 
       
 
 
        (5.7) 
Therefore a close agreement between the interfacial area and gas hold-up results 
with the results calculated from the correlations, gives surety that the predicted mean 
diameter is accurate as well. 
5.8.3. Validating heat transfer coefficient  
The heat transfer coefficient predicted from the heat and mass analogy was 
validated against heat transfer coefficient  correlations reported in the literature. The

5.8.4 Validating mass transfer results 
 
As outlined in the previous sections, mass transfer from the dispersed to the 
continous phase was predicted from the Bubble Cell Model and the accuracy of the 
results predicted was tested against the experimental data by the use of reported 
correlations as presented in Table 20. The predicted mass transfer rate was 
validated against the mass transfer rate predicted from the correlation by Ranz 
&Marshal, (1952) and  a close agreement was achieved with an average relative 
error of ±6 %. Some other correlations showed a pronounced departure from the 
model and the explanation lies in the fact the emperical correlations are limited in 
their prediction as they are accurate under the conditions in which they were derived, 
and depend also in other parameters like equipment type and geometry.  The 
fundamental model was used in the current study and experiments were not needed.

5.9 Model speed test 
A speed test was performed to evaluate whether the current model is quicker as 
compared to other models. Using MATLAB 2011, it took 15.82 seconds for the 
current model to predict the parameters of interest by integration of BCM into the 
PBM framework. When using the same grid points in CFD to get the converged 
numerical solutions for the prediction of mass transfer coefficient, it took 1.46 
minutes. It could therefore be seen that the integration of BCM into the PBM 
framework is extremely fast compared to some conventional CFD modelling 
techniques. In addition, good predictions were also achieved as seen from 
comparing the model results with empirical correlations. 
5.10 Summary 
The model gives accurate predictions at higher speeds than the existing models. 
However, it is limited to low Re numbers; to become more general, the BCM itself 
must be developed to account for the change in bubble shape, and that is beyond 
the scope of the present study. However, even the result from the present study is 
significant since it takes any general bubble column simulation and, for the regions 
where the Re value is low, this method can be applied to speed up the calculation for 
that fraction of the fluid

6. Concluding remarks 
A model for predicting hydrodynamic variables in a bubble column was developed by 
integrating the BCM into the PBM framework. The Bubble Cell Model has the ability 
to rapidly predict velocity gradients (Coetzee et al., 2011), heat and mass transfer 
coefficients, and has an advantage that in its predictive ability, it does not depend on 
operating conditions and equipment type. The integration of BCM into the Population 
Balance framework is therefore a fundamental approach as the BCM is generic in its 
predictive nature.  
The limitation in the application of BCM is the range of Re numbers used (maximum 
Re number being 270). At low Reynolds numbers the bubble size distribution along 
the column does not change due to the absence of bubble-bubble interaction and 
eddy-bubble interaction, rendering Population Balances superfluous. However, at 
high Re numbers there is increased interaction between the dispersed and the 
continuous phase and bubble size distribution varies along the column, thus the 
Population Balance Equation needs to be employed. The current work aimed at 
integrating the BCM into the PBM framework, and BCM in its current development 
can only be employed to a maximum Re number of 270, and at these Re numbers 
the bubble size distribution does not change along the column height as shown in 
section 5. It is therefore vital to extend BCM to high Re numbers as in its current 
development, its integration into the PBM framework does not achieve the intended 
purpose since at low Re numbers there is no significant difference between the initial 
and final size distributions. The current work therefore focusses on answering 
whether it is worth the intellectual investment to develop extensions to the BCM for 
higher Re values. To answer this question, in the regions where BCM does yield 
accurate answers, the computational expense was benchmarked against the 
traditional CFD approaches. 
The predicted hydrodynamic variables are mass and heat transfer coefficients, gas 
hold-up, interfacial area and Sauter mean diameter. The predicted hydrodynamic 
variables were validated against correlations and a good agreement was found 

105 
 
between the results predicted from the model and the correlations. The predicted 
parameters showed a close agreement with the correlations with overall gas hold-up 
having an error of ±0.6 %, interfacial area ±3.36 % and heat transfer coefficient 
±15.4 %. On the computational expense, a speed test was performed to evaluate 
whether the current model is quicker as compared to other models. Using MATLAB 
2011, it took 15.82 seconds for the current model to predict the parameters of 
interest by integration of BCM into the PBM framework. When using the same grid 
points in CFD to get the converged numerical solutions for the prediction of mass 
transfer coefficient, it took 1.46 minutes. It could therefore be concluded that the 
integration of BCM into the PBM framework is extremely fast compared to some 
conventional CFD modelling techniques 
In addition, this approach allowed for deconvolution of the interfacial area and mass 
transfer coefficient, thereby advancing the understanding of the mass transfer 
mechanisms and also enabling determination of the controlling rate in the column. 
The aforementioned parameters were predicted separately as the volumetric mass 
transfer coefficient which is normally used in mass transfer predictions, does not 
allow for the decoupling of mass transfer mechanisms .The findings in the current 
study indicate that interfacial area controls the rate of mass transfer as intimated in 
section 5. On the other hand, the findings indicate that gas hold-up is bigger for small 
bubbles as they rise slowly in the column compared to the bigger bubbles. The 
current study did not take into account liquid recirculation in the column, thus bubble 
residence time was directly related to bubble rise velocity, and hence low gas hold-
ups were found for high bubble rise velocities. 
On the investigation of the influence of column dimensions on the predicted 
hydrodynamics, the small diameter column resulted in bigger bubble sizes due to the 
slug flow that is encountered. In a small diameter column, the mass transfer rates 
are low due to decreased interfacial area. However, in the current study the column 
diameter was found to not be a strong function of the hydrodynamics parameters as 
observed in section 5. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic variables change with the 
column height. For instance, upon increasing the column diameter, the mean bubble 
size was found to increase as well, thus decreasing gas hold-up as mentioned 
earlier. 

106 
 
The heat transfer coefficient was predicted from mass transfer coefficient results 
using the analogy that exists in the mathematical formulation of the two parameters, 
and the predicted heat transfer coefficient was validated against correlations and 
was found to be in good agreement. It is important to note that though the predicted 
hydrodynamic parameters showed a good agreement to the results predicted from 
the correlations, this can only be achieved at certain operating conditions. Upon 
changing the operating conditions such as Re number, column diameter or height 
and the superficial gas velocity, there is an observed deviation between model 
results and those predicted from correlations. The deviation can be attributed to the 
limitation of correlations as they can only yield accurate results under conditions in 
which they were derived, beyond those operating conditions their accuracy can no 
longer be maintained. 
From the intimated observations, it can be concluded that due to the savings on 
computational expense at low Re values, it would be worth the intellectual expense 
to extend BCM to higher Re values.  Although BCM is limited to low Re values, the 
result from the present study is significant since it takes any general bubble column 
simulation and, for the regions where the Re value is low, this method can be applied 
to speed up the calculation for that fraction of the fluid. The additional advantages 
are that the intrinsic mass coefficient and specific interfacial area calculated allowing 
for more detailed designs. In addition, the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient and the 
specific interfacial area were determined independently and that allows for the 
decoupling of mass transfer mechanisms. 
6.1. Recommendations 
Bubble Cell Model predicts the velocity, temperature and concentration fields in the 
vicinity of a single bubble and it is extremely fast in its predictive capability. On the 
other hand, the Population Balance Model predicts the distribution of discrete 
entities.  Since the BCM predicts the aforementioned parameters in the vicinity of a 
single bubble, the information from the BCM was used to calculate the distribution of 
the parameters for a population of bubbles in the column. This was done by 
integrating BCM into the Population Balance framework. There is a limitation in the 
use of BCM since it can only be employed to maximum Re number of 270 and it was 
observed in the current study that in this range of Re numbers, size distribution does 

107 
 
not change along the column and the integration of BCM into the Population Balance 
framework is not necessary. However, upon increasing Re numbers, bubble size 
distribution along the column changes and it is at these high Re numbers that the 
integration of BCM into the Population Balance framework is essential. Therefore the 
extension of BCM to high Re number is crucial. The other extension to the BCM-
PBM application can be the studying of reactive systems. 
In the current study, the bubble residence time was directly related to bubble rise 
velocity as liquid recirculation was not considered. The model prediction can be 
improved by considering liquid recirculation and the different angles at which bubbles 
rise in the column, and thus velocity distribution can be modelled from BCM-PBM 
approach.  The bubble rise velocity is a function of bubble size and PBM has the 
ability to predict bubble size, thus knowing bubble size as a function of position and 
time, the velocity distribution can be calculated from macroscopic force balance.

Appendix B: Derivation of the heat transfer coefficient equation   
Heat-transfer rate between the surface and the fluid is written as follows; 
 
                   
 
 
 
 
 
(C.1) 
At the surface, heat transfer is by conduction and is expressed as follows: 
 
 
     (
 
  )               
 
 
 
(C.2)
