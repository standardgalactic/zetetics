Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the Scandinavian Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of Kinnekulle in southwestern Sweden. 
The above-mentioned periods in the study area are poorly understood and the archaeological record consists of a few stray 
finds and a concentration of 20 gallery graves. This study focuses on three of the gallery graves where commingled skeletons 
from successive burials were recovered. The human remains and the artefacts from the graves were used for discussing 
individual life stories as well as living societies with the aim of gaining new knowledge of the last part of the Neolithic and 
the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in southwestern Sweden. We focused on questions concerning health and trauma, 
mobility and exchange networks, and diet and subsistence of the people using the graves. Chronological, bioarchaeological, 
and biomolecular aspects of the burials were approached through the application of archaeological and osteological stud-
ies, as well as stable isotope, strontium isotope, radiocarbon, and mtDNA analyses. The study provides evidence for high 
mobility and diverse diets, as well as inhumations primarily dated to the transition between the Late Neolithic and Early 
Bronze Age. We suggest that the mountain plateau of Kinnekulle was mainly reserved for the dead, while the people lived 
in agriculture-based groups in the surrounding lower lying regions.

Introduction
The Scandinavian Late Neolithic (LN: ca. 2200–1700 
BC) and Early Bronze Age (EBA: ca. 1700–1100 BC) are 
often described as a time of major socioeconomic trans-
formations, characterized by increased social complexity, 
growing population density, complex bifacial flint-working 
techniques, the continued development of long-house con-
struction, the construction and use of gallery graves, intensi-
fied import of gold and copper artefacts, and a stronger reli-
ance on agriculture compared to the Middle Neolithic (MN: 
ca. 3300–2200 BC, Apel 2001; Artursson 2009; Kristiansen 
and Larsson 2005; Simonsen 2017; Vandkilde 1996). In 
the Nordic context, most research has concentrated on the 
Danish isles and Scania in southern Sweden (e.g. Arturs-
son 2009; Bergerbrant et al. 2017; Ebbesen 2007; Frei 
et al. 2019; Frei et al. 2015; Kristiansen and Larsson 2005; 
Simonsen 2017; Skoglund 2005; Tornberg 2018; Vandkilde 
1996), although eastern and central Sweden have also been

studied (Apel 2001; Eriksson et al. 2008; Fraser 2018). The 
LN and EBA in inland southwestern Sweden are less inten-
sively studied (Weiler 1994) and rarely included in the dis-
cussions of the suggested social changes. Nevertheless, in 
recent investigations (Blank 2019, 2021; Blank et al. 2018a, 
2020, 2021), new data from the megalithic population of 
Falbygden, inland southwestern Sweden demonstrate that 
major changes occurred during the LN and EBA involving 
a distinct increase in human mobility and genetic diversity, 
as well as more varied agro-pastoral subsistence practices 
in comparison to the MN period. By further investigating 
this inland region, being outside the core geographical area 
of LN-EBA research, our study provides a widened under-
standing of LN-EBA societies.
In the archaeological record from the LN and EBA, the 
inland of southwestern Sweden stands out from the general 
picture of south Scandinavia. Some of the differences, such 
as the few LN flat graves and long houses, may be a con-
sequence of the low number of large-scale excavations in 
the area. However, the large LN gallery graves as well as 
the relatively low profiled Bronze Age cairns in this area 
compared to the small gallery graves and large BA mounds 
in Denmark and Scania can be assigned to regional variation 
(Blank 2021; Weiler 1994).
In inland southwestern Sweden, archaeological remains 
from settlements are poorly known and most of the exca-
vated graves from the LN and EBA are collective graves 
with successive burials containing commingled and frag-
mented skeletons (Blank 2021; Weiler 1994). In these cases, 
the conventional archaeological methods are limited and the 
conditions for osteological studies are challenging. However, 
by including bioarcheological methods, we can gain new 
knowledge about the individuals buried in these graves and 
make assumptions about the LN and EBA populations and 
social development in the area.
This study focuses on Kinnekulle, immediately south 
of lake Vänern in the region of Västergötland (VG, Fig. 1). 
Kinnekulle is a plateau mountain with sedimentary layers 
covered by diabase and surrounded by much older bedrock. 
The limestone rich area provides good conditions for bone 
preservation and the geological differences between Kin-
nekulle and the surrounding regions make it an ideal setting 
for mobility studies based on strontium (Sr) isotopes.
The aim of this study is to investigate human mobility 
and dietary patterns of LN and EBA individuals buried at 
Kinnekulle. The investigation is based on interdisciplinary 
analyses of the remains from 18 humans and analyses of 
artefacts recovered in three gallery graves (Supplementary 
Information, SI 1 and 2). The graves represent typical south-
western Swedish gallery graves, characterized by port-holes, 
ante-chambers, and rather large sizes of about 5 to 14 m.
We investigate health and dietary patterns and dis-
cuss subsistence strategies by combining osteological 
investigations, bioarcheological data, and nitrogen and car-
bon isotope analysis. The Sr isotope data and the artefacts 
within the graves provide information on possible settlement 
patterns, landuse, and human movements. The radiocarbon 
dates in combination with the artefacts enable us to estimate 
the use time of the graves. Furthermore, we compare our 
results to data from previously analysed megalithic popula-
tions from Falbygden (Blank 2021).
Kinnekulle
Geology and Sr isotope baseline data
Most of southwestern Sweden consists of Precambrian crys-
talline rocks from the Early and Middle Proterozoic eras 
(Andersson et al. 1999; Larsson and Tullborg 2015). The 
7×13 km large Kinnekulle on the other hand is one of three 
areas within inland southwestern Sweden characterized by 
Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks (Fig. 1). These rocks once 
covered large areas, of which now only some areas remain 
due to diabase caps protecting them from the glacial ice. The 
sediments include Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian alum 
shale, limestone, and slate, on top of sandstone deposited 
during the lower Cambrian (Larsson and Tullborg 2015).
A recent baseline study (Blank et al. 2018b) confirmed 
that the isotopic composition of the bioavailable Sr more or 
less mirrors the basement geology of the area, with higher 
ratios in the Precambrian terrains and lower ratios in the 
Palaeozoic sedimentary areas. According to this study, the 
local 87Sr/86Sr range of Kinnekulle was estimated to be 0.714 
to 0.719, including 100% of the observations. This range is 
based on eight reference samples of spring and creek water 
from different locations on various lithologies within Kin-
nekulle (Blank et al. 2018b). The baseline of Kinnekulle 
is distinctly different from the Sr isotope ranges in the sur-
rounding areas, although there are some overlaps with other 
sedimentary regions (see “Method”).
The archaeological record
The archaeology of the area is poorly known and is mainly 
based on stray finds and a few graves. The stray finds dat-
ing to the LN and earlier are concentrated to the periphery 
and surroundings of Kinnekulle, while the sedimentary area 
seems rather empty of these artefacts (Blomqvist/Bägerfeldt 
1990). Furthermore, Kinnekulle is relatively empty also 
of EBA stray finds compared with the surrounding areas 
(Weiler 1994: 45, 96). In the southeastern margin of Kin-
nekulle, the largest rock carving site in inland southwestern 
Sweden (Flyhov) is found, with several panels and about 400 
figures (Ekhoff 1892; Fig. 2). The rock art displays many 
similarities to carvings recovered at the west coast, with for

example ax-bearing figures and figures with wings, crooked 
beaks, and swords (Weiler 1994: 92). Several of the carv-
ings can be dated to the EBA. Close by, several rock art sites 
consisting of cup marks and foot soles are recorded.
The most prominent prehistoric remains at Kinnekulle 
are the 20 gallery graves concentrated to the 55 square km 
large area (Fig. 2). The gallery graves are located on the 
limestone plateau about 150 masl. They form five groups 
of equally sized gallery graves (Weiler 1994: 81). The few 
stray finds consisting of ca. ten flint daggers and shaft-hole 
axes may be remnants from destroyed gallery graves. 
Unlike in Falbygden, the largest sedimentary area in inland 
southwestern Sweden, no megalithic or flat graves dated to 
the Early or Middle Neolithic periods are so far known at 
Kinnekulle.
The three gallery graves included in this study are located 
on the limestone plateau: Medelplana 18 in the western part 
about 3 km from lake Vänern, Medelplana 54 in the northern 
part ca. 2 km from lake Vänern, and Österplana 27 in the 
eastern part ca. 5 km from lake Vänern (Fig. 2).

Site descriptions
Medelplana 54, Helles gallery grave
  In 1916, Schnittger (1920) excavated and removed this gallery 
grave. It was 7.3×2.5 m large and constructed below ground. 
The grave had slightly curved long sides, similar to the Danish 
Bøstrup cists and oriented NW- SE, with an ante-chamber in 
the northwestern part. The walls were constructed by double 
limestone slabs. The two limestone slabs separating the cham-
ber and ante-chamber were cut into a vague port-hole (Fig. 3).
During the excavation, Schnittger (1920) estimated 
the human remains belonging to about 60 individuals. A 
more recent osteological investigation concluded that the 
minimum number of individuals of the recovered skeletal 
remains was 20 (Tornberg 2018). The discrepancy can be 
explained by several factors: an osteologist did not make the 
first estimation, human remains might have been left at the 
site, and bones could have been lost.
Österplana 27, Högebo gallery grave
 Nyström (1886) excavated and removed this gallery grave. 
It was recovered below ground and consisted of a 4×1.4 m 
large rectangular grave constructed by limestone slabs. The 
grave was divided by a slab with a circular port-hole into a

chamber and an open ante-chamber in the west-southwestern 
end (Fig. 4; Nyström 1886; Sahlström 1915:81).
According to Nyström (1886), skeletal remains from about 
50 individuals were found and the partially articulated skeletons 
were well preserved and placed in sitting positions against the 
chamber walls. Nevertheless, in his drawing (Fig. 4), the skel-
etons are placed in supine positions. The illustration cannot be 
considered to depict an accurate placement of the bones and 
the description of the sitting position may as well be interpreted 
as bodies put in a contracted arrangement. Only 25 skulls are 
stored at the depository at SHM, from this grave.
Medelplana 18, Karlsgården
 In 1865, this gallery grave was excavated and removed 
(Montelius 1905). It was found below ground underneath 
a small mound surrounded by kerb stones. The grave was 
3.3×1.8 m large, oriented N-S, and consisted of a rectangu-
lar chamber constructed by four limestone slabs and a short 
passage narrower than the chamber built with two limestone 
slabs. In the slab dividing the chamber and the passage, a 
half-circular port-hole was observed (Fig. 5). These types of 
port-holes are not so common in Västergötland but appear 
in several gallery graves in the coastal regions of Bohuslän 
and Halland (Montelius 1905). Inside the chamber, parallel 
to the long side, a slab formed a niche, which was partially 
covered by a roof slab (Fig. 5).
Most of the skeletons were reburied in the chamber after 
the excavation. However, a femur, a piece of a mandible, and 
a loose molar tooth were collected and preserved.
Material
The recovered artefacts were studied at the Swedish National 
Historical Museum (SHM) depository, and the documen-
tation of the graves were retrieved from the Antiquarian-
Topographic archive (antikvarisk-topografiska arkivet/ATA) 
along with supplementary information found in Montelius 
1905 and Sahlström 1915. The artefacts were typologically 
dated, and details of the finds and material were registered. 
We also sampled skeletal remains from the SHM depository 
at Tumba (see below).
Sampling strategy and selection criteria
We sampled the three gallery graves from Kinnekulle where 
human bones were collected during excavations. Our strat-
egy was to sample as many unique individuals as possible 
where both enamel and bone for collagen was available. We 
therefore adjusted the sampling in the specific graves accord-
ing to the availability of different parts of jawbones with

teeth in situ from the commingled and fragmented skeletal 
remains. Of the material from the Medelplana 54 and Öster-
plana 27 graves, we sampled teeth in mandibles from unique 
individuals, while a single loose tooth was analysed from 
the Medelplana 18 grave. The teeth were primarily targeted 
to be able to include a variation of isotope and biochemi-
cal analyses with only minimal destruction of the human 
remains. In three cases, mandible bones were sampled for 
radiocarbon dating and stable isotope as the tooth was used 
for aDNA and Sr isotope analysis (SI 1). Of the Medelplana 
54 and Österplana 27 graves, when possible, we sampled 
two or three molars from the same individual to be able to 
detect possible movements during childhood and early ado-
lescence. Only three individuals were sampled from Öster-
plana 27, as we only were allowed to sample teeth or loose 
bones from the skulls.
We sampled the enamel in bulk instead of measuring it on 
a micro scale, as this technique was not available for us at the 
moment of sampling. Enamel mineralization may take sev-
eral years, which means that the measured Sr isotope ratios 
of our bulk samples represent an average of the Sr which has 
been incorporated during this process (Montgomery 2010: 
330). We included first (1), second (2), and third (3) molars, 
with crown formations spanning from 0 to 3 years in M1s, 
2.5–8 years in M2s, and 7–16 years in M3s (Nelson and Ash 
2010: 31). Second molars were prioritized over third molars, 
where enamel forms later and over a longer time. In turn, 
isotope ratios in first molars may be affected by weaning 
(Fuller et al. 2003).
The isotope ratios in different bone elements represent 
different ages of the individuals, as the rate of chemical 
and structural turnover varies. Tooth dentine, as well as the 
petrous bone (part of the temporal bone), is inert and the 
isotopic signals thus originate from childhood, although the 
second and third molars may also reflect the youth (Ubelaker 
1989). The roots of the teeth were sampled, which should 
indicate the average diet over several years. The collagen in 
other bone elements reflects an average of several years of 
diet prior to death, due to the rate of turnover. In most cases, 
dentine was sampled for radiocarbon dating, δ13C and δ15N 
isotopes (SI 1).
Overview of samples
We sampled 18 individuals from inhumation burials for 
nitrogen, carbon, and strontium isotopes. Teeth, mostly 
molars, were sampled to maximize the number of analy-
ses and minimize the destruction of material. Thus, the 
results reflect the childhood/youth (the root formation 
and the enamel crystallization) of the individuals. Most 
of the sampled individuals were found in Medelplana 54 
(Table 1). In 11 cases, several teeth of the same individual, 
representing different ages, were sampled for Sr isotope 
analysis (three individuals from Österplana 27 and eight 
from Medelplana 54). In addition, we sampled tooth roots 
from 17 of these individuals for ancient DNA analyses 
(aDNA). The radiocarbon dates of all sampled individu-
als were published in previous studies (Blank et al. 2020; 
Fibiger et al. 2013) and recalibrated and modelled in this 
study (see method).
Method
Osteology
Sex, age, and paleopathology of adults and non-adults were 
registered using a standard analytical protocol, when appli-
cable (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). Considering the com-
mingling of the skeletons, the remains could not be assessed 
to specific individuals. A minimum number of individuals 
(MNI) approach was used to estimate the number of indi-
viduals inhumed in the graves. MNI was calculated by the 
skeletal element (MNE) count with the highest frequency 
in each context. Side, age, and sex were considered in the 
estimation. For further information about the osteological 
registration process, see SI 2.

Strontium isotopes
Sr isotope analysis has become an established method for 
studying human and animal mobility (e.g. Frei et al. 2015, 
2019; Gron et al. 2016; Knipper 2011; Knipper et al. 2017; 
Montgomery and Evans 2006; Price et al. 2004; Sealy et al. 
1995; Sjögren and Price 2013; Snoeck et al. 2020). For more 
detailed information on Sr isotopes, see (Bentley 2006; 
Faure 1986; Montgomery 2010; SI 2).
We used the Sr isotope baseline published in Blank et al. 
(2018b). The baseline was constructed by isotope ratios 
of 89 samples from water and small non-domestic fauna 
from locations with various geological characteristics in 
Västergötland (Blank et al. 2018b). The Sr isotope range 
between 0.714 and 0.719 is here referred to as “Local”, as 
this span occurs within Kinnekulle (Fig. 6). However, this 
range partly overlaps with the ranges of other sedimentary 
areas within the region as well as terrains south of Falbygden 
(Fig. 6). According to the interpolated surface model, the 
Sr isotope ratios where the gallery graves are found ranges 
from 0.714 to 0.717 (Fig. 6). In the surrounding Precambrian 
areas ratios between 0.719 and 0.726 are found, which we 
consider “Non-local within VG”. Higher ratios appear east 
and north-east of Kinnekulle (Fig. 6; Åberg 1995; Åberg and 
Wickman 1987; Löfvendahl et al. 1990). Thus, Sr isotope 
ratios above 0.726 are referred to as “Non-local outside VG”, 
as are Sr isotope ratios below 0.712. Sr isotope ratios below 
0.712 are not found in Västergötland but have been recorded 
in Scania, in Denmark, at Öland and in coastal areas such as 
the Swedish west coast and further away (Arcini et al. 2016; 
Bergerbrant et al. 2017; Fornander et al. 2015; Fraser 2018: 
61; Frei and Frei 2011; Frei and Price 2012; Klassen et al. 
2020; Oras et al. 2016; Sjögren et al. 2009; Wilhelmson and 
Ahlström 2015).
Enamel sample preparation and strontium isotope anal-
ysis were carried out at the Curt Engelhorn Center for 
Archaeometry in Mannheim, Germany following Knipper 
et al. (2012) and at the Danish Center for Isotope Geology, 
University of Copenhagen, Denmark by Karin M Frei and 
Robert Frei. A blind test was performed in a previous study 
and the difference between the results from the same tooth 
obtained at the two laboratories was <0.0001 (Blank et al. 
2021). For more details on the preparations and analyses, 
see SI 2.
Carbon and nitrogen isotopes
Stable isotope analysis of human collagen is a recognized 
method of estimating general consumption patterns and 
subsistence. Analyses of δ13C can be used to distinguish 
terrestrial from marine diets (Sealy 1986). In the Atlantic/
North Sea region, terrestrial mammals have δ13C end values 
of bone collagen ranging from −20 to −21‰, whereas the 
marine end value is about −10‰ (e.g. Barrett et al. 2011; 
Fischer et al. 2007). Intermediate δ13C would thus reflect a 
combination of marine and terrestrial proteins. Furthermore, 
consumers of freshwater and marine fish, and other aquatic 
predators have higher δ15N values, up to 15‰ or even 20‰,

   94 
as aquatic food webs have generally longer food chains than 
land-based webs (Schoeninger et al. 1983: 130). The δ15N 
values increase along the food web, although different frac-
tional levels have been suggested ranging between 3 and 
6‰ per trophic level (e.g. Ambrose 2000; Bocherens and 
Drucker 2003; DeNiro and Epstein 1981; Hedges and Rey-
nard 2007; O’Connell et al. 2012). Thus, the interpretation 
of the origin of the protein might differ depending on which 
fractionation level is considered. The enrichment of stable 
isotopes and reservoir effects are further discussed in SI 2.
Reference samples from LN and EBA fauna and flora 
are few and therefore no quantitative dietary reconstructions 
were performed. However, the stable isotope analyses of 
both collagen and enamel enable us to get a relatively good 
idea of the general diet, as bone collagen mainly reflects 
protein intake, while bone and enamel carbonate (apatite) 
mirrors overall dietary components (protein, carbohydrates, 
and fats). Furthermore, the difference between the δ13C in 
apatite and the δ13C in collagen (the collagen-apatite spac-
ing) observed in carnivores is smaller than in herbivores 
(Ambrose and Norr 1993; O’Connell and Hedges 2017). 
The collagen-apatite spacings are 6.8±1.4‰ for herbivores, 
5.2±0.8‰ for omnivores, and 4.3±1.0‰ for carnivores 
(Hedges and Van Klinken 2002; Lee-Thorpe et al. 1989; 
O’Connell and Hedges 2017).
Analyses of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in colla-
gen were conducted at the 14Chrono Centre, Queens Univer-
sity, Belfast. The stable carbon isotope analyses of bioapatite 
were performed at the Institute of Geosciences, Department 
of Applied and Analytical Palaeontology at the University 
of Mainz, Germany. Methods of sample preparation and iso-
tope analyses are described in the SI 2.
Biomolecular analysis
Ancient DNA from human remains can provide information 
concerning biological sex, genetic inheritance, biological 
kinship relations, population history, and diseases (Bramanti 
2013). This study includes sex assessments and reports mito-
chondrial (mtDNA) haplogroups. The mtDNA can only be 
passed on by the mother to an offspring and can be used to 
establish relatedness on the maternal side. Haplotypes are 
a combination of sequence variants derived via mutations 
from an ancestral sequence. Haplotypes which have a simi-
lar origin can be arranged in haplogroups (Bramanti 2013).
All aDNA analyses were performed at Uppsala Univer-
sity. DNA extraction and library preparation were conducted 
in a clean room laboratory dedicated to ancient DNA work. 
Illumina shotgun sequencing was performed at SciLife 
SNP&SEQ platform. Bioinformatic data processing was 
computed using the resources of Uppsala Multidisciplinary 
Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX). 
DNA extraction and library preparation, shotgun sequenc-
ing, data processing, and analyses of mtDNA haplogroups 
and genetic sex assessments were conducted as presented in 
Blank et al. (2021).
Statistical analyses
The data evaluation included descriptive statistics, cor-
relation, and significance tests. The non-parametric 
Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine whether the 
observed differences were statistically significant at the 
5% level. This test was favoured because of the non-nor-
mal distribution of values. Furthermore, statistical meth-
ods such as Bayesian and KDE models were included, 
described in SI 2. The calibrations, plots, and models of 
the radiocarbon dates were conducted using the OxCal 
online software version 4.4.4 (Bronk Ramsey 2021, 
Bronk Ramsey 2009) and the IntCal20 atmospheric curve 
(Reimer et al. 2020).
Results
Artefacts
The artefacts recovered from the gallery graves mainly 
consist of common objects found in LN gallery graves 
throughout Scandinavia (Anderbjörk 1932; Ebbesen 
2007; Østmo 2011; Weiler 1994). However, in two graves 
(Medelplana 54 and Österplana 27), flint artefacts (a 
tanged blade arrowhead and a thin bladed polished flint 
axe) dating to the MN were found (Table 2). A now lost 
shaft-hole axe has been reported from Österplana 27 
(Nyström 1886).
The majority of the artefacts consist of flint objects 
(Table 2). Most of these were produced from imported 
south Scandinavian flint from Denmark and Scania, 
although in the Medelplana 54 grave, two of the arrow-
heads were made of local Cambrian flint from Kinnekulle. 
Nine flint daggers were recovered in the graves and all of 
them were of late types (IV–V) according to Lomborg’s 
(1975) typology. The two daggers of unknown type in 
Medelplana 54 might be of type VI but may also be of 
earlier types. At least two of the daggers had been used as 
strike-a-lights.
Slate pendants were recovered in two of the graves and 
part of a flint sickle in Medelplana 54. According to a pre-
vious study of artefacts in gallery graves in inland south-
western Sweden (Blank 2022), both these types of artefacts 
can be dated to the later part of LN or EBA. Bone needles, 
which were found in Österplana 27, are common objects in 
gallery graves and primarily interpreted as dress pins. Bone 
artefacts may have been overlooked during excavation as 
much of the skeletal remains were left or reburied at the 
sites. No amber artefacts were recovered.

Osteology and genetic sex assessments
Medelplana 54
A minimum number of 20 individuals, 17 adults, and three 
juveniles were osteologically analysed. The skeletal remains 
were commingled, but the remains consisted of at least six 
males and eight females, when only osteological estimates 
were considered. A subset of the individuals was sampled 
for aDNA (N=13) and 11 of them could be genetically sex 
assessed (SI 1, 2). The six males determined morphologi-
cally were confirmed to be genetic males also. Two morpho-
logically undetermined adults were also shown to be genetic 
males. Furthermore, one individual (MM4) was estimated as 
a probable female based on the morphology of the mandible, 
but the DNA analysis provided a male sex, giving a total 
of nine males within the tomb. Two individuals that could 
not be osteologically assessed for sex were determined as 
females through aDNA (MM8 and MM12). Both females 
were aged as over 20 years. Unfortunately, only a subset of 
the osteologically assessed female individuals could be sam-
pled for chemical analyses due to the lack of jaws with teeth 
in situ. One or more of the mandibles with undetermined 
sex could be linked to females that were morphologically 
assessed through traits of the pelvis or cranium, which is 
why the MNI count does not increase with the genetically 
assessed females.
All males were possible to assess with age: 17–25 years 
(N=2), 25–35 years (N=3), and 35–45 years (N=1), as well 
as one individual under the age of 20 years and two individu-
als over 20 years. It should be noted, however, that dental 
attrition is closely connected to cultural behaviour such as 
diet and the use of teeth as tools, and the estimates should 
therefore be considered tentative only. Three children were 
identified: 3–5 years, 7–9 years, and 10–12 years, according 
to tooth development.
The frequency of dental caries could be calculated from 
159 scorable post canine permanent teeth, both in situ in the 
jaws and loose teeth. Eleven of the teeth showed some sort of 
carious lesions, with the majority situated interproximal on 
the molars. This corresponds to a frequency of 6.9%. Only 
three deciduous molars could be analysed, none of them 
exhibiting carious lesions.
Signs of general physiological stress were evident both as 
cribra orbitalia (CO) and linear enamel hypoplasias (LEH). 
CO was detected in 7/28 (25%) of the examined orbits (both 
left and right), most of them showing signs of healing. LEH 
could be registered in 24/212 (11.3%) of the permanent 
teeth. None of the deciduous teeth showed signs of LEH.
Noteworthy is that the number of traumatic injuries is 
relatively high considering the limited number of individu-
als. Most injuries were probably caused by accidents. A total 
number of 11 elements showed signs of trauma, out of which 
nine showed evidence of some, or extensive, healing. Two of 
the injuries (skull traumas) are so poorly preserved that post-
mortem damage cannot be ruled out. Fibiger et al. (2013) 
provide information of one perimortem fracture on the left 
parietal of a male, which may correspond to one of these 
uncertain peri-/post mortem traumata. The healed traumata 
include two left femoral neck fractures, one of which may 
be associated to a trauma on the left ilium. Six other traumas 
were found: another iliac fracture (which might be the same 
individual as the other femoral neck fracture but this cannot 
be definitely concluded), one fracture of a left twelfth rib, 
one fractured first finger phalange, one fracture of the styloid 
process of a left ulna, a fractured left orbit of a female, and a

fractured left lower jaw of a male. It is possible that the two 
skull traumata are related to violent acts.
Lastly, one individual showed evidence of significant 
erosive lesions of the endocranial surface of the occipi-
tal. These types of lesions are generally considered to be 
caused by haemorrhage or inflammation of the meningitis, 
but the reason could be multicausal, such as, e.g. tuberculo-
sis, trauma, vitamin deficiency, and tumours (Lewis 2004). 
Unfortunately, it is not possible to link this cranium with 
any of the individuals sampled for isotope analysis due to 
the commingled state of the remains.
Österplana 27
From Österplana 27, skulls from a minimum number of 25 
individuals were osteologically analysed. The skulls corre-
spond to 19 adults and 6 subadults, with the sexes among the 
adults equally distributed (8 females, 9 males, and 2 adults 
of indeterminate sex). The individuals that were sampled for 
isotope analyses were all males (SI 1, 2), two of them in their 
late teens or young twenties, and one in his older twenties 
or early thirties. aDNA data from three of the osteologically 
determined males confirms that they were also genetic males 
(SI 1, 2).
Since only skulls were available for analysis, the osteo-
logical data is sparse and only include evidence of patho-
logical conditions of the head region, which is of course 
affecting interpretations on health. Particularly interesting 
is evidence of violence. Out of the 19 adult skulls, two (10.5 
%) show evidence of trauma, both ante-mortem and peri-
mortem. The presence links to the general increased trend of 
skull traumata seen in LN-EBA southern Sweden (Tornberg 
2022). One of each sex was affected. The female, an older 
adult, has an almost completely circular, 23.3×23.4 mm, 
healed fracture above the right orbit. She also has a button 
osteoma, i.e. a benign bone tumour, at the midline of the 
frontal bone. Lastly, the female also exhibits a peri-mortem, 
blunt force fracture on the margin between the right frontal 
and parietal bones. It is evident that the individual suffered 
from at least two violent events throughout her lifetime, 
one of which was probably the cause of death. The button 
osteoma should not have caused any health problems for the 
individual. The other cranium is from a male that seems to 
have died a violent death, with a peri-mortem fracture vis-
ible on his left frontal.
Only three individuals, a young male and two subadults, 
showed evidence of general stress in the form of cribra 
orbitalia. The individuals were not chosen for dating and 
isotope analyses.
Noteworthy is the high occurrence (8/25 individuals) of 
extra sutural bones/ossicles, i.e. a non-metric skeletal trait, 
in the material. Sagittal, lambdoid, and apical ossicles are 
all present. Individuals of both sexes (1 male, 3 females, 2 
indetermined, 2 subadults) express ossicles of some sort. It 
is possible, however far from conclusive, that these traits 
correspond to genetic affinity (Larsen 2015; Konigsberg 
et al. 1993; Sjøvold 1984).
Medelplana 18
The osteological material from the Medelplana 18 gallery 
grave was only represented by a right mandible with pre-
molars and molars in situ, a right proximal femur from an 
adult, and a loose upper left first molar. The loose first molar 
was sampled for biochemical analyses (see above). There are 
no clear morphological traits for sex estimations. However, 
the mandible exhibits more masculine than feminine char-
acters, and the dimension of the femoral head is suggestive 
of male sex. Thus, the sex estimations are to be considered 
tentative only. However, the loose molar tooth belonged to a 
female according to sex assessment based on aDNA (SI 1). 
The teeth in the mandible are heavily worn, indicative of an 
age between 35 and 45 years, using Brothwell’s (Brothwell 
1981) model. The upper first molar has a wear pattern in 
accordance with an age of 25–35 years, thus probably not 
from the same individual as the mandible. As such, the mini-
mum number of individuals remaining from Medelplana 18 
is two. However, as already mentioned, the grave contained 
many more individuals but most of the recovered skeletons 
were reburied after the excavation.
mtDNA haplogroups
In general, the samples displayed the properties expected for 
ancient DNA data. The average read length ranged from 50 
to 82 base pairs, and ratios of C to T and G to A damages at 
the ends of the reads ranging from 0.10 to 0.37. Mitochon-
drial aDNA haplogroups were determined for 7 individuals 
in Medelplana 54 and from one individual in Österplana 27 
(SI 1, Table 3). The eight individuals that yielded mtDNA 
data all displayed unique haplotypes. The mtDNA haplo-
groups are presented in Table 3 and in Fig. 7 is the distribu-
tion of simplified mtDNA haplogroups over time.
Radiocarbon dates and burial sequences
In this study, the radiocarbon dates, which previously were 
part of a compilation study of 215 14C dates from Swed-
ish megalithic graves (Blank et al. 2020), were recalibrated 
and used for discussing and modelling the use time of these 
specific graves. The collagen quality of the all 18 samples 
was acceptable with C:N atomic values ranging between 
3.14 and 3.31 (SI 1, Bronk Ramsey et al. 2004; Van Klinken 
1999). There were no signs of freshwater or marine reservoir

effect, with regard to the stable isotopes and collagen apa-
tite-spacing (see Carbon and nitrogen isotopes in SI 2), and 
the typological dates of the related finds (see “Artefacts”).
In Fig. 8, the 18 radiocarbon dates are presented in a 
sum plot. One of the individuals is dated to ca. 3500–3100 
BC, 95.4%, while the remaining burials range ca. 
1900–1490 BC, 95.4%.
Medelplana 54
The fourteen sampled individuals from this grave were dated 
to an interval spanning from the LN II to the EBA period II 
(1889–1442 BC, 95.4%) (SI 1). According to the sum plot, 
most of the radiocarbon dates fall in the transition between 
LNII and EBA. Two burials can be dated to the LNII and 
three burials to the EBA period I/II (Fig. 9). The sum plot 
suggests a use time of the grave of about 460 years.
We produced two statistical models of the radiocarbon 
dates (a Bayesian and a KDE model) to investigate the time 
of use further. However, we are dealing with data lacking 
reliable prior information as the dates derives from commin-
gled skeletons without stratigraphic information. So, in this 
case, we must assume the priors. In the Bayesian approach, 
the events are in one or another way compressed, depending 
on the chosen model (see statistical models in SI 2). The 
model with the best fit according to the agreement indexes is 
presented here, which is a model based on one single phase 
where the events are assumed to be randomly sampled from 
a uniform distribution (Fig. 10).
In this model, the dates span from the LNII to EBA period 
I, with most dates concentrated to the transition between 
LNII and EBA. As the dates are compressed towards the 
centre, the estimated time of use appears shorter than in 
the sum plot, suggesting 220 to 330 years of burial activity 
(1832–1683 to 1649–1499 BC, 95.4% and 1779–1709 to 
1626–1555 BC, 68.3%).
KDE model is a non-parametric method of kernel density 
estimation and can be described as a mixture of the Bayesian 
and frequentist methods. According to this model, the dates 
span from the LNII to the EBA period II, with a peak in the 
LNII (Fig. 11). Here, the time of use was estimated between 
300 and 400 years (1856–1687 to 1622–1448 BC, 95.4% and 
1781–1694 to 1614–1486 BC, 68.3%). We would consider

this model relatively reliable if the total number of burials 
was 20, and not 60 (see “Site description”).
If the number of inhumations were 20 in 300 years, we 
can assume that an average of ca. 1.7 individuals was buried 
per generation (25 years). In the scenario of 60 inhumations, 
the number of buried individuals would instead be five buri-
als per generation, although the use time of the grave may in 
this case not be reliable.

Österplana 27
Two individuals from Österplana 27 gallery grave were 
dated to the LN II-EBA, between 1884 and 1664 BC (95.4%) 
while one individual was dated to 3500–3109 BC (95.4%, 
Fig. 12), covering the end of the EN and the beginning of 
the MN periods.
Thus, the radiocarbon dates indicate two phases of use, 
one in the transition between the EN and MN and another 
in the transition between LN and EBA. However, alternative 
explanations such as the reburial of an old skull in a LN/
EBA grave are also possible. As the number of burials is at 
least 25 (see above) or originally even about 50 burials as 
suggested by Nyström (1886), three individuals cannot reli-
ably reflect the burial sequence.
Strontium isotope ratios
Strontium isotope ratios from enamel of 34 teeth from 17 
individuals ranged from 0.711 to 0.736. A few gaps can be 
observed, where no samples occur, such as 0.712 to 0.714, 
0.723 to 0.725, and 0.731 to 0.733. The Sr isotope ratios are 
similarly spread between the different tooth types (Fig. 13).
Interestingly, most of the samples (N=28, 71%) fall 
outside the local range of Kinnekulle (Table 4). Of these, 
18 samples (53%) display Sr isotope ratios that accord-
ing to current knowledge are only found outside of the 
Västergötland region. A first and a second molar from 
the same individual exhibit relatively low Sr isotope 
ratios (0.711). Such ratios are not found in Västergöt-
land and the closest locations where these ratios have 
been recorded are the Swedish west coast, Scania, and 
Denmark (see method). At the other end of the scale, 16 
samples from 10 individuals have Sr isotope ratios above 
0.726, which occur to the east and northeast of Västergöt-
land (see method).
If the number of individuals with different origin is calcu-
lated, two individuals only yielded Sr isotope ratios within 
the local range, while 15 displayed ratios non-local to Kin-
nekulle (Table 4). The three individuals from Österplana 
27 all exhibited non-local ratios from outside Västergötland 
(Fig. 14).
Some chronological differences can be observed in the 
mobility patterns (Fig. 14). The two lowest Sr isotope ratios 
(ca. 0.711) belong to the earliest dated individual (EN/MN) 
and also the only individual preceding the LN. Furthermore, 
the highest Sr isotope ratios, above 0.732, were measured in 
enamel from individuals dated to the transition between the 
LNII and EBA. According to the Sr isotope data from the 
LN-EBA individuals, at least three different areas of origin 
can be assumed (Fig. 14).
There are some slight but not statistically significant vari-
ations between sites, with the highest values observed in 
the samples from Medelplana 54, and the lowest in Öster-
plana 27 (Mann–Whitney U test p= 0.531). The proportion 
of samples within the local range is low and in Österplana 
27, no samples fall within this range (Fig. 14). However, the 
uneven distribution of samples may affect the results.
In Medelplana 54, the Sr isotopes range from 0.718 to 
0.736 and only two individuals (five teeth) have ratios within 
the Kinnekulle local range. Five individuals exhibit 87Sr/86Sr 
between 0.719 and 0.726, which can be found in the sur-
rounding area of Kinnekulle, while eight individuals display 
even higher ratios which are found further away, possibly in 
a more north-eastern direction. In Österplana 27, the ratios 
range between 0.711 and 0.732. All three sampled individu-
als displayed non-local ratios which most likely originate 
from outside VG. The single individual from Medelplana 
18 exhibits a ratio local to Kinnekulle (Fig. 14).
In the individuals where several teeth were sampled, indi-
vidual movements could be observed (Fig. 14). At Öster-
plana 27, the Sr isotope ratios of the EN-MN adult individ-
ual MP3 indicate that this person spent his early childhood 
in an area with relatively low ratios, possibly at the Swedish 
west coast, in Scania or in Denmark. The ratio of the third 
molar of the same individual indicates that he moved to 
more radiogenic terrains that can be found within Västergöt-
land, at the age of 7 to 16 years, whereafter he moved to 
Kinnekulle or was transported there after death. The two 
other men from Österplana 27 (MP1, MP2) showed Sr iso-
tope ratios suggesting movements outside of Kinnekulle (in 
VG and in more eastern/northeastern regions) during child-
hood (Fig. 14). MP1 has moved to a more radiogenic terrain

during childhood while MP2 seems to have remained sta-
tionary during his early life. These people may have moved 
into Kinnekulle sometime after the age of ca. 8 years or 
could have been brought there only to be buried.
In Medelplana 54, one individual (MM3) seems to have 
spent his childhood at Kinnekulle or other locations with 
similar Sr isotope ratios. In the individual MM4 (an adult 
male), the ratios of the different teeth indicate a move from 
the Precambrian surrounding areas into Kinnekulle at an age 
of 3 to 8 years (Fig. 14). Both of these individuals display Sr 
isotope ratios in their later forming molars estimated in the 
proximity to the grave sites (0.714–0.717). The remaining 
six individuals exhibit non-local Sr isotope ratios in all their 
sampled teeth. Five of them display non-local ratios from 
outside VG in at least one tooth. Two individuals display 
non-local ratios found within VG in the early forming teeth 
and non-local ratios from outside VG in the third molars. 
Three display non-local ratios from outside VG in all teeth. 
Thus, movements in the surrounding areas of Kinnekulle 
and from areas further to the northeast during childhood 
and early youth are suggested. Furthermore, four of the six 
individuals only displaying non-local ratios indicate that 
they could not have moved to Kinnekulle before the age of 
ca. 16 (MM2, MM7, MM11, MM12). The other two (MM5, 
MM13) might have moved to Kinnekulle after the age of 
ca. 8 years (Fig. 14). However, the bodies or even specific 
skeletal elements only might have been brought to the area 
after the time of death to be buried.
Nitrogen and carbon isotopes
The δ15N and δ13C values in collagen
 We obtained stable isotope data of collagen from 18 indi-
viduals. The δ15N values ranged between 9.1 and 13.3‰ 
and the δ13C values between −21 and −19.5‰. In Table 5, 
summary statistics of the stable isotopes in collagen are 
presented. The mean values of both δ15N and δ13C more 
or less remain the same regardless of inclusion of the EN/
MN sample or not (Table 5). However, there is a difference 
in the δ15N values if the outliers (MM12 and MM7) are 
included or not.
The samples from skull and mandibular bones exhibit 
lower δ15N and δ13C values than the tooth samples and there 
was a significant difference in δ15N values between bone 
and tooth samples (Mann–Whitney U test, p=0.006). One 
of the first molars from individual MM12 (an LNII/EBA 
adult female with Sr isotope ratios non-local to VG) and one 
of the first premolars of MM7 (an EBA adult male with Sr 
isotope ratios non-local to VG) displayed rather high δ15N 
values, which at least in the first case (MM12) might indi-
cate a breastfeeding effect. In MM7, but also in MM12, an 
intake of marine protein in early life is possible since δ13C 
is also somewhat elevated. The lowest δ13C value belongs to 
a mandible from a LNII juvenile (MM9), whose first molar 
displayed Sr isotope ratios non-local to VG (Fig. 15, SI 1).
There are too few samples and too short a time span for 
discussing any chronological changes. Nevertheless, some 
tendencies and figures of the stable isotope values over time 
are presented in SI 2.
The uneven numbers of samples from the three sites make 
it problematic to compare the stable isotope values between 
graves. Nevertheless, it can be noted that the δ15N values 
in the few samples from Österplana 27 and Medelplana 18 
are slightly lower than the values measured in the human 
remains from Medelplana 54 (SI 2).
In Fig. 16, the sex and the age that the bones and teeth 
represent (considering the type of tooth or bone along with 
the estimated age of death) are presented. No distinct dif-
ferences between the stable isotopes of males and females 
or age categories can be found (Fig. 16). Nevertheless, only 
males exhibit nitrogen values below 9.6‰. The groups of 
males with these low values are of different ages and the 
samples consist of four bones and a first premolar from the 
EBA male MM4.
The δ13C values in enamel and collagen‑apatite spacing
 The 29 enamel samples that yielded δ13C values displayed 
values between −15.3 and −12.8‰ with a mean value of 
−14.28‰ (SI 1, Table 6). First, second, and third molars, 
which mirror different age spans (see “Sampling strategy and 
selection criteria”), were sampled. The highest δ13C values 
are found in the second molars (ca. 3–8 years), while the first 
molars (ca. 0–3 years) yielded the lowest values (Fig. 17). A 
statistically significant difference only occurs between these 
two tooth types (Mann–Whitney U, p=0.020). This pattern 
can be observed also between teeth from the same individual 
where the values differ up to 0.7‰ (Fig. 17). Such a differ-
ence might suggest a change in diet at, or prior to, the time 
of development of the enamel in the second molars.
The mean values of both δ13C in enamel and the collagen 
apatite-spacing only change insignificantly when the EN/

MN samples are excluded (Table 6). The collagen-apatite 
spacing supports an omnivorous diet with a relatively high 
intake of plant food (see method).
According to Fig. 17, some chronological variation of 
the δ13C values occurs. The lowest values can be observed 
in the individuals dated to the LNII, with higher values in 
the EBA, and the most varied values seems to appear in the 
transition between the LN and EBA (Fig. 17). In the periods 
with more than five samples (LNII/EBA and EBA), there is a 
significant difference between the δ13C values (Mann–Whit-
ney U test, p=0.010).
Only one female (three teeth) was identified among the 
individuals sampled for δ13C in enamel, while 12 of the 
individuals (22 teeth) could be determined as males. No 
differences in the enamel δ13C values between the sexes 
could be observed (Fig. 17).
The values vary the most in Medelplana 54, where most 
of the samples derive from (Fig. 18). The Österplana 27 
individuals exhibit stable isotope values in the lower part 
of the total range and according to the Mann–Whitney U 
test, the difference in δ13C values between the two sites is 
statistically significant (p=0.032).
Collagen-apatite spacing of 16 individuals ranged 
between 5.0 and 7.2‰ (Table 6; Fig. S9). Most samples 
display collagen apatite spacings below 6.5‰. However, 
samples from two individuals (MM1 and MM2) buried in 
Medelplana 54 exhibit collagen-apatite spacings above 7‰ 
(Fig. S9).

Discussion
Burial sequences
To evaluate the time of use of the graves, we consider both 
the radiocarbon dates of the human remains and the typolog-
ical dates of the artefacts found in the graves. It is important 
to point out that we are investigating the burial sequences 
and not the actual building of the graves. To date, the time of 
construction would require datable material within the grave 
structure (Dehn and Illum Hansen 2006).
Most of the artefacts found in the Kinnekulle gallery 
graves point to a use time concentrated to the last part of 
the LN and the first part of the EBA. This is indicated by 
daggers of late types, the presence of slate pendants and flint 
sickles, and the absence of amber beads (Anderbjörk 1932; 
Blank 2022). However, in two of the graves, arrowheads 
normally dated to the later part of the MN were recovered. 
These might have ended up in the grave at a later stage and 
might represent reused tools or possibly indicate that the 
typological chronologies should not always be considered 
absolute. Nevertheless, MN artefacts have been recovered 
in several graves defined as LN gallery graves in western 
Sweden (Blank et al. 2020).
The radiocarbon dates indicate that the three gallery 
graves were used contemporaneously in the LNII and EBA, 
although Medelplana 54 was used longer, into EB period 
II. The longer estimated use time probably results from the 
higher proportion of dated burials from this grave. The gal-
lery graves at Kinnekulle appear in the LN II, which is a 
period where new house types, increased importance of 
metal and cultivation can be observed (Apel 2001; Arturs-
son 2009; Vandkilde 1996). In Falbygden, the LN II is char-
acterized by increased human mobility possibly of groups/
families moving into the area (Blank et al. 2021).
Compared to Falbygden, where many of the human 
remains from gallery graves have been radiocarbon dated, the 
Kinnekulle graves seem to be slightly younger. In Falbygden, 
earlier LN burials have been confirmed indicating that these 
kinds of graves were introduced earlier in this area than at 
Kinnekulle (Fig. 19, Blank et al. 2020). Nevertheless, the Kin-
nekulle dates agree with the dating of most burials in gallery 
graves with port-holes in Västergötland (Blank et al. 2020).
One mandible in Österplana 27 was dated much earlier, 
to the transition between the EN and MN periods. In Fal-
bygden, a number of similar cases have been noted (Blank 
et al. 2020). There are several plausible explanations for the 
early find in Österplana 27. The grave might have been con-
structed already at this time and the bone may have been left 
from the first burial phase in the grave. Indications of clean-
ing out earlier skeletons from megalithic graves occur both 
during the MN and LN in Sweden (see Blank et al. 2020 
for more details). A recent study of megalithic graves in the 
Iberian Peninsula (Aranda Jiménez et al. 2020) suggested 
that cleaning out bones has resulted in earlier dates of teeth 
than of bone which represent the latest burial phase in the 
grave. The mandible might also have been put in the grave 
during the LN and may be a relic of an ancestor deposited in 
the new grave (see Blank et al. 2020 for further discussion).
To sum up, the gallery graves at Kinnekulle were used 
for up to 300–400 years in the LNII to the EBA period I/II. 
Considering the MN artefacts and the EN/MN human bone, 
a previous burial sequence in the graves during the MN may 
be possible, although these items may as well have been 
deposited in the graves during the LN.
Health and trauma
The observed caries frequency of 6.9% is comparable to other 
contemporaneous localities in southern Sweden (Blank et al.

2018a; Tornberg 2013, 2016). Evidence of linear enamel 
hypoplasia (11.3%) is also in line with the contemporaneous 
and geographically close locality of Falköping stad 5 (Blank 
et al. 2018a), while cribra orbitalia (25%) is significantly 
more common than in the Falköping stad 5 and the Scanian 
Abbekås materials (Blank et al. 2018a; Tornberg 2013), but 
similar to, or less common, than what is reported in other 
contemporaneous European skeletal assemblages (e.g. Ben-
nike 1985; Wittwer-Backofen and Tomo 2008). It seems that 
people in Neolithic-BA Scandinavia generally show fewer 
signs of pathologies related to diets rich in carbohydrates as 
well as less evidence of nutritional stress than populations 
in more southern latitudes (e.g. Cunha et al. 2007; Wittwer-
Backofen and Tomo 2008). The reason is difficult to assess, 
but probably foods rich in sugars, such as berries, fruits, and 
honey, were likely not as common in the diet in the north. 
Furthermore, signs of malnutrition are often caused by illness 
in the childhood, such as infections. As endemic infections 
are more likely to spread and sustain in more densely popu-
lated areas (Cockburn 1977: 109), the risk of large outbreaks 
of infectious disease was probably limited in the Kinnekulle 
area where population density presumably was low.
There is a general scarcity of remains from subadult indi-
viduals in the Kinnekulle gallery graves, especially regard-
ing the youngest age groups. It is possible that the low fre-
quency reflects a real decreased childhood mortality related 
to a generally low population density, thus, with a low risk 
of infectious disease mortality (Ahlström 2015), but could, 
in accordance with the osteological paradox (Wood et al. 
1992), be reflective of low fertility. Generally, the number of 
child deaths is more related to fertility than it is to mortality, 
since a relatively large proportion of children are expected to 
die in the first years of life due to frailty to infections (ibid). 
However, other reasons such as high levels of taphonomic 
loss, recovery bias, but also burial practices (see section 
below) might also explain the few remains of subadults.
Viewing the Kinnekulle remains in relation to the geo-
graphically close Falbygden, the proportion of subadults is 
substantially lower (Blank 2021; Tornberg 2018), which 
might be related to a significantly less dense population 
in the Kinnekulle area. In fact, the proportion of subadult 
remains from Falköping stad 5 is higher than from contem-
poraneous sites in Scania (Blank et al. 2018a; Tornberg 
2018), possibly reflecting a general correspondence between 
the number of gallery graves and population density (sta-
tionary or related to ritual/social gatherings) in this small 
geographical region. Better preservation for bones in the 
Falbygden area is also a plausible contributor to the pattern.
Both Medelplana 54 and Österplana 27 exhibit evidence 
of violence. Two individuals in each grave show signs of 
skull trauma. Although skull trauma might be caused by 
accidents, the placement and morphology of the injury in 
these cases rather reflect intentional violence. Depressed 
fractures above the hat brim line are more commonly found 
in cases of intentionally induced skull trauma, while linear 
fractures in the lower part of the back of the head more 
often is associated with falls (Ehrlich and Maxeiner 2002; 
Kremer et al. 2008; Li et al. 2021; Lovell 1997; Symes 
et al. 2012; Walker 1989). There seems to be no difference 
in the frequency of violence-related skull trauma between 
the Kinnekulle area and contemporaneous assemblages 
from Falbygden and Scania. In Falbygden, all of the skull 
trauma found in megalithic graves can be dated to the LN, 
which might indicate increased levels of violence from the 
MN to the LN in this area (Blank 2021: 111-112). This 
might be related to a probable population increase in the 
LN in general, where social stratification may have been 
more evident. Between 8.5 and 13% of the adult individu-
als inhumed in gallery graves in Västergötland and Scania 
had suffered from violence related skull trauma, both healed 
and unhealed (Tornberg 2022). There is, however, a ten-
dency towards higher levels of skull trauma in individuals 
inhumed in gallery graves than in other types of burials from 
the same period. Flat graves exhibit the lowest frequency 
(3.6%) and EBA barrows exhibit intermediate levels (11.1%) 
(Tornberg 2022). Most of the gallery grave remains are from 
the Västergötland region, while the analysed remains from 
flat graves and barrows are of Scanian origin (Ibid.). It is 
possible that the difference in frequency reflects regional 
differences in the presence of violence, but aspects like 
chronological differences and/or social differences between 
inhumations in the different burial types, hence different risk 
of violence, are other possible interpretations. It is, however, 
evident that violence (and warfare?) occurred regularly in 
LN-EBA southern Sweden, with frequencies of skull trauma 
exceeding, e.g. that of the famous Middle Bronze Age battle-
field of Tollense. Here, 7% of the victims evidenced ante- or 
peri-mortem skull trauma (Brinker et al. 2016), almost half 
of what is evident in south Swedish gallery graves. This 
difference might, however, be related to battle tactics, weap-
onry, and general differences in the use of violence.
Kinship and megalithic graves
Burying only 1.7 to 5 individuals per generation (see 
“Result”) is a low number compared to what can be expected 
from a group. One explanation could be that most of the 
people were interred in other types of graves and only a 
selected few were placed in gallery graves. Another possibil-
ity is that the graves were cleared out of old skeletal remains 
(see above). A further probable reason for the few burials 
compared with the long use time might be that the graves 
were intensively used for a few shorter periods of a few years 
spread over several hundreds of years.
It has been proposed that the interred in Funnel Beaker 
megaliths may represent a segment of the population, such

as a certain hierarchical level of society, and/or certain fami-
lies or groups (Blank 2021; Sjögren 2003). The LN gallery 
graves have been suggested to be graves reserved for a ruling 
elite (Artursson 2009). Others (Holm et al. 1997; Weiler 
1994) regard gallery graves as family graves for the local 
population. Certain individuals or families from a larger 
geographical area may have buried their dead in the gallery 
graves of Kinnekulle, which may explain some of the non-
local Sr isotope ratios measured in human teeth recovered 
from the graves.
Close kinship relations have been proven in Neolithic 
megalithic graves in England, Ireland, and Sweden (e.g. Cas-
sidy et al. 2020; Fowler et al. 2022; Sánchez-Quinto et al. 
2019) with the help of aDNA. Differences in the frequencies 
of mtDNA haplogroups between gallery graves have been 
noted in Falbygden, which may result from restricted mat-
ing patterns, and in some cases, a haplogroup was shared 
among several individuals, which may indicate maternal 
kinship relations within graves (Blank et al. 2021). The 
eight Kinnekulle individuals that yielded mtDNA data all 
displayed unique haplotypes, which excludes close maternal 
kin relations, at least between these eight individuals (SI 
1). We can, however, not exclude possible kinship relations 
among individuals at Kinnekulle, until autosomal DNA data 
from more individuals are analysed. The occurrence of extra 
sutural bones/ossicles in eight out of twenty individuals in 
Österplana 27 may, for example, result from genetic affinity 
(see “Osteology and genetic assessments”).
An equal number of males and females of different ages 
were buried in these graves, but as already discussed, sub-
adults are few. Young children may not have been considered 
fully integrated in the community, and therefore not treated 
in the same way in burial rituals (Hertz 1960: 76). For exam-
ple, infants have, in some cases, been found buried in settle-
ment contexts (post-holes of houses and below house floors 
etc.) and not in regular graves (Conklin and Morgan 1996: 
672; Hutton 1927; Ucko 1969: 270-271). Thus, the lack of 
remains from subadults in the gallery graves at Kinnekulle 
may reflect differences in burial practices of age groups as 
well as differences in child mortality rates and population 
density between Kinnekulle and Falbygden. Most probably, 
only part of the population was placed in the gallery graves 
at Kinnekulle, maybe groups (family or kin-related) of a 
certain status.
Mobility and exchange networks
According to the Sr isotope ratios of teeth from the indi-
viduals buried in the Kinnekulle gallery graves, only two 
individuals exhibited local ratios to Kinnekulle in all their 
sampled teeth, while four displayed non-local ratios to Kin-
nekulle but local to Västergötland, and another eleven indi-
viduals yielded ratios non-local to Västergötland.
Of the ratios non-local to Västergötland, one individual 
exhibited low values, which are found at the Swedish west-
coast, in parts of Scania, at Öland, in Denmark, and in 
coastal Estonia, etc. (Arcini et al. 2016; Bergerbrant et al. 
2017; Fornander et al. 2015; Fraser 2018: 61; Frei and Frei 
2011; Frei and Price 2012; Klassen et al. 2020; Oras et al. 
2016; Sjögren et al. 2009; Wilhelmson and Ahlström 2015). 
The Swedish west-coast, Scania, and/or Denmark are the 
most plausible origins considering the provenience of most 
of the flint finds in the graves (see below). The remaining ten 
individuals display high Sr isotope ratios which have been 
found in more eastern and northeastern regions with older 
bedrock (Åberg 1995; Åberg and Wickman 1987; Löfven-
dahl et al. 1990; Price et al. 2021). Two of the individuals, a 
male and a female, displayed Sr isotope ratios above 0.733 
(MM7 and MM12). They also displayed the highest δ15N 
values measured in the dentine samples.
Considering the different molars sampled from the indi-
viduals, movements between locations in the Precambrian 
terrains and Kinnekulle were indicated. Furthermore, Sr iso-
tope ratios in the different molars of the EN/MN individual 
MP3 indicate that this individual spent his early childhood 
in areas with low ratios, such as the Swedish west-coast, 
Scania, or Denmark and moved to the Precambrian regions 
of southwestern Sweden in late childhood/youth. This man-
dible may be the remains of an individual, originating from 
one of the regions suggested above, buried at Kinnekulle in 
the transition between the EN and MN periods. In another 
adult male, MM4, the Sr isotope ratios support a move to 
Kinnekulle at the age of 3 to 8 years from the surrounding 
Precambrian area.
Only three individuals exhibited Sr isotope ratios falling 
in the Kinnekulle local range in at least one tooth, suggest-
ing that the rest, 17/20 (85%), moved into the area in their 
adult lives or spent their whole lives outside of Kinnekulle 
and were only brought there to be buried. The observations 
might suggest that mostly adults moved in from different 
locations in the Precambrian areas and were buried in gal-
lery graves. Considering the small size of the mountain 
plateau, it seems possible that agricultural lands may have 
been located on different geological units with different bio-
logically available Sr on the plateau but also beyond, and 
resources from the surroundings may also have been used. 
Such landuse patterns may have contributed to the observed 
variation among different individuals and among teeth from 
the same individual.
It is also important to point out that no less than 11 indi-
viduals yielded Sr isotope ratios that indicate that they spent 
their childhood even further away from Kinnekulle, outside 
of Västergötland. A high degree of mobility, including long 
distance movement, in inland southwestern Sweden in the 
LN-EBA has been proposed based on Sr isotope data from 
Falbygden (Blank et al. 2021). As in Falbygden, the highest

variability in Sr isotope ratios occur in the LNII-LNII/EBA 
(Ibid.).
Many of the mtDNA haplogroups found in this study are 
known from other Neolithic contexts in Scandinavia and 
northern Europe (Allentoft et al. 2022; Bergerbrant et al. 
2017; Fraser et al. 2018a, b; Günther et al. 2018; Malmström 
et al. 2009, 2015, 2019; Skoglund et al. 2012, 2014).
In general, the mtDNA haplogroups of the LN and EBA 
individuals in the gallery graves at Kinnekulle concur with 
the haplogroups found in MN and LN/EBA skeletal remains 
from megalithic graves in Falbygden (Allentoft et al. 2022; 
Blank et al. 2021). Interestingly, the MN haplogroups in 
Falbygden, which seem to have disappeared in the LN, were 
absent also in the LN/EBA remains from Kinnekulle. For 
example, the I4 group, which is first seen at Kinnekulle in 
the EBA, is a new group that appears during the LNII in 
Falbygden. The T2 and U4, also present in the Kinnekulle 
samples, are two of the other groups that are first seen in 
the LN/EBA in the skeletal remains from Falbygden (Blank 
et al. 2021). This implies that new genetic populations were 
moving into the region during this time. This is especially 
interesting when adding the Sr isotope data indicating a high 
proportion of non-locals.
Considering the distribution of LN and EBA stray finds at 
Kinnekulle and the neighbouring areas (Blomqvist/Bäger-
feldt 1990; Weiler 1994), it seems likely that most of the 
buried individuals lived most of their lives outside of Kin-
nekulle and were only buried there. The variation in sta-
ble and Sr isotopes between the different graves may also 
indicate that the graves were used by different (kinship-)
groups with different residential origin and/or various net-
works. The Kinnekulle mountain might have been reserved 
for burials and linked to ancestors. The accessibility of lime-
stone is also a reason for building the megalithic graves at 
Kinnekulle. It is also possible that the area was an important 
gathering place for people living in the surrounding regions 
as suggested by the large rock art panels. More knowledge 
about possible settlements in the nearby area is needed.
The inland of southwestern Sweden during the LN end 
EBA is often perceived as peripheral to Scania and Denmark 
(Apel 2001; Kristiansen & Larsen 2005; Skoglund 2009). 
The only available flint at Kinnekulle is Cambrian flint, 
which was recovered from the Medelplana 54 grave. The 
local Cambrian flint has been found in LN gallery graves 
for example in Rångedala in southern Västergötland, indi-
cating regional networks. The remaining flint deposited in 
the graves was of south Scandinavian type and most prob-
ably originated from Scania or Denmark. Thus, both the MN 
and LN-EBA flint artefacts show the presence of networks 
(direct or indirect) with Scania and/or Denmark. Most of the 
LN daggers recovered in the graves display a high degree 
of technical skill, such as parallel flaking and punched 
seams. According to Apel (2001), these kinds of knapping 
techniques indicate that the daggers were imported from 
Denmark or southern Scania. However, skilfully pressure 
flaked arrowheads made in Cambrian flint indicate that at 
least some of the arrowheads were locally produced. The Sr 
isotope samples from the EN/MN individual indicate direct 
movement from the more southern regions at this time, 
while no such relation was observed in the later Sr isotope 
samples. However, short-term movements are difficult to 
trace using Sr isotope analysis.
Apart from pendants, slate artefacts are uncommon in 
Västergötland during the LN-EBA. Slate pendants are com-
mon in graves dated to the LN and EBA in Scandinavia with 
the highest frequency in Sweden. Sources of good quality 
slate are present in western Sweden, for example west of 
lake Vänern in Dalsland and in the more eastern region of 
Närke (Taffinder 1998). In both these areas, gallery graves 
with port-holes occur. Thus, the slate may be from a regional 
source, although the manufacturing and use of pendants 
reveal a more widespread shared ideology.
No bronze, gold, or amber accessories or jewelry, which 
appear in several gallery graves in southwestern Sweden 
were found in the Kinnekulle graves (Weiler 1994). The lack 
of amber artefacts might reflect poor preservation condi-
tions or that these objects often appear in early LN contexts 
(Anderbjörk 1932; Blank 2022), while the absence of metal 
objects may result from looting. Another explanation may 
be that import objects in general were less accessible in this 
area.
The presence of late dagger types and the late burials 
along with the lack of metal and amber might suggest that 
groups in the surrounding areas of Kinnekulle engaged in 
indirect long-distance networks at a later stage of the LN 
than other areas such as central Västergötland and Fal-
bygden. Thus, the Kinnekulle area would have been even 
more peripheral to the southern regions of Scandinavia 
than Falbygden and many other locations in Västergötland 
considering the long trade metal and flint networks exist-
ing in LN-EBA Scandinavia (Vandkilde 1996). The large 
proportion of human remains with high Sr isotope ratios 
might indicate that networks extending to more eastern and 
northeastern directions may have been dominant here dur-
ing the LN-EBA. Furthermore, the large rock carving site 
with several parallels to the west coast (Weiler 1994: 92), 
in the southeastern fringe of Kinnekulle dating back to the 
EBA, suggest that the area was an important regional node 
at that time.
Diet and subsistence
The stable isotope data indicate a terrestrial omnivore diet 
with a relatively high intake of plant foods. The significant 
difference observed in δ15N values between the tooth and 
bone samples probably reflects a shift between childhood

and adult diet, with protein intake from lower trophic levels 
in adults. Furthermore, comparisons of the stable isotope 
data among sites revealed higher δ15N collagen and δ13C 
enamel values in Medelplana 54. Differences between sites 
considering stable isotopes have been observed in previous 
studies of both MN and LN-EBA individuals in Falbygden 
(Blank 2021; Sjögren 2003). These differences may have 
resulted from slight variations in consumption patterns and/
or subsistence strategies between nearby sites. However, 
mobility patterns, for example people originating from dif-
ferent places at the various sites, may also be reflected in 
the stable isotope signals that go back to the childhood. The 
individuals (MM12 and MM7) with the highest non-local 
Sr isotope childhood ratios also displayed the highest δ15N 
values. Furthermore, a shift of δ13C enamel values as well as 
strontium isotope ratios between the first and second molar 
was observed in MM4. There is also a statistically significant 
difference of collagen-apatite spacing between the two non-
local groups, within Västergötland and outside Västergötland 
(SI 2), suggesting over-regional differences.
The Kinnekulle samples displayed slightly lower collagen 
apatite spacing and higher δ15N values than the LN-EBA 
megalithic population of Falbygden (Blank 2019, 2021; 
Fig. S7, S8). A plausible explanation is that the Kinnekulle 
individuals had higher proportions of fish and domestic 
animal-based foods in their diets than the people buried in 
the Falbygden megalithic graves. Noteworthy is, that the 
MN and the LN-EBA individuals of Falbygden, a diet more 
reliant on plant foods than in more eastern regions of Swe-
den has been proposed based on stable isotope data (Blank 
2021). Furthermore, the proximity to lake Vänern may also 
have resulted in a heavier reliance on freshwater fish of the 
people from Kinnekulle compared to the ones in Falbygden, 
although δ13C and δ15N values do not suggest more than 
marginal consumption of protein from freshwater sources.
In the LN period, increasing farmland, pastures, and for-
est clearance is indicated in the pollen data of the region 
(Berglund 2003; Enevold 2019; Fries 1951, 1958). The 
appearance of new find categories such as shaft-hole axes 
and flint sickles in large numbers and in new areas also 
suggests expanded cultivation. In the investigated gallery 
graves, one sickle was recovered, which indicates the pres-
ence of cultivation. At Kinnekulle, only a few scattered 
shaft-hole axes have been found, although high concentra-
tions occur in the Precambrian area south and southwest of 
Kinnekulle (Blomqvist/Bägerfeldt 1990: 26, Weiler 1994: 
113). This may indicate that most of the cultivation activity 
took place outside of Kinnekulle. Macrofossils and pollen 
analyses would be needed to further investigate this.
In two of the graves, scrapers were found, which may be 
associated to hide and skin preparation. Thus, keeping of 
livestock and/or hunting were probably part of the subsist-
ence strategies and there were many uses of the animals. The 
arrowheads recovered in the grave may have been related 
to hunting, although they are mainly interpreted as part of 
the weaponry of the “male warrior” along with the daggers 
(Apel 2001; Vandkilde 1996).
Subsistence economy with cultivation and husbandry is 
suggested and a terrestrial diet with a substantial intake of 
plant foods as implied by the collagen-apatite spacing and 
some consumption of freshwater fish. The high variability in 
𝛿15N values could indicate varied agro-pastoral strategies or/
and high human mobility. Considering the Sr isotope as well 
as the stable isotope data, most of the individuals may have 
been living in agriculture-based groups in nearby locations 
outside of Kinnekulle, at least seasonally.
Conclusion
The numerous gallery graves found at Kinnekulle reveal 
that the area was an important place for burial rituals, prob-
ably also for the commemoration of ancestors. Radiocarbon 
dates of human remains and finds from three of these graves 
indicate a use time spanning from the LNII, a time of sub-
stantial transformations, into the BA period II. There are 
no known graves from earlier periods, although one human 
bone from Österplana 27 was dated to the EN/MN period. 
The Sr isotope values of this individual are in accordance 
with the Sr signals found at the Swedish west coast, Scania, 
and Denmark.
The mtDNA haplogroups found in the Kinnekulle gallery 
graves agrees with mtDNA data from human remains dated 
to the same period from megalithic graves in Falbygden. The 
data support new groups appearing in southwestern Sweden 
during the LN that were not present in the MN period.
The Sr isotopes from the buried LN-EBA individuals 
indicate that most of them spent their childhood outside of 
the sedimentary area of Kinnekulle. The Sr isotope data and 
the distribution of stray finds and rock art sites suggest that 
the mountain plateau of Kinnekulle was reserved for the 
dead, while the people lived in the surrounding lower lying 
regions.
The stable isotope data and the archaeological circum-
stances indicate a subsistence economy based on cultivation 
and husbandry with a terrestrial diet and a substantial intake 
of plant foods. The relatively high 𝛿15N values, compared 
to other contemporary inland human remains, suggest that 
fishing also was part of the economy, although marginal, 
which seems logical considering the vicinity to the large 
lake Vänern.
The skeletal remains from the Kinnekulle area provide 
evidence of pathological lesions associated with general 
physiological stress and trauma comparable to other con-
temporaneous assemblages from Falbygden and Scania. The 
level of dental caries is similar to other contemporaneous

sites. It is evident that some of the individuals suffered 
from violence, but the levels of violence related trauma are 
not different from what is present in other LN-EBA gal-
lery graves. Although many similarities could be observed 
between Kinnekulle and other regions, the late dates of the 
Kinnekulle remains and artefacts support the view of the 
area as a peripheral part of the Scandinavian Late Neolithic 
cultural expression.
