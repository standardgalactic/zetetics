TYPEWRITER, KEYBOA: 
August Dvorak and William L. Dealey, 
Seattle, Wash. 
Application May 21, 1932, Serial No. 612,38 
13 Claims. 
Our invention relates to the spacial arrange 
ment of the keys in a typewriter keyboard. 
It has for its general objects (1) the provision. 
of a scientific plan of arranging the keys which 
5 will decrease the possibility of typeWriting errors, 
(2) facilitating increase of operating speed by 
eliminating awkward Sequences, (3) assisting in 
crease of speed because offewer errors, (4) lessen 
ing the fatigue of the typist, because of fewer 
10 interruptions due to errors, because of better ar 
rangement of the keys for typing the sequences 
most frequently used, and the rhythmical flow 
of typing induced thereby, and because of more 
evenly distributed labor for the individual fingers 
5 and the tWO hands. 
The general objects may be summed up by Say 
ing that we desire to produce an arrangement of 
the keys (having in mind the letter-sequences 
found in the most commonly used words of a 
20 language) such that the automatic rhythm of the 
operator, passing from one key to another in a 
Continuous flow of word-wholes and phrase 
wholes, best fits the 2nechanical rhythm of the 
typewriter. 
25. 
It is a further object to provide Such an ar 
rangement of the keys which will require no 
change in the typewriter mechanism or in the 
relative Spacing and position of all the keys of 
the keyboard considered as a whole, and which 
30 can be readily effected upon any standard type 
Writer now made by the simple interchanging of. 
type and key cards or labels. 
Other objects, particularly such as relate to the 
positioning of certain keys with relation to others, 
35 or the Selection of positions for certain keys or 
groups of keys, Will appear as this specification 
progresses. 
Previous attempts to improve the present so 
called “universal” keyboard have been confined, 
40 so far as we are aware, either to arbitrary rear 
rangements of letter-keys, without regard to their 
relationship to all other keys, or to studies of the 
tapping of isolated letter-keys and the counting 
of isolated finger loads and isolated letter errors. . 
45 Such factors are of importance only to the veriest 
beginner who has not mastered the spacial pat 
tern of the whole keyboard. With a person who 
has in any appreciable degree mastered this 
spacial pattern, typewriting proceeds in unified 
50 sequences or overlapping key-strokes identified as 
words and phrases. Words are stroked as wholes, 
and the typist is usually unaware of the indi 
vidual letters. Successful typing is the more or 
less relaxed following, by the typist, of such se- . 
55 gences (Word patterns) with the typewriter. A 
(C. 19-100) 
keyboard arrangement must be based upon the 
requirements of the sequential stroking, the even, 
uninterrupted flow of which we can designate 
“rhythm'. To count isolated letter strokes, then, 
does violence to the facts, for typewriting is not 5 
a sum of separate tappings by each finger. 
As an example, consider that if an expert, capa 
be of well beyond one hundred net words a min 
ute, should attempt one-letter copy, measure 
ments would show his speed to be absurdly slowed 0 
to approximately twenty words a minute. The 
isolated letter-stroke, as the alleged unit of type 
Writing, thus makes even experts appear ridicul 
OS. GateWood ('Individual Differences in Fin 
ger Reactions', E. L. Gatewood, Psychological li 
Review Monograph Supplements, vol. 28, No. 4, 
1920), in simple tapping experiments, shows that 
single-finger tapping is slower and less accurate 
than two-finger serial tapping. Nearly one-half 
of an expert's one-letter time would be saved on 20 
two-letter copy. Nearly one-fifth of the two 
letter-time would be saved on three-letter copy, 
and so on, improving through to six- or seven 
letter sequences. Typewriting, like reading moves 
not by individual letters, but in Word-Wholes or 25 
phrase-Wholes. 
- 
That typewriting Succeeds because a Succession 
of letter strokes is faster, than any stroke made 
separately, that without this overlapping of the 
strokes typing becomes a futile tapping, has 30 
hitherto not been generally understood. Accord 
ingly, our new method of keyboard revision 
launches itself for study. Of Sequences and of the 
possibilities for speed and accuracy gained by 
increasing the number of sequences stroked by 35 
opposite hands, or by remote fingers, or by the 
first and second adjacent fingers of the right . 
hand, 
Typewriting is a complex process, depending 
upon all the shifting variables of differing typists, 40 
notions, machines, and Surroundings. To con 
trol variables of typing motions involves keeping 
delicate balances between tension and relaxation, 
eliminating unnecessary movements, using the 
shortest, most direct motion paths, at the least 45 
possible energy-cost and feeling-cost. To in 
crease the advantages mechanically that accom 
pany fast motions, takes as few stops and starts 
as possible. Hence unavoidable finger waits are 
partly compensated by hovering lightly over keys. 50 
Typing motions, moreover, are correct when 
made in whatever way best fits them together. 
This is termed "play for position'. As a finger 
gets away fron a key, the next finger is already 
in position and stroking. These prompt plays for 55

position and overlappings between strokes permit 
faster timing and rhythm; anything, such as in 
correct or awkward position of the keys in the 
keyboard, which interrupts or slows down this 
rhythm, contributes to errors, to slower stroking, 
and to fatigue. 
The stroking unit, accordingly, is not an iso 
lated key-stroke, but embraces a complete inter 
wal of time between two Successive strokes. This 
time is set by the skill of the typist. A separate 
interval between the release of one key and the 
engaging of another is set by the machine. The 
rhythm of the machine must fit into the rhythm 
of the typist's stroking. The critical point is the 
finger's unnoticed and unfelt arrest as it strikes 
the keys. This must be the shortest pause that 
can be held and yet preserve the succession of 
strokes. Nearly all motion disappears into the 
release of the finger from the key. The Serial 
nature of key stroking depends upon this exact 
balance between the slight interval required by 
the machine and the longer interval required by 
the typist's fingers. Into a rhythmic pattern of 
sequence timing the flexible, changing key strokes 
are thrown in orderly succession. Automatic 
conditioning of the timing drops each even im 
print in its proper place. There are no isolated 
finger strokings, but rather, sequences. Each 
sequence is a definite pattern of successive over 
lapping strokes. 
Upon the present keyboard even two-letterse 
quence times vary widely. The discrepancies be 
tween the minimal times required in stroking 
certain sequences of keys as compared with other 
sequences of keys, are chiefly, due to the unavoid 
able delays inherent in certain spacial arrange 
ments upon the keyboard. For example, meas 
urements show these unavoidable delays increase 
as the spacial arrangements change from (1) a 
sequence in the same bank involving fingers of 
opposite hands, to (2) a sequence located in upper 
and lower banks yet still involving fingers of op 
posite hands, to (3) a sequence involving adja 
cent fingers of the same hand, to (4) a sequence 
located in upper and lower banks and involving 
fingers of the same hand, to (5) a sequence em 
ploying the same finger. 
unavoidable delays within digraphs on the pres 
ent “universal' keyboard are illustrated respec 
tively, as follows: (1) ei, 2 time-units; (2) em, 
4 time-units; (3) es, 5 time-units; (4) on, 10 
time-units; (5) de, 11 time-units. According to 
measurements reported, an expert's sequence 
times may vary from the equivalent of 70 words 
a minute for de to 224 Words a minute for n.d. 
The fastest two-letter sequences or digraphs are 
Written in familiar phrases by fingers of opposite 
hands, or remote fingers on the same hand, or 
first and second adjacent fingers on the right 
hand. 
Assuming an average speed of 130 words a 
minute, such two-letter sequences or digraphs in 
a familiar phrase like this is the may exceed 170 
words a minute. Continuing the illustration, if 
the total minimal time required for each digraph 
be taken, as in measurements of digraphs written 
at an average expert speed equivalent to 130 
words a minute, the relative times are, for ex 
ample, dic, employing opposite hands, 145; il, em 
ploying remote fingers of the same hands, 122; ik, 
employing adjacent fingers, 115; iii, tapping with 
the same finger, 85; um, reaching with the same 
finger, 70. Strokes with the same finger are thus 
found to be the poorest sequences in typing. 
Relative times of Such 
2,040,248 
According to measurements reported, simple tap 
ping with one finger of ii may take .14 second; 
with the second stroke one bank away, as im, .16. 
Second, and across two, banks of keys, as um, .17 
second. The pace is usually slowed, but less so, 
when adjacent fingers are used. 
a. 
Sequences (1) and (2) above, involving fingers 
of opposite hands, are seen to be rapid, and easy 
to stroke. Sequence (3), involving adjacent fingers. 
of the same hand, is not rapid, even with the 
first two fingers, as er, and frequently is difficult 
and slow of execution if it involves different banks, 
as nk, or fingers other than the first two, as as or 
wa. Sequence (4), involving upper and lower 
banks in the same hand, as ny, im, may be termed 
a hurdle. These are invariably slow and diffi 
Cult, as are reaches, sequence (5), movements by 
a single finger laterally, or from one bank to an 
adjacent bank, as fit, rt. 
The latter sequences, (4) and (5), and gen 
erally sequence (3), except as it involves the first 
two adjacent fingers, of the right hand especial 
ly, may be termed awkward sequences, because 
10 
15 
20 
their stroking does not fit into the rhythm of the 
typist so well as other more easily executed se 
quences, involving different hands, or remote 
fingers on the same hand. Such awkward set 
25 
quences are (1) time-consuming, (2) productive 
of errors, (3) unduly fatiguing, and (4) inter 
rupt the rhythm. These awkward sequences we 
have designed our keyboard to avoid, so far as 
possible, and have reduced the frequency of such 
awkward sequences to about 3%, while in the 
"universal' keyboard such awkward sequences 
are 28% of all frequencies. 
. . 
Any sequence involving a single-finger reach 
(by One finger alone) is extremely slow, because 
there can be no play for position, or overlapping 
of strokes. The “universal' keyboard, however, 
has a number of such reaches, as ik, iu, rt, fr, 
de, lo, of comparatively high frequency of oc 
currence. Certain of these, because of their high 
frequency, become familiar, and the error count 
is kept down, but the other three objections 
noted in the preceding paragraph are still pres 
ent. Hurdles by one finger alone are even more 
objectionable, yet a number of high frequency 
One-finger hurdles are found in the “universal' 
keyboard, as ce, ng, my, nu, mu. 
Scarcely less objectionable than single-finger 
reaches and hurdles are those requiring the use 
of adjacent fingers. These, too, can be classified 
as naturally awkward. The "universal' key 
board has such adjacent-finger reaches as aud, 
Se, SC, OS, De, er, ge, hi, ui, ol, io, po, pl, nk, 
ef, dr, day, et, and such adjacent-finger hurdles 
as eac, Cr, ct, be, e, in, im, some of them, as er, 
as, Se, 2.De, in, et, ev, for instance, being of very 
high frequency. . In the “universal' keyboard, 
21% of all frequencies are the awkward adja 
cent-finger reaches or hurdles, whereas our key 
board, to be explained hereafter, reduces this to 
2%. Remote finger hurdles such as act, no, mo, 
mp, are found in the “universal' keyboard to the 
extent of 3% of all frequencies, whereas our key 
board reduces these remote finger hurdles to .2%. 
Of all awkward sequences, single-finger and ad 
jacent-finger reaches and hurdles, the frequency 
in the "universal' keyboard is 28%, as we have 
explained above, and in our keyboard do not 
exceed 4%, being nearer 3%. The elimination

of such sequences saves time, lessens errors, less

It has not been recognized heretofore that se

volving two hands. Having discovered this to 
be the case, it follows that rapid successive strok 
ing can best be maintained if the successive 
strokes are in alternate hands. This is not be 
cause of any purpose to even up the loads upon 
the two hands, but rather is based upon the con 
sideration of maintaining the rhythm, for this 
latter in itself is the best assurance of lessened 
fatigue. We have discovered the desirability of 
distributing the keys to the two hands, in Such 
manner that the stroking of common sequences 
involves the use of alternate hands, insofar as 
possible. Being in opposite hands, reaches and 
hurdles are automatically eliminated. 
Likewise, we have discovered, and employ as 
a factor in determining the location of the keys, 
that Sequences in one hand (which cannot be 
wholly avoided) are most satisfactorily made 
when stroked from an outer finger inwardly. It 
is easier to tap in rapid succession from the fifth 
finger to the index finger, than the reverse. In 
our keyboard the common sequences necessarily 
falling in one hand are, so far as possible, stroked 
from an outer to an inner finger. Sequences 
which involve high frequency in each direction 
as er, re, are separated, and the letters given 
to different hands. 
The present keyboard has three banks of keys 
which contain all the letters of the English al 
phabet and the commonly used punctuation 
marks. The hands are guided with relation to 
the home row, that is, the middle bank, ... We 
have discovered the necessity, to avoid breaks in 
rhythm even in common sequences, of forming 
as many such sequences as possible in the home 
row. This avoids dropping to the lower bank 
and returning therefrom, which is very slow, and 
which is somewhat faster but still slower than 
sequences in the home row. As a result, we have 
been able to locate letters accounting for 70% 
of the total letter frequency in the home row. 
The rhythmical flow of complete sequences 
may be momentarily checked by an error. A 
single key stroke is felt chiefly, if at all, as such 
a misdirected stroke or error that temporarily 
blocks the rhythm of typing patterns. Errors 
are to be attacked only in their original line or 
phrase or word or shorter sequence setting. This 
is further shown in the fact that most false 
strokes are clean, effective strokes-to the Drong 
kegs. The following are samples of interference 
by more dominant sequences. For that the typ 
ist wrote the (2 seconds delay) t. For spectacle 
the typist wrote spec (.4 second delay) tab (1.2 
seconds delay) le. 
powe (.6 second delay) t (.3 second delay) ' (.4

second delay) s. For own heaven the sequence 
our first interfered with a belated correction 2D 
and the omission of n from the pattern, as foll 
lows: ol (.5 second delay), u) (4 Second delay) 
space (2 seconds) heaven. In these samples the 
more dominant sequences the, table, power, otr 
result in substitution, omission and addition of 
strokes. 
Moreover, the more dominant digraphs appear 
to hold down errors and facilitate speed despite 
handicaps of the present haphazard keyboard. 
The first finger patterns, for example, are dom 
inated by the terrific frequencies of th, on, art, 
he, in, nd, ha, at, en. Because of these key 
strokes, t, h, n, participate in very dominant, 
common sequences their relative efficiency is 
high despite keyboard handicaps. Similarly, on 
For poet's the typist wrote

the left hand, the C and e and it strokes are 
dragged above the usual inefficiency by partici 
pating in very dominant, common digraphs such 
as an, ha, at, ea, ar, as, er, re, he, ed., ent, es, ea, 
le, de, we, th, at, rat, ti, to, it, St, rt. 
Our studies of more than 11,000 errors by stu 
dent typists on the 1,000 most common words of . 
Ayres' list ("A Measuring Scale for Ability in 
Spelling'-L. P. Ayres-Russell Sage Foundation, 
New York, 1915, pp. 12-20) demonstrate that a 
relatively small number of word-sequences, fre 
quently typed to be sure, is responsible for a 
large portion of all typewriting errors. Whereas 
low-speed college beginners during eight weeks 
of practice piled up 28% of these errors upon the 
most common 50 everyday words, second year 
students actually heaped up 44% of like errors. 
This proportion of errors, in short, increased 
after eight weeks, One year, and two years of 
training, from 28% to 41%, to 44%, respectively. 
On the most common 300 words, the proportion 
of errors increased from 67% to 73%, to 77%, re 
spectively. In fact, the second year students 
actually made more errors on the first 25 words 
of the Ayres' list. Such a dilemma exposes the 
positive handicap of the present keyboard. 
We have collected the 300 word-sequences most 
often mistyped. The combined errors of these 
sequences amount to 75% of all the typing errors 
found in our-study of the typing of the thousand 
commonest words. In fact, 200 words account 
for 60%, while 100 words alone account for 45%. 
All but seven of these 100 words are simple mono 
syllables. Correct typing of these 100 words 
would have reduced errors on all common words 
by 45%. Examples of words characterized by 
frequent use in copy and excessive errors or diffi 
culty on the present keyboard, are: also, are, 
away, do, ever,'every, find, found, give, good, great, 
have, is, it, like, look, many, must, never, number, 
only, people, place, should, take, than, thank,

called "universal' keyboard can now be summar- " 
ized by ten criteria. In general, the very factors 
operating to produce errors also operate to reduce 
speed, as follows: 
(a) Many common sequences, in general, re 
quiring a difficult and awkward serial arrange 
ment of finger-motions. 
(b) Many digraphs typed with the same finger, 
whereas digraphs typed with different fingers are 
faster, due largely to improved play for position 
and Overlapping of keystrokes. 
(c) Many digraphs consisting of hurdles across 
banks by the same finger, with time wasted in 
the get-away, hurdle and pre-position. 
50 
60 
(d) An excessive number of sequences in the 
same hand, whereas digraphs employing opposite 
hands are faster. 
(e) An excessive number of sequence in the left 
hand, whereas right hand Sequences are usually 
faster. 
65. 
(f) Many digraphs employing adjacent fingers, 
notably in hurdles across banks, whereas most 
adjacent finger digraphs are slower than com 
binations utilizing remote fingers or opposite 
hands.

(g) The assigning of approximately 30% of the 
digraphs to include the lower bank, which is ex

patterns of the written language. 
A study of language patterns reveals a very 
striking fact. Spoken or written language is 
based on a framework built up of a relatively 
Small number of words, arranged in many pat 
terns. For example, less than 3% in some 80,000 
words used in 500 telephone conversations are 
different words. Little auxiliary verbs, such as 
is; pronouns, such as you; prepositions, such as 
on or to; conjunctions, such as and; articles, like 
the, are only 5% of the different Words used. 
Mostly these are monosyllables. Yet they make 
up 57% of all these 500 telephone conversations, 
as counted by French. Their framework sup 
ports the longer, more varied, less frequent Words, 
which convey most of the meaning. Although 
their role is somewhat lessened in written lan 
guage, it is these common Words which materially 
Set the digraphs to be typed. According to a 
scientific word count, for example 69 words rep 
resent one-half of written English; 640 words

represent four-fifths of written English. Typing 
patterns are based upon this framework of a rel 
2,040,248 
atively small-number of words which support the 
longer, more varied, less frequent words. Into 
this framework the typist's motions. are to be 
fitted with the aid of improved keyboard relations, 
An intensive study of the frequency with which 
different sequences.appear in written English is 
the basis for the scientific arrangement or the 
keyboard which we propose. The total frequen 
cies of usage of digraphs, trigraphs, four-, five-, 
and 
six-letter 
sequences 
studied, 
exceed 
75,000,000. 
A Scientific word count in written English 
shows the predominance of certain Sequences 
over others, to the extent: 
That 11 digraphs or two-letter combinations 
make up 25% of the usage of the millions of 
digraphs counted; 
That 34 digraphs make up 50%; 
That 57 digraphs make up 75%; 
That 137 digraphs make up 90%; 
That 22 trigraphs or three-letter combinations 
make up 25%; 
That 104 trigraphs make up 50%; 
That 46 four-letter combinations make up 
25%; 
That 208 four-letter combinations make up 
50%. 
To facilitate the revision of the typewriter key 
board, a master sheet of common digraphs is 
constructed as follows:

In the light of these digraph frequencies, a 
chart of the present "universal' keyboard is pre 
sented in Table No. 2, and a chart of the new 
improved keyboard is presented in Table No. 3, 
in the arrangement shown in the drawing. In 
this improved keyboard the proportion of di 
graphs participating in the lower bank of keys 
has been reduced to approximately 8%; the pro

portion of digraphs, participating in the upper 
bank, to approximately 22%. In these two equiv 
alent charts the relative frequencies of digraphs 
5 
are noted between the two keys involved. Those 
which are stroked by a single finger, or by partly 
ineffective adjacent fingers, or which require 
hurdles across a bank, are readily to be found. 
The charts thus map to an approximate degree 
much of the interference to be expected from 
keyboard relations. Upon the present "univer 
sal' keyboard the proportion of these less effec 
tive digraphs is approximately 28% of all di 
graph usage. Upon our new keyboard the pro 
portion is approximately 3% of all digraph usage.

While certain of the letters should not be other 
Wise located, to accomplish the advantages we 
have in view, the positions of certain others are 
Optional, and even in the controlling letters posi 
tions of certain ones can be interchanged. Those 
which should not be changed are e, t, o, a, h, n, i, 
and S, given in the order of their frequency of 
use. All these are found in the home row, the 
WOWels in One hand and the consonants in the 
other. To group all vowels in the home row, and 
in One hand, it is preferable that u be included 
With the others, and for advantage in effecting 
combinations of high frequency it is desirable that 
d be likewise included in the home row, though 
this displaces r and l, of somewhat greater fre 
quency. 
In order that high-frequency consonants shall 
ioe opposite the vowels with which they combine, 
and to group the most generally used consonants 
for operation by the more facile right hand, 
r, l, 20, f, m, c, b, g, and , in order of their relative 
frequency, are located in the upper and lower 
banks of the right hand. y and p, falling respec 
tively between f and m, and between g and v, 
are assigned to the left hand, because it facili 
tates the stroking, by opposite hands, of sequences 
of high frequency, as ly, ry, and pr. The location 
of these two letters, however, is not free from 
doubt, and especially they might be reversed in 
position. So, too, might if and g be reversed in 
position without material loss of facility. 
The remaining letters, k, i, ac, q, a, are of infre 
quent occurrence, and are assigned to the lower 
bank of the left hand. To avoid the awkward 
Single-finger sequence eac, which would occur if 
the letters were arranged in order of their rela 
tive frequency, the ac is displaced from the e, and 
k and i, of greater frequency, but less frequently 
combining with e, are displaced outwardly. The 
q, combining chiefly with u, is struck by a different 
finger. Bearing in mind these considerations, 
it is clear that the order of the letters a, q, j, k, ac, 
might be changed, and especially that a and q 
t 
be interchanged without increase of diffi 
Culty. 
Punctuation marks are positioned in accord 
ance with their frequencies relative to each other 
and to the letters. 
For left-handed persons it may be preferable to 
reverse the keyboard, but this is to be understood 
as within the limits of our invention. Further 
more, for languages other than English the posi 
tion of the particular letters will be widely varied, 
but arranged according to the principles which 
We have explained, it will still be found most suit 
able for the particular language involved. In 
the drawing it will be observed that certain keys 
are left blank, and these may be employed for the 
marks peculiar to a given language, such as the 
accent mark in French and the umlaut in German 
or for Such other characters as may be deemed de 
Sirable. 
Our keyboard arrangement has the following 
advantages: 
1. The keys are arranged in a manner based 
on a Scientific count of sequence frequencies in 
the Words used in Written language. 
2. Fewer common sequences require a difficult 
and awkward serial arrangement of finger mo 
tion (3% as compared with 28%). 
3. Fewer digraphs are typed with the same 
finger (1.3% as compared with 4.6%). 
4. Fewer digraphs consist of hurdles across 
banks by the same finger (.05% as compared 
with 2%). 
2,040,248 
5. A reduced number of Sequences is in the same 
hand. 
6. A reduced number of Sequences is in the left 
hand. 
7. A reduced number of digraphs involves both 5 
the fifth ang fourth fingers only of both hands 
(1% as compared with 3%). 
8. Fewer digraphs employ adjacent fingers, 
notably in hurdles across banks (.1% as compared 
with 5.5%). 
9. Fewer digraphs employ awkward adjacent 
finger reaches and hurdles (2.3% as compared 
With 20.4%). 
10. Remote-finger hurdles constitute about .2% 
of all frequencies as compared with 3%. 
11. Less than 20% (about 16%) of digraphs 
are assigned to include the lower bank (as com 
pared with 30%). 
12. Less than 40% (about 35%) of the digraphs 
are assigned to include the upper bank (as com 
pared with 86%). 
13. Approximately 67% of all digraphs are 
Stroked with opposite hands, as compared with 
48%. 
. 
14. Approximately 96% of the digraphs are as 
Signed to include the home row (as compared 
With 51%). 
15. Approximately 45% of the digraphs are 
confined to the home row only (as compared 
with 7%). 
16. Such digraphs as include different fingers 
in the same hand are in the main arranged for 
movement from Outer to inner fingers. 
17. The arrangement of key locations on the 
keyboard is made with reference to the adapta 
bility of hand skills to the sequence patterns of 
the Written language as determined by Scien 
tific, statistically adequate sequence-counts.
