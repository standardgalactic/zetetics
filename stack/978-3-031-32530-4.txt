To my husband Jon, with “love” as keyword

Preface
Why this book about the “keyword”? Today, keywords and their multiple uses serve to
bridge between the humanities and technology, between librarianship and information
science, between the searcher and the web resource, between the search engine and the
advertiser, between the social inﬂuencer and the audience, between the political strate-
gist and the voter turnout, and between our contemporary world and that of our ancient
predecessors. The keyword in its various guises (key word, concept symbol, hashtag, and
search term) can point not only to text and other forms of media, but to associated ways
of thinking and acting based on speciﬁc words that we may consider “key.”
This project is an effort to explore the rich history of the keyword from its earliest
manifestations (long before it appeared anywhere in Google Trends or library cataloging
textbooks) in order to illustrate its implicit and explicit mediation of human cognition
and communication processes, from its deictic origins in primate and proto-speech com-
munities, through its semiotic and symbolic instantiation in various physical artifacts and
structures, through its development within oral traditions, through its initial appearances
in numerous graphical forms, through its workings over time within a variety of indexing
traditions and technologies, to its role in search engine optimization and social media
strategies, to its potential as an element in the slowly emerging semantic web as well as
in multiple voice search applications. The purpose of the book is to synthesize different
perspectives on the signiﬁcance of this often-invisible intermediary, both in and out of
the library and information science context, and to understand how it has come to be so
embedded in our daily life.

Representation, Reference, Relevance,
and Retention
Like many of the words that matter most, that tell us
most about our intellectual and material life and about
our cognitive and perceptual habits, ‘keyword’ hides
in plain view. —Michael Leja, “Keyword” (2009)
Abstract
The long history of keywords and their predecessors as semiotic, symbolic, and seman-
tic pointers to key concepts over time is introduced. This chapter describes current
ﬁndings on four sensory speciﬁcs that are generally not considered as being aspects
of library and information science but that are keywords which ground the discipline
both physically and conceptually: that is, vision for representation, voice for reference,
hearing for relevance, and memory for retention.
While words in any natural language can serve as symbolic and semantic tools in indi-
vidual and social cognition, due to their ability to mobilize both abstract and concrete
concepts in representation and reference and even to immobilize these in various ways
for retention and retrieval over time, some of these verbal tools appear to be particularly
useful as keys to communication, maintaining and retaining their signiﬁcance for larger
groups of people and for longer periods of time. However, as Leja (2009) observes above,
the presence of these “key” words, especially in their functions as “keywords,” is largely
taken for granted.

Representation, Reference, Relevance, and Retention
1.1
Defining the Keyword
The Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnes “keyword” as either “a. A word that serves as the
key to a cipher or code” or “b. A word or idea that serves as a solution or explanation
for something; a word, expression, or concept of particular importance or signiﬁcance.”
Rosenberg (2021) in discussing these two deﬁnitions suggests that they are best rep-
resented today by the prevalence of keyword searching in search engines and by the
prevalence of polarizing terms in social discourse. His genealogy of the modern trajec-
tory for both deﬁnitions can be traced to 1958, the year in which IBM engineer Hans-Peter
Luhn (1958) published his method for automatically extracting and indexing “signiﬁcant”
words from scientiﬁc and technological articles and in which cultural theorist Raymond
Williams (1958) published his initial analysis of how particular words as used by indi-
vidual writers were the key to analyzing changes in cultural and social mores. These two
trajectories, the technological and the cultural, have coincided in today’s information envi-
ronment, to the point that, as Rosenberg says, “What makes keyword such a powerful idea
is precisely the ambiguity of the relationship that it mediates between what is informative
and what is signiﬁcant, a conundrum of our time if there ever was one” (Rosenberg 2021,
p. 121).
Bernard, in his history of the hashtag, which he calls the latest incarnation of the
keyword, dismisses most of these earlier incarnations, saying that “without a doubt the
category of ‘the keyword’ had occupied a rather inconspicuous place prior to the twenty-
ﬁrst century…Today, every Twitter feed and Instagram post provides further testimony to
the collective indexing or ‘keywording’ of the world” (Bernard 2019, p. 2).
In their encyclopedic examination of “keyword” and its related terms (term, index
term, free-text term, Uniterm, heading, subject heading, descriptor, concept symbol, tag,
word, stopword, N-gram, and keyphrase), Lardera and Hjørland (2021) provide an in-
depth intellectual background for the keyword in both library and information science
(LIS) theory and practice. Stubbs (2010, p. 25) has done the same for the discipline of
linguistics, arguing that “keyness is a textual matter” because “keywords are words which
are signiﬁcantly more frequent in a sample of text than would be expected, given their
frequency in a large general reference corpus.”
Nevertheless, the keyword has its origins in a much longer history than proposed
by these authors, so the rest of this chapter will explore the grounds on which our
understanding of “key” words should begin.
1.2
Grounding the Keyword
Clearly, before there can be “keywords,” there must be a conceptual and communicative
infrastructure in which any such coded or clear reference to or perceived relevance of
“something” (or, indeed, “anything”) can be meaningful enough to be memorable. Bruner

referred to all of these as “routes to reference” (Bruner 1998). It is well accepted by now
that evolutionary approaches to communication and information are necessarily inter-
twined, as both survival and reproduction require some successful internal and external
communication of information at every level of taxa, from the lower bacteriological levels
(Lyon 2015) to the higher zoological ones (Hoffecker 2013). In particular, the question of
the development of the human “faculty of language” (Hauser et al. 2002) can no longer
be considered in isolation from epigenetic (Gokhman et al. 2016), genetic (Graham et al.
2015), neural (Konopka and Roberts 2016), and other environmental (Greenhill 2016)
factors.
Changeux and his colleagues (2021) have proposed that seemingly minor changes in
the human genome since our fairly recent evolution from nonhuman primates can explain
fundamental features of human brain connectivity, especially the tripling in size of the
global neural architecture within the original primate brain, resulting in a larger number of
neurons and areas and the increased modularity, efﬁciency, and differentiation of cortical
connections. “The combination of these features with the developmental expansion of
upper cortical layers, prolonged postnatal brain development, and multiplied nongenetic
interactions with the physical, social, and cultural environment gives rise to categorically
human-speciﬁc cognitive abilities including the recursivity of language. Thus, a small set
of genetic regulatory events affecting quantitative gene expression may plausibly account
for the origins of human brain connectivity and cognition” (2021, p. 2425).
Worden (2022) suggests that the traditional notion of language evolution through
natural selection alone cannot account for the fact that the energy expenditure for our
language-enabled brain (roughly 20% of our metabolic requirements) is much too high in
comparison with that of a simpler brain with primitive language capabilities and smaller
metabolic costs, which would be both more efﬁcient and entirely adequate for our orig-
inal survival needs. He proposes instead that both natural selection and sexual selection
played a role in the evolution of language and intelligence, probably at different times.
Speciﬁcally, he theorizes that early language was driven by natural selection to facilitate
within-group collaboration. Early forms of information exchange, probably developed as
sounds and gestures in various hunting and gathering activities over time, along with an
emerging theory of mind, began to serve as markers for this superior intelligence, which
ultimately played a critical role in sexual selection for early man, as the qualities of empa-
thy and leadership it can embody are attractive to both peers and potential mates, thus
precipitating the unique reﬁnement of pragmatics, the development of spoken symbols,
and the construction of syntax which was eventually to become modern language. As it
does today, language acts as the main display mechanism for intelligence and also deter-
mines which “keywords” will become critically important in particular contexts, whether
it is the term for a prey animal or the name of a political party.
Within library and information science, this is consistent with today’s “information-
al” turn in which, despite some skepticism, such information-oriented scholars as Bates
(2022), Beynon-Davies (2011), Brier (2010), Madden (2004), O’Connor (1996), Shah

Representation, Reference, Relevance, and Retention
(2023), Spink (2010), and Stonier (1997) continue their interdisciplinary investigations
of what may quite reasonably be termed the evolution of information research. These
initiatives tend to stress the continuities and similarities among different forms of infor-
mationally oriented cognitive systems over space and time and to take a much wider
perspective than usual. They also tend to support the utility of a broader approach to the
information problematic, such as that posed by and through “keywords.”
Thinking about keywords as part of that problematic can raise central issues of rep-
resentation (that is, presentation and organization of data or information) and reference
(that is, meaning as intended by the speaker or writer), relevance (that is, meaning as
understood by the listener or reader), and retention (that is, the varied forms of internal
and external memory that may also be archived in both individual and social forms): all of
these are fundamental aspects of LIS. In the absence of words, would any of these exist?
Conversely, in their absence, might words still exist? This chapter explores some of the
current ﬁndings on systems, symbols, and speech that must necessarily (though invisibly)
ground any concept of “keywords.”
The biological systems necessary for representation, reference, relevance, and reten-
tion are usually taken for granted, as human beings are so used to our visual, oral, aural,
and retentive processing capabilities that it seldom occurs to us to wonder how these
are affecting what we see, say, hear, and remember, other than perhaps in thinking in
terms of extending these senses through novel technologies. Nevertheless, a knowledge
of some sensory speciﬁcs and their embodiment may be helpful in grounding this dis-
cussion, especially those related to the so-called “symbol grounding problem,” in which
the question is how any one thing can be connected to a meaningful interpretation of that
thing. This has been neatly expressed both by Searle (1980, p. 424) who observed “Of
course the brain is a digital computer. Since everything is a digital computer, brains are
too. The point is that the brain’s causal capacity to produce intentionality cannot consist
in its instantiating a computer program, since for any program you like it is possible for
something to instantiate that program and still not have any mental states. Whatever it is
that the brain does to produce intentionality, it cannot consist in instantiating a program
since no program, by itself, is sufﬁcient for intentionality”) and by Harnad (1990, p. 335)
who queried “How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made
intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads?”
As Barsalou (2016, p. 1129) put it, “To a large extent, grounding concerns itself with
the grounding problem raised initially by Searle and Harnad which asks how amodal sym-
bols, speciﬁcally, and cognition, more generally, are linked to the modalities, body, and
environment. In a review of research on grounding, Barsalou argued that researchers have
attempted to ground concepts and cognition by establishing their relations with modality-
speciﬁc systems, the body, the physical environment, and the social environment. …Thus,
at a general level, grounding simply refers to programmatically studying cognition in
new ways. Rather than studying cognitive mechanisms in isolation, establish their rela-
tions with the contexts in which they are embedded and on which they depend. At more

speciﬁc levels, grounding refers to establishing speciﬁc accounts of how cognitive pro-
cesses in the brain utilize the modalities, the body, and the environment. It does not mean
reducing concepts and cognition to anything, including sensory-motor mechanisms.”
1.3
Representation
Vision, for instance, enables us to represent the world. Pylyshyn (2000, p. 197) explains
that “Representations are the basic building blocks of cognitive explanations of human
behavior.... [and] function in the same way as descriptions: they use the conceptual
resources of the mind to encode properties of the world in much the same way as lan-
guage uses words... [but] a conceptual description alone (what Bertrand Russell called a
‘deﬁnite description’) is inadequate for encoding certain types of [physical] knowledge…
such as ﬁnding one’s way home. The most primitive contact that the visual system makes
with the world (the contact that precedes the encoding of any sensory properties) is a
contact with what have been termed visual objects or proto-objects.” Relatedly, Ballard
and his colleagues (1997) found that very minute eye and hand movements are linked by
processes underlying these elemental perceptual events through “deictic coding” to work-
ing memory, at time scales of approximately 1/3 of a second, and play an essential role in
the brain’s symbolic computations of “embodied” representations. Pitcher and Ungerlei-
der (2021) have proposed that on the lateral brain surface in the primate visual cortex, in
addition to the ventral visual pathway, which computes the identity of an object and the
dorsal visual pathway, which computes the location of an object and actions related to that
object, there exists a third visual pathway which computes the actions of moving faces
and bodies and is apparently specialized for the dynamic aspects of social perception.
Symbols are represented in our brains at different levels of complexity: at the initial,
simplest level, as physical entities, in the corresponding primary and secondary sensory
cortices, as conceptual ones. Symbols, however, no matter how simple their surface forms
may appear, evoke higher order multifaceted representations that are implemented in dis-
tributed neural networks spanning a large portion of the cortex. These internal states that
reﬂect our knowledge of the meaning of symbols are what we call semantic representa-
tions (Borghesani and Piazza 2017). Viganò and his colleagues (2021) showed that this
categorization within the brain took place in at least three representational stages: ﬁrst,
the sensory regions process the features relevant for categorization, the left angular gyrus
integrates the different sensory features into unique object identities, connecting them to
the correct name, and the hippocampus encodes the abstract associative rule.
The question of whether there might be a “language of thought” cognitive coding
that is separate from natural language, however, is still open, as opined by Mandelbaum
and his colleagues (2022): “Recent advances in deep neural networks appear to suggest
that there is no need for psychological models beyond ones that posit links between
neuron-like nodes. But while Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) research has moved away from

transparently interpretable, richly structured internal representations, advances in many
disparate areas of cognitive science suggest otherwise. Evidence from animal and infant
cognition, Bayesian computational cognitive science, unconscious reasoning, and visual
cognition suggests that the mind trafﬁcs in representations couched in an amodal code
with a language-like structure.”
1.4
Reference
Like other mammals, our common way of sharing a representation is by making a
vocal reference to it. (Pointing, the other referential method common in humans, is
uncommon among mammals, even among the great apes, though a few have been occa-
sionally observed using whole-hand gesturing to indicate a desired object from a human
companion).
The mammalian voice production organ has three subsystems: the pulmonary system,
which supplies power through the lungs, a sound generation system, typically the lar-
ynx, and a sound modiﬁer system, the (pharyngeal, oral, and/or nasal) vocal tract (Herbst
2016). It was once believed that a descended larynx was uniquely human, but it has now
been found in deer, for instance, though the human vocal tract still seems to be similar
only to those of the Neanderthals and the Denisovans (Dediu et al. 2021). Regardless
of languages and contexts, the amplitude modulation of the speech signal for humans
consists of a rhythm that ranges between 3 and 8 Hz, while the vocalizations and facial
expressions of monkeys and apes also have this rhythmic structure (Zhang and Ghaz-
anfa 2020). Human infants are attuned to this rhythm even prior to birth, which helps to
accelerate their process of language acculturation and accumulation (Ghio et al. 2021).
Although the abundance of sounds found in the world’s languages has been thought
to have been ﬁxed by biological constraints since the emergence of Homo sapiens, it has
recently been proposed that post-Neolithic changes in bite conﬁguration likely caused by
diet changes gave rise to a new class of speech sounds, the labio-dentals, produced by
positioning the lower lip against the upper teeth (Blasi et al. 2019). In general, vocal-
ization is undergoing intense study at present, especially the questions of communicative
exchange (Pika et al. 2018) and vocal learning (Vernes et al. 2021), as it becomes apparent
that human vocalization seems to have more in common with other bird and animal sound
emissions than earlier researchers believed. However, as Arbib (2021) notes, conveying
“aboutness” in general is an apparently uniquely human capability.

Relevance
Similarly, relevance, our ability to make use of articulated connections between the
world and others’ representations of it, is usually contingent upon the evolution of sound
localization in mammals. Hearing relies on existence of an evolutionarily ancient sound
recognition mechanism in the brainstem which is capable of implicit learning of sequences
of sound, which are integrated and streamed according to the spectrotemporal properties
of recognized sound sources, leading to enhanced auditory sensitivity to behaviorally rel-
evant sound sources. As mammals evolved in size, an accompanying increase in head
size brought both a larger larynx and an increase in the distance between the ears, which
favored evolutionary adaptations that helped to localize those cues indicating relevant
sounds or communication calls, as the tympanic ear is particularly adapted to transmit
low-frequency sounds via middle-ear bones (McLachlan and Wilson 2017).
Sound comprehension is also fundamental to communication, especially in perceiving
voices of members of the same species, and this ability is widely shared across the animal
kingdom. Neurophysiological work by Rauschecker and Scott (2009) used ﬁndings from
both humans and non-human primates to develop a model showing the connections of
structures in the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes linking vocal perception and pro-
duction. Chief among these were physiological and anatomical studies showing that the
primate auditory cortex, across species, shares the patterns of hierarchical structure, topo-
graphic mapping, and streams of functional processing that enable speech. Thus, speech
appears to be an extreme adaptation of vocalization common to many other species.
Bodin and Belin (2020) suggest the existence of a “voice patch system,” a network of
interconnected cortical areas providing a common template for the cerebral processing of
voices in primates. They argue that the left dorsal pathway is devoted to the processing of
complex sounds in monkeys as well in humans, but that the temporo-parietal regions of
the right hemisphere may have further evolved in humans to favor multimodal associations
and the processing of high-level social information that would support the development
of speech.
Speech comprehension in humans is complex, involving multiple stages of neural
representations in order to convert sound to meaning. The initial process involves spec-
trotemporal analysis of the acoustic signal in early auditory cortices, followed by phonetic
and phonological processing in the superior temporal lobe, in which continuous acoustic
features are projected into categorical representations. Higher levels of speech com-
prehension transform intermediate speech representations into conceptual and semantic
representations in the superior middle temporal lobe, while the posterior dorsal temporal
lobe, parietal operculum, and posterior frontal lobe are responsible for translating speech
signals into articulatory representations (Martin et al. 2019).

Representation, Reference, Relevance, and Retention
1.6
Retention
Retention, the storage and retrieval of memories within primate cognition, is also com-
plex, as it involves cognitive control, the executive and regulatory processes that allocate
attention, metacognitive processes that evaluate available information and seek additional
information when required, memory processes that draw on past experiences to plan future
behaviors, and self-control processes that deal with distractions and impulses when these
are threats to goal achievement (Beran et al. 2016).
Our human memory consists of several types, distinct from one another neurobio-
logically, functionally, and phenomenologically (Camina and Güell 2017). These include
sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory is very
brief (lasting for approximately one second) and includes information gathered through
sight (iconic memory), information gathered through hearing (echoic memory), and
information gathered through touch (haptic memory). Short term or “working” memory
includes a central executive which controls attention, an articulatory loop which retains
verbal information, and a visuospatial sketchpad which retains visual and spatial informa-
tion. Long-term memory includes explicit memory (which, as episodic memory, includes
conscious recall of episodic autobiographical memory, or, as semantic memory, includes
conscious recall of learned facts, events, or data), implicit memory (subconscious recall
of previously learned procedures or subconscious priming through previously experienced
emotions or interactions), and prospective memory (formation and implementation of
intended future actions).
Evidence from brain imaging research indicates that the human brain’s “default net-
work” for working memory is not signiﬁcantly different from those of other primates
(Buckner et al. 2008). As noted above, however, memory has different components, some
of which, such as autobiographical memory, are apparently unique to humans (Bjorklund
and Sellers II 2013), which foregrounds the human perception of time as opposed to that
of other creatures and which assists in supporting social memory within human groups.
1.7
Grounds for Key Concepts
All of these sensory systems, therefore, can provide the “grounds” for concepts. Car-
ruthers (2013, p. 238) says “The global broadcasting of attended sensory representations
in the brain is almost certainly an ancient adaptation, designed to coordinate the activity
of numerous higher cognitive systems around a common focus. …And we also know that
just as concepts are bound into the content of perception and globally broadcast along
with it (resulting in a state of seeing something as a car or as one’s mother, say), so are
concepts bound into the contents of visual and other imagery (resulting in an image of a
car, as such, or of one’s mother, as such)”.

1.7
Grounds for Key Concepts
9
According to Barsalou (2021), a concept develops by aggregating information from
perception, action, and internal states, and then using integration mechanisms to inte-
grate it with background situational knowledge already in memory. Although learning
plays central roles in establishing concepts, genetic and epigenetic processes constrain
the features that can be represented for a concept, and also their integration in the brain’s
association areas. Once the conceptual system is in place, it supports virtually all other
forms of cognitive activity, both in the current situation and when representing the world
in language, memory, and thought. The cortex’s activation of associations for concrete
and abstract concepts is still under investigation (Henningsen-Schomers and Pulvermüller
2022). Further, the sharing of concepts, whether through coded (Origgi and Sperber 2000)
or inferential (Smith 2008) transmission, is far from well understood, though there is
increasing interest in the cognitive sciences on shared cognition (Dingemanse et al. 2023),
conceptual alignment (Stolk et al. 2016), and joint epistemological engineering (Stolk
et al. 2022).
The discovery of mirror neurons (neurons within the brain that ﬁre both when the self
performs an action and when the self observes the same action performed by another)
in the brain of the macaque monkey created considerable excitement as to how these
might encode abstract concepts of actions which may then relate to imitation and other
forms of social learning in animals. For humans, brain activity consistent with that of
mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area,
the primary somatosensory cortex, and the inferior parietal cortex, also raising questions
regarding a possible innate ability of humans to imitate, learn from, and empathize with
others. However, studies involving the abilities of human (Oostenbroek et al. 2016) and
monkey (Simpson et al. 2014) newborns indicate that their imitations did not show any
patterns that would suggest the existence of innate imitative abilities by the infants of
either species, leaving social learning as the most probable explanation for these abili-
ties. Nevertheless, the human infant’s initial grasping abilities, then of reaching for more
distant objects, and later of showing and pointing as markers of shared attention, are all
considered signs of developing deictic capabilities, the ability to distinguish between self,
objects, and others, which will help to form the basis for language acquisition (Boundy
et al. 2016).
There are now various theories within cognitive science and cognate disciplines
attempting to “ground” new research in motor control, perception, and cognition into more
“embodied” approaches to thought (Gentsch et al. 2016) and language (García and Ibáñez
2016). Based on new ﬁndings that the brain’s hippocampal formation, anterior thalamus,
and claustrum provide rich, rapid coding of spatial representations, O’Mara and Aggleton
(2019) suggest that this may support the notion that the cognitive system uses both the
body and the environment as external informational structures in order to ground internal
representations. They note that the idea that the brain uses the external environment as
a kind of “cognitive surface,” or that it supports the structure of cognition has garnered
little attention in neuroscience to date but could offer productive areas of inquiry. This

may relate particularly to deixis, which, as Galbraith (2021) deﬁnes it, is “the semiotic
term for particularized space and time in embodied existence. This ever-present deictic
ﬁeld is both ordinary and unexplainable: how is it that this space and this body exist in
this moment? The elemental semiotic function of calling attention to particulars from the
perspectival orientation of a bodily self in time and space foregrounds such ineluctable
properties as presence, immediacy, and the vulnerability of being, and is a central topic
for philosophers, linguists, anthropologists, cognitive scientists, and literary theorists.”
In other words, the concepts of representation, reference, relevance, and retention are
instantiated in various ways that may be productive in considering these as “key” to the
development of all other systems, including biological systems, semiotic systems, and
information systems, which are essential to the creation of words, the symbolic key to
human understanding.
Even when speciﬁc languages have long been forgotten, it is still possible to recover
key meanings, as in the case of cuneiform (Robson 2019) and khipus (Hyland 2020). The
next chapter will explore the beginnings of semiotics, the study of semiosis (sign pro-
cesses) in all living beings, focusing on the importance of zoosemiotics and the challenges
that researchers face in understanding non-human primate communication.

Signals, Semiotics
Abstract
This chapter introduces semiotics, the study of signs, which includes signals as biolog-
ical communication among animals and words as abstract symbols among humans. It
focuses on zoosemiotics, the study of biological signals involving the various sensory
apparatus that animals possess, as they send, receive, process, and react to those signals
in different ways, emphasizing the communication behavior of non-human primates
which may be related to that of humans.
Semiotic communication has a far longer history than anything conveyed via words,
speech, or even sound, since the lowest so-called “semiotic threshold zone” begins with
bacteria quora employing chemical cues in communication (Van der Veer Martens 2023),
so any discussion of the origins of communication should begin with semiotics, the
study of signs, which is also inclusive of signals as biological communication (semio-
sis) among animals and words as abstract symbols among humans. This chapter will
focus on zoosemiotics, the study of animal signs and signals.
2.1
Introduction to Semiotics
Semiotics derives from sêma, the Greek word for sign, although the word itself did not
emerge from its Greek translation as “doctrine of signs” as brieﬂy mentioned in Locke’s
An Essay Concerning Human Understanding until a century later and has appeared in
several variants, usually as semiotics or as semiology (Nöth 1995). This study of signs as
indicative of various phenomena can be traced back to such early observers as Aristotle,
Lucretius, Hippocrates, and Augustine. There are numerous typologies of signs, but the

Signals, Semiotics
two dominant semiotic perspectives today originated in nineteenth century work by Fer-
dinand de Saussure in Switzerland, and by Charles S. Peirce in the United States, both
of whose works are still undergoing interpretation by scholars more than a century later.
This chapter will discuss Peircean semiotics while De Saussure’s semiotic contributions
will be discussed in Chap. 4. Peirce’s intellectual legacy to semiotics is both complex and
incomplete, as he left behind a massive collection of published and unpublished papers
still in the process of being edited and published as a multivolume critical edition (Keeler
2020).
The Peircean perspective is best known for Peirce’s introduction of the notion that
a sign stands for something or somebody in some respect or context. This three-way
relationship among the object (a phenomenon of some kind), the sign (that represents
the phenomenon in some way), and the interpretant (that translates into some meaning)
is essential to Peircean thinking, as each element is essential to the semiotic process. A
later version of his thinking further speciﬁed that the “sign” could relate to the object or
phenomenon in one of three general ways: it could share some particularly salient and
perceptible quality with it, in which case it is called an “icon,” or it could be seen as
symptomatic in some way of the phenomenon itself, in which case it is called an “index,”
or, if the conceptual connection could be viewed in some conventional way, it is called a
“symbol.”
An illustration of this in modern terms is as follows: a photograph taken by a security
camera of a person outside a building could be viewed as an “icon” of the particular
individual depicted, a large plume of smoke observed coming from inside that building
could be viewed as an “index” of a ﬁre within, and the name of someone suspected of
setting ﬁres in that area could be viewed as a “symbol” of potential arson. However, it
should be noted that all of these interpretations are independent of one another; there are
no necessary causal or correlative relationships involved in Peirce’s system, though there
are ample opportunities for inference and investigation (Eco and Sebeok 1988).
Peirce further developed the notion that these signs can be categorized in several addi-
tional ways, although his categorizations eventually became so complex, leading to a
total of 66 signs (Restrepo and De Mesa 2021), that only a few scholars draw upon the
extended versions. Most users of the Peircean perspective tend to use the less complicated
schemes, due to the simplicity of the approach and their applicability to a wide variety of
situations. In particular, the original interpretant element leaves unspeciﬁed any human
cognition in the translation process, unless the sign itself is a linguistic one, as famously
noted by Dewey (1946), while Millikan (2004) later pointed out that both humans and
animals are unable to interpret signs for which they lack any mental representations.
Among those who helped to further the Peircean perspective were English scholars
Ogden and Richards, whose graphic depiction of what they called the “symbol,” the
“referent,” and the “reference” in a “triangle of reference” in The Meaning of Meaning
(1927, p. 11) made semiotics much more widely known. The most popular modiﬁcation
of Peirce’s original model is arguably that of American linguist Charles Morris (1971),

2.1
Introduction to Semiotics

which includes (1) the “sign vehicle” (the object or event which functions as a sign), (2)
the “designatum” (the kind of object or class of objects that the sign designates), (3) the
“interpreter” (the individual for whom the sign vehicle functions as a sign), and (4) the
“interpretant” (the disposition of an interpreter to initiate a response sequence as a result
of perceiving the sign). This novel “stimulus–response” behaviorist approach also deﬁnes
a sign as any preparatory stimulus producing a disposition in the interpreter to respond to
something that is not an immediate stimulus. According to Morris, all signs may also be
divided into symbols, which can be interpreted to signify other signs, and signals, which
cannot. Morris’s model deviates sharply from that of Peirce but has been inﬂuential in
extending semiotic study into non-human semiosis.
Among Morris’s students was linguist Thomas Sebeok, whose application of aspects of
Morris’s integrated behavioral and semiotic model to his own investigations into the bio-
logical roots of culture (Sebeok 1963) became the foundation for the ﬁeld of zoosemiotics
(Maran 2014), and eventually more broadly for what has become known as biosemiotics,
which involves the study of the semiosis of all living beings (Favareau 2009). Sebeok
(2001) argued that biosemiotics could be used to analyze the cognitive and communica-
tive capabilities of other species as well as those of human beings, as behavior in all
biological organisms is indicative of semiosis, which is, fundamentally, activities based
on signs. In particular, analysis of the “signiﬁcation” of signs (which, however, accord-
ing to Morris, did not equate to “meaning” as generally understood by humans) could
be applied to the study of biological signals involving the various sensory apparatus that
animals possess, as they receive, process, and react to those signals in quite different but
clearly functional ways.
Sebeok also edited a volume on animal communication to which a fellow linguist,
Charles Hockett, contributed an important chapter, listing 16 “design features” of language
systems, inspired by the Shannon–Weaver model of information theory, and applied to
animal communication (Hockett and Altmann 1968). Hockett noted that all primate com-
munication systems include at least some of the following features: (1) a vocal-auditory
channel; (2) broadcast transmission and directional reception of sound; (3) rapid fading
of sound; (3) interchangeability of signals (members of the speech community can both
transmit and receive linguistic signals); (4) complete feedback (the speaker can hear what
is said); (6) specialization (the triggering consequences of signals are biologically impor-
tant; the energy costs of transmitting them are not; (7) semanticity (linguistic signals have
denotations that tie them to perceptions in and of the world); (8) arbitrariness (the rela-
tion between a meaningful element in a language and its denotation is independent of any
other resemblance between the two); (9) discreteness (possible messages in any language
constitute a discrete repertoire rather than a continuous one); (10) displacement (things
that are remote in time, space, or both from the site of the communicative transaction can
be referenced); (11) openness (new linguistic messages are easily created and, in context,
are usually understood); (12) tradition (language conventions are passed down by teaching

18

Signals, Semiotics
and learning, not through heredity); (13) duality of patterning (arbitrary but stable mean-
ingless signal-elements and also patterning in terms of minimum meaningful arrangements
of those elements); (14) prevarication (signals can be sent that are intentionally false or
without meaning); (15) reﬂexiveness (communication about the communication system
itself is possible); and (16) learnability (outsiders to the speech community can learn the
language).
This list was widely inﬂuential in the study of animal communication in the 1950s and
1960s, though, as Wacewicz and ˙Zywiczy´nski (2015) point out, Hockett’s set of design
features, with its focus on language as a product, emphasizing the code itself rather than
the cognitive abilities of its users, is incompatible with today’s research emphasis on the
study of those suites of sensorimotor, cognitive, and social abilities that may enable the
acquisition of language by biological creatures. It is still undetermined to what extent
these 16 communicative features are shared by different primate groupings, although it
remains an active topic of investigation (Amphaeris et al. 2022).
Zoosemiotics studies the biological signals involving the various sensory apparatus that
animals possess, as they send, receive, process, and react to those signals in different ways.
Ongstad (2021) lists these biological signals as auditory (such as vocalization, stridulation,
vibration, and chest beating) electric (both electrogenic and electro-receptive), olfactory
(chemical, scent marking, and scent rubbing), seismic (self-generated vibrations trans-
mitted through external substance), thermal (infrared, thermo-regulation), touch (ﬁghting,
mating, social integration, foraging, and huddling), and visual (gestures, facial expres-
sions, gaze following, color change, and bioluminescence). Von Uexküll’s (2001) concept
of animal umwelt (the animal’s perception of its environment) has also become highly
inﬂuential in zoosemiotics.
Zoosemiotics, combined with earlier ethological interest in the logic of animal commu-
nication (Marler 1961), interest in evolutionary approaches in the logic of natural selection
(Dawkins and Krebs 1978), and methods applied from game theoretic approaches to
signaling strategies (Maynard Smith 1982) have converged in the realization that these
separate approaches could be fused into a modern synthesis that combine proximate ques-
tions about how communication mechanisms such as signals serve to fulﬁll immediate
needs of the individual animals with ultimate questions about these mechanisms may be
favored by natural and sexual selection (Owings et al. 1997).
2.2
Studying Signals
Recent examples of biosemiotic research include the study of chemical signaling by ﬁsh
(Wisenden 2015) and of coloration communication among freshwater turtles (Brejcha
and Kleisner 2016). However, most attention has focused on the communicative behavior
of non-human primates, as their semiosis can be presumed to be closest to that of our
hominid ancestry. The distress calls of both human and non-human primate infants share

2.2
Studying Signals
19
a similar acoustic range and are adapted to elicit a similar range of more or less immediate
responses by their caretakers (Lingle et al. 2012). Recent studies in the communication
behavior of marmoset monkeys have shown that normal vocal development in monkey
infants can be inﬂuenced by parental feedback, potentially somewhat similar to the vocal
interactions between human parents and their infants (Ghazanfar et al. 2019).
Analysis of the much-studied vervet monkey genome indicates that their ancestral
branch diverged from that leading to hominid ancestry between 27 and 29 million years
ago (Warren et al. 2015) while that of the human–gorilla divergence is estimated to be
in the range of 9.4–12.2 million years ago, that of the human–chimpanzee divergence
in the range of 6.5–9.3 million years, and the divergence of bonobos from chimpanzees
approximately 1 million years ago (Moorjani et al. 2016).
The unusually clear alarm calls of the vervet monkey have been closely analyzed for
50 years (Price et al. 2015) to determine whether these calls represent instinctual responses
to a perceived stimuli and whether such calls routinely provoke particular behaviors in
other group members. Seyfarth, Cheney, and Marler’s work in the wild (Seyfarth et al.
1980) demonstrated that these alarm calls elicited behaviors in vervet group members
adaptive to the relevant predators: recipients of leopard calls climbed trees, recipients
of eagle calls hid within thick brush, and recipients of snake calls sought higher ground.
Experimental recordings of the calls elicited the same behavior by recipients, regardless of
the degree of caller arousal as indicated by acoustic variations in call length and volume,
showing that it was signal content rather than signal intensity that was important.
Seyfarth and Cheney (1993, p. 208) proposed that their vervet monkey results indicated
“some representation of the objects and events denoted by different call types and that [the
monkeys] compare and respond to vocalizations on the basis of these representations.”
Thus, the call both makes reference by the sender to a particular phenomenon, as shown
by its speciﬁcity, and is perceived as relevant by the call receivers, as shown by their
reactions. However, Evans and Clark (2010) noted that more compelling, comparative
evidence would be required to support such “representational signaling” as indicating the
presence of complex cognitive processes. Accordingly, researchers have tended to use the
neutral term “functional reference” to describe these types of communicative behavior as
it is evident, whatever the reason, that such calls do function to alert group members to
some presumably observed phenomenon, even though they may not be intended to be
“informative” in the human sense. In any event, Scarantino (2013, p. 1008) noted that
the vervet work “galvanized the ﬁeld of animal communication. It provided preliminary
support for what we may call the referential view of animal signaling, according to which
at least some animal signals refer to the external world.”
More broadly, Allen and Saidel (1998) relate functional reference to semiotics, sug-
gesting that functional reference may consists of different types: mimetic, proxy, and
conceptual reference. Mimetic reference consists of a signal closely resembling the ref-
erent so that it is capable of directly causing the same kind of response, equating to an
“iconic” sign. Proxy reference consists of a signal functioning as proxy for its referent

20
2
Signals, Semiotics
in the sense that the signal elicits the same kind of response that the referent would but
does so by a different cognitive mechanism, in contrast to mimetic reference which works
by stimulating the same sensory/cognitive pathways as the referent would, equating to an
“indexical” sign. Conceptual reference consists of signals that may refer to external con-
ditions without it being normal for such uses to elicit the responses that the referent itself
would elicit if it were present, equating to a “symbolic” sign. For instance, a mimetic ref-
erence signal might be the exaggerated sexual swellings of female baboons during their
peak periods of fertility, while proxy reference signals might include the vervet alarm
calls that alert to the presence of a particular predator, and conceptual reference signals
might include the “play face” that gorillas use to indicate non-aggressive intent during
casual physical interactions with their companions rather than the show of fully bared
teeth that would precede a serious attack.
Functional reference might presumably serve as a ladder of ascent to fully referential
communication, as both the behavior and the semiotic elements become more com-
plex. Referential communication is both anomalous in animal communication because
it involves context-dependent behaviors designed to inﬂuence speciﬁc addressees rather
than involving stable traits designed by natural selection to inﬂuence bystanders, and com-
plex, because these behaviors can carry multiple meanings, and these meanings can be
conveyed by a variety of behaviors (Stolk et al. 2015). Manser (2020) identiﬁes the differ-
ent types of referents in animal vocalizations as those associated with social factors (age,
dominance, group membership, sex, etc.), behavioral factors (contactual, emotional, and
motivational), and external factors (presence of food, predators, etc.). A growing body
of evidence attests to the prevalence of this vocal behavior among different species and
the different forms that it may take but the argument continues as to whether this does
(Arnold and Bar-On 2020) or does not (Fischer and Price 2017) have broader implications
in terms of the evolution of language within the primate lineage.
2.3
Gestural Repertoires
Vocal communication has been the primary focus of much of this research, but gestu-
ral communication has been found to be equally important among non-human primates.
According to Byrne and Cochet (2017), a biological repertoire consists of speciﬁc gestures
for speciﬁc meanings, and all apes have the innate potential to develop substantial reper-
toires. Studies show a large overlap in the species-typical gestural repertoires of all great
apes, approximately 90% overlap between chimpanzees and bonobos, approximately 80%
between chimpanzees and orangutans, and approximately 60% overlap between chim-
panzees and gorillas (Graham et al. 2022).This overlap is likely due to their common
descent, as mentioned earlier.
This repertoire includes the so-called “deictic” gestures or “pointing” behavior, which
is of particular interest due to its potential connection to the evolution of language and

2.3
Gestural Repertoires
21
to pre-linguistic behavior by human infants. According to Gillespie et al. (2013), gestural
communication among apes tend to involve dyadic (that is, indicating a partner) rather
than triadic (indicating a third entity) gesture and often carries an immediate, imperative
request such as for grooming or sharing food. However, pointing to objects has been
observed (Leavens et al. 2015). While the common human gesture of pointing with the
index ﬁnger is infrequently observed in ape behavior, whole hand pointing (or indicative
reaching) is used by captive apes when they have a receptive audience, though these
gestures tend to be imperative as well (Tomasello and Call 2019).
Liebal and Call (2012) found that gesture repertoires among great apes lack the
abstract qualities of human gesturing, and that their individual repertoires apparently
emerge from action via three potential pathways: genetic predispositions towards certain
species-speciﬁc ones, ontogenetic ritualizations that appear to pattern certain movements
in coordination with those of another conspeciﬁc, and social learning that may facilitate
the adoption of idiosyncratic or novel gestures.
Cissewski and Boesch (2016) observed that different great ape communities employ
similar gestures to convey different meanings. All of these ﬁndings regarding gestural
communication would seem to provide evidence regarding the development of early
human multimodal communication beyond that shown by great ape repertoires (Levin-
son and Holler 2014). An extensive review of the pointing literature by Krause and his
colleagues (2018, p. 339) concludes that “Early conceptions of pointing with the index ﬁn-
ger as a human species-speciﬁc gesture derived from our unique adaptations for language
have been revealed by subsequent research to be both cross-culturally and evolutionarily
inadequate to account for the full range of nonverbal referential capacities manifested by
a large range of vertebrate species.”
Leavens et al. (2009, p. 164) assert that “deixis, the ability to direct the attention
of another to a speciﬁc locus, is a shared capacity of great apes and humans. Because
deixis in great apes cannot ultimately derive from adaptations for bipedalism, proﬂigate
encephalization, or neurobiological or cognitive adaptations for speech, then this suggests
that our hominin ancestors were pre-adapted for joint attention, that joint attention is a
faculty of ‘language’ in a broad sense (shared by humans and other animals).”
Although Tomasello and Call (2019, p. 467) conclude from these and other consider-
ations that “although great apes do understand about directing the attention of others to
things, they do not understand reference in human-like ways because human reference is,
in effect, an invitation to share attention … The deepest underlying issue that differen-
tiates great ape gestural communication from human gestural communication, therefore,
is cooperation. Great apes are essentially communicating in order to fulﬁll individual-
istic goals—and they understand others to be doing this as well—whereas humans are
communicating cooperatively in the context of joint goals and joint attention,” this may
be altered by new research, for example, into the nature of vocal communication during
cooperative hunting by wild chimpanzees (Mine et al. 2022) and of declarative referential
gesturing by wild chimpanzee pairs (Wilke et al. 2022).

22

Signals, Semiotics
However, the view of Wheeler and Fischer (2012) still appears to be valid: that even
the most sophisticated ape signals appear to be at the stage of Dennett’s “ﬁrst order inten-
tionality” in which the signal is intended to alter the immediate behavior of the receiver,
though the sender’s intent may not be a conscious one, rather than at the second stage,
in which the sender intends to alter the receiver’s actual knowledge state rather than any
immediate behavior. They then suggest that “context-speciﬁc signals” would be a more
useful term, as the investigation of ecologically based factors surrounding the development
and use of various calls in particular species shows that the physical and social environ-
ment may have a much more direct impact on these than previously realized. Rendall
and colleagues (2009) argue that exerting inﬂuence rather than exchanging information
may well be the underlying “goal” of animal communication, while Scarantino (2010)
believes that the broader term “functional signaling” should continue to be used by ani-
mal communications researchers without any implications regarding sender intentionality.
Sievers and Gruber (2016) propose instead that researchers turn to actual situations of ani-
mal signaling and adopt a pragmatic approach of identifying speciﬁc “acts of reference,”
with a focus on the signaler and whether it intentionally produces a referential signal
with the goal of modifying audience behavior. Liebal and her colleagues (2022) lament
the fact that multimodal communication research in primate communities continues to be
uncommon, despite the fact that analyzing the combination of facial, gestural, and vocal
manifestations is a routine method of research in understanding human communication
and could well be applied in studying our fellow primates.
Relatedly, researchers continue to disagree to what extent “theory of mind” or “per-
spective taking” appears among different species of non-human primates in the wild
(Royka and Santos 2022). Some research suggests that certain apes do have cognitive
abilities that might accurately termed be “beliefs” and “plans” related to their environ-
ment. For example, female chacma baboons are known to engage in a variety of proactive
strategies to protect their nursing young from potentially infanticidal males in their own
and neighboring troops (Palombit 2015), and wild orangutan males communicate their
intent to travel by speciﬁc calls to conspeciﬁcs up to a day in advance of any actual move-
ments (van Schaik et al. 2013). However, research also indicates that non-human primates
cannot identify the truth or falsity of a belief held by another if it differs from their own
(Martin and Santos 2016). Kano and his colleagues (2020) contest this, saying that the
evidence of failure is largely due to experimental design issues, as the so-called false
belief test, originally applied to human children, does not adequately control for nonhu-
man primates’ cognitive differences and their experiments indicate that chimpanzees can
pass appropriate false belief tests, arguing that much more research on non-human theory
of mind is necessary.
Bermúdez (2007) has theorized that while nonlinguistic creatures are unable to apply
formal rules of inference deﬁned over propositions, since they lack the public language
required to think about thoughts, they are able to make certain rational causal connections
between pairs of contrary concepts in a form of proto-inference, though they are obviously

unable to describe the inferential process itself. This is exempliﬁed in the many studies
of problem-solving by nonhuman primates and by human infants (Hopper 2010). In the
case of human infants, who will eventually achieve linguistic competence, it also supplies
the initial scaffolding necessary to ascend to logical thought over time.
These issues are integral to developing a fully human “theory of mind,” which is the
ability of both speakers and listeners to make attributions about one another’s beliefs,
knowledge, and other mental states, and is theoretically inherent in all forms of human
communication as it is pragmatically what connects speaker reference and listener rele-
vance (Sperber and Wilson 1986). Even though enculturated apes raised in human-created
environments that support their learning of symbolic communication systems show some
evidence of sophisticated usage of imperative signs (Rivas 2005), deictic signs (Lyn et al.
2014), and even declarative signs (Lyn et al. 2011), they usually conﬁne their usage to
requests for particular objects and actions, rather than engaging in the type of exploratory
communicative interactions common in human children beyond the age of two or three
years. This is thus a less telling source of evidence for the actual evolution of proto-
language, given the unnatural nature of the experimental environment as opposed to
non-human primate interactions in the wild, which are obviously much richer and unstruc-
tured as shown by the observational studies that have been made over time (Leavens et al.
2009).
More broadly, it has been argued that there has been undue emphasis by researchers
on deﬁning cognition from a purely human point of view and that there are undoubtedly
certain cognitive skills that other animals have evolved to perform better than humans,
but these have been both under-valued and under-researched (Bräuer et al. 2020), as are
the dimensions of animal consciousness in general (Birch et al. 2020), while the cogni-
tive and communicative potential of non-human primates today remains a matter of both
ethical and legal concern (Benvenuti 2016). Obviously, non-human primates have evolved
in a different direction than humans in terms of their cognitive and communication capa-
bilities, so the next chapter will focus on the fossil hominin record in order to further
explore the development of vocal and gestural deixis into some form of proto-language,
the unknown communication system that over millennia was to become modern speech.

Proto-Signs, Proto-Words
Abstract
This chapter reviews some of the more important scenarios for language evolution,
including Bickerton’s “power scavenging” hypothesis and Chomsky’s “Merge” hypoth-
esis, all of which attempt to theorize the emergence of the earliest “proto-words” and
“proto-signs,” the potentially multiple communicative variants using speech and/or ges-
tures that may have been developed by the small, scattered human groups existing long
before any known proto-language became dominant enough to leave traces in modern
language.
Christiansen and Kirby (2003) call the evolution of language “the hardest problem in
science” largely because, as has often been said, “language does not fossilize” (Botha
and Everaert 2013, p. 1). Any inferences about language evolution must be made from
very different sources of evidence, not only the communicative behavior and cognition
of living non-human primates and other animals as discussed in the previous chapter,
but those genes believed to be involved in human language and speech, and the fossil
remains of prehistoric hominins and associated artifacts. There have been a number of
different initial evolution of language scenarios offered during the past several decades,
but adducing empirical evidence in support of these theories has only recently become
prevalent (Wacewicz and Zywiczynski 2017). Fitch (2017, p. 3) comments that “there is
an increasing amount of relevant data allowing empirical evaluation of such models.…The
key challenge facing the study of language evolution is not a lack of data, but rather a
weak commitment to hypothesis-testing approaches and strong inference, exacerbated by
the broad and highly interdisciplinary nature of the relevant data.”

3.1
Proto-World
Lameira and Call (2020) explain that language evolution researchers are broadening their
focus: “Fifteen million years ago, unlike today, the world was inhabited by multiple and
contemporaneous hominid species, of which at least 22 are recognized extinct genera,
excluding the direct ancestors who would become genus Homo. Given how improba-
ble fossilization is, numbers were beyond doubt much larger than what the fossil record
shows. Besides ourselves, the only surviving traces of this diversity nowadays are the
seven (nonhuman) great ape species alive today, three orangutan, two gorilla, one chim-
panzee, and one bonobo species, comprising three genera, Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan,
respectively. Each extant great ape lineage diverged at different times from the one that
eventually gave raise to Homo. Pongo was the ﬁrst lineage to diverge, Gorilla the second,
Pan the last. This is reﬂected in the level of genetic similarity between each great ape
genus and humans, as well as their taxonomy… Acknowledging the diversity and vari-
ance of great ape traits (and more generally across animal taxa) that contributed to shape
cognitive and linguistic evolution will help make new strides in the effort of reconstructing
the evolutionary timeline of language.”
This chapter brieﬂy reviews some of the more important scenarios and evidence that
connect them to the inferences made by different scenarios about developments that may
have led to the earliest “proto-signs” and “proto-words,” both of which belong to what has
been called “Proto-World,” which is alleged to be that period approximately 100,000 years
prior to the emergence of what historical linguists, somewhat confusingly, also call “proto-
languages,” meaning those earliest identiﬁable languages such as Proto-Afro-Asiatic and
Proto-Indo-European which preceded the emergence of languages in their modern forms.
“Proto-World” is, of course, only a metaphor, which covers multiple possibilities: that
human language was a unique “saltationist” event that eventually came to affect all human
populations, or that multiple communicative variants using speech and/or gestures repeat-
edly emerged due to various factors but became extinguished among the small human
groups that occupied various continents over the millennia before any known historical
proto-language became dominant enough to leave traces, or that some still unknown series
of events was the catalyst for human language.
Arbib (2005a, 2005b) describes a proto-language as a system of utterances used by
a particular hominin species (possibly including Homo sapiens), which could be rec-
ognizable as precursor to human language but which is not itself a human language
in the modern sense. He deﬁnes “proto-language” as a system of communication using
“proto-signs” or “proto-words” whose meaning can be established within a community by
conventionalization (and in this sense is open-ended) but which has little or no grammar.
In contrast, a true language has a large and open-ended stock of words (the lexicon) and
a grammar which supports both familiar and novel combination of words into meaningful
patterns that comprise phrases and sentences in that language (compositional semantics).

3.1
Proto-World
31
It should be emphasized that most contemporary linguists are dismissive of efforts to
hypothesize the initial emergence of language in this way, given their discipline’s adher-
ence to a form of uniformitarianism (the principle originally articulated by Lyell in regard
to geological processes) that any natural processes must be observable in the present in
order to hypothesize that they operated similarly in the past) for the study of language
in general. Further, given that the rate of change in language over time is very high, and
the risk of accidental similarities in comparing various words from different languages
being seen as signiﬁcant ones is also very high, no traces of a “Proto-World” origin for
any word can reasonably be expected to be found in any known language. (See Campbell
and Poser (2008) for an extensive discussion of these issues.) Nevertheless, while there
may be no direct bridge between proto-words in Proto-World and any known language
today, it is likely that certain of our key contemporary concepts, such as family, ﬁre,
food, and fornication, would have survived over the millennia, even though their original
expressions have not.
Although no specimens of prehominin or early hominin vocalizations exist, it is clear
that modern human cognition and communication must have been enabled by the devel-
opment of particular genetic and physical capabilities to support them, so the genetic
and paleoanthropic ﬁndings from both extinct and very early modern hominins are useful
in assessing different theories regarding these (Lieberman 2016). Similarly, even though
genetic analysis indicates that chimpanzees and bonobos have diverged about as much
from the common human-chimpanzee ancestor as have humans (Wildman et al. 2003)
and even that substantially more genes underwent positive selection in the chimpanzee
lineage than in the human lineage, suggesting more adaptive genetic changes during chim-
panzee evolution than during human evolution (Balzeau et al. 2014), some inferences can
reasonably be made from data regarding their genetic and morphological data as well.
Approximately 99% of human DNA is similar to that of the chimpanzees and bonobos
with whom we shared a common ancestry roughly 13 million years ago, and even more
with the Neanderthals and Denisovans with whom humans shared ancestry 600,000 years
ago, so the genetic ﬁndings that the FOXP2 gene, which is required for normal devel-
opment of speech and language, although present in all lineages, acquired two amino
acid substitutions (N303 and S325) after the split of hominids from their common ances-
tor with chimpanzees, suggesting that the two gene changes might have contributed to
the development of hominin linguistic abilities (Mozzi et al. 2016). The version of the
FOXP2 transcriptional factor that is shared by humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans
enhanced synaptic connectivity and malleability in these neural circuits. Tiwary (2020)
has recently reported ﬁndings that the FOXP2 gene may have coevolved with 6 neighbor-
ing genes (DGKQ, KLF10, HSPBP1, RIMS1, TAC3, and PRUNE) to produce the cognition
necessary for human speech.
As Tallerman (2006) points out, though the common ancestor of chimp and human
at around 5–6 million years ago had a vocal tract, tongue and lips and glottis, ears, and
much else besides that have been co-opted for speaking and listening, speech (production,

perception, and the neural mechanisms supporting it) itself is not language, which must be
learned. However, studies in humans and a small number of other species have provided
insights into the neural and genetic basis for learned vocal communication and are helping
to delineate the roles of brain circuits across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in
generating vocal behaviors (Konopka and Roberts 2016).
The cerebellum, widely thought to play a critical role in the executive functions of
both cognition and motion (Mariën et al. 2014), is also large in ancestral apes, suggesting
that the initial impetus for this may have been to improve branch locomotion and route
planning, and may have later helped in the development of both technologically and
socially complex behaviors. Additional cerebellular specializations may have contributed
to planning and comprehension, and may also have laid foundations for syntactical aspects
of language (Barton 2012). It is notable also that the very different conﬁgurations of
tongue, palate, larynx, and dentition in the modern human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan
would tend to preclude the development of identical vocalization assemblages, though
there is growing consensus that the latter two also had developed language capabilities
(Progovac 2016).
3.2
Theories of Language Evolution
Given the above background, various theories that have represented the diversity of
thought about language evolution over the past several decades are of particular inter-
est here. These fall into two general categories, focusing primarily on the importance
of communication or of culture, though many include elements of both perspectives.
Among the communication-centric theories are those of Michael Arbib, Derek Bicker-
ton, Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth, Noam Chomsky, Michael Studdert-Kennedy
and Louis Goldstein, and Jordan Zlatev. The culture-centric theories include those of Ter-
rence Deacon, Merlin Donald, Robin Dunbar, Dean Falk, James Hurford, Steven Mithen,
and Thom Scott-Phillips.
3.3
Communication-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
Arguably the best-known communication-centric theory of language evolution is that of
Chomsky (2010), whose “Merge” hypothesis about the emergence of language, part of
his so-called “Minimalist program,” which proposes that grammatical recursion is the
minimum characteristic of the faculty of language, and that it was the result of a single
human mutation sometime within the past 100,000 to 60,000 years. Rather than suggesting
a gradual transition from any form of proto-language, Chomsky’s hypothesis continues to
posit an unprecedented, immediate leap into modern language.

3.3
Communication-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
33
No trace of this has been found in genetic drift as yet, though Benítez-Burraco and
Uriagereka (2015) have suggested the possibility of a link to ancient viral vectors and
their potential epigenetic impact on a developing immune system and brain, and Fujita
(2009) has proposed that “Merge” evolved from a preexisting capacity for hierarchical
and sequential object combination as typically observed in tool using and tool making.
Huybregts (2017) offers an alternative suggestion for the existence of “Merge”: that the
capacity for internalized language (“Merge”) existed internally before human populations
became separated, but that externalized language (speech) only emerged after that sepa-
ration. He gives the example of the Khoisan “click” languages that are only found among
biologically Khoisan peoples as empirical support for Chomsky’s “Merge” hypothesis.
Many non-Minimalists, however, ﬁnd “Merge” unconvincing in light of growing evi-
dence that the various shifts that eventually enabled language were more gradual and less
dramatic than the Minimalist program appears to allow (Botha 2011). Murphy (2019)
notes that there exist 1,241 primate-speciﬁc genes, 280 of which are human-speciﬁc.
Fifty-four percent of these human-speciﬁc genes are upregulated in the prefrontal cortex,
a brain area implicated in higher cognition. Given this level of regulatory complexity,
Murphy considers it most likely that the neurocomputational properties required for lan-
guage emerged after the mutation of multiple regulatory genes acting in concert rather
than through a singular mutational event such as “Merge.”
Such a more gradual timeline is offered by the “Mirror System Hypothesis,” which is
founded on the idea that mechanisms which support language in the human brain evolved
atop a basic mechanism not originally related to communication (Arbib 2017; Rizzo-
latti and Arbib 1998). Instead, the mirror neuron system for grasping, with its capacity
to generate and recognize a set of actions, provides the evolutionary basis for language
parity (that is, that an utterance means roughly the same for both speaker and hearer).
In particular, the Broca’s area in humans contains, but is not limited to, a mirror sys-
tem for grasping, which is homologous to that seen in the macaque. Arbib proposes that
Homo habilis through to early Homo sapiens had a proto-language based primarily on
manual gestures (“proto-sign”), which provided the essential scaffolding for the emer-
gence of a proto-language based primarily on vocal gestures (“proto-speech”), but that
the hominin line saw advances in both proto-sign and proto-speech feeding off each other
in an expanding spiral so that proto-sign did not attain the status of a full language prior to
proto-speech. The claim is that the demands of an increasingly spoken proto-vocabulary
then provided the evolutionary pressure that yielded a vocal apparatus and corresponding
neural control to support the human ability for rapid production and co-articulation of
phonemes that underlie human speech.
Arbib also advances the notion of proto-words as individual holographic units that
represent complex propositions, more like whole modern sentences, from which “true”
language developed. He supports this by suggesting aspects of “language-readiness” sup-
ported by hominin brain mechanisms that evolved prior to the emergence of language.

Proto-Signs, Proto-Words
These aspects include complex action recognition and complex imitation; intended com-
munication; symbolization; parity (that is, what counts for the producer of one or more
symbols must count, frequently, as approximately the same for the receiver of those sym-
bols, extending the role of the mirror neurons for grasping and other actions by “lifting”
complex imitation from praxis to communication); the perception of hierarchical structure
of scenes to determine what actions to execute and when to execute them to achieve their
goals; the ability to recall past events or imagine future ones; a prolonged period of infant
dependency, especially pronounced in humans, combined with the willingness of adults
to act as caregivers and the consequent development of social structures to provide the
conditions for complex social learning; symbols becoming words in the modern sense,
interchangeable and composable in the expression of meaning; the matching of syntactic
to semantic structures growing in complexity, with the nesting of substructures making
some form of recursion inevitable; verb tenses or other tools expressing the ability to
recall past events or imagine future ones; and, ﬁnally, to qualify as a human language,
much of the syntax and semantics of a human language must be learnable by most human
children.
Criticism of proto-words as individual holographic units centers around the apparent
contradiction that the segmentation it depends on can only work if both signals and mean-
ings contain sub-units, yet these holographic units by deﬁnition are unitary, unstructured
utterances that do not easily lead to the combinatorial complexity required for evolution
into modern languages (Tallerman 2007).
Another communication-centric theory, that of “particulate language,” is based on
the existence of a neuroanatomical system of independently movable parts that can be
coordinated to produce rapid sequences of motor actions that can result in articulation
(Studdert-Kennedy and Goldstein 2004). Speech is a motor function that draws on ancient
mammalian oral capacities, notably sucking, a deﬁning mammalian behavior, which pre-
sumably began the neuroanatomical differentiation of the mammalian tongue, culminating
in its usage for calls and cries, and eventually for the hominin proto-syllable, precursor
of the modern child’s unit of babble and the modern adult’s unit of rhythm and melody.
This theory views the early proto-syllable as a gesture, since it involves the constriction
and release of one of the vocal organs. Once these vocal gestures had evolved as discrete,
combinable units, the expansion of “particulate language” could have occurred through
a process of mutual attunement between individual and eventual communal speakers/
hearers without any further genetic change. The “particulate” theory of language, there-
fore, hypothesizes the eventual precipitation of these gestures and sounds into further
processes of actual acculturation.
A theory based on bodily mimetic behavior also focuses on gestural evolution from
a cognitive semiotic perspective, suggesting that pantomime formed the original human-
speciﬁc communication system through the emergence of iconic representation through
mimicry, dominated by bodily gestures for enactment and supported by expressive vocal-
ization and facial expressions (Zlatev et al. 2020). This represents a ﬁnal stage of mimesis,

3.4
Culture-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
35
as earlier stages (proto-mimesis as expressed by neonatal mirroring, dyadic mimesis as
expressed by object movement re-enactment, and triadic mimesis as expressed through
the imitation of sign use) have all been observed to some extent in apes (Zlatev et al.
2005).
Perniss and Vigliocco (2014) have urged a similarly semiotic framework in which
this iconicity in face-to-face communication (spoken and signed) serves as a powerful
vehicle for bridging between human sensorimotor experience and language. They claim
that iconicity might have played a key role in establishing displacement (the ability of
language to refer beyond what is immediately present) and in supporting referentiality
(learning to map linguistic labels to objects, events, etc., in the world), and in providing a
mechanism to account for how language comes to be embodied (grounded in our sensory
and motor systems), which is core to meaningful communication.
3.4
Culture-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
The communication-centric theories, however, do not explain what might have precip-
itated the necessity for more sophisticated semiotic functioning among early hominins.
Bickerton’s (1990, 1995, 2014) theory for the origins of proto-language presents such
a need, speculating that “power scavenging” was necessitated by a dramatic change in
habitat from jungle to savanna during the early African migration period. The ability of
these small groups to search for available animal carcasses and effectively communicate
their whereabouts to others, then successfully distract larger predators from these kills,
and eventually to compete as groups of hunters with other predators for their prey cre-
ated an ecological niche that, in turn, facilitated the development of a proto-language that
emphasized observation, tracking, and coordination of these activities.
Since contemporary chimpanzees also sporadically engage in group hunting activities
(Moore et al. 2017), it is likely that early hominins did the same. MacDonald and Roe-
broeks (2013) have argued that a reduction of information search costs in ﬁnding prey
animals by this common knowledge of animal behavior, communicated with mimicry,
natural gestures, and a small vocabulary would have signiﬁcant survival advantages.
Bickerton proposed a “compositional” approach: that is, that the proto-language must
have contained a small set of easily expressed sounds with simple meanings expressing
basic cognitive concepts, which could be called the “ancestors” of modern nouns and
verbs. He ﬁrst proposed proto-language as an intermediate stage between a non-linguistic
state and a fully ﬂedged modern language and suggests, moreover, that proto-language
still exists in the human brain, only resurfacing when normal linguistic development fails.
Each word in this proto-language refers to a single, simple concept, and although these
could have been concatenated together in a “slow, clumsy, ad hoc stringing together of
symbols” (1995, p. 65), Bickertonian proto-language is always characterized as “a lexicon
without syntax” (1995, p. 51).

36

Proto-Signs, Proto-Words
One weakness of this theory is that it is unlikely that the so-called “displaced refer-
ence” (the ability to refer to something that is not immediately visible, which Bickerton
identiﬁes as the key driver behind successful power scavenging groups) could have been
the only factor at work in the development of a proto-language, given that this does not
account for the maternal transmission of general “displaced reference” skills to infants,
which is the primary means of such skill development in humans. It is of course possible
that, like other, later hunter-gatherer groups, both hunting and foraging survival required
the ability to locate and describe especially suitable food sources to other members of the
group, which would allow infants to pick up this ability by observation and imitation as
well. Szilágyi and colleagues (2023) note that the synergistic ﬁtness advantage provided
by these several components of the scavenging-speciﬁc hypothesis could have evolved
more readily in combination rather than in isolation.
Cheney and Seyfarth’s theory regarding the evolution of language, based on their
extensive research among non-human primate communities, especially the importance of
member knowledge of dominance hierarchy and kinship, proposes that (2010, pp. 294–
295) “Gestural communication, including pointing and pantomime, combined with a few
vocalizations representing key concepts such as kinship or danger would sufﬁce for much
of the proposed protolanguage. We suggest, then, that long before our ancestors spoke
in sentences, they had a language of thought in which they represented the world—and
the meaning of call sequences—in terms of actors, actions, and those who are acted
upon. The linguistic revolution occurred when our ancestors began to express this tacit
knowledge, and to use their cognitive skills in speaking as well as listening. The prime
mover behind this revolution was a theory of mind that had evolved to the point where
its possessors did not just recognize other individuals’ goals, intentions, and even knowl-
edge—as monkeys and apes already do—but were also motivated to share their own
intentions, beliefs, and knowledge with others... It also provided the selective pressure for
the evolution of the physiological adaptations that enabled vocal modiﬁability. Whatever
the selective pressures that prompted this change, the complex suite of skills that we call
human speech built upon mental computations that had their origins and foundations in
social interactions.”
The most obvious criticism of Cheney and Seyfarth’s “social interactions” theory is
that, without additional evidence, contemporary ape interactions in the wild cannot pro-
vide sufﬁcient justiﬁcation for theories about hominid branches that diverged from a
common ancestral ape millions of years ago. Nevertheless, their empirical contributions
are clearly relevant and cannot readily be discounted as evidence for or against other
theories.
Among the acculturation theories is Deacon’s theory about the evolution of language,
based on the notion that symbolic thinking triggered a co-evolutionary exchange between
languages and brains over two million years of hominin evolution (Deacon 1998). He
argues that the ﬁrst symbolic communication evolved as a way for long-term, sexually
exclusive pair bonds to co-exist with cooperative group foraging, which became a critical

3.4
Culture-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
37
factor when hunter-gatherer activities became more prevalent in a changing climate, as
shown by the increase in stone tools and fossilized bones of other animals within prehis-
toric archaeology sites. The theory proposes that the natural instincts of males to ensure
that they would have exclusive access to sexually receptive females and the instincts of
females to ensure an adequate food supply for their offspring created an effective repro-
ductive strategy in which mating became a symbolic social contract recognized by the
group. This symbolic social contract, initially involving a very small symbolic domain,
mediated by a more or less typical primate repertoire of non-symbolic vocal, olfactory,
and gestural displays of afﬁliation toward the mate and aggression toward interlopers,
was what provided a signiﬁcant selective advantage through increased offspring survival
over time to the majority of those who employed it. The development of kinship systems
enabled by this initial level of monogamy may also have helped to promote group survival
(Schacht and Kramer 2019).
Another culturally oriented theory is that of Donald (1991) whose argument regarding
the evolution of the modern mind is that the so-called “mimetic culture” of early hominins
was founded on the ability to provide conscious, self-initiated, representational acts that
serve a variety of purposes, from self-reﬂection, to skill rehearsal, to social communica-
tion. Donald makes the provocative suggestion that, in fact, the rudiments of culture must
have preceded and laid the foundations for the development of symbolic cognition:
Although our brains have undoubtedly evolved a capacity for symbolic thought, this capacity
is only vaguely deﬁned in the nervous system itself. The brain is not, on its own, a symbolizing
organ. The brain depends entirely on culture for the exploitation of its symbolic capacity, and
some of its most impressive functions have a purely cultural origin. Symbolizing minds, as
we know them, are not self-sufﬁcient neural devices, as are eyes. They are hybrid products of
a brain-culture symbiosis. Without cultural programming, they could never become symbol-
izing organs. They would become something else, very powerful perceptual-motor systems,
like those of a superprimate, perhaps, but not truly symbolic. . .Unthinkable as it may seem,
we are not even certain that spoken language, as we know it, was part of our primordial pro-
ﬁle as a species. We have no ﬁrm empirical evidence by which we can dismiss the notion that
language itself might be, especially in some of its most esoteric semantic and grammatical
features, just another product of our deep symbiosis with culture (2000, pp. 22–25).
Increasing interest in what is being termed “animal culture” lends some support to
Donald’s suggestion, as research shows that there is a wide continuum of social learn-
ing behaviors among various species that can correctly be called some form of cultural
transmission that are apparent in such behavioral domains as foraging techniques, mate
selection, migratory pathways, nesting sites, preferences for particular prey, tool use, and
vocal communication, though these are much less complex than those of human culture
(Whiten 2021). Since language clearly is not necessary for these social learning behaviors
to occur within animal groups, it is quite possible that such forms of early hominin culture
did precede any spoken language, though the evaluation of such evidence is contingent
upon one’s deﬁnition of “culture.”

38

Proto-Signs, Proto-Words
Any use of proto-words by early hominins, therefore, was likely to have begun as sub-
sidiary to gestural communication and to focus the attention of the group on immediate
matters of survival, such as the location of seasonal food sources, and associated problem
solving, such as crossing difﬁcult terrain. However, this quite probably also offered the
opportunity for “bootstrapping” the group’s cognitive and communicative abilities over
generations. Lock (1999, page 347) observes that “interaction constructs contexts that
language can come to symbolize, thereby providing a cognitive technology that boot-
straps the increasing discovery of those ‘things’ that are implied by what has already
been symbolised.” In particular, this presents the possibility of increasing the group’s
communicable store of shared memories, which could improve group problem-solving
abilities and also represent an advance over what Donald terms “the episodic culture” of
non-human primates, which deﬁnes their inability to focus attention beyond a very limited
span of time, and an approach toward mimetic culture.
Falk’s theory of the evolution of language (2007) hypothesizes that the vocal substrates
for proto-language had prosodic features similar to contemporary so-called “motherese,”
which evolved as the enlarging brains in early hominins made birthing more difﬁcult, thus
causing a selective shift toward relatively undeveloped newborns and mothers that had
genetically based potential for modifying their maternal behavior. These infants, unable
to cling like infant apes, required their mothers to adopt new foraging strategies that
allowed them to attend vigilantly to their infants by creating and using prosodic and ges-
tural markings to encourage them to behave and follow. These proto-motherese markings
eventually became conventionalized utterances that formed “proto-words” for those born
into these particular hominin groups. Poliva (2015) has recently offered some tentative
neuroanatomical support for the hypothetical development of these infant-mother location
calls into the beginnings of speech.
Critics of Falk’s theory argue, however, that the substrates of proto-speech/language
may not be found in proto-motherese but rather in other primate vocalizations involved
in courting, pair bonding, social grooming, or some other related phenomenon, and that
her theory requires substantially more work on how contemporary motherese and ﬁrst-
language acquisition on the one hand are interrelated with prelinguistic evolution in early
hominins on the other hand (Botha 2008).
Hurford (2007) presents a more abstract and theoretical focus on the interactions
of social trust and evolving communication capabilities in the development of shared
meaning-making among proto-humans. His theoretical perspective focuses on “proto-
humans, who are innately disposed to bond with each other by imitation of meaningful
gestures and vocalizations, and who show a high degree of trust and regard for others.
Furthermore, their life-history includes a long period of dependency and cognitive plas-
ticity. They have inherited from their ancestors a largely innate, but partly learned, set of
calls, of crucial utility for survival and reproduction. The plasticity of the infants allows
the genetic component of these calls to diminish while the learned component can main-
tain the system... In times this leads to an enlarged repertoire of learned conventionalized

3.4
Culture-Centric Theories of Language Evolution
39
meaningful calls, which simultaneously convey practical information and group mem-
bership. The calls are taken seriously (e.g., believed and acted upon) by members of
the group because their conventionalized form reliably signals group membership....This
keeps the group together as a cohesive social unit, which can outcompete less cohesive
groups because of the practical utility of its communal conventional communicative code”
(2007, pp. 329–330).
One problem with Hurford’s theoretical perspective is that it lacks an explanation
of how any set of animal natural signals could become conventionalized to the extent
to which they can form the basis of more arbitrary proto-words. This may have been
addressed by Sievers and Gruber (2020) who posit the existence of a continuum between
arbitrary and non-arbitrary signals communicated by humans and non-humans, arguing
further that there are at least some partially arbitrary elements in non-human primate
communication, especially in the use of speciﬁc objects in various social interactions, as
well as some non-arbitrary elements in human communication, especially in high arousal
situations that can produce, for instance, screams. This also implies that social learning
mechanisms for a nonhuman signal that is partially arbitrary do not have to be at the
same level of complexity as that of human signal learning (Whiten et al. 2022) and that
certain non-arbitrary signals such as screams are still inherent in humans (Arnal et al.
2015). Thus, communication conventions may have emerged over an extremely long time
period, making use of existing natural signals.
Dunbar’s “Gossip and Grooming” hypothesis (1995, 2017) is also culture-oriented,
focusing on the transition from daytime grooming and gossip among very small groups
of hominins to the larger groupings made possible by the ability to start and control
campﬁres, which also facilitated nighttime “vocal grooming” activities such as rhyth-
mic drumming and singing that would have helped to form larger group cohesion. The
argument is that vocal grooming thus evolved gradually into vocal language through the
medium of gossip and other narratives by the group members. However, there is little
evidence to show that “vocal grooming” itself could become cognitively complex enough
to transition into syntactical speech.
Mithen’s (2006) “Hmmmmm” theory is an elaboration of Darwin’s original notion of a
so-called proto-language originating as proto-music. According to Mithen, early hominin
communication was made up of “holistic” phrases, each of which had a unique mean-
ing and which could not be broken down into meaningful constituent parts. Each such
phrase also made extensive use of variation in pitch, rhythm, and melody to communicate
information, express emotion and induce emotion in other individuals. “Hmmmmm” is
said to have had the following characteristics: it was holistic, manipulative, multi-modal,
musical, and mimetic.
Mithen argues that Neanderthal skeletal fossils suggest they had the capacity for vocal
communication, but there are few traces of linguistically mediated behavior in other,
archaeological evidence. His claim is that they had a complex vocal communication
system, but it was a type of Hmmmmm rather than language, inherited from ancestral

40

Proto-Signs, Proto-Words
hominins common to them and to homo sapiens, who employed holistic communication
similar to those of non-human primate calls, which have often been described as musi-
cal. These vocalizations of Pliocene ancestral Neanderthals would have been similar and
eventually also evolved into human language and music during the course of hominin
evolution, most likely as part of the process by which modern Homo sapiens originated
in Africa.
Critics note that Mithen’s Hmmmmm phrases would have been an indivisible unit
that had to be learned, uttered, and understood as a single acoustic sequence, similar
to the critique of Arbib’s homophrastic proto-words (Tallerman 2008). Each utterance
would also have to be stored as a single concept in the hominin’s mental lexicon and
retrieved from storage to be uttered, and today nothing remotely as complex is stored as
a single concept in any known languages. A second criticism is that like all linguistic
or proto-linguistic communication, holistic utterances must be culturally transmitted; in
other words, they are unlike ape calls, which are essentially innate. So, the mechanism
by which Neanderthals learned the highly speciﬁc meanings that Mithen attributes to his
holistic utterances is left unspeciﬁed.
Another criticism is that the study of Neanderthal communication is extremely lim-
ited by the lack of soft tissue evidence and the existing fossil evidence (Johansson 2015;
Lieberman 2015) so it is especially difﬁcult to evaluate his hypotheses regarding these.
Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that, regardless of the possible musicality of their
communication systems, Neanderthals and Denisovans possessed language capabilities,
given that, as stated by Dediu and Levinson (2018, p. 53): “If one considers all of the
cultural skills needed to survive in ecologies from the Arctic to game-poor Mediterranean
littorals, it is difﬁcult to argue that Neanderthals lacked complex linguistic codes, capa-
ble of communicating about spatial locations, hunting and gathering, fauna and ﬂora,
social relations, technologies, and so on,” as well as the fact that traces of Neanderthal or
Denisovan DNA are present in all modern populations (Chen et al. 2020).
The work of Scott-Phillips (Scott-Phillips et al. 2009; Scott-Phillips and Kirby 2010)
centers on his view that primate intelligence is to a signiﬁcant degree explained by the
highly social nature of primate life and explains why humans, who are extremely social
even by primate standards, would have evolved particularly sophisticated forms of social
cognition, which eventually led to ostensive (declarative) communication. His approach
is largely predicated on the results of simulations of such evolution through signaling
games. He suggests that early instances of ostensive communication would have been
halting ones, but a number of cognitive adaptations that make ostensive communication
operate smoothly and efﬁciently would probably have followed. A parallel development
would have been the emergence, through repeated interaction and cultural transmission,
of conventional ways in which to use ostensive communication, conventions that would in
time become ossiﬁed into words, grammars, and the other constituent parts of languages.
The criticisms of language evolution study through simulated signaling games, such as
Scott-Phillips’s work, center around the difference between artiﬁcial agents and natural

ones, whether human or otherwise, and the necessity of incorporating those factors into
the model (Liu 2014). However, there now seems to be a growing amount of empirical
evidence to support the existence of deixic behavior and even ostensive communication
by great apes, which would tend to foreground the role of social cognition within the
evolution of language (Scott-Phillips and Heintz 2023).
In summary then, the earliest referential communication demonstrated by displaced
reference (the use of alarm calls to alert conspeciﬁcs to impending threats) and direct
deixis (the use of gestures to indicate desired objects and actions) appears to be related
to the so-called “E and G” (“embodied” and “grounded”) cognition. Such rudimentary
cognition and communication capabilities form the grounds on which more sophisticated
referential communication may become possible, whether by ape, Homo antecessor, or
artiﬁcial intelligence (Borghi and Pecher 2011) as well as the evolutionary possibilities
leading toward more socially distributed cognition (Gamble et al. 2011).
The continuing development of shared attention, which has been observed repeatedly
in non-human primate communities (Leavens, 2011), is another obvious requisite for more
extended “reference” and “relevance” exchanges, with or without speech or language. The
evolution of human cooperation beyond small kinship groups over time would depend
upon the recognition of identity and reciprocity, which would eventually lead both to the
emergence of practices for naming individuals and accounting for actions, both of which
are prerequisite for truly human culture (Mullins et al. 2013).
Despite the likelihood that we may never be able to identify what Botha (2012) iron-
ically termed “the God particle” of language evolution and the reality that scientists
continue to argue vehemently over the possibilities of a seminal proto-language prior
to all known proto-languages and modern languages, there continues to be important new
work in a variety of disciplines that can illuminate aspects of how words became “key”
to human cognition. The next chapter will deal with the issues of human language: its
varied philologies, philosophies, and pragmatics.

Abstract
This chapter discusses past and present work in philology (the historical study of lan-
guage) and pragmatics (the naturally occurring social usage of language), as well as
some of the more important contributions of philosophers of language and linguists as
they may relate to key words.
As explained in Chap. 3, it is still unknown as to whether a single seminal proto-language
might have developed in one small group millennia ago and diffused more broadly as its
speakers migrated over time, or whether the very ﬁrst proto-languages were independently
or repeatedly invented by several geographically separated small bands of humans, or
whether these processes were much more complex and diverse, involving gestural or
vocal initiatives toward simple symbolic communication that eventually resulted in a more
general “proto-language” that could be understood by contacts among these proto-speech
communities. It is, however, a reasonable assumption that the beginning of these processes
took place roughly 100,000 years before the resulting development of the ﬁrst identiﬁed
proto-languages studied by today’s historical linguists (Arbib 2012).
4.1
Philology and Plato
As Goody and Watt (1963) pointed out, in illiterate societies a word necessarily takes
its meaning in the context of its usage, as there is no way to accumulate meaning over
time except in the individual memories of a speaker and listener. This presumably would
apply to an even greater extent to the gradual development over time of a consistent set
of proto-words that could eventually comprise such proto-languages.

Proto-Indo-European, the ancestral form of the Indo-European language family, is the
most studied of the known proto-languages and can be traced back to 3500 BC through
the evidence of incised clay seals unearthed in Mesopotamia. Proto-Sino-Tibetan, the
ancestral form of the largest and most complex group of languages, including Chinese,
has not yet been ﬁrmly dated, but the large numbers of pottery vessels with incised signs
found at the Dawenkou site near the Yellow River in China may indicate that 3500 BC
is a reasonable estimate there as well. Proto-Afro-Asiatic, identiﬁed through what are
believed to be makers marks on pots unearthed at Abydos in Egypt, can be traced back
to 3400 BC (Mitchell 1999) but is likely to be earlier as well.
However, Dematté (2010) rightly observes that print-acculturated scholars may tend to
conﬂate the development of language with the development of those writing systems that
provide the archaeological evidence for the existence of various languages, but the writing
systems themselves were invented for other purposes, such as accounting, astronomy,
divination, meteorology, and taxation, and only gradually began to serve more general
linguistic purposes. Surviving samples of early writing systems, therefore, cannot provide
conclusive evidence for dating the origins of spoken languages that they may document,
and many spoken languages have developed and ﬂourished without associated writing
systems. In the case of proto-Indo-European, for instance, historical linguistic research has
found that the ﬁve major Indo-European language subfamilies (Celtic, Germanic, Italic,
Balto-Slavic, and Indo-Iranian) were diverging from the Indo-European proto-language as
early as 6000 BC (Bouckaert et al. 2012), indicating an even earlier origin for the parent
proto-language.
Interest in protolinguistics and the historical etymology of words also dates back sev-
eral millennia, though the techniques employed in their study were far more similar to
folklore and discursive practices intended to facilitate the formation of in-group iden-
tity through the creation of myths and genealogies rather than to any modern linguistic
methods (Sluiter et al. 2015).
The most celebrated example of this early interest is found in the Cratylus, a Pla-
tonic dialogue from the fourth century BC in which Greek philosopher Socrates is shown
debating the purpose of words in both practical and philosophical terms that still resonate
today, and which provides a marked contrast to the much more limited linguistic views of
his sophist and stoic philosophical contemporaries. The wide-ranging nature of the dia-
logue even makes it possible to ﬁnd in it precursors to philosophical views ranging from
that of Quine (1960) on the interdeterminacy of reference to that of Goodman on the irre-
alism of reference (1975) to that of Davidson (1979) on the inscrutability of reference.
Plato’s Socrates brings all this to a brilliantly inconclusive and remarkably contemporary
conclusion (“And when you have found the truth, come and tell me”) as, despite all our
frustration with words as tools, it is indisputable that we have almost no others with which
to work.
Accordingly, commentators have continued to be fascinated by this dialogue, in which
Plato cleverly weaves references to his own literary and philosophical training, attempts

to analyze differences between word etymologies that seem to have philosophical foun-
dations and those that do not, examines the scientiﬁc and social constructions of reality
made possible by language, and explores the impossibilities of determining meaning with
or without words. However, modern scholars have puzzled over the lack of intellectual
sophistication shown by the etymological section of this dialogue as compared to the
other sections, not realizing that it accurately represents both earlier and current thinking
about word origins and meanings in Plato’s time, which was very unlike how we think
about these today (Ademollo 2011).
Later classical thinkers, the ﬁrst philologists, attempted to create order from a grow-
ing number of texts in different dialects as their culture was emerging from orality into
literacy. Their problem was how to choose among word forms: which could be consid-
ered true, or correct, or usual, or preferred. They decided upon four principles: natura
(nature), consuetudo (custom or usage), analogia (analogy), and auctoritas (authority).
These principles conveyed the notions that the nature of any word is shown by its mean-
ing, something that is expressed in normal usage, while analogy in language shows the
patterns that apply to numerous words of similar types, and authority determines whose
word usage is considered more important than that of others (Zetzel 2019). These original
principles were, however, applied and ranked in different ways over time and in differ-
ing contexts and circumstances through antiquity, into the medieval period, and even into
modern times.
4.2
Historical Linguistics
More modern efforts at historical linguistics also demonstrate the particular preoccupa-
tions and proclivities of the researcher’s own era. Daston and Most (2015, p. 384) note
that “well into the nineteenth century in Europe—indeed, especially in the nineteenth cen-
tury—philology not only counted as a science; it was the science, the model of the highest
form of knowledge. The discoveries of the philologists, whether concerning the author-
ship of the Iliad, the decipherment of hieroglyphics, or the ancestry of modern languages,
counted alongside those of the chemists and the physicists as among the most spectac-
ular of the age and their methods as among the most rigorous. Big Science (including
the phrase) began not with the science-based industries of coal tar derivatives or optical
glass but with the grand projects of the philologists, such as Theodor Mommsen’s Corpus
Inscriptionum Latinarum.”
Building on the ideas of his contemporary Charles de Brosses, French encyclopedist
Denis Diderot argued in 1760 that an original “universal core vocabulary” developed due
to the commonalities of human physiology that facilitated the creation of certain sounds
that became the initial syllables, and only much later became differentiated into early
languages (Clark-Evans 1993). In Germany, romanticist Johann Gottfried Herder’s 1770
Treatise on the Origin of Language laid the foundations for both the ﬁeld of comparative

linguistics and linguistic nationalism, arguing that every people’s language and culture
became so naturally interwoven as to constitute a unique folk identity (Wolff 2016).
In Britain, there was an intense intellectual interest in antiquity and its antecedents,
often from a religious perspective (Hiebert 2007). Sharon Turner published several papers
in the ﬁrst issue of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature comparing speciﬁc
words from a wide variety of global languages, ranging from Hebrew to Huron, and
concluded that humanity’s original (or “antediluvian”) words included terms for “mother,”
“father,” and “water,” but that the many obvious variations in their subsequent linguistic
forms could be attributed to postdiluvian separation into different populations after the
destruction of the Tower of Babel (Turner 1827). His etymological investigation was, of
course, only one of many addressing these popular questions during this period of intense
intellectual interest in language and its antique precedents by ﬁgures such as Condillac in
France, Grimm in Germany, and Locke in England (Eddy 2011).
Investigations into the origin of language became more controversial in the aftermath
of the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859, with the dawning of the realization
that those evolutionary processes described in Darwin’s work might extend beyond the
book’s contents to include its readers as well. Not coincidentally, the Société de Linguis-
tique de Paris in France banned any discussion of the topic of the origins of language in
1864 (Andresen 2013). At the 1870 meeting of the American Philological Association in
Rochester, New York, a similar ban was discussed, and linguistic luminary W. D. Whit-
ney of Yale, editor of the Century Dictionary, despite defending the topic as a legitimate
one for science, would nevertheless continue to conﬁne his attention to more tractable
word derivation investigations than a truly scientiﬁc search for a “ﬁrst word” would entail
(2013, p. 1).
Darwin himself propounded in The Descent of Man (1871, pp. 59–61) that “The for-
mation of different languages and of distinct species, and the proofs that both have been
developed through a gradual process, are curiously the same. But we can trace the ori-
gin of many words further back than in the case of species, for we can perceive that
they have arisen from the imitation of various sounds, as in alliterative poetry. …The
survival or preservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for existence is natural
selection.” Even the London Philological Society banned all such discussions in 1873,
despite or perhaps because of the fact that their massive New English Dictionary on
Historical Principles project to collect and deﬁne all English words was underway and
would eventually become the Oxford English Dictionary. German linguist August Schle-
icher was one of the few who continued his empirical efforts in philology (Taub 1993).
However, while proposing that contemporary languages had inherited traits which could
be traced back to their original proto-languages, he proposed that these were subject to a
sort of Hegelian dialectic: after a period of development and growth, language repeatedly
encounters various conceptual challenges that are antithetical to the original linguistic
“thesis,” and results in newly “synthesized” languages over time. Although this idea was

4.2
Historical Linguistics
51
never widely adopted, Schleicher’s efforts to trace existing languages to their proto-Indo-
European roots did lead to a more systematized genealogical approach than those used
by earlier philologists.
Besides wide recognition as a founder of structural linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure
is also celebrated for his sharp differentiation between the diachronic approach (which
compares language at two different points in time and is used for comparative and histor-
ical linguistics) and the synchronic approach (which focuses on language at one particular
point in time and is used for modern linguistics) and which he expressed as “the opposi-
tion between the two viewpoints—synchronic and diachronic—is absolute and allows no
compromise,” (de Saussure 2011, p. 83). Until very recently, his dictum discouraged most
linguists from exploring other forms of symbolic communication not expressed in modern
language. Interestingly, however, de Saussure’s own thinking may not be fully reﬂected
in his posthumously edited and published Course in General Linguistics, as his extensive
surviving manuscript materials show that he was also well aware that the theoretical lan-
guage system he modeled was only one among many important sign systems (Stawarska
2015). Indeed, some of his own historical work on the Hittite language, reconstructing
laryngeal consonants missing in certain words, disparaged at the time by other linguists
due to the fact that these phonemes were unknown in other surviving Indo-European
languages, was only vindicated some 50 years later with the discovery of Hittite texts
preserved on cuneiform tablets in Anatolia (Sturtevant 1952).
Although historical and comparative linguistics have had numerous successes since
de Saussure’s time in building empirically based genealogies of languages (Jager and
Wichmann 2016), approximately 10,000 years seems to represent the maximum extent of
that time horizon. Newer efforts focus on correlational studies (Ladd et al. 2015) and on
computational linguistics, both of which rely largely on statistical methods and processing
immense volumes of data, and attempt more ambitious investigations into the past.
For example, Pagel (2017) and his collaborators (Pagel et al. 2013) have taken an
evolutionary, statistical linguistic approach to the search for what might be considered
original “key words.” Their analysis of the World Etymology Project corpus has proposed
that a very small group of reconstructed proto-words and their cognates in each of the
Altaic, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, Dravidian, Eskimo, Indo-European, Kartvelian, and Uralic
language families, unlike the vast majority of words that have emerged or evolved over
time, could be traced back 15,000 years to an unknown ancestral Eurasian language.
Their list of 23 “ultraconserved words” (Thou, I, Not, That, We, To give, Who, This,
What, Man/male, Ye, Old, Mother, To hear, Hand, Fire, To pull, Black, To ﬂow, Bark,
Ashes, To spit, Worm) has attracted criticism on the grounds that such shorter words
tend to appear related more frequently by chance alone (Mahowald and Gibson 2013).
There has not been general acceptance of this ﬁnding by mainstream linguists, who also
tend to look askance at other statistically oriented models not supported by empirical
linguistic data. These critics, such as Perslsvaig and Lewis (2015), argue that the so-called
reinvention of historical linguistics through the use of phylogenetic and phylogeographical

52

analysis, treating cognates like genes and conceptualizing the spread of languages in terms
of the diffusion of viruses, produces incoherent results, contradicted by the empirical
record, since clearly languages do not evolve like biological species and do not spread
like viruses.
4.3
Reference and Relevance
There are two primary problems for spoken language: the philosophical problem of refer-
ence, which is the question of how words relate to objects in the world, while the practical
problem of relevance is the question of how speakers and listeners come to understand
what one another may mean.
As noted above, the problem of reference was identiﬁed by Plato in the Cratylus and
has continued to fascinate many other philosophers, from Russell (1910) to Wittgenstein
(1958) to Searle (1969) to Putnam (1975): how is it possible for our shared verbal expres-
sions to refer to objects in the world as well as to objects that do not exist? Moreover,
how is it possible that these speech acts have become so taken for granted that even
very small children are expected to learn to perform them with spontaneity and rapidity?
Bruner aptly referred to this process as the “routes to reference” (1998). Reference (or,
in the case of non-verbal adults or pre-verbal infants, declarative pointing) is such a fun-
damental intellectual skill for human beings that inability to perform it is considered a
serious learning disability.
In addition to de Saussure in Switzerland, those philosophers of the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries who possessed a marked scientiﬁc interest in logic and linguis-
tics, notably Mill and Peirce in the United States, Ogden, Quine, Richards, and Russell
in Great Britain, and Wittgenstein in Germany, all tended to focus on developing more
abstract systems, and individual words themselves were valued primarily as compositional
elements within the contexts of these theoretical models.
Ferdinand De Sassure’s legacy to linguistics, which he termed semiology, is best known
for its formal approach to the linguistic sign, which is comprised of the signiﬁer (the
signiﬁer (signiﬁant), and the signiﬁed (signiﬁé). Unlike Peircean semiotics discussed in
Chap. 2, which can also be applied to a non-linguistic environment, de Sassurean semiol-
ogy’s arbitrary relation between words and their meanings is almost totally constrained by
language conventions within a particular speech community. According to de Saussure,
language is a meaningful system of social discourse that expresses concepts through a
dyadic relation to particular chosen sound patterns at any given time, and though there is
often a referent beyond the dyad, the linguist need not take that into account, nor are the
individual utterances of a speaker (parole) of more importance than their overall contribu-
tion to the system of discourse (langue). Semiology, therefore, is well suited to the study
of a closed system of signs, and de Saussure’s seminal Course in General Linguistics has
had an enduring impact on linguistic research in general (Seuren 2016).

4.3
Reference and Relevance
53
Early theorists focused on the so-called “formal language” in which logic is studied,
while later theorists became more interested in the “natural language” in which human
beings converse. For instance, in his seminal philosophical article, “On Denoting” (1905),
Russell concluded that some words within a sentence, while contributing to its meaning,
may not have meaning in isolation, similar to symbols that are meaningful only in speciﬁc
contexts in logic.
In his Theory of Language, the German linguist Bühler (1934; 2011) developed his
“Organon” model, positing a communicative triangle (a state of affairs or objects that
are symbolically represented through language by the expressions of some speaker and
the resulting signiﬁcance to some listener) model, which may be considered as both a
successor to Peirce’s semiotic model and a precursor to Shannon–Weaver’s decoding
model.
The Soviet linguist Vološinov challenged both Peirce and de Saussure as he focused
attention on words as ideological signs: that is, the relationship of language and ideologies
as these are constructed through dialogic communication. His Marxism and the Philosophy
of Language (1973), although published in Russian in the 1930s was not translated into
English until 40 years after his death.
Much better known in the Western world, Wittgenstein worked within the tradition of
formal language and logic in his early works, but his interests later shifted to natural lan-
guage, with its “language games” in which the problems of determining meaning become
central in his Philosophical Investigations (1958).
As the ﬁeld of contemporary linguistics began to separate from that of the philosophy
of language after the Second World War, linguists such as Firth (1957, p. 11) began
to take a more analytic approach, with his aphorism “you shall know a word by the
company it keeps,” indicating that the immediate situational context of the word is critical
to determining meaning. This analytic approach, both quantitative and contextual, was
foundational to the emerging ﬁeld of corpus linguistics, in which large collections of texts
in speciﬁc languages are mined to discover how speciﬁc words were used in context. Other
important work in contemporary linguistics include that of Empson on word ambiguity
(1947), that of Sinclair on word collocation (1991), and that of Stubbs on lexical semantics
(2001).
The practical problem of relevance (how speakers and listeners come to understand
each other’s meanings) has been addressed by Grice (1975), who proposed that the anal-
ysis of the meaning of signs (that is, words) should incorporate methods to deal with
statements regarding what a particular speaker or writer meant by a particular sign on a
particular occasion, which might well vary from the standard meaning of that sign. He
also identiﬁed certain cooperative principles that are often unconsciously employed by
speakers during conversational exchanges. These include optimal principles for the quan-
tity of information, quality of information, relevance of information, and presentation of
information.

54

Philologies, Philosophies, Pragmatics
These Gricean “maxims” regarding listener expectations regarding speaker content and
communication were further developed by Sperber and Wilson (1986, 2012) in their work
on relevance theory, which focused attention on the effects of context on comprehension.
This becomes especially critical in conversational exchanges, as mental lexicons are nec-
essarily unique to each individual, and words may accordingly be associated with differing
concepts as well. Word meanings, therefore, are “underspeciﬁed” until additional context
is provided. Words also differ in terms of the amount of encoded conceptual or proce-
dural content they may carry within sentences: “dog” and “red” are perceived as content
words while “but” and “also” are perceived as discourse connectives (Blakemore 1987).
However, Carston (2016) has suggested that that most “content” words encode not only
a concept but also a procedure for ad hoc concept construction. Relevance theorists have
argued for some time that the interpretation of every “content” word is ﬁne-tuned in con-
text so it is possible that the processing of a “content” word might automatically activate
such a ﬁne-tuning procedure.
Research into conversation analysis has shown that word meanings are also very often
negotiated and renegotiated during the course of an exchange, as the participants attempt
to understand one another. This is a complicated interaction, even when the conversational
partners are members of the same speech community, particularly as there are more con-
cepts than words to express them, and words often contain multiple concepts that may
need additional words to express the speaker’s intent (Sperber and Wilson 2012). A related
phenomenon is that of lexical entrainment, identiﬁed by Brennan and Clark (1996) as the
process of developing “conceptual pacts” during an exchange during which one partici-
pant adopts the same wording as the other participant in order to facilitate the attainment
of conceptual clarity.
This problem of meaning is exacerbated when the communicative “partnership”
becomes more taxing: for example, when translation is necessary (He et al. 2016) or when
the exchange of communicative acts is separated by space or time, as in a long-distance
phone call over a faulty connection (Schoenenberg et al. 2014). However, research on the
well-known “cocktail party” phenomenon of divided attention among multiple ongoing
conversations ﬁrst identiﬁed by Cherry (1953) and later investigated by Wood and Cowan
(1995) has shown that words perceived as “key” (such as hearing one’s name spoken in
an adjacent conversation) tend to shift one’s attention to that away from the immediate
conversation.
Understanding the problem of relevance also requires the empirical investigation of
naturally occurring social interaction (Moore 2013), which is the focus of the ﬁeld of
language pragmatics. Quine (1987, p. 5) famously said, “Each of us learns his language
by observing other people’s verbal behavior and having his own faltering verbal behavior
observed and reinforced or corrected by others. We depend strictly on overt behavior in
observable situations. As long as our command of our language ﬁts all external check-
points, where our utterance or our reaction to someone’s utterance can be appraised in

4.4

55
the light of some shared situation, so long all is well. Our mental life between check-
points is indifferent to our rating as a master of the language. There is nothing in
linguistic meaning, then, beyond what is to be gleaned from overt behavior in observable
circumstances.”
4.4
The Problems of Pragmatics
Nevertheless, despite Quine, there must be some unobservables at work in the acquisition
of words. The cognitive theory of language acquisition was proposed by Jean Piaget in
1926 (2001). He believed that language is another manifestation of the symbolic functions
that children between the ages of two and three begin to develop as part of their general
cognitive development. Thus, he proposed that children’s use of language reﬂects how
they think about the world, and their vocabulary expands accordingly as they acquire new
concepts.
Chomsky (1965) claimed that there is a “Language Acquisition Device” that children
possess at birth, providing them with a set of universal principles of language that are trig-
gered by minimal language experience. Slobin and Bowerman (2007) later modiﬁed this
position, arguing that rather than possessing substantive rules of language at birth, children
are born with a set of procedures and inferences that allow them to learn any language in
the world. However, there is increasing evidence that what allows rapid language learning
in children is a set of generalized learning competencies that can be applied to a variety
of domains (D˛abrowska 2015). The interactionist or social theories of language suggest
that language exists for the purpose of communication and can therefore be learned only
in the context of interpersonal interaction (Lytle and Kuhl 2017). According to this theo-
retical viewpoint, the language behaviors of adults, especially the infant-directed speech
often termed “motherese,” are critical to this process.
Wierzbicka’s (2021) work on the so-called “semantic primitives” lends some support
to several of these theories, as her comparison of multiple languages has found that they
contain common conceptual frameworks (such as up/down) but that these frameworks ﬁnd
expression in highly diverse grammars and vocabularies that are speciﬁc to each language
or language family, indicating that while certain modes of perception may be innately
human, shared modes of expression are culturally speciﬁc.
Xu and Tenenbaum (2007) have proposed a Bayesian model of word learning that
claims both children and adults quickly infer the meaning of a word based not on a
process of deductive hypothesis elimination or by associative learning, but rather by inte-
grating prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of
the observed examples.
Regardless of the speciﬁc underlying explanation, the initial stage of this process is
prenatal. The near-term fetus has a mature auditory system that can detect and respond to

56

sound (Voegtline et al. 2013). Fetuses actively attend to their mothers’ voices during preg-
nancy, which provides a continuous source of information about the mother’s language.
A newborn can recognize the voice of its mother and prefers this to unfamiliar voices and
languages. Prenatal exposure to language can also enable the newborn to recognize the
basic structures of that language (Hepper 2015).
Communicating with a newborn usually involves special infant-directed speech
(“motherese”) that employs a singsong vocal style in a higher than usual register, exag-
gerated phrasing, short, simple words, and modiﬁed word order, coupled with intimate,
intensive interactions with the child (Parish-Morris et al. 2013). This development of
shared attention, involving gaze direction, demonstrative and deictic gesturing, and con-
tinuing vocal exchanges between caregiver and infant, helps to orient the child toward
recognition of the relationships among different objects in the world and the public words
for these objects. Even during the prelinguistic states of vocal production, termed “bab-
bling,” this feedback is critical in helping the infant acquire preliminary skills necessary
for eventual word production (Goldstein and Schwade 2008; Gros-Louis et al. 2008). One
of the very earliest words that infants reliably recognize is the sound patterns of their own
names (Mandel et al. 1995).
A cross-cultural study has shown that the ﬁrst ﬁve words in an infant’s vocabulary tend
to be these other “key” terms: Mommy, Daddy, hi, bye, and uhoh (Tardif et al. 2008).
Further cross-cultural research (Waxman et al. 2013) suggests that infants ﬁnd it easier
to identify and name objects (nouns) than actions (verbs) regardless of whether the spe-
ciﬁc language environment is noun-friendly (English, French) or verb-friendly (Japanese,
Korean).
As Saint-Georges et al. (2013) note, clearly “motherese” is helpful in the development
of the child’s cognition and communication skills, given that 18-month-olds are slower to
interpret target words (i.e., familiar object names) in isolation, and putting target words in
sentence-ﬁnal positions may help them segment the linguistic stream. Children themselves
help in this early process by both pointing to and naming objects to clarify and modify
their meaning (Cartmill et al. 2014).
By age 5, children can recognize 10,000 words in spoken language, though they may
not be able to produce all of these correctly themselves (Law et al. 2016). This process is
particularly important because words learned earlier in life have been shown to be easier
to access than those learned later (Elsherif et al. 2023).This so-called “age-of-acquisition
effect” will also have life-long impact in terms of word production, recognition, and
retention (Brysbaert and Ellis 2015; Cuetos et al. 2017).
By adulthood, the average lexicon size is estimated to be approximately 50,000 words
(Aitchison 2012). Almost all of these words are acquired through hearing or seeing their
use in context, either informally through conversation or more formally through education
(Sternberg 1987). An associated process is the development of the individual’s mental
grammar, which contains the linguistic rules by which the lexemes are to be combined to
make understandable sentences.

4.5
Expanding the World of Words
57
Each individual’s mental lexicon is also made up of two integrated, interacting com-
ponents: an internal “dictionary” of lexemes and their formal meanings, and the internal
“encyclopedia” of the connections between formal meanings and the expressive, expan-
sive network of concepts that associate these with reality (Begby 2016). The importance of
this dual processing is that the “dictionary” allows fast retrieval of speciﬁc words and their
denotations, while the “encyclopedia” allows more gradual comprehension of any addi-
tional connotations and implications. Finding the “right words” for any given situation,
therefore, is a complex though opaque mental operation, though in routine interactions it
is performed with great efﬁciency. Early communicative practices also continue to inﬂu-
ence adult use of words. Moore (2013) found that when people do not know the correct
word for an object, they tend to utilize the same “referential practices” as do young chil-
dren: they try other possible names, they point if the object is present, or they attempt to
create some kind of iconic gesture or depiction if the object is not present.
4.5
Expanding the World of Words
The “right words” are also key to much of LIS research. Taylor’s seminal question-
negotiation model (1968) is predicated on a “visceral need” which can only be satisﬁed
by ﬁnding the right words in which to couch the request for information. The Belkin
et al. anomalous state of knowledge (ASK) model (1982) requires “linguistic, pragmatic
transformations” into a statement expressing a request for information, while the “ex-
ploration” stage of Kuhltau’s Information Search Process (ISP) model (1993) similarly
demands identiﬁcation of the right words in order to move on to the more satisfying
stages of query formulation and information collection.
All of this seminal work is founded on what is generally known as the conduit
metaphor (Reddy 1979), which is a ﬁgurative expression often used in describing com-
munication as a process in which speakers or writers insert their ideas, feelings, concepts,
etc. into containers such as words, sentences, poems, books, etc. whose contents are then
extracted by listeners or readers. Day (2000) observes that, while loosely related to the
information processing paradigm of cognitive science, the conduit metaphor is not the-
oretically or empirically grounded in contemporary cognitive research and it has been
utilized in LIS and many other ﬁelds without a continuing examination of its origins and
outcomes. It can, however, be truthfully said that the conduit metaphor itself would not
be able to function without the use of words.
On an even broader level, “key” words can serve to express attention-focusing con-
cepts within different cultures. Much work in anthropology over the past century has
been devoted to investigating whether and to what extent language may constrain thought.
According to Lucy (1997), empirical approaches to this issue of the so-called “linguis-
tic relativity” are classiﬁed into three types: structure-centered approaches that begin
with language differences and ask about their implications for thought; domain-centered

58
4
Philologies, Philosophies, Pragmatics
approaches that begin with experienced reality and ask how different languages encode
it; and behavior-centered approaches that begin with some practical concern and seek an
explanation in language.
Among the seminal structure-centered approaches are those of anthropologist Franz
Boas, credited with the seminal insight, based on his work with Native American lan-
guages, that, contrary to general belief among linguists at the time, there is no “ideal”
language toward which all languages are in various stages of evolving, and that under-
estimation of non-Western languages was due to the imposition by Western linguists and
anthropologists of their own categories and concepts on these rather than an empirical
investigation of the languages themselves; Edward Sapir, who emphasized the importance
of the categories that comprise the formal structure underlying any linguistic system, and
argued that these varying formal structures inﬂuence the meaning value of their linguis-
tic elements, leading the language speakers to interpret events within the systematically
coherent construal of reality imposed by their language; and that of Benjamin Whorf,
who recognized that large-scale structural meanings interrelate semantically, requiring the
study of the speciﬁc grammar as a whole (Lucy 2016, pp. 488–489).
Ironically, the linguistic contribution for which Boas, Sapir, and Whorf are best known,
the so-called “Whorf-Sapir hypothesis” that language constrains the thoughts available to
speakers of any particular language, exempliﬁed by the supposed multiple Inuit terms for
“snow,” was not in fact developed by any of the three; language behaviorists Lennehen and
Brown synthesized some of the elements in their predecessors’ writings in order to come
up with a version they believe could be tested empirically (Pavlenko 2016). The “Whorf-
Sapir hypothesis” has since been criticized for its implicit emphasis on monolingualism as
a cultural norm, which is neither historically nor ethnographically sound, for its explicit
emphasis on general laboratory tests of concepts such as color rather than ﬁeldwork with
speciﬁc languages, and for the various misconceptions its popularization has created about
particular languages (Martin 1986).
There has also been substantial work on prejudice in language, which has been found
to be nearly universal as native speakers either consciously or unconsciously denigrate
those perceived to be outsiders with xenophobic terms (Green 1996).
An important international extension of the work of cultural theorist Raymond
Williams (1976) on “keywords” in English (which was itself an expansion of his seminal
1958 book on the cultural importance of speciﬁc key words) and which continues to enjoy
new revisions as well as new applications (Hart et al. 2005), and to inspire new approaches
to analyzing English, technological (Scott 1997) as well as theoretical (Highmore 2022),
is that of Polish linguist Anna Wierzbicka (1997, 2014) who warns against the hazards
of theorizing from a single dominant language such as English in her documentation of
the variety of “key words” as perceived by a variety of linguistic communities, including
Japanese and Russian, emphasizing the dangers of monolingualism, while stressing the
cross-cultural understanding of core values that can be achieved by better understanding
the “key concepts” embedded in such “key words.”

Risager (2020) dissects the concept of what has been called both linguaculture and
languaculture, which is comprised of three complex and highly inter-related cultural/
linguistic dimensions: the semantic-pragmatic dimension, the poetic dimension, and the
identity dimension. This area of study analyzes the mutual inﬂuence of culture on lan-
guage and language on culture, identifying four critical elements (linguistic ﬂows, which
are codes such as English or Swahili; linguacultura ﬂows (meanings related to ﬁrst lan-
guage use of particular languages); discursive ﬂows (meanings not necessarily related to
particular languages); and other cultural ﬂows (non-language meanings, including semi-
otic meanings in art and music). As global migration affects the language composition
in various geographic settings, an understanding of how people learn to interact within
different linguacultures becomes increasingly important.
Recent investigations have shown that multilingualism can destabilize entrenched
habits of thought through the availability of new concepts through language learning
(Evans 2010). Although it is now clear through recent research in brain scanning that
cognition is individually embodied, so-called social cognition is necessarily reliant on
communication with others through concepts shared with words, so the brain is not nearly
as constrained by language as it is freed by it.
Clearly “key words” have a much richer sociocultural history than commonly rec-
ognized, and their ongoing inﬂuence is still not well understood. The next chapter will
review some of the earliest history of keywords as preserved in rituals and religions, some
of the methods for their communication, and some of their ongoing impacts.

Rites, Religions
Abstract
This chapter describes the possible origins of rites and ritual communication through
the study of embedded mnemonics in carvings, landscape modiﬁcation, and mon-
uments as well as through the creation and memorization of “key symbols” such
as the names of gods and magical invocations that were to become foundational
to early religions as they began to add written narratives to their oral traditions.
It also describes three primary categories of religious keywords that are still perti-
nent today: the imperative (commands), the performative (rituals), and the interpretive
(explanations).
While symbolic communication is generally accepted as the beginning of truly human
culture, early hominin fossils and associated artifacts are usually scattered and fragmen-
tary, and any material objects found with these tend to be difﬁcult to interpret, especially
when the site has been compromised by natural processes or other disturbances over
time. Even identifying the remains of possible communicative or cognitive activities is a
challenge, since the discipline of paleoanthropology has traditionally followed the larger
discipline of archaeology in using a “ladder of inference” (Hawkes 1954) in which sym-
bolic interpretation of the material evidence is usually considered irrelevant or impossible
(Robb 1998). Malafouris (2013, pp. 89–118) notes that a second problem is that of con-
ﬂating symbolic representation with language semiology from the Saussurian perspective
rather than with material semiotics in the Peircean perspective, which he believes is much
more appropriate to the study of such material signs. A third problem currently receiving
some attention is that cognitive archaeology is not immune to the same biases prevalent
among Western-centric research in the other human sciences, in that there is seldom much
consideration of sample diversity and that species-wide inferences and generalizations are

being made without noting potential differences between modern populations, populations
of ancient humans, their hominin ancestors, or cousin lineages (Killin and Pain 2022).
5.1
Origins of Symbols
Nevertheless, the very early indications of possibly symbolic communication are now
being considered of more interest (Kissel and Fuentes 2016, 2017). For instance, the
enigmatic stalagmite structures within Bruniquel Cave in southwest France from roughly
176,000 years ago are now tentatively being attributed to Neanderthal builders and may
represent one of the earliest sites of ritual signiﬁcance (Jaubert et al. 2016).
The earliest widely accepted evidence for reference to symbolic concepts includes the
ﬁgurative rock art at Sulawesi in Indonesia and the cave paintings at Cueva de El Castillo
in Spain, both dating to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago, and the set of 32 geometric
symbols found in caves throughout Europe from the same period (Von Petzinger 2016).
These markings, while known since the discovery of the caves, were often dismissed as
inexplicable or incidental, especially when compared to the representational art found
within. Some markings, such as the meandering lines that von Petzinger spotted at a
site in Portugal’s Côa Valley region, may have been maplike representations of a river or
other landscape features. Other signs, such as the lines inscribed on a deer-tooth necklace,
could have served as memory aids for ceremonialists presiding over important rituals or
recounting a tribe’s origin stories, which would indicate an oral tradition. Such markings,
says von Petzinger, seem to be a way of storing information externally—a form of graphic
communication that may have eventually led to writing.
These substantially predate the stone megaliths that indicate the remains of a ritual-
ized culture at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey as early as the ninth millennium BC, the incised
clay tokens from Mureybet in Syria that recorded speciﬁc contributions of cereal grains
to feasts and other ritual ceremonies from the eighth millennium BC (Schmandt-Besserat
1982) or the incised tortoise shells possibly used for shamanic purposes found at Jihau
in China (Li et al. 2003). Bradley (2012) has studied the prevalence of certain architec-
tural archetypes, notably circular barrows and stone henges, across prehistoric Europe,
which he believes indicates a common orientation toward space and time and an increase
in shared symbolic behavior. More broadly, Kelly (2015) proposes that certain prehis-
toric societies invented sophisticated “oral technologies,” devoting signiﬁcant physical
and mental efforts to extend beyond their original oral traditions by embedding their cul-
tural knowledge through carvings, landscape, and monumental mnemonics that served
as knowledge and memory “spaces” for rituals and other important activities, and thus
could transmit this essential societal information more accurately through generations
than could oral accounts alone. She argues (p. 9) that this “Method of Loci” was origi-
nally based on physical sites used by far earlier cultures than even those of pre-literate
Greece and greatly antedates their celebrated “memory palace” technique utilized well

into the European Renaissance. However, such “oral technologies” themselves may even-
tually lose their last interpreters, and archaeologists must extrapolate the uses of labyrinths
and megaliths, for example, from whatever similarities these may bear to evidence from
other sources.
Language obviously has played an essential role in what Edwards and Middleton
(1987) term the “transcendence of the serial chain of behavior” over time as the social
basis of “symbolic remembering,” which is the use of language to construct joint under-
standings that are accessible and communicable via a common code (i.e., conventional
symbols, grammatical rules, and rules of interpretation). The “shared reference” to culture
and custom becomes immeasurably more complex than was possible through gesture or
other forms of communication prior to the development of a spoken language (Finnegan
2015).
In accordance with Cosmides and Tooby’s (2013) work on evolutionary psychology,
which considers the human mind as a computer populated by a large number of adap-
tive specializations, each equipped with content-rich representations, concepts, inference
systems, and regulatory variables that are functionally organized to solve the complex
problems of survival and reproduction encountered by the ancestral hunter-gatherers, and
for which one of the greatest challenges is the problem of coordinated and cooperative
group action, Watson-Jones and Legare (2016) argue that the capacity to engage in rit-
ual is a psychologically prepared, culturally inherited behavior geared toward facilitating
social group dynamics, group cohesion, and group survival. The invention of new forms
of physical and verbal deixis also allowed “pointing” to presumed natural or supernatu-
ral forces, providing potential explanations for otherwise inexplicable phenomena such as
lightning, drought, or disease and offering possible ways to deal with these.
The development of “key symbols” is integral to religious and ritual practices of all
kinds, as noted by Geertz (1957), Turner (1970), and Ortner (1973). Henderson (1999)
found that divination rites can be considered as the earliest form of exegesis of such super-
natural sources. However, most contemporary research on rituals has tended to focus on
their discursive aspect as preserved within religious traditions and texts, while neglecting
these embodied and iconic aspects, which likely emerged ﬁrst (Kitts 2017). Interestingly,
though, Watts (2005) found that written texts tend to be used as sacred objects in rituals
rather than completely replacing them. For instance, after the destruction of the Temple
in Jerusalem, Hebrew rituals began to become increasingly textualized (Schmid 2012).
5.2
Oral Traditions
The development of such integral social innovations as religion is incumbent on the ability
of a group to cohere through particular ritual behaviors (Rossano 2012) and to remem-
ber certain symbolic concepts expressed by “key words” that help to deﬁne their social
existence (Kirkpatrick and Rossano 2021). The names of gods and goddesses served this

purpose in many cultures. Moreover, an oral culture tends to favor the development of
rhetorical, memorization, and improvisational skills to a greater extent than does a print
culture, so key words play an essential role in deﬁning that society, as shown by the
early emergence of both orators and actors in classical Greece, for example (Yates 1966).
Although, as Havelock (1982, p. 8) pointed out, while there was no speciﬁc term for the
abstract concept of “word” in antiquity, and the discrete sound of individual words are
normally elided in vocal communication, it can be taken for granted that the use of names
and naming demonstrates deliberate verbal deixis in oral societies as well. The names of
gods, kings, and heroes served as social glue for these communities.
In the Mesopotamian epics of Sumer, the lengthy recitation of kings lists, whether or
not these were historically accurate, served to provide “heroic” legitimacy for the ruler
and his heirs (Noegel 2005). The belief in the power of speciﬁc words in ritual charms was
well established in Hittite fertility practices by 1650 BC (Collins 2002) and in Egyptian
medicine by the time of the Papyrus Ebers in 1550 BC (Graf 2002) and undoubtedly has
much earlier roots. Drout (2011, p. 456) ﬁnds that “traditional referentiality is generated
by the combination of repetition with associative memory,” making certain key words and
phrases more likely to be transmitted down generations within speciﬁc formulaic genres.
Archaic Greek culture had no universally recognized sacred texts but relied heavily on
a complex oral tradition of polytheism as well as sacriﬁcial rites and other rituals passed
on by ancestral custom (Henrich 2003). Havelock (1963) emphasized the importance of
the oral transmission of traditional knowledge through didactic poetry such as that of
Hesiod and epic poetry such as that of Homer. Havelock (1986) famously argued that these
were so entrenched in the mind-set of classical Greek culture that Plato’s real purpose in
banning poets from his imaginary Republic was to prevent such traditional lore from being
equally inﬂuential in his proposed ideal society, preventing the growth of his “forms” of
new knowledge. Although Havelock may have overemphasized the pragmatic educational
value of epic poetry, clearly its role in providing a grand narrative of presumed historical
value to Greek society is clear.
While it is no longer widely accepted that the works of Plato mark the boundary
between oral and written communication, and media theorists now agree that there must
have been a longer and more gradual transition over time (Gibson 2005), Collins’s mag-
isterial work on the sociology of philosophy (1998) also posits that much of the cognitive
advances in the ﬁeld stemmed from the spoken and remembered exchanges over time
by seminal thinkers such as Plato and the short chains of students who conveyed those
thoughts into future generations through their own teaching.
Most of the scholarly attention to Walter Ong’s classic trilogy (1967, 1977, 1982)
focused on the gradual development and impact of literacy, but the importance of oral
communication itself is now well established. As Ong noted, the inﬂuence of a technol-
ogized print culture has affected almost all traditional performance-based oral cultures,
though certain traces of it still exist in even the most print-acculturated societies, notably
in areas such as law, literature, and religion. There is also a growing realization that oral

5.2
Oral Traditions
69
and print cultures co-exist, forming a continuum rather than the sharp dichotomy hypoth-
esized earlier (Goody 2000). The early presence and prevalence of pseudepigraphy (that
is, those manuscripts deliberately and incorrectly attributed to ancient authors) testify to
this continuum, in that many of these falsiﬁed works were purportedly “authored” in light
of ancient oral originals in order to enhance their legitimacy (Lange 2010).
As scholars such as Lord (1969), Finnegan (1970), and Foley (1988) discovered, traces
of ancient oral traditions also remain in narratives from a variety of cultures, ranging from
the Homeric epics of Greece (Ready 2019), to India’s Mahabharata (Blackburn et al.
1989) to Africa’s Ntsomi performances (Scheub 1970). These epic tales have been found
to focus on crucial events and personages, and, although usually narrated with a particular
order and emphasis, rely on the absorbing presentation of communal cultural concepts and
characterizations accepted by the audience rather than on either rote recitation or novel
interpretation.
Foley (1992, p. 178) argued that, in a truly oral culture, this traditional “word-power”
also engages contexts and mediated communication during what he termed “the enabling
event—performance—and the enabling referent—tradition—that give meaning to word-
power. Like the coinage created to carry this metonymic burden, the investigation has
two interlocking primary responsibilities: the problem of deﬁning what a ‘word’ is in this
communicative medium and the coordinate task of locating and explaining its peculiar
‘power’.” Words in an oral culture are not deﬁned by marks on a page but rather by
their particular performance in particular places. He noted also that the power of these
words varies in different contexts and cultures. In the bardic recitations of Homeric epics,
for instance, the bard’s ability to draw on an audience’s existing stock of knowledge by
making references, often couched in the form of familiar epithets such as “grey-eyed
Athena,” produced a much richer experience than is possible for the present-day reader
encountering the text without such socialization. Nidich (2016), in her examination of
early Hebrew oral traditions that inﬂuenced the creation of seminal biblical texts, further
suggests that an awareness of these referential traditions and their reception is important
both in understanding them and avoiding the imposition of modern normative ideas upon
these narratives.
Speech-act theory (Austin 1962; Searle 1969), with its focus on performative speech,
can be viewed as an archaeology of the oral tradition, in which verbal promises preceded
written contracts both in time and in tenure. One example is the Hippocratic oath in its
earliest form as recorded in the ﬁfth century BC, which included certain key words that
endure almost intact in its modern form (“do no harm”) while others (“treat the children of
the one who taught me this art as my own brothers”) have fallen into disuse, showing how
the performance of the medical practitioner over time has evolved from an apprenticeship
into a profession.
The early Anglo-Saxons used charms as “word magic” to invoke supernatural assis-
tance in their attempts to exert control over their environments (Arnovick 2006, p. 30).
A lesser known form of this presumed performative power of words is that of curses,

70
5
Rites, Religions
a surprising number of which have survived from ancient times in written form (Gager
1992). Healing words too as part of early medical treatments played a larger part in the
development of medicine than is generally recognized (Bishop 2007). Similarly, the use
of saints’ names in both prayers for intercession and in the taking of oaths was a com-
mon feature of medieval societies, showing the importance attached to particular names
perceived as holy (Bartlett 2013). In Islam, the use of the Durood Sharif blessing upon
any invocation of the Prophet Mohammad’s name continues to be widespread today.
The importance of “word power” and rote memorization in these oral cultures is under-
scored by its survival in religious teaching. Even in modern societies, children are often
indoctrinated at a very young age in particular belief systems by instruction in traditional
formulaic recitations, such as the Vedic mantras in Hinduism, the catechism questions
and responses of Catholicism, the Kiddush blessings of Judaism, or the obligatory Salat
prayers of Islam. These belief systems offer evidence of the importance of the oral tradi-
tions in establishing and maintaining thought regimes throughout history, by focusing on
a divine “word” as transmitted through elders, prophets, priests, or other religious author-
ities, with direct effects on the maintenance of social order, the creation of laws, and the
development of hierarchies.
Even presumably divinely delivered words, whatever their origins, have been subjected
to interpretation, whether this is exempliﬁed by ritual poetry about the Vedic hymns
(Jackson 2005) or by the Abhidhamma Pit.aka, which remains the classic commentary
on Buddhist sutras. As these interpretations are conveyed over time, distinctions still con-
tinue to be made between the original oral and subsequent written channels of diffusion,
usually favoring the oral ones, such as the preference for the so-called oral Torah above
the written Torah for legal decisions within the rabbinate (Jaffee 1997), the tradition of
the superiority of the spoken Qur’an in its original language to all written transcriptions
and translations (Small 2011), and the continuance of otherwise unused early languages
in the forms of ecclesiastical Latin in the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church and
Koine Greek in the ceremonies of the Greek Orthodox Church.
5.3
Ritual Writings
Despite the value placed on the spoken word, the growth and sustainability of religious
and other traditional authority, however, eventually required the evolution of additional
cognitive tools to supplement even the most sophisticated of memorization and rhetorical
practices. The development of cuneiform in Mesopotamia, the development of hiero-
glyphics in Egypt, and the development of Shang script in China all represented more
sophisticated logographic writing systems, in which each picture was an ideogram that
could be considered “key” to its particular content, whether it was sag (head), pictured in
cuneiform, ankh (life) pictured in hieroglyphics, or fu (husband) in Shang script. Such an
extensive “key word” vocabulary necessitated the presence of a scribal or priestly class

5.3
Ritual Writings
71
capable of memorizing the hundreds (and, for Shang, thousands) of individual words
depicted in these systems, which were largely used for ceremonial purposes.
One ingenious cognitive tool still in use today is the I-Ching (Book of Changes) used in
ancient Chinese divination practices, which used “trigrams,” comprised of eight different
three-line symbols (each comprised of patterns of solid and broken lines) to represent
natural phenomena. These trigrams were then doubled to form 64 individual “hexagrams”
to denote particular phenomena that were used in predictions. Thus, the trigrams served
as an index to the hexagrams, as the meanings of each symbol (Humphreys 2011).
Yet another cognitive tool in widespread religious use is the alphabet. The Kabbalah,
with its mystical approach to the Hebrew alphabet, represents an example of how lin-
guistic formulae and ritual could be viewed as manipulating reality (Harari 2019, p. 73).
Notable among the acrostic psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in
subsections named after the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, each section consisting
of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire
psalm consisting of 22×8 = 176 verses, the longest “chapter” in the Hebrew Bible. This
psalm also famously references the Torah (or “Law”) in each of its verses and is ﬁrmly
embedded within Jewish tradition (Berger 2006). Within Christian tradition, the alphabet
sublimates “the beginning and the end” as symbolized by the Alpha and Omega (the ﬁrst
and last letters of the Greek alphabet) in 21:6 of the Revelations of John. Despite this, in
medieval times alphabetical order was considered contrary to divine order, which would,
for instance, inevitably place Adam before Abel, because biblically correct chronologies
took precedence over merely alphabetical order, considered appropriate mostly for lesser
purposes, such as in reference to the lower orders of creation (Carruthers 1990; Clanchy
1993).
Experimentation over time with various writing surfaces, such as animal hides, bam-
boo, bone, bronze, clay, silk, stone, wax, and wood, and the invention of writing
technologies, such as the stylus and ink, also led to the development of new forms of
religious deixis, such as making the name of a god or king appear larger and more legible.
Early forms of highlighting “key words” included the use of special formats for impor-
tant words, such as the opening words of ritual spells in the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
which were inscribed in colored pigment rather than black (Blumel 2009) and painting a
red background for the names of demons in a papyrus fragment from the Tebtunis Temple
library (Ryhol 2018).
Rubrication, in which colored pigments (usually red) were also used to indicate par-
ticularly important words and other textual elements in early Christian manuscripts, also
became more common (Smith 2010). These “nomina sacra” in early Christian texts of the
second and third century also used special Greek abbreviations for a few particular words,
such as “Jerusalem” and “Jesus,” in place of the more usual variants (Hurtado 2006). This
practice may have begun as a variation of the Jewish practice of using the Tetragramma-
ton (a four-letter transliteration of the Hebrew name for Jehovah) to satisfy the religious

72
5
Rites, Religions
prohibition against speaking or viewing the holy name directly, but in the Christian con-
text it instead became a way to quickly identify and emphasize speciﬁc sanctiﬁed words,
particularly in public readings.
Carruthers (1990) explains that the extensive use of illustration in medieval Christian
manuscripts also became a way for Church authorities to signpost signiﬁcant passages
for the devout, regardless of their level of literacy, similar to the use of stained glass
windows and cathedral design to support liturgical rites. She argues that medieval liter-
acy differed from modern literacy in that a medieval reader did not distinguish between
personal experience and experience gained through reading in the same way that a mod-
ern reader does, precisely because of the extensive meditation and memorization required
in the consumption of devotional texts (1990, p. 160). Preaching for the ediﬁcation of
the faithful involved both rhetorical and intellectual skills in elucidating various bibli-
cal passages through allegory, metaphor, and literal interpretation for both educated and
non-educated listeners according to accepted doctrine (Menache and Horowitz 1996).
According to Burke (2000), the ultimate goal of education during the medieval period
was to make orthodox doctrine the foundation of all knowledge. Although this educational
goal is clearly no longer relevant to much of the modern world, it has not disappeared,
as its similarities are apparent in educational endeavors in different forms of contempo-
rary religious environments, such as the Hasidic yeshiva, the Islamic madrasa, and the
Christian fundamentalist school.
The creation of concordances to various “divine words” also has a long history: Jewish
scholars in Jerusalem were initially entrusted with the accurate oral transmission of the
Hebrew Biblical text and, by the fourth century were also responsible for its standardized
written transmission. The Hebrew Bible then accumulated numerous thematic word-lists
(the so-called Mesocratic notes), which often consisted of a key Bible word and the phrase
in which it occurred, arranged in the canonical order of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible,
and then by the section in which the word appears (Weinberg 1997, 2001). This remained
a satisfactory solution to most Jewish scholarship until a true concordance to the Hebrew
Bible was compiled by 1445 by Isaac Nathan, primarily as an aid to countering Christian
argumentation rather than as a real necessity of Jewish scholarship.
The ﬁrst concordance in Latin to the Vulgate Bible was compiled by 1244 by Domini-
can monks as an aid to Christian preachers in need of speciﬁc Biblical verses, while the
ﬁrst concordance to the English language Tyndale Bible was viewed as heretical and its
compiler, John Marbeck, narrowly avoided being burnt at the stake in 1544, though his
concordance was eventually published in 1550. The ﬁrst concordance to the English lan-
guage King James Bible was created single-handedly by bookseller Alexander Cruden in
1734 and is still in use today (Keay 2005).
The Qur’an, however, in accordance with its believers’ strict reliance on accurate mem-
orization, the intricate relationships among its various verses, and complexities of the
Arabic language did not prompt the production of written concordances until the end

of the nineteenth century, and these originally existed only as unpublished manuscripts
(Hairutdinov 2016; Kokabi 2011).
Of course, the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions all possess extensive bodies of
exegesis (that is, critical interpretation or explanation of a speciﬁc text) originating in rab-
binic midrash and peshat on the Torah (Benin 2003) and Talmudic scholarship (Samely
2007), early patristic exegesis of the Christian Gospels (Simonetti 1994), medieval
scholasticism (Dufal 2020), and tafsir commentaries on Qur’anic verses (Burge 2015)
respectively. The practice of exegesis itself is continually undergoing change, as new
interpretative methodologies are developed and reﬁned.
The meaning of religious keywords continues to inspire debate, as demonstrated, for
instance, by the multiple deﬁnitions of particular characters in the Confucian Analects,
which have undergone generations of commentary in the past two millennia as to how the
deﬁnition might impact the speciﬁcs of a particular saying by the sage (Xiao 2007) or by
the doctrine of “abrogation” (whether certain verses of the Qur’an can be considered to
have been superseded by later ones), which has been debated by Islamic commentators
for centuries (McAuliffe 2006).
We may view religious keywords, therefore, as falling into three main categories:
the imperative (commands), performative (rituals), and the interpretive (explanations).
Imperative keywords mandate general cognitive requirements for members of a speciﬁc
religious group, whether these requirements are, for instance, to reﬂect on daily actions
or inactions in relation to the requirements, or to comprehend that no boundaries exist
between physical and spiritual worlds, or to accept that each individual is capable of
enlightenment. Performative keywords mandate speciﬁc behavioral requirements, whether
these involve dietary practices, holy wars, or marriage ceremonies. Interpretive keywords
explain the connections among all of these in accordance with the particular belief sys-
tem, sometimes by means of traditional legends, sometimes by cryptic aphorisms, and
sometimes by elaborate exegesis.
Examples of imperative keywords from one of the earliest religions are those of the
Jain dharma, which mandate ahim. s¯a (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing),
brahmacharya (sexual continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness) as a way of life.
An example of performative keywords from the medieval Christian period are the many
European sermons that invoked the importance of “crusades” against perceived “inﬁdels”
or “heretics” as a way of achieving divine favor (Gaposchkin 2017; Valenin 2019). An
example of interpretive keywords from the early modern African period is “Ubuntu,”
which describes the signiﬁcance of group solidarity on the basis of survival as the essence
of being African, transcending beyond a narrow Western view of individualism to a holis-
tic African outlook that recognizes four basic attributes of human beings: human dignity
and equality, universal brotherhood, sacredness of life, and “Being” as the most desirable
state of life (Fagunwa 2019).
The importance of religious keywords has not diminished in today’s globalized com-
munication societies, as they still serve to arouse emotion and to mobilize both social

and political action within Christian (Burge and Williams 2019), Hindu (Thomas 2021),
Islamic (Rifat et al. 2022), Jewish (Osterbur and Kiel 2021), and other religious commu-
nities, even as much of society has become increasingly secularized and globalized in its
communications, as will be explored in the next chapter.

Writing, Indexing
Abstract
This chapter describes the development of writing, the diffusion of alphabetic tech-
nologies, the creation of administrative, legal, and theocratic structures dependent
on written communication, and the growing importance of textual interpretation and
information retrieval methods with the expansion of knowledge made possible by the
invention of printing, the increased international transmission of manuscripts, books,
and news, and a gradual increase in literacy leading into the early modern era.
The primary preservation of keywords has been through writing: “a system of more or
less permanent marks used to represent an utterance in such a way that it can be recovered
more or less exactly without the intervention of the utterer” (Daniels 2007). This chapter
discusses the evolution of writing and the various ways in which key concepts have been
distinguished as key words over the millennia.
6.1
The Rise of Writing
The prototype of all dictionaries today was the lists of Sumerian words (up to 1400) with
their Akkadian equivalents, written in cuneiform script on clay tablets roughly 4700 years
ago (Klein 2015). Based on archaeological evidence from the ﬁrst half of the second
millennium BCE, Egyptian hierographic and hieratic logographic systems seemed to have
inﬂuenced the creation of the ﬁrst phonemic system, known as the proto-Canaanite, by
providing a few ideograms, such as “ox” (“aleph”) and “water” (“net”) that were borrowed
as the initial sounds for the letters that eventually became A and M, resulting in a powerful
communication technology that diffused across the Near East in numerous local variations

of an alphabet. Although some variations died out over time, the resulting Arabic, Coptic,
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets all exist today in more modern forms.
Similarly, the characters of Chinese writing evolved over millennia from Shang dynasty
pottery inscriptions and diffused in various forms to other Asian languages, resulting in
more ﬂexible forms of writing. Chinese character organization involves a logic which
groups the roughly 214 “radicals” which are free-standing graphical character-words, by
the number of strokes, and which can then be combined with other characters to create
other words.
Alphabetical order in Western written culture was also established fairly early though
not nearly as strictly enforced as in the modern sense, often conﬁned only to the ﬁrst
letter of a word (Daly 1967). The Stoic philosopher Quintius Sextus originally organized
his Pythagorean Sentences by the so-called “catch words” from each sentence, though
later editors eventually rearranged these into alphabetical order by the ﬁrst word of each
sentence, demonstrating the gradual shift between mnemonic recital and visual retrieval,
which would eventually culminate in the critical importance of “known order” in indexing
(Witty 1973).
The Greeks inherited the order of the letters when they adopted and adapted an alpha-
bet for their own language. Abcedaries for the use of children existed at least as early
as the eighth century B.C. (West 2015). Goody (2000) argued that the alphabet was
instrumental in the development of Greek philosophy, as writing can preserve unchanged
opinions throughout time, and individuals can thus take a critical stance toward them,
separating themselves from the inherited discourse. The earliest example of this can be
found in Aristotle’s Metaphysics, which reports the opinions of his predecessors as well
as his own. The very rediscovery of the works of Aristotle in the twelfth century A.D. by
the Christian intellectual world was only made possible by their written preservation in
the Arabic world.
Like early Greek ritual, Greek law was originally oral in nature (Gagarin 2003). With
the development of writing and the growth of Greek city-states, legal regulations gradu-
ally became distinguished from other unwritten rules and traditions by being permanently
inscribed in stone and prominently displayed in public (2003, pp. 70–71). Similarly,
Roman law underwent a transition from a performative set of legal actions in which the
repetition of exact words and gestures, similar in nature to ritual religious practices, was
essential for legality, to the creation and display of the Twelve Tablets stating the laws as
they applied to all inhabitants of Rome (Meyer 2004). This was particularly important, in
that most Graeco-Roman writing was done on wax tablets, which were easily erased and
reused, and not generally intended for long-term storage (Small 1997).
Butler (2002) notes that the Roman public “spectacle” continued to include a vari-
ety of deliberate semiotic as well as semantic elements, making the concept of ancient
“literacy” far more complex than commonly understood today. What MacMullen (1982)
termed “the sense of audience” refers to the intended effect of Roman statues and monu-
mental inscriptions in public places for both literate and illiterate spectators. The public

display by Mark Antony in the Forum of the severed head and hands of his assassinated
rival Cicero, serving as graphic rebuttal of Cicero’s spoken and written works on the
Roman republic, was clearly intended to have a similarly dramatic effect on his audience.
Ironically, Cicero’s inﬂuence on the future, exerted through his consideration of both the
epistemological and rhetorical role of “evidence” in his book, Orator, was to play an even
greater role, as his writings became central to the classical foundations of grammar, logic,
and rhetoric in medieval learning (Lancaster & Raiswell, 2018). Indeed, his letters to his
friend Atticus also provided the ﬁrst use of the term “scholia” speciﬁcally in reference to
a gloss or comment contained within a particular manuscript (Reeve, 2016).
Authors and copyists of other early manuscripts began to organize their contents
through the emergence of abstracts and tables of contents, though these are often omitted
from their modern editions (Gibson, 2014). Witty (1973) dates the origins of abstracting
from the hypotheses (plot summaries) of classical Greek plays as preserved in papyri at
the Library of Alexandria. Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, an early encyclopedic work
of science, offered a “summarium” or table of contents as its Book I, but, as Doody (2010)
notes, its purpose was more generally introductory to natural history than indexical to spe-
ciﬁc facts. However, Pliny’s contemporary, the Greek military physician Dioscorides, did
produce an herbarium, the De Materia Medica, which was speciﬁcally devoted to the phar-
maceutical qualities of various plants, and was used as a medical reference source well
into the medieval period. The only surviving complete manuscript (known as the Codex
Vindobonensis) was produced in the sixth century and featured an alphabetical index to
the plant names for ready reference (Discorides 2000).
This more speciﬁc indexical approach was further developed as the codex replaced
the scroll across the Roman empire (Marchese 2012). Although there are various theories
concerning this gradual replacement of the scroll by the codex, many having to do with
its several advantages to the growing Christian textual community, which rapidly adopted
and diffused the new format (Roberts and Skeat 1987; Skeat 1994) or with reasons for
its more gradual acceptance by the elite in the larger population (Hartnett 2018), or with
the artisanal innovativeness shown by reworking existing storage technologies, such as
woven baskets, into containers for the earliest codex forms (Boudali 2018), there is gen-
eral consensus that the “book” provided novel access points to its contents, important to
those who needed to point quickly to particular, authoritative passages, ultimately giv-
ing it an advantage over other formats. As Kloppenborg (2014) notes, while certainly
possible, repeatedly locating any particular section of interest in a scroll was far more
difﬁcult. A codex, however, allowed primitive versions of random access information
retrieval through the use of bookmarks and marked book edges, for instance (Marchese
2012).
Similarly, in China, the use of writing on bamboo slats bound together into rolls,
had become routine by the Warring States period (481–256 B.C.), and facilitated the
voluminous works of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220). Paper was invented there
by the ﬁrst century B.C. and facilitated production of a broad range of manuscripts. By

the eighth century (at the latest), the Chinese had invented xylography, the technology
that reproduced text from characters cut in relief on wooden blocks. Developed ﬁrst for
the production of Buddhist texts, the technology gradually turned to the production of
dictionaries, medical texts, almanacs, astrological, divination and geomancy manuals, and
then to government printing, which established standard editions of the Confucian classics
in the tenth century. By the end of that century, with the establishment of a text-centered
civil service examination system as the primary means of ofﬁcial recruitment, literacy and
mastery of classic texts became routinized within the state bureaucracy (Brokaw 2007,
p. 254).

The Importance of Interpretation
Although Latin was not the only language in use as the Roman empire dissolved and
was succeeded by the early medieval period, it remained the lingua franca of scholar-
ship, providing a common framework for communication across Europe (McKitterick
1990), even as what was to become the vernacular English language transitioned through
Norse, Anglo-Saxon, Old English, Norman French, Middle English, and modern English
iterations, adopting and adapting words and grammatical constructions along the way
(Nevalainen et al. 2020). Ecclesiastical Latin dominated medieval thinking, however, and
the manuscript copying workshops (scriptoria) of the monastic houses, especially the
Dominicans, were the major sources of Biblical texts and theological manuscripts.
The thirteenth-century Dominican John Balbi constructed the Catholicon, which helped
to interpret Biblical words as well as Latin grammar for education within these monastic
houses, while the role of “word-lists” deﬁning speciﬁc terms became essential for those
not otherwise schooled in Latin.
The thirteenth-century Dominican Vincent of Beauvais is credited with the encyclo-
pedic work Speculum Maius, intended as a compendium of universal knowledge. De
Beauvais’s pioneering effort included the attachment of a list of topics in alphabeti-
cal order (tabulae) to each of the four parts of the Speculum, providing a “facilitatis
inveniendi” that mapped particular book and chapter locations to each topic, as even
the best-trained memory would be unable to retain that much knowledge, although, as
Rouse and Rouse (1991, pp. 191–255) observe, a well-laid-out manuscript coupled with
a well-trained memory remained essential for medieval scholars through the thirteenth
century.
The use of “glosses” to explain or interpret an authoritative text, such as the Bible or
the legal Code of Justinian, became more prevalent as well. These glosses were initially
placed between the lines or in the margins of the original texts, but eventually some took
a more independent form. Such collections as Lombard’s Four Books of Sentences, which
compiled authoritative statements on theologically important biblical passages and which
marked the beginnings of systematic theology (Rouse and Rouse 1991, pp. 191–219),

and Gratian’s Decretum, which compiled signiﬁcant legal precedents from both canon
and Roman law (Winroth 2021), the so-called sedes materiae (the seat of the matter),
became foundational to medieval scholasticism in an attempt to harmonize the various
authorities of their own tradition and to reconcile Christian theology with the philosophers
of classical and late antiquity. The ultimate aim was to determine divine truth and human
obligation as evidenced through these texts, which included the Bible, the writings of the
Church Fathers, the works of certain philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, and the
two corpora of Roman and canon law.
Within medieval law, the so-called “Glossators” developed a fairly consistent and uni-
form system, based on the belief that numbers were too hard to remember and not suitable
for the oral disputations in which lawyers frequently engaged. The earliest uniform prac-
tice of the Glossators was to give ﬁrst a siglum (symbol) representing the work: after the
siglum, the ﬁrst few words of the rubric (a subject heading usually written in red ink)
of the title were given, followed by the initium (the opening words) of the lex and, if
necessary, of the paragraph. Numbers were only occasionally used. This early method,
though with greater use of numbers, was also adopted by canon lawyers, especially after
the compilation of the decretals by Gratian around 1140. One of the earliest methods to
refer to a legal document was to quote the opening words or incipit, much as the Glos-
sators used the initia. Writs often took names from their opening words, and this was one
of the earliest methods of referring to statutes (Cooper 1982).
For other scholarly purposes, Parkes (1976) notes that the growing sophistication of
the later medieval book can be traced to the rise of scholasticism in the medieval univer-
sities. Scholastic logic required an apparatus of thesis statements along with explanations
of terms and the arguments involved, resulting in the creation of a more organized struc-
ture for books, including an accepted order of hierarchy for individual topics and their
subtopics, and an increasing emphasis on both original texts and a growth of compila-
tions and commentaries. The proliferation of compilations also promoted the development
of the so-called “tabula,” alphabetical indices to their contents, which were organized
by selected and deﬁned catchwords from the topics and subtopics. These tabula could
refer to a single work or to multiple related works in the context of related arguments
(1976, pp. 131–132). Medieval “authorship” of such compilations was also “editorial”:
it involved separating the subject matter hierarchically into quaestiones and distinctiones,
but also involved the design of each page, using visual cues to mark divisions. Ideally, the
handwritten book served as a physical mirror of the internal structure of its contents and
the scholar’s memory accordingly reﬂected what was read (1976, p. 121). The printing of
the ﬁrst Gutenberg Bible in 1441 using movable metal type was gradually to revolutionize
such scholarly practices as well (Eisenstein 1983).
Alphabetical indices themselves were somewhat disdained by many scholars, presum-
ably because they represented a more mechanical aid to memory than it was felt someone
with truly scholarly mastery of an entire subject should require (Zedelmaier 2007). Such

84

Writing, Indexing
retention through memory alone, however, became increasingly difﬁcult with the “renais-
sance” of new knowledge into the West from the East in the form of new translations
from ancient sources and novel works in such ﬁelds as mathematics and medicine (Nelles
2009). By the fourteenth century, if a manuscript was not supplied with this type of
organized structure, scholarly readers were beginning to add some of the organizational
apparatus speciﬁc to an individual copy, but, by the ﬁfteenth century, even secular works
often enjoyed an analytical table of contents, text disposed into books, chapters, and para-
graphs, accompanied by footnotes and an index that often contained “see also” notations
(Parkes 1976, pp. 134–135).
The growth of scholarship, facilitated by the so-called “Republic of Letters” represent-
ing an international correspondence network (which continued to be conducted mostly in
Latin) among learned and aristocratic individuals in the West, is exempliﬁed by the Dutch
theologian Erasmus, who ﬁrst popularized the term in his 1495 Antibarbari (Book Against
the Barbarians), an argument for the embrace of classical languages and learning in order
to enhance Christian intellectual endeavors (Burke 1999). This ongoing exchange of let-
ters and manuscripts helped to bring new translations and new ideas for the humanities,
mathematics, philosophy, and science into circulation across Europe.
In 1545, Conrad Gessner, the “father of bibliography,” listed, annotated, and evalu-
ated 10,000 works in his Bibliotheca Universalis (Nelles 2009, p. 150). The Bibliotheca
contained two alphabetical lists of its authors and an index. The second volume, the Pan-
dectae (1548), contains a section with a list of keywords, ordered thematically to the
ﬁrst volume, as well the ﬁrst known instructions on index construction (“De indicibus
librorum”) intended to help scholars process textual material. Gessner recommended that,
during the reading process, anything that appeared important or useful was to be writ-
ten on a piece of paper as it was encountered, later to be cut into individual slips, and
arranged in any desired order, after which they could be copied, or pasted onto another
sheet, or inserted into a special binding for purposes of retention (Zedelmaier 2007). Kra-
jewski (2011) points out that these cards can be considered as forming an early “paper
machine” that facilitated random information retrieval from multiple books, similar to but
more powerful than the index within a single book, but not as powerful as the computing
machines to come.
6.3
The Literacy Revolution
Meanwhile, vernacular languages began to replace Latin on the continent as well as in
England, necessitating more vernacular words to express various concepts, often called
“hard words” because they were both novel and complex. The phrase “hard words” would
appear to have been used for the ﬁrst time in the title of John Day’s glossary A gatheryng
of certayne harde wordes in the newe Testament, with their exposicion (1551), translated
from the expression mot difﬁciles used in the original French title of this work, which was

6.3
The Literacy Revolution
85
one of the study aids produced in advance of the famous Geneva Bible of 1560, featuring
an extensive apparatus of indices and commentaries for the Protestant reader. The use
of the phrase “hard words” later came to carry a political connotation, indicating their
borrowed rather than naturalized status as English words, indicating to some observers
that these were terms used by the elite and therefore should be adopted and to others
that they were foreign and therefore suspect. The rapid increase in the English lexicon
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, due to the adoption of foreign terms, the
adaptation of foreign terms to create their English equivalents, and the need for new terms
to indicate new ideas in religion, science, geography, medicine, and literature eventually
generated a term of its own: the “inkhorn” controversy over the use of such words (Durkin
2014, pp. 317–319).
While there continued to be marked differences in education between the landed (Levy
1982) and the laboring (Laqueur 1976) classes, the rudiments of literacy became increas-
ingly available to more people over time. Accounts of witchcraft trials, for instance, were
aimed at both literate and semi-literate audiences (Suhr 2012). Written handbooks for
the use of magic and witchcraft and for their discovery and prevention became available,
though the grimoires (a term used for occult handbooks) were usually handwritten and
carefully concealed from other readers (Orgel 2017) while the witch-ﬁnders’ handbooks
such as the celebrated Hammer of Witches became increasingly popular as they found
their way into print (Broedel 2010). It should be remembered that expressing disbelief in
demonology and witchcraft even during the early modern era might also provide cause
for accusations of heresy (Clark 1997). Church inquisitors were notoriously adept at using
their extensive records of interrogations in order to entrap victims (Sherwood 2012).
While heterodox as well as various heretical beliefs gained access to written as well
as oral channels of communication, and more of the population became literate, both the
content and the indices of works also began to provide different perspectives on what
might be considered knowledge (Biller 1994). Censorship by both church and state con-
tinued to pose an ongoing danger to many forms of innovative thought, ranging from
medicine (Marcus 2020) to politics (Loades 1974) to science (Marcus and Findlen 2019)
and, of course, to theology (Watson 1995). Even translators of such works ran the risk
of imprisonment and execution. Although some have argued that that the invention of the
printing press in the early ﬁfteenth century was not the unique genesis of the so-called
“print culture” (Love 2003), printing dramatically impacted the transmission of knowl-
edge, also making it easier to censor certain works such as the Talmud and rabbinical
scholarship (Morsel-Eisenberg 2021) and to broaden the circulation of others, such as
Arthurian legends and classic myths (Wang 2004). It also helped to facilitate the domina-
tion of non-Western cultures through colonialism, as the printed book became associated
with the privileging of Western forms of literacy over other forms of writing (Mignolo
1995).

86

Writing, Indexing
Printing allowed the alphabetical index to assume additional importance, in that what
was originally intended as an aid to personal memory for an individual using a particu-
lar manuscript became a contribution to social memory, as the format of printed books
became more uniform than their handwritten predecessors. Cevolini (2014) analyzes the
evolution of indexing itself and ﬁnds it among the most important knowledge manage-
ment tools of the typographic age, showing how both cognitive performance and social
media can be shaped by communication media.
Cevolini comments that “The transition from manuscript to printed texts triggered a
functional change that worked as a selective force on indexing procedures, turning a
mnemotechnical aid into a search engine of virtual memories” (2014, p. 51). Now a more
standardized, less idiosyncratic index could allow any reader not only to compensate for
limitations imposed by a failure to remember where in the text a speciﬁc word or passage
of note occurred, but also offered an opportunity to innovate through the discovery of
particular words or passages not reached through typical linear reading. In other words,
the evolution of the index was from a memory tool relevant to a pre-selected compilation
of authorized texts to a ﬁnding tool for novel ideas. The art of memory gradually gave
way to a science of information retrieval, as the amount of potential knowledge became, in
Blair’s phrase “too much to know” (Blair 2010) for any one individual, and card indices,
archives, and libraries all became more prevalent over time.
These technologies of deixis served as black boxes of exteriorized, virtual memory for
those with both access and appropriate knowledge management skills. The “art of seman-
tic association as practised by orators was now replaced by the somewhat mechanical
procedure of the alphabetical register, leaving users to take their bearings from the terms
from which the index was constructed through semantic paths. Information retrieval took
place in a ‘methodical’ manner, through clear and simple rules that allowed for a pro-
gressive increase in knowledge without weighing down the mind” (Cevolini 2014, p. 54).
The evolution of these technologies of deixis also gradually created what we might term
a “new world order” in which printing only gradually displaced handwritten manuscripts,
borrowing many of their existing structures while standardizing and lending more preci-
sion to such formats as page numbering, and revolutionizing the social production and
consumption of knowledge, as the “key words” from the variety of chapters and titles
that formed the infrastructure of both book indices and library catalogs allowed more
freedom in forming and informing new thoughts and different ways of thinking (Dover
2021; Eisenstein 1983; McKitterick 2003).
While records administration practices by church and state varied widely by region,
they too were generally becoming more sophisticated, as documents were perceived as
increasingly essential to legal and political operations. Registries were set up to track the
ﬂow of documents related to particular areas of government, letter-books were created
to contain copies of the documents with notes regarding their contents and any actions
taken in response, chronological order was maintained by binding these letter-books into
codices to improve access, separate inventories were developed for additional security

6.3
The Literacy Revolution
87
against forgery and theft, and special cabinets were built to house these in various ofﬁcial
repositories (Head 2016).
The slow shift toward both intellectual and political freedom also manifested itself in
a growing interest in news, as traditional oral news transmission methods (village gossip,
town criers announcing royal edicts, sung ballads about notorious events, etc.) became
supplemented by written communications, such as the coranto broadsheets that began to
appear around 1620 providing updates on European battles and politics and which were
the predecessors of newspapers a century later. Increasing literacy fueled this growth
as well, provoking an increase in censorship on printed materials of all types, though
these attempts at news censorship were often unsuccessful (Espejo 2011). Pamphlets and
newspapers attempted to stress their novelty, credibility, and timeliness to prospective
audiences through title page and paragraph design, and eventually through the creation of
newspaper headlines, while their audiences began to respond more actively to what they
were learning about events, governance, and society (Barker 2014).
Such different ways of thinking gradually came to include more scientiﬁc habits of
mind and more politically charged forms of expression, though both were deeply rooted
in earlier cognitive endeavors. For individuals, the keeping of the so-called “commonplace
books” did indeed become commonplace, as the process was gradually transformed from
an earlier scholastic endeavor in which pupils were rigorously drilled in the still-dominant
classic traditions by transcribing selected Greek and Latin extracts into elegant English
prose in order to learn the principles of rhetoric and argument, into a much more individu-
alized one in which both men and women transcribed various literary, poetic, or religious
quotations of particular interest and the thoughts that these engendered into their personal
notebooks for future reﬂection. Erasmus wrote De Copia in 1512, which suggested exten-
sive reading, note-taking, and careful thought would facilitate this new type of learning
from a variety of printed sources. Philosopher John Locke’s 1706 A New Method of Mak-
ing Common-Place Books also urged the use of consistent order in constructing these,
with the goals of better of understanding principles of organization and better retention
of the contents. The compilation of commonplace books continued to provide structure
for students as they absorbed familiar quotations and useful pieces of knowledge, though
without the early emphasis on classic authors and rhetorical arts as the ultimate model for
thinking (Moss 1996). Mass literacy required different modes of teaching and learning
than did earlier forms of elite education (Vincent 2000).
As Lancaster and Raiswell (2018, p. 3) point out, “What is distinct about the early
modern period is that the cultural, social, and intellectual spaces in which knowledge was
generated and the ends to which it was brought were changing as new groups of people
developed new methods to solve a different set of problems. As these people came to
assert increasingly more control of the intellectual agenda in venues outside those tradi-
tionally associated with knowledge production in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, they
formulated new conceptions of what constituted acceptable proof, tested it in new social
and intellectual contexts, and found new roles for it in their arguments and worldviews.

88

Writing, Indexing
… In this way, the empirical, mathematical, geographical, natural philosophical, and his-
torical mixed with the authority of classical antiquity, Scripture, and analogous textual
traditions, along with the hermetic, legal, and medical, to beget new conceptions of evi-
dence. … Although the early modern period witnessed the notion of evidence as it would
later come to be understood in the modern sciences emerge, this process was far from
direct, and the form it took was anything but inevitable.”
For instance, the “science” of demonology that dominated the early modern period
“was a composite subject consisting of discussions about the workings of nature, the pro-
cesses of history, the maintenance of religious purity, and the nature of political authority
and order” (Clark 1997, p. viii). Caciola and Sluhovsky argue that earlier processes of
“discernment” of the preternatural world through the investigation of such supposed phe-
nomena as “witches’ marks” eventually paved the way for a more empirical approach
to the natural world by both physicians and scientists, while Daston (1998, p. 72) notes
“The most impressive machinery of proof and legitimation in early modern Europe was
to be found not in science but in religion, in the elaborate and reﬁned procedures used by
ecclesiastical authorities to investigate miracles. It is not an accident that Hume developed
his rules for the evaluation of the evidence of testimony and things in the context of an
inquiry into miracles.” This new focus on scientiﬁc enquiry as a method of establishing
credible evidence, moreover, helped to create appreciation for more accurate sources of
information of all kinds within the emerging “public sphere” in Western societies (Dooley
2001).
6.4
The Language of Science and the Science of Language
In his magisterial overview of language changes during the early modern era, Woot-
ton (2015) notes that The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge
quickly disclaimed any interest in investigating such things as demonic possession or
miraculous powers and its formation in 1660 is considered to mark the start of organized
scientiﬁc inquiry. However, even existing scientiﬁc language could be considered suspect:
for instance, alchemy provided much of the foundation for chemistry in the words that
were used to describe chemical processes (Nummedal 2011). The Society’s ﬁrst secre-
tary, John Wilkes, embarked on a project to provide a new classiﬁcatory language for
science and technology, which was intended to provide a means of universal communi-
cation for scientists and scholars that would be superior to Latin and all other languages
in that it would be based on universal laws that account for the natural world, and the
“things and notions” that are represented by them (Schulte-Albert 1979). Despite having
intrigued such luminaries as Locke, this project never came to full fruition and, instead, in
1704, the Royal Society’s other secretary, John Harris, compiled the ﬁrst English-language
encyclopedia, the Lexicon technicum, which also served as a dictionary of mathematics,
mechanical arts, and natural sciences (Lonati 2007).

6.4
The Language of Science and the Science of Language
89
The gradual development of scientiﬁc and technical vocabularies by working scien-
tists continued throughout the early modern era, shown by examples such as Lavoiser’s
early attempt to systematize chemical nomenclature (Wloch, 2015), Linnaeus’s binomial
nomenclature for botany (Müller-Wille and Charmantier 2012), and Messier’s catalog of
astronomical objects (Dick 2013). The development of a scientiﬁc vocabulary and asso-
ciated classiﬁcatory terms is generally considered the hallmark of an emerging scientiﬁc
ﬁeld as they facilitate the exchange of knowledge, even as both vocabularies and classiﬁ-
cations are subject to change as the particular science advances in knowledge. Starting in
1665, learned journals such as the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions in England
and the Journal des Scavans in France provided important channels of communication for
this ﬂood of new scientiﬁc information.
The modern encyclopedic genre dates from the 1700s, with the stated goal of con-
taining an encapsulated summary of all human knowledge as a substitute for multiple
books within a library, demonstrated by examples such as Chambers’ 1728 Cyclopedia,
Diderot’s 1751 Encyclopédie, and Smellie’s 1768 Encyclopedia Britannica. These were
all commercial multi-volume publications aimed at a wide public readership, providing
an ambitious range of subjects that went beyond traditional academic disciplines, and
usually offered an alphabetical arrangement of topics rather than the traditional systems
imposed by academic or theological hierarchies (Yeo 2007). These efforts were massive:
for instance, while the Lexicon Technicum contained roughly a million words, the Cyclo-
pedia contained 3 million, the Encyclopedia Britannica contained 10 million, and the
Encyclopédie 19 million (Loveland 2012).
An obvious problem for the encyclopedia’s user was the difﬁculty of locating speciﬁc
topics within a more general alphabetized list of subjects. Chambers addressed the prob-
lem of alphabetized headings and terms by providing a preliminary “View of Knowledge”
diagram, based on commonplace book organizational schemes with which encyclopedia
readers could be presumed to be familiar. Each subject shown in the diagram was linked
to a footnote containing a list of the terms belonging to it, so that, with cross-references,
the reader could reconstitute a science that had been scattered alphabetically. The dia-
gram showed 47 headings, numbered simply according to their position on the diagram.
The notes attached to each art or science show the cognate terms belonging to it in order
to help the reader locate a speciﬁc topic within various headings, and also a listing of
the suggested order in which these topics should be read. Roughly half of the articles
also contained cross-references to other relevant articles (Yeo 2003). An alternative solu-
tion was found by the editors of the Britannica, which included individual indices to its
lengthier subject treatments for its second edition.
The boundaries between encyclopedias and dictionaries have often been viewed as
porous but the development of lexicography as a separate ﬁeld helped to further sepa-
rate the two (Hancher 2019), even while the nature of “evidence” and the importance
of “organization” also clearly impacted the emerging study of words and their usage
(Mugglestone 2015). While medieval word-lists, such as the lists of Latin words with their

90

Writing, Indexing
vernacular equivalents for the use of students in monasteries and later in the universities,
had been common, the decline of Latin as a universal language prompted new lexico-
graphic endeavors for vernacular languages, beginning with John Florio’s 1598 Worlde
of Words, which attempted to singlehandedly if unsuccessfully undertake for the English
language what the contemporaneous scholarly groups of the Academie Francaise and the
Accademia della Crusca were attempting to legislate for the French and Italian languages
respectively (Considine 2014), expanded both by Thomas Blount’s exhaustive 1656 Glos-
sographia and by John Kersey’s 1702 emphasis on “common” rather than “hard” words
(Lancashire 2005), and reﬁned by Samuel Johnson’s 1755 Dictionary, which proposed
to identify both common and important words as deﬁned by distinguished writers and
acknowledged specialists (Osselton 2006).
The lexicographers who compiled the dictionaries of the seventeenth and eighteenth
century believed that the oldest meaning of a word was the most literal, which informed
much of their efforts to trace and record older uses of each word and to arrange them in a
coherent order. Although this belief was incorrect, it did help to systematize the practice
of dictionary-making (Hanks 2020). Roget’s Thesaurus represents the best known in a
series of earlier attempts to depict the connections among various words through the
organization of synonyms rather than through alphabetization (Hüllen 2003).
Kreidler (1998) points out that another dominant viewpoint among lexicographers was
that language diversity was undesirable, and that attempts should be made to “ﬁx” lan-
guage into a norm to which all educated individuals should conform. In the United States,
Noah Webster subscribed to these ideas, hoping the diffusion of correct usage would grad-
ually destroy the differences of dialect which had been brought from the British Isles.
Deeply inﬂuenced by the evangelical Christianity of the day, his 1828 dictionary’s pref-
ace incorporated the idea that that all languages are descended from the biblical “Chaldee”
and form three groups, Hamitic, Semitic, and Japhetic, to which English belonged.
As dictionaries evolved, it became clear that they faced continual challenges as words
became obsolete, changed meaning, or were replaced or joined by others reﬂecting new
concepts. The usefulness of dictionaries, as well as their prevalence, became vested not
only in their authoritativeness but in their comprehensiveness. The Oxford English Dictio-
nary, work on which began in 1857, is well known for its empirical approach, soliciting
input from a wide variety of contributors rather than relying on linguists and grammarians
(Winchester 2003) while still enforcing its own editorial discretion in adjudicating among
words and their deﬁnitions (Mugglestone 2005).
The diffusion of modern technologies can be tracked by the initial dates in the dictio-
nary for the published use of such neologisms as newspaper (1667), bureaucracy (1759),
telegraph (1793), steamship (1819), railroad (1822), analytical engine (1843), telephone
(1864), and typewriter (1868), all of which helped to accelerate the global growth of
communication. For instance, newspaper headlines increasingly served as “relevance opti-
mizers” in which to mobilize public opinion and actions (Dor 2003) while the telegraph
accelerated involvement in international affairs (Yeh 2015). Such key words from the

nineteenth century such as “colonization,” “Dred Scott decision,” and “l’affaire Drey-
fus” continue to resonate today, just as today’s keywords may do for future students and
researchers in those dictionaries and other textual corpora currently being compiled.
Lexicography itself, while retaining many of its traditional methods even as it has
transitioned to an almost completely electronic environment, is gradually being recon-
ceptualized as a result of new lexicographic theories, massively increased availability of
textual corpora and new ways of analyzing these, and the inﬂux of ideas from other
disciplines (Leroyer and Simonsen 2020).
The next chapter will describe the role of information, particularly scientiﬁc and tech-
nological information, as it contributed to commercial competition and the growth of
nation-states.

Abstract
This chapter describes the emphasis on organization and efﬁciency that resulted from
the rise of nation-states and international commercial competition during the latter
part of the nineteenth century and how this impacted the growth of science and tech-
nical knowledge and the operations of libraries, especially advances in bibliographic
cooperation and indexing technologies.
While the rise and dominance of the factual in modern times have often been sepa-
rately explained as a result of economic advances (Poovey 1998), educational structures
(Vincent 2000), political pressures (Buzan and Lawson 2015), scientiﬁc progress (Kitcher
1993), and societal conditioning (Latour 2012), all of these clearly played a part in
the speciﬁc directions taken in the creation, collection, and dissemination of public
knowledge.
7.1
The Growth of Governments and the Push Toward Progress
The growth of governments throughout the latter part of the nineteenth century increas-
ingly required the utilization of sets of standardized and aggregated facts such as national
censuses (Scott 1998). Census methodologies had developed over time, shifting from
local, to regional, to national levels, from simple counts of all residents to nominal list-
ings of household heads with numeric information about other household residents, then
to census lists with individual names and data for all persons. The national information
requirements for military recruitment, imposition of taxes, civic activities, demographic
trends, and provision of social services grew more sophisticated, with modernized census
techniques being widely employed by the 1840s, though attempts at global standardization

of census measurements through such efforts as the International Statistical Conferences,
held from 1853 through 1872, failed due to resistance by individual governments to inter-
ference with their own procedures (Emigh et al. 2016). Krajewski (2011, pp. 27–32)
makes an intriguing analogy between the era’s emphasis on the improvement of gov-
ernment censuses and the improvement of library collections in terms of the somewhat
similar problems in identifying and locating individual persons and in identifying and
locating individual books as both populations were rapidly growing.
Book and periodical indexing were becoming professionalized with the increase in
commercial publishing, the growth of national and specialized libraries, and the forma-
tion of professional library associations with their emphasis on bibliographic description
and cataloging. Subject access in particular had been problematic, as the organization of
any particular library’s contents tended to be local and often idiosyncratic. Even those
so-called “classiﬁed catalogs” in printed format that listed a library’s contents in a hier-
archical arrangement by subject used very broad categories, making the identiﬁcation of
books on speciﬁc subjects increasingly difﬁcult as the collection grew, further highlighting
issues of inefﬁciency within library processes.
In 1858, British publisher Samson Low released a retrospective catalog of all British
books printed between 1837 and 1857. This included several indices, one based on title-
term indexing, which identiﬁed the subject matter of a book by catchwords extracted from
its title. His assistant, Andrea Crestadoro, described this method in an 1856 pamphlet,
The Art of Making Catalogues of Libraries: Or, a Method to Obtain in a Short Time a Most
Perfect,Complete,andSatisfactoryPrintedCatalogoftheBritishMuseumLibrary, although
it was never in fact adopted by the British Museum Library, which was cataloging its
collection at the time under library director Antonio Panizzi’s 91 Rules for Compilation of
the Catalogue: a project which lasted a staggering 40 years.
Although title-term indexing was clearly a precursor to keyword indexing, the method
was quickly overshadowed by advances in other forms of subject classiﬁcation for
libraries, notably American Charles Cutter’s 1876 Rules for a Dictionary Catalog, which
solved one of the major problems in title-term indexing, which was the lack of a way
to identify synonyms for speciﬁc title terms. Cutter’s development of a subject authority
ﬁle was clearly superior to title-term indexing in regard to ﬁnding linkages to important
variations in terminology and eventually formed the basis for the Library of Congress
subject headings classiﬁcation system.
However, as Grifﬁths (2015, p. 135) points out, “There is an inherent tension between
the power of an expansive index to coordinate a wide range of materials and the limita-
tions of the embedded procedures that institutions use to decide what to index and how.
Expansions in scale bring this tension into crisis, as the increasing quantity of sources
demands qualitatively different procedures to draw them together. This problem of the
scalar transformation of print materials gained particular focus in the nineteenth century,
as institutions including the British Museum, the French Bibliothèque Nationale, and the

rapidly growing American Library of Congress built collections that surpassed a million
items by the close of the century.”
A start toward global bibliographic cooperation was made at the two international Con-
ferences of Librarians, the ﬁrst held in New York in September of 1877 and the second in
London in October of that same year. Topics of discussion included the recent appearance
of such professional library publications as Cutter’s Rules, Dewey’s 1876 A Classiﬁcation
and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library,
and the ﬁrst issue of Library Journal, with its call for international cooperation through
shared cataloging and indexing and the development of standardized formats, as expressed
both through British librarian J.A. Cross’s call for “A Universal Index of Subjects” to be
compiled from all existing published subject bibliographies, plus the subject cards or lists
from all British libraries, and American librarian William Poole’s call for both American
and English libraries to contribute individual indices from their own journal holdings to
be incorporated into his Index to Periodical Literature (Gambee 1967). Neither suggestion
was successfully implemented at the time, though innovations such as H.B. Wheatley’s
1878 guide to indexing, What is an Index? (Bell 2001), John Shaw Billings’s 1879 Index
Medicus, a regularly published index of important recent medical books and journal arti-
cles (Marson 1969), and John Butler Johnson’s 1884 Engineering Index abstracts (Landau
1984) soon began to appear.
The so-called search for order in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century
was also driven by new pragmatic and progressive ideas in politics that actively promoted
the use of scientiﬁc ﬁndings and technological advances intended to improve social well-
being (Wiebe 1967). Informed by these ideals, American librarian Henry Bliss developed
his Bliss Bibliographic Classiﬁcation as a socially conscious alternative to the Dewey
Decimal System (Broughton 2008) though it was not widely adopted in the United States.
However, the now-widely used term “knowledge organization” was also ﬁrst used by
Bliss in his two seminal books, The Organization of Knowledge and the System of the
Sciences (1929) and The Organizationof KnowledgeinLibraries (1933). All of this led to a
corresponding growth in the amounts of information being collected, archived, exchanged,
and exploited, with a consequent increased need for ﬁling and retrieval at almost all levels
of governmental, commercial, and educational institutions (Muddiman 2008).
Traditional forms of government document handling, such as the use of registers for
logging individual documents, the use of string-bound volumes in which to preserve them,
with minimal inventorying and indexing for the retrieval of these documents, began to
be replaced by the newly invented ﬁling cabinets and associated forms of indexing that
allowed easier access (Robertson 2021). For instance, patent ﬁlings for new inventions
increased dramatically during the late nineteenth century and became a global driver
of technological change (Pretel 2018). Words also accrued economic value during this
period, as trademarks and brand names were developed and legitimized through legal
protection (Mercer 2010) while, as intangible assets essential to a ﬁrm’s identity, they
facilitated the growth of the modern corporation (Wilkins 1992).

Progress, Public
As many American librarians were both inﬂuenced by and inﬂuential within the Pro-
gressive movement, libraries began to adopt and adapt these managerial techniques and
business-oriented vocabularies (Nardini 2001) while at the same time, certain library tech-
niques and technologies to improve efﬁciency, such as indexing and ﬁling systems and
equipment (Casey 1981) began to be widely adopted by other organizations (Flanzraich
1993). Vertical ﬁles replaced earlier ﬁling technologies as the preferred form of records
storage and card ﬁles became the preferred form of locating speciﬁc information (Yates
1993).
7.2
Cooperation and Competition
Nevertheless, limitations of even these novel library practices were becoming ever more
evident, as the imposition of international copyright restrictions, funding shortfalls faced
by expanding national libraries, the increasing necessity of translation among major Euro-
pean languages, and even the constraints imposed by the physicality of books and journals
all increased the complexity of the librarian’s task. This complexity was viewed by some
visionaries as obstacles to universal shared knowledge, which should be overcome by
various types of world-wide initiatives, although this ideal of open communication was
far from universally accepted (Crawford 1988). Adding to the complexity of the situation,
such pernicious theories as eugenics were prominent in the scientiﬁc communication of
the period (Kevles 2016) while theories of imperialism and colonialism were predominant
in political communications (Richards 1993).
This period prior to the First World War can also be said to mark the origins of the
division between “documentation” (a key word made popular by the work of Belgian
lawyer Paul Otlet, which focuses on documents or “information” within documents as
discrete units of interest) and “libraries” (a long-established key word which focuses on
the books and periodicals in which these are contained). The use of index cards as, in
Krajewski’s phrase, “paper machines” (2011) were to play a bridging role between these
different perspectives. Index cards offered a surprising amount of ﬂexibility in organizing
and ﬁnding for special purposes: in addition to the standardized card catalog ﬁles main-
tained in alphabetical order, cards themselves could be modiﬁed through trimming edges
or punching holes, connecting these to speciﬁed codes, words, or topics, allowing easy
retrieval from a card deck through use of a sorting spindle or, later, through “punch card”
machines designed to automate the process. This “coordinate” form of indexing through
individual terms contrasts with “subordinate” indexing, the form of library classiﬁcation
in which terms are subordinated to subject headings. “Pre-coordinate” refers to the origi-
nal assignment of terms in indexing; “post-coordinate” refers to the subsequent selection
of terms in searching. Theorizing these processes would later become fundamental to
library and information science.

7.2
Cooperation and Competition
101
The best-known effort to advance global knowledge sharing was launched by Paul
Otlet and Henri La Fontaine in Belgium in 1895, with their Universal Bibliographic
Repertory (UBR), a collection of index cards with an eventual 15 million entries summa-
rizing social facts from books and catalogs, systematized through the Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation (UDC), an approved modiﬁcation of the Dewey Decimal Classiﬁcation that
included special symbols (Rayward 1997).The project was based on Otlet’s vision of a
“Universal Book,” an encyclopediac endeavor to supplement traditional libraries with a
free, global source of factual knowledge available to all.
A closely related endeavor also begun in 1895 was that of American zoologist Herbert
Field, who began the Concilium Bibliographicum in Zurich, Switzerland, with the goal
of providing scientists with coverage of the entire world’s output of zoological literature
in installments to be supplied every two weeks in the form of 75×125 mm catalog cards
using UDC notation (Burke and Buckland 2016). While the UDC still exists, neither of
these two projects long survived the death of their founder.
A third globally oriented scientiﬁc information and communication effort was that of
Nobel Prize-winning Latvian chemist, Wilhelm Ostwald, who used funds from his award
to found The Bridge, International Institute for the Organization of Intellectual Work in
1911, with the goal of making scientiﬁc communication more efﬁcient through the use of
Esperanto as a universal scientiﬁc language, through the centralization of speciﬁc ﬁelds
of science into global institutes that would oversee publication processes, and through
the standardization of scientiﬁc paper publication into a single “World Format.” The First
World War interrupted The Bridge’s activities, which were never re-established (Hapke
1999; Holt 1977).
Finally, a little-known attempt by two other Nobel Laureates to create an inclusive
“World Library” was that of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore and French novelist Romain
Rolland, who in 1923 proposed a global collection of the most important literary works
from both the East and West. Although some translation rights were obtained, the project
lacked substantial ﬁnancial support and was abandoned in the 1930s (Mani 2016). What
might perhaps be viewed as its successor is today’s Project Gutenberg, the freely available
online collection of works of world literature in the public domain, which was begun in
1971 by University of Illinois graduate student Michael Hart on the ARPANET computer
network, and which now includes the works of both Rolland and Tagore, as well as
thousands of other authors.
Billings, editor of the Index Medicus and an accomplished military physician in the US
Surgeon General’s Ofﬁce who masterminded what would eventually become the National
Library of Medicine, was keenly interested in vital statistics and worked closely with the
US Census Bureau. He is credited with suggesting to Bureau employee Herman Hollerith
the potential beneﬁts to the rapidly growing annual census of some type of mechani-
cal system to tabulate the census records. Hollerith, a gifted engineer familiar with the
automated jacquard looms whose silk fabrics were made through the use of designs con-
trolled by punch cards (Essinger 2004, pp. 160–161), followed up on this suggestion by

inventing his Hollerith Electric Tabulating System, which converted the data conveyed
by series of holes punched into special “Hollerith cards” into electrical impulses, which
would then activate mechanical counters. His system was successfully used for the 1890
census, leading Hollerith to start his Tabulating Machine Company, which was eventually
to become the foundation of the International Business Machines corporation. Tabulator
punch cards (31/4 by 73/8 inches or 82.550 by 187.325 mm) and library catalog cards
(71/2×121.2 cm size no. 33 catalog) were early perceived as being related: in the spring
of 1896, Hollerith and Melvil Dewey agreed on a three-year partnership under which
Dewey’s Library Bureau would supply standardized punch cards and cabinets to com-
mercial and government customers who used Hollerith’s tabulating equipment, just as it
supplied catalog cards and catalog cabinets to libraries, though this particular arrangement
lasted only three years (Wright 2014).
Such tabulators and cards became increasingly common: for instance, during the 1920s
the Copeland-Chatterson ﬁrm in London also began production of edge notched punch
cards, the so-called Cope-Chat cards, in their new Paramount Sorting System, which were
used for a wide variety of scientiﬁc and technological records. Kilgour (1997) describes a
number of successful indexing systems employing Cope-Chat cards. One form of punch
card system reﬁned by W.E. Batten of the Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain in 1944
involved the so-called “peek-a-boo” or optical coincidence: each Batten card was given
a subject heading from an approved list of terms and was marked off in tiny squares
with assigned numbers that corresponded to speciﬁc ﬁles. If the speciﬁc ﬁle related to
the subject heading, that square on the subject heading ﬁle was punched, indicating that
the collection contained items relevant to that heading. When multiple subject cards were
stacked together, those punched holes that penetrated throughout the entire stack identiﬁed
the items relevant to all the selected subjects, using Boolean AND logic (Kilgour 1997).
The efﬁciencies involved in such an inverted ﬁle system for specialized purposes were
obvious, serving as a precursor to today’s online ontologies, though its limitations in
terms of size and scope were obvious as well.
Efﬁciency like this was also central to British science ﬁction author H. G. Wells’s
(1938) book World Brain, which offered a monolithic notion of global informativeness, in
which a permanent world encyclopedia staffed by editors, abstractors, and indexers would
accumulate ﬁles from libraries, museums, universities, and other research organizations
around the world on an ongoing basis and serve as a “sort of mental clearing house for
the mind, a depot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested,
clariﬁed, compared” (Wells 1938, p. 69) as well as a centralized organization “for the
collection, indexing, summarizing and release of knowledge.” It would be “a synthesis
of bibliography and documentation with the indexed archives of the world” (Wells 1938,
p. 85) culminating in information products for worldwide distribution via microﬁlm, with
the ultimate goal of creating global consensus based on expert, scientiﬁc reasoning for
actions to be taken toward world progress. This initiative, largely adapted from Otlet’s
earlier UBR project, which had been largely abandoned by the time of Otlet’s death in

Cooperation and Competition
103
1940, never evolved in the more grandiose way that Wells envisioned, so the potential
problems inherent in his vision failed to materialize as well (Rayward 2008, p. 232).
Another widely read British book of the period, The Social Function of Science by the
controversial molecular biologist J. D. Bernal (1939), highlighted the contributions that
science could make to human well-being and also urged the importance of what would
eventually be known as current awareness, noting that for each scientiﬁc laboratory “there
should be someone deputed to watch the whole of current literature for items which might
be relevant to the work of the laboratory, and to be able to indicate without loss of time
where such items are likely to be found” (1939, p. 272). Bernal also played an active role
in the international scientiﬁc communications community, with such provocative propos-
als as abolishing scientiﬁc journals and making all scientiﬁc papers available to libraries
through a government-run distribution agency (Muddiman 2003).
Soon to become equally well known was another scientist, Vannevar Bush, ﬁrst head of
the National Science Foundation in the United States, whose article, “As We May Think”
(1945) in the popular magazine The Atlantic, imagined the “Memex” as a machine with
two adjacent desktop surfaces, where microﬁlm reels of documents, notes, and images
could be examined. It allowed users to link these within the machine’s archive by topic or
idea, so they could organize and retrieve ﬁles according to their personal indexing systems,
managing both the items and the connections they made among various items. Although
it was not published until 1945, Bush actually wrote this piece during the 1930s (Nyce
and Kahn 1989) so it can easily be considered in conjunction with the “World Brain”
vision of H. G. Wells, as both relied on the emerging technology of microﬁlm. Wells
focused on organizational inputs and Bush focused on individual outputs, but both can be
considered as elements in what might be considered a global information feedback loop.
Although Bush’s work has been widely appreciated as that of one of the early pioneers
of information science, his “associative trail” approach has been critiqued for its lack of
awareness of indexing and retrieval speciﬁcs and also for his own neglect of predecessors
such as Emmanuel Goldberg, who had actually invented a machine similar to the Memex
(Buckland 1992), but it should be noted also that the Memex also represents one of the
ﬁrst illustrations of “situational relevance,” essential from a user’s perspective.
Another book project with a scientiﬁc orientation was the International Encyclopedia
of Uniﬁed Science, headed by noted European scholars Otto Neurath and Rudolph Car-
nap, and the American linguist Charles W. Morris, a series widely discussed during the
1930s and 1940s. Among the last of the few volumes actually published in this encyclo-
pedic series was Thomas Kuhn’s On The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions (1962), which
became celebrated for its statement that working scientists generally had little use for
most previous scientiﬁc ﬁndings except those that directly impacted their own research, a
ﬁnding about the nature of scientiﬁc competition that was amply borne out by subsequent
research in the sociology of science (Hollinger 2011).
The lifting of various governmental restrictions on the dissemination of both US and
foreign technological and science information after the end of the Second World War

104

Progress, Public
(Vogel 2021) unleashed a ﬂood of technical and scientiﬁc reports that required new knowl-
edge organization and ﬁnding techniques beyond the traditional ones of library catalogs
and abstract journals (Cleverdon 1991). The Scientiﬁc Information Conference of the
Royal Society held in London in 1947 viewed indexing as one of the major problems in
scientiﬁc communication and duly noted four fundamental methods of subject indexing:
(1) indexing the names of subjects in alphabetical order, (2) classifying the subjects them-
selves under symbols which serve to pinpoint their positions in a logically constructed
map of knowledge, (3) coding the subjects under symbols which can be coded and then
stored in random order and run through a machine, when required, which automatically
picks out those of them which have been coded in any particular way, and (4) coding
the shapes of certain classes of objects which can then be retrieved by use of that code
(Holmstrom 1948, p. 284).
The use of the third technique, statistical in nature, would mark the beginning of a
change in era from traditional librarianship to what would become known as information
science. Also highly inﬂuential in this shift was the introduction of Shannon’s information
theory in 1948 and Cherry’s 1951 adaptation of it to communication theory (Pierce 1973).
The term “information retrieval” was coined by MIT researcher Calvin Mooers in 1950,
to denote the concept of selective rediscovery of information from some form of storage
(Mooers 1950) and also would become foundational to the ﬁeld.
Supporting Kuhn’s conclusions about the perceived value of contemporary competitive
scientiﬁc information, the volume of scientiﬁc and technological knowledge was rapidly
increasing and could even be quantiﬁed. Economist Fritz Machlup’s (1962) study, The
Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States, introduced the notion of
a “knowledge-based economy” and estimated that in 1959 almost 30% of the US’s gross
national product had been produced in knowledge industries. There was growing con-
sensus that this increase in scientiﬁc and technical information was of vital importance
to economic progress and that the improvement of information retrieval was essential to
maintaining that progress (Leslie 2020).
Central to this focus on information science was an increased emphasis on discovery
and novelty, especially in the growth of scientiﬁc and technical vocabularies for various
disciplines with highly speciﬁc terms and nomenclatures, as well as an increasing empha-
sis on identifying statistical patterns in these vocabularies and the resulting literatures.
The paradigmatic case is that of chemistry, which underwent rapid industrialization start-
ing in the 1860s, establishing the earliest research laboratories, dominating international
markets, and generating ﬁerce competition among not only ﬁrms but nations with the
development of new chemical compounds used for explosives, fertilizers, ﬁbers, fuels,
pharmaceuticals, poisons, synthetic rubbers, and other products used for both civilian and
military purposes (Lesch 2000).
The rapid growth in the chemical literature during the nineteenth century led to a recog-
nition of the critical need for comprehensive abstracting and indexing services for the
chemical sciences, especially as industrial chemicals were being weaponized (Schoﬁeld

1999). The American Chemical Society was founded in 1876, starting the Chemical
Abstracts Service in 1907, launching a journal devoted to chemical documentation in
1960, and adding the CAS Registry for small organic and inorganic molecules in 1965 to
provide access to substance information, eventually leading to the new ﬁeld of chemoin-
formatics (Lynch 1966). Several of the pioneers in information science had a background
in chemistry, such as Charles Bernier, Eugene Garﬁeld, and James Perry.
However, there were numerous debates during this post-war period sparked by the
variations in the bibliographic perspectives held by those working in archives and docu-
mentation centers, libraries, and special libraries, exempliﬁed by important publications
such as the 1945 founding of the Journal of Documentation and Bradford’s (1948) text-
book Documentation in England, Briet’s (1951) pamphlet Qu’est-cequeladocumentation?
in France, and the 1950 founding of the journal American Documentation and Egan and
Shera’s (1952) article “Foundations of a theory of bibliography” in the United States.
Robertson (2008, p. 439) explains that “the core of the argument was generally not
empirical, but philosophical. Library classiﬁcation schemes tend to carry with them entire
philosophical world-views, concerning the nature of human knowledge, and to some
extent of its representation in documents. But the nature of language as such was some-
what separate and peripheral – in some sense the object of a formal classiﬁcation or
indexing system is to avoid all the vagaries and pitfalls of natural language. Of course
one has to describe and deﬁne the concepts or categories of the scheme in natural lan-
guage, but the function of this description might be regarded as pedagogic – to help the
librarian or user towards an understanding of what the concept or category really is, and to
see underneath the surface of language. In constructing such a scheme, one might appeal
to literary warrant, but that would not absolve one of the responsibility of understanding
the concept. In the context of these arguments, empiricism (let alone a formal scientiﬁc
experiment) was a radical notion. There was resistance to a strictly functional view of
such schemes, quite apart from the difﬁculties of ﬁrst formulating the functionality and
then operationalizing an experimental framework.”
An anonymous editorial in the April 1955 American Documentation enthused over the
possibilities offered by these new forms of experimentation: “classiﬁcation unencumbered
by the arbitrary delineation of knowledge into rigid compartmentation is now possible
through the use of automatic, or semi-automatic mechanisms – machines which give to
classiﬁcation a new ﬂexibility and elasticity through the ease with which entirely new cat-
egories, classes, or composite groupings may be generated whenever a particular situation
or need so demands. Selection based on combinations, any combinations, of characteris-
tic attributes is a fundamental property of documentation systems utilizing automatic or
semi-automatic mechanisms (mechanical aids). Thus with properly designed equipment
the full range of combinations permitted by the logical theory of class deﬁnitions becomes
possible in making selections.”
Jesse Shera, dean of the library school at Western Reserve University in Cleveland,
established the Center for Documentation and Communication Research in 1955, the

106
7
Progress, Public
ﬁrst computerized research center associated with a library school, which was headed
by information scientists Allen Kent and James Perry. The center’s legacy to LIS (in
particular, furthering development of the terms recall and precision in the evaluation of
library information retrieval) has been widely acknowledged. Perry (Ranganathan and
Perry 1951), Kent (1959), and Shera (1961) were all proliﬁc contributors to the emer-
gent literature of information science which, as key theoretical insights resulting from
empirical developments in information retrieval, growing interest in symbolic logic, and
emerging applications to knowledge organization, would transform the ﬁeld within the
next 50 years. The next chapter will describe this transformation, as library discovery sys-
tems and more general information discovery systems, notably the Internet, even though
retaining many commonalities, became increasingly differentiated in their uses.

Discovery, Retrieval
Abstract
This chapter describes the emergence of the differentiation between traditional librari-
anship with its focus on collections, which has become incorporated into today’s library
discovery systems, and information science with its focus on retrieval, which has
become incorporated into algorithms and ontologies for today’s global Internet, which
together comprise the contemporary discipline of library and information science.
Keywords are integral to library and information science. Saracevic (2008) identiﬁed
the emphasis on search and relevance as a deﬁning characteristic of the emerging ﬁeld,
with its focus on information retrieval. Search processes and relevance to users, mostly
implicit within the traditional reference functions that promoted and supported the use
of library collections, were to become explicit in the new information retrieval functions,
most of which involved utilizing the statistical and semantic characteristics of individual
words. While the study of so-called “indexing languages” (that is, the controlled vocabu-
lary and formalized structure used to organize materials) was also becoming much more
sophisticated (Coates 1970; Soergel 1974) and eventually resulted in today’s conceptual
theories of knowledge organization (Machado et al. 2019), both LIS endeavors contin-
ued on diverging and occasionally converging paths: one toward today’s library discovery
systems and the other toward search algorithms and ontologies for the global Internet.

library subject catalog) and post-correlative (that is, a searcher’s subsequent correlation of
multiple individual terms to locate an individual document) indexing became more marked
with the development of new technologies intended to automate indexing (Kilgour 1997).
It should be noted that even computerized information retrieval systems normally required
an intermediary, such as a librarian or online specialist, to assist the user during the ﬁrst
few decades of their existence.
The current ANSI/NISO Standard Z39.4-2021 Criteria for Indexes (2021) differentiates
types of indexes by (1) periodicity (one-time, closed indexes; continuing, open indexes);
(2) method of document analysis (human intellectual analysis to identify topics and con-
cepts; computer algorithms to identify useful terms, phrases, or features; combination
of algorithmic and human analysis); (3) type or extent of indexable matter (full text of
documents; abstracts; titles only; ﬁrst lines only); (4) arrangement of entries (designed
for human scanning, including alphabetical or alphanumeric; classiﬁed by relationships
among concepts; based on enumerative or faceted classiﬁcation schemes; alphabetico-
classed: broad headings arranged alphabetically; narrower headings are grouped under
broad headings and arranged alphanumerically or relationally based on hierarchy, inclu-
sion, chronology, or other association; not designed for human scanning); and (5) type of
entries (titles of documents; creators and contributors; subjects including topics or fea-
tures such as genres, format, methodological approach; identiﬁers such as numbers that
can be used to locate documents; physical descriptions such as terms that describe the
type of content, and other types of single entry–type indexes, including place name, com-
pany name, law, case name, medication, and industrial classiﬁcation codes). Importantly,
all of these index types are found both in library and in general informational settings.

Library Discovery Systems
Today’s library discovery systems can trace their history through the ﬁrst computerized
circulation systems in the early 1960s, followed by applications to library acquisitions,
serials control, and cataloging (Kilgour 1970). The development of the MARC (Machine
Readable Cataloging) standard for bibliographic information allowed the distribution of
the Library of Congress’s cataloging data through magnetic tape to participating libraries
in 1969. Cooperative cataloging using computerized networks such as the Ohio College
Library Center (now known as OCLC), which was started in 1970, and the Research
Libraries Information Network, which was started in 1974, remain among the best known
of the various cataloging consortia.
Also essential to the evolution from library catalog to library discovery were the multi-
ple changes in library cataloging standards, starting with the Anglo-American Cataloging
Rules (AACR), ﬁrst published in 1967 and going through several editions until 2005,
when it was abandoned in favor of a new model to be based on the 1998 Functional

Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) created by the International Federation
of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), which was developed into the Resource
Description and Access (RDA) framework in 2010, considered to be much more adapted
to use in contemporary digital environments. The Library of Congress began work in
2011 toward updating its original MARC format into its new Bibliographic Framework
(BIBFRAME) format for similar reasons (Kalita and Deka 2021).
Individual access to computerized library systems gradually began to be made avail-
able to academic and public library users, with the Ohio State University Libraries’ Open
Public Access Catalog (OPAC) being the ﬁrst in 1975. This OPAC was launched as an
outgrowth of its computerized circulation system (Su 1994, p. 136) and introduced a sub-
ject search capability in 1978. Within a few years, OPACs were being widely incorporated
into the so-called integrated library systems (ILS), which were initially designed by indi-
vidual libraries and later offered as turnkey systems by vendors, many of whom were the
database providers as well. These developments are often referred to as ﬁrst-generation,
usually replicating the information from physical catalog cards, second-generation, often
offering adjacency, proximity, wild card, and keyword searching, as well as Boolean logic,
while third-generation OPACs offered graphical user interfaces and the ability to query
on language, publication date, and other speciﬁcations (Wells 2021).
In the 1990s, library systems began to incorporate link resolvers to connect between
their catalog records and external database content, as full text became increasingly avail-
able, and to add federated search capabilities for searching simultaneously across multiple
external databases. By the 2000s, library search had begun to be inﬂuenced by the exam-
ple of web browsers (Peters and Bell 2006; Schneider 2006a, b, c), ﬁrst with the creation
of the so-called “next-generation catalogs” and then by “discovery layers” which were
separated from the library’s own ILS in order to be compatible with any vendor database,
especially those with full journal contents. The term “discovery system” began to be used
by 2010 in order to emphasize the move from internal library holdings to the discovery of
multiple external resources. Another major change was the wide-spread implementation
of “one-box” searching to emphasize the similarity to general-purpose search engines
like Google and the incorporation of non-transparent relevance algorithms and faceted
browsing (Wells 2021).
While these systems became increasingly popular with users, much of the LIS research
on academic libraries continues to focus on the inability of these users to understand the
use of Boolean logic, to identify relevant keywords, to employ suitable search strategies
for subject headings, or even to devote sufﬁcient time to scanning results (Cribbs and
Gardner 2022), although over time these research efforts have also expanded into much
broader investigations of information literacy (Hicks et al. 2022).

Information Discovery Systems
Book indexing had always focused on individual words within speciﬁc content rather than
on subject headings or other forms of library classiﬁcation, but individual words were
now also perceived as key entry points to larger, specialized forms of discourse such as
science. Quantitative linguistics (Reed 1949) and speciﬁcally, the work of Harvard linguist
George Kingsley Zipf (1945) on word frequency, with the most common words (the, and,
a) showing distinctive differences from less common words drew particular attention, as
the statistical pattern Zipf described seemed related to a similar distribution identiﬁed by
Bradford (1948, pp. 106–121) showing the productivity of scientiﬁc journals in publishing
in areas of specialized research, in which the scientiﬁc publications of most impact in
any particular ﬁeld comprised a very small subset of all the journals with occasional
articles about that ﬁeld, a distribution which Vickery (1948) also found approximated to
the publications that scientists he surveyed in particular research areas actually read. It
was soon realized that application of statistical regularities within document terminology,
especially in conjunction with the advances in mechanized searching, might increase the
efﬁciency of the document discovery process (Brookes 1968).
Although the study of scientiﬁc terminology was in its infancy, Kent wrote, “To take
a word as having a precise meaning kills it as an instrument of scientiﬁc progress. The
great scientists have recognized this in their practice, if not always in what they have
said about their practice. Words don’t ﬁle things into pigeon holes, to stay there, but are
creative. Words help create, among other things, new and better meanings for themselves.
If science is viewed statically, words seem to be precise labels. But if science is viewed
dynamically, as the moving thing it actually is, words are imprecise but constantly improv-
ing tools” (1958, p. 186). Scientiﬁc terms are constantly evolving through such processes
as semantic change, morphophonemic change, functional change, compositional change,
neologizing, and borrowing (Caso 1980), increasing their rarity in comparison with more
common words and their signiﬁcance thus becoming easier to identify.
While the meanings of scientiﬁc terms were being debated by philosophers of science
(Achinstein 1964) especially in reference to their “indeterminacy” (that is, how their inter-
pretation might be impacted over time by shifts in associated concepts and theories),
contemporary discussions of scientiﬁc terms by information scientists focused primarily
on their role as document surrogates in indexing systems, viewing ambiguities as “se-
mantic noise” and seeking quantitative approaches to resolve these (Tinker 1966). This
was presumably because of the pragmatic nature of information organization and retrieval
work, in which “indeterminacy” between term selection by indexer and searcher is viewed
as more important than “indeterminacy” in the terms themselves (Blair 1986).
IBM engineer Hans-Peter Luhn observed (1957) that the statistical structures of dif-
ferent categories of information affected their ease of retrieval. For instance, “ready
reference” systems such as dictionaries and parts catalogs were easiest, followed by
narrowly deﬁned and repetitive systems of ﬁxed categories such as personnel lists and

8.3

medical case histories, followed by inventories of uniquely deﬁnable structures such as
those found in chemistry, followed by highly disciplined intellectual systems such as those
found in law, logic, and mathematics, followed by evolving systems involving phenom-
ena and objects in applied sciences and technology, followed by more loosely associated
systems dealing with various concepts in the human sciences and the humanities.
Another way in which the nascent information science ﬁeld distinguished itself from
traditional forms of librarianship was by emphasizing its commercial aspects for busi-
ness and government information and by employing terms such as “coding” rather than
“indexing” and “classiﬁcation” rather than “cataloging.” Calvin Mooers, who had orig-
inated the phrase “information retrieval,” also founded the ﬁrst commercial information
retrieval company, the Zator Company, shortly thereafter. His “Zator” system for infor-
mation retrieval was based on superimposed codes (Zatocoding) on marginal punched
cards (Mooers 1951). He envisioned his zatocoding technique as part of a more sophisti-
cated information retrieval machine, the DOKEN (Document Engine), which he claimed
“would be able to search the entire Library of Congress in ten seconds, select all the
information on a given subject and print selected abstracts at the rate of ten a minute”
(Mooers 1950), but this highly conceptual invention was never implemented (Aitchison
and Cleverdon 1963).
Mooers was also dismissive of existing inventions such as the “Rapid Selector” ini-
tially developed under Vannevar Bush’s auspices at MIT and subsequently implemented
by Ralph Shaw at the US Department of Agriculture’s library in 1949. The Rapid Selec-
tor used 35-mm ﬁlm, on each reel of which were stored the contents of almost 500,000
conventional library cards, each of which also had a pre-determined code pattern, consist-
ing of black and white squares, indicating the subject. A master card could be inserted
into the machine to select all the cards for a desired subject. The Selector was capable
of being coded for 10 million subjects, but Shaw discovered that even in a fairly struc-
tured ﬁeld such as agriculture, the lack of an adequate indexing system made the Selector
impractical for regular use and it was abandoned by 1952 (Varlejs et al. 1999).
In his analysis of conceptual articles appearing in the journal American Documenta-
tion during the 1950s and 1960s, Smiraglia (2014) identiﬁed the most prevalent concepts
among these: unsurprisingly, “indexing” appeared frequently as the practical aspect of
document representation. These included coordinate indexing (Taube et al. 1952), con-
textual indexing (Luhn 1960) citation indexing (Garﬁeld and Sher 1963), and associative
indexing (Doyle 1962).
Coordinate indexing was popularized by Mortimer Taube (1961), whose Uniterm sys-
tem was ﬁrst used for searching the massive collection of documents at the U.S. Armed
Services Technical Information Agency. Although certainly not the ﬁrst to use a selection
of individual terms for retrieval, a technique previously well-known as “pre-correlative
indexing” (Bernier 1956), Taube was arguably the ﬁrst to unify and codify the process of
both indexing and retrieving speciﬁc terms, calling his approach “coordinate indexing,”

116
8
Discovery, Retrieval
branding his terms as “Uniterms” and commercializing his projects under the corpo-
rate name “Documentation, Inc.” His system assigned single words or simple phrases
(Uniterms) representing individual concepts found within a particular document as “key
words.” The selection of a particular Uniterm would then retrieve the accession num-
bers of all documents indexed by that Uniterm. Advantages of the system were seen as
the depth of information possible from the use of multiple Uniterms and the speed of
retrieval through use of an inverted indexing system. Disadvantages were seen as loss
of information through problems such as multiple word meanings or synonyms, false
retrievals, difﬁculties in generic or speciﬁc description through the sole use of Uniterms,
and lack of a thesaurus to guide the assignment of Uniterms (Costello 1961). To auto-
mate the search process, Taube also developed the IBM 9900 Special Index Analyzer or
COMAC (Continuous Multiple Access Collator), a punched card collator that tracked
logical relationships among subject terms, and which used the IBM 305 RAMAC to print
out the results.
Comparative testing to determine the relative efﬁcacy of various indexing and retrieval
systems was also triggered by the availability of Taube’s system. The ﬁrst known test
was an experiment in using Taube’s Uniterm system to index 15,000 documents on aero-
nautics in the Armed Services Technical Information Agency’s collection, which were
also indexed using an existing subject heading system there. Test queries were submitted
to both indexing systems, but the experts judging the results were unable to agree on
whether numerous retrieved documents were relevant to the search, so further testing was
cancelled due to the lack of consensus (Gull 1956).
A second and better known set of tests using the Taube Uniterm system were the Cran-
ﬁeld tests, which pioneered the use of test collections in order to objectively determine
relative success in precision and recall by various indexing systems (Voorhees 2001). The
ﬁrst effort (Cranﬁeld 1) employed a test collection of 18,000 papers in the ﬁeld of aeronau-
tical engineering, which were indexed separately with the use of Taube’s Uniterm system,
the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation, an alphabetical subject catalog, and a facet classiﬁ-
cation. Evaluation with 1,200 different queries with the goal of identifying known source
documents found that the Uniterm approach of selecting key words from the document
appeared to be equally successful in ﬁnding relevant documents as the more traditional
methods (Cleverdon 1960). A second experiment, using the metallurgical literature indices
compiled at Cranﬁeld and at Western Reserve University, indicated that the more exhaus-
tive indexing system at WRU performed no better in terms of retrieval than did the simpler
Cranﬁeld system (Aitchison and Cleverdon, 1963), leading WRU’s Allan Kent to observe
later that the real value of this particular test was that it was the ﬁrst in which the inverse
relationship of recall and precision was experimentally demonstrated (Kent 1987). A third
experiment using 221 queries on a test collection of 1,400 documents on high speed aero-
dynamics and aircraft structures which had been indexed with a facet classiﬁcation system
found again that the use of single terms produced the most relevant results (Cleverdon

8.3

117
et al. 1966). There was considerable criticism about the conclusions drawn from the Cran-
ﬁeld tests, arguing that these were too sweeping based on the actual evidence (Swanson
1965; Taube 1965), and that other important factors were ignored (Coates 1976). The
use of test collections instituted by the Cranﬁeld tests, however, became a hallmark of
information retrieval research.
Contextual or KWIC (Keyword-in Context) indexing was pioneered by Hans-Peter
Luhn’s development of a way to automate the process of manual indexing of literature
by scanning the titles of documents, eliminating common (“stop”) words, and placing
the remaining “content” or “key” words in a ﬁxed position for quick identiﬁcation, with
a ﬁxed number of letters on either side of the keywords in order to establish “context”
(Luhn 1960). This rough approximation of topicality relied on document authors’ sup-
plying the most pertinent words in their titles, but Luhn’s automatic document indexing
program also used a document’s word frequency and distribution to compute a “measure
of signiﬁcance” for both words and sentences, which then formed the “auto-abstract” of
the most signiﬁcant sentences in the document (Luhn 1958b).
He also prototyped a novel selector using punch cards, light, and photocells, with a
search speed of 600 cards per minute in 1951, but this was quickly made obsolete by his
next prototype, which used punch cards with an IBM mainframe computer (Burton 1981).
Luhn’s work continually stressed the commercial importance of information retrieval in
business intelligence (Luhn 1958a), especially the business value of a quick machine-
generated “dissemination” index of recent publications in a particular ﬁeld as opposed to
the more traditional “retrieval” index of all publications in that ﬁeld (Bernard 2019). One
of the ﬁrst U.S. government agencies to employ Luhn’s selector system during the 1950s
was the Central Intelligence Agency (Drell 1957).
Both Luhn’s KWIC system and a similar one invented separately by Herbert Ohlman of
the Systems Development Corporation with a system called “permutation indexing” also
using IBM equipment were introduced at the 1958 International Conference on Scientiﬁc
Information (ICSI) in Washington, DC. The KWIC product, however, quickly achieved
wider distribution under IBM’s sponsorship, especially after its adoption by the American
Chemical Society (Williams 2010). Variations on Luhn’s KWIC concept followed, such
as Jordan’s Keyword-Out-of-Context indexing method, which entailed a non-permutated
keyword index, in which each alphabetized block of relevant keywords preceded a block
of those associated titles to the right (Jordan and Watkins 1968), the Key-Letter-in-Context
method, which involves a lexicographic ordering of all terms in a data base by each char-
acter (alpha, numeric or special) in the term or character string, a permuted arrangement
sorted by character with the balance of the term wrapped around it and is used to identify
letter combinations that are highly speciﬁc and would therefore be discriminating search
terms (Williams 1972), and the double-KWIC system, in which the ﬁrst signiﬁcant word
in a title is extracted as the main index term and replaced by an asterisk to indicate its
position in the title, while the remaining words in the title are then rotated, permitting each

118

Discovery, Retrieval
signiﬁcant word to appear as the ﬁrst word of a wrap-around subordinate entry under the
main index term (Petrarca and Lay 1969).
Beginning in 1949, IBM selectors were also being used for literary concordances:
the best known of which was Catholic priest Roberto Busa’s project to develop con-
cordances to the massive body of work of Thomas Aquinas (Arun 2021; Rockwell and
Sinclair 2020). By 1958, however, IBM provided access to its IBM 705, an electronic
computer, for Busa’s concordance to the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly facilitated Busa’s
concordance programs (Tasman 1957). IBM computers were also used for Josephine
Miles’s 1957 concordance to John Dryden’s poetry (Buurma and Hefferman 2018) and
Stephen Parrish’s 1959 concordance to the poetry of Matthew Arnold (Parrish 1962).
These projects represent the earliest beginnings of today’s digital humanities, in that they
allowed scholars much easier access than the many manually compiled and printed con-
cordances that followed Cruden’s 1749 biblical concordance for work in textual research,
linguistic analysis, and philological comparisons.
Citation indexing, originally developed by chemist Eugene Garﬁeld during the 1950s
for chemical literature, quickly expanded into other scientiﬁc disciplines through his
Science Citation Index, which collected all the references found in articles published in
speciﬁc scientiﬁc journals and continuously compiled and published an index providing
bibliographic information about each reference and listing all subsequent articles which
cited these (Garﬁeld 1957). Citation indexing offered an alternative approach to search, as
each listed reference is presumably relevant to the citing paper and therefore potentially
relevant to the reader as well, similar to the process used in searching legal precedents in
decided cases (“shepardizing”), as it was dubbed by lawyers searching Shepard’s Citation
Service in preparation for current cases. Scientists following the work of other labora-
tories often found Garﬁeld’s index invaluable because it only required looking up the
names of scientists whose work was of particular interest. The Science Citation Index
was also foundational to the emerging ﬁeld of bibliometrics as it provided an accessible
method of statistical analysis and network mapping through the connections that could be
seen through the analysis of authors, co-authors, documents, institutions, keywords, and
subsequent citations (De Bellis 2009).
“Associative indexing” encompassed several different methods, all referring to the
identiﬁcation of those words whose frequency, proximity, or synonymy made them likely
candidates for retrieval, and whose probable relevance to a particular topic or query could
thus be evaluated. Guiliano (1965) described three ways of describing a body of natural
language text and the three ways to view association measures computed with respect
to that body as: (1) a text as a closed formal system which represents only itself, in in
which case the computed association measures are descriptive rather than predictive statis-
tics; (2) a body of text representing a much larger corpus of text, in which case some
descriptive statistics for that sample will be predictive of patterns likely to be present
in the larger population; and (3) a text as a representation of the encoding of concepts

8.3
Information Discovery Systems
119
and of conceptual relationships important to some area of discourse, in which case com-
puted associations are correlates of actual relationships which exist among the concepts
expressed by language. Guiliano further proposed that the practical utility of computed
associations is dependent upon the third kind of interpretation, and that it is possible to
obtain at least two types of measurements from text which are under certain conditions
interpretable as applying to relationships among the designata of words, namely associa-
tion through contiguity or synonymy, based upon counting procedures applied to words
and word pairs found within text.
One highly inﬂuential model proposed by Maron and Kuhns (1960) differentiated
between the semantical (grounded in the meaning of a particular term) and statistical
(grounded in the frequency of a particular term as relative to other terms) aspects of
words, ignoring any linguistic interpretation of the association measures of terms and
focusing on the entirely statistical analysis of the co-occurrence of terms in the “index
space” to provide an initial relevance ranking for the user. The goal was to assign a prob-
ability to the likelihood of a match between the description of a particular document and
the description of a particular user query.
Stiles (1961) operationalized this model at the U.S. Department of Defense by using
term association mapping in conjunction with Taube’s Uniterm system. This approach
involved the preparation of a proﬁle for each request term, consisting of terms that had
been used with the request term that have an association factor greater than 1; the compar-
ison of these proﬁles and the identiﬁcation of the so-called “ﬁrst-generation terms,” those
terms which appear in all or in a given number of proﬁles; the use of these ﬁrst gener-
ation terms as request terms, repeating the ﬁrst and second steps above to identify the
so-called “second generation terms”; the compilation of a table of association factors for
the expanded list of request terms, with the sum of the association factors for each term
being called its “wezgM,” a weight which indicates the degree of association between
that term and the complete request; a comparison of the list of expanded request terms
with the index terms of each document in the collection and the addition of the weights
(wezgM) of the terms that matched, with the sum of the weights (wezgMs) being called
the “document relevance number”; and, ﬁnally, the document relevance number being
used to present the documents to the requester in the order of their probable relevance to
the request.
A second probabilistic approach was developed by Sparck-Jones (1972) who exper-
imented with statistically determining the effects both of exhaustivity (the number of
terms used to index an individual document) and speciﬁcity (the number of documents
to which an individual term pertains) on retrieval. Her work introduced the idea that the
frequency of occurrence of a word in a document collection was inversely proportional
to its signiﬁcance in retrieval: less common words tended to refer to more speciﬁc con-
cepts, which were more important in retrieval. A second experiment involved weighting
the terms by a Zipﬁan term distribution curve for the entire document collection, ﬁnding
that retrieval performance was signiﬁcantly improved by using this collection frequency

120

measure. Sparck-Jones and Robertson (1976) expanded on this by developing a relevance-
weighting model in which a random set of relevant documents is used to estimate the
probability that any relevant document would have a particular property, or a combination
of properties.
Salton and Yang compared the collection frequency measure, which they called “in-
verse document frequency” or IDF, with the document term frequency weighting method
and with their own term discrimination measure. They compared the removal of terms
with high document frequency (IDF) to the removal of terms weights, multiplied by the
existing document term frequency, ﬁnding that retrieval performance was most improved
by using the second method, producing the now famous tf*idf (term frequency * inverse
document frequency) weighting.
During this period, Salton also introduced the earliest version of what was to become
his Vector Space Model, a mathematical alternative to Taube’s Boolean and Maron’s prob-
abilistic models. He employed matrix and vector notations to present the frequencies of
extracted words (the term-document “incidence” matrix) using the vector representation
to describe similarities computed using both extracted words and citation data, and rec-
ommended the cosine of angles between vectors as a measure of association (Salton 1963,
1973) as well as the pilot of his SMART system for evaluating the results of various forms
of associative indexing (Salton 1965). One of the best known of his SMART test results,
involving the National Library of Medicine’s prestigious MEDLARS system, a leading
exemplar of manual indexing in the critical ﬁeld of medical research, was that machine
indexing produced comparable results to expert, extensive indexing, at substantially less
cost in money and time (Salton 1972).
Another useful technique that improved retrieval was stemming, the process of match-
ing words to their lexical variants. The Lovins stemmer was introduced in 1968 (Lovins
1968) and was eventually improved upon by its better-known successor, the Porter stem-
mer (Porter 1980), which signiﬁcantly reduced the complexity of the rules for sufﬁx
removal and applied a single, uniﬁed approach to the handling of context.
Probability-oriented approaches to information retrieval became increasingly popular
during the 1970s. Robertson (1977) deﬁned the so-called probability ranking principle,
which determined how to optimally rank documents based on probabilistic measures with
respect to pre-deﬁned evaluation measures. This approach was reﬁned by Van Rijsbergen
(1977) with the incorporation of term dependency into ranked retrieval, and this line
of research eventually resulted in a family of scoring functions with slightly different
components and parameters. Most impactful was the ranking function BM25, a bag-of-
words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing
in each document, regardless of their proximity within the document.
Advances were also made in the 1980s on Salton’s basic Vector Space model, the
best known of which is latent semantic indexing (LSI), where the dimensionality of the
vector space of a document collection was reduced through the use of singular value
decomposition, a mathematical technique that can be used to identify patterns in the

relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of
text (Deerwester et al. 1990).
Network representations also became important in information retrieval during the
1980s for uses in browsing (Thompson and Croft, 1989), document clustering (Croft
1980), spreading activation search (Cohen and Kjeldsen 1987), support for multiple search
strategies (Croft and Thompson 1987), the representation of user knowledge (Oddy et al.
1986), and document content (Tong and Shapiro 1985). These advances, particularly the
invention of vector representation for semantic models, which deﬁne a word as a sequence
of numbers that indicate how often it appears near other words, providing a nearly unlim-
ited space of interconnected meanings in which concepts and topics may cluster, along
with the staggering increase in available computer power, would shortly transform textual
information search capabilities almost beyond recognition.
8.4
The TREC Conferences
Starting in 1990, the U.S. National Institute of Standards &Technology and the U.S.
Department of Defense sponsored the TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) series of work-
shops (Voorhees and Harman, 2005) designed to provide larger test collections than those
previously available in order to evaluate how various ranking and weighting approaches
were impacted by collection composition and size. Earlier ranking functions were created
through experimentation and manually tuned; however, the growing availability of train-
ing data based on all queries of a particular collection began to produce superior results
(Fuhr 1986, 1989). One important ﬁnding was that the automatic construction of queries
based on natural language query statements appeared to produce results equivalent to
those based on vector or probabilistic approaches. TREC workshops have grown in the
number of research groups and research tracks, focusing in various years on such topics
as COVID 19 information and misinformation, cross-language retrieval, crowdsourcing,
genomic data, legal documents, news stories, medical informatics, patents, patient medi-
cal records, social media, and video streams. Evaluation also remained a constant topic in
information retrieval through the present, with a variety of new considerations emerging,
such as that of fairness (Gao and Shah 2022).
Importantly, the TREC workshops themselves are non-commercial in nature, so specif-
ically marketing-oriented search engine research is not conducted there, though TREC
algorithms and applications often migrate into the commercial search sector, which is the
topic of the next chapter.

Databases, Search Engines
Abstract
This chapter describes the history of commercial databases, the rise of search engines,
and the range in responses of libraries and LIS researchers to these developments
during the past 50 years.
Clearly, the connections between libraries and commercial information suppliers can be
dated to far before Gutenberg’s print workshop in Germany in 1440, as woodblock print-
ers in Japan were producing thousands of copies of Buddhist sutras for public distribution
as early as 770, but it is only recently that many of these relationships have evolved into
what might well be described as antagonistic, as “information” has become an increas-
ingly precious resource to some, such as academic libraries, and an increasingly valuable
commodity to others, such as global information analytics corporations.
9.1
Commercial Databases
As mentioned in Chap. 8, libraries became accustomed to commercial database searches
as these ﬁrst emerged during the 1960s, with systems such as Lockheed’s Dialog, initially
developed under contract with NASA, and Systems Development Corporation’s ORBIT,
initially developed under contract as ELHILL with the National Library of Medicine.
These systems began as subscription-based dial-up services through time-sharing main-
frames in order to access speciﬁc bibliographic databases and initially required specially
trained search intermediaries familiar with the products in order to run searches for
users. Dialog provided specialized inverted and linear indexes for Boolean and proximity
searches, which could be reﬁned on an iterative basis. ORBIT also used inverted ﬁles and
did proximity and truncation searching, but was limited by its nonrecursive, non-Boolean

searching (Bourne 1980). Lexis, a legal information search service introduced in 1972 by
the Mead Data Corporation, was the ﬁrst commercial search system available directly to
its users in law ofﬁces and is now LexisNexis, acquired in 1994 by Reed Elsevier, now
RELX. After undergoing several changes in ownership, Dialog was bought in 2021 by
Clarivate Analytics, which now also owns what was originally the Science Citation Index.
Similarly, Orbit, after several changes in ownership, was bought in 1994 by Questel, an
online company based in France, and became Questel-Orbit.
In general, there has been a reduction in the number of commercial database search
ﬁrms over the years, due in part to multiple acquisitions and mergers and due in part to
the inﬂuence of the Internet and the growth of general-purpose search engines. However,
ﬁrms such as Clarivate Analytics and RELX continue to enjoy a dominant position in the
scholarly publishing ecosystem, as they publish many of the leading academic journals
and provide powerful analytic data based on these.
9.2
Search Engines
Although the ﬁrst use of the term “search engine” according to the Oxford English Dictio-
nary seems to be found in an April 10, 1978 article in the computer industry publication,
Computerworld (“Primary keys will handle production problems related to data while sec-
ondary keys called ‘search engines’ will speed the location of ﬁles within data bases”), it
did not come into common usage until the 1990s, when the development of the Internet
as a global network of networks marked another transformation of the library and infor-
mation science environment, impacting it much more than did previous ﬁnancial support
provided by various U.S. government agencies in information research areas of national
importance.
While much of the early development of its predecessor, the ARPANET, was done
under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Defense, since the goal of a robust and
resilient system with multiple nodes that would be less vulnerable to attack entailed basic
research in advanced technology rather than the command-and-control systems then in use
by the U.S. military, the research community involved often had academic ties (Abbate,
1999). Even though the ARPANET is universally recognized as the predecessor of the
Internet, Campbell-Kelly and Garcia-Swartz (2013) correctly point out that, without the
multiple commercial and international efforts that built the personal and institutional com-
puting environments, the TCP/IP protocols that became the Internet’s foundation would
have had little of general interest to connect.
The evolution of the Internet through its various protocols has always included some
element of search, whether simply through the GREP (Global Regular Expression Print)
command line used for searching and matching text ﬁles on the UNIX computers that
made up the majority of early Internet servers (Rualthanzauva 2014), through sockets
identiﬁcation for host-host protocols (Fidler and Acker 2014) through the Wide Area

Search Engines

Information System for client systems on the TC/ICP protocol which allowed users to
search for and retrieve documents whose text contained speciﬁed words; through the
Archie system which let users utilize GREP to search a list of public anonymous FTP
sites using the Telnet protocol, through the Veronica and Jughead systems for the Gopher
protocol which let users select topics from hierarchically organized menus from informa-
tion providers instead of having to know and type in the names of computers and ﬁles,
through webcrawlers for the HTTP protocol (McMurdo 1995), which allowed web pages
to be indexed, through WHOIS to search for registrations on the Domain Name System
for the TCP/IP protocol (Bradshaw and DeNardis 2019), through the hashtag identiﬁer
# which originated on Internet Relay Chat to search for group topics but which subse-
quently attained much greater visibility on Twitter (Pandell 2017), or through the Ahmia
search engine for the TOR protocol, which allows users to access the so-called “dark
web” (Gehl 2018).
A major change was the hypertextual development of the World Wide Web in 1994
with the creation of the HTTP protocol, its associated mark-up language (HTML) with
its anchor tag coding for hyperlinks, and its uniform resource locator (URL) to denote
webpage locations. Hypertext at its simplest is the ability to create documents which link
to one another, and it sparked the ensuing explosion of “content” beyond what had been
previously available through distribution by libraries and print publishers. Web pages pro-
liferated, providing an extraordinary variety of material from both authoritative sources
and others. The development and distribution of the free Web browsers Mosaic and
Netscape eased navigation between web pages but didn’t assist directly in the search pro-
cess, giving rise to web page “lists of links” to popular resources. A more technologically
sophisticated solution was the invention of robot crawlers to gather and compile informa-
tion from individual web pages. Web crawlers developed selection policies to determine
which pages to download, revisit policies to indicate when to check for changes, polite-
ness policies to avoid overloading sites by too frequent visits, and parallelization policies
to coordinate distributed crawling (Pinkerton 2000).
Early search engine structure included a crawler module, a page repository, an index-
ing module, indexes, a query module, and a ranking module (Langville and Meyer 2011).
They used inverted indexes that encoded term frequencies, term positions, document struc-
ture information, and document metadata that let users query the system with keywords,
key phrases, and other advanced search operators. Other index-related innovations were
the use of anchor text on web pages for keyword matching and hyperlink connection anal-
ysis, which were considerably more complex in the web environment, given the diversity
of textual context and users, the rapid growth of the web, and the possibilities of deliberate
intervention and manipulation.
According to Reider (2020), the novel ranking strategies HITS (Hypertext Induced
Topic Search) by Kleinberg (1999) and PageRank by Brin and Page (1998) revolutionized
search engine conceptualization by complementing the traditional notion of a document
repository as a ﬂat corpus in which relevance is only determined by a speciﬁc information

need with the more sociometrically inﬂuenced ideas of status, authority, and inﬂuence.
This change conceptualized the web corpus as a graph network of documents linked by
various attributes. Kleinberg’s HITS model retrieved documents matching a speciﬁc query
and then utilized eigenvector-based evaluative metrics (“hubness” and “authoritativeness”)
of the links to these found pages to rank them in order of their presumed importance
within the domain of the result set rather than of the entire web corpus.
Brin and Page’s PageRank model instead conceived the hyperlink network between
web pages in terms of a rational attribution of their relative importance by document
authors, similar to the concept of scholarly citations, becoming “a singular, univer-
sal network of ‘authority’ that the search system can combine with traditional ranking
mechanisms to calculate a ﬁnal score during the search process” (Reider 2020, p. 286).
Both algorithms represented slightly different approaches to algorithmic evaluation of
Internet content, but it was soon realized that algorithms could not remain static in this
rapidly evolving and expanding environment. Besides document information (location and
frequency of keywords on a webpage) and link analysis (number and quality of hyper-
links) information, the availability of massive amounts of user log information, including
queries, query adaptation, click patterns, and abandonment rates became important in
training ranking algorithms in search engines (Joachims 2002).
Other important advances on earlier IR techniques included the introduction of prob-
abilistic approaches using natural language models (Hiemstra 1998), improving ranking
functionality by the use of term dependence with proximity operators (Metzler and Croft
2005), and incorporating relevance feedback through maximal marginal relevance ranking
(Carbonell and Goldstein 1998).
Search engines also improved on Salton’s vector model to create denser vector-based
indexes with richer semantic representations to enhance recall (Zobel and Moffat 2006).
One of the most notable of these advances has been Word2Vec, a group of related models
created by Google researchers in 2013, which can ingest a large corpus of text to produce
a multi-dimensional vector space. Each unique word in the corpus is positioned within
a word vector (which consists of a numerical list) with words that are semantically and/
or syntactically similar being located closer to one another, while dissimilar words are
located farther away (Mikolov et al. 2013).
The availability of massive amount of data from previous search sessions, vastly
enhanced computing power, and the development of artiﬁcial intelligence neural network
processing capabilities have resulted in a number of new algorithms in recent years. These
machine learning systems arbitrarily assign numerical values to words and then calculate
the statistical likelihood that one particular word will follow another, based on the anal-
ysis of large samples of text with which the system was trained. This analysis is done
by a neural network, each layer of which analyzes a different aspect of the samples it is
provided: deﬁnitions of words, relations of words, phrase, or sentence structures, etc.
Another stage critical to search engine evolution has been the conceptualization of the
web as an implementation of knowledge graphs via linked data and the so-called semantic

9.2

131
web. This added to the original PageRank perspective of a network of authoritative sources
by envisioning “a web of concepts by starting with the current view of the web (comprised
of hyperlinked pages, or documents, each seen as a bag of words), extracting concept-
centric metadata, and stitching it together to create a semantically rich aggregate view of
all the information available on the web for each concept instance” (Dalvi et al. 2009).
Arguably the best-known example of this was Google’s introduction of its “Knowl-
edge Graph” (Singhal 2012), an innovation intended to aggregate factual information
from a wide variety of authoritative and accessible resources such as Wikidata to respond
to queries, all presented on a single search results page. Other search engines such as
Microsoft’s Bing also adopted knowledge graph techniques and technologies, the overall
goal being to ingest and organize available data on entities and their interrelations and
organize these by use of class deﬁnitions and entity relationships within a schema, as
well as to adapt for potentially interrelating arbitrary entities with each other (Heist et al.
2020).
However, as these knowledge graphs are generally proprietary and are seldom transpar-
ent as to their sources, there has been considerable critique of their impartiality and their
inﬂuence (Juel Vang, 2013; Kraft and Usbeck 2022). Google in particular, with its abil-
ity to analyze massive numbers of queries as demonstrated through its “Google Trends”
page showing the most popular of these over time, and its massive U.S. government lob-
bying expenditures on avoiding antitrust measures, is a frequent target for such criticism.
Google’s implementation of the HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol
in 2012 to increase overall online security meant that website owners would no longer be
able to access information on Google queries about their own sites, making Google the
sole owner of this knowledge as well (Craver 2013).
The recently developed transformer language models currently dominate the search
market (Vaswani et al. 2017). These employ deep learning models using algorithms which
can process massive amounts input at once, differentially weighting the signiﬁcance of
each part of the input data by “self-attention,” a mechanism which provides context for
any position in the input sequence in order to generate every word’s embedding repre-
sentation. For example, in the phrases “he is ﬂourishing the cane” and “the ﬁelds of cane
are ﬂourishing,” the words “ﬂourishing” and “cane” would have very different embedding
representations for each.
The transformer language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers), developed by Devlin et al. (2018) at Google and pre-trained with large lan-
guage datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus, forms the current backbone of the Google
search engine, while GPT3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), developed by Radford
et al. (2019) at OpenAI and pre-trained with the Common Crawl dataset, forms the current
backbone of the Bing search engine.
New variants of transformer language models are continuously being developed for a
wide variety of purposes, including error correction, summarization, and translation. Nev-
ertheless, today’s systems continue to conform to the earliest information retrieval system

blueprint: (a) building an efﬁcient queryable index for each document in the corpus, (b)
retrieving a set of candidates for a given query, and (c) computing a relevance score for
each candidate (Metzler et al. 2021, p. 2). Informed speculation is that Google currently
uses at least 200 factors in its ranking relevance for queries (Dean 2021, p. 2).
9.3
Effects on LIS Practice and Research
The ongoing technologization of information resources has had unexpected effects on
libraries of different types, including school and public libraries. For instance, the U.S.
Children’s Internet Protection Act of 2000, passed with the express purpose of protecting
those under 17 years of age from harmful visual depictions on the Internet, requires school
and public libraries to install Internet ﬁlters on all computers to block certain content,
usually deﬁned by speciﬁc keywords or URLs, in order to receive the federally funded
Universal Service Discount (E-rate) for their Internet technology (Harris 2019).
Although these ﬁlters are intended for young users, all Internet-accessible computers
in institutions receiving such funding must have these ﬁlters installed, though they may be
removed for adult users upon request. Despite a paucity of research on Internet ﬁltering,
current ﬁndings indicate that many libraries block far more categories than necessary to
fulﬁll their legal obligations, that each library’s speciﬁc conﬁguration of ﬁltering varies
signiﬁcantly since it is based on individual administrator decisions, that internet ﬁlters
in general are well-known to underblock and overblock various sites, and that Internet
ﬁltering companies are almost exclusively privately run, making those algorithms used
to manage the ﬁltering processes proprietary trade secrets unavailable to actual users. As
noted, there is a general lack of data regarding these issues (Oltmann et al. 2021). The
political implications of this may even be larger, especially given that keywords related
to formerly acceptable retrieval queries and websites such as those concerning human
reproductive choices may no longer be legal in numerous states (Cardillo 2022).
Technology-driven changes in journal publication and library acquisition practices have
also had a lasting effect on academic research and academic libraries, as rapidly rising
journal prices largely propagated by what law librarian Sarah Lamdan (2022) has called
the “data cartels” in global publishing made libraries and researchers turn to alternatives
such as increased reliance on interlibrary loan networks, various forms of institutional
repositories, and open access publishing.
For librarians, the emphasis on keywords and keyword matching as facilitated by com-
mercial databases and search engines has always been somewhat problematic, given the
traditional emphasis on the educated use of library classiﬁcation systems and the desire to
provide a much broader and richer research experience, often facilitated by librarians and
a wide variety of user resources. While the use of “free text” or unstructured vocabularies
by users for online searching had been a topic of research since long before the advent of

9.3
Effects on LIS Practice and Research
133
the Internet (Markey 2007a, b; Markey et al. 1980), and the utility of user-supplied key-
words has been well-recognized for decades (Tillotson 1995), as search engines began to
replace library catalogs as the accepted starting point for information searching, librarians
bemoaned the unstructured messiness of the Internet itself in comparison with the wealth
of knowledge available in libraries (Taylor 1995).
In their analysis of over a million public queries to an early search engine (Excite),
LIS researchers found that these queries differed signiﬁcantly from user queries to more
traditional library databases in that they were shorter and simpler, employing a limited
number of distinctive terms with very high frequency, and seemingly had the potential to
change the nature of information retrieval research as a whole (Jansen et al. 2000; Spink
et al. 2001).
This wealth of newly available resources, however heterogenous in nature, increasingly
led librarians to reconsider their traditional bibliographic data practices within a larger, or
“metadata,” context (Borbinha 2004) while others suggested that such practices no longer
sufﬁce in a “resource discovery” era (Han, 2012). Tagging, or social folksonomies, was
adapted for users of library systems to identify items of particular interest to them shortly
after user-created labels known as “tags” or “hashtags” became prevalent among users
on such popular Internet platforms as Flickr and Twitter (Rafferty 2018). More impor-
tantly, academic libraries began turning toward linked open data in such open Creative
Commons-licensed repositories as Wikidata (Tharani 2021) in order to make progress
toward the promise of what Berners-Lee named the Semantic Web for sharing and pub-
licizing library resources, though that progress has been slow compared to Google’s and
Microsoft’s much more efﬁcient exploitation of Wikidata for their own proprietary knowl-
edge graphs. Today, academic libraries in particular are turning to “semantic search” as
a way of incorporating new linguistic advances into their discovery technologies (Eller
2022).
LIS’s research shift in knowledge organization systems topics has also been gradual.
Si et al. (2023) found that the dominant knowledge organization topics in LIS research
publications from 1993 through 2007 were cataloguing and classiﬁcation, then from
2008 through 2013 classiﬁcation schemes, thesauri, cataloguing and bibliographic control,
application in speciﬁc domains, and ontology predominated, while after 2013, the dom-
inant topics have been ontology applications, domain ontology development, ontology
evaluation, linked applications, and linked publishing.
When dealing with Internet-related topics, the focus of much of this LIS research,
with some exceptions such as Jansen (2011) and Lewandowski (2011), has been on so-
called “organic” results (that is, keyword results from those websites that haven’t paid
the search engine for their inclusion) as those are most similar to the results of library
collection searches.
There has been considerable critique from LIS of the evolving search engine industry,
ranging from Jeanneney’s (2007) scathing denunciation of Google’s unsystematic digi-
tization of the holdings of a large number of academic libraries for its Google Books

134

initiative, to Hjørland’s (2012) considered opinion on the enduring value of knowledge
organization as a professional rather than commercial practice, to Palfrey’s (2015) defense
of libraries as the last strongholds of civic literacy and engagement in an increasingly
virtual and commercialized world, to Sauvayre’s (2022) in-depth analysis of the preva-
lence of citation errors in Google Scholar data. But, in general, there appears to be wide
acceptance in LIS of the dominant position of search engines in the modern information
landscape, and, accordingly, the necessity of ﬁnding ways to increase digital information
literacy, even as Google, for instance, touts its own efforts to make this critical skill easier
for its users (Nayak 2022).
Today search engines such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo have become the search
platform of choice for all but the most limited of in-collection inquiries, and librarians
themselves are routinely expected to learn the basics of search engine marketing and
search engine optimization for their own library websites, and to adapt and adopt many
search engine modiﬁcations for their own systems. With the increasing importance of the
so-called “web scale discovery services,” (Raieli 2022) in which external web content is
brought together with internal library resources to form an aggregated core collection,
library search systems are no longer insulated from the Internet and much library instruc-
tion today focuses on “information literacy” intended to help users differentiate between
accurate and inaccurate sources of information in any kind of search activity (Head et al.
2022).
Considered as a search “platform” (Gillespie 2010), the library discovery system has
always been expected to display a professionally circumspect and deliberately circum-
scribed approach to directing users toward any speciﬁc search results on a list of all
possible matches to their queries, though there has been increasing evidence that implicit
bias is endemic to such systems as well (Reidsma 2019). A major competitor to library
discovery systems, the Google Scholar search platform, has been argued to have disrup-
tive effects that impact the scholarly community in opaque, highly quantitative ways that
weaken academic autonomy and disciplinary functioning (Goldenfein and Grifﬁn 2022).
Recently, Google researchers also have proposed to “re-think search” by moving from
the conventional keyword search model to a question and answer model by utilizing pre-
trained language models to respond to natural language queries from online users as a
way of promoting user engagement by simulating advice from domain experts (Metzler
et al. 2021). The improvement in question answering technologies, especially for factu-
ally based queries, in recent years (Zhang et al. 2023) makes this hardly an unexpected
development.
However, this proposed advance has prompted criticism that Google’s stated vision
of speed, convenience, and increased user engagement relegates information searching
as “a socially and contextually situated activity with diverse sets of goals and needs for
support” to an opaque “combination of text matching and text generating algorithms”
and that a preferable vision should include support for a wide variety of information
search intentions and information seeking strategies as well as transitions between them,

9.3

a clear way for the user to carry interactions with the system with iterations of request-
response that carry the knowledge from previous interactions to the next, support for these
interactions through various modalities and modes of communication, including different
types of devices, interfaces, languages, expression of information need (keywords-based
queries, questions, gestures, etc.), support for increasing users’ information literacy, the
provision of sufﬁcient transparency about the sources where the information objects are
coming from, as well as the process through which they are either ranked or consolidated
and presented, and the system should be free of economic structures that support and even
incentivize the monetization of concepts (such as identity terms) and allow commercial
interests to masquerade as ‘objective’ information” (Shah and Bender 2022).
Transparency about algorithms and data sources alone, however, are unlikely to pro-
vide the level of accountability that would make the operations of a search engine such
as Google, with its continuous cycle of proprietary algorithm updates, understandable to
its external stakeholders such as government and users (Ananny and Crawford 2018).
Although more transparent alternatives to commercial search engines have recently been
proposed, such as Zhitomirsky-Geffet’s open network of inter-linked knowledge organiza-
tion systems with multiple validity scopes (Zhitomirsky-Geffet 2019; Zhitomirsky-Geffet
and Hajibayova 2020), it seems likely that the contents of such a system, if developed,
would quickly be ingested by commercial search engines, as is currently the case with
WikiData, and incorporated into new algorithms, with uncertain results.
Sundin et al. (2022) approach the problem from a different aspect: that of viewing
search engines as “multi-relevance machines” which, they suggest, would beneﬁt from
incorporating “societal relevance” into search engine results (as they believe that Google
has already done in the special case of medical information during the COVID-19 pan-
demic). “Societal relevance” would join the common relevance categories of system
(unpersonalized) and individual (personalized) relevance, especially in instances where
societal interests could be considered paramount, such as disaster situations, in which cur-
rent, correct, and manually curated information would be vital. They note that this type of
“relevance” would pose its own dilemmas both for search engines and users, highlighting
issues such as absence of data, political implications, and strategic ignorance, and urge
that LIS researchers need to study commercial search engine practices, processes, and
results much more actively than they have done to date.
Hjørland (2021) has drawn from the philosophy of science in his current proposal
that both information retrieval and knowledge organization need to be rethought in order
to emphasize the importance of understanding that “the literature (or ‘the universe of
recorded knowledge’) in which we perform IR cannot just be considered bits of true
knowledge in which each bit is as good as any other. On the contrary, the literature
must be understood as a mixture of different voices, some of which conﬂict with each
other. The relevance of a given search set of documents (or a given relevance ranking of
documents) is therefore a hypothesis, the answer to which concerns the conﬂict between

136

different paradigms in the subject area”, which he argues can be addressed by understand-
ing these paradigms and by developing “pragmatic and critical theories acknowledging the
role of goals, interests, and consequences in knowledge.” This expansion of Hjørland’s
earlier seminal work on relevance and domain discourse into “the universe of recorded
knowledge” brings new problems, since neither information science nor librarianship tra-
ditionally engages in the broader type of social epistemology that such activities would
inevitably entail (Van der Veer Martens 2015, pp. 320–324).
This is not to say that such a widening in scope for LIS would be undesirable, given
that “the universe of recorded knowledge” is clearly contiguous to if not already subsumed
within the rapidly expanding infosphere. The next chapter will explore the various ways
in which keywords are being used to attract, inﬂuence, and retain today’s search engine
users.

Abstract
This chapter explores the evolution and economics of search engine results pages, the
rise of computational advertising, search engines and the public sphere, and the poten-
tial future of search engines as supplemented and/or supplanted by artiﬁcial intelligence
chatbots.
Online search activities have become so pervasive today that they are considered almost
invisible (Sundin et al. 2017). Users employ major search engines such as Bing and
Google for everyday exploratory, informational, navigational, and transactional queries
(Broder 2002; Palagi et al. 2017) or various combinations of each (Li et al. 2022) with the
expectation of reasonably relevant (Abualsaud and Smucker 2022) and credible (Peterson
et al. 2022) results. This chapter discusses how these expectations relate to the realities
of search engines today and their potential futures.
10.1
Search Engine Results Pages
Commercial search engines have substantial incentives to facilitate the search process
through both privatizing and publicizing the search platform on which it takes place
(Airoldi and Rokka 2022). The earliest versions of so-called “sponsored search” (the use
of keywords in a search engine to point to online advertising sites) matched user-input
keywords with relevant advertisements using standard information retrieval algorithms
(bag-of-words features like tf-idf) in which each ad was treated as a document con-
sisting of textual information such as the advertising copy and the bid keyword. Since
then, Google has devoted massive research attention to natural language query linguis-
tics, notably its recent Multitask Uniﬁed Model (MUM), which is said to be 1,000 times

more powerful than BERT, since it is trained across 75 different languages and has the
capacity to understand both images and text (Nayak 2021). Bing has devoted more atten-
tion to its coverage of websites, developing IndexNow, an open source protocol which
allows website owners to immediately notify Bing of changes in their sites rather than
waiting for search engine crawlers to discover these changes (Schwartz 2021), with the
goal of providing the most up-to-date site information for users.
Crane (2011, p. 113) observed that “The technological affordances of search engine
interfaces and the attending user experiences materially anchor the discursively con-
structed myth of disintermediation in design and practice. …Results give the impression
of neutrality because they are organized according to ranking systems rationalized by the
scientistic logic of computation.” Visible on every search engine results page (SERP),
however, there is evidence of the continuing tension among what users want (accessible,
affordable, and reasonably accurate answers to their questions), what organizations want
(cost-effective, immediate, and presumably proﬁtable linkage to their proprietary con-
tent), and what commercial search engine providers want (comprehensive control over
this “matching” process, regardless of the speciﬁcs of the individual queries or content).
Hargittai (2000, p. 235) correctly identiﬁed the generic source of this tension as being
the result of the relative abundance of available information and the relative scarcity of
attention for that information in general, but neglected its converse in the particular: the
relative scarcity of certain speciﬁc information and the relative abundance of attention for
that information, much of which tends to be ﬁnancial in nature. As Segev (2010) noted,
this tension marks some of the most disputed territories within the global search engine
society. The increase in so-called “search engine law” is indicative of the extent of its
societal impact (Grimmelmann 2007; Volkoh and Falk 2012) in protecting both propri-
etary content and the public interest in an environment in which technological advances
routinely outpace regulatory responses.
Various speciﬁc issues of information access, both legal and illegal, are constantly cir-
culating around search engines. The analysis of Google search trends, as a predictor of
global issues such as public health (Lin et al. 2020) or as a monitor of the diffusion of
conspiracy theories (Ballatore 2015), the detection of online child sexual abuse (Lee et al.
2020), increases in cybercrime (Moneva et al. 2022), changing societal mores (Mejova
et al. 2022), and the prevalence of deliberate disinformation campaigns in both the com-
mercial and political sectors (Bradshaw 2019; Zade et al. 2022) are receiving continual
research attention. Keywords are the surrogates for this tension, as they provide the data
around which the entire search engine industry has been built. It is important to note that
advertisers do not pay for the mere display of their online ads but rather when users click
on these.
Google dominates the online keyword ecology in both organic (non-paid) and spon-
sored (paid) keywords, with its ad tech stack, an extensive series of coordinated
advertising programs that allow advertisers to bid on keywords either within the Google
SERP itself or in other sites that either partner with Google or which incorporate

ads via Google for additional monetization of their own content (Morozovaite 2021).
Lewandowski et al. (2018) classiﬁed the SERP into four sections: organic results, which
are results generated from the search engine’s index of web pages; sponsored results,
which are ads tied to the relevant keywords; universal results, which are generated from
vertical search engine indices such as those for news or images, either similar to organic
results or from a particular collection of pre-deﬁned sources, and knowledge-graph results,
which are answers or facts directly presented in response to the query. Google claims to
maintain a strict separation between its organic and advertising businesses (Google, n.d.a)
but it has become increasingly difﬁcult to distinguish between the various types of results
on a SERP over the years (Farley 2022). Commercial search engines have little incentive
to address this issue, given the ﬁnancial stakes involved (Lewandowski et al. 2020).
The stakes for user attention are clearly very high: the number one organic result on
a SERP can expect to receive a 27.1% click-through rate (CTR) on average, which is
ten times the rate of the 10th result on the SERP (Dean 2022). The CTR for a branded
keyword in this number one position, on the other hand, is a much higher 60.4%, most
likely due to the fact that these are often navigational searches for speciﬁc brands. It is
also important to note that Google’s classiﬁcation algorithms group semantically similar
“search terms” input by users in order to group these as “keywords” on which advertisers
can bid, with speciﬁcations such as an exact match, a broad match, a negative match, or
a phrase match (Google, n.d.b).
Research has repeatedly found that many users still cannot distinguish between a search
engine’s organic (non-paid) and sponsored (paid) results (Lewandowski and Schultheiß
2022), are unaware that there are various ways to improve search results by using search
operators and search settings (Liu et al. 2019) or that there may be dramatic differences
among the top-ranked results from queries to different search engines (Steiner et al. 2022)
or that search engine results on debated topics biased toward a particular viewpoint can
favorably inﬂuence user attitudes toward that viewpoint in the so-called “search engine
manipulation effect” (Draws et al. 2021) or that there is a highly sophisticated search
engine optimization industry among advertisers intended to affect these results (Schultheiß
and Lewandowski 2020).
From an LIS point of view, these are often considered “information literacy” or “media
literacy” issues suggesting the need for more user education or librarian advocacy (Tripodi
et al. 2023). From an advertising or sponsorship point of view, such user engagement with
their online content is actually an indicator of the strength of their “consumer signals” as
part of their “customer journey” and is clearly beneﬁcial (Schweidel et al. 2022). From
a psychological point of view, however, the search engine’s increasingly sophisticated
combination of user personalization within a dynamic “choice environment,” real-time
adaptive feedback to user inputs and actions, its maximization of predictive capacity
through optimization of resources, and the opacity of the algorithms and technologies
involved creates the possibility of “hypernudges” that can lead the user in particular
directions, whether or not these are initially or ultimately desired by the user (Mills 2022).

Computational Advertising
As search engine algorithms become more sophisticated, even to the point of being able
to separate human-written content from that of AI-written content in order to assess vari-
ation in quality (Bahri et al. 2021), so-called “computational advertising,” which involves
granular-level data collection, mining, and aggregation, resulting in highly individualized
and pervasive ad serving, has been developed in response (Helberger et al. 2020).
In their review of the literature on keyword decision-making process by digital adver-
tisers, Yang and Li (2023) describe this process as involving keyword generation at the
domain level, keyword targeting at the market level, keyword assignment and grouping
at the campaign and ad-group level, and dynamic keyword adjustment, often involving
multiple search engines, social media, and other online advertising venues. Long-term
considerations can also come into play, especially in the establishment of a brand posi-
tion, as well as expertise in various consumer click actions within the so-called “purchase
funnel” (Erdmann et al. 2022).
Keyword generation generally starts with “seed” keywords, which represent the domain
knowledge of the target market, which are then expanded as comprehensively as possi-
ble, based either statistically, as shown by co-occurrence relationships among keywords,
through data-mining previous queries, metadata, and other ads, or ontologically, based
on concept hierarchies. The cost of the speciﬁc keyword, whether it refers to a brand or
trademark, whether or not the brand or trademark is strongly defended online, and the
presence or absence of competitors’ bids, all impact the decision process (Simonov et al.
2018). The possibility of “search engine poisoning,” that is, the dilution of a particular
keyword through competitors’ deliberate linkage to misspelled variants (Joslin et al. 2019)
or the deliberate diversion of keyword trafﬁc by cybercriminals from a legitimate result
to an illegal site (Fittler et al. 2022) must also be taken into account.
The frequent modiﬁcations to search engine algorithms and protocols by Google that
impact advertising make this very challenging, since these keyword decisions necessar-
ily interact with many other marketing and advertising decisions, particularly the optimal
budget allocation and bid determination in order to maximize the performance of cam-
paigns. Keyword auction bidding today by major ﬁrms is generally handled by specialized
intermediaries, who also use their own algorithms in order to determine the best bidding
strategy for campaigns across various online venues (Decarolis and Rovigatti 2021).
The 100 most popular keyword searches for 2022 (excluding pornography searches)
in order of frequency were Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, weather, Walmart, Google,
Wordle, Gmail, Target, Home Depot, Google Translate, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo, Costco, Fox
News, Starbucks, food near me, translate, Instagram, Google Maps, Walgreens, Best Buy,

shopping clearly predominated, with weather and sports news a distant second.
In 2022, the 25 most expensive (cost per click) Google AdSense sponsored keyword
phrases were, with some exceptions, not brand speciﬁc: Best 18 wheeler accident lawyer,
Offshore accident attorney, Construction truck accident lawyer, Best motorcycle attorney,

Compare car insurance, and Online marketing degree. Competition among law ﬁrms for
lucrative lawsuit opportunities dominated most of this list, with other business-related
searches a distant second (Schrobo 2022).
Although Google is considered the main focus of the online advertising market, social
media platforms such as Facebook and ecommerce platforms such as Amazon also utilize
keyword bidding auctions for their advertisers. Facebook’s marketing algorithms focus
on audience demographics, interests, and behaviors within the Facebook environment in
order to determine which of the relevant sponsored ads will be shown to individual users.
Amazon employs a product relevance ranking algorithm in addition to its keyword bidding
auction.
With 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide, Google currently has roughly 83% of
the global search market, while Bing has about 9%, and Yahoo approximately 2.5%. The
Baidu search engine, however, has 86% of all search engine users in China, while the
Yandex search engine has over 59% of all search engine users in Russa (Bianchi 2023).
Online advertising-related search revenues in the US for 2021 have been estimated
at $78.3 billion (Internet Advertising Bureau 2022), while online advertising revenue for
Google alone totaled $209.49 billion, which is approximately 80% of its parent company
Alphabet’s total revenue (Bianchi 2022b).

Search Engines and the Public Sphere
Shackell (2021) argues that existing trademark law, originally intended to reduce search
costs for consumers, has been exploited by Google and other search engines in that trade-
marks such as “Google” have become “super-generic” because they are both common in
everyday language about search and, more crucially, structurally entailed in search. He
notes that “a small number of ﬁrms now hold trademarks on functions whose pre-Internet
equivalents were generic actions such as ‘seeking’ or ‘looking around.’ The social costs
and hidden externalities created are so ubiquitous and complex that they may take gener-
ations to fully perceive and understand” (2021, p. 19). While U.S. trademark law does not
currently prohibit the use of competitors’ trademarks in search engine advertising or hold
search engines liable for any infringement (Franklyn and Hyman 2013), India for exam-
ple has enacted regulations that do make search engines liable (Pandey 2021). Ironically,
Google, like other major technology ﬁrms, very vigorously defends its own trademarks
(Pritchard 2022).
Further, the larger search engines such as Google and Baidu operate as quasi-
monopolies (Si et al. 2022). The U.S. Justice Department ﬁled an anti-trust lawsuit
against Google in 2020, claiming that Google exerts monopolistic power over general
Internet search services in the United States, search advertising in the United States, and
general search text advertising in the United States and citing speciﬁc harms to consumers
and competitors due to Google’s extensive contractual arrangements with leading man-
ufacturers to be the default search engine provided in their products (Bet et al. 2022).
Google Chief Economist Hal Varian argues to the contrary, stating that actual economic
data for Google shows that such claims are without merit (Varian 2021).
Regardless of the outcome of this particular case, Google’s growing power over infor-
mation access troubles many observers. Google has been the target of various lawsuits
claiming that their First Amendment rights had been curtailed by the search engine’s
algorithms and policies, although most of these have been decided in Google’s favor as
a result of its constant defense that its practices are “editorial” in nature, similar to that
of a newspaper editor selecting speciﬁc news stories to run, and that such practices are
protected by free speech doctrines. Petersen (2022, p. 12) points out that this analogy
is misleading at best: “declaring search engines akin to editors evades complexity in the
hope that the companies will either act as trustees of the public interest, diagnosing what
informational policies best serve the public interest and enacting them, or that the compa-
nies’ interests will align with those of the users or public through the alchemy of market
mechanisms.”
Search engines are also criticized for their aggregation of news items, which are said
to have had deleterious effects on traditional news channels (Chyi et al. 2016) and also
for a lack of transparency regarding how news sources are algorithmically selected for
dissemination of their news items (Nechushtai and Lewis 2019).

10.3
Search Engines and the Public Sphere
147
Of particular concern is the role of search engines in the dissemination of political
information, with their unchecked ability to both amplify and distort perspectives on var-
ious issues, as a result of the ongoing technological transformation of the public arena
during the twenty-ﬁrst century (Jungherr and Schroeder 2021). Kawakami et al. (2020)
identiﬁed 56 news sources that contributed two thirds of the so-called “Top Stories” (a
panel of recent news stories shown at the top of the SERP) for 30 political candidates
running in the primaries for the 2020 U.S. presidential election and then surveyed voters
to see how familiar they were with these sources, ﬁnding that some of the most frequent
outlets were not familiar to all voters or were not particularly trusted by voters of any
political persuasion, leading the researchers to the conclusion that Google was attempting
to sample news articles from sources with different political learnings to offer balanced
coverage. The researchers note that this is reminiscent of the “fairness doctrine” policy
required of broadcast media up until 1997 to air contrasting views about controversial
matters. However, because there are more centrist and left-leaning web publications than
right-leaning ones, this sampling provided hyper-partisan far-right news sources with more
visibility than other, more familiar, and trusted sources received.
Hu et al. (2019) analyzed Google search snippets from numerous webpages about
American political issues and discovered that these brief top of page summaries ampliﬁed
their partisan viewpoints rather than providing objective summaries of the webpages, most
likely due to Google’s use of extractive rather than abstractive summarization in providing
the snippets. In the ﬁrst large-scale study of publicly available platform disclosures of
political advertising during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, researchers found that
these fell woefully short of any promised transparency (Papakyriakopoulos et al. 2022).
Fukuyama et al. (2021) have suggested that one possible solution to the current infor-
mation dominance of search engines such as Google would be for government to mandate
a new layer of independent, competitive middleware services with transparent algorithms
to serve as gatekeepers between users and the search engines, which would allow users
to better determine how information is curated, ﬁltered, and presented to them. Another
proposal is to create a separate index on top of a public infrastructure open to everyone,
which could form the basis for myriad search engines and other services utilizing Web
data (Lewandowski 2019).
Meanwhile, Google’s ongoing expansion into mobile technologies has helped to make
it almost omnipresent in daily life, as 61% of all Google users accessed it through their
mobile phones in 2020 and Google currently has a 93.25% share of the U.S. mobile
search market (Bianchi 2022a). Accordingly, Google now employs mobile-ﬁrst indexing,
which means that the mobile version of a website is preferentially indexed and ranked
and that having such a mobile-friendly version is strongly recommended as a best practice
for all websites. Google Maps’ dominance in the online mapping applications category is
clearly evident in this as well (Ceci 2023).

148

Algorithms, Users
Zuboff (2015) argues that Google in particular has proﬁted from what she terms
“surveillance capitalism” in which user data (queries, metadata, and associated informa-
tion) are offered in exchange for free use of the search engine’s services and are then
stored, mined, aggregated, processed, and utilized for a wide variety of business purposes
which are both opaque to users and highly proﬁtable to Google. Zuboff points out as well
that Google’s search operations are so sophisticated that U.S. government intelligence
agencies have used it as a model for their own surveillance systems.
Velkova and Kaun (2021, p. 526) suggest, however, that users and algorithms can
and do engage in co-creation and co-curation of this data, offering multiple opportunities
for both resistance and repair: “the dominant politics through which algorithmic power
functions is an attention politics that deﬁnes dominant meanings and representations of
objects, people and events. At the same time, what counts as worth being promoted or
demoted by algorithms is shaped in a complex interplay between them and users. Algo-
rithms are dependent on users for the queries that make them work and for the generation
of data. User-generated data must be produced and aggregated so that algorithms can
start to ‘deﬁne which information is to be included in an analysis; [and] envision, plan
for, and execute data trans-formations’ (Ananny 2016, p. 98). On the other hand, users
are not passive observers in this process. They increasingly recognize the role that they
play in shaping the workings of algorithms, and they have begun to strategically intervene
in political, commercial, or playful ways in the algorithmic politics of attention.” Some
of the ways in which consumers resist are algorithm hacking (Muhl 2020), ad avoidance
and blocking (Todri 2022), actively complaining and critiquing (Grifﬁn and Lurie 2022),
critical ignoring (Kozyreva et al. 2022), and the self-imposing of ﬁlter bubbles to avoid
particular types of content (Ekström et al. 2022).
10.4
The Future of Search
The recent release of the artiﬁcial intelligence conversational agent, ChatGPT by AI Lab,
however, is said to have the potential to disrupt the current search engine environment with
the agent’s ability to provide engaging question and answer responses to natural language
queries (Grant and Metz 2022). ChatGPT is a product of the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-
trained Transformer 3) transformer neural network model, which was trained on roughly
45 terabytes of text (equivalent to 300 billion words) run through 175 billion parameters.
Microsoft is reported to be readying to insert ChatGPT capabilities into its Bing search
engine (Bass 2023), however, the beta release has been ﬁlled with factual, technical,
ethical, and even existential problems (Warren 2023; Willison 2023). The Chinese search
engine Baidu is similarly engaged in launching a AI-based chatbot named Ernie Bot (Soo
2023).
Although Google already has a similar AI-based generative language model in develop-
ment called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications), the challenge is clearly

not merely a technological one, though Google has expressed concerns that such models
are not yet suitable for wide popular release, given their known biases and inaccuracies.
And, indeed, Google’s promotional launch of its artiﬁcial intelligence conversation agent,
Bard, was marred by an embarrassing factual mistake that Bard produced in Google’s
initial advertisement, which was intended to demonstrate the product’s capabilities. Bard
claimed that the James Webb Space Telescope was the ﬁrst to take photographs of exo-
planets beyond our solar system, when in fact it was the European Southern Observatory’s
Very Large Telescope that did so in 2004: an egregious error that cost Google’s parent
company Alphabet $100 billion as its share price fell in response to the ensuing ridicule
(Olson 2023).
However, the real economic challenge is that an efﬁcient and effective response to
a natural language query, either textual or verbal, does not provide much room for the
advertising and associated information that underpins most current search engines’ busi-
ness models. For instance, on January 2, 2023, the current Google Knowledge Panel
provided in response to the query “How old is planet Earth?” speciﬁed “4.534 billion
years, plus or minus about 50 million years” at the top, with a link to the National Geo-
graphic’s Age of Earth Collection, as well as offering numerous additional links on the
rest of the SERP. The ﬁrst 10 of these were: NationalGeographic, Space.com, Answersin-
Genesis.org, the American Museum of Natural History, Wikipedia, HowStuffWorks.com,
New Scientist, Smithsonian magazine, EarthSky.org, and the Encyclopedia Britannica.
Despite the fact that these results are clearly organic, almost all of them beneﬁt in some
measure from the publicity offered by proximity to what can be perceived as the deﬁni-
tive scientiﬁc answer to a common query. The same query placed on the Bing search
engine resulted in the same answer, supported by the National Geographic’s Age of Earth
Collection, followed by an “Explore Further (Recommended to You Based on What’s
Popular)” list of links to NatureNoon.com, Christianity.com, NationalGeographic.com,
ScienceTrends.com, and BibleStudy.com, with a similarly varied assortment of additional
links following these. It is unclear how a dialogue with a search engine conversational
agent could successfully incorporate more information than the basic response.
However, the reliance of search engines on their sponsored search revenue may be
the deciding factor in the next wave of keyword innovation, which could be a more
multimodal culture of interactive communication, as shown by the popularity of such
voice assistants as Google’s Siri (Moriuchi 2019) and Baidu’s DuerOS (Shen et al. 2022)
and the potential for memory-prompting by these devices as well as for ordinary search
activities (Atkinson and Barker 2021). All this could well represent an updated version
of Vannevar Bush’s celebrated concept of an individual researcher’s “associative trails”
while using the hypothetical “Memex” that could instead be termed an individual user’s
“accumulative trails” while using those search engines available today. What Bush could
not envision was the uses to which governments, commercial entities, and even criminal
enterprises could put the keywords found in such individual and aggregated trails on the

Internet. At this point, however, we can: though what can or should be done is a topic of
continued debate that is likely to generate many new keywords in future.
