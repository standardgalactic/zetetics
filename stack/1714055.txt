 In his report "Radio map of the
 Andromeda galaxy" (24 July, p. 389),
 John M. MacLeod reported the results
 of observing the nearby galaxy M 31
 with the new University of Illinois radio
 telescope. At about the same time a
 paper of mine appeared in the Astro-
 physical Journal (139, p. 1045) analyz-
 ing the spiral structure of M 31. Put-
 ting the results of the two investigations
 together now reveals an unexpected and
 intriguing puzzle.

 My new star arm and schematic spi-

 N 4. As a result the three maxima of
 610 mcy/sec radiation coincide with
 three major axis crossings of spiral
 arms (N 2, S 3, and N 4). But this is
 one single arm that is outlined. The
 symmetrically opposite spiral arm does
 not seem to register in the mapping.
 An even more startling point is that
 the arm which MacLeod observes to
 radiate is the arm which I suggested
 was attached to M 31's dwarf elliptical
 companion, M 32 (at S 5). If my esti-
 mate of the situation is correct, then we
 have a problem which involves the na-
 ture of galaxies and unsuspected physi-
 cal phenomena.

 Learning and Performance: A Dis
 Learning and Performance: A Dis
 Woolley and van der Hoeven have
 recently published two reports (1, 2)
 which purport to show changes in
 "learning ability" as a function of the
 amount of serotonin in the brain. In
 most learning experiments the depend-
 ent variable (change in behavior) and
 the independent variable (in the case of
 the Woolley and van der Hoeven study,
 changes in brain serotonin) are directly
 observable, whereas the intervening
 variable (learning), which links the in-
 dependent with the dependent variable,
 cannot be observed directly. Learning
 is usually reflected by changes in per-
 formance, but it is obvious that changes
 in performance can arise from sources
 other than the learning process (such
 as fatigue).
 In the initial Woolley and van der
 Hoeven study experimental animals
 were treated with compounds which ma-
 nipulate the serotonin content of the
 brain. After these manipulations, the
 animals, along with untreated controls,
 were permitted to explore a T maze for
 2 minutes and were then immediately
 given ten test trials in the same maze.
 Woolley and van der Hoeven attributed
 differences between the experimental
 animals and the controls to changes in
 "learning ability" induced by changes
 in the serotonin content of the brain
 (1). The choice of the term "changes
 in learning ability" is not justified by
 the experimental design, since the drug

 (1). The choice of the term "changes
 in learning ability" is not justified by
 the experimental design, since the drug
 effect was not restricted to the learning
 period. In fact, they say later in the
 same report that there were no differ-
 ences in performance when the mice
 were retested "several days after cessa-
 tion of the treatments." The absence of
 differences between groups after the
 drug effects were dissipated would seem
 to indicate that the treated mice showed
 neither better nor poorer "learning
 ability" than the untreated mice and
 that it was performance, rather than
 learning, that was affected by the ex-
 perimental conditions.
 Although Woolley and van der Hoe-
 ven acknowledged in the first report
 that the compound they employed to
 decrease cerebral serotonin decreased
 catechol amines also, in referring to this
 experiment in the second report they
 say that they related the increases in
 learning ability "specifically to the de-
 ficiency of serotonin." It would have
 been well to attempt to decrease norep-
 inephrine selectively with a compound
 such as ac-methyl-m-tyrosine (3).

 We were well aware that some of
 the means we used to alter the sero-
 tonin content of the brains of the ani-
 mals also alter the catechol amine con-
 tents, and mentioned this fact in our
 papers. We were also at some pains
 to determine whether the observed
 changes in learning ability were due
 to the changes in serotonin or to the
 concomitant changes in catechol amines.
 To do this we used independent meth-
 ods of changing the hormone contents.
 Catechol amines were caused to increase
 in the brains by administration of dihy-
 droxyphenylalanine. This did not change
 the learning ability, whereas by con-
 trast, when serotonin was caused to
 increase specifically by administration of
 hydroxytryptophan, the change in learn-
 ing ability was found. We did not use
 a-methyl-m-tyrosine because there are
 conflicting statements in the literature
 as to whether it causes changes in
 catechol amines alone, or in serotonin
 as well as in catechol amines.
 McMillan also criticizes us for not
 distinguishing between learning and
 performance. The first of our two pa-
 pers mentioned our concern about this
 question and told something of what we
 did about it experimentally. The test-
 ing procedure was designed so as to
 give some information about this point.
 For example, by changing the time al-
 lowed for learning, one can get infor-
 mation about whether the change in
 performance is the result of an effect
 on learning or whether it is due to
 other causes. The fact that the animals
 did not remember for a long time what
 they had learned did not mean they
 had not learned it. There is a short-
 term memory and a long-term memory.
 We were studying a short-term mem-
 ory. Because a report in Science must
 be limited in length, it was not possible
 to say much about these questions or
 about other important points.
 We do not want to give the impres-
 sion that we feel that either of the
 very complicated problems raised by
 McMillan has been settled completely.
 We wish only to point out that we
 were very much aware of them in our
 work, and did something to throw light
 on them.
