Oblate and Prolate
An oblate cylindrical body is disc shaped (I84I>); a prolate cylindrical
body is cigar shaped (I8o I>). See Figure O.1.
Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s law states that the current, I, is proportional to the potential
diﬀerence, Df:
I ¼ Df
R
where R is the resistance of the conducting medium. With current in
amperes (A) and potential diﬀerence in volts (V), the resistance is in
ohms (O). The law is also commonly written V ¼ IR, with V the po-
tential diﬀerence.
Operator
An operator, bO, is an instruction to modify (carry out an operation on)
an entity. A mathematical operation is an operation on a function, such

as diﬀerentiation or multiplication by x. The corresponding operators
are d/dx and x  (the multiplication sign is commonly omitted).
A symmetry operation is an operation on an entity (such as a rotation)
that leaves it apparently unchanged.
A linear operator is a mathematical operator with the property that
bO( f þ g) ¼ bOf þ bOg
Diﬀerentiation and multiplication are linear operators; exponentia-
tion is not. An Hermitian operator is one for which
ð
f bOg dt ¼
ð
g bOf dt


The eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real. Eigenfunctions
corresponding to diﬀerent eigenvalues of an Hermitian operator are
orthogonal. All observables in quantum mechanics correspond to
linear, Hermitian operators.
The order in which operators are applied is in general significant,
for it is not always the case that bO1bO2 f ¼ bO2bO1 f. The commutator of
two operators is defined as
[bO1;bO2] ¼ bO1bO2  bO2bO1
Only operators that commute (that is, have a commutator equal to 0)
have simultaneous eigenfunctions: see uncertainty principle. A funda-
mental proposition of quantum mechanics is that
[bq; bpq0] ¼ iˉhdqq0;
q; q0 ¼ x; y; z
Many conclusions can be inferred from the commutation prop-
erties of operators (such as almost the whole of the theory of angular
momentum) while leaving the operators in an abstract form, as here.
However, it is often appropriate to deal with a representation of the
operators in actual mathematical form. Here are two representations
of the fundamental commutation relation:
Position representation: bq ¼ q;
bpq ¼ ˉh
i
@
@q
Momentum representation: bpq ¼ pq;
bq ¼  ˉh

@pq
Operator representations of other dynamical variables may be built
from these fundamental representations. See Hamiltonian.

Optical Activity
Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarization of light
when it passes through a sample. The eﬀect arises from the phase
diﬀerence introduced as a result of circular birefringence, the dif-
ferent speeds of propagation of left- and right-circularly polarized
radiation through the medium (Figure O.2). See birefringence. If the
sample rotates the beam to the right as seen by the observer looking
towards the oncoming beam, the sample is dextrorotatory and de-
noted (þ). If the sample rotates the beams the left, the sample is
laevorotatory and denoted (). Optical activity is a property of chiral
molecules, those lacking an Sn axis of improper rotation.
Orbital
An orbital is a one-electron wavefunction in an atom or molecule. See
atomic orbital and molecular orbital.
Orbital Angular Momentum
In classical physics, orbital angular momentum, l, is defined as
l ¼ r  p
The three components are
lx ¼ ypz  zpy;
ly ¼ zpx  xpz;
lz ¼ xpy  ypx
and the square of the magnitude is
l2 ¼ l2

In quantum mechanics, these observables are treated as operators
that obey the commutation relations
[blx;bly] ¼ iˉhblz and cyclic permutations;
[bl
2;blq] ¼ 0; q ¼ x; y; z
It follows that only the magnitude and any one of the components
may be specified. The eigenfunctions, subject to cyclic boundary
conditions (and therefore for orbital motion but not spin), are the
spherical harmonics, Yl;ml(y; f), with
bl
2Yl;ml(y; f) ¼ l(l þ 1)ˉh2Yl;ml(y; f);
blzYl;ml(y; f) ¼ mlˉhYl;ml(y; f)
That is, the allowed values are:
Magnitude: {l(l þ 1)}1=2ˉh;
l ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .
z-Component: mlˉh;
ml ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .; l
In a hydrogenic atom, the value of l is constrained by another
boundary condition and cannot exceed n  1, where n is the principal
quantum number. In general, angular momentum increases with the
number of angular nodes in the wavefunction (the spherical
harmonics).
The total orbital angular momentum of a collection of particles is
specified by the quantum numbers L and ML with their values found
from the Clebsch–Gordan series.
Order of Reaction
If a rate law can be written in the form
v ¼ kr[A]a[B]b   
then it is classified as a-order in A, b-order in B, and so on, and its
overall order is a þ b þ  . The order may be 0, integral, fractional, or
negative. If all reactants and products except A are in great excess,
they may be regarded as constant and the rate law is the pseudo-a
order (commonly, when a ¼ 1, pseudofirst-order) in A, with
v ¼ kr;eff[A]a
with the constant concentrations of the other participants absorbed
into the eﬀective rate constant.
The order of a reaction is an empirical quantity, and only in special
cases (elementary reactions) can it be inferred from the stoichiometry

Orthogonality
Two wavefunctions ca and cb are orthogonal if
ð
cacb dt ¼ 0
where the integration is over all space (Figure O.3). It is a general
feature of quantum mechanics that two eigenfunctions of an Her-
mitian operator are orthogonal if they correspond to diﬀerent
eigenvalues. In group theory, two functions are orthogonal if they
span diﬀerent irreducible representations of the relevant point group.
Oscillator Strength
The oscillator strength, f, of a transition i - f is related to the transi-
tion dipole moment mif and the frequency, n, of the transition by
f ¼ 8p2men
3ˉhe

It is so defined that f ¼ 1 for a transition in a three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, and therefore for an atom its value is an indi-
cation of how much the actual transition resembles such an oscil-
lation. The oscillator strength is determined experimentally by

Osmosis
Osmosis is the tendency of a solvent to flow into a more concentrated
solution through a semipermeable membrane, a membrane that per-
mits passage of the solvent molecules but not the solute. It is an ex-
ample of a colligative property, one that depends on the number of
solute molecules present but not their identity. The eﬀect arises from
the tendency of the solvent to equalize its chemical potential on each
side of the membrane to compensate for the presence of the solute:
the solute lowers the chemical potential of the solvent and a pressure,
the osmotic pressure, P, must be applied to the solution to restore it
to the value characteristic of the pure solvent (Figure O.4). If the solution
is ideal, then the osmotic pressure is given by the van ’t Hoﬀequation:
P ¼ RT[B]
where [B] is the molar concentration of the solute.
To allow for departures from ideality, this expression is extended to
P ¼ RT[B](1 þ B[B] þ  )
where B is the second osmotic virial coeﬃcient. The procedure of osmo-
metry is the application of the measurement of osmotic pressure to the
determination of molar mass, particularly of macromolecules. In this
application (which has largely been replaced by mass spectrometry),
the osmotic virial equation is expressed in terms of the mass concen-
tration of the solute, cB ¼ [B]M, where M is the molar mass, and written

Then a plot of P/cB against cB should be a straight line with an
intercept RT/M at cB ¼ 0.
A more formal approach to the osmotic pressure of nonideal
solutions notes that
P ¼  RT ln aA
where aA is the activity of the solvent in the solution. Then the osmotic
activity coeﬃcient, f, is introduced, where
f ¼  r ln aA;
r ¼ xA
xB
Then
P ¼ RT[B]f
Overlap Integral
The overlap integral, S, between two atomic orbitals on neighbouring
atoms is defined as
S ¼
ð
cAcB dt
where the integration is over all space. Overlap integrals are en-
countered in the theory of the chemical bond, where a significant
overlap between atomic orbitals on diﬀerent atoms is an indication
of their contribution to bonding (and antibonding). Analytical
expressions for the overlap of various types of orbitals are available.

Overpotential
The overpotential, Z, is the diﬀerence between the potential of the
electrode and its zero-current potential. The current density, j, at the
electrode varies with overpotential in a manner expressed by
the Butler–Volmer equation. Processes such as gas evolution and
metal deposition proceed at an appreciable rate only if the over-
potential exceeds a critical value, which is typically about 0.1 V for
many reactions but depends strongly on the identity of the electrode
and the type of reaction occurring at it.
Overtone
An overtone in the infrared spectrum of a molecule is a vibrational
transition with Dv41. The first overtone is the second harmonic.
Overtones are observed only in the presence of anharmonicity.
Oxidation
Oxidation is the is the loss of electrons from a species, as in the half-
reaction

Oxidation is accompanied, and can be recognized, by an increase in
oxidation number of an element. Oxidation is often accompanied by
atom transfer. It is the opposite of reduction.
