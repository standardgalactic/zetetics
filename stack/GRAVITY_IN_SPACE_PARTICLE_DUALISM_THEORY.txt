INTRODUCTION 
 
The theory introduced in this chapter is a full overarching quantum 
theory of gravity that is based on both a new interpretation of superpositions 
and a radically new and unconventional way of quantizing space. It was 
developed by the author in 2005 and reached maturity in 2016. That is the 
year in which the true size of those space quanta became clear. The theory 
is called space particle dualism theory, or short SPD. 
The changes it introduces to physics exceed those introduced by GR and 
can be compared to those of QM. GR had a relatively small impact on 
technology, being only relevant to the GPS systems in cars, and while it tries 
to say a lot about cosmology, it has been pretty unsuccessful at making any 
predictions in that area whatsoever. 
SPD on the other hand gives cosmology a solid foundation. It is the 
belief of the author that either 2013 or 2019 will be regarded to be the birth 
year of cosmology. 2013 was when the first concepts of SPD’s cosmology 
were conceived, and 2019 is the year when they were used to calculate the 
post- and pre-decoupling age of the universe. The post-decoupling age of 
the universe is a staggering 42 trillion years. In that same year the author 
has used numerous different methods to prove that this is indeed the correct 
age of the universe. One of the most compelling ways to do so was by taking 
the redshift distance equation of SPD and checking if using this equation 
supernova luminosities drop with the square of the distance or not. It turned 
out they do. It also turned out they don’t do so when the intergalactic 
distances predicted by GR. This result was obtained on the 2019 - 2020 New 
Year’s Eve at precisely 12pm, and accompanied by heavy rain outside. It 
was using the data of 8,846 supernovae. 
What SPD has to say about gravity is no bit less shocking than what it 
says about cosmology. According to SPD, Einstein’s general relativity is not 
even a low-energy approximation to quantum gravity. According to SPD, 
both Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity are in fact so wrong, that they fail 
in a normal lab setting. Experiments conducted by the author in Greece in 
2020, between March and May, have demonstrated that gravity does not 
come from mass, as Newton claimed, and it also does not come from energy,

as Einstein claimed, but it instead comes only from the number of quarks 
contained within an object. 
While Einstein describes gravity as curvature of space, the author 
describes it as density differences in granular space, with every virtual 
particle of the quantum vacuum contributing one quantum of space, one 
elementary space. 
This book is about gravity and I shall therefore focus on the gravity 
aspects of SPD, but I will do that not without first making a brief exposition 
of all the radical key statements that SPD makes overall. For a detailed and 
formal derivation of those statements I will have to refer to my book 
“Quantum Gravity and the Role of Consciousness in Physics”. 
 
 
QUICK OVERVIEW OF SP [ACE PARTICLE  
DUALISM THEORY 
 
Part 1 – The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics 
 
Space particle dualism theory is based on an assembly interpretation of 
quantum mechanics, which is called Similar Worlds Interpretation (SWI), 
and which was conceptualized by the author in 2003 and 2004. This 
interpretation starts off with a classical phase space that has 6 dimensions 
for every particle, 3 dimensions for position and 3 dimensions for impulse. 
Every point represents the universe at a particular state. Similar states are 
close to each other. 
We can imagine the passage of time as a conscious point in phase space 
travelling through phase space. From quantum mechanics however we know 
that the universe is not in just one state at a time. Everything is always in a 
superposition of multiple states. We can account for this by extending our 
‘conscious point’ in phase space to a ‘conscious cloud’. 
Every time a measurement by a conscious observer takes place, the 
‘conscious cloud’ shrinks, and whenever interactions take place 
unmeasured, the ‘conscious cloud’ grows.

Figure 1. We can account for quantum uncertainty by extending the conscious point in 
phase space by a ‘conscious cloud’. 
Ontologically we do not have to regard anything outside the ‘conscious 
cloud’ as real. Operationally it does not make a difference. When viewed 
independently from phase space, the ‘conscious cloud’ is also called the 
‘equivalence group’. It includes all ‘worlds’ which are currently 
indistinguishable. 
The logarithm of the number of those worlds equals the entropy of the 
universe. This interpretation of entropy is strictly quantum mechanical. 
It also shows that quantum mechanics can be derived from Leibniz’s 
identity of indiscernibles. 
In this model there is no spooky action at a distance, because it is no 
longer the particles which are in many states at once, but rather it is us, or 
our consciousness, which is in many worlds at once. 
For momentum conservation reasons, the spins of particles that have 
been created together are orthogonal to each other, and so we do not need to 
wonder how it is that they are orthogonal each time we measure. It does not 
require any information exchange between particles, because entanglement 
information does not need to be encoded in a physical form. It is part of the 
measurement information that gives rise to the ‘equivalence group’. 
Our limited measurement precision and frequency of measurement can 
readily explain why we exist in many worlds at once, but if that was all, then

the probability distribution of a particle would be a simple mountain, while 
we know that in reality it is wavelike. 
What produces this waviness of the probability distribution of particles? 
The answer to this question lies in the fabric of space itself. We shall now 
familiarize ourselves with the constituents of space. 
 
 
PART 2 – THE FABRIC OF SPACE 
 
According to space particle dualism every particle carries its own 
quantum of space, which is a complex 2-sphere with a radius of:  
 
𝑅 = 
2 𝐺𝐸 𝐸
𝑐4   
 
With 𝐺𝐸 being a scaled-up version of the gravitational constant. It is 
constructed by scaling up the gravitational constant to meet in strength with 
the electromagnetic force. 𝐺𝐸 is given by:  
 
𝐺𝐸 = 
𝑘𝑒 𝑒2
𝑚𝑝2   
 
The energy of all particles is a complex number 𝑧 which goes around 
the center of the complex plane. It is this orbit of the number𝑧, which morphs 
the probability distribution of particles into a waves. 
The difference between bosons and fermions can be modelled by using 
complex 2-spheres and complex 1-spheres. 
Anti-particles can be interpreted as particles that have a negative 
imaginary component. 
The theory also allows negative real mass. Something which is referred 
to as exotic matter. Different from general relativity however, exotic matter 
in space particle dualism theory does not have negative gravity. The gravity 
of exotic matter is still positive. However, all of this exotic matter went into 
the formation of primordial exotic holes, which then later evolved into 
supermassive black holes.

The spin-interpretation problem can be solved by realizing that as the 
number 𝑧 goes around the origin there is no difference between the positive 
imaginary component and the negative imaginary component, because 
bosons are their own anti-particles. That is why for bosons the oscillation of 
energy includes fewer states, and thus they behave like objects that have two 
‘faces’, one front- and one backside. Fermions with their four ‘faces’ seem 
like they need to undergo two rotations until they reach their original state. 
Thus they have a spin of ½. 
Space particle dualism also solves the hierarchy problem. Elementary 
spaces, which are 2-dimensional surfaces, overlap to form a seemingly three 
dimensional space. These elementary spaces are the elementary spaces of 
virtual particles. Regions of space with more elementary spaces have more 
pathways leading through them, which results in particles being drawn to 
such areas of space. This is the phenomenon which we call gravity. 
The space quanta we use here are 2-dimensional. The dimensionality of 
the resulting space we can calculate as follows:  
 
D = 2 + (1 − 
1
√𝑛)  
 
With 𝑛 being the number of connections from one elementary space to 
other elemenentary spaces. 
It turns out that 𝑛 is about 1070, and the dimensionality of our space is 
2.999999999999999999999999999999999991. 
 
 
Figure 2. In granular space a straight line is not that straight anymore when we zoom in 
on it.

We can call this the granular dimensionality of the vacuum. It implies 
that any difference in the granular dimensionality of different regions of 
space can only show up after the 35th digit after the decimal point. That 
means that gravity is 1036 than the other forces. The difference between 
electromagnetism and the strong force can be accounted for by the running 
of coupling, or, and which is the same, the cloud of virtual particles around 
charges. Charges emit a constant stream of virtual gauge bosons, and that 
are primarily virtual photons for electromagnetism and virtual gluons for the 
strong force. These virtual photons around charges lead to a slightly higher 
density of granular space around them, which is felt by approaching particles 
as gravity originating from those charges. 
Virtual particles are particles that live for a short time only, and that time 
is set by the time energy uncertainty relation, namely:  
 
∆E × ∆t = 
ℏ
2  
 
Virtual particles that reach further and further away from the charge they 
are emitted from have lower and lower energies. At a certain energy the 
elementary space of the virtual particle is smaller than the Planck length. 
When that happens the elementary spaces does no longer contribute to the 
granular dimensionality of space, and therefore becomes gravitationally 
ineffective. 
This is the reason why the gravity that emerges from the electromagnetic 
force has a reach of only 40 meters. 
Gluons are different. They are self-interacting particles, which is why 
one virtual gluon can give rise to other virtual gluons, and this way gluons 
can reach infinity without losing their gravitational effect. 
 
 
Part 3 – Gravity without the Equivalence Principle 
 
Since all gravity coming from electromagnetism is only short range, we 
can fully focus on gravity from the strong force, which we can call

‘hypergravity’. Accordingly, gravity depends on the number of quarks only. 
The gravitational constant is usually measured using iron objects, and iron 
has a lot of negative binding energy. There are more quarks per kilogram of 
iron than there are in a kilogram of water. 
We can calculate the gravitational constant of a proton gas by 
multiplying the usual gravitational constant with the ratio between an iron 
atom without its electrons (𝑚Fe−e) and the sum of masses of all its 
constituents (protons and neutrons). It yields:  
 
𝐺𝑝 = 𝐺𝐹𝑒 × 
𝑚Fe−e
𝑛𝑝Fe 𝑚𝑝+ 𝑛𝑛Fe 𝑚𝑛  
 
𝐺𝑝 =  6.6009607 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2  
 
If we now want to calculate the gravitational constant of another 
material, such as for example water, we reverse this ratio:  
 
𝐺H2O  = 𝐺𝑝 × 
𝑛𝑝H2O 𝑚𝑝+ 𝑛𝑛H2O 𝑚𝑛
𝑚H2O−e
  
 
𝐺H2O  =  6.6496762 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2  
 
This value has been confirmed by experiments the author conducted in 
Greece in 2020. A video of the experiment has been uploaded on YouTube. 
Details on how the experiment was conducted can be found in his book.  
This has consequences also for the mass of the stellar objects, such as 
the earth, the moon and the sun. We can for example calculate the mass of 
the earth as:  
 
𝑀 = 
𝑔 𝑟2
𝐺Fe  × 
𝑛𝑝Fe 𝑚𝑝+ 𝑛𝑛Fe 𝑚𝑛
𝑚Fe−e
 × 
𝑚a−e𝜇
𝑛𝑝𝜇 𝑚𝑝+ 𝑛𝑛𝜇 𝑚𝑛  
 
𝑀 = [5.9722 ×  1024 kg] × 
56.44938 u
55.83093692 u × 
33.3176080601 u
33.57254248 u   
𝑀 = [5.9722 ×  1024 kg] ×  1.00339941449  

Gravity in Space Particle Dualism Theory

𝑀 =  5.992502 × 1024 kg  
 
That means the earth is 0.34% heavier than we thought. 
We can also define a new and different gravitational constant that is used 
directly with the quark number, which we write as |𝕐|, instead of the mass 
𝑚. 
We can construct it by multiplying the mass-gravity constant of proton 
gases with the square of one third of a proton mass. 
This yields:  
 
𝐺|𝕐|  = 𝐺𝐹𝑒 × 
𝑚Fe−e
𝑛𝑝Fe 𝑚𝑝+ 𝑛𝑛Fe 𝑚𝑛 × 
𝑚𝑝2
9   
 
𝐺|𝕐|  =  2.0519189 × 10−65 m3 kg s−2  
 
We need the square because when calculating gravity it usually involves 
two gravitational objects. However, in the rare case that only one of the 
objects exerts gravity, we use the so called reduced quark gravity constant, 
which is given by:  
 
₲|𝕐|  = 𝐺𝑝 × 
𝑚𝑝
3   
 
₲|𝕐|  =  3.681244 × 10−38 m3 s−2  
 
In space particle dualism Galileo’s free fall postulate is openly violated. 
The gravitational acceleration according to it is:  
 
𝑚 𝑔= 
𝐺|𝕐| |𝕐| |𝕪|
𝑟2
  
 
𝑔 = 
𝐺|𝕐| |𝕐| |𝕪|
𝑚 𝑟2
  

Sky Darmos

On first sight it looks like it is saying that heavier objects feel less 
acceleration, but that would be ignoring the upper term |𝕪|, which is the 
number of quarks. In reality |𝕪| and 𝑚 balance each other out. We can write 
the above equation also as:  
 
𝑔 = 
𝐺𝑝 |𝕐| 
𝑚𝑝
3  |𝕪| 
𝑚𝑝
3
𝑚 𝑟2
  
 
We can see here that the acceleration 𝑔 is mainly dependent on this term:  
 
𝑔 = 
𝐺𝑝 |𝕐| 
𝑚𝑝
3
𝑟2
  
 
With the rest being only a minor correction term, depending on the 
chemical composition of the material dropping:  
 
|𝕪| 
𝑚𝑝
3
𝑚  
 
Direct evidence for differences in the acceleration of objects composed 
of different chemical elements has been found by Fischbach (1986). 
 
 
Part 4 – A Universe that Is 42 Trillion Years Old 
 
Space particle dualism readily solves all problems of cosmology. 
Gravity is based on density differences in granular space, and so in a 
universe with no center and no edges, there cannot be such a thing as global 
gravity. 
That means in SPD the expansion of the universe cannot be slowed 
down by gravity. This solves the vacuum catastrophe problem. In SPD an 
evenly distributed energy cannot have any gravitational effect. Gravity from 
different directions simply cancel out.

The flatness problem is also resolved, because in SPD space does not 
really curve. It is granular. 
In SPD the expansion rate of space is not an arbitrary parameter. The 
cosmology of SPD is based on the concept of ‘entropic expansion’. That 
means space expands in order to compensate for the entropy increase in 
black holes. 
The fact that the entropy of a black hole depends on its surface area 
means that when a black hole’s mass grows linearly, then its entropy grows 
exponentially. The universe of the mainstream starts with a very high speed, 
slows down due to gravity, to then accelerate again. That is why the age of 
the universe is very small in the mainstream. 
In SPD the universe starts with a very low expansion rate, and then 
expands faster and faster. The low initial expansion rate results in a much 
larger age, namely 42 trillion years since decoupling, and a full age of 86 
trillion years since the maximal density and temperature. 
Entropic expansion implies that the entropy density never changes. 
When we look at the universe backwards in time, it can only increase its 
density when its black holes become smaller. At some point they disappear, 
and that is when we have reached the maximal density and temperature. 
Calculations show that that maximal temperature is 6,000 Kelvin. 
Space particle dualism leads to different intergalactic distances. Nearby 
galaxies are three times further away than we think, and the furthest away 
galaxy we know of, is 39 times further away than we think. 
We can check which intergalactic distances are correct, those of general 
relativity or those of space particle dualism. If the luminosities of 
supernovae drop with the square of the distance, then that indicates that the 
distances are probably accurate. If they don’t, then they are definitely not 
accurate. General relativity fails this test, while space particle dualism theory 
prevails.The Hubble evolution in space particle dualism is:  
 
𝐻= 
𝐻0− 𝐻𝑖
𝑡0
2
 𝑡2 + 𝐻𝑖  
 
The time-redshift equation of space particle dualism is:  

Sky Darmos 
12
𝑡 = ( 6 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0 −𝐻𝑖
 − 3)
(2 + 
6 𝐻𝑖
𝐻0 − 𝐻𝑖
)
⁄
 ≋ 3 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0
 
 
In these equations 𝐻0 is the current hubble value, and 𝐻𝑖 is the initial 
Hubble value at the beginning of time. 
The larger age of the universe also makes dark matter unnecessary. In a 
universe that is 42 trillion years old, naturally most of the interstellar gas has 
already been turned into stars that have already burned out and are invisible 
now. 
Another method of demonstrating that the universe is really 42 trillion 
years old was to calculate the age of all the white dwarfs in it. 35,000 white 
dwarfs were surveyed, and it turned out that 99% of them were older than 
the mainstream age of the universe. It also turned out that 99.3% of them 
were within the 42 trillion years that are predicted by space particle dualism. 
There were 214 exeptions, which can probably be fixed by accounting for 
mass shedding.
