Preface to the Sixth Edition
As the title suggests, this book is about fundamental things that one might
expect to remain fairly the same. Yet astronomy has evolved enormously over
the last few years, and only a few chapters of this book have been left unmod-
iﬁed.
Since the book is used also by many amateurs, the introductory chapter
has been extended to give a brief summary of different celestial objects to
“soften” the jump to rather technical topics.
The chapter on the solar system was very long. It has now been split into
two separate chapters. Chapter 7 deals with general properties of the solar
system. Individual objects are discussed in Chap. 8, which is more prone
to change when new data will accumulate. Also, new data on exoplanets is
obtained at an increasing rate. Therefore exoplanets are given a chapter of
their own; it is at the end of the book, since it is closely related to astrobiology,
already included in the previous edition. These last chapters may change more
than the rest of the book in the future.
These changes mean that the numbering of formulas and ﬁgures has
changed quite extensively after the previous version of the book.
Cosmology and galactic astronomy have still been evolving rapidly. There-
fore there are many revisions to the chapters on the Milky Way, galaxies, and
cosmology.
In addition, several other chapters contain smaller revisions and many of
the previous images have been replaced with newer ones.

Preface to the First Edition
The main purpose of this book is to serve as a university textbook for a ﬁrst
course in astronomy. However, we believe that the audience will also include
many serious amateurs, who often ﬁnd the popular texts too trivial. The lack
of a good handbook for amateurs has become a problem lately, as more and
more people are buying personal computers and need exact, but comprehen-
sible, mathematical formalism for their programs. The reader of this book is
assumed to have only a standard high-school knowledge of mathematics and
physics (as they are taught in Finland); everything more advanced is usually
derived step by step from simple basic principles. The mathematical back-
ground needed includes plane trigonometry, basic differential and integral
calculus, and (only in the chapter dealing with celestial mechanics) some vec-
tor calculus. Some mathematical concepts the reader may not be familiar with
are brieﬂy explained in the appendices or can be understood by studying the
numerous exercises and examples. However, most of the book can be read
with very little knowledge of mathematics, and even if the reader skips the
mathematically more involved sections, (s)he should get a good overview of
the ﬁeld of astronomy.
This book has evolved in the course of many years and through the work
of several authors and editors. The ﬁrst version consisted of lecture notes by
one of the editors (Oja). These were later modiﬁed and augmented by the
other editors and authors. Hannu Karttunen wrote the chapters on spherical
astronomy and celestial mechanics; Vilppu Piirola added parts to the chapter
on observational instruments, and Göran Sandell wrote the part about radio
astronomy; chapters on magnitudes, radiation mechanisms and temperature
were rewritten by the editors; Markku Poutanen wrote the chapter on the so-
lar system; Juhani Kyröläinen expanded the chapter on stellar spectra; Timo
Rahunen rewrote most of the chapters on stellar structure and evolution; Ilkka
Tuominen revised the chapter on the Sun; Kalevi Mattila wrote the chapter
on interstellar matter; Tapio Markkanen wrote the chapters on star clusters
and the Milky Way; Karl Johan Donner wrote the major part of the chap-
ter on galaxies; Mauri Valtonen wrote parts of the galaxy chapter, and, in
collaboration with Pekka Teerikorpi, the chapter on cosmology. Finally, the
resulting, somewhat inhomogeneous, material was made consistent by the
editors.
The English text was written by the editors, who translated parts of the
original Finnish text, and rewrote other parts, updating the text and correcting

errors found in the original edition. The parts of text set in smaller print are
less important material that may still be of interest to the reader.
For the illustrations, we received help from Veikko Sinkkonen, Mirva
Vuori and several observatories and individuals mentioned in the ﬁgure cap-
tions. In the practical work, we were assisted by Arja Kyröläinen and Merja
Karsma. A part of the translation was read and corrected by Brian Skiff. We
want to express our warmest thanks to all of them.
Financial support was given by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Suo-
malaisen kirjallisuuden edistämisvarojen valtuuskunta (a foundation promot-
ing Finnish literature), to whom we express our gratitude.

Introduction
On a dark, cloudless night, at a distant location
far away from the city lights, the starry sky can
be seen in all its splendour (Fig. 1.1). It is easy to
understand how these thousands of lights in the
sky have affected people throughout the ages.
As long as human beings have existed, they
have certainly wondered the sky. In the sky,
ancient people saw ﬁgures related to religious
myths and omens sent by the gods. However,
already a couple of millennia ago the real as-
tronomy started to evolve, separating itself from
religions and astrological superstitions. People
started to study the sky for its own sake.
1.1
Celestial Objects
In the 17th century people started to realise that
the Earth is not the centre of the Universe. About
the same time emerged the current view that stars
are celestial bodies similar to our Sun. The seem
to be faint dots only due to their huge distances.
We now know that the Sun and stars are hot glow-
ing balls of gas, producing energy when fusion
reactions convert hydrogen to helium and also to
other heavier elements (Chap. 11).
Although stars actually move at enormous
speeds, the sky does not seem to change even
in thousands of years, due to the vast distances
of the stars. In addition to the Sun and the Moon
there are some other objects that move with re-
spect to the stars. Since the antiquity, these mov-
ing objects have been called planets, from the
Greek word meaning a wanderer.
The rapid motions of the planets reveal that
they are much closer than the stars. Indeed they
are objects orbiting the Sun. According the cur-
rent deﬁnition (Chap. 7) there are eight planets
orbiting the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In addition
to these relatively big bodies a lot of different
smaller objects move around the Sun: dwarf plan-
ets, asteroids, comets and meteoroids (Chap. 8).
Mosts planets also have their own satellites or
moons. Planets, moons and minor bodies do not
produce light by nuclear fusion; instead they
shine just by reﬂecting the sunlight.
At the centre of the solar system shines the
Sun, producing energy by fusion reactions
(Chap. 13). It is the nearest star, and studying its
properties reveals also a lot about other stars.
A few thousand stars can be seen by the naked
eye, but even a small telescope reveals millions
of them. Based on their properties, stars can be
divided into different categories. A great major-
ity of them is main-sequence stars, like our Sun.
Some of them, though, are much bigger, giants
or supergiants, and some are much smaller, white
dwarfs. Different stars are usually related to dif-
ferent evolutionary stages in the lives of stars.
Many stars are variable stars, whose brightness
varies with time.
Rather recently found objects are compact
stars: neutron stars and black holes (Chap. 15).
Their material is squeezed into such a com-
pressed form and their gravitational ﬁeld is so
strong that Einstein’s general theory of relativity
must be used to describe their matter and space
around them.

Introduction
Fig. 1.1 The starry sky in
all its splendour can be
seen only far away from
the light pollution of cities.
(Pekka Parviainen)
Fig. 1.2 The Pleiades is
one of the best-known open
star clusters. The six
brightest stars can easily be
seen with the naked eye.
Photographs reveal also
interstellar gas reﬂecting
the light of the stars.
(NASA, ESA,
AURA/Caltech, Palomar
Observatory)
The Sun is a solitary star. Many stars appear in
pairs, they are binary stars, orbiting around their
common centre of mass (Chap. 10). Also systems
of several stars are relatively common.
Bigger groups of stars are star clusters
(Chap. 17). Open clusters (Fig. 1.2) usually con-
tain a few tens or hundreds of stars, that were born
in the same area, usually quite recently. Eventu-
ally the stars will diverge to their own paths.
Globular cluster (Fig. 1.3), on the other hand,
may contain hundreds of thousands or millions of
stars, which are usually very old.
The interstellar space corresponds pretty well
to our idea about a perfect vacuum. However, it
is not totally empty but contains interstellar mat-
ter, mainly hydrogen and helium, but also minute
amounts of heavier elements, molecules and dust
(Chap. 16). The interstellar medium does not
ﬁll the space as a uniform mist, but forms huge
clouds (Fig. 1.4).
New stars are born by condensing from the in-
terstellar matter. When the density, pressure and
temperature of the condensing cloud have risen
high enough, fusion reactions start and a new star

cluster M13 in the

begins to radiate the energy released in the re-
actions (Chap. 12). After millions or billions of
years the energy resources will be exhausted. The
evolution then depends on the mass of the star.
The smallest stars just cool down and fade away,
but more massive ones either eject part of their
mass back to space as planetary nebula or ex-
plode as supernovas. Thus matter converted by
the nuclear reactions of the stars is mixed with
the interstellar matter.
All stars visible as separate objects to the
naked eye or with binoculars belong to the Milky
Way (Fig. 1.5, Chap. 18). The Milky Way is a
system containing a couple of billion stars, a
galaxy (Figs. 1.6 and 1.7, Chap. 19). It takes
about 100,000 years to travel across the Milky
Way with the speed of light.
Milky Way is not the only galaxy, but just
one of very many similar systems. Galaxies are
the basic building blocks of the Universe. They
do not spread out evenly but form small galaxy
groups, bigger galaxy clusters and even bigger
superclusters.
Galaxies are observed close to the edge of the
visible universe. Nuclei of some galaxies are seen
as quasars; the most distant of them have radiated
the light we detect now when the age of the Uni-
verse was only one tenth of the current value.
1.2
The Role of Astronomy
Already a long time ago man was interested in
celestial phenomena. Several bone carvings made
by the Cro-Magnon men as early as 30,000 years
ago have been found, possibly recording Lunar
phases. In that case these calendars would be
the oldest astronomical documents, predating the
skill of writing by some 25,000 years.
Agriculture required a good knowledge of
the seasons. Religious rituals and prognostica-
tion were based on the locations of the celestial
bodies. Thus time reckoning became more and
more accurate, and people learned to calculate
the movements of celestial bodies in advance.
During the rapid development of seafaring,
when voyages extended farther and farther from
home ports, position determination presented
a problem for which astronomy offered a prac-
tical solution. Solving these problems of navi-
gation were the most important tasks of astron-
omy in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the ﬁrst
precise tables on the movements of the planets
and on other celestial phenomena were published.
The basis for these developments was the discov-
ery of the laws governing the motions of the plan-
ets by Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galilei
and Newton.

Introduction
Fig. 1.4 The North America nebula in the constellation
of Cygnus is a large cloud of interstellar gas. The nebula
appears brighter than the background because the radia-
tion from the nearby stars makes it shine. The nebula is,
however, very faint and difﬁcult to observe visually. The
brightest star on the right is α Cygni or Deneb. (Photo
M. Poutanen and H. Virtanen)
Astronomical research has changed man’s
view of the world from geocentric, anthropocen-
tric conceptions to the modern view of a vast uni-
verse where man and the Earth play an insigniﬁ-
cant role. Astronomy has taught us the real scale
of the nature surrounding us.
Modern astronomy is fundamental science,
motivated mainly by man’s curiosity, his wish to
know more about Nature and the Universe. As-
tronomy has a central role in forming a scien-
tiﬁc view of the world. “A scientiﬁc view of the
world” means a model of the universe based on
observations, thoroughly tested theories and log-
ical reasoning. Observations are always the ulti-
mate test of a model: if the model does not ﬁt
the observations, it has to be changed, and this
process must not be limited by any philosophical,
political or religious conceptions or beliefs.
1.3
Astronomical Objects of
Research
Modern astronomy explores the whole Universe
and its different forms of matter and energy. As-
tronomy can be divided into different branches in
several ways, based e.g. on the object of research
or the method used.
The Earth (Fig. 1.10) is of interest to astron-
omy for many reasons. Nearly all observations
must be made through the atmosphere (Fig. 1.9),
and the phenomena of the upper atmosphere and
magnetosphere reﬂect the state of interplanetary

Fig. 1.5 The Milky Way
appears as a nebulous band
stretching across the sky.
A telescope reveals that it
consists of myriads of stars
as observed already by
Galileo Galilei 400 years
ago. The Milky Way is a
ﬂat disclike stellar system.
Our solar system is close to
the plane of the disc, and
looking in the direction of
the plane we see a lot of
stars. But if we look away
from the disc the stellar
density is much lower. The
disc contains also unevenly
distributed interstellar gas
and dust, which obscures
the view in some
directions. Near the lower
edge of the picture the
Milky Way seems to split
into two branches because
the distant stars are behind
the intervening obscuring
matter. (Pekka Parviainen)
space. The Earth is also the most important ob-
ject of comparison for planetologists.
The Moon is still studied by astronomical
methods, although spacecraft and astronauts have
visited its surface and brought samples back to
the Earth. To amateur astronomers, the Moon
is an easy and interesting object for observa-
tions.
Space probes have already studied all plan-
ets, many of their satellites, some asteroids and
comets. The most distant planets, Uranus and
Neptune, have been observed only by ﬂy-bys, but
all the other ones also by orbiters. Spacecraft have
softlanded on Mars, Venus, Saturn’s moon Ti-
tan and some minor bodies. Exploration by such
probes has tremendously added to our knowledge
about the conditions of these objects. Continuous
monitoring of the planets, however, can still only
be made from the Earth, and many small bodies
of the solar system still await their spacecraft.

Introduction
Fig. 1.6 The galaxy M31
in the Andromeda
constellation is a star
system resembling our own
Milky Way. Stars and
interstellar matter
concentrate in spiral arms.
The shape of M31 is a
round, ﬂat disc, but due to
the oblique view it looks
oval. In good conditions
the centre of the galaxy can
be seen even with the
naked eye as a faint
nebulous spot. M31 has
two small elliptic
neighbour galaxies seen
here as bright ellipses. M32
is below the centre of M31
and M110 towards
northeast from the centre.
North is up. The dots are
stars of the Milky Way.
(Bill Schoening, Vanessa
Harvey/REU pro-
gram/NOAO/AURA/NSF)
Fig. 1.7 In addition to the
big galaxies like the Milky
Way there are numerous
much smaller dwarf
galaxies, which are often
irregular in shape. One of
them is the Large
Magellanic Cloud, our
nearest neighbour galaxy.
It is easily seen with the
naked eye, but it is close to
the southern pole of the
sky. (NOAO/Cerro Tololo

Fig. 1.8 The deep-ﬁeld
picture of the Hubble space
telescope is a combination
of several images exposed
altogether over 11 days.
The picture shows several
galaxies that are the most
distant ones known. When
we are looking far to space
we are also looking far to
the past since the light
proceeds at a ﬁnite speed.
Thus many of the galaxies
in the picture are also
among the oldest known
objects. When we compare
them with the objects in
our neighbourhood we can
deduce how the galaxies
evolved during billions of
years. (NASA)
Fig. 1.9 Although space
probes and satellites have
gathered remarkable new
information, a great
majority of astronomical
observations is still
Earth-based. The most
important observatories are
usually located at high
altitudes far from densely
populated areas. One such
observatory is on Mt
Paranal in Chile, which
houses the European VLT
telescopes. (Photo ESO)
An astronomer can also specialise in study-
ing several different ﬁelds like the Sun, differ-
ent kinds of stars, star clusters, the Milky Way
or galaxies (Fig. 1.11).
The largest object of research is the whole
Universe. Earlier this ﬁeld, cosmology, belonged
to theologists and philosophers, but in the 20th
century it became an object of physical theories

Introduction
and eventually of concrete astronomical observa-
tions.
Spherical astronomy is an old ﬁeld of astron-
omy studying the coordinate systems of the ce-
lestial sphere and apparent positions and motions
of the celestial objects. Until the 17th century as-
tronomy was mainly spherical astronomy.
When Isaac Newton published the fundamen-
tal laws of mechanics in 1687 in his Principia
mathematica, the motions of celestial objects got
a physical explanation. That was the beginning
of celestial mechanics, studying the motions from
the planets of the Solar System and satellites or-
biting the Earth to distant galaxies and galaxy
clusters.
Halfway the 19th century it was found out how
spectra can reveal physical properties of celestial
objects. This was the beginning of astrophysics,
studying the physical phenomena of the stars. Re-
sults from astrophysics are utilised particularly in
the research of the Sun, stars and interstellar mat-
ter.
Astronomy can be divided into different bran-
ches also by the wavelengths used. We can talk
about radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray or
gamma-ray astronomy, depending on the wave-
length used in the observations.
Astronomers study also particles coming from
the space, like neutrinos and cosmic rays. Grav-

Thanks to spaceﬂights we
have seen clearly the
planetary status of the
Earth. The picture was
taken by the Japanese
Kaguya lunar orbiter in
2007. Currently the Moon

outside the Earth visited by
human beings, on the
Apollo ﬂights in
1969–1972. (JAXA)
Fig. 1.11 Astronomy in the change. Although the num-
bers of astronomical articles have increased in all sub-
ﬁelds in the last few decades, the relative proportions have
changed. Cosmology and galaxies are the greatest winners
whereas the share of stellar research has decreased. The
graph illustrates the relative numbers of articles in differ-
ent ﬁelds of astronomy in the most inﬂuential journals in
1981–2009. (Adapted from the New Worlds, New Hori-
zons in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 2010, p. 120.) Pub-

Astronomy and space research may seem
to be related, although they are quite differ-
ent things. Space research includes all activi-
ties in the space, but only a minor fraction of
that is astronomical research. Space research is
mainly commercial services, like communica-
tion, weather observations, navigation, remote
sensing and environmental control, and also mil-

itary reconnaissance. Space astronomy is a ﬁeld
of astronomy that utilises observations made by
satellites and space probes.
1.4
The Scale of the Universe
The masses and sizes of astronomical objects
are usually enormously large. But to understand
their properties, the smallest parts of matter,
molecules, atoms and elementary particles, must
be studied. The densities, temperatures and mag-
netic ﬁelds in the Universe vary within much
larger limits than can be reached in laboratories
on the Earth (Fig. 1.12).
The greatest natural density met on the Earth is
22,500 kgm−3 (osmium), while in neutron stars
densities of the order of 1018 kgm−3 are possi-
ble. The density in the best vacuum achieved on
the Earth is only 10−9 kgm−3, but in interstellar
space the density of the gas may be 10−21 kgm−3
or even less. Modern accelerators can give parti-
cles energies of the order of 1013 electron volts
(eV). Cosmic rays coming from the sky may have
energies of over 1020 eV.
It has taken man a long time to grasp the vast
dimensions of space. Already Hipparchos in the
second century B.C. obtained a reasonably cor-
rect value for the distance of the Moon. The scale
of the solar system was established together with
the heliocentric system in the 17th century. In
the old geocentric system the distances of planets
did not affect their apparent motions and could
be chosen arbitrarily. In the heliocentric system
this is no more possible. Thus the distances of
the Solar System were known reasonably well as
early as in the 15th century. Also serious attempts
to determine stellar distances were made, but the
ﬁrst successful measurements were made only in
the 1830’s, and decent estimates for the distances
to the galaxies were obtained only in the 1920’s.
We can get some kind of picture of the dis-
tances involved (Fig. 1.4) by considering the time
required for light to travel from a source to the
retina of the human eye. It takes 8 minutes for
light to travel from the Sun, 5 1
2 hours from Nep-
tune and 4 years from the nearest star. We can-
not see the centre of the Milky Way, but the
many globular clusters around the Milky Way
are at approximately similar distances. It takes
about 20,000 years for the light from the glob-
ular cluster of Fig. 1.5 to reach the Earth. It
takes 150,000 years to travel the distance from
the nearest galaxy, the Magellanic Cloud seen on
the southern sky (Fig. 1.7). The photons that we
see now started their voyage when Neanderthal
Man lived on the Earth. The light coming from
the Andromeda Galaxy (Fig. 1.6) in the north-
ern sky originated 2 million years ago. Around
the same time the ﬁrst actual human using tools,
Homo habilis, appeared. The most distant objects
known, the quasars, are so far away that their ra-
diation, seen on the Earth now, was emitted long
before the Sun or the Earth were born (Fig. 1.8).

Spherical Astronomy
Spherical astronomy is a science studying astro-
nomical coordinate frames, directions and appar-
ent motions of celestial objects, determination of
position from astronomical observations, obser-
vational errors, etc. We shall concentrate mainly
on astronomical coordinates, apparent motions of
stars and time reckoning. Also, some of the most
important star catalogues will be introduced.
For simplicity we will assume that the ob-
server is always on the northern hemisphere. Al-
though all deﬁnitions and equations are easily
generalised for both hemispheres, this might be
unnecessarily confusing. In spherical astronomy
all angles are usually expressed in degrees; we
will also use degrees unless otherwise mentioned.
2.1
Spherical Trigonometry
For the coordinate transformations of spherical
astronomy, we need some mathematical tools,
which we present now.
If a plane passes through the centre of a sphere,
it will split the sphere into two identical hemi-
spheres along a circle called a great circle
(Fig. 2.1). A line perpendicular to the plane and
passing through the centre of the sphere inter-
sects the sphere at the poles P and P ′. If a sphere
is intersected by a plane not containing the cen-
tre, the intersection curve is a small circle. There
is exactly one great circle passing through two
given points Q and Q′ on a sphere (unless these
points are antipodal, in which case all circles
passing through both of them are great circles).
The arc QQ′ of this great circle is the shortest
Fig. 2.1 A great circle is the intersection of a sphere and
a plane passing through its centre. P and P ′ are the poles
of the great circle. The shortest path from Q to Q′ follows
the great circle
path on the surface of the sphere between these
points.
A spherical triangle is not just any three-
cornered ﬁgure lying on a sphere; its sides must
be arcs of great circles. The spherical trian-
gle ABC in Fig. 2.2 has the arcs AB, BC and AC
as its sides. If the radius of the sphere is r, the
length of the arc AB is
|AB| = rc,
[c] = rad,
where c is the angle subtended by the arc AB
as seen from the centre. This angle is called the
central angle of the side AB. Because lengths of
sides and central angles correspond to each other
in a unique way, it is customary to give the central
angles instead of the sides. In this way, the radius

of the sphere does not enter into the equations
of spherical trigonometry. An angle of a spheri-
cal triangle can be deﬁned as the angle between
the tangents of the two sides meeting at a vertex,
or as the dihedral angle between the planes in-
tersecting the sphere along these two sides. We
denote the angles of a spherical triangle by cap-
ital letters (A, B, C) and the opposing sides, or,
more correctly, the corresponding central angles,
by lowercase letters (a, b, c).
The sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is
always greater than 180 degrees; the excess
E = A + B + C −180◦
(2.1)
is called the spherical excess. It is not a constant,
but depends on the triangle. Unlike in plane ge-
ometry, it is not enough to know two of the angles
to determine the third one. The area of a spherical
triangle is related to the spherical excess in a very
simple way:
Area = Er2,
[E] = rad.
(2.2)
This shows that the spherical excess equals the
solid angle in steradians (see Appendix A.1), sub-
tended by the triangle as seen from the centre.
To prove (2.2), we extend all sides of the tri-
angle  to great circles (Fig. 2.3). These great
circles will form another triangle ′, congruent
with  but antipodal to it. If the angle A is ex-
pressed in radians, the area of the slice S(A)
Fig. 2.2 A spherical triangle is bounded by three arcs of
great circles, AB, BC and CA. The corresponding central
angles are c, a, and b
bounded by the two sides of A (the shaded
area in Fig. 2.3) is obviously 2A/2π = A/π
times the area of the sphere, 4πr2. Similarly, the
slices S(B) and S(C) cover fractions B/π and
C/π of the whole sphere.
Together, the three slices cover the whole sur-
face of the sphere, the equal triangles  and ′
belonging to every slice, and each point outside
the triangles, to exactly one slice. Thus the area of
the slices S(A), S(B) and S(C) equals the area of
the sphere plus four times the area of , A():
A + B + C
π
4πr2 = 4πr2 + 4A(),
whence
A() = (A + B + C −π)r2 = Er2.
As in the case of plane triangles, we can de-
rive relationships between the sides and angles of
spherical triangles. The easiest way to do this is
by inspecting certain coordinate transformations.
Suppose we have two rectangular coordinate
frames Oxyz and Ox′y′z′ (Fig. 2.4), such that
the x′y′z′ frame is obtained from the xyz frame
by rotating it around the x axis by an angle χ.
The position of a point P on a unit sphere is
uniquely determined by giving two angles. The
angle ψ is measured counterclockwise from the
positive x axis along the xy plane; the other an-
gle θ tells the angular distance from the xy plane.
Fig. 2.3 If the sides of a spherical triangle are extended
all the way around the sphere, they form another trian-
gle ′, antipodal and equal to the original triangle . The
shaded area is the slice S(A)

Fig. 2.4 The location of a point P on the surface of a unit
sphere can be expressed by rectangular xyz coordinates or
by two angles, ψ and θ. The x′y′z′ frame is obtained by
rotating the xyz frame around its x axis by an angle χ
In an analogous way, we can deﬁne the angles ψ′
and θ′, which give the position of the point P in
the x′y′z′ frame. The rectangular coordinates of
the point P as functions of these angles are:
x = cosψ cosθ,
x′ = cosψ′ cosθ′,
y = sinψ cosθ,
y′ = sinψ′ cosθ′,
z = sinθ,
z′ = sinθ′.
(2.3)
We also know that the dashed coordinates are ob-
tained from the undashed ones by a rotation in the
yz plane (Fig. 2.5):
x′ = x,
y′ = y cosχ + zsinχ,
(2.4)
z′ = −y sinχ + zcosχ.
By substituting the expressions of the rectangular
coordinates (2.3) into (2.4), we have
cosψ′ cosθ′ = cosψ cosθ,
sinψ′ cosθ′ = sinψ cosθ cosχ + sinθ sinχ,
sinθ′ = −sinψ cosθ sinχ + sinθ cosχ.
(2.5)
In fact, these equations are quite sufﬁcient for
all coordinate transformations we may encounter.
Fig. 2.5 The coordinates of the point P in the rotated
frame are x′ = x, y′ = y cosχ + zsinχ, z′ = zcosχ −
y sinχ
Fig. 2.6 To derive triangulation formulas for the spher-
ical triangle ABC, the spherical coordinates ψ, θ, ψ′
and θ′ of the vertex C are expressed in terms of the sides
and angles of the triangle
However, we shall also derive the usual equations
for spherical triangles. To do this, we set up the
coordinate frames in a suitable way (Fig. 2.6).
The z axis points towards the vertex A and the
z′ axis, towards B. Now the vertex C corresponds
to the point P in Fig. 2.4. The angles ψ, θ, ψ′, θ′
and χ can be expressed in terms of the angles and
sides of the spherical triangle:
ψ = A −90◦,
θ = 90◦−b,
ψ′ = 90◦−B,
θ′ = 90◦−a,
χ = c.
(2.6)

Spherical Astronomy
Substitution into (2.5) gives
cos(90◦−B)cos(90◦−a)
= cos(A −90◦)cos(90◦−b),
sin(90◦−B)cos(90◦−a)
= sin(A −90◦)cos(90◦−b)cosc
+ sin(90◦−b)sinc,
sin(90◦−a)
= −sin(A −90◦)cos(90◦−b)sinc
+ sin(90◦−b)cosc,
or
sinB sina = sinAsinb,
cosB sina = −cosAsinb cosc + cosb sinc,
cosa = cosAsinb sinc + cosb cosc.
(2.7)
Equations for other sides and angles are obtained
by cyclic permutations of the sides a, b, c and the
angles A, B, C. For instance, the ﬁrst equation
also yields
sinC sinb = sinB sinc,
sinAsinc = sinC sina.
All these variations of the sine formula can be
written in an easily remembered form:
sina
sinA = sinb
sinB = sinc
sinC .
(2.8)
If we take the limit, letting the sides a, b
and c shrink to zero, the spherical triangle be-
comes a plane triangle. If all angles are expressed
in radians, we have approximately
sina ≈a,
cosa ≈1 −1
2a2.
Substituting these approximations into the sine
formula, we get the familiar sine formula of plane
geometry:
a
sinA =
b
sinB =
c
sinC .
The second equation in (2.7) is the sine-cosine
formula, and the corresponding plane formula is
a trivial one:
c = b cosA + a cosB.
This is obtained by substituting the approxima-
tions of sine and cosine into the sine-cosine for-
mula and ignoring all quadratic and higher-order
terms. In the same way we can use the third equa-
tion in (2.7), the cosine formula, to derive the pla-
nar cosine formula:
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cosA.
2.2
The Earth
A position on the Earth is usually given by two
spherical coordinates (although in some calcu-
lations rectangular or other coordinates may be
more convenient). If necessary, also a third coor-
dinate, e.g. the distance from the centre, can be
used.
The reference plane is the equatorial plane,
perpendicular to the rotation axis and intersecting
the surface of the Earth along the equator. Small
circles parallel to the equator are called paral-
lels of latitude. Semicircles from pole to pole
are meridians. The geographical longitude is the
angle between the meridian and the zero merid-
ian passing through Greenwich Observatory. We
shall use positive values for longitudes east of
Greenwich and negative values west of Green-
wich. Sign convention, however, varies, and neg-
ative longitudes are not used in maps; so it is usu-
ally better to say explicitly whether the longitude
is east or west of Greenwich.
The latitude is usually supposed to mean the
geographical latitude, which is the angle between
the plumb line and the equatorial plane. The lat-
itude is positive in the northern hemisphere and
negative in the southern one. The geographical
latitude can be determined by astronomical ob-
servations (Fig. 2.7): the altitude of the celestial
pole measured from the horizon equals the geo-
graphical latitude. (The celestial pole is the inter-
section of the rotation axis of the Earth and the
inﬁnitely distant celestial sphere; we shall return
to these concepts a little later.)

2.2
The Earth
15
Fig. 2.7 The latitude φ is obtained by measuring the alti-
tude of the celestial pole. The celestial pole can be imag-
ined as a point at an inﬁnite distance in the direction of the
Earth’s rotation axis
Because the Earth is rotating, it is slightly ﬂat-
tened. The exact shape is rather complicated, but
for most purposes it can by approximated by an
oblate spheroid, the short axis of which coincides
with the rotation axis (Sect. 7.6). In 1979 the
International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics
(IUGG) adopted the Geodetic Reference System
1980 (GRS-80), which is used when global ref-
erence frames ﬁxed to the Earth are deﬁned. The
GRS-80 reference ellipsoid has the following di-
mensions:
equatorial radius
a = 6,378,137 m,
polar radius
b = 6,356,752 m,
ﬂattening
f = (a −b)/a
= 1/298.25722210.
The shape deﬁned by the surface of the oceans,
called the geoid, differs from this spheroid at
most by about 100 m.
The angle between the equator and the nor-
mal to the ellipsoid approximating the true Earth
is called the geodetic latitude. Because the sur-
face of a liquid (like an ocean) is perpendicular
to the plumb line, the geodetic and geographical
latitudes are practically the same.
Fig. 2.8 Due to the ﬂattening of the Earth, the geographic
latitude φ and geocentric latitude φ′ are different
Because of the ﬂattening, the plumb line does
not point to the centre of the Earth except at the
poles and on the equator. An angle corresponding
to the ordinary spherical coordinate (the angle be-
tween the equator and the line from the centre to
a point on the surface), the geocentric latitude φ′
is therefore a little smaller than the geographic
latitude φ (Fig. 2.8).
We now derive an equation between the geo-
graphic latitude φ and geocentric latitude φ′, as-
suming the Earth is an oblate spheroid and the
geographic and geodesic latitudes are equal. The
equation of the meridional ellipse is
x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1.
The direction of the normal to the ellipse at
a point (x,y) is given by
tanφ = −dx
dy = a2
b2
y
x .
The geocentric latitude is obtained from
tanφ′ = y/x.
Hence
tanφ′ = b2

is the eccentricity of the ellipse. The difference
φ = φ −φ′ has a maximum 11.5′ at the latitude
45◦.
Since the coordinates of celestial bodies in as-
tronomical almanacs are given with respect to the
centre of the Earth, the coordinates of nearby ob-
jects must be corrected for the difference in the
position of the observer, if high accuracy is re-
quired. This means that one has to calculate the
topocentric coordinates, centered at the observer.
The easiest way to do this is to use rectangular
coordinates of the object and the observer (Ex-
ample 2.6).
One arc minute along a meridian is called
a nautical mile. Since the radius of curvature
varies with latitude, increasing towards the poles,
the length of the nautical mile so deﬁned would
depend on the latitude (1843 m on the equator,
1862 m at the poles). Therefore one nautical mile
has been deﬁned to be equal to one minute of arc
at φ = 45◦, whence 1 nautical mile = 1852 m.
2.3
The Celestial Sphere
The ancient universe was conﬁned within a ﬁ-
nite spherical shell. The stars were ﬁxed to this
shell and thus were all equidistant from the Earth,
which was at the centre of the spherical universe.
This simple model is still in many ways as use-
ful as it was in antiquity: it helps us to easily un-
derstand the diurnal and annual motions of stars,
and, more important, to predict these motions in
a relatively simple way. Therefore we will assume
for the time being that all the stars are located on
the surface of an enormous sphere and that we
are at its centre. Because the radius of this celes-
tial sphere is practically inﬁnite, we can neglect
the effects due to the changing position of the ob-
server, caused by the rotation and orbital motion
of the Earth. These effects will be considered later
in Sects. 2.9 and 2.10.
Since the distances of the stars are ignored,
we need only two coordinates to specify their di-
rections. Each coordinate frame has some ﬁxed
reference plane passing through the centre of
Fig. 2.9 (a) The apparent motions of stars during a night
as seen from latitude φ = 45◦. (b) The same stars seen
from latitude φ = 10◦
the celestial sphere and dividing the sphere into
two hemispheres along a great circle. One of the
coordinates indicates the angular distance from
this reference plane. There is exactly one great
circle going through the object and intersecting
this plane perpendicularly; the second coordinate
gives the angle between that point of intersection
and some ﬁxed direction.
2.4
The Horizontal System
The most natural coordinate frame from the ob-
server’s point of view is the horizontal frame
(Fig. 2.9). Its reference plane is the tangent plane
of the Earth passing through the observer; this
horizontal plane intersects the celestial sphere
along the horizon. The point just above the ob-
server is called the zenith and the antipodal point
below the observer is the nadir. (These two points

2.5
The Equatorial System
17
are the poles corresponding to the horizon.) Great
circles through the zenith are called verticals. All
verticals intersect the horizon perpendicularly.
By observing the motion of a star over the
course of a night, an observer ﬁnds out that it fol-
lows a track like one of those in Fig. 2.9. Stars rise
in the east, reach their highest point, or culminate,
on the vertical NZS, and set in the west. The ver-
tical NZS is called the meridian. North and south
directions are deﬁned as the intersections of the
meridian and the horizon.
One of the horizontal coordinates is the alti-
tude or elevation, a, which is measured from the
horizon along the vertical passing through the ob-
ject. The altitude lies in the range [−90◦,+90◦];
it is positive for objects above the horizon and
negative for the objects below the horizon. The
zenith distance, or the angle between the object
and the zenith, is obviously
z = 90◦−a.
(2.10)
The second coordinate is the azimuth, A; it
is the angular distance of the vertical of the ob-
ject from some ﬁxed direction. Unfortunately,
in different contexts, different ﬁxed directions
are used; thus it is always advisable to check
which deﬁnition is employed. The azimuth is
usually measured from the north or south, and
though clockwise is the preferred direction, coun-
terclockwise measurements are also occasionally
used. In geography, navigation and many other
ﬁelds, the azimuth is measured from the north.
In this book we have adopted a fairly common
astronomical convention, measuring the azimuth
clockwise from the south. Its values are usually
normalised between 0◦and 360◦(or −180◦–
180◦). The reason for this deﬁnition is that some
other important angles are also measured from
the south.
In Fig. 2.9a we can see the altitude and az-
imuth of three stars at some instant. As a star
moves along its daily track, both of its coordi-
nates will change. Another difﬁculty with this co-
ordinate frame is its local character. In Fig. 2.9b
we have the same stars, but the observer is now
further south. We can see that the coordinates of
the same star at the same moment are different
for different observers. Since the horizontal co-
ordinates are time and position dependent, they
cannot be used, for instance, in star catalogues.
2.5
The Equatorial System
The direction of the rotation axis of the Earth re-
mains almost constant and so does the equato-
rial plane perpendicular to this axis. Therefore the
equatorial plane is a suitable reference plane for
a coordinate frame that has to be independent of
time and the position of the observer.
The intersection of the celestial sphere and
the equatorial plane is a great circle, which is
called the equator of the celestial sphere. The
north pole of the celestial sphere is one of the
poles corresponding to this great circle. It is also
the point in the northern sky where the exten-
sion of the Earth’s rotational axis meets the ce-
lestial sphere. The celestial north pole is at a dis-
tance of about one degree (which is equivalent to
two full moons) from the moderately bright star
Polaris. The meridian always passes through the
north pole; it is divided by the pole into north and
south meridians.
The angular separation of a star from the equa-
torial plane is not affected by the rotation of the
Earth. This angle is called the declination δ.
Stars seem to revolve around the pole once ev-
ery day (Fig. 2.10). To deﬁne the second coordi-
nate, we must again agree on a ﬁxed direction,
unaffected by the Earth’s rotation. From a mathe-
matical point of view, it does not matter which
point on the equator is selected. However, for
later purposes, it is more appropriate to employ
a certain point with some valuable properties,
which will be explained in the next section. This
point is called the vernal equinox. Because it used
to be in the constellation Aries (the Ram), it is
also called the ﬁrst point of Aries ant denoted
by the sign of Aries, Υ . Now we can deﬁne the
second coordinate as the angle from the vernal
equinox measured along the equator. This angle
is the right ascension α (or R.A.) of the object,
measured counterclockwise from Υ .
Since declination and right ascension are in-
dependent of the position of the observer and the

18
2
Spherical Astronomy
motions of the Earth, they can be used in star
maps and catalogues. As will be explained later,
in many telescopes one of the axes (the hour axis)
is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. The
other axis (declination axis) is perpendicular to
the hour axis. Declinations can be read imme-
diately on the declination dial of the telescope.
But the zero point of the right ascension seems
to move in the sky, due to the diurnal rotation of
the Earth. So we cannot use the right ascension to
ﬁnd an object unless we know the direction of the
vernal equinox.
Since the south meridian is a well-deﬁned line
in the sky, we use it to establish a local coordinate
corresponding to the right ascension. The hour
angle h is measured clockwise from the meridian.
The hour angle of an object is not a constant, but
grows at a steady rate, due to the Earth’s rotation.
The hour angle of the vernal equinox is called the

lestial pole. The altitude of the pole from the horizon
equals the latitude of the observer. (Photo Aimo Sillanpää
and Pasi Nurmi)
sidereal time Θ. Figure 2.11 shows that for any
object,
Θ = h + α,
(2.11)
where h is the object’s hour angle and α its right
ascension.
Since hour angle and sidereal time change
with time at a constant rate, it is practical to ex-
press them in units of time. Also the closely re-
lated right ascension is customarily given in time
units. Thus 24 hours equals 360 degrees, 1 hour =
15 degrees, 1 minute of time = 15 minutes of arc,
and so on. All these quantities are in the range
[0 h,24 h). This custom also explains the name
hour circle; it is a great circle along which the
hour angle (or right ascension) is constant.
In practice, the sidereal time can be readily de-
termined by pointing the telescope to an easily
recognisable star and reading its hour angle on
the hour angle dial of the telescope. The right as-
cension found in a catalogue is then added to the
hour angle, giving the sidereal time at the moment
of observation. For any other time, the sidereal
time can be evaluated by adding the time elapsed
since the observation. If we want to be accurate,
we have to use a sidereal clock to measure time
intervals. A sidereal clock runs 3 min 56.56 s fast
a day as compared with an ordinary solar time
Fig. 2.11 The relation between the right ascension α,
hour angle h and sidereal time Θ. The right ascension is
measured counterclockwise from the vernal equinox, the
hour angle and sidereal time clockwise from the South
meridian. The sidereal time is the hour angle the vernal
equinox

tions between the horizontal and equatorial frames

(2.12)
The reason for this is the orbital motion of the
Earth: stars seem to move faster than the Sun
across the sky; hence, a sidereal clock must run
faster. (This is further discussed in Sect. 2.13.)
Transformations between the horizontal and
equatorial frames are easily obtained from spher-
ical trigonometry. Comparing Figs. 2.6 and 2.12,
we ﬁnd that we must make the following substi-
tutions into (2.5):
ψ = 90◦−A,
θ = a,
ψ′ = 90◦−h,
θ′ = δ,
χ = 90◦−φ.
(2.13)
The angle φ in the last equation is the altitude of
the celestial pole, or the latitude of the observer.
Making the substitutions, we get
sinhcosδ = sinAcosa,
coshcosδ = cosAcosa sinφ + sina cosφ,
sinδ = −cosAcosa cosφ + sina sinφ.
(2.14)
The inverse transformation is obtained by sub-
stituting
ψ = 90◦−h,
θ = δ,
ψ′ = 90◦−A,
θ′ = a,
χ = −(90◦−φ),
(2.15)
whence
sinAcosa = sinhcosδ,
cosAcosa = coshcosδ sinφ −sinδ cosφ,
sina = coshcosδ cosφ + sinδ sinφ.
(2.16)
Since the altitude and declination are in the
range [−90◦,+90◦], it sufﬁces to know the sine
of one of these angles to determine the other an-
gle unambiguously. Azimuth and right ascension,
however, can have any value from 0◦to 360◦(or
from 0 h to 24 h), and to solve for them, we have
to know both the sine and cosine to choose the
correct quadrant.
The altitude of an object is greatest when it
is on the south meridian (the great circle arc be-
tween the celestial poles containing the zenith).
At that moment (called upper culmination, or
transit) its hour angle is 0 h. At the lower culmi-
nation the hour angle is h = 12 h. When h = 0 h,
we get from the last equation in (2.16)
sina = cosδ cosφ + sinδ sinφ
= cos(φ −δ) = sin(90◦−φ + δ).
Thus the altitude at the upper culmination is
amax =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
90◦−φ + δ,
if the object culminates
south of zenith,
90◦+ φ −δ,
if the object culminates
north of zenith.
(2.17)
The altitude is positive for objects with δ >
φ −90◦. Objects with declinations less than φ −
90◦can never be seen at the latitude φ. On the
other hand, when h = 12 h we have
sina = −cosδ cosφ + sinδ sinφ
= −cos(δ + φ) = sin(δ + φ −90◦),

20

Spherical Astronomy
and the altitude at the lower culmination is
amin = δ + φ −90◦.
(2.18)
Stars with δ > 90◦−φ will never set. For exam-
ple, in Helsinki (φ ≈60◦), all stars with a decli-
nation higher than 30◦are such circumpolar stars.
And stars with a declination less than −30◦can
never be observed there.
We shall now study brieﬂy how the (α,δ) fra-
me can be established by observations. Suppose
we observe a circumpolar star at its upper and
lower culmination (Fig. 2.13). At the upper tran-
sit, its altitude is amax = 90◦−φ + δ and at the
lower transit, amin = δ +φ −90◦. Eliminating the
latitude, we get
δ = 1
2(amin + amax).
(2.19)
Thus we get the same value for the declination,
independent of the observer’s location. Therefore
we can use it as one of the absolute coordinates.
From the same observations, we can also deter-
mine the direction of the celestial pole as well as
the latitude of the observer. After these prepara-
tions, we can ﬁnd the declination of any object by
measuring its distance from the pole.
The equator can be now deﬁned as the great
circle all of whose points are at a distance of 90◦
from the pole. The zero point of the second co-
ordinate (right ascension) can then be deﬁned as
the point where the Sun seems to cross the equa-
tor from south to north.
In practice the situation is more complicated,
since the direction of Earth’s rotation axis changes
Fig. 2.13 The altitude of a circumpolar star at upper and
lower culmination
due to perturbations. Therefore the equatorial co-
ordinate frame is nowadays deﬁned using cer-
tain standard objects the positions of which
are known very accurately. The best accuracy
is achieved by using the most distant objects,
quasars (Sect. 19.7), which remain in the same
direction over very long intervals of time.
2.6
Rising and Setting Times
From the last equation (2.16), we ﬁnd the hour
angle h of an object at the moment its altitude
is a:
cosh = −tanδ tanφ +
sina
cosδ cosφ .
(2.20)
This equation can be used for computing rising
and setting times. Then a = 0 and the hour an-
gles corresponding to rising and setting times are
obtained from
cosh = −tanδ tanφ.
(2.21)
If the right ascension α is known, we can use
(2.11) to compute the sidereal time Θ. (Later, in
Sect. 2.14, we shall study how to transform the
sidereal time to ordinary time.)
If higher accuracy is needed, we have to cor-
rect for the refraction of light caused by the at-
mosphere of the Earth (see Sect. 2.9). In that
case, we must use a small negative value for a
in (2.20). This value, the horizontal refraction, is
about −34′.
The rising and setting times of the Sun given
in almanacs refer to the time when the upper
edge of the Solar disk just touches the horizon.
To compute these times, we must set a = −50′
(= −34′ −16′).
Also for the Moon almanacs give rising and
setting times of the upper edge of the disk. Since
the distance of the Moon varies considerably, we
cannot use any constant value for the radius of the
Moon, but it has to be calculated separately each
time. The Moon is also so close that its direction
with respect to the background stars varies due to
the rotation of the Earth. Thus the rising and set-
ting times of the Moon are deﬁned as the instants
when the altitude of the Moon is −34′ −s + π,

The Ecliptic System

Fig. 2.14 The ecliptic or the apparent orbit of the Sun
resembles somewhat a sine curve in the equatorial coordi-
nate frame. The ecliptic passes through 13 constellations.
Since many of them have been named after animals, the
neighbourhood of the ecliptic is called the zodiac. As-
trologers divide the ecliptic into 12 equal signs of 30◦
each. (Ophiuchus is unknown to them.) Due to the preces-
sion of the coordinate frame the astrological signs and the
constellations with the same name are no more aligned.
Also the sizes of the actual constellations are quite differ-
ent
where s is the apparent radius (15.5′ on the aver-
age) and π the parallax (57′ on the average). The
latter quantity is explained in Sect. 2.9.
Finding the rising and setting times of the
Sun, planets and especially the Moon is compli-
cated by their motion with respect to the stars.
We can use, for example, the coordinates for the
noon to calculate estimates for the rising and set-
ting times, which can then be used to interpolate
more accurate coordinates for the rising and set-
ting times. When these coordinates are used to
compute new times a pretty good accuracy can
be obtained. The iteration can be repeated if even
higher precision is required.
2.7
The Ecliptic System
The orbital plane of the Earth, the ecliptic, is the
reference plane of another important coordinate
frame. The ecliptic can also be deﬁned as the
great circle on the celestial sphere described by
the Sun in the course of one year. This frame is
used mainly for planets and other bodies of the
solar system. The orientation of the Earth’s equa-
torial plane remains invariant, unaffected by an-
nual motion. In spring, the Sun appears to move
from the southern hemisphere to the northern one
(Fig. 2.14). The time of this remarkable event
as well as the direction to the Sun at that mo-
ment are called the vernal equinox. At the vernal
Fig. 2.15 The ecliptic geocentric (λ,β) and heliocentric
(λ′,β′) coordinates are equal only if the object is very
far away. The geocentric coordinates depend also on the
Earth’s position in its orbit
equinox, the Sun’s right ascension and declina-
tion are zero. The equatorial and ecliptic planes
intersect along a straight line directed towards the
vernal equinox. Thus we can use this direction as
the zero point for both the equatorial and ecliptic
coordinate frames. The point opposite the vernal
equinox is the autumnal equinox, it is the point at
which the Sun crosses the equator from north to
south.
The ecliptic latitude β is the angular distance
from the ecliptic; it is in the range [−90◦,+90◦].
The other coordinate is the ecliptic longitude λ,
measured counterclockwise from the vernal
equinox (Fig. 2.15).
Transformation equations between the equa-
torial and ecliptic frames can be derived analo-

22

gously to (2.14) and (2.16):
sinλcosβ = sinδ sinε + cosδ cosε sinα,
cosλcosβ = cosδ cosα,
(2.22)
sinβ = sinδ cosε −cosδ sinε sinα,
sinα cosδ = −sinβ sinε + cosβ cosε sinλ,
cosα cosδ = cosλcosβ,
(2.23)
sinδ = sinβ cosε + cosβ sinε sinλ.
The angle ε appearing in these equations is
the obliquity of the ecliptic, or the angle between
the equatorial and ecliptic planes. Its value is
roughly 23◦26′ (a more accurate value is given
in Box 2.1).
Depending on the problem to be solved, we
may encounter heliocentric (origin at the Sun),
geocentric (origin at the centre of the Earth) or
topocentric (origin at the observer) coordinates.
For very distant objects the differences are neg-
ligible, but not for bodies of the solar system.
To transform heliocentric coordinates to geocen-
tric coordinates or vice versa, we must also know
the distance of the object. This transformation is
most easily accomplished by computing the rect-
angular coordinates of the object and the new ori-
gin, then changing the origin and ﬁnally evaluat-
ing the new latitude and longitude from the rect-
angular coordinates (see Examples 2.5 and 2.6).
2.8
The Galactic Coordinates
For studies of the Milky Way Galaxy, the most
natural reference plane is the plane of the Milky
Way (Fig. 2.16). Since the Sun lies very close
to that plane, we can put the origin at the Sun.
The galactic longitude l is measured counter-
clockwise (like right ascension) from the direc-
tion of the centre of the Milky Way (in Sagit-
tarius, α = 17 h 45.7 min, δ = −29◦00′). The
Fig. 2.16 The galactic coordinates l and b
galactic latitude b is measured from the galac-
tic plane, positive northwards and negative south-
wards. This deﬁnition was ofﬁcially adopted only
in 1959, when the direction of the galactic cen-
tre was determined from radio observations ac-
curately enough. The old galactic coordinates lI
and bI had the intersection of the equator and the
galactic plane as their zero point.
The galactic coordinates can be obtained from
the equatorial ones with the transformation equa-
tions
sin(lN −l)cosb = cosδ sin(α −αP),
cos(lN −l)cosb = −cosδ sinδP cos(α −αP)
+ sinδ cosδP,
sinb = cosδ cosδP cos(α −αP)
+ sinδ sinδP,
(2.24)
where the direction of the Galactic north pole is
αP = 12 h 51.4 min, δP = 27◦08′, and the galactic
longitude of the celestial pole, lN = 123.0◦.
2.9
Perturbations of Coordinates
Even if a star remains ﬁxed with respect to the
Sun, its coordinates can change, due to several
disturbing effects. Naturally its altitude and az-
imuth change constantly because of the rotation
of the Earth, but even its right ascension and dec-
lination are not quite free from perturbations.
Precession
The Earth is not quite spherical but
slightly ﬂattened. Since most of the members of
the solar system orbit close to the ecliptic, they
tend to pull the equatorial bulge of the Earth
towards it. Most of this “ﬂattening” torque is
caused by the Moon and the Sun. But the Earth
is rotating and therefore the torque cannot change
the inclination of the equator relative to the eclip-
tic. Instead, the rotation axis turns in a direction
perpendicular to the axis and the torque, thus de-
scribing a cone once in roughly 26,000 years.
This slow turning of the rotation axis is called
precession (Fig. 2.17). Because of precession, the

Fig. 2.17 Due to
precession the celestial
pole moves and makes a
full revolution in about
26,000 years. For a while it
is still approaching Polaris,
but will then begin to
recede. In about 14,000 it
will be close to Vega.
Somewhat over 2000 years
BC the pole was close to
the α star of Drace, Thuban
vernal equinox moves along the ecliptic clock-
wise about 50 seconds of arc every year, thus in-
creasing the ecliptic longitudes of all objects at
the same rate. At present the rotation axis points
about one degree away from Polaris, but after
12,000 years, the celestial pole will be roughly in
the direction of Vega. The changing ecliptic lon-
gitudes also affect the right ascension and decli-
nation. Thus we have to know the instant of time,
or epoch, for which the coordinates are given.
Currently most maps and catalogues use the
epoch J2000.0, which means the beginning of
the year 2000, or, to be exact, the noon of Jan-
uary 1, 2000, or the Julian date 2,451,545.0 (see
Sect. 2.15).
Let us now derive expressions for the changes
in right ascension and declination. Taking the last
transformation equation in (2.23),
sinδ = cosε sinβ + sinε cosβ sinλ,
and differentiating, we get
cosδ dδ = sinε cosβ cosλdλ.
Applying the second equation in (2.22) to the
right-hand side, we have, for the change in dec-
lination,
dδ = dλsinε cosα.
(2.25)
By differentiating the equation
cosα cosδ = cosβ cosλ,
we get
−sinα cosδ dα −cosα sinδ dδ
= −cosβ sinλdλ;
and, by substituting the previously obtained ex-
pression for dδ and applying the ﬁrst equation
(2.22), we have
sinα cosδ dα
= dλ

cosβ sinλ −sinε cos2 α sinδ

= dλ

sinδ sinε + cosδ cosε sinα

.
Simplifying this, we get
dα = dλ(sinα sinε tanδ + cosε).
(2.26)
If dλ is the annual increment of the ecliptic lon-
gitude (about 50′′), the precessional changes in

dα = dλ(sinε sinα tanδ + cosε).

These expressions are usually written in the form
dδ = ncosα,
dα = m + nsinα tanδ,
(2.28)
where
m = dλcosε,
n = dλsinε
(2.29)
are the precession constants. Since the obliq-
uity of the ecliptic is not exactly a constant but
changes with time, m and n also vary slowly with
time. However, this variation is so slow that usu-
ally we can regard m and n as constants unless
the time interval is very long. The values of these
constants for some epochs are given in Table 2.1.
For intervals longer than a few decades a more
rigorous method should be used. Its derivation ex-
ceeds the level of this book, but the necessary for-
mulas are given in Box 2.1.
Nutation
The Moon’s orbit is inclined with re-
spect to the ecliptic, resulting in precession of
its orbital plane. One revolution takes 18.6 years,
producing perturbations with the same period in
the precession of the Earth. This effect, nutation,
changes ecliptic longitudes as well as the obliq-
uity of the ecliptic (Fig. 2.18). Calculations are
now much more complicated, but fortunately nu-
tational perturbations are relatively small, only
fractions of an arc minute. Thus they can often be
Fig. 2.18 Due to precession the rotation axis of the Earth
turns around the ecliptic north pole. Nutation is the small
wobble disturbing the smooth precessional motion. In this
ﬁgure the magnitude of the nutation is highly exaggerated
calculated using the simple formulas of Box 2.1
or just omitted.
Parallax
If we observe an object from different
points, we see it in different directions. The dif-
ference of the observed directions (as well as the
whole phenomenon) is called the parallax. Since
the amount of parallax depends on the distance
of the observer from the object, we can utilise
the parallax to measure distances. Human stereo-
scopic vision is based (at least to some extent)
on this effect. For astronomical purposes we need
much longer baselines than the distance between
our eyes (about 7 cm). Appropriately large and
convenient baselines are the radius of the Earth
and the radius of its orbit.
Distances to the nearest stars can be deter-
mined from the annual parallax, which is the an-
gle subtended by the radius of the Earth’s orbit
(called the astronomical unit, au) as seen from the
star. (We shall discuss this further in Sect. 2.10.)
By diurnal parallax we mean the change of
direction due to the daily rotation of the Earth. In
addition to the distance of the object, the diurnal
parallax also depends on the latitude of the ob-
server. If we talk about the parallax of a body in
our solar system, we always mean the angle sub-
tended by the Earth’s equatorial radius (6378 km)
as seen from the object (Fig. 2.19). This equals
the apparent shift of the object with respect to the
background stars seen by an observer at the equa-
tor if (s)he observes the object moving from the

horizon to the zenith. The parallax of the Moon,
for example, is about 57′, and that of the Sun
8.79′′.
In astronomy parallax may also refer to dis-
tance in general, even if it is not measured using
the shift in the observed direction.
Aberration
Because of the ﬁnite speed of light,
an observer in motion sees an object shifted in
the direction of her/his motion (Fig. 2.20). This
change of apparent direction is called the aber-
ration. To derive the exact value we have to use
the special theory of relativity, but for practical
purposes it sufﬁces to use the approximate value
a = v
c sinθ,
[a] = rad,
(2.30)
Fig. 2.21 A telescope is pointed in the true direction of
a star. It takes a time t = l/c for the light to travel the
length of the telescope. The telescope is moving with ve-
locity v, which has a component v sinθ, perpendicular to
the direction of the light beam. The beam will hit the bot-
tom of the telescope displaced from the optical axis by
a distance x = tv sinθ = l(v/c)sinθ. Thus the change of
direction in radians is a = x/l = (v/c)sinθ
where v is the velocity of the observer, c is the
speed of light and θ is the angle between the
true direction of the object and the velocity vector
of the observer (Fig 2.21). The greatest possible
value of the aberration due to the orbital motion
of the Earth, v/c, called the aberration constant,
is 21′′. The maximal shift due to the Earth’s ro-
tation, the diurnal aberration constant, is much
smaller, about 0.3′′.
Refraction
Since light is refracted by the at-
mosphere, the direction of an object differs from
the true direction by an amount depending on the
atmospheric conditions along the line of sight.
Since this refraction varies with atmospheric
pressure and temperature, it is very difﬁcult to
predict it accurately. However, an approximation
good enough for most practical purposes is eas-
ily derived. If the object is not too far from the
zenith, the atmosphere between the object and
the observer can be approximated by a stack of
parallel planar layers, each of which has a certain

26
2
Spherical Astronomy
index of refraction ni (Fig. 2.22). Outside the at-
mosphere, we have n = 1.
Let the true zenith distance be z and the appar-
ent one, ζ. Using the notations of Fig. 2.22, we
obtain the following equations for the boundaries
of the successive layers:
sinz = nk sinzk,
...
n2 sinz2 = n1 sinz1,
n1 sinz1 = n0 sinζ.
Simplifying this set of equations we get
sinz = n0 sinζ.
(2.31)
When the refraction angle R = z−ζ is small and
is expressed in radians, we have
n0 sinζ = sinz = sin(R + ζ)
= sinR cosζ + cosR sinζ
≈R cosζ + sinζ.
Thus we get
R = (n0 −1)tanζ,
[R] = rad.
(2.32)
The index of refraction depends on the density
of the air, which further depends on the pressure
Fig. 2.22 Refraction of a light ray travelling through the
atmosphere. If the altitude is not very low we can think
that the atmosphere consists of planar layers each of which
has its own index of refraction. Outside the atmosphere the
index is n = 1 and increases towards the ground
and temperature. When the altitude is over 15◦,
we can use an approximate formula
R =
P
273 + T 0.00452◦tan(90◦−a),
(2.33)
where a is the altitude in degrees, T tempera-
ture in degrees Celsius, and P the atmospheric
pressure in hectopascals (or, equivalently, in mil-
libars). At lower altitudes the curvature of the at-
mosphere must be taken into account. An approx-
imate formula for the refraction is then
R =
P
273 + T
0.1594 + 0.0196a + 0.00002a2
1 + 0.505a + 0.0845a2
.
(2.34)
These formulas are widely used, although they
are against the rules of dimensional analysis.
To get correct values, all quantities must be ex-
pressed in correct units. Figure 2.23 shows the
refraction under different conditions evaluated
from these formulas.
Altitude is always (except very close to zenith)
increased by refraction. On the horizon the change
is about 34′, which is slightly more than the di-
ameter of the Sun. When the lower limb of the
Sun just touches the horizon, the Sun has in real-
ity already set.
Light coming from the zenith is not refracted
at all if the boundaries between the layers are hor-
izontal. Under some climatic conditions, a bound-
ary (e.g. between cold and warm layers) can be
slanted, and in this case, there can be a small
Fig. 2.23 Refraction at different altitudes. The refraction
angle R tells how much higher the object seems to be com-
pared with its true altitude a. Refraction depends on the
density and thus on the pressure and temperature of the
air. The upper curves give the refraction at sea level dur-
ing rather extreme weather conditions. At the altitude of
2.5 kilometers the average pressure is only 700 hPa, and
thus the effect of refraction smaller (lowest curve)

zenith refraction, which is of the order of a few
arc seconds.
Stellar positions given in star catalogues are
mean places, from which the effects of parallax,
aberration and nutation have been removed. The
mean place of the date (i.e. at the observing time)
is obtained by correcting the mean place for the
proper motion of the star (Sect. 2.10) and preces-
sion. The apparent place is obtained by correct-
ing this place further for nutation, parallax and
aberration. There is a catalogue published annu-
ally that gives the apparent places of certain ref-
erences stars at intervals of a few days. These po-
sitions have been corrected for precession, nuta-
tion, parallax and annual aberration. The effects
of diurnal aberration and refraction are not in-
cluded because they depend on the location of the
observer.
2.10
Positional Astronomy
The position of a star can be measured either with
respect to some reference stars (relative astrome-
try) or with respect to a ﬁxed coordinate frame
(absolute astrometry).
Absolute coordinates are usually determined
using a meridian circle, which is a telescope
that can be turned only in the meridional plane
(Fig. 2.27). It has only one axis, which is aligned
exactly in the east-west direction. Since all stars
cross the meridian in the course of a day, they all
come to the ﬁeld of the meridian circle at some
time or other. When a star culminates, its altitude
and the time of the transit are recorded. If the time
is determined with a sidereal clock, the sidereal
time immediately gives the right ascension of the
star, since the hour angle is h = 0 h. The other
coordinate, the declination δ, is obtained from the
altitude:
δ = a −(90◦−φ),
where a is the observed altitude and φ is the geo-
graphic latitude of the observatory.
Relative coordinates are measured on photo-
graphic plates (Fig. 2.25) or CCD images con-
taining some known reference stars. The scale of
the plate as well as the orientation of the coordi-
Fig. 2.24 The trigonometric parallax π of a star S is the
angle subtended by the radius of the orbit of the Earth, or
one astronomical unit, as seen from the star
nate frame can be determined from the reference
stars. After this has been done, the right ascen-
sion and declination of any object in the image
can be calculated if its coordinates in the image
are measured.
All stars in a small ﬁeld are almost equally af-
fected by the dominant perturbations, precession,
nutation, and aberration. The much smaller effect
of parallax, on the other hand, changes the rela-
tive positions of the stars.
The shift in the direction of a star with respect
to distant background stars due to the annual mo-
tion of the Earth is called the trigonometric par-
allax of the star. It gives the distance of the star:
the smaller the parallax, the farther away the star
is. Trigonometric parallax is, in fact, the only di-
rect method we currently have of measuring dis-
tances to stars. Later we shall be introduced to
some other, indirect methods, which require cer-
tain assumptions on the motions or structure of
stars. The same method of triangulation is em-
ployed to measure distances of earthly objects.
To measure distances to stars, we have to use the
longest baseline available, the diameter of the or-
bit of the Earth.
During the course of one year, a star will ap-
pear to describe a circle if it is at the pole of the
ecliptic, a segment of line if it is in the ecliptic, or
an ellipse otherwise. The semimajor axis of this
ellipse is called the parallax of the star. It is usu-
ally denoted by π. It equals the angle subtended
by the radius of the Earth’s orbit as seen from the
star (Fig. 2.24).

Spherical Astronomy
The unit of distance used in astronomy is par-
sec (pc). At a distance of one parsec, one astro-
nomical unit subtends an angle of one arc sec-
ond. Since one radian is about 206,265′′, 1 pc
equals 206,265 au. Furthermore, because 1 au =
1.496 × 1011 m, 1 pc ≈3.086 × 1016 m. If the
parallax is given in arc seconds, the distance is
simply
r = 1/π,
[r] = pc,
[π] = ′′.
(2.35)
In popular astronomical texts, distances are
usually given in light-years, one light-year be-
ing the distance light travels in one year, or 9.5 ×
1015 m. Thus one parsec is about 3.26 light-years.
The ﬁrst parallax measurement was accom-
plished by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784–1846)
in 1838. He found the parallax of 61 Cygni to be
0.3′′. The nearest star Proxima Centauri has a par-
allax of 0.762′′ and thus a distance of 1.31 pc.
In addition to the motion due to the annual par-
allax, many stars seem to move slowly in a direc-
tion that does not change with time. This effect is
caused by the relative motion of the Sun and the
stars through space; it is called the proper motion.
The appearance of the sky and the shapes of the
constellations are constantly, although extremely
slowly, changed by the proper motions of the stars
(Fig. 2.26).
The velocity of a star with respect to the Sun
can be divided into two components (Fig. 2.28),
one of which is directed along the line of sight
(the radial component or the radial velocity), and
the other perpendicular to it (the tangential com-
ponent). The tangential velocity results in the
proper motion, which can be measured by taking
pictures at intervals of several years or decades.
The proper motion μ has two components, one
giving the change in declination μδ and the other,
in right ascension, μα cosδ. The coefﬁcient cosδ
is used to correct the scale of right ascension:
hour circles (the great circles with α = constant)
approach each other towards the poles, so the co-
ordinate difference must be multiplied by cosδ
to obtain the true angular separation. The total
proper motion is
μ =

μ2α cos2 δ + μ2
δ.
(2.36)
The greatest known proper motion belongs to
Barnard’s Star, which moves across the sky at the
enormous speed of 10.3 arc seconds per year. It
needs less than 200 years to travel the diameter
of a full moon.
In order to measure proper motions, we must
observe stars for a long time. The radial compo-
nent, on the other hand, is readily obtained from
a single observation, thanks to the Doppler effect.
By the Doppler effect we mean the change in fre-
quency and wavelength of radiation due to the ra-
dial velocity of the radiation source. The same ef-
fect can be observed, for example, in the sound
of an ambulance, the pitch being higher when the
ambulance is approaching and lower when it is
receding.
The formula for the Doppler effect for small
velocities can be derived as in Fig. 2.29. The
source of radiation transmits electromagnetic
waves, the period of one cycle being T . In time T ,
the radiation approaches the observer by a dis-
tance s = cT , where c is the speed of propa-
gation. During the same time, the source moves
with respect to the observer a distance s′ = vT ,
where v is the speed of the source, positive for
a receding source and negative for an approach-
ing one. We ﬁnd that the length of one cycle, the
wavelength λ, equals
λ = s + s′ = cT + vT.
If the source were at rest, the wavelength of its
radiation would be λ0 = cT . The motion of the
source changes the wavelength by an amount
λ = λ −λ0 = cT + vT −cT = vT,
and the relative change λ of the wavelength is
λ
λ0
= v
c .
(2.37)
This is valid only when v ≪c. For very high ve-
locities, we must use the relativistic formula
λ
λ0
=
	
1 + v/c
1 −v/c −1.
(2.38)
These formulas are valid only for electromag-
netic radiation. The Doppler shift of e.g. sound

In astronomy the Doppler effect can be seen
in stellar spectra, in which the spectral lines are
often displaced towards the blue (shorter wave-
lengths) or red (longer wavelengths) end of the
spectrum. A blueshift means that the star is ap-
proaching, while a redshift indicates that it is re-
ceding.
The displacements due to the Doppler effect
are usually very small. In order to measure them,
a reference spectrum is exposed on the plate next
to the stellar spectrum. Now that CCD-cameras
have replaced photographic plates, separate cal-

to determine the wavelength scale (Sect. 3.3). The
lines in the reference spectrum are produced by
a light source at rest in the laboratory. If the ref-
erence spectrum contains some lines found also
in the stellar spectrum, the displacements can be
measured.
Also the spectra of distant galaxies show red-
shifts, but only a part of that is due to the Doppler
effect. Instead, the redshifts are caused by the ex-
pansion of the Universe (Chap. 20). Also, gravi-
tational ﬁelds cause redshifts as predicted by the
general relativity (Appendix B).
Displacements of spectral lines give the ra-
dial velocity vr of the star, and the proper mo-
tion μ can be measured from photographic plates

or CCD images. To ﬁnd the tangential velocity vt,
we have to know the distance r, obtainable from
e.g. parallax measurements. Tangential velocity
and proper motion are related by
vt = μr.
(2.39)
If μ is given in arc seconds per year and r in
parsecs we have to make the following unit trans-
formations to get vt in km/s:
1 rad = 206,265′′,
1 year = 3.156 × 107 s,
1 pc = 3.086 × 1013 km.
Hence
vt = 4.74μr,
[vt] = km/s,
[μ] = ′′/a,
[r] = pc.
(2.40)
The total velocity v of the star is then
v =

v2r + v2
t .

Constellations
At any one time, about 1000–1500 stars can be
seen in the sky (above the horizon). Under ideal
conditions, the number of stars visible to the
naked eye can be as high as 3000 on a hemi-
sphere, or 6000 altogether. Some stars seem to
form ﬁgures vaguely resembling something; for
ages they have been ascribed to various mytho-
logical and other animals. This grouping of stars
into constellations is a product of human imagi-
nation without any physical basis. Different cul-
tures have different constellations, depending on
their mythology, history and environment.
About half of the shapes and names of the
constellations we are familiar with date back
to Mediterranean antiquity. But the names and
boundaries were far from unambiguous as late as
the 19th century. Therefore the International As-
tronomical Union (IAU) conﬁrmed ﬁxed bound-
aries at its 1928 meeting.
The ofﬁcial boundaries of the constellations
were established along lines of constant right as-
cension and declination for the epoch 1875. Dur-
ing the time elapsed since then, precession has
noticeably turned the equatorial frame. However,
the boundaries remain ﬁxed with respect to the
stars. So a star belonging to a constellation will
belong to it forever (unless it is moved across the
boundary by its proper motion).
The names of the 88 constellations conﬁrmed
by the IAU are given in Table C.21 at the end of
the book. The table also gives the abbreviation of
the Latin name, its genitive (needed for names of
stars) and the English name.
In his star atlas Uranometria (1603) Johannes
Bayer started the current practice to denote the
brightest stars of each constellation by Greek let-
ters. The brightest star is usually α (alpha), e.g.
Deneb in the constellation Cygnus is α Cygni,
which is abbreviated as α Cyg. The second bright-
est star is β (beta), the next one γ (gamma) and
so on. There are, however, several exceptions to
this rule; for example, the stars of the Big Dipper
are named in the order they appear in the con-
stellation. After the Greek alphabet has been ex-
hausted, Latin letters can be employed. Another
method is to use numbers, which are assigned
in the order of increasing right ascension; e.g.
30 Tau is a bright binary star in the constellation
Taurus. These numbers are based on the star cata-
logue Historia Cœlestis Britannica (1725) by the
ﬁrst Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed. More-
over, variable stars have their special identiﬁers
(Sect. 13.1). About two hundred bright stars have
a proper name; e.g. the bright α Aur is called also
Capella.
As telescopes evolved, more and more stars
were seen and catalogued. It soon became im-
practical to continue this method of naming.
Thus most of the stars are known only by their
catalogue index numbers. One star may have
many different numbers; e.g. the abovementioned
Capella (α Aur) is number BD+45◦1077 in the
Bonner Durchmusterung and HD 34029 in the
Henry Draper catalogue.
2.12
Star Catalogues and Maps
The ﬁrst actual star catalogue was published by
Ptolemy in the second century; this catalogue
appeared in the book to be known later as Al-
magest (which is a Latin corruption of the name

32
2
Spherical Astronomy
of the Arabic translation, Al-mijisti). It had 1025
entries; the positions of these bright stars had
been measured by Hipparchos 250 years earlier.
Ptolemy’s catalogue was the only widely used
one prior to the 17th century.
The ﬁrst catalogues still being used by as-
tronomers were prepared under the direction of
Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander (1799–
1875). Argelander worked in Turku and later
served as professor of astronomy in Helsinki, but
he made his major contributions in Bonn. Using
a 72 mm telescope, he and his assistants mea-
sured the positions and estimated the magnitudes
of 320,000 stars. The catalogue, Bonner Durch-
musterung, contains nearly all stars brighter than
magnitude 9.5 between the north pole and dec-
lination −2◦. (Magnitudes are further discussed
in Chap. 4.) Argelander’s work was later used as
a model for two other large catalogues covering
the whole sky. The total number of stars in these
catalogues is close to one million (Fig. 2.30).
The purpose of these Durchmusterungen or
general catalogues was to systematically list
a great number of stars. In the zone catalogues,
the main goal is to give the positions of stars
as exactly as possible. A typical zone cata-
logue is the German Katalog der Astronomischen
Gesellschaft (AGK). Twelve observatories, each
measuring a certain region in the sky, contributed
to this catalogue. The work was begun in the
1870’s and completed at the turn of the century.
General and zone catalogues were based on vi-
sual observations with a telescope. The evolution
of photography made this kind of work unneces-
sary at the end of the 19th century. Photographic
plates could be stored for future purposes, and
measuring the positions of stars became easier
and faster, making it possible to measure many
more stars.
A great international program was started at
the end of the 19th century in order to photograph
the entire sky. Eighteen observatories participated
in this Carte du Ciel project, all using similar in-
struments and plates. The positions of stars were
ﬁrst measured with respect to a rectangular grid
exposed on each plate (Fig. 2.25a). These coor-
dinates could then be converted into declination
and right ascension.
The old plates have been useful also much
later. By observing the same areas again the
proper motions of many stars can be measured.
Positions of stars in catalogues are measured
with respect to certain comparison stars, the co-
ordinates of which are known with high accuracy.
The coordinates of these reference stars are pub-
lished in fundamental catalogues. The ﬁrst such
catalogue was needed for the AGK catalogue; it
was published in Germany in 1879. This Funda-
mental Katalog (FK 1) gives the positions of over
500 stars.
A widely used catalogue is the SAO cata-
logue, published by the Smithsonian Astrophysi-
cal Observatory in the 1960’s. It contains the ex-
act positions, magnitudes, proper motions, spec-
tral classiﬁcations, etc. of 258,997 stars brighter
than magnitude 9. The catalogue was accompa-
nied by a star map containing all the stars in the
catalogue.
In the 1990’s a large astrometric catalogue,
PPM (Positions and Proper Motions), was pub-
lished to replace the AGK and SAO catalogues. It
contained all stars brighter than 7.5 magnitudes,
and was almost complete to magnitude 8.5. Al-
together, the four volumes of the catalogue con-
tained information on 378,910 stars.
The PPM was effectively replaced by the Ty-
cho catalogue from Hipparcos satellite. Hippar-
cos was the ﬁrst astrometric satellite, and was
launched by the European Space Agency (ESA)
in 1989. Although Hipparcos didn’t reach the
planned geosynchronous orbit, it gave exact posi-
tions of over a hundred thousand stars. The Hip-
parcos catalogue, based on the measurements of
the satellite, contains astrometric and photomet-
ric data of 118,000 stars. The coordinates are pre-
cise to a couple of milliarcseconds. The less pre-
cise Tycho catalogue contains the data of about
one million stars.
In 1999 and 2000, the sixth version of the
Fundamental Katalog, the FK6, was published.
It combined the Hipparcos data and FK5 for
4150 fundamental stars. The typical mean error in
proper motion was 0.35 milliarcseconds per year
for the basic stars. With the advance of the Inter-
net, the printed versions of star catalogues were

discontinued in the ﬁrst years of the new millen-
nium, and the catalogues were moved to the In-
ternet.
In the current ICRS system (International Co-
ordinate Reference System) the celestial coordi-
nates are ﬁxed to distant quasars, the positions

of which remain pretty constant with time. The
coordinates of the epoch J2000.0 correspond to
the coordinates of this fundamental system quite
closely.
With the new media, the size of the star cat-
alogues exploded. The ﬁrst Hubble Guide Star
Catalog from the early 1990’s contained 18 mil-
lion stars and the second Guide Star Catalog
from the year 2001, nearly 500 million stars. It
was surpassed by the U.S. Naval Observatory
USNO-B1.0 Catalog, which contains entries for
1,024,618,261 stars and galaxies from digitised
images of several photographic sky surveys. The
catalogue presents right ascension and declina-
tion, proper motion and magnitude estimates.
The next step in the accuracy of astrometry
will be achieved in the 2010’s with a new Eu-
ropean astrometric satellite. The Gaia satellite
launched in 2013 has improved the accuracy to
about 10−5 seconds of arc.
The importance of astrometry is not limited
to star maps. Astrometric observations give ba-
sic information with deeper physical content also.
When the distance of a star is known, its true radi-
ation power can be calculated from the observed
brightness (Chap. 4), giving information about
the structure and evolution of the star (Chaps. 11
and 12). Motions of stars are related e.g. to the
mass distribution of the Milky Way (Chap. 18).
Star maps have been published since ancient
times, but the earliest maps were globes show-
ing the celestial sphere as seen from the outside.
At the beginning of the 17th century, a German,
Johannes Bayer, published the ﬁrst map show-
ing the stars as seen from inside the celestial
sphere, as we see them in the sky. Constellations
were usually decorated with drawings of mytho-
logical ﬁgures. The Uranometria Nova (1843) by
Argelander represents a transition towards mod-
ern maps: mythological ﬁgures are beginning to
fade away. The map accompanying the Bonner
Durchmusterung carried this evolution to its ex-
treme. The sheets contain nothing but stars and
coordinate lines.
Most maps are based on star catalogues. Pho-
tography made it possible to produce star maps
without the cataloguing stage. The most impor-
tant of such maps is a photographic atlas the
full name of which is The National Geographic
Society—Palomar Observatory Sky Atlas. The
plates for this atlas were taken with the 1.2 m
Schmidt camera on Mount Palomar. The Palomar
Sky Atlas was completed in the 1950’s. It con-
sists of 935 pairs of photographs: each region has
been photographed in red and blue light. The size
of each plate is about 35 cm × 35 cm, covering
an area of 6.6◦× 6.6◦. The prints are negatives
(black stars on a light background), because in
this way, fainter objects are visible. The limiting
magnitude is about 19 in blue and 20 in red.
The Palomar atlas covers the sky down to
−30◦. Work to map the rest of the sky was car-
ried out later at two observatories in the south-
ern hemisphere, at Siding Spring Observatory in
Australia, and at the European Southern Obser-
vatory (ESO) in Chile. The instruments and the
scale on the plates are similar to those used earlier
for the Palomar plates, but the atlas is distributed
on ﬁlm transparencies instead of paper prints.
For amateurs there are several star maps of
various kinds. Some of them are mentioned in the
references.
Several star catalogues can nowadays copied
freely from the Internet. Thus anyone with suit-
able programming skills can make star maps ap-
propriate for her own purposes.
2.13
Sidereal and Solar Time
Time measurements can be based on the rotation
of the Earth, orbital motion around the Sun, or
on atomic clocks. The last-mentioned will be dis-
cussed in the next section. Here we consider the
sidereal and solar times related to the rotation of
the Earth.
We deﬁned the sidereal time as the hour an-
gle of the vernal equinox. A good basic unit is a
sidereal day, which is the time between two suc-
cessive upper culminations of the vernal equinox.
After one sidereal day the celestial sphere with
all its stars has returned to its original position
with respect to the observer. The ﬂow of sidereal
time is as constant as the rotation of the Earth.
The rotation rate is slowly decreasing, and thus
the length of the sidereal day is increasing. In ad-
dition to the smooth slowing down irregular vari-

2.13
Sidereal and Solar Time
35
Fig. 2.31 One sidereal day is the time between two
successive transits or upper culminations of the vernal
equinox. By the time the Earth has moved from A to B,
one sidereal day has elapsed. The angle  is greatly exag-
gerated; in reality, it is slightly less than one degree
ations of the order of one millisecond have been
observed.
Unfortunately, also the sidereal time comes in
two varieties, apparent and mean. The apparent
sidereal time is determined by the true vernal
equinox, and so it is obtained directly from ob-
servations.
Because of the precession the ecliptic longi-
tude of the vernal equinox increases by about
50′′ a year. This motion is very smooth. Nutation
causes more complicated wobbling. The mean
equinox is the point where the vernal equinox
would be if there were no nutation. The mean
sidereal time is the hour angle of this mean
equinox.
The difference of the apparent and mean side-
real time is called the equation of equinoxes:
Θa −ΘM = ψ cosε,
(2.42)
where ε is the obliquity of the ecliptic at the in-
stant of the observation, and ψ, the nutation in
longitude. This value is tabulated for each day
e.g. in the Astronomical Almanac. It can also be
computed from the formulae given in Box 2.1. It
is at most about one second, so it has to be taken
into account only in the most precise calculations.
Figure 2.31 shows the Sun and the Earth at
vernal equinox. When the Earth is at the point A,
the Sun culminates and, at the same time, a new
sidereal day begins in the city with the huge black
arrow standing in its central square. After one
sidereal day, the Earth has moved along its orbit
almost one degree of arc to the point B. There-
fore the Earth has to turn almost a degree further
before the Sun will culminate. The solar or syn-
odic day is therefore 3 min 56.56 s (sidereal time)
longer than the sidereal day. This means that the
beginning of the sidereal day will move around
the clock during the course of one year. After
one year, sidereal and solar time will again be in
phase. The number of sidereal days in one year is
one higher than the number of solar days.
When we talk about rotation periods of plan-
ets, we usually mean sidereal periods. The length
of day, on the other hand, means the rotation pe-
riod with respect to the Sun. If the orbital period
around the Sun is P , sidereal rotation period τ∗
and synodic day τ, we now know that the num-
ber of sidereal days in time P , P/τ∗, is one higher
than the number of synodic days, P/τ:
P
τ∗
−P
τ = 1,
or
1
τ = 1
τ∗
−1
P .
(2.43)
This holds for a planet rotating in the direction of
its orbital motion (counterclockwise). If the sense
of rotation is opposite, or retrograde, the number
of sidereal days in one orbital period is one less
than the number of synodic days, and the equa-
tion becomes
1
τ = 1
τ∗
+ 1
P .
(2.44)
For the Earth, we have P = 365.2564 d, and
τ = 1 d, whence (2.43) gives τ∗= 0.99727 d =
23 h 56 min 4 s, solar time.
Since our everyday life follows the alternation
of day and night, it is more convenient to base our
timekeeping on the apparent motion of the Sun
rather than that of the stars. Unfortunately, the so-
lar time does not ﬂow at a constant rate. There are
two reasons for this. First, the orbit of the Earth is
not exactly circular, but an ellipse, which means
that the velocity of the Earth along its orbit is
not constant. Second, the Sun moves along the
ecliptic, not the equator. Thus its right ascension

36
2
Spherical Astronomy
does not increase at a constant rate. The change
is fastest at the end of December (4 min 27 s per
day) and slowest in mid-September (3 min 35 s
per day). As a consequence, the hour angle of the
Sun (which determines the solar time) also grows
at an uneven rate.
To ﬁnd a solar time ﬂowing at a constant rate,
we deﬁne a ﬁctitious mean sun, which moves
along the celestial equator with constant angu-
lar velocity, making a complete revolution in one
year. By year we mean here the tropical year,
which is the time it takes for the Sun to move
from one vernal equinox to the next. In one trop-
ical year, the right ascension of the Sun increases
exactly 24 hours. The length of the tropical year
is 365 d 5 h 48 min 46 s = 365.2422 d. Since the
direction of the vernal equinox moves due to pre-
cession, the tropical year differs from the sidereal
year, during which the Sun makes one revolution
with respect to the background stars. One sidereal
year is 365.2564 d.
Using our artiﬁcial mean sun, we now deﬁne
an evenly ﬂowing solar time, the mean solar time
(or simply mean time) TM, which is equal to the
hour angle hM of the centre of the mean sun plus
12 hours (so that the date will change at midnight,
to annoy astronomers):
TM = hM + 12 h.
(2.45)
The difference between the true solar time T
and the mean time TM is called the equation of
time:
E.T. = T −TM.
(2.46)
(In spite of the identical abbreviation, this has
nothing to do with a certain species of little green
men.) The greatest positive value of E.T. is about
16 minutes and the greatest negative value about
−14 minutes (see Fig. 2.32). This is also the dif-
ference between the true noon (the meridian tran-
sit of the Sun) and the mean noon.
Both the true solar time and mean time are
local times, depending on the hour angle of the
Sun, real or artiﬁcial. If one observes the true so-
lar time by direct measurement and computes the
mean time from (2.46), a digital watch will prob-
ably be found to disagree with both of them. The
reason for this is that we do not use local time in
Fig. 2.32 Equation of time. A sundial always shows (if
correctly installed) true local solar time. To ﬁnd the local
mean time the equation of time must be subtracted from
the local solar time
our everyday life; instead we use the zonal time
of the nearest time zone.
In the past, each city had its own local time.
When travelling became faster and more popu-
lar, the great variety of local times became an in-
convenience. At the end of the 19th century, the
Earth was divided into 24 zones, the time of each
zone differing from the neighbouring ones by one
hour. On the surface of the Earth, one hour in time
corresponds to 15◦in longitude; the time of each
zone is determined by the local mean time at one
of the longitudes 0◦,15◦,...,345◦.
The time of the zero meridian going through
Greenwich is used as an international reference,
Universal Time. In most European countries, time
is one hour ahead of this (Fig. 2.33).
In summer, many countries switch to daylight
saving time, during which time is one hour ahead
of the ordinary time. The purpose of this is to
make the time when people are awake coincide
with daytime in order to save electricity, particu-
larly in the evening, when people go to bed one
hour earlier. During daylight saving time, the dif-
ference between the true solar time and the ofﬁ-
cial time can grow even larger. It has also been
criticised that the disadvantages of the daylight
saving time are much more severe than its proﬁts
in energy saving. Many people have serious difﬁ-
culties to adapt to a different daily rhythm twice
every year. Also, confusingly, different countries
use different rules for the daylight saving time.
In the EU countries the daylight saving time
begins on the last Sunday of March, at 1 o’clock
UTC in the morning, when the clocks are moved

2.13

given ﬁgures. When travelling across the date line westward, the date must be incremented by one day, and decremented if going eastward. For example, a traveller taking a ﬂight
from Honolulu to Tokyo on Monday morning will arrive on Tuesday, even though (s)he does not see a single night en route. In 2015 North Korea adopted time zone UTC+8.5
h, which is half an hour behind the South Korean time. (Drawing U.S. Naval Observatory)

of October at 1 o’clock UTC.
2.14
Astronomical Time Systems
Time can be deﬁned using several different phe-
nomena:
1. The solar and sidereal times are based on the
rotation of the Earth.
2. The standard unit of time in the current SI sys-
tem, the second, is based on quantum mechan-
ical atomary phenomena.
3. Equations of physics like the ones describing
the motions of celestial bodies involve a time
variable corresponding to an ideal time run-
ning at a constant pace. The ephemeris time
and dynamical time discussed a little later are
such times.
Observations give directly the apparent side-
real time as the hour angle of the true vernal
equinox. From the apparent sidereal time the
mean sidereal time can be calculated.
The universal time UT is deﬁned by the equa-
tion
GMST(0 UT) = 24,110.54841 s
+ T × 8,640,184.812866 s
+ T 2 × 0.093104 s
−T 3 × 0.0000062 s,
(2.47)
where GMST is the Greenwich mean sidereal
time and T the Julian century. The latter is ob-
tained from the Julian date J , which is a running
number of the day (Sects. 2.15 and Box 2.2):
T = J −2,451,545.0
36,525
.
(2.48)
This gives the time elapsed since January 1, 2000,
in Julian centuries.
Sidereal time and hence also UT are related
to the rotation of the Earth, and thus contain per-
turbations due to the irregular variations, mainly
slowing down, of the rotation.
In (2.47) the constant 8,640,184.812866 s
tells how much sidereal time runs fast compared
to the UT in a Julian century. As the rotation of
the Earth is slowing down the solar day becomes
longer. Since the Julian century T contains a ﬁxed
number of days, it will also become longer. This
gives rise to the small correction terms in (2.47).
Strictly speaking this universal time is the time
denoted by UT1. Observations give UT0, which
contains a small perturbation due to the wander-
ing of the geographical pole, or polar variation.
The direction of the axis with respect to the solid
surface varies by about 0.1′′ (a few metres on the
surface) with a period of about 430 days (Chan-
dler period). In addition to this, the polar motion
contains a slow nonperiodic part.
The z axis of the astronomical coordinates is
aligned with the angular momentum vector of the
Earth, but the terrestrial coordinates refer to the
axis at the epoch 1903.5. In the most accurate cal-
culations this has to be taken into account.
Due to the polar variation the UT0 does not
grow at a constant rate, since also the direction
of the origin, the Greenwich meridian, is vary-
ing. There are also additional irregular variations
of the order of a millisecond, and the secular
slowing-down caused by tidal forces.
Nowadays the SI unit of time, the second, is
deﬁned in a way that has nothing to do with celes-
tial phenomena. Periods of quantum mechanical
phenomena remain more stable than the motions
of celestial bodies involving complicated pertur-
bations.
In
1967,
one
second
was
deﬁned
as
9,192,631,770 times the period of the light emit-
ted by cesium 133 isotope in its ground state,
transiting from hyperﬁne level F = 4 to F = 3.
Later, this deﬁnition was revised to include
small relativistic effects produced by gravita-
tional ﬁelds. The relative accuracy of this atomic
time is about 10−12. The international atomic
time, TAI, was adopted as the basis of time sig-
nals in 1972. The time is maintained by the Bu-
reau International des Poids et Mesures in Paris,
and it is the average of several accurate atomic
clocks.
Even before atomic clocks there was a need
for an ideal time proceeding at a perfectly con-
stant rate, corresponding to the time variable
in the equations of Newtonian mechanics. The

2.14
Astronomical Time Systems
39
ephemeris time was such a time. It was used
e.g. for tabulating ephemerides. The unit of
ephemeris time was the ephemeris second, which
is the length of the tropical year 1900 divided by
31,556,925.9747. Ephemeris time was not known
in advance. Only afterwards was it possible to de-
termine the difference of ET and UT from obser-
vational data.
In 1984 ephemeris time was replaced by dy-
namical time. It comes in two varieties.
The terrestrial dynamical time (TDT) corre-
sponds to the proper time of an observer moving
with the Earth. The time scale is affected by the
relativistic time dilation due to the orbital speed
of the Earth. The rotation velocity depends on
the latitude, and thus in TDT it is assumed that
the observer is not rotating with the Earth. The
zero point of TDT was chosen so that the old ET
changed without a jump to TDT.
In 1991 a new standard time, the terrestrial
time (TT), was adopted. Practically it is equiva-
lent to TDT.
TT (or TDT) is the time currently used for tab-
ulating ephemerides of planets and other celestial
bodies. For example, the Astronomical Almanac
gives the coordinates of the planets for each day
at 0 TT.
The Astronomical Almanac also gives the dif-
ference
T = TDT −UT
(2.49)
for earlier years. For the present year and some
future years a prediction extrapolated from the
earlier years is given. Its accuracy is about 0.1 s.
At the beginning of 1990 the difference was
56.7 s; it increases every year by an amount that
is usually a little less than one second.
The terrestrial time differs from the atomic
time by a constant offset
TT = TAI + 32.184 s.
(2.50)
TT is well suited for ephemerides of phenom-
ena as seen from the Earth. The equations of mo-
tion of the solar system, however, are solved in
a frame the origin of which is the centre of mass
or barycentre of the solar system. The coordinate
time of this frame is called the barycentric dy-
namical time, TDB. The unit of TDB is deﬁned
so that, on the average, it runs at the same rate as
TT, the difference containing only periodic terms
depending on the orbital motion of the Earth. The
difference can usually be neglected, since it is at
most about 0.002 seconds.
Which of these many times should we use
in our alarm-clocks? None of them. Yet another
time is needed for that purpose. This ofﬁcial wall-
clock time is called the coordinated universal
time, UTC. The zonal time follows UTC but dif-
fers from it usually by an integral number of
hours.
UTC is deﬁned so that it proceeds at the same
rate as TAI, but differs from it by an integral num-
ber of seconds. These leap seconds are used to ad-
just UTC so that the difference from UT1 never
exceeds 0.9 seconds (Fig. 2.34). A leap second
is added either at the beginning of a year or the
night between June and July.
The difference
AT = TAI −UTC
(2.51)
is also tabulated in the Astronomical Almanac.
According to the deﬁnition of UTC the difference
in seconds is always an integer. The difference
cannot be predicted very far to the future.
From (2.50) and (2.51) we get
TT = UTC + 32.184 s + AT,
(2.52)
which gives the terrestrial time TT corresponding
to a given UTC. Table 2.2 gives this correction.
The table is easy to extend to the future. When
it is told in the news that a leap second will be
added the difference will increase by one second.
In case the number of leap seconds is not known,
it can be approximated that a leap second will be
added every 1.25 years.
The units of the coordinated universal time
UTC, atomic time TAI and terrestrial time TT are
the same second of the SI system. Hence all these
times proceed at the same rate, the only differ-
ence being in their zero points. The difference of
the TAI and TT is always the same, but due to the
leap seconds the UTC will fall behind in a slightly
irregular way.
Culminations and rising and setting times of
celestial bodies are related to the rotation of the

rotation of the Earth is slowing down, the UT1 will run
slow of the UTC by about 0.8 seconds a year. Leap sec-
onds are added to the UTC when necessary to keep the
times approximately equal. In the graph these leap sec-
onds are seen as one second jumps upward

of such an event can be calculated precisely. The
corresponding UTC cannot differ from the UT by

Calendars
Our calendar is a result of long evolution. The
main problem it must contend with is the incom-
mensurability of the basic units, day, month and
year: the numbers of days and months in a year
are not integers. This makes it rather complicated
to develop a calendar that takes correctly into ac-
count the alternation of seasons, day and night,
and perhaps also the lunar phases.
Our calendar has its origin in the Roman cal-
endar, which, in its earliest form, was based on
the phases of the Moon. From around 700 B.C.
on, the length of the year has followed the appar-
ent motion of the Sun; thus originated the division
of the year into twelve months. One month, how-
ever, still had a length roughly equal to the lunar
cycle. Hence one year was only 354 days long.
To keep the year synchronised with the seasons,
a leap month had to be added to every other year.
Eventually the Roman calendar got mixed up.
The mess was cleared by Julius Caesar in about
46 B.C., when the Julian calendar was developed

2.15
Calendars
41
upon his orders by the Alexandrian astronomer
Sosigenes. The year had 365 days and a leap day
was added to every fourth year.
In the Julian calendar, the average length of
one year is 365 d 6 h, but the tropical year is
11 min 14 s shorter. After 128 years, the Julian
year begins almost one day too late. The differ-
ence was already 10 days in 1582, when a calen-
dar reform was carried out by Pope Gregory XIII.
In the Gregorian calendar, every fourth year is
a leap year, the years divisible by 100 being ex-
ceptions. Of these, only the years divisible by 400
are leap years. Thus 1900 was not a leap year, but
2000 was. The Gregorian calendar was adopted
slowly, at different times in different countries.
Although the calendar reform was seen neces-
sary, orders given by the catholic pope were not
easy to accept in e.g. protestant countries. The
transition period did not end before the 20th cen-
tury.
Even the Gregorian calendar is not perfect.
The differences from the tropical year will accu-
mulate to one day in about 3300 years.
Since years and months of variable length
make it difﬁcult to compute time differences,
especially astronomers have employed various
methods to give each day a running number. The
most widely used numbers are the Julian dates.
In spite of their name, they are not related to the
Julian calendar. The only connection is the length
of a Julian century of 36,525 days, a quantity ap-
pearing in many formulas involving Julian dates.
The Julian day number 0 dawned in 4713 B.C.
The day number changes always at 12 : 00 UT.
For example, the Julian day 2,451,545 began at
noon in January 1, 2000. The Julian date can be
computed using the formulas given in Box 2.2.
Julian dates are uncomfortably big numbers,
and therefore modiﬁed Julian dates are often
used. The zero point can be e.g. January 1, 2000.
Sometimes 0.5 is subtracted from the date to
make it to coincide with the date corresponding to
the UTC. When using such dates, the zero point
should always be mentioned.
Box 2.1 (Reduction of Coordinates)
Star cat-
alogues give coordinates for some standard
epoch. In the following we give the formulas
needed to reduce the coordinates to a given date
and time. The full reduction is rather labori-
ous, but the following simpliﬁed version is suf-
ﬁcient for most practical purposes.
We assume that the coordinates are given for
the epoch J2000.0.
1. First correct the place for proper motion un-
less it is negligible.
2. Precess the coordinates to the time of the
observation. First we use the coordinates of
the standard epoch (α0,δ0) to ﬁnd a unit
vector pointing in the direction of the star:
p0 =
⎛
⎝
cosδ0 cosα0
cosδ0 sinα0
sinδ0
⎞
⎠.
Precession changes the ecliptic longitude of
the object. The effect on right ascension and
declination can be calculated as three rota-
tions, given by three rotation matrices. By
multiplying these matrices we get the com-
bined precession matrix that maps the pre-
vious unit vector to its precessed equiva-
lent. A similar matrix can be derived for the
nutation. The transformations and constants
given here are based on the system standard-
ised by the IAU in 1976.
The precession and nutation matrices
contain several quantities depending on
time. The time variables appearing in their
expressions are
t = J −2,451,545.0,
T = J −2,451,545.0
36,525
.
Here J is the Julian date of the observa-
tion, t the number of days since the epoch
J2000.0 (i.e. noon of January 1, 2000), and
T the same interval of time in Julian cen-
turies.
The following three angles are needed
for the precession matrix
ζ = 2306.2181′′T + 0.30188′′T 2
+ 0.017998′′T 3,

42

Spherical Astronomy
z = 2306.2181′′T + 1.09468′′T 2
+ 0.018203′′T 3,
θ = 2004.3109′′T −0.42665′′T 2
−0.041833′′T 3.
The precession matrix is now
P =
⎛
⎝
P11
P12
P13
P21
P22
P23
P31
P32
P33
⎞
⎠.
The elements of this matrix in terms of the
abovementioned angles are
P11 = coszcosθ cosζ −sinzsinζ,
P12 = −coszcosθ sinζ −sinzcosζ,
P13 = −coszsinθ,
P21 = sinzcosθ cosζ + coszsinζ,
P22 = −sinzcosθ sinζ + coszcosζ,
P23 = −sinzsinθ,
P31 = sinθ cosζ,
P32 = −sinθ sinζ,
P33 = cosθ.
The new coordinates are now obtained by
multiplying the coordinates of the standard
epoch by the precession matrix:
p1 = Pp0.
This is the mean place at the given time and
date.
If the standard epoch is not J2000.0, it is
probably easiest to ﬁrst transform the given
coordinates to the epoch J2000.0. This can
be done by computing the precession matrix
for the given epoch and multiplying the co-
ordinates by the inverse of this matrix. In-
verting the precession matrix is easy: we
just transpose it, i.e. interchange its rows
and columns. Thus coordinates given for
some epoch can be precessed to J2000.0 by
multiplying them by
P −1 =
⎛
⎝
P11
P21
P31
P12
P22
P32
P13
P23
P33
⎞
⎠.
In case the required accuracy is higher than
about one minute of arc, we have to do the
following further corrections.
3. The full nutation correction is rather com-
plicated. The nutation used in astronomical
almanacs involves series expansions con-
taining over a hundred terms. Very often,
though, the following simple form is sufﬁ-
cient. We begin by ﬁnding the mean obliq-
uity of the ecliptic at the observation time:
ε0 = 23◦26′ 21.448′′ −46.8150′′T
−0.00059′′T 2 + 0.001813′′T 3.
The mean obliquity means that periodic per-
turbations have been omitted. The formula
is valid a few centuries before and after the
year 2000.
The true obliquity of the ecliptic, ε, is ob-
tained by adding the nutation correction to
the mean obliquity:
ε = ε0 + ε.
The effect of the nutation on the ecliptic
longitude (denoted usually by ψ) and the
obliquity of the ecliptic can be found from
C1 = 125◦−0.05295◦t,
C2 = 200.9◦+ 1.97129◦t,
ψ = −0.0048◦sinC1 −0.0004◦sinC2,
ε = 0.0026◦cosC1 + 0.0002◦cosC2.
Since ψ and ε are very small angles,
we have, for example, sinψ ≈ψ and
cosψ ≈1, when the angles are expressed
in radians. Thus we get the nutation matrix
N =
⎛
⎝
1
−ψ cosε
−ψ sinε
ψ cosε
1
−ε
ψ sinε
ε

⎞
⎠.

This is a linearised version of the full trans-
formation. The angles here must be in radi-
ans. The place in the coordinate frame of the
observing time is now
p2 = Np1.
4. The annual aberration can affect the place
about as much as the nutation. Approximate
corrections are obtained from
α cosδ = −20.5′′ sinα sinλ
−18.8′′ cosα cosλ,
δ = 20.5′′ cosα sinδ sinλ
+ 18.8′′ sinα sinδ cosλ
−8.1′′ cosδ cosλ,
where λ is the ecliptic longitude of the Sun.
Sufﬁciently accurate value for this purpose
is given by
G = 357.528◦+ 0.985600◦t,
λ = 280.460◦+ 0.985647◦t
+ 1.915◦sinG + 0.020◦sin2G.
These reductions give the apparent place of
the date with an accuracy of a few seconds
of arc. The effects of parallax and diurnal
aberration are even smaller.

The
coordinates
of
Regulus
(α Leo) for the epoch J2000.0 are
α = 10 h 8 min 22.2 s = 10.139500 h,
δ = 11◦58′ 02′′ = 11.967222◦.
Find the apparent place of Regulus on March
12, 1995.
We start by ﬁnding the unit vector corre-
sponding to the catalogued place:
p0 =
⎛
⎝
−0.86449829
0.45787318
0.20735204
⎞
⎠.
The Julian date is J = 2,449,789.0, and
thus t = −1756 and T = −0.04807666. The
angles of the precession matrix are ζ =
−0.03079849◦, z = −0.03079798◦and θ =
−0.02676709◦. The precession matrix is then
P =
⎛
⎝
0.99999931
0.00107506
0.00046717
−0.00107506
0.99999942
−0.00000025
−0.00046717
−0.00000025
0.99999989
⎞
⎠.
The precessed unit vector is
p1 =
⎛
⎝
−0.86390858
0.45880225
0.20775577
⎞
⎠.
The angles needed for the nutation are
ψ = 0.00309516◦, ε = −0.00186227◦,
ε = 23.43805403◦, which give the nutation
matrix
N =
⎛
⎝
1
−0.00004956
−0.00002149

1
0.00003250
0.00002149
−0.00003250

⎞
⎠.
The place in the frame of the date is
p2 =
⎛
⎝
−0.86393578
0.45876618
0.20772230
⎞
⎠,
whence
α = 10.135390 h,
δ = 11.988906◦.
To correct for the aberration we ﬁrst ﬁnd the
longitude of the Sun: G = −1373.2◦= 66.8◦,
λ = −8.6◦. The correction terms are then
α = 18.25′′ = 0.0050◦,
δ = −5.46′′ = −0.0015◦.
Adding these to the previously obtained coor-
dinates we get the apparent place of Regulus
on March 12, 1995:
α = 10.1357 h = 10 h 8 min 8.5 s,
δ = 11.9874◦= 11◦59′ 15′′.

Comparison with the places given in the cat-
alogue Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars
shows that we are within about 3′′ of the correct
place, which is a satisfactory result.
Box 2.2 (Julian Date) There are several meth-
ods for ﬁnding the Julian date. The following
one, developed by Fliegel and Van Flandern in
1968, is well adapted for computer programs.
Let y be the year (with all four digits), m the
month and d the day. The Julian date J at noon
is then
J = 367y −

−7/3 = −2.
Example

= 2,447,893.
Astronomical tables usually give the Julian
date at 0 UT. In this case that would be
2,447,892.5.
The inverse procedure is a little more com-
plicated. In the following J is the Julian date at
noon (so that it will be an integer):
a = J + 68,569,
b = (4a)/146,097,
c = a −(146,097b + 3)/4,

day = e −(2447f )/80,
g = f/11,
month = f + 2 −12g,
year = 100(b −49) + d + g.
Example
In the previous example we got
J = 2,447,893. Let’s check this by calculating
the corresponding calendar date:
a = 2,447,893 + 68,569 = 2,516,462,
b = (4 × 2,516,462)/146,097 = 68,
c = 2,516,462 −(146,097 × 68 + 3)/4
= 32,813,
d =

4000(32,813 + 1)

/1,461,001 = 89,
e = 32,813 −(1461 × 89)/4 + 31 = 337,
f = (80 × 337)/2447 = 11,
day = 337 −(2447 × 11)/80 = 1,
g = 11/11 = 1,
month = 11 + 2 −12 × 1 = 1,
year = 100(68 −49) + 89 + 1 = 1990.
Thus we arrived back to the original date.
Since the days of the week repeat in seven
day cycles, the remainder of the division
J/7 unambiguously determines the day of the
week. If J is the Julian date at noon, the re-
mainder of J/7 tells the day of the week in the
following way:
0 = Monday,
...
5 = Saturday,
6 = Sunday.
Example
The
Julian
date
corresponding
to January 1, 1990 was 2,447,893. Since
2,447,893 = 7 × 349,699, the remainder is
zero, and the day was Monday.

Example 2.1 (Trigonometric Functions in a Rect-
angular Spherical Triangle) Let the angle A be
a right angle. When the ﬁgure is a plane triangle,
the trigonometric functions of the angle B would
be:
sinB = b/a,
cosB = c/a,
tanB = b/c.
For the spherical triangle we have to use the
equations in (2.7), which are now simply:
sinB sina = sinb,
cosB sina = cosb sinc,
cosa = cosb cosc.
The ﬁrst equation gives the sine of B:
sinB = sinb/sina.
Dividing the second equation by the third one, we
get the cosine of B:
cosB = tanc/tana.
And the tangent is obtained by dividing the ﬁrst
equation by the second one:
tanB = tanb/sinc.
The third equation is the equivalent of the Pytha-
gorean theorem for rectangular triangles.
Example 2.2 (Distance Between Two Locations)
The latitude of Helsinki is about φ1 = 60◦and
longitude λ1 = 25◦. The corresponding coordi-
nates of La Palma are φ2 = 28.7◦and λ2 =
−17.9◦. What is the distance between these lo-
cations measured along the surface of the Earth.
The distance can be found by applying the co-
sine formula to the spherical triangle NHP:
cosa = cos(λ2 −λ1)sin(90◦−φ1)
× sin(90◦−φ2)
+ cos(90◦−φ1)cos(90◦−φ2)
= cos(λ2 −λ1)cosφ1 cosφ2
+ sinφ1 sinφ2)
= 0.7325 × 0.5 × 0.8771
+ 0.8660 × 0.4802
= 0.7372,
from which a = 42.5◦.
Another method is to use vector calculus (Ap-
pendix A). The radius vector with respect to the
centre of the Earth is
r = R(cosφ cosλ, cosφ sinλ, sinφ),
where R is the radius of the Earth. In the follow-
ing, only unit vectors are needed, and thus we can
omit the constant R. In the example th unit vec-
tors are
r1 = (0.4532, 0.2113, 0.8660),
r2 = (0.8347, −0.2696, 0.4802).
The scalar product of these vectors gives the co-
sine of the angle between the vectors:
cosa = r1 · r2
= 0.4532 × 0.8347 −0.2113 × 0.2696
+ 0.8660 × 0.4802
= 0.7372,
from which a = 42.5◦= 0.7419 rad.
Both methods give the same angular sepa-
ration between the two locations. The distance
along the great circle on the surface of the Earth
is then Ra = 6400 × 0.7419 = 4748 km.
Example 2.3 (The Coordinates of New York
City) The geographic coordinates are 41◦north
and 74◦west of Greenwich, or φ = +41◦, λ =
−74◦. In time units, the longitude would be
74/15 h = 4 h 56 min west of Greenwich. The

The geocentric latitude is 11′ 26′′ less than the ge-

Example 2.4 The angular separation of two ob-
jects in the sky is quite different from their coor-
dinate difference.
Suppose the coordinates of a star A are α1 =
10 h, δ1 = 70◦and those of another star B, α2 =
11 h, δ2 = 80◦.
Using the Pythagorean theorem for plane tri-
angles, we would get
d =

(15◦)2 + (10◦)2 = 18◦.
But if we use the third equation in (2.7), we get
cosd = cos(α1 −α2)
× sin(90◦−δ1)sin(90◦−δ2)
+ cos(90◦−δ1)cos(90◦−δ2)
= cos(α1 −α2)cosδ1 cosδ2
+ sinδ1 sinδ2
= cos15◦cos70◦cos80◦
+ sin70◦sin80◦
= 0.983,
which yields d = 10.6◦. The ﬁgure shows why
the result obtained from the Pythagorean theorem
is so far from being correct: hour circles (circles
with α = constant) approach each other towards
the poles and their angular separation becomes
smaller, though the coordinate difference remains
the same.
Example 2.5 Find the altitude and azimuth of
the Moon in Helsinki at midnight at the begin-
ning of 1996.
The right ascension is α = 2 h 55 min 7 s =
2.9186 h and declination δ = 14◦42′ = 14.70◦,
the sidereal time is Θ = 6 h 19 min 26 s =
6.3239 h and latitude φ = 60.16◦.
The hour angle is h = Θ −α = 3.4053 h =
51.08◦. Next we apply the equations in (2.16):
sinAcosa = sin51.08◦cos14.70◦= 0.7526,
cosAcosa = cos51.08◦cos14.70◦sin60.16◦
−sin14.70◦cos60.16◦
= 0.4008,
sina = cos51.08◦cos14.70◦cos60.16◦
+ sin14.70◦sin60.16◦
= 0.5225.
Thus the altitude is a = 31.5◦. To ﬁnd the az-
imuth we have to compute its sine and cosine:
sinA = 0.8827,
cosA = 0.4701.
Hence the azimuth is A = 62.0◦. The Moon is
in the southwest, 31.5 degrees above the horizon.
Actually, this would be the direction if the Moon
were inﬁnitely distant.
Example 2.6 Find the topocentric place of the
Moon in the case of the previous example.
The geocentric distance of the Moon at that
time is R = 62.58 equatorial radii of the Earth.
For simplicity, we can assume that the Earth is
spherical.
We set up a rectangular coordinate frame in
such a way that the z axis points towards the
celestial pole and the observing site is in the
xz plane. When the radius of the Earth is used
as the unit of distance, the radius vector of the
observing site is
r0 =
⎛
⎝

⎠=
⎛

The topocentric place of the Moon is

⎠.
We divide this vector by its length 62.07 to get
the unit vector e pointing to the direction of the
Moon. This can be expressed in terms of the
topocentric coordinates δ′ and h′:
e =
⎛
⎝
0.6047
−0.7588
0.2420
⎞
⎠=
⎛
⎝
cosδ′ cosh′

⎞
⎠,
which gives δ′ = 14.00◦and h′ = 51.45◦. Next
we can calculate the altitude and azimuth as in
the previous example, and we get a = 30.7◦, A =
61.9◦.
Another way to ﬁnd the altitude is to take the
scalar product of the vectors e and r0, which
gives the cosine of the zenith distance:
cosz = e · r0 = 0.6047 × 0.4976
+ 0.2420 × 0.8674
= 0.5108,
whence z = 59.3◦and a = 90◦−z = 30.7◦. We
see that this is 0.8◦less than the geocentric alti-
tude; i.e. the difference is more than the apparent
diameter of the Moon.
Example 2.7 The coordinates of Arcturus are
α = 14 h 15.7 min, δ = 19◦11′. Find the side-
real time at the moment Arcturus rises or sets in
Boston (φ = 42◦19′).
Neglecting refraction, we get
cosh = −tan19◦11′ tan42◦19′
= −0.348 × 0.910 = −0.317.
Hence, h = ±108.47◦= 7 h 14 min. The more
accurate result is
cosh = −tan19◦11′ tan42◦19′
−
sin35′
cos19◦11′ cos42◦19′
= −0.331,
whence h = ±109.35◦= 7 h 17 min. The plus
and minus signs correspond to setting ant ris-
ing, respectively. When Arcturus rises, the side-
real time is
Θ = α + h = 14 h 16 min −7 h 17 min
= 6 h 59 min
and when it sets, the sidereal time is
Θ = 14 h 16 min + 7 h 17 min
= 21 h 33 min.
Note that the result is independent of the date:
a star rises and sets at the same sidereal time ev-
ery day.
Example 2.8 The proper motion of Aldebaran is
μ = 0.20′′/a and parallax π = 0.048′′. The spec-

Example 2.9 Find the local time in Paris (longi-
tude λ = 2◦) at 12:00.
Local time coincides with the zonal time along
the meridian 15◦east of Greenwich. Longitude
difference 15◦−2◦= 13◦equals (13◦/15◦) ×
60 min = 52 minutes. The local time is 52 min-
utes less than the ofﬁcial time, or 11:08. This is
mean solar time. To ﬁnd the true solar time, we
must add the equation of time. In early Febru-
ary, E.T. = −14 min and the true solar time is
11:08 −14 min = 10:54. At the beginning of
November, ET = +16 min and the solar time
would be 11:24. Since −14 min and +16 min are
the extreme values of E.T., the true solar time is
in the range 10:54–11:24, the exact time depend-
ing on the day of the year. During daylight saving
time, we must still subtract one hour from these
times.
Example 2.10 (Estimating Sidereal Time) Since
the sidereal time is the hour angle of the vernal
equinox Υ , it is 0 h when Υ culminates or transits
the south meridian. At the moment of the vernal
equinox, the Sun is in the direction of Υ and thus
culminates at the same time as Υ . So the sidereal
time at 12:00 local solar time is 0:00, and at the
time of the vernal equinox, we have
Θ = T + 12 h,
where T is the local solar time. This is accu-
rate within a couple of minutes. Since the sidereal
time runs about 4 minutes fast a day, the sidereal
time, n days after the vernal equinox, is
Θ ≈T + 12 h + n × 4 min.
At autumnal equinox Υ culminates at 0:00 local
time, and sidereal and solar times are equal.
Let us try to ﬁnd the sidereal time in Paris
on April 15 at 22:00, Central European standard
time (= 23:00 daylight saving time). The vernal
equinox occurs on the average on March 21; thus
the time elapsed since the equinox is 10 + 15 =
25 days. Neglecting the equation of time, the lo-
cal time T is 52 minutes less than the zonal time.
Hence
Θ = T + 12 h + n × 4 min
= 21 h 8 min + 12 h + 25 × 4 min
= 34 h 48 min = 10 h 48 min.
The time of the vernal equinox can vary about one
day in either direction from the average. There-
fore the accuracy of the result is roughly 5 min.
Example 2.11 Find the rising time of Arcturus
in Boston on January 10.
In Example 2.6 we found the sidereal time
of this event, Θ = 6 h 59 min. Since we do not
know the year, we use the rough method of Ex-
ample 2.9. The time between January 1 and ver-
nal equinox (March 21) is about 70 days. Thus
the sidereal time on January 1 is
Θ ≈T + 12 h −70 × 4 min = T + 7 h 20 min,
from which
T = Θ −7 h 20 min = 6 h 59 min −7 h 20 min
= 30 h 59 min −7 h 20 min = 23 h 39 min.
The longitude of Boston is 71◦W, and the Eastern
standard time is (4◦/15◦) × 60 min = 16 minutes
less, or 23:23.
Example 2.12 Find the sidereal time in Helsinki
on April 15, 1982 at 20:00 UT.
The Julian date is J = 2,445,074.5 and
T = 2,445,074.5 −2,451,545.0
36,525
= −0.1771526.
Next, we use (2.47) to ﬁnd the sidereal time at
0 UT:
Θ0 = −1,506,521.0 s = −418 h 28 min 41 s
= 13 h 31 min 19 s.

Since the sidereal time runs 3 min 57 s fast a day
as compared to the solar time, the difference in
20 hours will be
20
24 × 3 min 57 s = 3 min 17 s,
and the sidereal time at 20 UT will be 13 h 31 min
19 s + 20 h 3 min 17 s = 33 h 34 min 36 s = 9 h
34 min 36 s.
At the same time (at 22:00 Finnish time,
23:00 daylight saving time) in Helsinki the side-
real time is ahead of this by the amount cor-
responding to the longitude of Helsinki, 25◦,
i.e. 1 h 40 min 00 s. Thus the sidereal time is
11 h 14 min 36 s.

Observations and Instruments
Up to the end of the Middle Ages, the most im-
portant means of observation in astronomy was
the human eye. It was aided by various mechan-
ical devices to measure the positions of celes-
tial bodies in the sky. The telescope was invented
in Holland at the beginning of the 17th century,
and in 1609 Galileo Galilei made his ﬁrst astro-
nomical observations with this new instrument.
Astronomical photography was introduced at the
end of the 19th century, and during the last few
decades many kinds of electronic detectors have
been adopted for the study of electromagnetic
radiation from space. The electromagnetic spec-
trum from the shortest gamma rays to long radio
waves can now be used for astronomical observa-
tions.
3.1
Observing Through the
Atmosphere
With satellites and spacecraft, observations can
be made outside the atmosphere. Yet, the great
majority of astronomical observations are carried
out from the surface of the Earth. In the preceding
chapter, we discussed refraction, which changes
the apparent altitudes of objects. The atmosphere
affects observations in many other, more seri-
ous ways as well. Real problems are the weather,
restlessness of the atmosphere, and, worst of all,
opacity of the atmosphere in many wavelength re-
gions.
The air is never quite steady, and there are lay-
ers with different temperatures and densities; this
causes convection and turbulence. When the light
from a star passes through the unsteady air, rapid
changes in refraction in different directions re-
sult. Thus, the amount of light reaching a detec-
tor, e.g. the human eye, constantly varies; the star
is said to scintillate (Fig. 3.1). Planets shine more
steadily, since they are not point sources like the
stars, and variations in the light coming from dif-
ferent parts partly cancel each others.
When a wavefront passes an aperture its am-
plitude and phase vary with time. The amplitude
variations cause scintillation and phase changes
blur the image. A telescope collects light over
a larger area, which evens out rapid changes
and diminishes scintillation. Instead, differences
in the phase do not cancel out the same way;
they smear the image and point sources are seen
in telescopes as vibrating speckles. This phe-
nomenon is called seeing. When the exposure
time is at least a few seconds the light oscillates
in all directions, and the stellar image becomes a
round disk (Fig. 3.3). The diameter of the seeing
disk can vary from less than an arc second to even
tens of arc seconds. If the size of the disk small,
the seeing is good. It is only in good conditions
on high mountains that the seeing is less than one
arc second.
Seeing limits how small details can be seen
with a telescope. Sometimes the atmosphere can
calm down for a short period of time, and then it
is possible to glimpse visually details that are not
seen in pictures exposed for a longer time.
Some wavelength regions in the electromag-
netic spectrum are strongly absorbed by the atmo-
sphere (Fig. 3.2). The most important transparent

interval is the optical window from about 300 to
800 nm. This interval coincides with the region of
sensitivity of the human eye (about 400–700 nm).
At wavelengths under 300 nm absorption by
atmospheric ozone prevents radiation from reach-
ing the ground. The ozone is concentrated in
a thin layer at a height of about 20–30 km, and
this layer protects the Earth from harmful ultra-
violet radiation. At still shorter wavelengths, the
main absorbers are O2, N2 and free atoms. Nearly
all of the radiation under 300 nm is absorbed by
the upper parts of the atmosphere.
At wavelengths longer than visible light, in
the near-infrared region, the atmosphere is fairly
transparent up to 1.3 µm. There are some absorp-
tion belts caused by water and molecular oxy-
gen, but the atmosphere gets more opaque only
at wavelengths of longer than 1.3 µm. At these

Fig. 3.2 The transparency of the atmosphere at different
wavelengths. 100 % transmission means that all radiation
reaches the surface of the Earth. The radiation is also ab-
sorbed by interstellar gas, as shown in the lowermost very
schematic ﬁgure. The interstellar absorption also varies
very much depending on the direction (Chap. 15)

Observing Through the Atmosphere

Fig. 3.3 Stellar images vibrate about equally often in all
directions, on the average. If the picture is exposed for
more than about one second the image of the star spreads
into a circular seeing disc. The better the observing condi-
tions are the smaller is the diameter of the disc
wavelengths, radiation reaches the lower parts of
the atmosphere only in a few narrow windows.
All wavelengths between 20 µm and 1 mm are
totally absorbed.
At wavelengths longer than 1 mm, there is the
radio window extending up to about 20 m. At
still longer wavelengths, the ionosphere in the up-
per parts of the atmosphere reﬂects all radiation
(Fig. 3.2). The exact upper limit of the radio win-
dow depends on the strength of the ionosphere,
which varies during the day. (The structure of the
atmosphere is described in Chap. 7.)
At optical wavelengths (300–800 nm), light
is scattered by the molecules and dust in the at-
mosphere, and the radiation is attenuated. Scat-
tering and absorption together are called extinc-
tion. Extinction must be taken into account when
one measures the brightness of celestial bodies
(Chap. 4).
In the 19th century Lord Rayleigh succeeded
in explaining why the sky is blue. Scattering
caused by the molecules in the atmosphere is in-
versely proportional to the fourth power of the
wavelength. Thus, blue light is scattered more
than red light. The blue light we see all over the
sky is scattered sunlight. The same phenomenon

upper photo was taken in 1908, the lower one in 1988. The
lights of Los Angeles, Pasadena, Hollywood and more
than 40 other towns are reﬂected in the sky, causing con-
siderable disturbance to astronomical observations. (Pho-
tos by Ferdinand Ellerman and International Dark-Sky As-
sociation)
colours the setting sun red, because owing to the
long, oblique path through the atmosphere, all the
blue light has been scattered away.
In astronomy one often has to observe very
faint objects. Thus, it is important that the back-
ground sky be as dark as possible, and the atmo-
sphere as transparent as possible. That is why the
large observatories have been built on mountain
tops far from the cities. The air above an observa-
tory site must be very dry, the number of cloudy
nights few, and the seeing good.
Astronomers have looked all over the Earth for
optimal conditions and have found some excep-
tional sites. In the 1970’s, several new major ob-
servatories were founded at these sites. Among
the best sites in the world are: the extinct vol-
cano Mauna Kea on Hawaii, rising more than
4000 m above the sea; the dry mountains in north-
ern Chile; the Sonoran desert in the U.S., near
the border of Mexico; and the mountains on La
Palma, in the Canary Islands. Many older ob-
servatories are severely plagued by the lights of
nearby cities (Fig. 3.4).

Observations and Instruments
In radio astronomy atmospheric conditions are
not very critical except when observing at the
shortest wavelengths, damped by atmospheric
moisture. Constructors of radio telescopes have
much greater freedom in choosing their sites than
optical astronomers. Still, radio telescopes are
also often constructed in uninhabited places to
isolate them from disturbing radio and television
broadcasts.
3.2
Optical Telescopes
The telescope fulﬁls three major tasks in astro-
nomical observations:
1. It collects light from a large area, making it
possible to study very faint sources.
2. It improves resolution and increases the appar-
ent angular diameter of the object.
3. It is used to measure the positions of objects.
The light-collecting surface in a telescope
is either a lens or a mirror. Thus, optical tele-
scopes are divided into two types, lens telescopes
or refractors and mirror telescopes or reﬂectors
(Fig. 3.5).
Geometrical Optics
Refractors have two len-
ses, the objective which collects the incoming
light and forms an image in the focal plane, and
the eyepiece which is a small magnifying glass
for looking at the image (Fig. 3.5). The lenses
are at the opposite ends of a tube which can be
directed towards any desired point. The distance
Fig. 3.5 A lens telescope or refractor and a mirror tele-
scope or reﬂector
between the eyepiece and the focal plane can be
adjusted to get the image into focus. The image
formed by the objective lens can also be regis-
tered, e.g. on a photographic ﬁlm, as in an ordi-
nary camera.
The diameter of the objective, D, is called the
aperture of the telescope. The ratio of the aper-
ture D to the focal length f , F = D/f , is called
the aperture ratio. This quantity is used to charac-
terise the light-gathering power of the telescope.
If the aperture ratio is large, near unity, one has
a powerful, “fast” telescope; this means that one
can take photographs using short exposures, since
the image is bright. A small aperture ratio (the fo-
cal length much greater than the aperture) means
a “slow” telescope.
In astronomy, as in photography, the aperture
ratio is often denoted by f/n (e.g. f/8), where
n is the focal length divided by the aperture. For
fast telescopes this ratio can be f/1...f/3, but
usually it is smaller, f/8...f/15.
The scale of the image formed in the focal
plane of a refractor can be geometrically deter-
mined from Fig. 3.6. When the object is seen at
the angle u, it forms an image of height s,
s = f tanu ≈f u,
(3.1)
since u is a very small angle. If the telescope has
a focal length of, for instance, 343 cm, one arc
minute corresponds to
s = 343 cm × 1′
= 343 cm × (1/60) × (π/180)
= 1 mm.

object subtends an angle u. The objective forms an image
of the object in the focal plane. When the image is viewed
through the eyepiece, it is seen at an angle u′

Fig. 3.7 Diffraction and resolving power. The image of
a single star (a) consists of concentric diffraction rings,
which can be displayed as a mountain diagram (b). Wide
pairs of stars can be easily resolved (c). For resolving close
binaries, different criteria can be used. One is the Rayleigh
limit 1.22λ/D (d). In practice, the resolution can be writ-
ten λ/D, which is near the Dawes limit (e). (Photo (a) Sky
and Telescope)
The magniﬁcation ω is (from Fig. 3.6)
ω = u′/u ≈f/f ′,
(3.2)
where we have used the equation s = f u. Here,
f is the focal length of the objective and f ′ that
of the eyepiece. For example, if f = 100 cm and
we use an eyepiece with f ′ = 2 cm, the magni-
ﬁcation is 50-fold. The magniﬁcation is not an
essential feature of a telescope, since it can be
changed simply by changing the eyepiece.
A more important characteristic, which de-
pends on the aperture of the telescope, is the re-
solving power, which determines, for example,
the minimum angular separation of the compo-
nents of a binary star that can be seen as two sep-
arate stars. The theoretical limit for the resolution
is set by the diffraction of light: The telescope
does not form a point image of a star, but rather
a small disk, since light “bends around the cor-
ner” like all radiation (Fig. 3.7).
The theoretical resolution of a telescope is of-
ten given in the form introduced by Rayleigh (see
Box 3.1)
sinθ ≈θ = 1.22λ/D,
[θ] = rad.
(3.3)
As a practical rule, we can say that two objects
are seen as separate if the angular distance be-
tween them is
θ ≳λ/D,
[θ] = rad.
(3.4)
This formula can be applied to optical as well as
radio telescopes. For example, if one makes ob-
servations at a typical yellow wavelength (λ =
550 nm), the resolving power of a reﬂector with
an aperture of 1 m is about 0.1′′. However, seeing
spreads out the image to a diameter of typically
one arc second. Thus, the theoretical diffraction
limit cannot usually be reached on the surface of
the Earth.
In photography the resolution is further re-
stricted by the properties of the photographic
plate or the pixel size of the CCD camera, de-
creasing the resolution as compared with vi-
sual observations. The grain size of photographic
emulsions is about 0.01–0.03 mm, which is also
the minimum size of the image. For a focal length
of 1 m, the scale is 1 mm = 206′′, and thus
0.01 mm corresponds to about 2 arc seconds. This
is similar to the theoretical resolution of a tele-
scope with an aperture of 7 cm in visual obser-

56

vations. The pixel sizes of CCD cameras have
decreased, and currently the resolution can be as
good as or even better than the resolution of pho-
tographic ﬁlms.
In practice, the resolution of visual observa-
tions is determined by the ability of the eye to see
details. In night vision (when the eye is perfectly
adapted to darkness) the resolving capability of
the human eye is about 2′.
The maximum magniﬁcation ωmax is the
largest magniﬁcation that is worth using in tele-
scopic observations. Its value is obtained from
the ratio of the resolving capability of the eye,
e ≈2′ = 5.8 × 10−4 rad, to the resolving power
of the telescope, θ,
ωmax = e/θ ≈eD/λ = 5.8 × 10−4 D
5.5 × 10−7 m
≈D/1 mm.
(3.5)
If we use, for example, an objective with a di-
ameter of 100 mm, the maximum magniﬁcation
is about 100. If larger magniﬁcations are used
the object is seen bigger but no more details
are resolved. Especially small and cheap amateur
telescopes are advertised having huge magniﬁ-
cations, which are useless; rather they make ob-
serving very difﬁcult. However, experienced ob-
servers may sometimes use very big magniﬁca-
tions in some special occasions.
The minimum magniﬁcation ωmin is the small-
est magniﬁcation that is useful in visual observa-
tions. Its value is obtained from the condition that
the diameter of the exit pupil L of the telescope
must be smaller than or equal to the pupil of the
eye.
The exit pupil is the image of the objective
lens, formed by the eyepiece, through which the
light from the objective goes behind the eyepiece.
From Fig. 3.8 we obtain
L = f ′
f D = D
ω .
(3.6)
Thus the condition L ≤d means that
ω ≥D/d.

Fig. 3.9 Chromatic aberration. Light rays of different
colours are refracted to different focal points (left). The
aberration can be corrected with an achromatic lens con-
sisting of two parts (right)
In the night, the diameter of the pupil of the hu-
man eye is about 6 mm, and thus the minimum
magniﬁcation of a 100 mm telescope is about 17.
Refractors
In the ﬁrst refractors, which had
a simple objective lens, the observations were
hampered by the chromatic aberration. Since
glass refracts different colours by different
amounts, all colours do not meet at the same fo-
cal point (Fig. 3.9), but the focal length increases
with increasing wavelength. To remove this aber-
ration, achromatic lenses consisting of two parts
were developed in the 18th century. The colour
dependence of the focal length is much smaller
than in single lenses, and at some wavelength, λ0,
the focal length has an extremum (usually a min-
imum). Near this point the change of focal length
with wavelength is very small (Fig. 3.10). If the
telescope is intended for visual observations, we
choose λ0 = 550 nm, corresponding to the maxi-
mum sensitivity of the eye. Objectives for photo-
graphic refractors were usually constructed with
λ0 ≈425 nm, since normal photographic plates
were most sensitive to the blue part of the spec-
trum.

Fig. 3.10 The wavelength dependence of the focal length
of a typical achromatic objective for visual observations.
The focal length has a minimum near λ = 550 nm, where
the eye is most sensitive. In bluer light (λ = 450 nm) or
in redder light (λ = 800 nm), the focal length increases by
a factor of about 1.002
By combining three or even more lenses of dif-
ferent glasses in the objective, the chromatic aber-
ration can be corrected still better (as in apochro-
matic objectives). Also, special glasses have been
developed where the wavelength dependences of
the refractive index cancel out so well that two
lenses already give a very good correction of the
chromatic aberration. They have, however, hardly
been used in astronomy so far.
The largest refractors in the world have an
aperture of about one metre (102 cm in the Yerkes
Observatory telescope (Fig. 3.11), ﬁnished in
1897, and 91 cm in the Lick Observatory tele-
scope (1888)). The aperture ratio is typically
f/10...f/20.
The use of refractors is limited by their small
ﬁeld of view and awkwardly long structure. Re-
fractors are still used, e.g. in solar telescopes and
various meridian telescopes for measuring the po-
sitions of stars, and also for visual observations of
binary stars.
A wider ﬁeld of view is obtained by using
more complex lens systems, and telescopes of
this kind are called astrographs. Astrographs
have an objective made up of typically 3–5 lenses
and an aperture of less than 60 cm. The aperture
ratio is f/5...f/7 and the ﬁeld of view about 5◦.
Astrographs are used to photograph large areas of
the sky, e.g. for proper motion studies and for sta-
tistical brightness studies of the stars.
Reﬂectors
By far the most common telescope
type in astrophysical research nowadays is the
mirror telescope or reﬂector. As a light-collecting
surface, it employs a mirror coated with a thin
layer of aluminium. The form of the mirror is usu-
ally parabolic. A parabolic mirror reﬂects all light
rays entering the telescope parallel to the main
axis into the same focal point. The image formed
at this point can be observed through an eyepiece
or registered with a detector. One of the advan-
tages of reﬂectors is the absence of chromatic
aberration, since all wavelengths are reﬂected to
the same point.
In the very largest telescopes, the instruments
can be installed at the primary focus (Fig. 3.12)
without eclipsing too much of the incoming light.
Sometimes even the observer could sit in a cage
at the primary focus. In smaller telescopes, this
is not possible, and the image must be inspected
from outside the telescope. In modern telescopes
instruments are remotely controlled, and the ob-
server must stay away from the telescope to re-
duce thermal turbulence.
The idea of a reﬂector was described in 1663
by James Gregory. The ﬁrst practical reﬂector,
however, was built by Isaac Newton. He guided
the light perpendicularly out from the telescope
with a small ﬂat mirror. Therefore the focus of
the image in such a system is called the New-
ton focus. A typical aperture ratio of a Newtonian
telescope is f/3...f/10. Another possibility is
to bore a hole at the centre of the primary mirror
and reﬂect the rays through it with a small hy-
perbolic secondary mirror in the front end of the
telescope. In such a design, the rays meet in the
Cassegrain focus. Cassegrain systems have aper-
ture ratios of f/8...f/15.
The effective focal length (fe) of a Cassegrain
telescope is determined by the position and con-
vexity of the secondary mirror. Using the nota-
tions of Fig. 3.13, we get
fe = b
a fp.
(3.8)
If we choose a ≪b, we have fe ≫fp. In this
way one can construct short telescopes with long
focal lengths. Cassegrain systems are especially
well suited for spectrographic, photometric and

other instruments, which can be mounted in the
secondary focus, easily accessible to the observer.
More complicated arrangements use several
mirrors to guide the light through the declination
axis of the telescope to a ﬁxed coudé focus (from
the French word couder, to bend), which can even
be situated in a separate room near the telescope
(Fig. 3.14). The focal length is thus very long
and the aperture ratio f/30...f/40. The coudé
focus is used mainly for accurate spectroscopy,

since the large spectrographs can be stationary
and their temperature can be held accurately con-
stant. Nowadays this can also be achieved by us-
ing optical ﬁbers. A drawback is that much light
is lost in the reﬂections in the several mirrors
of the coudé system. An aluminised mirror re-
ﬂects about 80 % of the light falling on it, and
thus in a coudé system of, e.g. ﬁve mirrors (in-
cluding the primary and secondary mirrors), only

cave (paraboloid) primary mirror M1 reﬂects the light rays
parallel to the main axis towards the primary focus S1.
A convex secondary mirror M2 (hyperboloid) reﬂects the
rays back through a small hole at the centre of the main
mirror to the secondary focus S2 outside the telescope
0.85 ≈30 % of the light reaches the detector. In
new big telescopes the large instruments are usu-
ally mounted at the Nasmyth focus at the end of
the horizontal axis of the telescope.
The reﬂector has its own aberration, coma. It
affects images displaced from the optical axis.
Light rays do not converge at one point, but form
a ﬁgure like a comet. Due to the coma, the clas-
sical reﬂector with a paraboloid mirror has a very
small correct ﬁeld of view. The coma limits the
diameter of the useful ﬁeld to 2–20 minutes of
arc, depending on the aperture ratio of the tele-
scope. The 5 m Palomar telescope, for instance,
has a useful ﬁeld of view of about 4′, correspond-
ing to about one-eighth of the diameter of the
Moon. In practice, the small ﬁeld of view can be
enlarged by various correcting lenses.
If the primary mirror were spherical, there
would be no coma. However, this kind of mir-
ror has its own error, spherical aberration: light
rays from the centre and edges converge at dif-
ferent points. To remove the spherical aberration,
the Estonian astronomer Bernhard Schmidt de-
veloped a thin correcting lens that is placed in
Fig. 3.14 The coudé system of the Kitt Peak 2.1 m reﬂector. (Drawing National Optical Astronomy Observatories, Kitt
Peak National Observatory)

the way of the incoming light. Schmidt cameras
(Figs. 3.15 and 3.16) have a very wide (about 7◦),
nearly faultless ﬁeld of view, and the correcting
lens is so thin that it absorbs very little light. The
images of the stars are very sharp. In Schmidt
telescopes the diaphragm with the correcting lens
is positioned at the centre of the radius of curva-
ture of the mirror (this radius equals twice the fo-
cal length). To collect all the light from the edges
of the ﬁeld of view, the diameter of the mirror
must be larger than that of the correcting glass.
The Palomar Schmidt camera, for example, has
an aperture of 122 cm (correcting lens)/183 cm
(mirror) and a focal length of 300 cm. The largest
Schmidt telescope in the world is in Tauten-
burg, Germany, and its corresponding values are
134/203/400 cm.
A disadvantage of the Schmidt telescope is
the curved focal plane, consisting of a part of
a sphere. When the telescope is used for pho-
tography, the plate must be bent along the curved
focal plane. Another possibility of correcting the
curvature of the ﬁeld of view is to use an extra
correcting lens near the focal plane. Such a so-
lution was developed by the Finnish astronomer
Yrjö Väisälä in the 1930’s, independently of
Schmidt. Such a system is often called a Schmidt–
Fig. 3.15 The principle of the Schmidt camera. A cor-
recting glass at the centre of curvature of a concave spher-
ical mirror deviates parallel rays of light and compensates
for the spherical aberration of the spherical mirror. (In the
ﬁgure, the form of the correcting glass and the change of
direction of the light rays have been greatly exaggerated.)
Since the correcting glass lies at the centre of curvature,
the image is practically independent of the incoming an-
gle of the light rays. Thus there is no coma or astigmatism,
and the images of stars are points on a spherical surface
at a distance of R/2, where R is the radius of curvature
of the spherical mirror. In photography, the plate must be
bent into the form of the focal surface, or the ﬁeld rectiﬁed
with a corrector lens
Väisälä telescope. The chips of CCD cameras are
usually much smaller than photographic plates,
and then the curved focal surface is not a prob-
lem.
Schmidt cameras have proved to be very ef-
fective in mapping the sky. They have been used
to photograph the Palomar Sky Atlas mentioned
in the previous chapter and its continuation, the
ESO/SRC Southern Sky Atlas.
The Schmidt camera is an example of a cata-
dioptric telescope, which has both lenses and
mirrors. Schmidt–Cassegrain telescopes used by
many amateurs are modiﬁcations of the Schmidt
camera. They have a secondary mirror mounted
at the centre of the correcting lens; the mirror re-
ﬂects the image through a hole in the primary mir-
ror. Thus the effective focal length can be rather
long, although the telescope itself is very short.
Another common catadioptric telescope is the
Maksutov telescope. Both surfaces of the correct-
ing lens as well as the primary mirror of a Mak-
sutov telescope are concentric spheres.
Another way of removing the coma of the
classical reﬂectors is to use more complicated
mirror surfaces. The Ritchey–Chrétien system
has hyperboloidal primary and secondary mir-
rors, providing a fairly wide useful ﬁeld of view.
Ritchey–Chrétien optics are used in many large
telescopes.
Mountings of Telescopes
A telescope has to be
mounted on a steady support to prevent its shak-
ing, and it must be smoothly rotated during obser-
vations. There are two principal types of mount-
ing, equatorial and azimuthal (Fig. 3.17).
In the equatorial mounting, one of the axes is
directed towards the celestial pole. It is called the
polar axis or hour axis. The other one, the decli-
nation axis, is perpendicular to it. Since the hour
axis is parallel to the axis of the Earth, the appar-
ent rotation of the sky can be compensated for by
turning the telescope around this axis at a con-
stant rate.
The declination axis is the main technical
problem of the equatorial mounting. When the
telescope is pointing to the south its weight
causes a force perpendicular to the axis. When
the telescope is tracking an object and turns west-

ward, the bearings must take an increasing load
parallel with the declination axis.
In the azimuthal mounting, one of the axes is
vertical, the other one horizontal. This mounting
is easier to construct than the equatorial mount-
ing and is more stable for very large telescopes.
In order to follow the rotation of the sky, the tele-
scope must be turned around both of the axes
with changing velocities. The ﬁeld of view will
also rotate; this rotation must be compensated for
when the telescope is used for photography.
If an object goes close to the zenith, its az-
imuth will change 180◦in a very short time.
Therefore, around the zenith there is a small re-
gion where observations with an azimuthal tele-
scope are not possible.
The largest telescopes in the world were equa-
torially mounted until the development of com-
puters made possible the more complicated guid-
ance needed for azimuthal mountings. Most of
the recently built large telescopes are already az-
imuthally mounted. Azimuthally mounted tele-
scopes have two additional obvious places for
foci, the Nasmyth foci at both ends of the hori-
zontal axis.
The Dobson mounting, used in many amateur
telescopes, is azimuthal. The magniﬁcation of the
Newtonian telescope is usually small, and the
telescope rests on pieces of teﬂon, which make
it very easy to move. Thus the object can easily
be tracked manually.

Another type of mounting is the coelostat,
where rotating mirrors guide the light into a sta-
tionary telescope. This system is used especially
in solar telescopes.
To measure absolute positions of stars and ac-
curate time, telescopes aligned with the north–
south direction are used. They can be rotated
around one axis only, the east–west horizontal
axis. Meridian circles or transit instruments with
this kind of mounting were widely constructed
for different observatories during the 19th cen-
tury. A few are still used for astrometry, but they
are now highly automatic. The most important of
the still operational instruments is that of the U.S.
Naval Observatory in Flagstaff. The meridian cir-
cle on La Palma funded by the Carlsberg founda-
tion was closed in 2013.
New Techniques
Detectors are already ap-
proaching the theoretical limit of efﬁciency,
where all incident photons are registered. Ulti-
mately, to detect even fainter objects the only
solution is to increase the light gathering area
(Fig. 3.18), but also the mirrors are getting close
to the practical maximum size. Thus, new techni-
cal solutions are needed.
One new feature is active optics, used in most
new big telescopes. The mirror is very thin, but its
shape is kept exactly correct by a computer con-
trolled support mechanism. The weight and pro-
duction cost of such a mirror are much smaller
compared with a conventional thick mirror. Be-
cause of the smaller weight also the supporting
structure can be made lighter.
Developing the control mechanism further
leads to adaptive optics. A reference star (or an
artiﬁcial beam) is monitored constantly in order
to obtain the shape of the seeing disk. The attitude
or the shape of a small auxiliary mirror is adjusted
up to hundreds of times a second to keep the im-
age as concentrated as possible. Adaptive optics
has been taken into use in the largest telescopes
of the world from about the year 2000 on.
The mirrors of large telescopes need not be
monolithic, but can be made of smaller pieces
that are, e.g. hexagonal. These mosaic mirrors
are very light and can be used to build up mir-
rors with diameters of several tens of metres
(Fig. 3.20). Using active optics, the hexagons can
be accurately focused. The California Associa-
tion for Research in Astronomy has constructed
the William M. Keck telescope with a 10 m mo-

saic mirror. It is located on Mauna Kea, and the
last segment was installed in 1992. Also the E-
ELT telescope (Fig. 3.21) planned by ESO will
have a mosaic mirror.
The reﬂecting surface does not have to be con-
tinuous, but can even consist of several separate
telescopes. Next to the Keck another similar tele-
scope, the Keck II, was completed in 1996. The
pair can be used as an interferometer that has the
same resolving power as a single 75 metre mir-
ror.
The European Southern Observatory has con-
structed its own multi-mirror telescope. ESO’s
Very Large Telescope (VLT) has four closely lo-
cated telescopes (Fig. 3.19). The diameter of each
mirror is eight metres, and the total area corre-
sponds to one telescope with a 16 m mirror. The
resolution is even better, since the “aperture”, i.e.
the maximum distance between the mirrors, is
several tens of meters.
An important astronomical instruments of the
20th century is the Hubble Space Telescope,
launched in 1990 (Fig. 3.22). It has a mirror with
a diameter of 2.4 m. The resolution of the tele-
scope (after the faulty optics was corrected) is
near the theoretical diffraction limit, since there
is no disturbing atmosphere. A second genera-
tion Space Telescope, now called the James Webb
Space Telescope, will have a mosaic mirror of
6.5 m. The launch has been postponed mainly for
ﬁnancial reasons. The current estimates for the
launch are around 2018.

Space telescopes avoid the atmospheric per-
turbations. However, comparable results are
nowadays obtained using the adaptive optics. Due
to budgetary reasons, the majority of astronomi-
cal observations will still be carried out on the
Earth, and great attention will be given to improv-
ing ground-based observatories and detectors.
In the future, satellites will continue to be
mainly used for those wavelength regions where
the radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere.

Detectors and Instruments
Only a limited amount of information can be ob-
tained by looking through a telescope with the
unaided eye. Yet until the end of the 19th cen-
tury this was the only way to make observations.
The invention of photography in the middle of
the 19th century brought a revolution in astron-
omy. The next important step forward in optical
astronomy was the development of photoelectric
photometry in the 1940’s and 1950’s. A new revo-
lution, comparable to that caused by the invention
of photography, took place in the middle of the
1970’s with the introduction of different semicon-
ductor detectors. The sensitivity of detectors has
grown so much that today, a 60 cm telescope can
be used for observations similar to those made
with the Palomar 5 m telescope when it was set
in operation in the 1940’s.

The Photographic Plate
Photography has long
been one of the most common methods of obser-
vation in astronomy. In astronomical photogra-
phy glass plates were used, rather than ﬁlm, since
they keep their shape better, but nowadays they
are no more manufactured, and CCD-cameras
have largely replaced photography. The sensitive
layer on the surface of the ﬁlm or plate is made up
of a silver halide, usually silver bromide, AgBr.
A photon absorbed by the halide excites an elec-
tron that can move from one atom to another.
A silver ion, Ag+, can catch the electron, becom-
ing a neutral atom. When the necessary amount
of silver atoms have been accumulated at one
place, they form a latent image. The latent image
can be made into a permanent negative by treat-
ing the plate after exposure with various chemi-
cals, which transform the silver bromide crystals
enclosing the latent image into silver (“develop-
ment”), and remove the unexposed crystals (“ﬁx-
ing”).
The photographic plate has many advantages
over the human eye. The plate can register up to
millions of stars (picture elements) at one time,
while the eye can observe at most one or two
objects at a time. The image on a plate is prac-
tically permanent—the picture can be studied at
any time. In addition, the photographic plate is
cheap and easy to use, as compared to many other
detectors. The most important feature of a plate
is its capability to collect light over an extended
time: the longer exposures are used, the more sil-

ver atoms are formed on the plate (the plate dark-
ens). By increasing the exposure times, fainter
objects can be photographed. The eye has no such
capacity: if a faint object does not show through
a telescope, it cannot been seen, no matter how
long one stares.

One disadvantage of the photographic plate is
its low sensitivity. Only one photon in a thou-
sand causes a reaction leading to the formation
of a silver grain. Thus the quantum efﬁciency of
the plate is only 0.1 %. Several chemical treat-
ments can be used to sensitise the plate before
exposure. This brings the quantum efﬁciency up
to a few percent. Another disadvantage is the fact
that a silver bromide crystal that has been ex-
posed once does not register anything more, i.e.
a saturation point is reached. On the other hand,
a certain number of photons are needed to pro-
duce an image. Doubling the number of pho-
tons does not necessarily double the density (the
‘blackness’ of the image): the density of the plate
depends nonlinearly on the amount of incoming
light (Fig. 3.23). The sensitivity of the plate is
also strongly dependent on the wavelength of the
light. For the reasons mentioned above the ac-
curacy with which brightness can be measured

(Overwhelmingly Large telescope), but when the price
turned out to be “astronomical” the size has been reduced
several times. When the E-ELT telescope (European Ex-
tremely Large Telescope) will be completed the main mir-
ror will have a diameter of 39 metres. The mirror will con-
sist of 798 hexagonal pieces, each having a diameter of
1.45 metres. (ESO)

on a photographic plate is usually worse than
about 5 %. Thus the photographic plate makes
a poor photometer, but it can be excellently used,
e.g. for measuring the positions of stars (posi-
tional astronomy) and for mapping the sky. Old
photography archives are still valuable for study-
ing proper motions and brightness variations that
are not too minuscule.
Photocathodes,
Photomultipliers
A
photo-
cathode is a more effective detector than the pho-
tographic plate. It is based on the photoelectric
effect. A light quantum, or photon, hits the pho-
tocathode and loosens an electron. The electron
moves to the positive electrode, or anode, and
gives rise to an electric current that can be mea-
sured. The quantum efﬁciency of a photocathode

pends on the incident light. If there is very little light it has
no effect. Even then the ﬁlm is not completely transparent
since it has a light background fog. When the amount of
light increases the density will begin to grow ﬁrst nonlin-
early. When the exposure is optimal, which depends of the
type of the ﬁlm, the dependence of the density on exposure
is nearly linear. When there is too much light, all grains of
the ﬁlm become dark and the image is saturated
is about 10–20 times better than that of a pho-
tographic plate; optimally, an efﬁciency of 30 %
can be reached. A photocathode is also a linear
detector: if the number of electrons is doubled,
the outcoming current is also doubled.
The photomultiplier is one of the most impor-
tant applications of the photocathode. In this de-
vice, the electrons leaving the photocathode hit
a dynode. For each electron hitting the dynode,
several others are released. When there are sev-
eral dynodes in a row, the original weak current
can be intensiﬁed a millionfold. The photomulti-
plier measures all the light entering it, but does
not form an image. Photomultipliers are mostly
used in photometry, and an accuracy of 0.1–1 %
can be attained.
Photometers, Polarimeters
A detector mea-
suring brightness, a photometer, is usually lo-
cated behind the telescope in the Cassegrain fo-
cus. In the focal plane there is a small hole, the di-
aphragm, which lets through light from the object
under observation. In this way, light from other
stars in the ﬁeld of view can be prevented from
entering the photometer. A ﬁeld lens behind the
diaphragm refracts the light rays onto a photo-
cathode. The outcoming current is intensiﬁed fur-
Fig. 3.24 The principle of a photoelectric multicolour
photometer. Light collected by the telescope arrives from
the left. The light enters the photometer through a small
hole in the focal plane, the diaphragm. A lens collimates
the light into a parallel beam. Semitransparent mirrors di-
vide the beam to several photomultipliers. A ﬁeld lens
guides the light through a ﬁlter onto the photocathode of
the photomultiplier. The quanta of light, photons, release
electrons from the cathodes. The electrons are accelerated
towards the dynodes with a voltage of about 1500 V. The
electrons hitting the dynodes release still more electrons,
and the current is greatly enhanced. Every electron emit-
ted from the cathode gives rise to a pulse of up to 108 elec-
trons at the anode; the pulse is ampliﬁed and registered by
a pulse counter. In this way, the photons from the star are
counted
ther in a preampliﬁer. The photomultiplier needs
a voltage of 1000–1500 volts.
Observations are often made in a certain wave-
length interval, instead of measuring all the ra-
diation entering the detector. In this case a ﬁlter
is used to prevent other wavelengths from reach-
ing the photomultiplier. A photometer can also
consist of several photomultipliers (Fig. 3.23),
which measure simultaneously different wave-
length bands. In such an instrument beam split-
ters or semitransparent mirrors split the light
beam through ﬁxed ﬁlters to the photomultipliers.
In a device called the photopolarimeter, a po-
larising ﬁlter is used, either alone or in combina-
tion with other ﬁlters. The degree and direction of
polarisation can be found by measuring the inten-
sity of the radiation with different orientations of
the polarisers.
In practice, the diaphragm of a photometer
will always also let through part of the back-
ground sky around the observed object. The mea-
sured brightness is in reality the combined bright-
ness of the object and the sky. In order to ﬁnd the

70

Observations and Instruments
brightness of the object, the background bright-
ness must be measured separately and subtracted
from the combined brightness. The accuracy of
the measurements is decreased if long observa-
tion times are used and the background bright-
ness undergoes fast changes. The problem can be
solved by observing the brightness of the back-
ground sky and the object simultaneously.
Photometric observations are often relative. If
one is observing, e.g. a variable star, a reference
star close to the actual target is observed at regu-
lar intervals. Using the observations of this ref-
erence star it is possible to derive a model for
the slow changes in the atmospheric extinction
(see Chap. 4) and remove their effect. The instru-
ment can be calibrated by observing some stan-
dard stars, whose brightness is known very accu-
rately.
Image Intensiﬁers
Different image intensiﬁers
based on the photocathode have been used since
the 1960’s. In the intensiﬁer the information
about the starting point of the electron on the pho-
tocathode is preserved and the intensiﬁed image
is formed on a ﬂuorescent screen. The image can
then be registered, e.g. with a CCD camera. One
of the advantages of the image intensiﬁer is that
even faint objects can be imaged using relatively
short exposures, and observations can be made at
wavelengths where the detector is insensitive.
Another common type of detector is based on
the TV camera (Vidicon camera). The electrons
released from the photocathode are accelerated
with a voltage of a few kilovolts before they hit
the electrode where they form an image in the
form of an electric charge distribution. After ex-
posure, the charge at different points of the elec-
trode is read by scanning its surface with an elec-
tron beam row by row. This produces a video sig-
nal, which can be transformed into a visible im-
age on a TV tube. The information can also be
saved in digital form. In the most advanced sys-
tems, the scintillations caused by single electrons
on the ﬂuorescent screen of the image intensi-
ﬁer can be registered and stored in the memory
of a computer. For each point in the image there
is a memory location, called a picture element or
pixel.
Since the middle of the 1970’s, detectors using
semiconductor techniques began to be used in in-
creasing numbers. With semiconductor detectors
a quantum efﬁciency of about 70–80 % can be at-
tained; thus, sensitivity cannot be improved much
more. The wavelength regions suitable for these
new detectors are much wider than in the case of
the photographic plate. The detectors are also lin-
ear: if the number of photons is doubled, also the
signal will be doubled. Computers are used for
collecting, saving and analysing the output data
available in digital form.
CCD Camera
Currently the most important
detector is the CCD camera (Charge Coupled De-
vice). The detector consists of a surface made
up of light sensitive silicon diodes, arranged in
a rectangular array of image elements or pix-
els. The largest cameras can have as many as
4096 × 4096 pixels, although most are consid-
erably smaller. Recently, CCD’s have become
widely used in ordinary digital cameras.
A photon hitting the detector can release
an electron, which will remain trapped inside
a pixel. After the exposure varying potential
differences are used to move the accumulated
charges row by row to a readout buffer. In the
buffer the charges are moved pixel by pixel to
an analogy/digital converter, which transmits the
digital value to a computer. Reading an image
also clears the detector (Fig. 3.24). If the expo-
sures are very short the readout times may take
a substantial part of the observing time.
The CCD camera is nearly linear: the number
of electrons is directly proportional to the num-
ber of photons. Calibration of the data is there-
fore much easier than with photographic plates
(Fig. 3.25).
The quantum efﬁciency, i.e. the number of
electrons per incident photon, is high, and the
CCD camera is much more sensitive than a pho-
tographic plate. The sensitivity is highest in the
red wavelength range, about 600–800 nm, where
the quantum efﬁciency can be 80–90 % or even
higher.
The range of the camera extends far to the in-
frared. In the ultraviolet the sensitivity drops due
to the absorption of the silicon very rapidly be-
low about 500 nm. Two methods have been used

3.3

Fig. 3.25 The principle of reading a CCD camera.
(a) During an exposure electrons are trapped in potential
wells corresponding to pixels of the camera. The number
at each pixel shows the number of electrons. (b) After
the exposure each horizontal line is moved one pixel to
the right; the rightmost row moves to the readout buffer.
(c) The contents of the buffer is moved down by one pixel.
The lowermost charge moves to the A/D converter, which
sends the number of electrons to the computer. (d) Af-
ter moving the buffer down several times one vertical row
has been read. (e) The image is again shifted right by one
pixel. This procedure is repeated till the whole image is
read
to avoid this problem. One is to use a coating that
absorbs the ultraviolet photons and emits light of
longer wavelength. Another possibility is to turn
the chip upside down and make it very thin to re-
duce the absorption.
The thermal noise of the camera generates
dark current even if the camera is in total dark-
ness. To reduce the noise the camera must be
cooled. Astronomical CCD cameras are usually
cooled with liquid nitrogen, which efﬁciently re-
moves most of the dark current. However, the
sensitivity is also reduced when the camera is
cooled; so too cold is not good either. The tem-
perature must be kept constant in order to obtain
consistent data. For amateurs there are already
moderately priced CCD cameras, which are elec-
trically cooled. Many of them are good enough
also for scientiﬁc work, if very high sensitivity is
not required.
The dark current can easily be measured by
taking exposures with the shutter closed. Sub-
tracting this from the observed image gives the
real number of electrons due to incident light
(Fig. 3.26).
Fig. 3.26 The signal measured by a CCD-camera de-
pends almost linearly on the number of photons. During
the exposure also the dark current will increase and has to
be subtracted from the observed values. Bias is the dark
current registered even if the exposure time were zero
The sensitivity of individual pixels may be
slightly different. This can be corrected for by
taking an image of an evenly illuminated ﬁeld,
like a twilight sky, where stars are not visible.
This image is called a ﬂat-ﬁeld. When observa-
tions are divided by the ﬂat-ﬁeld, the error caused
by different pixels is removed (Fig. 3.27).

raw image and bottom right reduced image
The CCD camera is very stable. Therefore it is
not necessary to repeat the dark current and ﬂat-
ﬁeld observations very frequently. Typically these
calibration exposures are taken during evening
and morning twilights, just before and after ac-
tual observations.
Cosmic rays are charged particles that can pro-
duce extraneous bright dots in CCD images. They
are usually limited to one or two pixels, and are
easily identiﬁed. Typically a short exposure of
a few minutes contains a few traces of cosmic
rays. Instead of a single long exposure it is usu-
ally better to take several short ones, clean the im-
ages from cosmic rays, and ﬁnally add the images
on a computer.
A more serious problem is the readout noise
of the electronics. In the ﬁrst cameras it could
be hundreds of electrons per pixel. In modern
cameras it is a few electrons. This gives a limit
to the faintest detectable signal: if the signal is
weaker than the readout noise, it is indistinguish-
able from the noise. Nowadays there are so called

3.3
Detectors and Instruments
73
L3-cameras (low light level CCD), where elec-
trons are multiplied during reading and the read-
out noise is the only source of noise.
Although the CCD camera is a very sensi-
tive detector, even bright light cannot damage it.
A photomultiplier, on the other hand, can be eas-
ily destroyed by letting in too much light. How-
ever, one pixel can only store a certain number of
electrons, after which it becomes saturated. Ex-
cessive saturation can make the charge to over-
ﬂow also to the neighbouring pixels. If the camera
becomes badly saturated it may have to be read
several times to completely remove the charges.
The largest CCD cameras are quite expensive,
and even they are still rather small compared
with the largest photographic plates and ﬁlms.
Because they are very sensitive and processing
of the data is easy, they have, however, replaced
photographic materials almost completely.
Spectrographs
The simplest spectrograph is
a prism that is placed in front of a telescope.
This kind of device is called the objective prism
spectrograph. The prism spreads out the different
wavelengths of light into a spectrum which can
be registered. During the exposure, the telescope
is usually slightly moved perpendicularly to the
spectrum, in order to increase the width of the
spectrum. With an objective prism spectrograph,
large numbers of spectra can be photographed,
e.g. for spectral classiﬁcation (Chap. 9).
For more accurate information the slit spec-
trograph must be used (Fig. 3.28). It has a nar-
row slit in the focal plane of the telescope. The
light is guided through the slit to a collimator
that reﬂects or refracts all the light rays into
a parallel beam. After this, the light is dispersed
into a spectrum by a prism and focused with
a camera onto a detector, which nowadays is usu-
ally a CCD camera. A comparison spectrum is
exposed next to the stellar spectrum to deter-
mine the precise wavelengths. In modern spec-
trographs using CCD cameras, the comparison
spectrum is usually exposed as a separate im-
age. A big slit spectrograph is often placed at the
coudé or Nasmyth focus of the telescope.
The most important property of a spectrograph
is the scale or dispersion of the spectrum. The dis-
Fig. 3.28 The principle of the slit spectrograph. Light
rays entering through a slit are collimated (made paral-
lel to each other), dispersed into a spectrum by a prism
and projected onto a photographic plate or a CCD. There
can also be several prisms. However, grids are used more
commonly since they give a better resolution
persion tells how long a wavelength range cor-
responds to one distance unit of the detector.
For the objective prism the dispersion is typi-
cally a few tens of nanometres per millimetre. Slit
spectrographs may have a dispersion as high as
1–0.01 nm/mm, which makes it possible to study
even the shapes of individual spectral lines. Often
the dispersion is given as a dimensionless quan-
tity. For instance, the dispersion 1 nm/mm means
that the wavelength scale has increased million-
fold; thus it can be expressed as 106.
Instead of the prism a diffraction grating can
be used to form the spectrum. A grating has nar-
row grooves, side by side, typically several hun-
dred per millimetre. When light is reﬂected by
the walls of the grooves, the adjoining rays in-
terfere with each other and give rise to spectra of
different orders. There are two kinds of gratings:
reﬂection and transmission gratings. In a reﬂec-
tion grating no light is absorbed by the glass as in
the prism or transmission grating. A grating usu-
ally has higher dispersion, or ability to spread the
spectrum, than a prism. The dispersion can be in-
creased by increasing the density of the grooves
of the grating. In slit spectrographs the reﬂection
grating is most commonly used. In some instru-
ments a grism is used; it is a prism with a trans-
mission grating on one of its surfaces.
Interferometers
The resolution of a big tele-
scope is in practice limited by seeing, and thus
increasing the aperture does not necessarily im-
prove the resolution. To get nearer to the theoret-
ical resolution limit set by diffraction (Eq. (3.3),
Fig. 3.6), different interferometers can be used.

74
3
Observations and Instruments
There are two types of optical interferome-
ters. One kind uses an existing large telescope;
the other a system of two or more separate tele-
scopes. In both cases the light rays are allowed
to interfere. By analysing the outcoming interfer-
ence pattern, the structures of close binaries can
be studied, apparent angular diameters of the stars
can be measured, etc.
One of the earliest interferometers was the
Michelson interferometer that was built shortly
before 1920 for the largest telescope of that time.
In front of the telescope, at the ends of a six me-
tre long beam, there were ﬂat mirrors reﬂecting
the light into the telescope. The form of the inter-
ference pattern changed when the separation of
the mirrors was changed. In practice, the inter-
ference pattern was disturbed by seeing, and only
a few positive results were obtained with this in-
strument.
The diameters of over 30 of the brightest stars
have been measured using intensity interferome-
ters. Such a device consists of two separate tele-
scopes that can be moved in relation to each other.
This method is suitable for the brightest objects
only.
In 1970 the Frenchman Antoine Labeyrie in-
troduced the principle of speckle interferometry.
In traditional imaging the pictures from long ex-
posures consist of a large number of instanta-
neous images, “speckles”, that together form the
seeing disk. In speckle interferometry very short
exposures and large magniﬁcations are used and
hundreds of pictures are taken. When these pic-
tures are combined and analysed (usually in dig-
ital form), the actual resolution of the telescope
can nearly be reached.
The accuracy of interferometric techniques
was improved at the beginning of 00’s. The ﬁrst
experiments to use the two 10 m Keck telescopes
as one interferometer, were made in 2001. Simi-
larly, the ESO VLT can be used as an interferom-
eter.
3.4
Radio Telescopes
Radio astronomy, started in the 1930’s, extended
the observable range of the electromagnetic spec-
trum by several orders of magnitude. Radio fre-
quencies range from a few megahertz (100 m)
up to about 300 GHz (1 mm). The low-frequency
limit of the radio band is determined by the opac-
ity of the ionosphere, while the high-frequency
limit is due to the strong absorption from oxy-
gen and water bands in the lower atmosphere.
Neither of these limits is very strict, and un-
der favourable conditions radio astronomers can
work into the submillimetre region or through
ionospheric holes during sunspot minima.
At the beginning of the 20th century attempts
were made to observe radio emission from the
Sun. These experiments, however, failed because
of the low sensitivity of the antenna–receiver sys-
tems, and because of the opaqueness of the iono-
sphere at the low frequencies at which most of
the experiments were carried out. The ﬁrst ob-
servations of cosmic radio emission were later
made by the American engineer Karl G. Jansky
in 1932, while studying thunderstorm radio dis-
turbances at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (14.6 m).
He discovered radio emission of unknown ori-
gin, which varied within a 24 hour period. Some-
what later he identiﬁed the source of this radi-
ation to be in the direction of the centre of our
Galaxy.
The real birth of radio astronomy may perhaps
be dated to the late 1930’s, when Grote Reber
started systematic observations with his home-
made 9.5 m paraboloid antenna. Thereafter ra-
dio astronomy developed quite rapidly and has
greatly improved our knowledge of the Universe.
Observations are made both in the contin-
uum (broad band) and in spectral lines (radio
spectroscopy). Much of our knowledge about the
structure of our Milky Way comes from radio ob-
servations of the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen
and, more recently, from the 2.6 mm line of the
carbon monoxide molecule. Radio astronomy has
resulted in many important discoveries; e.g. both
pulsars and quasars were ﬁrst found by radio as-
tronomical observations. The importance of the
ﬁeld can also be seen from the fact that the Nobel
prize in physics has recently been awarded three
times to radio astronomers.
A radio telescope collects radiation in an aper-
ture or antenna, from which it is transformed to
an electric signal by a receiver, called a radiome-

3.4

75
ter. This signal is then ampliﬁed, detected and
integrated, and the output is registered on some
recording device, nowadays usually by a com-
puter. Because the received signal is very weak,
one has to use sensitive receivers. These are often
cooled to minimise the noise, which could other-
wise mask the signal from the source. Because ra-
dio waves are electromagnetic radiation, they are
reﬂected and refracted like ordinary light waves.
In radio astronomy, however, only reﬂecting tele-
scopes are used.
At low frequencies the antennas are usually
dipoles (similar to those used for radio or TV),
but in order to increase the collecting area and
improve the resolution, one uses dipole arrays,
where all dipole elements are connected to each
other.
The most common antenna type, however, is
a parabolic reﬂector, which works exactly as an
optical mirror telescope. At long wavelengths the
reﬂecting surface does not need to be solid, be-
cause the long wavelength photons cannot see the
holes in the reﬂector, and the antenna is there-
fore usually made in the form of a metal mesh.
At high frequencies the surface has to be smooth,
and in the millimetre-submillimetre range, radio
astronomers even use large optical telescopes,
which they equip with their own radiometers.
To ensure a coherent ampliﬁcation of the signal,
the surface irregularities should be less than one-
tenth of the wavelength used.
The main difference between a radio telescope
and an optical telescope is in the recording of
the signal. Radio telescopes are not imaging tele-
scopes (except for synthesis telescopes, which
will be described later); instead, a feed horn,
which is located at the antenna focus, transfers
the signal to a receiver. The wavelength and phase
information is, however, preserved.
The resolving power of a radio telescope, θ,
can be deduced from the same formula (3.4) as
for optical telescopes, i.e. λ/D, where λ is the
wavelength used and D is the diameter of the
aperture. Since the wavelength ratio between ra-
dio and visible light is of the order of 10,000, ra-
dio antennas with diameters of several kilometres
are needed in order to achieve the same resolution
as for optical telescopes. In the early days of radio
astronomy poor resolution was the biggest draw-
back for the development and recognition of radio
astronomy. For example, the antenna used by Jan-
sky had a fan beam with a resolution of about 30◦
in the narrower direction. Therefore radio obser-
vations could not be compared with optical ob-
servations. Neither was it possible to identify the
radio sources with optical counterparts.
The world’s biggest radio telescope is the
Arecibo antenna in Puerto Rico, whose main re-
ﬂector has a diameter of 305 m. It is a ﬁxed metal
mesh built over a natural round valley (Fig. 3.29).
In the late 1970’s the antenna surface and re-
ceivers were upgraded, enabling the antenna to be
used down to wavelengths of 5 cm. The mirror of
the Arecibo telescope is not parabolic but spher-
ical, and the antenna is equipped with a movable
feed system, which makes observations possible
within a 20◦radius around the zenith.
A similar and only partly steerable radio tele-
scope is being built in China. It will be the largest
in the world with an antenna diameter of 500 m.
The biggest completely steerable radio tele-
scope is the Green Bank telescope in Virginia,
U.S.A., dedicated at the end of 2000. It is slightly
asymmetric with a diameter of 100 × 110 m
(Fig. 3.30). Before the Green Bank telescope, for
over two decades the largest telescope was the
Effelsberg telescope in Germany. This antenna
has a parabolic main reﬂector with a diameter of
100 m. The inner 80 m of the dish is made of
solid aluminium panels, while the outmost por-
tion of the disk is a metal mesh structure. By us-
ing only the inner portion of the telescope, it has
been possible to observe down to wavelengths of
4 mm. The oldest and perhaps best-known big ra-
dio telescope is the 76 m antenna at Jodrell Bank
in Britain, which was completed in the end of the
1950’s.
The biggest telescopes are usually incapable
of operating below wavelengths of 1 cm, because
the surface cannot be made accurate enough.
However, the millimetre range has become more
and more important. In this wavelength range
there are many transitions of interstellar mole-
cules, and one can achieve quite high angular
resolution even with a single dish telescope. At

limetre telescope is about 15 m. The develop-
ment of this ﬁeld is rapid, and at present several
big millimetre telescopes are in operation (Ta-
ble C.24). Among them are the 40 m Nobeyama
telescope in Japan, which can be used down to

the 21st century is ALMA (Atacama Large Mil-
limetre Array), which consists of 64 telescopes
with a diameter of 12 m (Fig. 3.31). It was built
as an international project by the United States,
Europe and Japan in Chile on the Chajnantor
plateau.
As already mentioned, the resolving power of
a radio telescope is far poorer than that of an op-
tical telescope. The biggest radio telescopes can
at present reach a resolution of 5 arc seconds,
and that only at the very highest frequencies. To
improve the resolution by increasing the size is
difﬁcult, because the present telescopes are al-
ready close to the practical upper limit. However,
by combining radio telescopes and interferome-
ters, it is possible to achieve even better resolu-
tion than with optical telescopes.
As early as 1891 Michelson used an interfer-
ometer for astronomical purposes. While the use
of interferometers has proved to be quite difﬁcult
in the optical wavelength regime, interferometers
Fig. 3.32 The principle of an interferometer. If the ra-
diation reaches the radio telescopes in the same phase,
the waves amplify each other and a maximum is obtained
in the combined radiation (cases 1 and 3). If the incom-
ing waves are in opposite phase, they cancel each other
(case 2)
are extremely useful in the radio region. To form
an interferometer, one needs at least two anten-
nas coupled together. The spacing between the
antennas, D, is called the baseline. Let us ﬁrst
assume that the baseline is perpendicular to the
line of sight (Fig. 3.32). Then the radiation ar-
rives at both antennas with the same phase, and

78

the summed signal shows a maximum. However,
due to the rotation of the Earth, the direction of
the baseline changes, producing a phase differ-
ence between the two signals. The result is a sinu-
soidal interference pattern, in which minima oc-
cur when the phase difference is 180 degrees. The
distance between the peaks is given by
θD = λ,
where θ is the angle the baseline has turned and
λ is the wavelength of the received signal. The
resolution of the interferometer is thus equal to
that of an antenna with a linear size equal to D.
If the source is not a point source, the radi-
ation emitted from different parts of the source
will have phase differences when it enters the an-
tennas. In this case the minima of the interference
pattern will not be zero, but will have some posi-
tive value Pmin. If we denote the maximum value
of the interference pattern by Pmax, the ratio
Pmax −Pmin
Pmax + Pmin
gives a measure of the source size (fringe visibil-
ity).
More detailed information about the source
structure can be obtained by changing the base-
line by changing the relative positions of the
antennas. In principle it is possible to observe
the same amount of details as with a single an-
tenna with the same size as the area covered
by the movable antennas in their different posi-
tions. This way interferometry is transformed into
a technique called aperture synthesis.
The theory and techniques of aperture synthe-
sis were developed particularly by the British as-
tronomer Sir Martin Ryle. In Fig. 3.33 the prin-
ciple of aperture synthesis is illustrated. If the
telescopes are located on an east–west track, the
spacing between them, projected onto the sky,
will in 12 hours describe a circle or an ellipse, de-
pending on the position of the source as the Earth
rotates around its axis. If one varies the distance
between the telescopes, one will get a series of
circles or ellipses on the sky. As we can see from
Fig. 3.29, one does not have to cover all the spac-
ings between the telescopes, because any antenna
Fig. 3.33 To illustrate the principle of aperture synthe-
sis, let us consider an east–west oriented interferometer
pointed towards the celestial north. Each antenna is iden-
tical, has a diameter D and operates at a wavelength λ.
The minimum spacing between each antenna element is a,
and the maximum spacing is 6a. In (a) there are only
two antennas, A and B, displaced by the maximum spac-
ing 6a. When the earth rotates, antennas A and B will,
in the course of 12 hours, track a circle on the plane of
the sky with a diameter λ/(6a), the maximum resolution
that can be achieved with this interferometer. In (b) the
antenna C is added to the interferometer, thus providing
two more baselines, which track the circles AC and BC
with radii of λ/(2a) and λ/(4a), respectively. In (c) there
is still another antenna D added to the interferometer. In
this case two of the baselines are equal, AD and CD, and
therefore only two new circles are covered on the plane
of the sky. By adding more interferometer elements, one
can ﬁll in the missing parts within the primary beam, i.e.
the beam of one single dish, and thus obtain a full cov-
erage of the beam. The resolution of the system depends
on the maximum separation of the antennas. It is evident
from (c), that not all of the antenna positions are needed to
provide all the different spacings; some antenna spacings
will in such a case be equal and therefore provide no addi-
tional information. It is essential to position the antennas
in such a way that as many different baselines as possi-
ble are formed. The observed values and the image of the
target are related by a Fourier transform
combination which has the same relative distance
will describe the same path on the sky. In this way
one can synthesise an antenna, a ﬁlled aperture,
with a size equal to the maximum spacing be-
tween the telescopes. Interferometers working ac-
cording to this principle are called aperture syn-

3.4

Fig. 3.34 The VLA at Socorro, New Mexico, is a synthesis telescope consisting of 27 movable antennas
thesis telescopes. If one covers all the spacings up
to the maximum baseline, the result will be an ac-
curate map of the source over the primary beam
of an individual antenna element. Aperture syn-
thesis telescopes therefore produce an image of
the sky, i.e. a “radio photograph”.
A typical aperture synthesis telescope consists
of one ﬁxed telescope and a number of mov-
able telescopes, usually located on an east–west
track, although T or Y conﬁgurations are also
quite common. The number of telescopes used
determines how fast one can synthesise a larger
disk, because the number of possible antenna
combinations increases as n(n −1), where n is
the number of telescopes. It is also possible to
synthesise a large telescope with only one ﬁxed
and one movable telescope by changing the spac-
ing between the telescopes every 12 hours, but
then a full aperture synthesis can require several
months of observing time. In order for this tech-
nique to work, the source must be constant, i.e.
the signal cannot be time variable during the ob-
serving session.
The most efﬁcient aperture synthesis tele-
scopes at present are the VLA (Very Large Array)
in New Mexico, USA (Fig. 3.34) and ALMA in
Chile.
VLA consists of 27 paraboloid antennas, each
with a diameter of 25 m, which are located on
a Y-shaped track. The Y-formation was chosen
because it provides a full aperture synthesis in
8 hours. Each antenna can be moved by a spe-
cially built carrier, and the locations of the tele-
scopes are chosen to give optimal spacings for
each conﬁguration. In the largest conﬁguration
each arm is about 21 km long, thereby resulting
in an antenna with an effective diameter of 35 km.
If the VLA is used in its largest conﬁguration
and at its highest frequency, 23 GHz (1.3 cm),
the resolution achieved is 0.1 arc second, clearly
superior to any optical telescope. Similar resolu-
tion can also be obtained with the British MER-
LIN telescope, where already existing telescopes
have been coupled together by radio links. Other
well-known synthesis telescopes are the Cam-
bridge 5 km array in Britain and the Westerbork
array in the Netherlands, both located on east–
west tracks.
Even higher resolution can be obtained with
an extension of the aperture synthesis technique,

80

called VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferome-
try). With the VLBI technique the spacing be-
tween the antennas is restricted only by the size
of the Earth. Some of the antennas can even be
on satellites, in which case the baseline can be
arbitrarily long. The antennas are all pointed to-
wards the same source. The signal is recorded to-
gether with accurate timing signals from atomic
clocks. The data ﬁles are correlated against each
other, resulting in maps similar to those obtained
with a normal aperture synthesis telescope. With
VLBI techniques it is possible to achieve resolu-
tions of 0.00001′′ if one of the telescopes is or-
biting the Earth. Because interferometry is very
sensitive to the distance between the telescopes,
the VLBI technique also provides one of the most
accurate methods to measure distances. Currently
one can measure distances with an accuracy of
a few millimetres on intercontinental baselines.
This is utilised in geodetic VLBI experiments,
which study continental drift and polar motion as
a function of time.
In radio astronomy the maximum size of sin-
gle antennas has also been reached. The trend
is to build synthesis antennas. In the 1990’s The
United States built a chain of antennas extending
across the whole continent, and the Australians
have constructed a similar, but north–south an-
tenna chain across their country.
More and more observations are being made
in the submillimetre region. The disturbing effect
of atmospheric water vapour becomes more se-
rious at shorter wavelengths; thus, submillimetre
telescopes must be located on mountain tops, like
optical telescopes. All parts of the mirror are ac-
tively controlled in order to accurately maintain
the proper form like in the new optical telescopes.
Several new submillimetre telescopes are under
construction.

Other Wavelength Regions
The Earth receives electromagnetic radiation
from the sky at all wavelengths However, as
mentioned in Sect. 3.1, not all radiation reaches
the ground. The wavelength regions absorbed by
the atmosphere have only been studied more ex-
tensively since the 1970’s, using Earth-orbiting
satellites (Fig. 3.37). Besides the optical and ra-
dio regions, there are only some narrow wave-
length ranges in the infrared that can be observed
from high mountain tops.
The ﬁrst observations in each new wavelength
region were usually carried out from balloons, but
not until rockets came into use could observa-
tions be made from outside the atmosphere. The
ﬁrst actual observations of an X-ray source, for
instance, were made on a rocket ﬂight in June
1962, when the detector rose above the atmo-
sphere for about 6 minutes. Finally, Earth orbiting
satellites have made it possible to map the whole
sky in the wavelength regions invisible from the
ground.
Gamma Radiation
Gamma ray astronomy
studies
radiation
quanta
with
energies
of
105–1014 eV. The boundary between gamma and
X-ray astronomy, 105 eV, corresponds to a wave-
length of 10−11 m. The boundary is not ﬁxed; the
regions of hard (= high-energy) X-rays and soft
gamma rays partly overlap.
While ultraviolet, visible and infrared radia-
tion are all produced by changes in the energy
states of the electron envelopes of atoms, gamma
and hard X-rays are produced by transitions in
atomic nuclei or in mutual interactions of ele-
mentary particles. Thus observations of the short-
est wavelengths give information on processes
different from those giving rise to longer wave-
lengths.
The ﬁrst observations of gamma sources were
obtained at the end of the 1960’s, when a device
in the OSO 3 satellite (Orbiting Solar Observa-
tory) detected gamma rays from the Milky Way.
Later on, many satellites have been especially
designed for gamma astronomy. The most re-
cent satellites include the Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory, operating in 1991–2000, the Euro-
pean Integral, launched in 2002, and the Ameri-
can Fermi, originally called GLAST.
The quanta of gamma radiation have energies
a million times greater than those of visible light,
and therefore they cannot be observed with sim-
ilar detectors. Observations are made with vari-
ous scintillation detectors, usually composed of
several layers of detector plates, where gamma

nary islands observes the Cherenkov radiation produced

tut für Physik)
radiation is transformed by the photoelectric ef-
fect into visible light, detectable by photomulti-
pliers.
The energy of a gamma quantum can be deter-
mined from the depth to which it penetrates the
detector. Analysing the trails left by the quanta
gives information on their approximate direction.
The ﬁeld of view is limited by the grating. The
directional accuracy is low, and in gamma astron-
omy the resolution is still far below that of other
wavelength regions.
Gamma radiation cannot pass through the at-
mosphere, yet it has effects that can be observed
with ground based instruments. When a high-
energy photon enters the atmosphere it can cre-
ate particle-antiparticle pairs. These particles can
get such a high energy that they move faster than
the local speed of light in the atmosphere. Such
particles radiate ˇCherenkov radiation that can be
detected as visible light (Fig. 3.35).
X-rays
The observational domain of X-ray as-
tronomy includes the energies between 102 and
105 eV, or the wavelengths 10–0.01 nm. The re-
gions 10–0.1 nm and 0.1–0.01 nm are called soft
and hard X-rays, respectively. X-rays were dis-
covered in the late 19th century. Systematic stud-
ies of the sky at X-ray wavelengths only became
possible in the 1970’s with the advent of satellite
technology.
The ﬁrst all-sky mapping was made in the
early 1970’s by SAS 1 (Small Astronomical
Satellite), also called Uhuru. At the end of the
1970’s, two High-Energy Astronomy Observa-
tories, HEAO 1 and 2 (the latter called Einstein),
mapped the sky with much higher sensitivity than
Uhuru.
The Einstein Observatory was able to detect
sources about a thousand times fainter than ear-
lier X-ray telescopes. In optical astronomy, this
would correspond to a jump from a 15 cm reﬂec-
tor to a 5 m telescope. Thus X-ray astronomy has
developed in 20 years as much as optical astron-
omy in 300 years.
The latest X-ray satellites have been the Amer-
ican Chandra and the European XMM-Newton,
both launched in 1999.
Besides satellites mapping the whole sky,
there have been several satellites observing the X-
ray radiation of the Sun. The most recent ones are
the Japanese Yohkoh and Hinode and the Ameri-
can RHESSI.
The ﬁrst X-ray telescopes used detectors sim-
ilar to those in gamma astronomy. Their di-
rectional accuracy was never better than a few
arc minutes. The more precise X-ray telescopes
utilise
the
principle
of
grazing
reﬂection
(Fig. 3.36). An X-ray hitting a surface perpendic-
ularly is not reﬂected, but absorbed. If, however,
X-rays meet the mirror nearly parallel to its sur-
face, just grazing it, a high quality surface can
reﬂect the ray.
The mirror of an X-ray reﬂector is on the in-
ner surface of a slowly narrowing cone. The outer
part of the surface is a paraboloid and the inner
part a hyperboloid. The rays are reﬂected by both
surfaces and meet at a focal plane. In practice,
several tubes are installed one within another. For
instance, the four cones of the Einstein Obser-
vatory had as much polished optical surface as
a normal telescope with a diameter of 2.5 m. The
resolution in X-ray telescopes is of the order of
a few arc seconds and the ﬁeld of view about
1 deg.

Observations and Instruments
Fig. 3.36 X-rays are not reﬂected by an ordinary mirror,
and the principle of grazing reﬂection must be used for
collecting them. Radiation meets the paraboloid mirror at
a very small angle, is reﬂected onto a hyperboloid mirror
and further to a focal point. In practice, several mirrors are
placed one inside another, collecting radiation in a com-
mon focus
The detectors in X-ray astronomy are usually
Geiger–Müller counters, proportional counters
or scintillation detectors. Geiger–Müller and pro-
portional counters are boxes ﬁlled with gas. The
walls form a cathode, and an anode wire runs
through the middle of the box; in more accu-
rate counters, there are several anode wires. An
X-ray quantum entering the box ionises the gas,
and the potential difference between the anode
and cathode gives rise to a current of electrons
and positive ions. In recent imaging instruments
(like the ACIS in Chandra) also CCD cameras are
used.
Ultraviolet Radiation
Between X-rays and the
optical region lies the domain of ultraviolet radi-
ation, with wavelengths between 10 and 400 nm.
Most ultraviolet observations have been carried
out in the soft UV region, at wavelengths near
those of optical light, since most of the UV radi-
ation is absorbed by the atmosphere. The wave-
lengths below 300 nm are completely blocked
out. The short wavelength region from 10 to
91.2 nm is called the extreme ultraviolet (EUV,
XUV).
Extreme ultraviolet was one of the last regions
of the electromagnetic radiation to be observed
systematically. The reason for this is that the ab-
sorption of interstellar hydrogen makes the sky
practically opaque at these wavelengths. The vis-
ibility in most directions is limited to some hun-
dred light years in the vicinity of the Sun. In some
directions, however, the density of the interstellar
gas is so low that even extragalactic objects can
be seen.
The ﬁrst dedicated EUV satellite was the Ex-
treme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), operating in
1992–2000. It observed about a thousand EUV
sources. In EUV grazing reﬂection telescopes
similar to those used in X-ray astronomy are em-
ployed.
In nearly all branches of astronomy important
information is obtained by observations of ultra-
violet radiation. Many emission lines from stel-
lar chromospheres or coronas, the Lyman lines of
atomic hydrogen, and most of the radiation from
hot stars are found in the UV domain. In the near-
ultraviolet, telescopes can be made similar to op-
tical telescopes and, equipped with a photome-
ter or spectrometer, installed in a satellite orbiting
the Earth.
The most effective satellites in the UV have
been the European TD-1, the American Orbit-
ing Astronomical Observatories OAO 2 and 3
(Copernicus), and the International Ultraviolet
Explorer IUE. The instruments of the TD-1 satel-
lite included both a photometer and a spectrome-
ter. The satellite measured the magnitudes of over
30,000 stars in four different spectral regions be-
tween 135 and 274 nm, and registered UV spec-
tra from over 1000 stars. The OAO satellites were
also used to measure magnitudes and spectra, and
OAO 3 worked for over eight years.
The IUE satellite, launched in 1978, was one
of the most successful astronomical satellites.
IUE had a 45 cm Ritchey-Chrétien telescope with
an aperture ratio of f/15 and a ﬁeld of view of

16 arc minutes. The satellite had two spectro-
graphs to measure spectra of higher or lower res-
olution in wavelength intervals of 115–200 nm
or 190–320 nm. For registration of the spec-
tra, a Vidicon camera was used. IUE was differ-
ent from earlier satellites, since it could be used

almost like ground based telescopes. The ob-
server could follow the observations and change
them in real time. IUE worked on the orbit for
20 years.
The Hubble space telescope can also make
observations in the ultraviolet. Some ultraviolet
telescopes have also been on shuttle ﬂight in the
1990’s.
Infrared
Radiation
Radiation
with
longer
wavelengths than visible light is called infrared
radiation. This region extends from about 1 mi-
crometre to 1 millimetre, where the radio region
begins. Sometimes the near-infrared, at wave-
lengths below 5 µm, and the submillimetre do-
main, at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1 mm, are
considered separate wavelength regions.
In infrared observations radiation is collected
by a telescope, as in the optical region. The in-
coming radiation consists of radiation from the
object, from the background and from the tele-
scope itself. Both the source and the background
must be continually measured, the difference giv-
Fig. 3.38 Refractors are not suitable for infrared tele-
scopes, because infrared radiation cannot penetrate glass.
The Cassegrain reﬂectors intended especially for infrared
observations have secondary mirrors nodding rapidly back
and forth between the object and the background near the
object. By subtracting the brightness of the background
from the brightness of the object, the background can be
eliminated
ing the radiation from the object. The background
measurements can be made with a Cassegrain
secondary mirror oscillating between the source
and the background at a rate of, say, 100 oscil-
lations per second, and thus the changing back-
ground can be eliminated (Fig. 3.38). To register
the measurements, semiconductor detectors are
used. The detector must always be cooled to min-
imise its own thermal radiation. Sometimes the
whole telescope is cooled.
Infrared observatories have been built on high
mountain tops, where most of the atmospheric
water vapour remains below. Some favourable
sites are, e.g. Mauna Kea on Hawaii, Mount
Lemon in Arizona and Pico del Teide on Tenerife.
For observations in the far-infrared these moun-
tains are not high enough; these observations are
carried out, e.g. on aeroplanes. One of the best-
equipped planes is the Kuiper Airborne Observa-
tory KAO, named after the well-known planetary
scientist Gerard Kuiper.
Balloons and satellites are also used for in-
frared observations. The ﬁrst powerful infrared
observatory was the InfraRed Astronomy Satel-
lite IRAS, built by the United States and Holland
and launched in 1983. It made observations for
eight months and mapped the sky at four wave-
lengths (12, 25, 60 and 100 µm), and found over
200,000 new infrared sources.
The European Infrared Space Observatory
ISO, made more detailed observations of thou-
sands of infrared objects in 1996–1998. Since
2003 Spitzer (originally SIRTF, Space InfraRed
Telescope Facility). has been mapping the in-
frared sky. In 2009 ESA launched its own Her-
schel satellite (Fig. 3.39), which operated till
2013, when the liquid helium used for cooling
was exhausted.
Infrared satellites have also been used to map
the afterglow of the big bang of the universe.
A very successful satellite was the 1989 launched
COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), which
mapped the background radiation in submillime-
tre and infrared wavelengths. The Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP) has continued the work
of COBE, starting in 2001. In 2009 the even
more powerful European Planck satellite was
launched.

Other Forms of Energy
Besides electromagnetic radiation, energy arrives
from space in other forms: particles (cosmic rays,
neutrinos) and gravitational radiation.
Cosmic Rays
Cosmic rays, consisting of elec-
trons and totally ionised nuclei of atoms, are re-
ceived in equal amounts from all directions. Their
incoming directions do not reveal their origin,
since cosmic rays are electrically charged; thus
their paths are continually changed when they
move through the magnetic ﬁelds of the Milky
Way. The high energies of cosmic rays mean that
they have to be produced by high-energy phe-
nomena like supernova explosions. The major-
ity of cosmic rays are protons (nearly 90 %)
and helium nuclei (10 %), but some are heav-
ier nuclei; their energies lie between 108 and
1020 eV.

86

Observations and Instruments
Fig. 3.39 (Continued)
The most energetic cosmic rays give rise to
secondary radiation, mainly muons, when they
hit molecules of the atmosphere. This secondary
radiation can be observed from the ground. Just
like particles produces by gamma rays particles
of the secondary radiation can move faster than
light in the atmosphere emitting ˇCerenkov radi-
ation. Thus the cosmic rays can also be detected
by their ˇCerenkov radiation.
The Pierre Auger telescope in Argentina ob-
serves both secondary particles and ˇCerenkov ra-
diation to detect cosmic rays with energies at least
of the order of 1018 eV. Since only about one
such particle hits an area of one square kilometre
in a century, the detectors have been positioned in
an area of 3000 square kilometres.
Primary cosmic rays can only be directly ob-
served outside the atmosphere. The detectors
used to observe cosmic rays are similar to those
used in particle physics. Since Earth-based accel-
erators reach energies of only about 1012 eV, cos-
mic rays offer an excellent “natural” laboratory
for particle physics. Many satellites and space-
craft have detectors for cosmic rays.
Neutrinos
Neutrinos are elementary particles
with no electric charge. Earlier it was thought that
they are massless, but currently they seem to have
a tiny rest mass. They interact with other mat-
ter only through the weak nuclear force, which
is very much weaker than the electromagnetic or
strong nuclear force.
Most neutrinos are produced in nuclear reac-
tions within stars and in supernova explosions.
Since they react very weakly with other matter,
they escape directly from the stellar interior.
Due to their weak interaction neutrinos are
very difﬁcult to observe; trillions of them pass
through this page every second without any no-
ticeable consequences.
The ﬁrst method of detection was the radio-
chemical method. As a reactive agent, e.g. tetra-
chloroethene (C2Cl4) can be used. When a neu-
trino hits a chlorine atom, the chlorine is trans-
formed into argon, and an electron is freed:
37Cl + ν →37Ar + e−.
The argon atom is radioactive and can be ob-
served. Instead of chlorine, lithium and gallium
might be used to detect neutrinos. The ﬁrst gal-
lium detectors have been running in Italy and
Russia from the end of the 1980’s.
Another observation method is based on the
ˇCerenkov radiation produced by neutrinos in ex-

3.6

Fig. 3.40 The Sudbury neutrino observatory (SNO) is at
the depth of two kilometres in a still operational mine. The
spherical vessel contains liquid where neutrinos produce
Cherenkov radiation. 9600 photomultipliers are used to
register the ﬂashes of the radiation. Earlier the liquid was
heavy water but that was later replaced with alkyl benzene.
The observations have already solved the solar neutrino
problem (Sect. 13.1). The new SNO+ will be able to ob-
serve neutrinos of even lower energies. (Photos SNOlab,

tremely pure water. The ﬂashes of light are regis-
tered with photomultipliers, and thus it is possi-
ble to ﬁnd out the direction of the radiation. This
method is used e.g. in the Japanese Kamiokande
detector and in the Sudbury neutrino observatory
in Canada (Fig. 3.40).
The largest neutrino detector is the IceCube in
the Antarctic, ﬁnished in 2010. It consists of one
cubic kilometre of ice.
Neutrino detectors must be located deep under
the ground to protect them from the secondary
radiation caused by cosmic rays. Also radioactive
decay inside the Earth cases background noise.
The detectors have observed neutrinos from
the Sun, and the Supernova 1987A in the Large
Magellanic Cloud was also observed in 1987. In
the future, also the dark matter and other neutrino
producing phenomena will be studied.
Gravitational Radiation
Gravitational astron-
omy is as young as neutrino astronomy. The
ﬁrst attempts to measure gravitational waves were
made in the 1960’s. Gravitational radiation is
emitted by accelerating masses, just as electro-
magnetic radiation is emitted by electric charges
in accelerated motion. Detection of gravitational
waves is very difﬁcult, and they have been ob-
served only very recently.
The ﬁrst type of gravitational wave antenna
was the Weber cylinder. It is an aluminium cylin-
der which starts vibrating at its proper frequency
when hit by a gravitational pulse. The distance
between the ends of the cylinder changes by
about 10−17 m, and the changes in the length are
studied by strain sensors welded to the side of the
cylinder.
Another type of modern gravity radiation de-
tectors measures “spatial strain” induced by grav-
ity waves and consists of two sets of mirrors in
directions perpendicular to each other (Michel-
son interferometer), or one set of parallel mir-
rors (Fabry–Perot interferometer). The relative
distances between the mirrors are monitored by
laser interferometers. If a gravity pulse passes the
detector, the distances change and the changes
can be measured. The longest baseline between
the mirrors is in the American LIGO (Laser Inter-

ferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) sys-
tem (Fig. 3.41). LIGO made the ﬁrst scientiﬁc
observations in 2002. In early 2016 the ﬁrst pos-
itive detection of gravitational waves was an-
nounced. The observation was made in Septem-
ber 14, 2015.
Although the gravitational detectors are iso-
lated from their surroundings as carefully as pos-
sible, many perturbations can make them oscil-
late. A positive detection requires that the same
phenomenon is observed by different instruments
located far away from each others.
Box 3.1 (Diffraction by a Circular Aperture)
Consider a circular hole of radius R in the
xy plane. Coherent light enters the hole from
the direction of the negative z axis (see ﬁg-
ure). We consider light rays leaving the hole
parallel to the xz plane forming an angle θ
with the z axis. The light waves interfere on
a screen far away. The phase difference be-
tween a wave through a point (x,y) and a wave
going through the centre of the hole can be
calculated from the different path lengths s =
x sinθ:
δ = s
λ2π = 2π sinθ
λ
x ≡kx.
Thus, the phase difference δ depends on the
x coordinate only. The sum of the amplitudes
of the waves from a small surface element is
proportional to the area of the element dx dy.
Let the amplitude coming through the centre of
the hole be da0 = dx dyˆi. The amplitude com-
ing from the point (x,y) is then
da = dx dy

In mirror telescopes diffraction is caused
also by the support structure of the secondary

tions may become rather cumbersome. How-
ever, it can be shown that the diffraction pattern
can be obtained as the Fourier transform of the
aperture.

nents of the binary star ζ Herculis is 1.38′′. What
should the diameter of a telescope be to resolve

piece be to resolve the components, when the res-
olution of the eye is 2′?

Photometric Concepts and Magnitudes
Most astronomical observations utilise electro-
magnetic radiation in one way or another. We can
obtain information on the physical nature of a ra-
diation source by studying the energy distribution
of its radiation. We shall now introduce some ba-
sic concepts that characterise electromagnetic ra-
diation.
4.1
Intensity, Flux Density and
Luminosity
Let us assume we have some radiation passing
through a surface element dA (Fig. 4.1). Some of
the radiation will leave dA within a solid angle
dω; the angle between dω and the normal to the
surface is denoted by θ. The amount of energy
with frequency in the range [ν,ν + dν] entering
this solid angle in time dt is
dEν = Iν cosθ dAdν dω dt.
(4.1)
Here, the coefﬁcient Iν is the speciﬁc intensity
of the radiation at the frequency ν in the di-
rection of the solid angle dω. Its dimension is
Wm−2 Hz−1 sterad−1.
The projection of the surface element dA as
seen from the direction θ is dAn = dAcosθ,
which explains the factor cosθ. If the intensity
does not depend on direction, the energy dEν is
directly proportional to the surface element per-
pendicular to the direction of the radiation.
The intensity including all possible frequen-
cies is called the total intensity I, and is obtained
Fig. 4.1 The intensity Iν of radiation is related to the en-
ergy passing through a surface element dA into a solid
angle dω, in a direction θ

More important quantities from the observa-
tional point of view are the energy ﬂux (Lν,L)
or, brieﬂy, the ﬂux and the ﬂux density (Fν,F ).
The ﬂux density gives the power of radiation per
unit area; hence its dimension is Wm−2 Hz−1
or Wm−2, depending on whether we are talking
about the ﬂux density at a certain frequency or
about the total ﬂux density.
Observed ﬂux densities are usually rather
small, and Wm−2 would be an inconveniently
large unit. Therefore, especially in radio astron-

omy, ﬂux densities are often expressed in Jan-
skys; one Jansky (Jy) equals 10−26 Wm−2 Hz−1.
When we are observing a radiation source, we
in fact measure the energy collected by the de-
tector during some period of time, which equals
the ﬂux density integrated over the radiation-
collecting area of the instrument and the time in-
terval.

I is independent of the direction, we get

The solid angle element dω is equal to a surface
element on a unit sphere. In spherical coordinates
it is (Fig. 4.2; also cf. Appendix A.5):
dω = sinθ dθ dφ.
Substitution into (4.3) gives
F = I

cosθ sinθ dθ dφ = 0,
so there is no net ﬂux of radiation. This means
that there are equal amounts of radiation entering
and leaving the surface. If we want to know the
amount of radiation passing through the surface,
we can ﬁnd, for example, the radiation leaving the
surface. For isotropic radiation this is

In the astronomical literature, terms such as
intensity and brightness are used rather vaguely.
Fig. 4.2 An inﬁnitesimal solid angle dω is equal to
the corresponding surface element on a unit sphere:
dω = sinθ dθ dφ
Flux density is hardly ever called ﬂux density
but intensity or (with luck) ﬂux. Therefore the
reader should always carefully check the mean-
ing of these terms.
Flux means the power going through some
surface, expressed in watts. The ﬂux emitted by
a star into a solid angle ω is L = ωr2F , where
F is the ﬂux density observed at a distance r. To-
tal ﬂux is the ﬂux passing through a closed sur-
face encompassing the source. Astronomers usu-
ally call the total ﬂux of a star the luminosity L.
We can also talk about the luminosity Lν at a fre-
quency ν ([Lν] = WHz−1). (This must not be
confused with the luminous ﬂux used in physics;
the latter takes into account the sensitivity of the
eye.)
If the source (like a typical star) radiates
isotropically, its radiation at a distance r is dis-
tributed evenly on a spherical surface whose area
is 4πr2 (Fig. 4.3). If the ﬂux density of the radi-
ation passing through this surface is F , the total
ﬂux is
L = 4πr2F.
(4.5)
If we are outside the source, where radiation is
not created or destroyed, the luminosity does not
depend on distance. The ﬂux density, on the other
hand, falls off proportional to 1/r2.

4.2
Apparent Magnitudes
93
For extended objects (as opposed to objects
such as stars visible only as points) we can de-
ﬁne the surface brightness as the ﬂux density per
unit solid angle (Fig. 4.4). Now the observer is at
the apex of the solid angle. The surface bright-
ness is independent of distance, which can be un-
derstood in the following way. The ﬂux density
arriving from an area A is inversely proportional
to the distance squared. But also the solid an-
gle subtended by the area A is proportional to
1/r2 (ω = A/r2). Thus the surface brightness
B = F/ω remains constant.
Fig. 4.3 An energy ﬂux which at a distance r from a point
source is distributed over an area A is spread over an
area 4A at a distance 2r. Thus the ﬂux density decreases
inversely proportional to the distance squared
The energy density u of radiation is the amount
of energy per unit volume (Jm−3):
u = 1

I dω.
(4.6)
This can be seen as follows. Suppose we have ra-
diation with intensity I arriving from a solid an-
gle dω perpendicular to the surface dA (Fig. 4.5).
In the time dt, the radiation travels a distance c dt
and ﬁlls a volume dV = c dt dA. Thus the energy
in the volume dV is (now cosθ = 1)
dE = I dAdω dt = 1
c I dω dV.
Hence the energy density du of the radiation ar-
riving from the solid angle dω is
du = dE
dV = 1
c I dω,
and the total energy density is obtained by inte-
grating this over all directions. For isotropic radi-
ation we get
u = 4π
c I.

Apparent Magnitudes
As early as the second century B.C., Hipparchos
divided the visible stars into six classes according
to their apparent brightness. The ﬁrst class con-
tained the brightest stars and the sixth the faintest
ones still visible to the naked eye.
Fig. 4.4 An observer sees
radiation coming from
a constant solid angle ω.
The area giving off
radiation into this solid
angle increases when the
source moves further away
(A ∝r2). Therefore the
surface brightness or the
observed ﬂux density per
unit solid angle remains
constant

Photometric Concepts and Magnitudes
Fig. 4.5 In time dt, the radiation ﬁlls a volume
dV = c dt dA, where dA is the surface element perpen-
dicular to the propagation direction of the radiation
The response of the human eye to the bright-
ness of light is not linear. If the ﬂux densities
of three stars are in the proportion 1:10:100, the
brightness difference of the ﬁrst and second star
seems to be equal to the difference of the second
and third star. Equal brightness ratios correspond
to equal apparent brightness differences: the hu-
man perception of brightness is logarithmic.
The rather vague classiﬁcation of Hipparchos
was replaced in 1856 by Norman R. Pogson. The
new, more accurate classiﬁcation followed the old
one as closely as possible, resulting in another of
those illogical deﬁnitions typical of astronomy.
Since a star of the ﬁrst class is about one hun-
dred times brighter than a star of the sixth class,
Pogson deﬁned the ratio of the brightnesses of
classes n and n + 1 as
5√
100 = 2.512.
The brightness class or magnitude can be de-
ﬁned accurately in terms of the observed ﬂux den-
sity F ([F] = Wm−2). We decide that the magni-
tude 0 corresponds to some preselected ﬂux den-
sity F0. All other magnitudes are then deﬁned by
the equation
m = −2.5lg F
F0
.
(4.8)
Note that the coefﬁcient is exactly 2.5, not 2.512!
Magnitudes are dimensionless quantities, but to
remind us that a certain value is a magnitude, we
can write it, for example, as 5 mag or 5m.
It is easy to see that (4.8) is equivalent to Pog-
son’s deﬁnition. If the magnitudes of two stars
are m and m + 1 and their ﬂux densities Fm
and Fm+1, respectively, we have
m −(m + 1) = −2.5lg Fm
F0
+ 2.5lg Fm+1
F0
= −2.5lg Fm
Fm+1
,
whence
Fm
Fm+1
=
5√
100.
In the same way we can show that the magnitudes
m1 and m2 of two stars and the corresponding
ﬂux densities F1 and F2 are related by
m1 −m2 = −2.5lg F1
F2
.
(4.9)
Magnitudes extend both ways from the orig-
inal six values. The magnitude of the brightest
star, Sirius, is in fact negative −1.5. The magni-
tude of the Sun is −26.8 and that of a full moon
−12.5. The magnitude of the faintest objects ob-
served depends on the size of the telescope, the
sensitivity of the detector and the exposure time.
The limit keeps being pushed towards fainter ob-
jects; currently the magnitudes of the faintest ob-
served objects are over 30.
4.3
Magnitude Systems
The apparent magnitude m, which we have just
deﬁned, depends on the instrument we use to
measure it. The sensitivity of the detector is dif-
ferent at different wavelengths. Also, different
instruments detect different wavelength ranges.
Thus the ﬂux measured by the instrument equals
not the total ﬂux, but only a fraction of it. De-
pending on the method of observation, we can de-
ﬁne various magnitude systems. Different mag-
nitudes have different zero points, i.e. they have
different ﬂux densities F0 corresponding to the
magnitude 0. The zero points are usually deﬁned
by a few selected standard stars.
In daylight the human eye is most sensitive to
radiation with a wavelength of about 550 nm, the
sensitivity decreasing towards red (longer wave-
lengths) and violet (shorter wavelengths). The
magnitude corresponding to the sensitivity of the
eye is called the visual magnitude mv.
Photographic plates are usually most sensitive
at blue and violet wavelengths, but they are also
able to register radiation not visible to the hu-
man eye. Thus the photographic magnitude mpg
usually differs from the visual magnitude. The
sensitivity of the eye can be simulated by using

4.3
Magnitude Systems
95
a yellow ﬁlter and plates sensitised to yellow and
green light. Magnitudes thus observed are called
photovisual magnitudes mpv.
If, in ideal case, we were able to measure the
radiation at all wavelengths, we would get the
bolometric magnitude mbol. In practice this is
very difﬁcult, since part of the radiation is ab-
sorbed by the atmosphere; also, different wave-
lengths require different detectors. (In fact there
is a gadget called the bolometer, which, however,
is not a real bolometer but an infrared detector.)
The bolometric magnitude can be derived from
the visual magnitude if we know the bolometric
correction BC:
mbol = mv −BC.
(4.10)
By deﬁnition, the bolometric correction is zero
for radiation of solar type stars (or, more pre-
cisely, stars of the spectral class F5). Although the
visual and bolometric magnitudes can be equal,
the ﬂux density corresponding to the bolometric
magnitude must always be higher. The reason of
this apparent contradiction is in the different val-
ues of F0.
The more the radiation distribution differs
from that of the Sun, the higher the bolometric
correction is. The correction is positive for stars
both cooler or hotter than the Sun. Sometimes
the correction is deﬁned as mbol = mv + BC in
which case BC ≤0 always. The chance for er-
rors is, however, very small, since we must have
mbol ≤mv.
The most accurate magnitude measurements
are made using photoelectric photometers or
CCD cameras. Usually ﬁlters are used to allow
only a certain wavelength band to enter the de-
tector. One of the multicolour magnitude sys-
tems used widely in photoelectric photometry is
the UBV system developed in the early 1950’s
by Harold L. Johnson and William W. Morgan.
Magnitudes are measured through three ﬁlters,
U = ultraviolet, B = blue and V = visual. Fig-
ure 4.6 and Table 4.1 give the wavelength bands
of these ﬁlters. The magnitudes observed through
these ﬁlters are called U, B and V magnitudes,
respectively.
The UBV system was later augmented by
adding more bands. One commonly used system
Fig. 4.6 Relative transmission proﬁles of ﬁlters used in
the UBVRI magnitude system. The maxima of the bands
are normalised to unity. The R and I bands are based on
the system of Johnson, Cousins and Glass, which includes
also infrared bands J, H, K, L and M. Previously used R
and I bands differ considerably from these. The curves of
the ugriz magnitudes (dashed lines) give quantum efﬁcien-
cies. They include the atmospheric extinction for airmass

is the ﬁve colour UBVRI system, which includes
R = red and I = infrared ﬁlters.
There are also other broad band systems, but
they are not as well standardised as the UBV,
which has been deﬁned moderately well using
a great number of standard stars all over the sky.
The magnitude of an object is obtained by com-
paring it to the magnitudes of standard stars.
In Strömgren’s four-colour or uvby system, the
bands passed by the ﬁlters are much narrower
than in the UBV system. The uvby system is also
well standardised, but it is not quite as common
as the UBV. Other narrow band systems exist as
well. By adding more ﬁlters, more information on
the radiation distribution can be obtained.

Photometric Concepts and Magnitudes
In any multicolour system, we can deﬁne
colour indices; a colour index is the difference
of two magnitudes. By subtracting the B magni-
tude from U we get the colour index U −B, and
so on. If the UBV system is used, it is common to
give only the V magnitude and the colour indices
U −B and B −V .
The constants F0 in (4.8) for U, B and V mag-
nitudes have been selected in such a way that the
colour indices B −V and U −B are zero for
stars of spectral type A0 (for spectral types, see
Chap. 8). The surface temperature of such a star is
about 10,000 K. For example, Vega (α Lyr, spec-
tral class A0V) has V = 0.04, B −V = U −B =
0.00. The Sun has V = −26.8, B −V = 0.64 and
U −B = 0.12.
Before the UBV system was developed, a
colour index C.I., deﬁned as C.I. = mpg −mv
was used. The deﬁnition shows that C.I. corre-
sponds to the colour index B −V . In fact, C.I. =
(B −V ) −0.11.
Nowadays it is becoming more customary to
use the AB system (ABsolute), in which F0 is
the same, 3631 Jy, for all wavelength bands. For
instance the ugriz magnitudes used by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are based on this sys-
tem. There are several different transformation
equations between the UBV and ugriz systems
for different kinds of objects. For ordinary stars,
we can use the following:
V = g −0.2906(u −g) + 0.0885,
V = g −0.5784(g −r) −0.0038,
R = r −0.1837(g −r) −0.0971,
R = r −0.2936(r −i) −0.1439,
I = r −1.2444(r −i) −0.3820,
I = i −0.3780(i −z) −0.3974.
(4.11)
4.4
Absolute Magnitudes
Thus far we have discussed only apparent mag-
nitudes. They do not tell us anything about the
true brightness of stars, since the distances differ.
A quantity measuring the intrinsic brightness of
a star is the absolute magnitude. It is deﬁned as
Fig. 4.7 The apparent magnitude at a distance r depends
on the ﬂux density F(r). The absolute magnitude is de-
ﬁned as the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 parsecs
from the star depending only on the ﬂux density F(10) 10
parsecs away from the star
the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 par-
secs from the star (Fig. 4.7). Ofﬁcially this deﬁ-
nition was accepted in the general meeting of the
IAU in 1922.
We shall now derive an equation which relates
the apparent magnitude m, the absolute magni-
tude M and the distance r. Because the ﬂux em-
anating from a star into a solid angle ω has, at
a distance r, spread over an area ωr2, the ﬂux
density is inversely proportional to the distance
squared. Therefore the ratio of the ﬂux density at
a distance r, F(r), to the ﬂux density at a distance
of 10 parsecs, F(10), is
F(r)
F(10) =
10 pc
r
2
.
Thus the difference of magnitudes at r and 10 pc,
or the distance modulus m −M, is
m −M = −2.5lg F(r)
F(10) = −2.5lg
10 pc
r
2
or
m −M = 5lg
r
10 pc.
(4.12)
For historical reasons, this equation is almost al-
ways written as
m −M = 5lgr −5,

Extinction and Optical Thickness
97
Fig. 4.8 The interstellar
medium absorbs and
scatters radiation; this
usually reduces the energy
ﬂux L in the solid angle ω
(dL ≤0)
which is valid only if the distance is expressed in
parsecs. (The logarithm of a dimensional quan-
tity is, in fact, physically absurd.) Sometimes the
distance is given in kiloparsecs or megaparsecs,
which require different constant terms in (4.13).
To avoid confusion, we highly recommend the
form (4.12).
Absolute magnitudes are usually denoted by
capital letters. Note, however, that the U, B and
V magnitudes are apparent magnitudes. The cor-
responding absolute magnitudes are MU, MB and
MV.
The absolute bolometric magnitude can be ex-
pressed in terms of the luminosity. Let the total
ﬂux density at a distance r = 10 pc be F and let
F⊙be the equivalent quantity for the Sun. Since
the luminosity is L = 4πr2F , we get
Mbol −Mbol,⊙= −2.5lg F
F⊙
= −2.5lg L/4πr2
L⊙/4πr2 ,
or
Mbol −Mbol,⊙= −2.5lg L

.
(4.14)
The absolute bolometric magnitude Mbol = 0 cor-
responds to a luminosity L0 = 3.0 × 1028 W.
4.5
Extinction and Optical
Thickness
Equation (4.12) shows how the apparent magni-
tude increases (and brightness decreases!) with
increasing distance. If the space between the ra-
diation source and the observer is not completely
empty, but contains some interstellar medium,
(4.12) no longer holds, because part of the ra-
diation is absorbed by the medium (and usually
re-emitted at a different wavelength, which may
be outside the band deﬁning the magnitude), or
scattered away from the line of sight. All these
radiation losses are called the extinction.
Now we want to ﬁnd out how the extinction
depends on the distance. Assume we have a star
radiating a ﬂux L0 into a solid angle ω in some
wavelength range. Since the medium absorbs and
scatters radiation, the ﬂux L will now decrease
with increasing distance r (Fig. 4.8). In a short
distance interval [r,r + dr], the extinction dL is
proportional to the ﬂux L and the distance trav-
elled in the medium:
dL = −αLdr.
(4.15)
The factor α tells how effectively the medium can
obscure radiation. It is called the opacity. From
(4.15) we see that its dimension is [α] = m−1.
The opacity is zero for a perfect vacuum and ap-
proaches inﬁnity when the substance becomes re-
ally murky. We can now deﬁne a dimensionless
quantity, the optical thickness τ by
dτ = α dr.
(4.16)
Substituting this into (4.15) we get
dL = −Ldτ.
Next we integrate this from the source (where
L = L0 and r = 0) to the observer:
 L
L0
dL
L = −
 τ

dτ,
which gives
L = L0e−τ.
(4.17)

Photometric Concepts and Magnitudes
Here, τ is the optical thickness of the material be-
tween the source and the observer and L, the ob-
served ﬂux. Now, the ﬂux L falls off exponen-
tially with increasing optical thickness. Empty
space is perfectly transparent, i.e. its opacity is
α = 0; thus the optical thickness does not in-
crease in empty space, and the ﬂux remains con-
stant.
Let F0 be the ﬂux density on the surface of
a star and F(r), the ﬂux density at a distance r.
We can express the ﬂuxes as
L = ωr2F(r),
L0 = ωR2F0,
where R is the radius of the star. Substitution into
(4.16) gives
F(r) = F0
R2
r2 e−τ.
For the absolute magnitude we need the ﬂux den-
sity at a distance of 10 parsecs, F(10), which is
still evaluated without extinction:
F(10) = F0

server. If the opacity is constant along the line of

 r

dr = αr,
and (4.18) becomes
m −M = 5lg
r
10 pc + ar,
(4.19)
where the constant a = 2.5α lge gives the extinc-
tion in magnitudes per unit distance.
Colour Excess
Another effect caused by the in-
terstellar medium is the reddening of light: blue
light is scattered and absorbed more than red.
Therefore the colour index B −V increases. The
visual magnitude of a star is, from (4.18),
V = MV + 5lg
r
10 pc + AV,
(4.20)
where MV is the absolute visual magnitude and
AV is the extinction in the V passband. Similarly,
we get for the blue magnitudes
B = MB + 5lg
r
10 pc + AB.
The observed colour index is now
B −V = MB −MV + AB −AV,
or
B −V = (B −V )0 + EB−V,
(4.21)
where (B −V )0 = MB −MV is the intrinsic
colour of the star and EB−V = (B −V ) −(B −
V )0 is the colour excess. Studies of the interstel-
lar medium show that the ratio of the visual ex-
tinction AV to the colour excess EB−V is almost
constant for all stars:
R =
AV
EB−V
≈3.0.
This makes it possible to ﬁnd the visual extinction
if the colour excess is known:
AV ≈3.0EB−V.
(4.22)
When AV is obtained, the distance can be solved
directly from (4.19), when V and MV are known.
We shall study interstellar extinction in more
detail in Sect. 15.1 (“Interstellar Dust”).
Atmospheric Extinction
As we mentioned in
Sect. 3.1, the Earth’s atmosphere also causes ex-
tinction. The observed magnitude m depends on
the location of the observer and the zenith dis-
tance of the object, since these factors deter-
mine the distance the light has to travel in the

the star travels a distance H/cosz in the atmosphere; H is
the height of the atmosphere
atmosphere. To compare different observations,
we must ﬁrst reduce them, i.e. remove the at-
mospheric effects somehow. The magnitude m0
thus obtained can then be compared with other
observations.
If the zenith distance z is not too large, we can
approximate the atmosphere by a plane layer of
constant thickness (Fig. 4.9). If the thickness of
the atmosphere is used as a unit, the light must
travel a distance
X = 1/cosz = secz
(4.23)
in the atmosphere. The quantity X is the air mass.
According to (4.18), the magnitude increases lin-
early with the distance X:
m = m0 + kX,
(4.24)
where k is the extinction coefﬁcient.
The extinction coefﬁcient can be determined
by observing the same source several times dur-
ing a night with as wide a zenith distance range
as possible. The observed magnitudes are plot-
ted in a diagram as a function of the air mass X.
The points lie on a straight line the slope of
which gives the extinction coefﬁcient k. When
this line is extrapolated to X = 0, we get the mag-
nitude m0, which is the apparent magnitude out-
side the atmosphere.
In practice, observations with zenith distances
higher than 70◦(or altitudes less than 20◦) are
not used to determine k and m0, since at low al-
titudes the curvature of the atmosphere begins to
complicate matters. The value of the extinction
coefﬁcient k depends on the observation site and
time and also on the wavelength, since extinction
increases strongly towards short wavelengths.

Examples
Example 4.1 Show that intensity is independent
of distance.
Suppose we have some radiation leaving the
surface element dA in the direction θ. The energy
entering the solid angle dω in time dt is
dE = I cosθ dAdω dt,
where I is the intensity. If we have another sur-
face dA′ at a distance r receiving this radiation
from direction θ′, we have
dω = dA′ cosθ′/r2.
The deﬁnition of the intensity gives
dE = I ′ cosθ′ dA′ dω′ dt,
where I ′ is the intensity at dA′ and
dω′ = dAcosθ/r2.

Example 4.2 (Surface Brightness of the Sun)
Assume that the Sun radiates isotropically. Let R
be the radius of the Sun, F⊙the ﬂux density on
the surface of the Sun and F the ﬂux density at
a distance r. Since the luminosity is constant,
L = 4πR2F⊙= 4πr2F,
the ﬂux density equals
F = F⊙
R2
r2 .
At a distance r ≫R, the Sun subtends a solid
angle
ω = A
r2 = πR2
r2 ,
where A = πR2 is the cross section of the Sun.
The surface brightness B is
B = F
ω = F⊙

Applying (4.4) we get
B = I⊙.
Thus the surface brightness is independent of dis-
tance and equals the intensity. We have found
a simple interpretation for the somewhat abstract
concept of intensity.
The ﬂux density of the Sun on the Earth, the
solar constant, is S⊙≈1370 Wm−2. The angular
diameter of the Sun is α = 32′, whence

Example 4.3 (Magnitude of a Binary Star)
Since magnitudes are logarithmic quantities, they
can be a little awkward for some purposes. For
example, we cannot add magnitudes like ﬂux
densities. If the magnitudes of the components
of a binary star are 1 and 2, the total magnitude
is certainly not 3. To ﬁnd the total magnitude, we
must ﬁrst solve the ﬂux densities from
1 = −2.5lg F1
F0
,
2 = −2.5lg F2
F0
,
which give
F1 = F0 × 10−0.4,
F2 = F0 × 10−0.8.
Thus the total ﬂux density is

We can solve the distance r from (4.12):
r = 10 pc × 10(m−M)/5 = 10 × 1010/5 pc
= 1000 pc = 1 kpc.
Example 4.6 Although the amount of interstel-
lar extinction varies considerably from place to
place, we can use an average value of 2 mag/kpc
near the galactic plane. Find the distance of the
star in Example 4.5, assuming such extinction.
Now the distance must be solved from (4.19):
8 −(−2) = 5lg r
10 + 0.002r,
where r is in parsecs. This equation cannot be
solved analytically, but we can always use a nu-
merical method. We try a simple iteration (Ap-
pendix A.7), rewriting the equation as
r = 10 × 102−0.0004r.
The value r = 1000 pc found previously is a good
initial guess:
r0 = 1000,
r1 = 10 × 102−0.0004×1000 = 398,
r2 = 693,
...
r12 = r13 = 584.
The distance is r ≈580 pc, which is much less
than our earlier value 1000 pc. This should be
quite obvious, since due to extinction, radiation
is now reduced much faster than in empty space.
Example 4.7
What is the optical thickness of
a layer of fog, if the Sun seen through the fog
seems as bright as a full moon in a cloudless sky?
The apparent magnitudes of the Sun and the
Moon are −26.8 and −12.5, respectively. Thus
the total extinction in the cloud must be A = 14.3.
Since
A = (2.5lge)τ,
we get
τ = A/(2.5lge) = 14.3/1.086 = 13.2.
The optical thickness of the fog is 13.2. In reality,
a fraction of the light scatters several times, and
a few of the multiply scattered photons leave the
cloud along the line of sight, reducing the total
extinction. Therefore the optical thickness must
be slightly higher than our value.

Radiation Mechanisms
In the previous chapters we have studied the
physical properties and detection of electromag-
netic radiation. Next we shall brieﬂy discuss con-
cepts related to emission and absorption of radi-
ation. Since we can give here only a summary of
some essential results without delving into quan-
tum mechanical explanations, the reader inter-
ested in the details is advised to consult any good
physics textbook.
5.1
Radiation of Atoms and
Molecules
Electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed
when an atom or a molecule moves from one en-
ergy level to another. If the energy of the atom
decreases by an amount E, the atom emits or
radiates a quantum of electromagnetic radiation,
called a photon, whose frequency ν is given by
the equation
E = hν,
(5.1)
where h is the Planck constant, h = 6.6256 ×
10−34 Js. Similarly, if the atom receives or ab-
sorbs a photon of a frequency ν, its energy in-
creases by E = hν.
The classical model describes an atom as
a nucleus surrounded by a swarm of electrons.
The nucleus consists of Z protons, each hav-
ing a charge +e and N electrically neutral neu-
trons; Z is the charge number of the atom and
A = Z + N is its mass number. A neutral atom
has as many electrons (charge −e) as protons.
An energy level of an atom usually refers to
an energy level of its electrons. The energy E of
an electron cannot take arbitrary values; only cer-
tain energies are allowed: the energy levels are
quantised. An atom can emit or absorb radiation
only at certain frequencies νif corresponding to
energy differences between some initial and ﬁnal
states i and f : |Ei −Ef| = hνif. This gives rise
to the line spectrum, speciﬁc for each element
(Fig. 5.1). Hot gas under low pressure produces
an emission spectrum consisting of such discrete
lines. If the same gas is cooled down and ob-
served against a source of white light (which has
a continuous spectrum), the same lines are seen
as dark absorption lines.
At low temperatures most atoms are in their
lowest energy state, the ground state. Higher en-
ergy levels are excitation states; a transition from
lower to higher state is called excitation. Usually
the excited atom will return to the lower state very
rapidly, radiating a photon (spontaneous emis-
sion); a typical lifetime of an excited state might
be 10−8 seconds. The frequency of the emitted
photon is given by (5.1). The atom may return to
the lower state directly or through some interme-
diate states, emitting one photon in each transi-
tion.
Downward transitions can also be induced
by radiation. Suppose our atom has swallowed
a photon and become excited. Another photon,
whose frequency ν corresponds to some possi-
ble downward transition from the excited state,
can now irritate the atom, causing it to jump to
a lower state, emitting a photon with the same

Radiation Mechanisms
Fig. 5.1 Origin of line spectra. (a) Emission spectrum.
Atoms of glowing gas returning from excited states to
lower states emit photons with frequencies corresponding
to the energy difference of the states. Each element emits
its own characteristic wavelengths, which can be mea-
sured by spreading the light into a spectrum with a prism
or diffraction grating. (b) Absorption spectrum. When
white light containing all wavelengths travels through gas,
the wavelengths characteristic of the gas are absorbed
frequency ν. This is called induced or stimulated
emission. Photons emitted spontaneously leave
the atom randomly in all directions with random
phases: the radiation is isotropic and incoherent.
Induced radiation, on the other hand, is coherent;
it propagates in the same direction as and in phase
with the inducing radiation.
Also collisions of atoms cause transitions
up and down. In these transitions photons are
not emitted, instead the kinetic energies of the
atoms are changed. (An upward transition can, of
course, cause e.g. a spontaneous emission.) The
higher the density of the gas the more dominant
the collisional transitions are.
The zero level of the energy states is usually
chosen so that a bound electron has negative en-
ergy and a free electron positive energy (cf. the
energy integral of planetary orbits, Chap. 6). If
an electron with energy E < 0 receives more en-
ergy than |E|, it will leave the atom, which be-
comes an ion. In astrophysics ionisation is often
called a bound-free transition (Fig. 5.2). Unlike
Fig. 5.2 Different kinds of transitions between energy
levels. Absorption and emission occur between two bound
states, whereas ionisation and recombination occur be-
tween a bound and a free state. Interaction of an atom with
an free electron can result in a free–free transition
in excitation all values of energy (E > 0) are now
possible. The extraneous part of the absorbed en-
ergy goes to the kinetic energy of the liberated
electron. The inverse process, in which an atom
captures a free electron, is the recombination or
free–bound transition.

5.2
The Hydrogen Atom
105
Fig. 5.3 Polarisation of light. The light of an incandes-
cent bulb contains all possible directions of vibration and
is therefore unpolarised. Some crystals, for example, pass
electric ﬁelds oscillating only in certain directions, and the
transmitted part of the light becomes linearly polarised.
E is the electric ﬁeld and B the magnetic ﬁeld
When an electron scatters from a nucleus or an
ion without being captured, the electromagnetic
interaction can change the kinetic energy of the
electron producing free–free radiation. In a very
hot gas (T > 106 K) hydrogen is fully ionised,
and the free–free radiation is the most important
source of emission. It is then usually called ther-
mal bremsstrahlung. The latter part of the name
derives from the fact that decelerating electrons
hitting the anode of an X-ray tube emit similar ra-
diation. In an analogous way the absorption pro-
cess can be called a bound–bound transition.
Electromagnetic radiation is transverse wave
motion; the electric and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate
perpendicular to each other and also perpendic-
ular to the direction of propagation. The light of
an ordinary incandescent lamp has a random dis-
tribution of electric ﬁelds vibrating in all direc-
tions. If the directions of electric ﬁelds in the
plane perpendicular to the direction of propaga-
tion are not evenly distributed, the radiation is
polarised (Fig. 5.3). The direction of polarisation
of linearly polarised light means the plane deter-
mined by the electric vector and the direction of
the light ray. If the electric vector describes a cir-
cle, the radiation is circularly polarised. If the
amplitude of the electric ﬁeld varies at the same
time, the polarisation is elliptic.
If polarised radiation travels through a mag-
netic ﬁeld, the direction of the polarisation will
rotate. The amount of such Faraday rotation is
proportional to the component of the magnetic
ﬁeld parallel to the line of sight, number of elec-
trons along the line of sight, distance travelled,
and square of the wavelength of the radiation.
Scattering is an absorption followed by an
instantaneous emission at the same wavelength
but usually in a new direction. On the macro-
scopic scale, radiation seems to be reﬂected by
the medium. The light coming from the sky is
sunlight scattered from atmospheric molecules.
Scattered light is always polarised, the degree of
polarisation being highest in the direction perpen-
dicular to the direction of the original radiation.
5.2
The Hydrogen Atom
The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom, consist-
ing of a proton and an electron. According to the
Bohr model the electron orbits the proton in a cir-
cular orbit. (In spite of the fact that this model has
very little to do with reality, it can be successfully
used to predict some properties of the hydrogen
atom.) Bohr’s ﬁrst postulate says that the angu-
lar momentum of the electron must be a multiple
of ℏ:
mvr = nℏ,
(5.2)
where
m = mass of the electron,
v = speed of the electron,
r = radius of the orbit,
n = the principal quantum number,
n = 1,2,3,...,
ℏ= h/2π,
h = the Planck constant.
The quantum mechanical interpretation of
Bohr’s ﬁrst postulate is obvious: the electron is
represented as a standing wave, and the “length
of the orbit” must be a multiple of the de Broglie
wavelength, λ = ℏ/p = ℏ/mv.
A charged particle in a circular orbit (and thus
in accelerated motion) should emit electromag-
netic radiation, losing energy, were it to obey the
rules of classical electrodynamics. Therefore our
electron should spiral down towards the nucleus.
But obviously, Nature does not behave this way,
and we have to accept Bohr’s second postulate,
which says that an electron moving in an allowed
orbit around a nucleus does not radiate. Radia-

a higher energy state to a lower one. The emitted
quantum has an energy hν, equal to the energy
difference of these states:
hν = En2 −En1.

Equation (5.8) was derived experimentally for
n1 = 2 by Johann Jakob Balmer as early as 1885.
That is why we call the set of lines produced by
transitions En →E2 the Balmer series. These
lines are in the visible part of the spectrum. For
historical reasons the Balmer lines are often de-
noted by symbols Hα, Hβ, Hγ etc. If the elec-
tron returns to its ground state (En →E1), we
get the Lyman series, which is in the ultravio-
let. The other series with speciﬁc names are the
Paschen series (n1 = 3), Bracket series (n1 = 4)
and Pfund series (n1 = 5) (see Fig. 5.4).
5.3
Line Proﬁles
The previous discussion suggests that spectral
lines would be inﬁnitely narrow and sharp. In re-
ality, however, they are somewhat broadened. We
will now consider brieﬂy the factors affecting the
shape of a spectral line, called a line proﬁle. An
exact treatment would take us too deep into quan-
tum mechanics, so we cannot go into the details
here.
According to quantum mechanics everything
cannot be measured accurately at the same time.
For example, even in principle, there is no way
to determine the x coordinate and the momen-
tum px in the direction of the x axis with arbi-
trary precision simultaneously. These quantities
Fig. 5.5 Each spectral line has its characteristic natural
width (solid line). Motions of particles broaden the line
further due to the Doppler effect, resulting in the Voigt
proﬁle (dashed line). Both proﬁles have the same area
have small uncertainties x and px, such that
xpx ≈ℏ.
A similar relation holds for other directions, too.
Time and energy are also connected by an uncer-
tainty relation,
Et ≈ℏ.
The natural width of spectral lines is a conse-
quence of this Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
If the average lifetime of an excitation state
is T , the energy corresponding to the transi-
tion can only be determined with an accuracy
of E = ℏ/T = h/(2πT ). From (5.1) it follows
that ν = E/h. In fact, the uncertainty of the
energy depends on the lifetimes of both the ini-
tial and ﬁnal states. The natural width of a line is
deﬁned as
γ = Ei + Ef
ℏ
= 1
Ti

Tf
.
(5.9)
It can be shown that the corresponding line proﬁle
is
Iν = γ
2π
I0
(ν −ν0)2 + γ 2/4,
(5.10)

108
5
Radiation Mechanisms
where ν0 is the frequency at the centre of the line
and I0 the total intensity of the line. At the centre
of the line the intensity per frequency unit is
Iν0 = 2
πγ I0,
and at the frequency ν = ν0 + γ/2,
Iν0+γ/2 = 1
πγ I0 = 1
2Iν0.
Thus the width γ is the width of the line proﬁle
at a depth where the intensity is half of the max-
imum. This is called the full width at half maxi-
mum (FWHM).
Doppler Broadening
Atoms of a gas are mov-
ing the faster the higher the temperature of the
gas. Thus spectral lines arising from individual
atoms are shifted by the Doppler effect. The ob-
served line consists of a collection of lines with
different Doppler shifts, and the shape of the line
depends on the number of atoms with different
velocities.
Each Doppler shifted line has its character-
istic natural width. The resulting line proﬁle is
obtained by giving each Doppler shifted line
a weight proportional to the number of atoms
given by the velocity distribution and integrat-
ing over all velocities. This gives rise to the Voigt
proﬁle (Fig. 5.5), which already describes most
spectral lines quite well. The shapes of different
proﬁles don’t seem very different; the most ob-
vious consequence of the broadening is that the
maximum depth decreases.
One way to describe the width of a line is to
give its full width at half maximum (Fig. 5.6).
Due to Doppler broadening this is usually greater
than the natural width. The equivalent width is
another measure of a line strength. It is the area
of a rectangular line that has the same area as
the line proﬁle and that emits no light at all. The
equivalent width can be used to describe the en-
ergy corresponding to a line independently of the
shape of the line proﬁle.
Fig. 5.6 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
a spectral line is the width at the depth where the inten-
sity is half of the maximum. The equivalent width W is
deﬁned so that the line and the shaded rectangle have the
same area in the picture. The two measures are not gen-
erally the same, although they usually are close to each
other

Quantum Numbers, Selection
Rules, Population Numbers
Quantum Numbers
The Bohr model needs
only one quantum number, n, to describe all the
energy levels of the electron. This can explain
only the coarse features of an atom with a single
electron.
Quantum mechanics describes the electron as
a three dimensional wave, which only gives the
probability of ﬁnding the electron in a certain
place. Quantum mechanics has accurately pre-
dicted all the energy levels of hydrogen atoms.
The energy levels of heavier atoms and molecules
can also be computed; however, such calculations
are very complicated. Also the existence of quan-
tum numbers can be understood from the quan-
tum mechanical point of view.
The quantum mechanical description involves
four quantum numbers, one of which is our n, the
principal quantum number. The principal quan-
tum number describes the quantised energy lev-
els of the electron. The classical interpretation of
discrete energy levels allows only certain orbits
given by (5.6). The orbital angular momentum of
the electron is also quantised. This is described by
the angular momentum quantum number l. The
angular momentum corresponding to a quantum
number l is
L =

l(l + 1)ℏ.

5.4
Quantum Numbers, Selection Rules, Population Numbers
109
The classical analogy would be to allow some el-
liptic orbits. The quantum number l can take only
the values
l = 0,1,...,n −1.
For historical reasons, these are often denoted by
the letters s, p, d, f , g, h, i, j.
Although l determines the magnitude of the
angular momentum, it does not give its direction.
In a magnetic ﬁeld this direction is important,
since the orbiting electron also generates a tiny
magnetic ﬁeld. In any experiment, only one com-
ponent of the angular momentum can be mea-
sured at a time. In a given direction z (e.g. in the
direction of the applied magnetic ﬁeld), the pro-
jection of the angular momentum can have only
the values
Lz = mlℏ,
where ml is the magnetic quantum number
ml = 0,±1,±2,...,±l.
The magnetic quantum number is responsible
for the splitting of spectral lines in strong mag-
netic ﬁelds, known as the Zeeman effect. For ex-
ample, if l = 1, ml can have 2l + 1 = 3 different
values. Thus, the line arising from the transition
l = 1 →l = 0 will split into three components in
a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 5.7).
The fourth quantum number is the spin de-
scribing the intrinsic angular momentum of the
electron. The spin of the electron is
S =

s(s + 1)ℏ,
where the spin quantum number is s = 1
2. In
a given direction z, the spin is
Sz = msℏ,
where ms can have one of the two values:
ms = ±1
2.
All particles have a spin quantum number. Par-
ticles with an integral spin are called bosons (pho-
ton, mesons); particles with a half-integral spin
Fig. 5.7 The Zeeman effect. In strong magnetic ﬁelds
each energy level of a hydrogen atom splits into (2l + 1)
separate levels, which correspond to different values of
the magnetic quantum number ml = l, l −1,...,−l. The
energy differences of the successive levels have the same
constant value E. For example the p state (l = 1) splits
into three and the d state (l = 2) into ﬁve sublevels. The
selection rules require that in electric dipole transitions
ml equals 0 or ±1, and only nine different transitions
between p and d states are possible. Moreover, the transi-
tions with the same ml have the same energy difference.
Thus the spectrum has only three separate lines
are fermions (proton, neutron, electron, neutrino
etc.).
Classically, spin can be interpreted as the ro-
tation of a particle; this analogy, however, should
not be taken too literally.
The total angular momentum J of an electron
is the sum of its orbital and spin angular momen-
tum:
J = L + S.
Depending on the mutual orientation of the vec-
tors L and S the quantum number j of total an-
gular momentum can have one of two possible
values,
j = l ± 1
2
(except if l = 0, when j = 1
2). The z component
of the total angular momentum can have the val-
ues
mj = 0,±1,±2,... ± j.

110

Radiation Mechanisms
Spin also gives rise to the ﬁne structure of
spectral lines. Lines appear as close pairs or dou-
blets.
Selection Rules
The state of an electron can-
not change arbitrarily; transitions are restricted
by selection rules, which follow from certain con-
servation laws. The selection rules express how
the quantum numbers must change in a transi-
tion. Most probable are the electric dipole transi-
tions, which make the atom behave like an oscil-
lating dipole. The conservation laws require that
in a transition we have
l = ±1,
ml = 0,±1.
In terms of the total angular momentum the se-
lection rules are
l = ±1,
j = 0,±1,
mj = 0,±1.
The probabilities of all other transitions are
much smaller, and they are called forbidden tran-
sitions; examples are magnetic dipole transitions
and all quadrupole and higher multipole transi-
tions.
Spectral lines originating in forbidden transi-
tions are called forbidden lines. The probability
of such a transition is so low that under normal
circumstances, the transition cannot take place
before collisions force the electron to change
state. Forbidden lines are possible only if the gas
is extremely rareﬁed (like in auroras and plane-
tary nebulae).
The spins of an electron and nucleus of a hy-
drogen atom can be either parallel or antipar-
allel (Fig. 5.8). The energy of the former state
is 0.0000059 eV higher. But the selection rules
make an electric dipole transition between these
states impossible. The transition, which is a mag-
netic dipole transition, has a very low probabil-
ity, A = 2.8 × 10−15 s−1. This means that the av-
erage lifetime of the higher state is T = 1/A =
11 × 106 years. Usually collisions change the
state of the electron well before this period of
time has elapsed. But in interstellar space the den-
sity of hydrogen is so low and the total amount of

of the electron and the proton may be either parallel or
opposite. The energy of the former state is slightly larger.
The wavelength of a photon corresponding to a transition
between these states is 21 cm
hydrogen so great that a considerable number of
these transitions can take place.
The wavelength of the radiation emitted by
this transition is 21 cm, which is in the radio band
of the spectrum. Extinction at radio wavelengths
is very small, and we can observe more distant
objects than by using optical wavelengths. The
21 cm radiation has been of crucial importance
for surveys of interstellar hydrogen.
Population Numbers
The population num-
ber ni of an energy state i means the number
of atoms in that state per unit volume. In ther-
mal equilibrium, the population numbers obey
the Boltzmann distribution:
ni
n0
= gi
g0
e−E/(kT ),
(5.11)
where T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann
constant, E = Ei −E0 = hν is the energy dif-
ference between the excited and ground state, and
gi is the statistical weight of the level i (it is
the number of different states with the same en-
ergy Ei). The subscript 0 always refers to the
ground state. Often the population numbers dif-
fer from the values given by (5.11), but still we
can deﬁne an excitation temperature Texc in such
a way that (5.11) gives correct population num-
bers, when T is replaced by Texc. The excitation
temperature may be different for different energy
levels.

Molecular Spectra
The energy levels of an atom are determined by
its electrons. In the case of a molecule, there
are many more possibilities: atoms can vibrate
around their equilibria and the molecule can ro-
tate around some axis. Both vibrational and rota-
tional states are quantised. Transitions between
successive vibrational states typically involve
photons in the infrared band, while transitions be-
tween rotational states involve photons in the mi-
crowave band. These combined with transitions
of electrons produce a band spectrum, character-
istic for molecules (Fig. 5.9). The spectrum has
several narrow bands composed of a great num-
ber of lines.
5.6
Continuous Spectra
We have already mentioned some processes that
produce continuous spectra. Continuous emission
spectra can originate in recombinations and free–
free transitions. In recombination, an atom cap-
tures a free electron whose energy is not quan-
tised; in free–free transitions, both initial and ﬁ-
nal states are unquantised. Thus the emission line
can have any frequency whatsoever. Similarly,
ionisations and free–free transitions can give rise
to a continuous absorption spectrum.
Each spectrum contains a continuous compo-
nent, or continuum, and spectral lines. Some-
times, however, the lines are so closely packed
and so broad that they seem to form a nearly con-
tinuous spectrum.
When the pressure of hot gas is increased, the
spectral lines begin to broaden. At high pressure,
atoms bump into each other more frequently, and
the close neighbours disturb the energy levels.
When the pressure is high enough, the lines be-
gin to overlap. Thus the spectrum of hot gas at
high pressure is continuous. Electric ﬁelds also
broaden spectral lines (the Stark effect).
In liquids and solids the atoms are more
densely packed than in gaseous substances. Their
mutual perturbations broaden the energy levels,
producing a continuous spectrum.
5.7
Blackbody Radiation
A blackbody is deﬁned as an object that does
not reﬂect or scatter radiation shining upon it,
but absorbs and re-emits the radiation completely.
A blackbody is a kind of an ideal radiator, which
cannot exist in the real world. Yet many objects
behave very much as if they were blackbodies.
The radiation of a blackbody depends only on
its temperature, being perfectly independent of
its shape, material and internal constitution. The
wavelength distribution of the radiation follows
Planck’s law, which is a function of temperature
only. The intensity at a frequency ν of a black-
body at temperature T is
Bν(T ) = B(ν;T ) = 2hν3
c2
1
ehν/(kT ) −1, (5.12)
where
h = the Planck constant = 6.63 × 10−34 Js,
c = the speed of light ≈3 × 108 ms−1,
k = the Boltzmann constant
= 1.38 × 10−23 JK−1.
By deﬁnition of the intensity, the dimension of Bν
is Wm−2 Hz−1 sterad−1.

Radiation Mechanisms
Blackbody radiation can be produced in a
closed cavity whose walls absorb all radiation in-
cident upon them (and coming from inside the
cavity). The walls and the radiation in the cavity
are in equilibrium; both are at the same temper-
ature, and the walls emit all the energy they re-
ceive. Since radiation energy is constantly trans-
formed into thermal energy of the atoms of the
walls and back to radiation, the blackbody radia-
tion is also called thermal radiation.
The spectrum of a blackbody given by Planck’s
law (5.12) is continuous. This is true if the size of
the radiator is very large compared with the dom-
inant wavelengths. In the case of the cavity, this
can be understood by considering the radiation as
standing waves trapped in the cavity. The num-
ber of different wavelengths is larger, the shorter
the wavelengths are compared with the size of
the cavity. We already mentioned that spectra of
solid bodies are continuous; very often such spec-
tra can be quite well approximated by Planck’s
law.
We can also write Planck’s law as a function of
the wavelength. We require that Bν dν = −Bλ dλ.
The wavelength decreases with increasing fre-
quency; hence the minus sign. Since ν = c/λ, we
have
dν
dλ = −c

Bλ = −Bν

(5.15)
The functions Bν and Bλ are deﬁned in such
a way that the total intensity can be obtained in
the same way using either of them:
B(T ) =

Bν dν =

The deﬁnite integral in this expression is just
a real number, independent of the temperature.
Thus we ﬁnd that
B(T ) = AT 4,
(5.16)
where the constant A has the value
A = 2k4
c2h3
π4
15 .
(5.17)
(In order to get the value of A we have to eval-
uate the integral. There is no elementary way to
do that. We can tell those who are familiar with
all the exotic functions so beloved by theoreti-
cal physicists, that the integral can rather easily
be expressed as Γ (4)ζ(4), where ζ is the Rie-
mann zeta function and Γ is the gamma func-
tion. For integral values, Γ (n) is simply the fac-
torial (n −1)!. The difﬁcult part is showing that
ζ(4) = π4/90. This can be done by expanding
x4 −x2 as a Fourier-series and evaluating the se-
ries at x = π.)
The ﬂux density F for isotropic radiation of
intensity B is (Sect. 4.1):
F = πB
or
F = σT 4.
(5.18)
This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and the con-
stant σ (= πA) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
σ = 5.67 × 10−8 Wm−2 K−4.
From the Stefan-Boltzmann law we get a re-
lation between the luminosity and temperature of
a star. If the radius of the star is R, its surface

5.7
Blackbody Radiation
113
area is 4πR2, and if the ﬂux density on the sur-
face is F , we have
L = 4πR2F.
If the star is assumed to radiate like a blackbody,
we have F = σT 4, which gives
L = 4πσR2T 4.
(5.19)
In fact this deﬁnes the effective temperature of the
star, discussed in more detail in the next section.
The luminosity, radius and temperature of
a star are interdependent quantities, as we can see
from (5.19). They are also related to the absolute
bolometric magnitude of the star. Equation (4.13)
gives the difference of the absolute bolometric
magnitude of the star and the Sun:
Mbol −Mbol,⊙= −2.5lg L
L⊙
.
(5.20)
But we can now use (5.19) to express the lumi-
nosities in terms of the radii and temperatures:
Mbol −Mbol,⊙= −5lg R
R⊙
−10lg T
T⊙
. (5.21)
As we can see in Fig. 5.10, the wavelength of
the maximum intensity decreases with increas-
ing total intensity (equal to the area below the
curve). We can ﬁnd the wavelength λmax corre-
sponding to the maximum intensity by differen-
tiating Planck’s function Bλ(T ) with respect to λ
and ﬁnding zero of the derivative. The result is
the Wien displacement law:
λmaxT = b = const,
(5.22)
where the Wien displacement constant b is
b = 0.0028978 Km.
We can use the same procedure to ﬁnd the
maximum of Bν. But the frequency νmax thus ob-
tained is different from νmax = c/λmax given by
(5.22). The reason for this is the fact that the
intensities are given per unit frequency or unit
wavelength, and the dependence of frequency on
wavelength is nonlinear.
When the wavelength is near the maximum or
much longer than λmax Planck’s function can be
Fig. 5.10 Intensity distributions of blackbodies at tem-
perature 12,000 K, 9000 K and 6000 K. Since the ratios
of the temperatures are 4:3:2, the wavelengths of inten-
sity maxima given by the Wien displacement law are in
the proportions 1:4, 1:3 and 1:2, or 3, 4 and 6. The ac-
tual wavelengths of the maxima are 241.5 nm, 322 nm and
483 nm. The total intensities or the areas below the curves
are proportional to 44, 34 and 24
approximated by simpler expressions. When λ ≈
λmax (or hc/(λkT ) ≫1), we have
ehc/(λkT ) ≫1.
In this case we get the Wien approximation
Bλ(T ) ≈2hc2
λ5 e−hc/(λkT ).
(5.23)
When hc/(λkT ) ≪1 (λ ≫λmax), we have
ehc/λkT ≈1 + hc/(λkT ),
which gives the Rayleigh–Jeans approximation
Bλ(T ) ≈2hc2
λ5
λkT
hc = 2ckT
λ4 .
(5.24)
This is particularly useful in radio astronomy.
Classical physics predicted only the Rayleigh–
Jeans approximation. Were (5.24) true for all
wavelengths, the intensity would grow beyond
all limits when the wavelength approaches zero,
contrary to observations. This contradiction was
known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

Temperatures
Temperatures of astronomical objects range from
almost absolute zero to millions of degrees. Tem-
perature can be deﬁned in a variety of ways, and
its numerical value depends on the speciﬁc def-
inition used. All these different temperatures are
needed to describe different physical phenomena,
and often there is no unique ‘true’ temperature.
Often the temperature is determined by com-
paring the object, a star for instance, with a black-
body. Although real stars do not radiate exactly
like blackbodies, their spectra can usually be ap-
proximated by blackbody spectra after the effect
of spectral lines has been eliminated. The result-
ing temperature depends on the exact criterion
used to ﬁt Planck’s function to observations.
The most important quantity describing the
surface temperature of a star is the effective tem-
perature Te. It is deﬁned as the temperature of
a blackbody which radiates with the same total
ﬂux density as the star. Since the effective temper-
ature depends only on the total radiation power
integrated over all frequencies, it is well deﬁned
for all energy distributions even if they deviate far
from Planck’s law.
In the previous section we derived the Stefan-
Boltzmann law, which gives the total ﬂux den-
sity as a function of the temperature. If we now
ﬁnd a value Te of the temperature such that the
Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the correct ﬂux den-
sity F on the surface of the star, we have found
the effective temperature. The ﬂux density on the
surface is
F = σT 4
e .
(5.25)
The total ﬂux is L = 4πR2F , where R is the ra-
dius of the star, and the ﬂux density at a distance r
is
F ′ =
L
4πr2 = R2
r2 F =
α
2
2
σT 4
e ,
(5.26)
where α = 2R/r is the observed angular diame-
ter of the star. For direct determination of the ef-
fective temperature, we have to measure the total
ﬂux density and the angular diameter of the star.
This is possible only in the few cases in which the
diameter has been found by interferometry.
If we assume that at some wavelength λ the
ﬂux density Fλ on the surface of the star is ob-
tained from Planck’s law, we get the brightness
temperature Tb. In the isotropic case we have then
Fλ = πBλ(Tb). If the radius of the star is R and
distance from the Earth r, the observed ﬂux den-
sity is
F ′
λ = R2
r2 Fλ.
Again Fλ can be determined only if the angu-
lar diameter α is known. The brightness tempera-
ture Tb can then be solved from
F ′
λ =
α

2
πBλ(Tb).
(5.27)
Since the star does not radiate like a blackbody,
its brightness temperature depends on the partic-
ular wavelength used in (5.27).
In radio astronomy, brightness temperature is
used to express the intensity (or surface bright-
ness) of the source. If the intensity at frequency ν
is Iν, the brightness temperature is obtained from
Iν = Bν(Tb).
Tb gives the temperature of a blackbody with the
same surface brightness as the observed source.
Since radio wavelengths are very long, the
condition hν ≪kT of the Rayleigh–Jeans ap-
proximation is usually satisﬁed (except for mil-
limetre and submillimetre bands), and we can
write Planck’s law as
Bν(Tb) = 2hν3
c2
1
ehν/(kTb) −1
= 2hν3
c2
1
1 + hν/(kTb) + ··· −1

Thus we get the following expression for the ra-
dio astronomical brightness temperature:

A measure of the signal registered by a radio
telescope is the antenna temperature TA. After

ratio of the ﬂux densities at wavelengths λ1 and λ2 gives
the temperature of a blackbody with the same ratio. In gen-
eral the result depends on the wavelengths chosen
the antenna temperature is measured, we get the
brightness temperature from
TA = ηTb,
(5.29)
where η is the beam efﬁciency of the antenna
(typically 0.4 ≲η ≲0.8). Equation (5.29) holds
if the source is wide enough to cover the whole
beam, i.e. the solid angle ΩA from which the an-
tenna receives radiation. If the solid angle sub-
tended by the source, ΩS, is smaller than ΩA, the
observed antenna temperature is
TA = η ΩS
ΩA
Tb
(ΩS < ΩA).
(5.30)
The colour temperature Tc can be determined
even if the angular diameter of the source is un-
known (Fig. 5.11). We only have to know the
relative energy distribution in some wavelength
range [λ1,λ2]; the absolute value of the ﬂux is not
needed. The observed ﬂux density as a function
of wavelength is compared with Planck’s func-
tion at different temperatures. The temperature
giving the best ﬁt is the colour temperature in the
interval [λ1,λ2]. The colour temperature is usu-
ally different for different wavelength intervals,
since the shape of the observed energy distribu-
tion may be quite different from the blackbody
spectrum.
A simple method for ﬁnding a colour tem-
perature is the following. We measure the ﬂux
density F ′
λ at two wavelengths λ1 and λ2. If
we assume that the intensity distribution follows
Planck’s law, the ratio of these ﬂux densities must
be the same as the ratio obtained from Planck’s
law:
F ′

F ′
λ2(T ) = Bλ1(T )
Bλ2(T ) = λ5

λ5

ehc/(λ2kT ) −1
ehc/(λ1kT ) −1. (5.31)
The temperature T solved from this equation is
a colour temperature.
The observed ﬂux densities correspond to cer-
tain magnitudes mλ1 and mλ2. The deﬁnition of
magnitudes gives
mλ1 −mλ2 = −2.5lg

where the constant term is a consequence of the

the temperature is not too high, we can use the

This can be written as
mλ1 −mλ2 = a + b/Tc,
(5.32)
where a and b are constants. This shows that
there is a simple relationship between the differ-
ence of two magnitudes and the colour tempera-
ture.
Strictly speaking, the magnitudes in (5.32) are
monochromatic, but the same relation can be also
used with broadband magnitudes like B and V . In
that case, the two wavelengths are essentially the
effective wavelengths of the B and V bands. The
constant is chosen so that B −V = 0 for stars
of the spectral type A0 (see Chap. 9). Thus the
colour index B −V also gives a colour tempera-
ture.
The kinetic temperature Tk, is related to the
average speed of gas molecules. The kinetic en-
ergy of an ideal gas molecule as a function of

116
5
Radiation Mechanisms
temperature follows from the kinetic gas theory:
Kinetic energy = 1
2mv2 = 3
2kTk.
Solving for Tk we get
Tk = mv2
3k ,
(5.33)
where m is the mass of the molecule, v its average
velocity (or rather its r.m.s velocity, which means
that v2 is the average of the squared velocities),
and k, the Boltzmann constant. For ideal gases
the pressure is directly proportional to the kinetic
temperature (cf. Box 11.1):
P = nkTk,
(5.34)
where n is the number density of the molecules
(molecules per unit volume). We previously de-
ﬁned the excitation temperature Texc as a tem-
perature which, if substituted into the Boltzmann
distribution (5.11), gives the observed population
numbers. If the distribution of atoms in different
levels is a result of mutual collisions of the atoms
only, the excitation temperature equals the kinetic
temperature, Texc = Tk.
The ionisation temperature Ti is found by
comparing the number of atoms in different states
of ionisation. Since stars are not exactly black-
bodies, the values of excitation and ionisation
temperatures usually vary, depending on the el-
ement whose spectral lines were used for temper-
ature determination.
In thermodynamic equilibrium all these vari-
ous temperatures are equal.
5.9
Other Radiation Mechanisms
The radiation of a gas in thermodynamic equi-
librium depends on the temperature and den-
sity only. In astrophysical objects deviations from
thermodynamic equilibrium are, however, quite
common. Some examples of non-thermal radia-
tion arising under such conditions are mentioned
in the following.
Maser and Laser
(See Fig. 5.12.) The Boltz-
mann distribution (5.11) shows that usually there
Fig. 5.12 The operational principle of the maser and the
laser. A metastable state (a state with a relatively long av-
erage lifetime) stores atoms where they accumulate; there
are more atoms in the metastable state than in the ground
state. This population inversion is maintained by radia-
tively exciting atoms to a higher excitation state (“pump-
ing”), from which they spontaneously jump down to the
metastable state. When the atoms are illuminated by pho-
tons with energies equal to the excitation energy of the
metastable state, the photons will induce more radiation
of the same wavelength, and the radiation is ampliﬁed in
geometric progression
are fewer atoms in excited states than in the
ground state. There are, however, means to pro-
duce a population inversion, an excited state con-
taining more atoms than the ground state. This
inversion is essential for both the maser and the
laser (Microwave/Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimu-
lated Emission of Radiation). If the excited atoms
are now illuminated with photons having ener-
gies equal to the excitation energy, the radia-
tion will induce downward transitions. The num-
ber of photons emitted greatly exceeds the num-
ber of absorbed photons, and radiation is ampli-
ﬁed. Typically the excited state is a metastable
state, a state with a very long average lifetime,
which means that the contribution of spontaneous
emission is negligible. Therefore the resulting
radiation is coherent and monochromatic. Sev-
eral maser sources have been found in interstel-
lar molecular clouds and dust envelopes around
stars.

5.10
Radiative Transfer
117
Synchrotron Radiation
A free charge in ac-
celerated motion will emit electromagnetic radi-
ation. Charged particles moving in a magnetic
ﬁeld follow helices around the ﬁeld lines. As seen
from the direction of the ﬁeld, the motion is circu-
lar and therefore accelerated. The moving charge
will radiate in the direction of its velocity vector.
Such radiation is called synchrotron radiation. It
will be further discussed in Chap. 16.
5.10
Radiative Transfer
Propagation of radiation in a medium, also called
radiative transfer, is one of the basic problems of
astrophysics. The subject is too complicated to
be discussed here in any detail. The fundamental
equation of radiative transfer is, however, easily
derived.
Assume we have a small cylinder, the bottom
of which has an area dA and the length of which
is dr. Let Iν be the intensity of radiation perpen-
dicular to the bottom surface going into a solid
angle dω ([Iν] = Wm−2 Hz−1 sterad−1). If the
intensity changes by an amount dIν in the dis-
tance dr, the energy changes by
dE = dIν dAdν dω dt
in the cylinder in time dt. This equals the emis-
sion minus absorption in the cylinder. The ab-
sorbed energy is (cf. (4.14))
dEabs = ανIν dr dAdν dω dt,
(5.35)
where αν is the opacity of the medium at fre-
quency ν. Let the amount of energy emitted per
hertz at frequency ν into unit solid angle from
unit volume and per unit time be jν ([jν] =
Wm−3 Hz−1 sterad−1). This is called the emis-
sion coefﬁcient of the medium. The energy emit-
ted into solid angle dω from the cylinder is then
dEem = jν dr dAdν dω dt.
(5.36)
The equation
dE = −dEabs + dEem
gives then
dIν = −ανIνdr + jνdr
or
dIν
αν dr = −Iν + jν
αν
.
(5.37)
We shall denote the ratio of the emission coefﬁ-
cient jν to the absorption coefﬁcient or opacity αν
by Sν:
Sν = jν
αν
.
(5.38)
Sν is called the source function. Because αν dr =
dτν, where τν is the optical thickness at fre-
quency ν, (5.37) can be written as
dIν
dτν
= −Iν + Sν.
(5.39)
Equation (5.39) is the basic equation of radia-
tive transfer. Without solving the equation, we see
that if Iν < Sν, then dIν/dτν > 0, and the inten-
sity tends to increase in the direction of propa-
gation. And, if Iν > Sν, then dIν/dτν < 0, and
Iν will decrease. In an equilibrium the emitted
and absorbed energies are equal, in which case
we ﬁnd from (5.35) and (5.36)
Iν = jν/αν = Sν.
(5.40)
Substituting this into (5.39), we see that dIν/dτν
= 0. In thermodynamic equilibrium the radiation
of the medium is blackbody radiation, and the
source function is given by Planck’s law:
Sν = Bν(T ) = 2hν3
c2
1
ehν/(kT ) −1.
Even if the system is not in thermodynamic equi-
librium, it may be possible to ﬁnd an excitation
temperature Texc such that Bν(Texc) = Sν. This
temperature may depend on frequency.
A formal solution of (5.39) is
Iν(τν) = Iν(0)e−τν +
 τν
0
e−(τν−t)Sν(t)dt.
(5.41)
Here Iν(0) is the intensity of the background radi-
ation, coming through the medium (e.g. an inter-
stellar cloud) and decaying exponentially in the
medium. The second term gives the emission in
the medium. The solution is only formal, since in
general, the source function Sν is unknown and

118
5
Radiation Mechanisms
must be solved simultaneously with the intensity.
If Sν(τν) is constant in the cloud and the back-
ground radiation is ignored, we get
Iν(τν) = Sν
 τν
0
e−(τν−t) dt = Sν

1 −e−τν
.
(5.42)
If the cloud is optically thick (τν ≫1), we have
Iν = Sν,
(5.43)
i.e. the intensity equals the source function, and
the emission and absorption processes are in
equilibrium.
An important ﬁeld of application of the theory
of radiative transfer is in the study of planetary
and stellar atmospheres. In this case, to a good
approximation, the properties of the medium only
vary in one direction, say along the z axis. The
intensity will then depend only on z and θ, where
θ is the angle between the z axis and the direction
of propagation of the radiation.
In applications to atmospheres it is customary
to deﬁne the optical depth τν in the vertical direc-
tion as
dτν = −αν dz.
Conventionally z increases upwards and the opti-
cal depth inwards in the atmosphere. The vertical
line element dz is related to that along the light
ray, dr, according to
dz = dr cosθ.
With these notational conventions, (5.39) now
yields
cosθ dIν(z,θ)
dτν
= Iν −Sν.
(5.44)
This is the form of the equation of radiative trans-
fer usually encountered in the study of stellar and
planetary atmospheres.
A formal expression for the intensity emerging
from an atmosphere can be obtained by integrat-
ing (5.44) from τν = ∞(we assume that the bot-
tom of the atmosphere is at inﬁnite optical depth)
to τν = 0 (corresponding to the top of the atmo-
sphere). This yields
Iν(0,θ) =

For a given temperature, the ﬁrst factor is con-

of the function f (x) = x5/(ex −1).

By deﬁnition, x is always strictly positive.
Hence f ′(x) can be zero only if the factor 5 −
5e−x −x is zero. This equation cannot be solved
analytically. Instead we write the equation as x =
5 −5e−x and solve it by iteration:
x0 = 5
(this is just a guess),
x1 = 5 −5e−x0 = 4.96631,
...
x5 = 4.96511.
Thus the result is x = 4.965. The Wien displace-

other per unit frequency.

Celestial Mechanics
Celestial mechanics, the study of motions of ce-
lestial bodies, together with spherical astronomy,
was the main branch of astronomy until the end
of the 19th century, when astrophysics began
to evolve rapidly. The primary task of classical
celestial mechanics was to explain and predict
the motions of planets and their satellites. Sev-
eral empirical models, like epicycles and Kepler’s
laws, were employed to describe these motions.
But none of these models explained why the plan-
ets moved the way they did. It was only in the
1680’s that a simple explanation was found for all
these motions—Newton’s law of universal gravi-
tation. In this chapter, we will derive some prop-
erties of orbital motion. The physics we need for
this is simple indeed, just Newton’s laws. (For
a review, see Box 6.1.)
This chapter is mathematically slightly more
involved than the rest of the book. We shall use
some vector calculus to derive our results, which,
however, can be easily understood with very el-
ementary mathematics. A summary of the basic
facts of vector calculus is given in Appendix A.4.
6.1
Equations of Motion
We shall concentrate on systems of only two bod-
ies. In fact, this is the most complicated case that
allows a neat analytical solution. For simplicity,
let us call the bodies the Sun and a planet, al-
though they could quite as well be a planet and
its moon, or the two components of a binary star.
Let the masses of the two bodies be m1 and m2
and the radius vectors in some ﬁxed inertial coor-
Fig. 6.1 The radius vectors of the Sun and a planet in an
arbitrary inertial frame are r1 and r2, and r = r2 −r1 is
the position of the planet relative to the Sun
dinate frame r1 and r2 (Fig. 6.1). The position
of the planet relative to the Sun is denoted by
r = r2 −r1. According to Newton’s law of gravi-
tation the planet feels a gravitational pull propor-
tional to the masses m1 and m2 and inversely pro-
portional to the square of the distance r. Since the
force is directed towards the Sun, it can be ex-
pressed as
F = Gm1m2
r2
−r
r
= −Gm1m2
r
r3 ,
(6.1)
where G is the gravitational constant. (More
about this in Sect. 6.5.)
Newton’s second law tells us that the accelera-
tion ¨r2 of the planet is proportional to the applied
force:
F = m2¨r2.
(6.2)
Combining (6.1) and (6.2), we get the equation of
motion of the planet
m2¨r2 = −Gm1m2
r
r3 .

Celestial Mechanics
Since the Sun feels the same gravitational pull,
but in the opposite direction, we can immediately
write the equation of motion of the Sun:
m1¨r1 = +Gm1m2
r
r3 .
(6.4)
We are mainly interested in the relative mo-
tion of the planet with respect to the Sun. To ﬁnd
the equation of the relative orbit, we cancel the
masses appearing on both sides of (6.3) and (6.4),
and subtract (6.4) from (6.3) to get
¨r = −μ r
r3 ,
(6.5)
where we have denoted
μ = G(m1 + m2).
(6.6)
The solution of (6.5) now gives the relative or-
bit of the planet. The equation involves the radius
vector and its second time derivative. In princi-
ple, the solution should yield the radius vector as
a function of time, r = r(t). Unfortunately things
are not this simple in practice; in fact, there is
no way to express the radius vector as a function
of time in a closed form (i.e. as a ﬁnite expres-
sion involving familiar elementary functions). Al-
though there are several ways to solve the equa-
tion of motion, we must resort to mathematical
manipulation in one form or another to ﬁgure out
the essential properties of the orbit. Next we shall
study one possible method.
6.2
Solution of the Equation of
Motion
The equation of motion (6.5) is a second-order
(i.e. contains second derivatives) vector valued
differential equation. Therefore we need six in-
tegration constants or integrals for the complete
solution. The solution is an inﬁnite family of or-
bits with different sizes, shapes and orientations.
A particular solution (e.g. the orbit of Jupiter) is
selected by ﬁxing the values of the six integrals.
The fate of a planet is unambiguously determined
by its position and velocity at any given moment;
thus we could take the position and velocity vec-
tors at some moment as our integrals. Although
Fig. 6.2 The angular momentum vector k is perpendicu-
lar to the radius and velocity vectors of the planet. Since
k is a constant vector, the motion of the planet is restricted
to the plane perpendicular to k
they do not tell us anything about the geome-
try of the orbit, they can be used as initial val-
ues when integrating the orbit numerically with
a computer. Another set of integrals, the orbital
elements, contains geometric quantities describ-
ing the orbit in a very clear and concrete way. We
shall return to these later. A third possible set in-
volves certain physical quantities, which we shall
derive next.
We begin by showing that the angular momen-
tum remains constant. The angular momentum of
the planet in the heliocentric frame is
L = m2r × ˙r.
(6.7)
Celestial mechanicians usually prefer to use the
angular momentum divided by the planet’s mass
k = r × ˙r.
(6.8)
Let us ﬁnd the time derivative of this:
˙k = r × ¨r + ˙r × ˙r.
The latter term vanishes as a vector product of
two parallel vectors. The former term contains ¨r,
which is given by the equation of motion:
˙k = r ×

−μr/r3
= −

μ/r3
r × r = 0.
Thus k is a constant vector independent of time
(as is L, of course).
Since the angular momentum vector is always
perpendicular to the motion (this follows from
(6.8)), the motion is at all times restricted to the
invariable plane perpendicular to k (Fig. 6.2).

6.2
Solution of the Equation of Motion
125
Fig. 6.3 The radial velocity ˙r is the projection of the ve-
locity vector ˙r in the direction of the radius vector r
To ﬁnd another constant vector, we compute
the vector product k × ¨r:
k × ¨r = (r × ˙r) ×

−μr/r3
= −μ
r3

(r · r)˙r −(r · ˙r)r

.
The time derivative of the distance r is equal to
the projection of ˙r in the direction of r (Fig. 6.3);
thus, using the properties of the scalar product,
we get ˙r = r · ˙r/r, which gives
r · ˙r = r ˙r.
(6.9)
Hence,
k × ¨r = −μ

˙r/r −r ˙r/r2
= d
dt (−μr/r).
The vector product can also be expressed as
k × ¨r = d
dt (k × ˙r),
since k is a constant vector. Combining this with
the previous equation, we have
d
dt (k × ˙r + μr/r) = 0
and
k × ˙r + μr/r = const = −μe.
(6.10)
Since k is perpendicular to the orbital plane,
k × ˙r must lie in that plane. Thus, e is a linear
combination of two vectors in the orbital plane;
so e itself must be in the orbital plane (Fig. 6.4).
Later we shall see that it points to the direction
Fig. 6.4 The orbit of an object in the gravitational ﬁeld of
another object is a conic section: ellipse, parabola or hy-
perbola. Vector e points to the direction of the pericentre,
where the orbiting object is closest to central body. If the
central body is the Sun, this direction is called the perihe-
lion; if some other star, periastron; if the Earth, perigee,
etc. The true anomaly f is measured from the pericentre
where the planet is closest to the Sun in its orbit.
This point is called the perihelion.
One more constant is found by computing ˙r · ¨r:
˙r · ¨r = −μ˙r · r/r3 = −μr ˙r/r3
= −μ˙r/r2 = d
dt (μ/r).
Since we also have

or

2v2 −μ/r = const = h.
(6.11)

Celestial Mechanics
Here v is the speed of the planet relative to the
Sun. The constant h is called the energy integral;
the total energy of the planet is m2h. We must not
forget that energy and angular momentum depend
on the coordinate frame used. Here we have used
a heliocentric frame, which in fact is in acceler-
ated motion.
So far, we have found two constant vectors and
one constant scalar. It looks as though we already
have seven integrals, i.e. one too many. But not all
of these constants are independent; speciﬁcally,
the following two relations hold:
k · e = 0,
(6.12)
μ2
e2 −1

= 2hk2,
(6.13)
where e and k are the lengths of e and k. The
ﬁrst equation is obvious from the deﬁnitions of e
and k. To prove (6.13), we square both sides of
(6.10) to get
μ2e2 = (k× ˙r)·(k× ˙r)+μ2 r · r
r2 +2(k× ˙r)· μr
r .
Since k is perpendicular to ˙r, the length of
k × ˙r is |k||˙r| = kv and (k × ˙r) · (k × ˙r) = k2v2.
Thus, we have
μ2e2 = k2v2 + μ2 + 2μ
r (k × ˙r · r).
The last term contains a scalar triple product,
where we can exchange the dot and cross to get
k · ˙r × r. Next we reverse the order of the two
last factors. Because the vector product is anti-
commutative, we have to change the sign of the
product:
μ2
e2 −1

= k2v2 −2μ
r (k · r × ˙r)
= k2v2 −2μ
r k2
= 2k2
1
2v2 −μ


= 2k2h.
This completes the proof of (6.13).
The relations (6.12) and (6.13) reduce the
number of independent integrals by two, so we
still need one more. The constants we have de-
scribe the size, shape and orientation of the or-
bit completely, but we do not yet know where the
planet is! To ﬁx its position in the orbit, we have
to determine where the planet is at some given in-
stant of time t = t0, or alternatively, at what time
it is in some given direction. We use the latter
method by specifying the time of perihelion pas-
sage, the time of perihelion τ.
6.3
Equation of the Orbit and
Kepler’s First Law
In order to ﬁnd the geometric shape of the orbit,
we now derive the equation of the orbit. Since e is
a constant vector lying in the orbital plane, we
choose it as the reference direction. We denote the
angle between the radius vector r and e by f . The
angle f is called the true anomaly. (There is noth-
ing false or anomalous in this and other anomalies
we shall meet later. Angles measured from the
perihelion point are called anomalies to distin-
guish them from longitudes measured from some
other reference point, usually the vernal equinox.)
Using the properties of the scalar product we get
r · e = re cosf.
But the product r · e can also be evaluated using
the deﬁnition of e:
r · e = −1
μ(r · k × ˙r + μr · r/r)
= −1
μ(k · ˙r × r + μr) = −1
μ

−k2 + μr

= k2
μ −r.
Equating the two expressions of r · e we get
r =
k2/μ
1 + e cosf .
(6.14)
This is the general equation of a conic section in
polar coordinates (Fig. 6.4; see Appendix A.2 for
a brief summary of conic sections). The magni-
tude of e gives the eccentricity of the conic:
e = 0
circle,
0 < e < 1 ellipse,
e = 1
parabola,
e > 1
hyperbola.

6.4
Orbital Elements
127
Fig. 6.5 Six integration constants are needed to describe
a planet’s orbit. These constants can be chosen in vari-
ous ways. (a) If the orbit is to be computed numerically,
the simplest choice is to use the initial values of the ra-
dius and velocity vectors. (b) Another possibility is to use
the angular momentum k, the direction of the perihelion e
(the length of which gives the eccentricity), and the peri-
helion time τ. (c) The third method best describes the ge-
ometry of the orbit. The constants are the longitude of the
ascending node Ω, the argument of perihelion ω, the in-
clination i, the semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e and
the time of perihelion τ
Inspecting (6.14), we ﬁnd that r attains its mini-
mum when f = 0, i.e. in the direction of the vec-
tor e. Thus, e indeed points to the direction of the
perihelion.
Starting with Newton’s laws, we have thus
managed to prove Kepler’s ﬁrst law:
The orbit of a planet is an ellipse, one focus of
which is in the Sun.
Without any extra effort, we have shown that
also other conic sections, the parabola and hyper-
bola, are possible orbits.
6.4
Orbital Elements
We have derived a set of integrals convenient for
studying the dynamics of orbital motion. We now
turn to another collection of constants more ap-
propriate for describing the geometry of the orbit.
The following six quantities are called the orbital
elements (Fig. 6.5):
– semimajor axis a,
– eccentricity e,
– inclination i (or ι),
– longitude of the ascending node Ω,
– argument of the perihelion ω,
– time of the perihelion τ.
The eccentricity is obtained readily as the
length of the vector e. From the equation of the
orbit (6.14), we see that the parameter (or semi-
latus rectum) of the orbit is p = k2/μ. But the
parameter of a conic section is always a|1 −e2|,
which gives the semimajor axis, if e and k are
known:
a =
k2/μ
|1 −e2|.
(6.15)
By applying (6.13), we get an important relation
between the size of the orbit and the energy inte-
gral h:
a =

−μ/2h,
if the orbit is an ellipse,
μ/2h,
if the orbit is a hyperbola.
(6.16)
For a bound system (elliptical orbit), the total
energy and the energy integral are negative. For
a hyperbolic orbit h is positive; the kinetic en-
ergy is so high that the particle can escape the sys-
tem (or more correctly, recede without any limit).
The parabola, with h = 0, is a limiting case be-
tween elliptical and hyperbolic orbits. In reality
parabolic orbits do not exist, since hardly any
object can have an energy integral exactly zero.
However, if the eccentricity is very close to one
(as with many comets), the orbit is usually con-
sidered parabolic to simplify calculations.
The orientation of the orbit is determined by
the directions of the two vectors k (perpendicular

128
6
Celestial Mechanics
to the orbital plane) and e (pointing towards the
perihelion). The three angles i, Ω and ω contain
the same information.
The inclination i gives the obliquity of the or-
bital plane relative to some ﬁxed reference plane.
For bodies in the solar system, the reference plane
is usually the ecliptic. For objects moving in the
usual fashion, i.e. counterclockwise, the inclina-
tion is in the interval [0◦,90◦]; for retrograde or-
bits (clockwise motion), the inclination is in the
range (90◦,180◦]. For example, the inclination of
Halley’s comet is 162◦, which means that the mo-
tion is retrograde and the angle between its orbital
plane and the ecliptic is 180◦−162◦= 18◦.
The longitude of the ascending node, Ω, indi-
cates where the object crosses the ecliptic from
south to north. It is measured counterclockwise
from the vernal equinox. The orbital elements i
and Ω together determine the orientation of the
orbital plane, and they correspond to the direction
of k, i.e. the ratios of its components.
The argument of the perihelion ω gives the
direction of the perihelion, measured from the
ascending node in the direction of motion. The
same information is contained in the direction
of e. Very often another angle, the longitude of
the perihelion ϖ (pronounced as pi), is used in-
stead of ω. It is deﬁned as
ϖ = Ω + ω.
(6.17)
This is a rather peculiar angle, as it is measured
partly along the ecliptic, partly along the orbital
plane. However, it is often more practical than
the argument of perihelion, since it is well de-
ﬁned even when the inclination is close to zero
in which case the direction of the ascending node
becomes indeterminate.
We have assumed up to this point that each
planet forms a separate two-body system with the
Sun. In reality planets interfere with each other by
disturbing each other’s orbits. Still their motions
do not deviate very far from the shape of conic
sections, and we can use orbital elements to de-
scribe the orbits. But the elements are no longer
constant; they vary slowly with time. Moreover,
their geometric interpretation is no longer quite
as obvious as before. Such elements are osculat-
ing elements that would describe the orbit if all
Fig. 6.6 Unit vectors ˆer and ˆef of the polar coordinate
frame. The directions of these change while the planet
moves along its orbit
perturbations were to suddenly disappear. They
can be used to ﬁnd the positions and velocities of
the planets exactly as if the elements were con-
stants. The only difference is that we have to use
different elements for each moment of time.
Table C.12 (at the end of the book) gives
the mean orbital elements for the nine planets
for the epoch J2000.0 as well as their ﬁrst time
derivatives. In addition to these secular varia-
tions the orbital elements suffer from periodic
disturbations, which are not included in the ta-
ble. Thus only approximate positions can be cal-
culated with these elements. Instead of the time
of perihelion the table gives the mean longitude
L = M + ω + Ω,
(6.18)
which gives directly the mean anomaly M (which
will be deﬁned in Sect. 6.7).
6.5
Kepler’s Second and Third Law
The radius vector of a planet in polar coordinates
is simply
r = r ˆer,
(6.19)
where ˆer is a unit vector parallel with r (Fig. 6.6).
If the planet moves with angular velocity f , the
direction of this unit vector also changes at the
same rate:
˙ˆer = ˙f ˆef ,
(6.20)

6.5
Kepler’s Second and Third Law
129
where ˆef is a unit vector perpendicular to ˆer. The
velocity of the planet is found by taking the time
derivative of (6.19):
˙r = ˙r ˆer + r ˙ˆer = ˙r ˆer + r ˙f ˆef .
(6.21)
The angular momentum k can now be evaluated
using (6.19) and (6.21):
k = r × ˙r = r2 ˙f ˆez,
(6.22)
where ˆez is a unit vector perpendicular to the or-
bital plane. The magnitude of k is
k = r2 ˙f .
(6.23)
The surface velocity of a planet means the area
swept by the radius vector per unit of time. This
is obviously the time derivative of some area, so
let us call it ˙A. In terms of the distance r and true
anomaly f , the surface velocity is
˙A = 1
2r2 ˙f .
(6.24)
By comparing this with the length of k (6.23), we
ﬁnd that
˙A = 1
2k.
(6.25)
Since k is constant, so is the surface velocity.
Hence we have Kepler’s second law:
The radius vector of a planet sweeps equal areas in
equal amounts of time.
Since the Sun–planet distance varies, the or-
bital velocity must also vary (Fig. 6.7). From Ke-
pler’s second law it follows that a planet must
move fastest when it is closest to the Sun (near
perihelion). Motion is slowest when the planet is
farthest from the Sun at aphelion.
We can write (6.25) in the form
dA = 1
2k dt,
(6.26)
and integrate over one complete period:

orbital ellipse
dA = 1
2k
 P

dt,
(6.27)
Fig. 6.7 The areas of the shaded sectors of the ellipse are
equal. According to Kepler’s second law, it takes equal
times to travel distances AB, CD and EF
where P is the orbital period. Since the area of
the ellipse is
πab = πa2
1 −e2,
(6.28)
where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor
axes and e the eccentricity, we get
πa2
1 −e2 = 1
2kP.
(6.29)
To ﬁnd the length of k, we substitute the energy
integral h as a function of semimajor axis (6.16)
into (6.13) to get
k =

G(m1 + m2)a

1 −e2
.
(6.30)
When this is substituted into (6.29) we have
P 2 =
4π2
G(m1 + m2) a3.
(6.31)
This is the exact form of Kepler’s third law as
derived from Newton’s laws. The original version
was
The ratio of the cubes of the semimajor axes of
the orbits of two planets is equal to the ratio of the
squares of their orbital periods.
In this form the law is not exactly valid, even
for planets of the solar system, since their own
masses inﬂuence their periods. The errors due to
ignoring this effect are very small, however.

130

Celestial Mechanics
Kepler’s third law becomes remarkably simple
if we express distances in astronomical units (au),
times in sidereal years (the abbreviation is unfor-
tunately a, not to be confused with the semimajor
axis, denoted by a somewhat similar symbol a)
and masses in solar masses (M⊙). Then G = 4π2
and
a3 = (m1 + m2)P 2.
(6.32)
The masses of objects orbiting around the Sun
can safely be ignored (except for the largest plan-
ets), and we have the original law P 2 = a3. This
is very useful for determining distances of var-
ious objects whose periods have been observed.
For absolute distances we have to measure at least
one distance in metres to ﬁnd the length of one
au. Earlier, triangulation was used to measure the
parallax of the Sun or a minor planet, such as
Eros, that comes very close to the Earth. Nowa-
days, radiotelescopes are used as radar to very
accurately measure, for example, the distance to
Venus. Since changes in the value of one au also
change all other distances, the International As-
tronomical Union decided in 1968 to adopt the
value 1 au = 1.496000 × 1011 m. The semimajor
axis of Earth’s orbit is then slightly over one au.
But constants tend to change. And so, after 1984,
the astronomical unit has a new value,
1 au = 1.49597870 × 1011 m.
This corresponds to the radius of an object that
has the same orbital period as the Earth but that
has no mass. Since also the Earth’s mass affects
its period, the actual semimajor axis of the Earth
must be slightly bigger than one au.
Another important application of Kepler’s
third law is the determination of masses. By ob-
serving the period of a natural or artiﬁcial satel-
lite, the mass of the central body can be obtained
immediately. The same method is used to deter-
mine masses of binary stars (more about this sub-
ject in Chap. 10).
Although the values of the au and year are ac-
curately known in SI-units, the gravitational con-
stant is known only approximately. Astronomical
observations give the product G(m1 + m2), but
there is no way to distinguish between the con-
tributions of the gravitational constant and those
of the masses. The gravitational constant must be
measured in the laboratory; this is very difﬁcult
because of the weakness of gravitation. There-
fore, if a precision higher than 2–3 signiﬁcant
digits is required, the SI-units cannot be used.
Instead we have to use the solar mass as a unit
of mass (or, for example, the Earth’s mass after
Gm⊕has been determined from observations of
satellite orbits).
6.6
Systems of Several Bodies
This far we have discussed systems consisting of
only two bodies. In fact it is the most complex
system for which a complete solution is known.
The equations of motion are easily generalised,
though. As in (6.5) we get the equation of motion
for the body k, k = 1,...,n:
¨rk =
i =n

i =1,i ̸=k
Gmi
ri −rk
|ri −rk|3 ,
(6.33)
where mi is the mass of the ith body and ri its
radius vector. On the right hand side of the equa-
tion we now have the total gravitational force
due to all other objects, instead of the force of
just one body. If there are more than two bodies,
these equations cannot be solved analytically in
a closed form (Fig. 6.8). The only integrals that
can be easily derived in the general case are the
total energy, total momentum, and total angular
momentum.
If the radius and velocity vectors of all bodies
are known for a certain instant of time, the posi-
tions at some other time can easily be calculated
numerically from the equations of motion. For
example, the planetary positions needed for as-
tronomical yearbooks are computed by integrat-
ing the equations numerically.
Another method can be applied if the grav-
ity of one body dominates like in the solar sys-
tem. Planetary orbits can then be calculated as
in a two-body system, and the effects of other
planets taken into account as small perturbations.
For these perturbations several series expansions
have been derived.
The restricted three-body problem is an exten-
sively studied special case. It consists of two mas-
sive bodies or primaries, moving on circular or-

6.7
Orbit Determination
131
Fig. 6.8 When a system consists of more than two bodies,
the equations of motion cannot be solved analytically. In
the solar system the mutual disturbances of the planets are
usually small and can be taken into account as small per-
turbations in the orbital elements. K.F. Sundman designed
a machine to carry out the tedious integration of the pertur-
bation equations. This machine, called the perturbograph,
is one of the earliest analogue computers; unfortunately
it was never built. Shown is a design for one component
that evaluates a certain integral occurring in the equations.
(The picture appeared in K.F. Sundman’s paper in Fest-
skrift tillegnad Anders Donner in 1915)
bits around each other, and a third, massless body,
moving in the same plane with the primaries. This
small object does in no way disturb the motion of
the primaries. Thus the orbits of the massive bod-
ies are as simple as possible, and their positions
are easily computed for all times. The problem is
to ﬁnd the orbit of the third body. It turns out that
there is no ﬁnite expression for this orbit.
The Finnish astronomer Karl Frithiof Sund-
man (1873–1949) managed to show that a solu-
tion exists and derive a series expansion for the
orbit. The series converges so slowly that it has
Fig. 6.9 The Lagrangian points of the restricted three-
body problem. The points L1, L2 and L3 are on the same
line with the primaries, but the numbering may vary. The
points L4 and L5 form equilateral triangles with the pri-
maries
no practical use, but as a mathematical result it
was remarkable, since many mathematicians had
for a long time tried to attack the problem without
success.
The three-body problem has some interesting
special solutions. It can be shown that in certain
points the third body can remain at rest with re-
spect to the primaries. There are ﬁve such points,
known as the Lagrangian points L1,...,L5
(Fig. 6.9). Three of them are on the straight line
determined by the primaries. These points are un-
stable: if a body in any of these points is dis-
turbed, it will escape. The two other points, on
the other hand, are stable. These points together
with the primaries form equilateral triangles. For
example, some asteroids have been found around
the Lagrangian points L4 and L5 of Jupiter. The
ﬁrst of them were named after heroes of the Tro-
jan war, and so they are called Trojan asteroids.
They move around the Lagrangian points and
can actually travel quite far from them, but they
cannot escape. Figure 8.38 shows two distinct
condensations around the Lagrangian points of
Jupiter. Later similar Trojan asteroids have been
found also on the orbits of other planets.
6.7
Orbit Determination
Celestial mechanics has two very practical tasks:
to determine orbital elements from observations

132
6
Celestial Mechanics
and to predict positions of celestial bodies with
known elements. Planetary orbits are already
known very accurately, but new comets and mi-
nor planets are found frequently, requiring orbit
determination.
The ﬁrst practical methods for orbit determi-
nation were developed by Johann Karl Friedrich
Gauss (1777–1855) at the beginning of the 19th
century. By that time the ﬁrst minor planets had
been discovered, and thanks to Gauss’s orbit de-
terminations, they could be found and observed
at any time.
At least three observations are needed for
computing the orbital elements. The directions
are usually measured from pictures taken a few
nights apart. Using these directions, it is possible
to ﬁnd the corresponding absolute positions (the
rectangular components of the radius vector). To
be able to do this, we need some additional con-
straints on the orbit; we must assume that the ob-
ject moves along a conic section lying in a plane
that passes through the Sun. When the three ra-
dius vectors are known, the ellipse (or some other
conic section) going through these three points
can be determined. In practice, more observations
are used. The elements determined are more ac-
curate if there are more observations and if they
cover the orbit more completely.
Although the calculations for orbit determi-
nation are not too involved mathematically, they
are relatively long and laborious. Several meth-
ods can be found in textbooks of celestial me-
chanics.
6.8
Position in the Orbit
Although we already know everything about the
geometry of the orbit, we still cannot ﬁnd the
planet at a given time, since we do not know the
radius vector r as a function of time. The variable
in the equation of the orbit is an angle, the true
anomaly f , measured from the perihelion. From
Kepler’s second law it follows that f cannot in-
crease at a constant rate with time. Therefore we
need some preparations before we can ﬁnd the ra-
dius vector at a given instant.
The radius vector can be expressed as
r = a(cosE −e)ˆi + b sinE ˆj,
(6.34)
Fig. 6.10 Deﬁnition of the eccentric anomaly E. The
planet is at P , and r is its radius vector
where ˆi and ˆj are unit vectors parallel with the
major and minor axes, respectively. The angle E
is the eccentric anomaly; its slightly eccentric
deﬁnition is shown in Fig. 6.10. Many formulas
of elliptical motion become very simple if either
time or true anomaly is replaced by the eccentric
anomaly. As an example, we take the square of
(6.34) to ﬁnd the distance from the Sun:
r2 = r · r
= a2(cosE −e)2 + b2 sin2 E
= a2
(cosE −e)2 +

1 −e2
1 −cos2 E

= a2
1 −2e cosE + e2 cos2 E

,
whence
r = a (1 −e cosE).
(6.35)
Our next problem is to ﬁnd how to calculate E
for a given moment of time. According to Ke-
pler’s second law, the surface velocity is constant.
Thus the area of the shaded sector in Fig. 6.10 is
A = πabt −τ
P
,
(6.36)
where t −τ is the time elapsed since the peri-
helion, and P is the orbital period. But the area
of a part of an ellipse is obtained by reducing
the area of the corresponding part of the circum-
scribed circle by the axial ratio b/a. (As the math-

6.9

133
ematicians say, an ellipse is an afﬁne transfor-
mation of a circle.) Hence the area of SPX is

2ab(E −e sinE).
By equating these two expressions for the area A,
we get the famous Kepler’s equation,
E −e sine = M,
(6.37)
where
M = 2π
P (t −τ)
(6.38)
is the mean anomaly of the planet at time t. The
mean anomaly increases at a constant rate with
time. It indicates where the planet would be if it
moved in a circular orbit of radius a. For circular
orbits all three anomalies f , E, and M are always
equal.
If we know the period and the time elapsed
after the perihelion, we can use (6.38) to ﬁnd the
mean anomaly. Next we must solve for the eccen-
tric anomaly from Kepler’s equation (6.37). Fi-
nally the radius vector is given by (6.35). Since
the components of r expressed in terms of the
true anomaly are r cosf and r sinf , we ﬁnd
cosf = a(cosE −e)
r
= cosE −e
1 −e cosE ,
sinf = b sinE
r
=

1 −e2

(6.39)
These determine the true anomaly, should it be of
interest.
Now we know the position in the orbital plane.
This must usually be transformed to some other
previously selected reference frame. For exam-
ple, we may want to know the ecliptic longitude
and latitude, which can later be used to ﬁnd the

right ascension and declination. These transfor-
mations belong to the realm of spherical astron-
omy and are brieﬂy discussed in Examples 6.5–
6.7.
6.9
Escape Velocity
If an object moves fast enough, it can escape from
the gravitational ﬁeld of the central body (to be
precise: the ﬁeld extends to inﬁnity, so the object
never really escapes, but is able to recede without
any limit). If the escaping object has the mini-
mum velocity allowing escape, it will have lost
all its velocity at inﬁnity (Fig. 6.12). There its ki-
netic energy is zero, since v = 0, and the potential
energy is also zero, since the distance r is inﬁnite.
At inﬁnite distance the total energy as well as the
energy integral h are zero. The law of conserva-
tion of energy gives, then:
1
2v2 −μ
R = 0,
(6.40)
where R is the initial distance at which the object
is moving with velocity v. From this we can solve
the escape velocity:
ve =

2μ
R =

2G(m1 + m2)
R
.
(6.41)
For example on the surface of the Earth, ve is
about 11 km/s (if m2 ≪m⊕).

Celestial Mechanics
Fig. 6.12 A projectile is
shot horizontally from
a mountain on an
atmosphereless planet. If
the initial velocity is small,
the orbit is an ellipse whose
pericentre is inside the
planet, and the projectile
will hit the surface of the
planet. When the velocity
is increased, the pericentre
moves outside the planet.
When the initial velocity
is vc, the orbit is circular. If
the velocity is increased
further, the eccentricity of
the orbit grows again and
the pericentre is at the
height of the cannon. The
apocentre moves further
away until the orbit
becomes parabolic when
the initial velocity is ve.
With even higher
velocities, the orbit
becomes hyperbolic
The escape velocity can also be expressed us-
ing the orbital velocity of a circular orbit. The or-
bital period P as a function of the radius R of the
orbit and the orbital velocity vc is
P = 2πR
vc
.
Substitution into Kepler’s third law yields
4π2R2
v2c
=
4π2R3
G(m1 + m2).
From this we can solve the velocity vc in a circu-
lar orbit of radius R:
vc =

G(m1 + m2)
R
.
(6.42)
Comparing this with the expression (6.41) of the
escape velocity, we see that
ve =
√
2vc.

6.10
Virial Theorem
If a system consists of more than two objects, the
equations of motion cannot in general be solved
analytically (Fig. 6.12). Given some initial val-
ues, the orbits can, of course, be found by numer-
ical integration, but this does not tell us anything
about the general properties of all possible orbits.
The only integration constants available for an ar-
bitrary system are the total momentum, angular
momentum and energy. In addition to these, it is
possible to derive certain statistical results, like
the virial theorem. It concerns time averages only,
but does not say anything about the actual state of
the system at some speciﬁed moment.
Suppose we have a system of n point masses
mi with radius vectors ri and velocities ˙ri. We
deﬁne a quantity A (the “virial” of the system) as
follows:
A =
n

i =1
mi ˙ri · ri.
(6.44)

6.11
The Jeans Limit
135
The time derivative of this is
˙A =
n

i =1
(mi ˙ri · ˙ri + mi ¨ri · ri).
(6.45)
The ﬁrst term equals twice the kinetic energy
of the ith particle, and the second term contains
a factor mi ¨ri which, according to Newton’s laws,
equals the force applied to the ith particle. Thus
we have
˙A = 2T +
n

i =1
F i · ri,
(6.46)
where T is the total kinetic energy of the system.
If ⟨x⟩denotes the time average of x in the time
interval [0,τ], we have

.
(6.47)
If the system remains bounded, i.e. none of the
particles escapes, all ri’s as well as all velocities
will remain bounded. In such a case, A does not
grow without limit, and the integral of the pre-
vious equation remains ﬁnite. When the time in-
terval becomes longer (τ →∞), ⟨˙A⟩approaches
zero, and we get
⟨2T ⟩+

n

This is the general form of the virial theorem. If

6.11
The Jeans Limit
We shall later study the birth of stars and galax-
ies. The initial stage is, roughly speaking, a gas
cloud that begins to collapse due to its own gravi-
tation. If the mass of the cloud is high enough, its
potential energy exceeds the kinetic energy and
the cloud collapses. From the virial theorem we
can deduce that the potential energy must be at
least twice the kinetic energy. This provides a cri-
terion for the critical mass necessary for the cloud
of collapse. This criterion was ﬁrst suggested by
Sir James Jeans in 1902.
The critical mass will obviously depend on the
pressure P and density ρ. Since gravitation is the
compressing force, the gravitational constant G
will probably also enter our expression. Thus the
critical mass is of the form
M = CP aGbρc,
(6.51)
where C is a dimensionless constant, and the con-
stants a, b and c are determined so that the right-
hand side has the dimension of mass. The dimen-
sion of pressure is kgm−1 s−2, of gravitational

136
6
Celestial Mechanics
constant kg−1 m3 s−2 and of density kgm−3.
Thus the dimension of the right-hand side is
kg(a−b+c) m(−a+3b−3c) s(−2a−2b).
Since this must be kilograms ultimately, we get
the following set of equations:
a −b + c = 1,
−a + 3b −3c = 0,
−2a −2b = 0.
The solution of this is a = 3/2, b = −3/2 and
c = −2. Hence the critical mass is
MJ = C P 3/2
G3/2ρ2 .
(6.52)
This is called the Jeans mass. In order to deter-
mine the constant C, we naturally must calcu-
late both kinetic and potential energy. Another
method based on the propagation of waves de-
termines the diameter of the cloud, the Jeans
length λJ, by requiring that a disturbance of size
λJ grow unbounded. The value of the constant C
depends on the exact form of the perturbation, but
its typical values are in the range [1/π,2π]. We
can take C = 1 as well, in which case (6.52) gives
a correct order of magnitude for the critical mass.
If the mass of a cloud is much higher than MJ, it
will collapse by its own gravitation.
In (6.52) the pressure can be replaced by the
kinetic temperature Tk of the gas (see Sect. 5.8 for
a deﬁnition). According to the kinetic gas theory,
the pressure is
P = nkTk,
(6.53)
where n is the number density (particles per unit
volume) and k is Boltzmann’s constant. The num-
ber density is obtained by dividing the density of
the gas ρ by the average molecular weight μ:
n = ρ/μ,
whence
P = ρkTk/μ.
By substituting this into (6.52) we get
MJ = C

Box 6.1 (Newton’s Laws)
1. In the absence of external forces, a particle
will remain at rest or move along a straight
line with constant speed.
2. The rate of change of the momentum of
a particle is equal to the applied force F :
˙p = d
dt (mv) = F.
3. If particle A exerts a force F on another par-
ticle B, B will exert an equal but opposite
force −F on A.
If several forces F 1,F 2,... are applied on
a particle, the effect is equal to that caused by
one force F which is the vector sum of the in-
dividual forces (F = F 1 + F 2 + ···).
Law of gravitation: If the masses of particles
A and B are mA and mB and their mutual dis-
tance r, the force exerted on A by B is directed
towards B and has the magnitude GmA mB/r2,
where G is a constant depending on the units
chosen.
Newton denoted the derivative of a func-
tion f by ˙f and the integral function by f ′. The
corresponding notations used by Leibniz were
df/dt and

f dx. Of Newton’s notations, only
the dot is still used, always signifying the time
derivative: ˙f ≡df/dt. For example, the veloc-
ity ˙r is the time derivative of r, the acceleration
¨r its second derivative, etc.

Example 6.3
In an otherwise empty universe,
two rocks of 5 kg each orbit each other at a dis-

6.67 × 10−11(5 + 5) s2

whence
P = 243,000 s = 2.8 d.
Example 6.4
The period of the Martian moon
Phobos is 0.3189 d and the radius of the orbit
9370 km. What is the mass of Mars?
First we change to more appropriate units:
P = 0.3189 d = 0.0008731 sidereal years,
a = 9370 km = 6.2634 × 10−5 au.
Equation (6.32) gives (it is safe to assume that
mPhobos ≪mMars)
mMars = a3/P 2 = 0.000000322M⊙
(≈0.107M⊕).
Example 6.5 Derive formulas for a planet’s he-

elements and true anomaly.
We apply the sine formula to the spherical tri-
angle of the ﬁgure:
sinβ
sini = sin(ω + f )
sin(π/2)
or
sinβ = sini sin(ω + f ).
The sine-cosine formula gives
cos(π/2)sinβ
= −cosi sin(ω + f )cos(λ −Ω)
+ cos(ω + f )sin(λ −Ω),
whence
tan(λ −Ω) = cosi tan(ω + f ).

Example 6.6
Find the radius vector and helio-
centric longitude and latitude of Jupiter on Au-
gust 23, 1996.
The orbital elements were computed in Exam-
ple 6.1:
a = 5.2033 au,
e = 0.0484,
i = 1.3053◦,
Ω = 100.5448◦,
ω = 274.2012◦,
M = 277.7940◦= 4.8484 rad.
Since the mean anomaly was obtained directly,
we need not compute the time elapsed since peri-
helion.
Now we have to solve Kepler’s equation. It
cannot be solved analytically, and we are obliged
to take the brute force approach (also called nu-
merical analysis) in the form of iteration. For it-
eration, we write the equation as
En+1 = M + e sinEn,
where En is the value found in the nth iteration.
The mean anomaly is a reasonable initial guess,
E0. (N.B.: Here, all angles must be in radians;
otherwise, nonsense results!) The iteration pro-
ceeds as follows:
E0 = M = 4.8484,
E1 = M + e sinE0 = 4.8004,
E2 = M + e sinE1 = 4.8002,
E3 = M + e sinE2 = 4.8002,
after which successive approximations no longer
change, which means that the solution, accurate
to four decimal places, is
E = 4.8002 = 275.0◦.
The radius vector is
r = a(cosE −e) ˆi + a

1 −e2 sinE ˆj
= 0.2045 ˆi −5.1772 ˆj
and the distance from the Sun,
r = a(1 −e cosE) = 5.1813 au.
The signs of the components of the radius vector
show that the planet is in the fourth quadrant. The
true anomaly is
f = arctan −5.1772
0.2045 = 272.3◦.
Applying the results of the previous example, we
ﬁnd the latitude and longitude:
sinβ = sini sin(ω + f )
= sin1.3◦sin(274.2◦+ 272.3◦)
= −0.0026
⇒
β = −0.15◦,
tan(λ −Ω) = cosi tan(ω + f )
= cos1.3◦tan(274.2◦+ 272.3◦)
= 0.1139
⇒
λ = Ω + 186.5◦
= 100.5◦+ 186.5◦
= 287.0◦.
(We must be careful here; the equation for tan(λ−
Ω) allows two solutions. If necessary, a ﬁgure
can be drawn to decide which is the correct one.)

declination on August 23, 1996.

Examples

In Example 6.6, we found the longitude and
latitude, λ = 287.0◦, β = −0.15◦. The corre-
sponding rectangular (heliocentric) coordinates
are:
x = r cosλcosβ = 1.5154 au,
y = r sinλcosβ = −4.9547 au,
z = r sinβ = −0.0133 au.
Jupiter’s ecliptic coordinates must be trans-
formed to equatorial ones by rotating them around
the x-axis by an angle ε, the obliquity of the
ecliptic (see Box 2.1):
XJ = x = 1.5154 au,
YJ = y cosε −zsinε = −4.5405 au,
ZJ = y sinε + zcosε = −1.9831 au.
To ﬁnd the direction relative to the Earth, we
have to ﬁnd where the Earth is. In principle, we
could repeat the previous procedure with the or-
bital elements of the Earth. Or, if we are lazy,
we could pick up the nearest Astronomical Al-
manac, which lists the equatorial coordinates of
the Earth:
X⊕= 0.8815 au,
Y⊕= −0.4543 au,
Z⊕= −0.1970 au.
Then the position relative to the Earth is
X0 = XJ −X⊕= 0.6339 au,
Y0 = YJ −Y⊕= −4.0862 au,
Z0 = ZJ −Z⊕= −1.7861 au.
And ﬁnally, the right ascension and declination
are

If the values given by the Astronomical Almanac
are rounded to the same accuracy, the same result
is obtained. We should not expect a very precise
position since we have neglected all short-period
perturbations in Jupiter’s orbital elements.
Example 6.8 Which is easier, to send a probe to
the Sun or away from the Solar system?
The orbital velocity of the Earth is about
30 km/s. Thus the escape velocity from the So-
lar system is
√
2 × 30 ≈42 km/s. A probe that is
sent from the Earth already has a velocity equal
to the orbital velocity of the Earth. Hence an extra
velocity of only 12 km/s is needed. In addition,
the probe has to escape from the Earth, which re-
quires 11 km/s. Thus the total velocity changes
are about 23 km/s.
If the probe has to fall to the Sun it has to get
rid of the orbital velocity of the Earth 30 km/s. In
this case, too, the probe has ﬁrst to be lifted from
the Earth. Thus the total velocity change needed
is 41 km/s. This is nearly impossible with current
technology. Therefore a probe to be sent to the
Sun is ﬁrst directed close to some planet, and the
gravitational ﬁeld of the planet is used to acceler-
ate the probe towards its ﬁnal destination.

The Solar System
The solar system consists of a central star, called
the Sun, planets orbiting the Sun and several
smaller objects. By the solar system we mean
here and in the next chapter the system around
our own Sun. Also other stars have similar sys-
tems. They will be discussed later in Chap. 22.
This chapter deals with general properties of the
solar system. Individual objects will be discussed
in the next chapter.
Research of the solar system has evolved
rapidly since the 1960’s when space probes have
made it possible to study planets from short dis-
tances. Many methods used in geosciences are
nowadays applied also in planetary studies. Lan-
ders have been sent to the Moon, Venus, Mars,
and several smaller bodies.
The most convenient way to describe distances
in the solar system is to use astronomical units
(au), the mean distance of the Sun and Earth. One
au is = 1.49597870×1011 m (see Sect. 6.5). The
distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri is
over 270,000 au.
Actually one au is the semimajor axis of a
massless planet whose orbital period equals that
of the Earth. Since also the mass of the Earth af-
fects its motion, the semimajor axis of the Earth
is slightly larger than one au (6.32). The small
difference is, however, important only in precise
calculations.
7.1
Classiﬁcation of Objects
In addition to the Sun and Moon ﬁve objects mov-
ing relative to the stars were already known in
the antiquity: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn. They were called planets from the Greek
word meaning a wanderer. At that time also the
Sun and Moon were considered planets, and the
names of these seven objects are still reﬂected in
the names of the days of the week.
After the invention of the telescope three more
planets were found: Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.
When observational instruments and methods
have evolved, more objects orbiting behind Nep-
tune and of the same size as Pluto have been
found. Since there was no unambiguous deﬁni-
tion of a planet, some of these new objects should
have been called planets. Therefore the Interna-
tional Astronomical Union (IAU) in its General
Assembly in 2006 deﬁned three distinct cate-
gories to clarify the situation.
According to the new deﬁnition, an object is
a planet if it satisﬁes the following three condi-
tions:
(1) It orbits the Sun.
(2) It has sufﬁcient mass for its self-gravity
to overcome rigid body forces so that it
assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly
round) shape.
(3) Its perturbations have cleared away other ob-
jects in the neighbourhood of its orbit.
If a body satisﬁes the conditions (1) and (2) but
not (3), it is a dwarf planet. Since Pluto does not
fulﬁl the last requirement its status was reduced
to a dwarf planet.
All other objects orbiting the Sun shall be re-
ferred to collectively as Small Solar System Bod-
ies. These include most of the asteroids, Trans-

The Solar System
Neptunian Objects, comets, and other small bod-
ies. If the central body is not the Sun the object is
a moon or a satellite independently of its proper-
ties.
A satellite is a body which orbits the primary
body so that the centre of mass (barycentre) is
inside the primary. If this is not the case, then the
system is called a binary system. For example, in
the case of the Earth and Moon the barycentre of
the system is inside the Earth, and the Moon is
Earth’s satellite. In the Pluto-Charon system the
centre of mass is outside Pluto, and therefore they
are called a binary system.
The rules (2) and (3) are somewhat problem-
atic. How can the shape of a very distant object
be established? How wide an area a planet should
clean to be a planet, and how clean that region
should be?
Also the deﬁnition of a satellite is slightly
problematic, since the largest planets are sur-
rounded by ring systems consisting of small par-
ticles. What is the distinction between the largest
ring particles and smallest satellites? In practice,
an object could be considered a moon if it has
been observed as a separate body whose orbital
elements have been determined. In any case the
question about the exact number of satellites is
no more meaningful, since more and more will be
found when observations become more accurate.
More interesting questions are e.g. the statistical
properties of the moons.
Other unresolved questions concern the classi-
ﬁcation of the minor bodies and exoplanets. Pos-
sibly the deﬁnitions need some ﬁne-tuning in the
future.
According the current deﬁnition there are now
eight planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Nep-
tune. It looks quite improbable that more planets
will be found.
Currently there are ﬁve known dwarf planets:
Pluto that was earlier a planet, the ﬁrst asteroid
Ceres and Haumea, Makemake and Eris found
in 2004–2005 orbiting beyond Pluto. Similar ob-
jects may well be found in the future. The prob-
lem is to check whether these distant bodies sat-
isfy the conditions (2) and (3).
The solar system contains a vast number
of different small bodies. Traditionally, they
have been divided into three categories: aster-
oids, comets and meteoroids. Their differences
and properties are discussed in more detail in
Sects. 8.10–8.14.
The planets from Mercury to Saturn are bright
and well visible with a naked eye. Records of
them are found even in the most ancient writ-
ten documents. Uranus and Neptune can be seen
with a pair of binoculars. In addition to the bright
planets, only the brightest comets are visible with
a naked eye.
Gravitation controls the motion of the solar
system bodies. The planetary orbits around the
Sun (Fig. 7.1) are almost coplanar ellipses which
deviate only slightly from circles. Mercury, the
innermost planet, has the most eccentric orbit.
The orbital planes of asteroids, minor bodies
that circle the Sun mainly between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter, are often more tilted than the
planes of the planetary orbits. Asteroids and dis-
tant Trans-Neptunian Objects revolve in the same
direction as the major planets; comets, however,
may move in the opposite direction. Cometary or-
bits can be very elongated, even hyperbolic. Most
of the satellites circle their parent planets in the
same direction as the planet moves around the
Sun. Only the motions of the smallest particles,
gas and dust are affected by the solar wind, radi-
ation pressure and magnetic ﬁelds.
The planets can be divided into inferior and
superior planets depending on their orbits. Mer-
cury and Venus are inferior planets as seen from
the Earth, and planets from Mars to Neptune are
superior planets.
Depending on their physical properties the
planets can be divided into different groups
(Fig. 7.2). Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are
called terrestrial (Earth-like) planets; they have
a solid surface, are of almost equal size (diam-
eters from 5000 to 12,000 km), and have quite
a high mean density (4000–5000 kg m−3; the
density of water is 1000 kg m−3). The plan-
ets from Jupiter to Neptune are called Jovian
(Jupiter-like) or giant planets. The densities of
the giant planets are about 1000–2000 kg m−3,
and most of their volume is liquid. Diameters are
several times greater than those of the terrestrial
planets.

Planetary Conﬁgurations
To the naked eye planets look starlike dots. How-
ever, their slow motion with respect to the stars
reveals that they are bodies of our solar system.
The apparent motions of the planets look quite
complicated, partly because they reﬂect the mo-
tion of the Earth around the Sun (Figs. 7.3 and
7.4).

The Solar System
Fig. 7.3 (a) Apparent motion of Mars during the 2016

(counterclockwise with respect to the stars), but over a
month before and after the opposition the motion is retro-
grade. (b) Relative positions of the Earth and Mars. The
projection of the Earth–Mars direction on the inﬁnitely
distant celestial sphere results in (a)
Normally the planets move eastward (direct
motion, counterclockwise as seen from the North-
ern hemisphere) when compared with the stars.
When the Earth passes a superior planet, the mo-
tion of the planet reverses to the opposite or ret-
rograde direction. After a few weeks of retro-
grade motion, the direction is changed again, and
the planet continues in the original direction. It is
quite understandable that the ancient astronomers
had great difﬁculties in explaining and modelling
such complicated turns and loops. Figure 7.5 ex-
plains some basic planetary conﬁgurations.
A superior planet (planet outside the orbit of
the Earth) is said to be in opposition when it is
exactly opposite the Sun, i.e. when the Earth is
between the planet and the Sun. When the planet
is behind the Sun, it is in conjunction. In prac-
tise, the planet may not be exactly opposite or
behind the Sun because the orbits of the planet
and the Earth are not in the same plane. In astro-
nomical almanacs oppositions and conjunctions
are deﬁned in terms of ecliptic longitudes. The
longitudes of a body and the Sun differ by 180◦at
the moment of opposition; in conjunction the lon-
gitudes are equal. However, the right ascension is
used if the other body is not the Sun. Those points
where the apparent motion of a planet changes its
direction are called stationary points. Opposition
occurs in the middle of the retrograde loop.
Inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) are never
in opposition. The conﬁguration when the plan-
ets is between the Earth and the Sun is called in-
ferior conjunction. The conjunction correspond-
ing to that of a superior planet is called an upper

conjunction or superior conjunction. The maxi-
mum (eastern or western) elongation, i.e. the an-
gular distance of the planet from the Sun is 28◦
for Mercury and 47◦for Venus. Elongations are
called eastern or western, depending on which
side of the Sun the planet is seen. The planet is
an “evening star” and sets after the Sun when it is
in eastern elongation; in western elongation the
planet is seen in the morning sky as a “morning
star”.
The synodic period is the time interval be-
tween two successive events (e.g. oppositions).
The period which we used in the previous chap-
ters is the sidereal period, the true time of revolu-
tion around the Sun, unique for each object. The
synodic period depends on the difference of the
sidereal periods of the two bodies.
Let the sidereal periods of two planets be P1
and P2 (assume that P1 < P2). Their mean an-
gular velocities (mean motions) are 2π/P1 and
2π/P2. After one synodic period P1,2, the inner
planet has made one full revolution more than
the outer planet. Thus the angles travelled by the
planets are related by

(7.1)
Since Mercury and Venus move inside the or-
bit of the Earth, they show similar phases as the
Moon. The angle Sun–planet–Earth is called the
phase angle, often denoted by the Greek letter α.
The fraction of the planetary surface seen illumi-
nated depends on the phase angle. For Mercury
and Venus the phase angle can have any value be-
tween 0◦and 180◦. This means that we can see
“full Venus” (when it is behind the Sun), “half
Venus”, and so on.
The phase angle range of the superior planets
is more limited. For Mars the maximum phase
angle is 41◦, for Jupiter 11◦, and for Neptune
only 2◦.
7.3
Orbit of the Earth and Visibility
of the Sun
The rotation of the Earth and its motion around
the Sun have been used as the basis of time reck-
oning since prehistoric times (although their true

146
7
The Solar System
nature was not known then). However, these mo-
tions are not free from perturbations. Although
our modern time system is based on atomic
clocks, the ordinary time we use in our clocks
is adjusted to the rotation of the Earth by leap
seconds (Sect. 2.14).
The sidereal year is the real orbital period
of the Earth around the Sun. After one sidereal
year, the Sun is seen at the same position rela-
tive to the stars. The length of the sidereal year is
365.256363051 days of 86,400 SI seconds at the
epoch J2000.0 = 2000 January 1 12:00:00 TT.
We noted earlier that, owing to precession, the
direction of the vernal equinox moves along the
ecliptic at about 50′′ per year. This means that the
Sun returns to the vernal equinox before one com-
plete sidereal year has elapsed. This time interval,
called the tropical year, is 365.24218967 days.
A third deﬁnition of the year is based on the
perihelion passages of the Earth. Planetary per-
turbations cause a gradual change in the direc-
tion of the Earth’s perihelion. The time inter-
val between two successie perihelion passages is
called the anomalistic year, the length of which
is 365.259635864 days, a little longer than the
sidereal year. It takes about 21,000 years for the
perihelion to revolve 360◦relative to the vernal
equinox.
The equator of the Earth is tilted about 23.4◦
with respect to the ecliptic. Owing to perturba-
tions, this angle changes with time. If periodic
terms are neglected, the obliquity of the ecliptic ε
can be calculated as in Box 2.1. The obliquity
varies between 22.1◦and 24.5◦with a 41,000
year periodicity. At present the tilt is decreasing.
There are also small short term variations, like the
nutation.
The declination of the Sun varies between −ε
and +ε during the year. At any given time, the
Sun is seen at zenith from one point on the surface
of the Earth. The latitude of this point is the same
as the declination of the Sun. At the latitudes −ε
(the Tropic of Capricorn) and +ε (the Tropic of
Cancer), the Sun is seen at zenith once every
year, and between these latitudes twice a year.
The Sun crosses the equator at vernal and autum-
nal equinox.
In the Northern hemisphere the Sun will not
set if the latitude is greater than 90◦−δ, where
δ is the declination of the Sun. The southern-
most latitude where the midnight Sun can be seen
is thus 90◦−ε = 66.6◦. This is called the Arc-
tic Circle. (The same holds true in the Southern
hemisphere.) The Arctic Circle is the southern-
most place where the Sun is (in theory) below
the horizon during the whole day at the winter
solstice. The sunless time lasts longer and longer
when one goes north (south in the Southern hemi-
sphere). At the poles, day and night last half
a year each. In practise, refraction and location of
the observing site will have a large inﬂuence on
the visibility of the midnight Sun and the number
of sunless days. Because refraction raises objects
seen at the horizon, the midnight Sun can be seen
a little further south than at the Arctic Circle. For
the same reason the Sun can be seen simultane-
ously at both poles around the time of vernal and
autumnal equinox. (See also Sect. 2.6.)
The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is about
0.0167. The distance from the Sun varies between
147–152 million km. The ﬂux density of solar ra-
diation varies somewhat at different parts of the
Earth’s orbit, but this has practically no effect on
the seasons. In fact the Earth is at perihelion in the
beginning of January, in the middle of the north-
ern hemisphere’s winter.
The seasons are due to the obliquity of the
ecliptic which affects the energy received from
the Sun depends in three different ways. First the
ﬂux per unit area is proportional to sina, where
a is the altitude of the Sun. In summer the alti-
tude can have greater values than in winter, giv-
ing more energy per unit area. Another effect is
due to the atmosphere: when the Sun is near the
horizon, the radiation must penetrate thick atmo-
spheric layers. This means large extinction and
less radiation at the surface. The third factor is the
length of the time the Sun is above the horizon.
This is important at high latitudes, where the low
altitude of the Sun is compensated by the long
daylight time in summer. This last effect is ne-
glected in many textbooks written by authors not
living this far north. These effects are discussed
in detail in Example 7.2.
There are also long-term variations in the an-
nual Solar ﬂux. Serbian geophysicist Milutin Mi-
lankovi´c (1879–1958) published in the 1930’s

2–3 million years, large ice ages have recurred
approximately every 100,000 years. He proposed
that variations of the Earth’s orbit cause long-
term periodic climate change, now known as Mi-
lankovi´c cycles. Milankovi´c claimed that the cy-
cles in eccentricity, direction of the perihelion,
obliquity, and precession result in 100,000 year
ice age cycle. The cycle of precession is 26,000
years, direction of the perihelion relative to the
equinoxes is 22,000 years, and the obliquity of
the ecliptic has a 41,000 year cycle. Changes
in orbital eccentricity are not fully periodic but
some periods above 100,000 years can be found.
The eccentricity varies between 0.005–0.058 and
is currently 0.0167.
The annual incoming Solar ﬂux varies with
these orbital changes and the effect is largest at
high latitudes. If, for example, the eccentricity is
high, and the Earth is near the aphelion during the
hemisphere’s winter, then winters are long and
cold and summers are short. However, the the-
ory is controversial, orbital forcing on the climate
change is not well understood, and probably not
enough to trigger glaciation. There exist also pos-
itive feedback loops, like the effect of low albedo
of snow and ice. It means that ice reﬂects more ra-
diation back into space, thus cooling the climate.
The system is highly chaotic so that even minor
changes in the primary conditions will result in
large differences in the outcome. There are also
other effects causing climate change, including
emerging gases from large lava ﬂows and erup-
tions of volcanos and, nowadays, anthropogenic
reasons.
The future is also uncertain. Some theories
predict that the warm period will continue next
50,000 years, whereas others conclude that the
climate is already cooling. Anthropogenic rea-
sons, like ever increasing fraction of green house
gases, e.g. carbon dioxide, will change the short-
term predictions.

The Orbit of the Moon
The Earth’s satellite, the Moon, circles the Earth
counterclockwise. One revolution, the sidereal
month, takes about 27.322 days. In practise,
a more important period is the synodic month,
the duration of the Lunar phases (e.g. from full
moon to full moon). In the course of one sidereal
month the Earth has travelled almost 1/12 of its
orbit around the Sun. The Moon still has about
1/12 of its orbit to go before the Earth–Moon–
Sun conﬁguration is again the same. This takes
about 2 days, so the phases of the Moon are re-
peated every 29 days. More exactly, the length of
the synodic month is 29.531 days.
The new moon is that instant when the Moon
is in conjunction with the Sun. Almanacs deﬁne
the phases of the Moon in terms of ecliptic lon-
gitudes; the longitudes of the new moon and the
Sun are equal. Usually the new moon is slightly
north or south of the Sun because the lunar orbit
is tilted 5◦with respect to the ecliptic.
About 2 days after the new moon, the wax-
ing crescent moon can be seen in the western
evening sky. About 1 week after the new moon,
the ﬁrst quarter follows, when the longitudes of
the Moon and the Sun differ by 90◦. The right half
of the Moon is seen lit (left half when seen from
the Southern hemisphere). The full moon appears
a fortnight after the new moon, and 1 week af-
ter this the last quarter. Finally the waning cres-
cent moon disappears in the glory of the morning
sky.
The orbit of the Moon is approximately ellip-
tic.
The
length
of
the
semimajor
axis
is
384,400 km and the eccentricity 0.055. Owing
to perturbations caused mainly by the Sun, the
orbital elements vary with time. The minimum
distance of the Moon from the centre of the
Earth is 356,400 km, and the maximum distance
406,700 km. This range is larger than the one cal-
culated from the semimajor axis and the eccen-
tricity. The apparent angular diameter is in the
range 29.4′–33.5′.
The rotation time of the Moon is equal to the
sidereal month, so the same side of the Moon al-
ways faces the Earth. Such synchronous rotation
is common among the satellites of the solar sys-
tem: almost all large moons rotate synchronously.
The orbital speed of the Moon varies accord-
ing to Kepler’s second law. The rotation period,
however, remains constant. This means that, at

The Solar System
Fig. 7.6 Librations of the Moon can be seen in this pair of photographs taken when the Moon was close to the perigee
and the apogee, respectively. (Helsinki University Observatory)
different phases of the lunar orbit, we can see
slightly different parts of the surface. When the
Moon is close to its perigee, its speed is greater
than average (and thus greater than the mean ro-
tation rate), and we can see more of the right-hand
edge of the Moon’s limb (as seen from the North-
ern hemisphere). Correspondingly, at the apogee
we see “behind” the left edge. Owing to this li-
bration, a total of 59 % of the surface area can
be seen from the Earth (Fig. 7.6). The libration is
quite easy to see if one follows some detail at the
edge of the lunar limb.
There are also two other factors causing libra-
tion. When the Moon is rising from the East, we
can see a little behind the right edge, and when
the Moon is setting, behind the left edge. The
third effect is the latitudinal libration. Since the
orbit of the Moon is not quite in the equatorial
plane, we can see behind the northern or southern
pole depending on the position of the Moon.
The orbital plane of the Moon is tilted only
about 5◦to the ecliptic. Therefore the Moon is
always close to the ecliptic just like the Sun and
the planets. However, the orbital plane changes
gradually with time, owing mainly to the pertur-
bations caused by the Earth and the Sun. These
perturbations cause the nodal line (the intersec-
tion of the plane of the ecliptic and the orbital
plane of the Moon) to make one full revolu-
tion in 18.6 years. We have already encountered
the same period in the nutation. When the as-
cending node of the lunar orbit is close to the
vernal equinox, the Moon can be 23.4◦+ 5◦=
28.4◦north or south of the equator. When the de-
scending node is close to the vernal equinox, the
zone where the Moon can be found extends only
23.4◦−5◦= 18.4◦north or south of the equator.
The nodical or draconic month is the time in
which the Moon moves from one ascending node
back to the next one. Because the line of nodes is
rotating, the nodical month is 3 hours shorter than
the sidereal month, i.e. 27.212 days. The orbital
ellipse itself also precesses slowly. The orbital
period from perigee to perigee, the anomalistic
month, is 5.5 h longer than the sidereal month, or
about 27.555 days.

7.5
Eclipses and Occultations
149
Gravitational differences caused by the Moon
and the Sun on different parts of the Earth’s sur-
face give rise to the tides. Gravitation is greatest
at the sub-lunar point and smallest at the opposite
side of the Earth. At these points, the surface of
the seas is highest (high tide, ﬂood). About 6 h
after ﬂood, the surface is lowest (low tide, ebb).
The tide generated by the Sun is less than half of
the lunar tide. When the Sun and the Moon are
in the same direction with respect to the Earth
(new moon) or opposite each other (full moon),
the tidal effect reaches its maximum; this is called
spring tide.
The sea level typically varies 1 m, but in some
narrow straits, the difference can be as great as
15 m. Due to the irregular shape of the oceans,
the true pattern of the oceanic tide is very com-
plicated.
The solid surface of the Earth also suffers tidal
effects, but the amplitude is much smaller, about
30 cm.
Tides generate friction, which dissipates the
rotational and orbital kinetic energy of the Earth–
Moon system. This energy loss induces some
changes in the system. First, the rotation of the
Earth slows down until the Earth also rotates syn-
chronously, i.e. the same side of Earth will always
face the Moon. Secondly, the semimajor axis of
the orbit of the Moon increases, and the Moon
drifts away about 3 cm per year.
7.5
Eclipses and Occultations
An eclipse is an event in which a body goes
through the shadow of another body. The most
frequently observed eclipses are the lunar eclipses
and the eclipses of the large satellites of Jupiter.
An occultation takes place when an occulting
body goes in front of another object; typical
examples are stellar occultations caused by the
Moon. Generally, occultations can be seen only
in a narrow strip; an eclipse is visible wherever
the body is above the horizon.
Solar and lunar eclipses are the most spec-
tacular events in the sky. A solar eclipse occurs
when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun
(Fig. 7.7). (According to the deﬁnition, a solar
eclipse is not an eclipse but an occultation!) If the
whole disk of the Sun is behind the Moon, the
Fig. 7.7 (a) A total solar eclipse can be seen only inside
a narrow strip; outside the zone of totality the eclipse is
partial. (b) An eclipse is annular if the Moon is at apogee
from where the shadow of the Moon does not reach the
Earth. (c) A lunar eclipse is visible everywhere where the
Moon is above the horizon
Fig. 7.8 The total eclipse of the Sun occurred in 1990
over Finland. (Photo Matti Martikainen)
eclipse is total (Fig. 7.8); otherwise, it is partial.
If the Moon is close to its apogee, the apparent
diameter of the Moon is smaller than that of the
Sun, and the eclipse is annular.
If the orbital plane of the Moon coincided with
the plane of the ecliptic, one solar and one lunar
eclipse would occur every synodic month. How-
ever, the plane is tilted about 5◦; therefore, at full
moon, the Moon must be close to the nodes for
an eclipse to occur. The angular distance of the
Moon from the node must be smaller than 4.6◦

150

The Solar System
for a total lunar eclipse, and 10.3◦for a total so-
lar eclipse.
Two to seven eclipses occur annually. Usually
eclipses take place in a set of 1–3 eclipses, sepa-
rated by an interval of 173 days. In one set there
can be just one solar eclipse or a succession of
solar, lunar and another solar eclipse. In one year,
eclipses belonging to 2 or 3 such sets can take
place.
The Sun and the (ascending or descending)
node of the lunar orbit are in the same direction
once every 346.62 days. Nineteen such periods
(= 6585.78 days = 18 years 11 days) are very
close to the length of 223 synodic months. This
means that the Sun–Moon conﬁguration and the
eclipses are repeated in the same order after this
period, called for historical reasons the Saros pe-
riod; it was already known to the ancient Babylo-
nians.
A solar eclipse is total if the whole solar disk
is hidden behind the Moon. In a partial eclipse
only a part of the Sun is covered. If the Moon is
close to its apogee its apparent diameter is smaller
than the diameter of the Sun, and the eclipse is
annular.
During a solar eclipse the shadow of the Moon
on Earth’s surface is always less than 270 km
wide. The shadow moves at least 34 km/min; thus
the maximum duration of a total eclipse is 7 1
2
minutes. On both sides of the track of the total
eclipse a partial eclipse can be seen.
Also lunar eclipses can be of different kinds.
A lunar eclipse is total if the Moon is entirely in-
side the umbral shadow of the Earth; otherwise
the eclipse is partial. If the Moon does not hit
the umbral shadow but receives some sunlight,
the eclipse is difﬁcult to see with the unaided eye
because the lunar magnitude remains almost un-
changed.
A lunar eclipse can be seen on the whole hemi-
sphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The
maximum duration of a lunar eclipse is 3.8 h, and
the duration of the total phase is always shorter
than 1.7 h. During the total phase the Moon is
coloured deep red because some red light is re-
fracted through the Earth’s atmosphere.
The Moon moves eastwards, and stars are oc-
culted by the dark edge of the Moon during
the ﬁrst quarter. Therefore occultation is easier

is seen as a small dark disc in front of the Sun. (Photo H.
Karttunen)
to observe, and photometric measurements are
possible Observations of the stellar occultations
caused by the Moon formerly served as an accu-
rate method for determining the lunar orbit. Be-
cause the Moon has no atmosphere, a star disap-
pears abruptly in less than 1/50 s. If a fast pho-
tometer is used for recording the event, the typical
diffraction pattern can be seen. The shape of the
diffraction was used to determine angular diame-
ters of stars ans separations of binary stars. In the
ﬁrst decades of radio astronomy the occultations
of some radio sources were used for determining
their exact positions.
There are some bright stars and planets inside
the 11◦wide zone where the Moon moves, but the
occultation of a bright, naked-eye object is quite
rare.
Occultations are also caused by planets and as-
teroids. Accurate predictions are complicated be-
cause such an event is visible only in a very nar-
row path. The Uranian rings were found during
an occultation in 1977, and the shapes of some as-
teroids have been studied during some favourable
events, timed exactly by several observers located
along the predicted path.
A transit is an event in which Mercury or
Venus moves across the Solar disk as seen from
the Earth (Fig. 7.9). A transit can occur only when

the planet is close to its orbital node at the time
of inferior conjunction. Transits of Mercury oc-
cur about 13 times per century; transits of Venus
only twice. The next transits of Mercury are:
Nov 11, 2019; Nov 13, 2032 and Nov 7, 2039.
The next transits of Venus are: Dec 11, 2117;
Dec 8, 2125 and Jun 11, 2247. In the 18th cen-
tury the two transits of Venus (1761 and 1769)
were used for determining the value of the astro-
nomical unit.
7.6
The Structure and Surfaces of
Planets
Since the 1960’s a vast amount of data have been
collected using spacecraft, either during a ﬂyby,
orbiting a body, or directly landing on the surface.
This gives a great advantage compared to other
astronomical observations. We may even speak of
revolution: the solar system bodies have turned
from astronomical objects to geophysical ones.
Many methods traditionally used in various sib-
ling branches of geophysics can now be applied
to planetary studies.
The perturbations in the orbit of a satellite or
spacecraft can be used in studying the internal
structure of a planet. Any deviation from spher-
ical symmetry is visible in the external gravita-
tional ﬁeld. The shape and irregularities of the
gravitation ﬁeld generated by a planet reﬂect its
shape, internal structure and mass distribution.
Also the surface gives certain indications on in-
ternal structure and processes.
The IAU planet deﬁnition states that planets
are bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. Gravity of
a body will pull its material inwards, but the body
resist the pull if the strength of the material is
greater than the pressure exerted by the overly-
ing layers. If the diameter is larger than about
800–1000 km, gravity is able to deform rocky
bodies into spherical shape. Smaller bodies than
this have irregular shapes. On the other hand, e.g.
icy moons of Saturn are spherical because ice is
more easily deformed than rock.
Hydrostatic equilibrium means that the sur-
face of the body approximately follows an equi-
potential surface of gravity. This is true e.g. on the
Earth, where the sea surface very closely follows
the equipotential surface called the geoid. Due to
internal strength of rocks, continents can deviate
from the geoid surface by a few kilometers but
compared to the diameter of the Earth the surface
topography is negligible.
A rotating planet is always ﬂattened. The
amount of ﬂattening depends on the rotation rate
and the strength of the material; a liquid drop is
more easily deformed than a rock. The shape of
a rotating body in hydrostatic equilibrium can be
derived from the equations of motion. If the ro-
tation rate is moderate, the equilibrium shape of
a liquid body is an ellipsoid of revolution, rotat-
ing around its shortest axis.
If Re and Rp are the equatorial and polar radii,
respectively, the shape of the planet can be ex-
pressed as
x2
R2e
+ y2
R2e
+ z2
R2p
= 1.
(7.2)
The dynamical ﬂattening, denoted by f is deﬁned
as
f = Re −Rp
Re
.
(7.3)
Because Re > Rp, the ﬂattening f is always pos-
itive.
The giant planets are in practise close to hy-
drostatic equilibrium, and their shape is deter-
mined by the rotation. The rotation period of Sat-
urn is only 10.5 h, and its dynamical ﬂattening is
1/10 which is easily visible.
Asteroids and other minor bodies are so small
that they are not ﬂattened by rotation. However,
there is an upper limit for a rotation rate of an
asteroid before it breaks apart due to centrifugal
forces. If we assume that the body is held together
only by gravity, we can approximate the maxi-
mum rotation rate by setting the centrifugal force
equal to the gravitational force:

= mv2

distance of R from the center of the body. Substi-

(7.5)
If we substitute the density ρ with the mean den-
sity of terrestrial rocks, i.e. 2700 kg m−3, we get
for the minimum rotation period P ≈2 hours.
The
structure
of
the
terrestrial
planets
(Fig. 7.10) can also be studied with seismic
waves. The waves formed in an earthquake are
reﬂected and refracted inside a planet like any
other wave at the boundary of two different lay-
ers. The waves are longitudinal or transversal
(P and S waves, respectively). Both can propagate
in solid materials such as rock. However, only the
longitudinal wave can penetrate liquids. One can
determine whether a part of the interior material
is in the liquid state and where the boundaries
of the layers are by studying the recordings of
seismometers placed on the surface of a planet.
Naturally the Earth is the best-known body, but
quakes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars have also
been observed.
The interior temperatures of the planets are
considerably larger than the surface temperatures.
For example, the temperature in the Earth’s core
Fig. 7.10 Internal structure and relative sizes of the ter-
restrial planets. The percentage shows the volume of the
core relative to the total volume of the planet. In the case
of the Earth, the percentage includes both the outer and
the inner core
is about 4500–5000 K, and in the core of Jupiter
about 30,000 K.
A part of that heat is the remnant of the re-
leased potential energy from the gravitational
contraction during the formation of planets. De-
cay of radioactive isotopes also releases heat.
Soon after the formation of planets intense me-
teorite bombardment was an important source of
heat. Together with heat from short-lived radioac-
tive isotopes this caused melting of terrestrial
planets. The planets were differentiated: the orig-
inally relatively homogeneous material became
segregated into layers of different chemical com-
position. The heaviest elements sank into centre
thus forming a dense core.
The terrestrial planets have an iron-nickel
core. Mercury has the relatively largest core;
Mars the smallest. The density of the core is
around 10,000 kg m−3. The Fe–Ni core is sur-
rounded by a mantle, composed of silicates (com-
pounds of silicon). The density of the outermost
layers is about 3000 kg m−3. The mean density
of the terrestrial planets is 3500–5500 kg m−3.
A thin crust is the outermost layer. The crust
and the upper mantle form a solid lithosphere,
and the partly molten layer below that is the as-
tenosphere. Mean densities of planets are 3500–
5500 kg m−3, but the density of the surface ma-
terial is less than 300 kg m−3.
Rock is not a good heat conductor, but in ter-
restrial planets conduction is the only important
method to transfer from the interior to the sur-
face. Heat transfer by convection depends on the
viscosity material and the temperature gradient.
In the mantle of the Earth slow vertical convec-
tive ﬂows occur below a few hundred kilome-
tres. These ﬂows drive e.g. the motion of the tec-
tonic plates. Continental drift gives rise, for ex-
ample, to mountain formation. The Earth is the
only planet where plate tectonics is active today.
On other terrestrial planets the process has either
ceased long ago or has never occurred.
The giant planets (Fig. 7.11) do not have
a similar isolating outer layer, and convection
can transfer heat all the way to the surface.
Thus the giant planets radiate more energy than
they receive from the Sun. Saturn radiates about
2.8 times the heat it gets from the Sun, more than

7.6
The Structure and Surfaces of Planets

Fig. 7.11 Internal structure and relative sizes of the gi-
ant planets. Differences in size and distance from the Sun
cause differences in the chemical composition and internal
structure. Due to smaller size, Uranus and Neptune do not
have any layer of metallic hydrogen. The Earth is shown
in scale
any other planet. This heat is suspected to origi-
nate from the separation of hydrogen and helium,
when the heavier helium is gradually sinking to-
ward the centre of the planet. In Jupiter the heat
is mainly remnant heat from the time the planet
was born.
The mean densities of the giant planets are
quite low; the density of Saturn, for example, is
only 700 kg m−3. (If Saturn were put in a gigan-
tic bathtub, it would ﬂoat on the water!) Most of
the volume of a giant planet is a mixture of hy-
drogen and helium. In the centre, there is possibly
a silicate core, the mass of which is a few Earth
masses. The core is surrounded by a layer of
metallic hydrogen. Due to the extreme pressure,
hydrogen is not in its normal molecular form H2,
but dissociated into atoms. In this state, hydrogen
is electrically conducting. The magnetic ﬁelds of
the giant planets may originate in the layer of
metallic hydrogen.
Closer to the surface, the pressure is lower and
hydrogen is in molecular form. The relative thick-
ness of the layers of metallic and molecular hy-
drogen vary from planet to planet. Uranus and
Neptune may not have any layer of metallic hy-
drogen because their internal pressure is too low
for dissociation of the hydrogen. Instead, a layer
of “ices” surround the core. This is a layer of
a water-dominant mixture of water, methane and
ammonia. Under the high pressure and tempera-
ture the mixture is partly dissolved into its com-
ponents and it behaves more like a molten salt and
it is also electrically conductive like the metallic
hydrogen.
On top of everything is a gaseous atmosphere,
only a few hundred kilometres thick. The clouds
at the top of the atmosphere form the visible “sur-
face” of the giant planets.
Planetary surfaces are modiﬁed by several
geological processes. These include continental
drift, volcanism, meteorite impacts and climate.
The Earth is an example of a body whose surface
has been renewed many times during past aeons.
The age of the surface depends on the processes
and thus implies the geological evolutionary his-
tory of the planet.
Volcanism is a minor factor on the Earth (at
least now), but the surface of the Jovian moon Io
is changing rapidly due to violent volcanic erup-
tions (Fig. 7.12). Volcanism on Io is caused by
frictional heating by tides. Volcanoes have been
observed also on Mars and Venus, but not on the
Moon.
Lunar craters are meteorite impact craters,
common on almost every body with a solid sur-
face. Meteorites are bombarding the planets con-
tinuously, but the rate has been diminishing since
the beginnings of the solar system. The number
of impact craters reﬂects the age of the surface
(Figs. 7.13 and 7.14).
The Jovian moon Callisto is an example of
a body with an ancient surface which is not
fully inactive. Lack of small craters indicates
some resurfacing process ﬁlling and degrading
the minor surface features. The Earth is an ex-
ample of a body, whose atmosphere both pro-
tects the surface and destroys the traces of im-
pacts. All smaller meteorites are burned to ashes
in the atmosphere (one need only note the num-
ber of shooting stars), and some larger bodies are
bounced back to outer space. The traces on the
surface are destroyed very quickly by erosion in
less than a few million years. Venus is an even
more extreme case where all small craters are
missing due to a thick protective atmosphere.
Climate has the greatest inﬂuence on the Earth
and Venus. Both planets have a thick atmosphere.

On Mars, powerful dust storms deform the land-
scape, too, often covering the planet with yellow-
ish dust clouds.

Atmospheres and
Magnetospheres
All major planets have an atmosphere; the atmo-
sphere of Mercury, however, is extremely thin.
The giant planets are surrounded by a very thick
gaseous layer that can be regarded as an at-
mosphere. Saturn’s moon Titan has a relatively
thick atmosphere consisting of methane. Also the
dwarf planet Pluto has a thin atmosphere consist-
ing mainly of methane.

ture of the atmosphere vary from planet to planet,

sure dP from the height h to h + dh is pro-
portional to the mass of the gas in the cylin-
der:

sidered constant from the surface to a height of
100 km.

The variable H, which has the dimension of

H = kT
μg .
(7.10)
The scale height deﬁnes the height at which the
pressure has decreased by a factor e. H is a func-
tion of height, but here we may assume that it is
constant. With this approximation, we obtain
−h
H = ln P

or, using (7.8),
ρT (h)
ρ0T0
= e−h/H.
(7.11)
The scale height is an important parameter in
many formulas describing the structure of the at-
mosphere (Table 7.1). For example, if the change
of the pressure or the density is known as a func-
tion of height, the mean molecular weight of the
atmosphere can be computed. The scale height of
the Jovian atmosphere was determined in 1952
when Jupiter occulted a star. With these observa-
tions, the scale height was calculated to be 8 km,
and the mean molecular weight 3–5 amu (atomic
mass unit, 1/12 of the mass of 12C). Thus the
main components are hydrogen and helium, a re-
sult later conﬁrmed by spacecraft data.
In terrestrial observations, infrared data are
limited by water vapour and carbon dioxide. The
scale height of CO2 is 5 km, which means that
the partial pressure is already halved at a height
of 3.5 km. Thus infrared observations can be
made on top of high mountains (like Mauna Kea
in Hawaii). The scale height of water vapour
is 13 km, but the relative humidity and hence
the actual water content is very site- and time-
dependent.
The scale height and the temperature of the
atmosphere deﬁne the permanence of the atmo-
sphere. If the speed of a molecule is greater than

the escape velocity, the molecule will escape into
space. The whole atmosphere could disappear in
a relatively short time.
According to the kinetic gas theory, the mean
velocity v of a molecule depends both on the ki-
netic temperature Tk of the gas and the mass m of
the molecule:
v =

3kTk
m .
(7.12)
If the mass of a planet is M and its radius R, the
escape velocity is
ve =

2GM
R
.
(7.13)
Even if the mean velocity is smaller than the
escape velocity, the atmosphere can evaporate
into space if there is enough time, since some
molecules will always have velocities exceed-
ing ve. Assuming a velocity distribution, one can
calculate the probability for v > ve Hence it is
possible to estimate what fraction of the atmo-
sphere will disappear in, say, 109 years. As a rule
of thumb, it can be said that at least half of the
atmosphere will remain over 1000 million years
if the mean velocity v < 0.2ve.
Giant planets move far from the Sun; thus
the surface temperature is low. Also, the grav-
itation is strong. Thus it is understandable that
e.g. Jupiter has been able to retain more hydro-
gen than the Earth.
The probability that a molecule close to the
surface will escape is insigniﬁcantly small. The
free mean path of a molecule is very small when
the gas density is high (Fig. 7.17). Thus the escap-
ing molecule is most probably leaving from the
Fig. 7.17 Close to the surface, the mean free path of
a molecule is smaller than higher in the atmosphere where
the gas density is smaller. The escaping molecules origi-
nate close to the critical layer
uppermost layers. The critical layer is deﬁned as
a height at which a molecule, moving upward, has
a probability 1/e of hitting another molecule. The
part of the atmosphere above the critical layer is
called the exosphere. The exosphere of the Earth
begins at a height of 500 km, where the kinetic
temperature of the gas is 1500–2000 K and the
pressure is lower than in the best terrestrial vacu-
ums.
The magnetosphere is the “outer boundary” of
a planet. Size and shape depend on the strength
of the magnetic ﬁeld of the planet and on the
solar wind. The solar wind is a ﬂux of charged
particles, mostly electrons and protons, outﬂow-

ing from the Sun. The speed of the wind at the
distance of the Earth is about 500 km/s and the
density 5–10 particles/cm3 but both values can
change considerably depending on the solar ac-
tivity.
On the solar side there is a bow shock
(Fig. 7.18), typically at a distance of a few tens
of planetary radii (Table 7.2). At the bow shock,
particles of the solar wind ﬁrst hit the magne-
tosphere. The magnetosphere is limited by the
magnetopause, ﬂattened on the solar side and ex-
tended to a long tail on the opposite side. Charged
particles inside the magnetopause are captured by
the magnetic ﬁeld and some particles are accel-
erated to great velocities (Fig. 7.19). If the ve-
locities are interpreted according to the kinetic
gas theory, these velocities even correspond to
millions of kelvins. However, the density, and
thus the total energy, is very small. The “hottest”
places found are around Jupiter and Saturn, where
the particle velocities correspond even tempera-
tures of 400 million kelvins.
The region of space containing trapped char-
ged particles, the radiation belts around the Earth,
are named van Allen’s belts. These radiation
zones were discovered by the ﬁrst US satellite,
Explorer 1, in 1958.
The number of charged particles increases af-
ter strong solar bursts. Some of these particles
“leak” to the atmosphere, resulting in auroras.
Similar effects have also been detected in Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus.
The solar magnetic ﬁeld arises from the turbu-
lent motions of the electrically conductive matter.
The energy driving the convection in the layer is
coming from the nuclear fusion in the core. This,
however, cannot explain planetary magnetism.
Neither can the remanent primordial magnetic

ﬁeld explain it because the internal temperature
of planets is well above the Curie point (about
850 K for magnetite). If the temperature is above
the Curie point, ferromagnetic materials will lose
their remanent magnetism.
The planetary dynamo generating the mag-
netic ﬁeld requires that the planet is rotating and
has a convective layer of electrically conductive
material. The temperature gradient across this
layer must also be high enough to maintain con-
vection. Terrestrial planets have a liquid Fe–Ni
core, or a liquid layer in the core, Jupiter and Sat-
urn have a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen and
Uranus and Neptune have a mixture of water, am-
monia and methane.
The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld varies a lot
from planet to planet. It can be characterised
by the dipole magnetic moment. The magnetic
moment of Jupiter is about 100 million times
that of Mercury. The magnetic moment of the
Earth is about 7.9 × 1025 gausscm3 that can
be compared to the typical strong electromag-
netic ﬁelds achieved in the laboratories, about
100,000 gausscm3. Inducing such a strong ﬁeld
requires currents that are of the order of 109 Am-
peres. When divided by the cube of planetary
radii, one gets an estimate of the ﬁeld strength
on the equator.
The alignment of the magnetic ﬁeld with re-
spect to the rotation axis of a planet differs from
planet to planet (Fig. 7.20). Saturn’s magnetic
ﬁeld is close to the ideal case where rotational
axis and magnetic axis coincide. Also the Earth
and Jupiter show reasonably good point dipole
ﬁeld with a tilt of about 10◦. However, ﬁelds of

160

Fig. 7.20 Planetary magnetic ﬁelds
Uranus and Neptune are both offset from the cen-
tre of the planet and tilted by about 50◦from the
rotation axis. This may indicate a different mech-
anism for the dynamo.
The magnetic ﬁelds of Mercury and the Earth
have an opposite polarity than the ﬁelds of
other planets. It is known that the polarity of
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has reversed several
times over geologic time scales, previously about
750,000 years ago. There are some indications
that the reversal of the polarity is beginning now
because the ﬁeld strength is declining about one
percent per decade, magnetic poles are moving
more rapidly and the ﬁeld asymmetry is increas-
ing. The whole process will take several thousand
years during which the Earth’s surface is more
open to the cosmic rays.
The Galileo mission also revealed that the Jo-
vian moon Ganymede has a magnetic ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld is weak and too small to have a magneto-
tail or trapped particles around the moon. Cal-
listo, which is of the same size, does not show
any magnetosphere. Neither does our Moon have
any global magnetic ﬁeld.
7.8
Albedos
The planets and all other bodies of the solar sys-
tem only reﬂect the radiation of the Sun (we may
neglect here the thermal and radio wave radia-
tion and concentrate mainly on the visual wave-
lengths). The brightness of a body depends on its
distance from the Sun and the Earth, and on the
albedo of its surface. The term albedo deﬁnes the
ability of a body to reﬂect light.
Fig. 7.21 Symbols used in the photometric formulas. The
angle α is the phase angle
If the luminosity of the Sun is L⊙, the ﬂux
density at the distance r is (Fig. 7.21)
F = L⊙
4πr2 .
(7.14)
If the radius of the planet is R, the area of its cross
section is πR2, and the total ﬂux incident on the
surface of the planet is
Lin = πR2 L⊙
4πr2 = L⊙R2
4r2 .
(7.15)
Only a part of the incident ﬂux is reﬂected back.
The other part is absorbed and converted into
heat which is then emitted as a thermal emission
from the planet. The Bond albedo A (or spheri-
cal albedo) is deﬁned as the ratio of the emergent
ﬂux to the incident ﬂux (0 ≤A ≤1). The ﬂux re-
ﬂected by the planet is thus
Lout = ALin = AL⊙R2

.

ation is reﬂected isotropically, the observed ﬂux

density should be
F = Lout
4π2 .
(7.17)
In reality, however, radiation is reﬂected aniso-
tropically. If we assume that the reﬂecting object
is a homogeneous sphere, the distribution of the
reﬂected radiation depends on the phase angle α
only. Thus we can express the ﬂux density ob-
served at a distance  as
F = CΦ(α) Lout
4π2 .
(7.18)
The function Φ giving the phase angle depen-
dence is called the phase function. It is nor-
malised so that Φ(α = 0◦) = 1.
Since all the radiation reﬂected from the planet
is found somewhere on the surface of the sphere,
we must have

Remembering that Lout = ALin, (7.18) can be
written in the form
F = CA

(7.25)
The ﬁrst factor is intrinsic for each object, the sec-
ond gives the phase angle dependence, the third
the distance dependence and the fourth, the inci-
dent radiation power. The ﬁrst factor is often de-
noted by
Γ = CA
4π .
(7.26)
When we substitute here the expression of C
(7.24), and solve for the Bond albedo, we get
A = 4πΓ
C
= πΓ 4
C = πΓ q = pq.
(7.27)
Here p = πΓ is called the geometric albedo
and q is the previously introduced phase integral.
These quantities are related by
A = pq.
(7.28)
The geometric albedo seems to have appeared
as an arbitrary factor with no obvious physical in-
terpretation. We’ll now try to explain this quan-
tity using a Lambertian surface. A Lambertian
surface is deﬁned as an absolutely white, diffuse
surface which reﬂects all radiation, i.e. its Bond
albedo is A = 1. Moreover, its surface bright-
ness is the same for all viewing directions, which
means that the phase function is
Φ(α) =

cosα,
if 0 ≤α ≤π/2,
0,
otherwise.
(7.29)
In reality, no such surface exists but there are
some materials which behave almost like a Lam-
bertian surface. A wall with a mat white ﬁnish is
a good approximation; although it doesn’t reﬂect
all incident light, the distribution of the reﬂected
light is about right, and its brightness looks the
same from all directions.
For a Lambertian surface the constant C is

The ratio of these ﬂux densities is

(7.32)
Now we have found a physical interpretation
for p: the geometric albedo is the ratio of the
ﬂux densities at phase angle α = 0◦reﬂected by
a planet and a Lambertian surface of the same
cross section.
The geometric albedo depends on the re-
ﬂectance of the surface but also on the phase
function Φ. Many rough surfaces reﬂect most of
the incident radiation directly backward. In such
a case the geometric albedo p is greater than in
the case of an isotropically reﬂecting surface. On
some surfaces p > 1; the most extreme case is a
mirror, for which the specular reﬂection, p = ∞.
The geometric albedo of solar system bodies vary
between 0.03–1. The geometric albedo of the
Moon is p = 0.12 and the greatest value, p = 1.0,
has been measured for the Saturnian moon Ence-
ladus.
It turns out that p can be derived from the ob-
servations, but the Bond albedo A can be deter-
mined only if the phase integral q is also known.
That will be discussed in the next section.

Photometry, Polarimetry and

Having deﬁned the phase function and albedos
we are ready to derive a formula for planetary
magnitudes. The ﬂux density of the reﬂected light
is

We now substitute the incident ﬂux

(7.36)
If we denote
V (1,0) ≡m⊙−2.5lg pR2
a2 ,
(7.37)
then the magnitude of a planet can be expressed
as
m = V (1,0) + 5lg r
a2 −2.5lgΦ(α).
(7.38)
The ﬁrst term V (1,0) depends only on the size
of the planet and its reﬂection properties. So it is
a quantity intrinsic to the planet, and it is called
the absolute magnitude (not to be confused with
the absolute magnitude in stellar astronomy!).
The second term contains the distance depen-
dence and the third one the dependence on the
phase angle.
If the phase angle is zero, and we set r =  =
a, (7.38) becomes simply m = V (1,0). The ab-
solute magnitude can be interpreted as the mag-
nitude of a body if it is at a distance of 1 au from
the Earth and the Sun at a phase angle α = 0◦.
As will be immediately noticed, this is physically
impossible because the observer would be in the
very centre of the Sun. Thus V (1,0) can never be
observed.
By using (7.37) and (7.38) at α = 0◦, the ge-
ometric albedo can be solved for in terms values
all obtainable from observations.
p =
r
aR
2
10−0.4(m0 −m⊙),
(7.39)
where m0 = m(α = 0◦). As can easily be seen,
p can be greater than unity but in the real world, it
is normally well below that. Typical values for p
are in the range 0.1–0.5.
The last term containing the phase angle de-
pendence in (7.38) is the most problematic one.
For many objects the phase function is not known
very well. This means that from the observations,
one can calculate only
V (1,α) ≡V (1,0) −2.5lgΦ(α),
(7.40)
which is the absolute magnitude at phase an-
gle α. V (1,α), plotted as a function of the phase
angle, is called the phase curve (Fig. 7.22). The
phase curve extrapolated to α = 0◦gives V (1,0).
The shape of the phase curve is very different for
objects with or without an atmosphere.
The Bond albedo can be determined only if
the phase function Φ is known. Superior planets
(and other bodies orbiting outside the orbit of the
Earth) can be observed only in a limited phase an-
gle range, and therefore Φ is poorly known, ex-
cept for those bodies that have been observed by
spacecraft. The situation is somewhat better for
the inferior planets. Especially in popular texts
the Bond albedo is given instead of p (naturally
without mentioning the exact names!). A good
excuse for this is the obvious physical meaning of
the former, and also the fact that the Bond albedo
is normalised to [0,1].
Opposition Effect
If an object has an atmo-
sphere it reﬂects light more or less isotropically
to all directions. The ﬂux density of the reﬂected
light is then proportional to the area of the visible
illuminated surface (actually to the projection of
this area on a plane perpendicular to the line of
sight). Atmosphereless bodies reﬂect light more
strongly to the direction of the incident light.
Hence the brightness increases rapidly when the
phase angle approaches zero. When the phase is
larger than about 10◦, the changes are smaller.
This rapid brightening close to the opposition is
called the opposition effect. An atmosphere de-
stroys the opposition effect.
The full explanation is still in dispute. A qual-
itative (but only partial) explanation is that close
to the opposition, no shadows are visible. When
the phase angle increases, the shadows become
visible and the brightness drops. The main rea-
son, however, is the coherent backscatter due to
the wave properties of the light.
Magnitudes of Asteroids
The shape of the
phase curve depends on the geometric albedo. It
is possible to estimate the geometric albedo if the
phase curve is known. This requires at least a few
observations at different phase angles. Most crit-
ical is the range 0◦–10◦. A known phase curve

al., Asteroid photometric and polarimetric phase effects,
in Bottke, Binzel, Cellino, Paolizhi (Eds.) Asteroids III,

can be used to determine the diameter of the
body, e.g. the size of an asteroid. Apparent di-
ameters of asteroids are so small that for ground
based observations one has to use indirect meth-
ods, like polarimetric or radiometric (thermal ra-
diation) observations (Fig. 7.22). Beginning from
the 1990’s, imaging made during spacecraft ﬂy-
bys and with the Hubble Space Telescope have
given also direct measures of the diameter and
shape of asteroids.
When the phase angle is greater than a few de-
grees, the magnitude of an asteroid depends al-
most linearly on the phase angle. Earlier this lin-
ear part was extrapolated to α = 0◦to estimate
the opposition magnitude of an asteroid. Due to
the opposition effect the actual opposition mag-
nitude can be considerably brighter.
In 1985 the IAU adopted the HG system for
magnitudes of atmosphereless bodies. Formally,
it was semi-empirical, although it was based on
photometric theories by Lumme and Bowell. In
the 2012 meeting this was replaced by a new
HG1G2 system. Although the older HG system
was useful in many cases, it was not satisfac-
tory if the opposition effect was very small or re-
stricted to very small phase angles.

Fitting an expression in terms of the basis
functions to the observed phase curve one gets
the coefﬁcients ai, and then further
H = −2.5lg(a1 + a2 + a3),
G1 = a1/(a1 + a2 + a3),
G2 = a2/(a1 + a2 + a3),
(7.42)
When the phase angle is zero, we have
V (1,0) = H −2.5lg[G1 + G2 + 1 −G1 −G2]
= H,
(7.43)
and hence H is just the absolute magnitude in op-
position. The constants G1 and G2 describe the
shape of the phase curve.

Polarimetric Observations
The light reﬂected
by the bodies of the solar system is usually po-
larised, at least to some degree. The amount of
polarisation depends on the reﬂecting material
and also on the geometry: polarisation is a func-
tion of the phase angle. The degree of polarisa-
tion P is deﬁned as
P = F⊥−F∥
F⊥+ F∥
,
(7.44)
where F⊥is the ﬂux density of radiation, per-
pendicular to a ﬁxed plane, called the scattering
plane, and F∥is the ﬂux density parallel to the
plane. In solar system studies, polarisation is usu-
ally referred to the plane deﬁned by the Earth, the
Sun, and the object. According to (7.44), P can
be positive or negative; thus the terms “positive”
and “negative” polarisation are used.
The degree of polarisation as a function of the
phase angle depends on the surface structure and
the atmosphere. The degree of polarisation of the
light reﬂected by the surface of an atmosphereless
body is positive when the phase angle is greater
than about 20◦. Closer to opposition, polarisa-
tion is negative. A dependence between the polar-
isation and geometric albedo has been observed.
This gives an independent method for determin-
ing the albedo and the size.
When light is reﬂected from an atmosphere,
the degree of polarisation as a function of the
phase angle is more complicated. For some phase
angles P can be highly negative. Using the theory
of radiative transfer, one can compute how the at-
mosphere affects light and its polarisation. Com-
paring these results with observations one can ob-
tain information about the contents of the atmo-
sphere. For example, the composition of Venus’
atmosphere could be studied by polarisation stud-
ies before any probes were sent to the planet.

Planetary Spectroscopy
The photometric and
polarimetric observations discussed above were
monochromatic. However, the studies of the at-
mosphere of Venus also used spectral informa-
tion. Broadband UBV photometry or polarime-
try is the simplest example of spectrophotometry
(spectropolarimetry). The term spectrophotome-
try usually means observations made with sev-
eral narrowband ﬁlters. Naturally, solar system
objects are also observed by means of “classical”
spectroscopy.
Spectrophotometry and polarimetry give in-
formation at discrete wavelengths only. In prac-
tise, the number of points of the spectrum (or
the number of ﬁlters available) is often limited
to 20–30. This means that no details can be seen
in the spectra. On the other hand, in ordinary
spectroscopy, the limiting magnitude is smaller,
although the situation is rapidly improving with
the new generation detectors, such as the CCD
camera.
The spectrum observed is the spectrum of the
Sun. Generally, the planetary contribution is rel-
atively small, and these differences can be seen
when the solar spectrum is subtracted. The Ura-
nian spectrum is a typical example (Fig. 7.23).
There are strong absorption bands in the near-
infrared. Laboratory measurements have shown
that these are due to methane. A portion of the
red light is also absorbed, causing the greenish
colour of the planet. The general techniques of
spectral observations are discussed in the context
of stellar spectroscopy in Chap. 9.
7.10
Thermal Radiation of the
Planets
Thermal radiation of the solar system bodies de-
pends on the albedo and the distance from the
Sun, i.e. on the amount of absorbed radiation. In-
ternal heat is important in Jupiter and Saturn, but
we may neglect it at this point.
By using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ﬂux
on the surface of the Sun can be expressed as
L = 4πR2
⊙σT 4
⊙.

7.11
Origin of the Solar System
167
If the Bond albedo of the body is A, the fraction
of the radiation absorbed by the planet is (1 −
A). This is later emitted as heat. If the body is at
a distance r from the Sun, the absorbed ﬂux is
Labs = R2
⊙σT 4
⊙πR2
r2
(1 −A).
(7.45)
There are good reasons to assume that the body
is in thermal equilibrium, i.e. the emitted and
the absorbed ﬂuxes are equal. If not, the body
will warm up or cool down until equilibrium is
reached.
Let us ﬁrst assume that the body is rotating
slowly. The dark side has had time to cool down,
and the thermal radiation is emitted mainly from
one hemisphere. The ﬂux emitted is
Lem = 2πR2σT 4,
(7.46)
where T is the temperature of the body and 2πR2
is the area of one hemisphere. In thermal equilib-
rium, (7.48) and (7.49) are equal:

(1 −A) = 2T 4,
whence

(7.47)
A body rotating quickly emits an approximately
equal ﬂux from all parts of its surface. The emit-
ted ﬂux is then

and the temperature

The theoretical temperatures obtained above
are not valid for most of the major planets. The
main “culprits” responsible here are the atmo-
sphere and the internal heat. Measured and the-
oretical temperatures of some major planets are
compared in Table 7.3. Venus is an extreme ex-
ample of the disagreement between theoretical
and actual ﬁgures. The reason is the greenhouse

effect: radiation is allowed to enter, but not to exit.
The same effect is at work in the Earth’s atmo-
sphere. Without the greenhouse effect, the mean
temperature could be well below the freezing
point and the whole Earth would be ice-covered.
Particularly strong the effect is on Venus, where
the surface temperature is hundreds of degrees
higher than the theoretical value.
According to the Wien displacement law
(5.22) λmax = b/T the radiation maximum of
a body at 200 K is at λ = 14 µm, deep in in-
frared. When the thermal radiation in the infrared
or radio range is measured the temperature can be
found, and further the Bond albedo can be calcu-
lated from (7.47) or (7.48). If also the phase func-
tion is known the geometric albedo and hence the
diameter can be evaluated.
7.11
Origin of the Solar System
Cosmogony is a branch of astronomy which stud-
ies the origin of the solar system. The ﬁrst steps
of the planetary formation processes are closely
connected to star formation.
Although the properties and details of the bod-
ies of our solar system (see next chapter) may
look wildly different there are some distinct fea-
tures which have to be explained by any serious
cosmogonical theory. These include:
– planetary orbits are almost coplanar and also
parallel to the solar equator;
– orbits are almost circular;
– planets orbit the Sun counterclockwise, which
is also the direction of solar rotation;

– planets also rotate around their axes counter-
clockwise (excluding Venus and Uranus);
– planets have 99 % of the angular momentum
of the solar system but only 0.15 % of the total
mass;
– terrestrial and giant planets exhibit physical
and chemical differences;
– relative abundances of ices and rocks as a func-
tion of the distance from the Sun.
Sometimes also the empirical Titius-Bode law
is included (Table 7.4). It states that
a = 0.4 + 0.3 × 2n,
n = −∞,0,1,2,...
(7.49)
where the semimajor axis a is expressed in au.
It is sometimes mentioned that the ﬁrst scien-
tiﬁc theory was the vortex theory by the French
philosopher René Descartes in 1644; however it
was concerned about the motion of the solar sys-
tem bodies and not its origin.
The ﬁrst modern cosmogonical theories were
introduced in the 18th century. One of the ﬁrst
cosmogonists was Immanuel Kant, who in 1755
presented his nebular hypothesis. According to
this theory, the solar system condensed from
a large rotating nebula. Kant’s nebular hypoth-
esis is surprisingly close to the basic ideas of
modern cosmogonical models. In a similar vein,
Pierre Simon de Laplace suggested in 1796 that
the planets have formed from gas rings ejected
from the equator of the collapsing Sun.
The main difﬁculty of the nebular hypothesis
was its inability to explain the distribution of an-
gular momentum in the solar system. Although
the planets represent less than 1 % of the total
mass, they possess 98 % of the angular momen-
tum. There appeared to be no way of achieving
such an unequal distribution. A second objection
to the nebular hypothesis was that it provided no
mechanism to form planets from the postulated
gas rings.
Already in 1745, Georges Louis Leclerc de
Buffon had proposed that the planets were formed
from a vast outﬂow of solar material, ejected
upon the impact of a large comet. Various catas-
trophe theories were popular in the 19th century
and in the ﬁrst decades of the 20th century when
the cometary impact was replaced by a close en-
counter with another star. The theory was devel-
oped, e.g. by Forest R. Moulton (1905) and James
Jeans (1917).
Strong tidal forces during the closest approach
would tear some gas out of the Sun; this mate-
rial would later accrete into planets. Such a close
encounter would be an extremely rare event. As-
suming a typical star density of 0.15 stars per
cubic parsec and an average relative velocity of
20 km/s, only a few encounters would have taken
place in the whole Galaxy during the last 5109
years. The solar system could be a unique speci-
men. This is clearly against modern observations
(Chap. 22).
The main objection to the collision theory is
that most of the hot material torn off the Sun
would be thrown out to space, rather than remain-
ing in orbit around the Sun. There also was no
obvious way how the material could form a plan-
etary system.
In the face of the dynamical and statistical dif-
ﬁculties of the collision theory, the nebular hy-
pothesis was revised and modiﬁed in the 1940’s.
In particular, it became clear that magnetic forces
and gas outﬂow could efﬁciently transfer angular
momentum from the Sun to the planetary nebula.
The main principles of planetary formation are
now thought to be reasonably well understood.
The oldest rocks found on the Earth are about
3.7 × 109 years old; some lunar and meteorite

samples are somewhat older. When all the facts
are put together, it can be estimated that the Earth
and other planets were formed about 4.56 × 109
years ago. On the other hand, the age of the
Galaxy is at least twice as high, so the overall
conditions have not changed signiﬁcantly during
the lifetime of the solar system. Moreover, there
is even direct evidence nowadays, such as other
planetary systems and protoplanetary disks, pro-
plyds (Fig. 7.24).
The Sun and practically the whole solar sys-
tem simultaneously condensed from a rotating
collapsing cloud of dust and gas, the density of
which was some 10,000 atoms or molecules per
cm3 and the temperature 10–50 K. The elements
heavier than helium were formed in the interiors
of stars of preceding generations, as will be ex-
plained in Sect. 12.8. The collapse of the cloud
was initiated perhaps by a shock wave emanating
from a nearby supernova explosion.
The original mass of the cloud must be thou-
sands of Solar masses to exceed the Jeans mass.
When the cloud contracts the Jeans mass de-
creases. Cloud fragments and each fragment con-
tract independently as explained in later chapters
of star formation. One of the fragments became
the Sun.
When the fragment continued its collapse, par-
ticles inside the cloud collided with each other.
Rotation of the cloud allowed the particles to sink
toward the same plane, perpendicular to the rota-
tion axis of the cloud, but prevented them from
moving toward the axis. This explains why the
planetary orbits are in the same plane.
The mass of the proto-Sun was larger than
the mass of the modern Sun. The ﬂat disk in the
plane of the ecliptic contained perhaps 1/10 of
the total mass. Moreover, far outside, the rem-
nants of the outer edges of the original cloud were
still moving toward the centre. The Sun was los-
ing its angular momentum to the surrounding gas
by means of the magnetic ﬁeld. When nuclear
reactions were ignited, a strong solar wind car-
ried away more angular momentum from the Sun.

170
7
The Solar System
The ﬁnal result was the modern, slowly rotating
Sun.
Gravitational and viscous torques transferred
the angular momentum outwards. The former
means a density wave caused by the instability of
the disk, transferring bot mass and angular mo-
mentum outwards. Collisions between dust parti-
cles increased the velocities of outer particles and
slowed down inner particles. Thus most particles
moved inwards but the angular momentum out-
wards and the disk spread out.
Later, when nuclear reactions started, the
strong solar wind transferred more angular mo-
mentum. At this T Tauri stage the protosun lost
mass as much as 10−8 M⊙/a in the form of solar
wind.
Collisions of the disk particles continued. Ini-
tially individual particles stick together because
of the weak intermolecular van der Waals forces.
In less than 10,000 years the particle size in-
creased from a few micrometres to millimetres.
The growth rate was then proportional to the
cross sections of the particles.
When the particles became bigger the growth
rate increased considerably and became propor-
tional to the fourth power of the particle radius.
The reason for this was that the weak gravitation
of bigger particles started attract gas and dust. If
the mass of a particle is M and radius R and the
relative velocity of a dust particle V0 (Fig. 7.25)
the effective cross section of collisions to the big-
ger particle is s2:
s2 =

R2 + 2GMR
V 2
0

.
(7.50)
Since M ∝R3 we have s2 ∝R4.
The velocity of the gas was about 0.5 %
smaller than the orbital velocity, and thus parti-
cles moved faster than gas and swept away the
gas and dust. This resulted in rapidly growing
planetesimals, with diameters from a few metres
to kilometres.
Since big particles were moving faster than
the gas they experienced a small friction slow-
ing their velocity. The effect was strongest on me-
tre size particles. Thus small planetesimals had to
grow bigger in a few thousand years or drift down
to the Sun.
Fig. 7.25 If a particle
passes a massive object at a
close distance it will hit the
larger body and increase its
mass
When the planetesimals collided (Fig. 7.26)
they grew bigger but the growth rate was no more
proportional to the fourth power of the radius but
slower. When the planetesimals reached the size
of planets their mutual gravitation became in-
creasingly important. Collisions of planetesimals
and protoplanets shaped the solar system until it
to some extent looked like the current system.
The formation of the Moon, the slow retrograde
of Venus and the abnormal orientation of the ro-
tation axis of Uranus were caused by collisions of
objects of the size of Mars.
The formation of Jupiter and Saturn took
about 103–106 years, terrestrial planets 106–107
years, Uranus and Neptune 107–108 years. The
Nice model (Sect. 7.12) suggests that originally
Neptune was closer to the Sun than Uranus.
Resonances caused Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
to drift farther from the Sun, whence Neptune
moved outside Uranus. Jupiter, on the other hand,
moved closer to the Sun.
The strong perturbations by Jupiter prevented
the formation of a large planet between Mars and
Jupiter. The objects in this asteroid belt are either
planetesimals or shattered protoplanets.
Depending on the volatility the matter of the
solar system can be divided roughly into three
categories: Gases, mainly hydrogen and helium,
consisting of about 98.2 % of the total mass of

The Solar System
Fig. 7.27 Temperature distribution in the solar system
during planet formation. The present chemical composi-
tion of the planets reﬂects this temperature distribution.
The approximate condensing temperatures of some com-
pounds have been indicated
the solar system and remaining gaseous until very
close to the absolute zero. Ices, about 1.4 %, melt-
ing around 160 K at the pressure of the initial
nebula. Rocks, about 0.4 %, melting over temper-
atures exceeding 1000 K (Fig. 7.27).
Planets from Mercury to Mars consist mainly
of rocks. When they were born the temperature
in that region was too high for gases and ices
to remain bound to planets. In this region over
99 % of the matter remained outside the plan-
ets. The temperature distribution is seen in the
chemical contents of the planets. At the distance
of Mercury the temperature had decreased below
1400 K, which meant that compounds of iron and
nickel could condense from the nebula. In fact,
they form about 60 % of the mass of Mercury.
When we move outwards other elements become
more abundant. At the distance of the Earth the
temperature is about 600 K and near Mars only
450 K. The mantle of the Earth contains about
10 % of iron(II)oxide FeO. In Mars there is con-
siderably more FeO, but in Mercury hardly any-
thing at all.
Table 7.5 gives the mass distribution of the
solar system and Table 7.6 the minimum mass
needed for the existing planets. This takes into ac-
count the different composition of the planets and
the Sun. In reality, the mass of the accretion disk
must be much bigger, since not all of the mass did
not end up in planets.
Using the minimum mass we can also calcu-
late the required density distribution of the ac-

The density proﬁle of the disk seems to obey
a r−2 law pretty well except in the asteroid belt,
where these is a clear mass defect (Fig. 7.28).
At the distance of Jupiter and Saturn the tem-
perature was already so low that icy bodies could
form. Some satellites of Saturn are examples of
such bodies. From the surrounding cloud the gi-
ant planets collected gas that could stay around
the planets because they were relatively far from
the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn contain mostly hy-
drogen and helium. In Uranus and Neptune the
content of these gases is smaller, possibly around
twenty percent.
Continuous collisions of meteoroids, shrink-
ing of the planets under their own gravity, and
radioactive decay of relatively short lived nu-
clei produced a lot of heat. Heating caused par-
tial melting of planets, leading to differentiation:
heavier elements sank down and lighter ones rose
towards the surface.
The bombardment continued for about half a
billion years. Its effects are still seen on most
solid bodies. For instance, the Lunar maria are
remnants of that era. On the Earth the tectonic
resurfacing and erosion have destroyed most me-
teorite craters.

the asteroid belt there
seems to be a mass deﬁcit,
indicating that a
considerable amount of
matter has been removed
elsewhere. The vertical
lines separate regions from
which each planet has
accreted its material
Due to the perturbations by large planets the
“leftover” planetesimals collided to planets or
were thrown out to the outskirts of the solar sys-
tem or even out to the interstellar space. What re-
mained where mainly the asteroids currently on
stable orbits. Lots of low-density objects, comets,
were thrown to the outer regions of the solar sys-
tem. These form the current Oort cloud. The total
mass of the Oort cloud may be even 40 M⊕and
it may contain billions of comets.
Also the small bodies beyond the orbit of Nep-
tune and the somewhat more distant Kuiper belt
may have originated nearer to the Sun.
Planetary formation ended when the nuclear
reactions of the Sun started and the Sun entered
its T Tauri stage (Sect. 14.3). The strong solar
wind caused the Sun to lose mass and angular
momentum. The mass loss was about 10−6 M⊙
a year, yet altogether maybe less than 0.1 M⊙.
The solar wind blew away the gas dust still in the
interplanetary space, and thus the planets could
not accrete any more matter.
The solar wind or radiation pressure has no
effect on millimetre- and centimetre-sized parti-
cles. However, they will drift into the Sun because
of the Poynting–Robertson effect, ﬁrst introduced
by John P. Poynting in 1903. Later H.P. Robertson
derived the effect by using the theory of relativity.
When a small body absorbs and emits radiation, it
loses its orbital angular momentum and the body
spirals to the Sun. At the distance of the asteroid
belt, this process takes only a million years or so.
Therefore the meteors wee see nowadays must be
much younger than the solar system. A relatively
big fraction of them is material disrupted from
comets.

Nice Models
It has been assumed that the distances of the plan-
ets have not changed much since they were born.
The most essential feature of the Nice model is
that the giant planets were born much closer to
the Sun. The model is based on a large number
of computer simulations, carried out in the Côte
d’Azur observatory near Nice.
The planets drifted to their current orbits due
to their mutual gravity and resonances. At the
same time planetary perturbations made the left-
over material either to collide with planets or
move outwards to the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt
and Oort cloud.
The original Nice model could not properly
explain all properties of the solar system, like the
structure of the Kuiper belt. These problems were
ﬁxed in the newer Nice model 2.
There are several versions of the models with
varying details. They seem to approach the cor-
rect explanation, it may still be too early to dis-
cuss here their rather complicated details before
they have been conﬁrmed more convincingly.

The gradient of the potential V (A) gives
a force vector per mass unit. The ﬁrst term of
(3) vanishes, and the second term is a constant
and independent of r. It represents the central
motion. The third term of the force vector, how-
ever, depends on r. It is the main term of the
tidal force. As one can see, it depends inversely
on the third power of the distance d. The tidal
forces are diminished very rapidly when the
distance of a body increases. Therefore the tidal
force caused by the Sun is less than half of that
of the Moon in spite of much greater mass of
the Sun.

is called Doodson’s tidal constant. It’s value

zenith angle of the body. The zenith angle z can
be expressed in terms of the hour angle h and

the observer

Equation (5) is the traditional basic equation of
the tidal potential, the Laplace’s tidal equation.
In (5) one can directly see several charac-
teristics of tides. The term S causes the semi-
diurnal tide because it depends on cos2h. It has
two daily maxima and minima, separated by 12
hours, exactly as one can obtain in following
the ebb and ﬂood. It reaches its maximum at
the equator and is zero at the poles (cos2 φ).
The term T expresses the diurnal tides
(cosh). It has its maximum at the latitude ±45◦
and is zero at the equator and at the poles
(sin2φ). The third term Z is independent of the
rotation of the Earth. It causes the long period
tides, the period of which is half the orbital pe-
riod of the body (about 14 days in the case of
the Moon and 6 months for the Sun). It is zero
at the latitude ±35.27◦and has its maximum
at the poles. Moreover, the time average of Z
is non-zero, causing a permanent deformation
of the Earth. This is called the permanent tide.
It slightly increases the ﬂattening of the Earth
and it is inseparable from the ﬂattening due to
the rotation.
The total value of the tidal potential can be
computed simply adding the potentials caused
by the Moon and the Sun. Due to the tidal
forces, the whole body of the Earth is de-
formed. The vertical motion r of the crust can
be computed from
r = hV2
g ≈0.06V2 [m],
(6)
where g is the mean free fall acceleration, g ≈
9.81 ms−2 and h is a dimensionless number,
the Love number, h ≈0.6, which describes the
elasticity of the Earth. In the picture below,
one can see the vertical motion of the crust in
Helsinki, Finland (φ = 60◦,λ = 25◦) in Jan-
uary 1995. The non-zero value of the temporal
mean can already be seen in this picture.
The tides have other consequences, too. Be-
cause the Earth rotates faster than the Moon or-
bits the Earth, the tidal bulge does not lie on
the Moon–Earth line but is slightly ahead (in
the direction of Earth’s rotation), see below.
Due to the drag, the rotation of the Earth
slows down by about 1–2 ms per century. The
same reason has caused the Moon’s period
of rotation to slow down to its orbital period
and the Moon faces the same side towards the
Earth. The misaligned bulge pulls the Moon
forward. The acceleration causes the increase
in the semimajor axis of the Moon, about 3 cm
per year.

Example 7.2 (Solar Energy Flux on the Earth)
Calculate the diurnal solar energy ﬂux per unit
area at the distance of the Earth.
The solar ﬂux density outside the Earth’s at-
mosphere (the solar constant) is S0 = 1370 W/m2.
Consider a situation at latitude φ, when the solar
declination is δ. If the atmospheric extinction is
neglected, the ﬂux density on the surface is
S = S0 sina,
where a is the elevation of the Sun. We can write
sina as a function of latitude, declination, and
hour angle h:
sina = sinδ sinφ + cosδ cosφ cosh.
On a cloudless day, the energy is received be-
tween sunrise and sunset. The corresponding
hour angles can be obtained from the equation
above, when a = 0:
cosh0 = −tanδ tanφ.
In the course of one day, the energy received on
a unit area is
W =
 h0
−h0
S dt.
The hour angle h is expressed in radians, so the
time t is
t = h
2π P,
where P = 1 d = 24 h. The total energy is thus
W =
 h0
−h0
S0(sinδ sinφ + cosδ cosφ cosh)
× P
2π dh
= S0P
π (h0 sinδ sinφ + cosδ cosφ sinh0),
where
h0 = arccos(−tanδ tanφ).
For example near the equator (φ = 0◦) cosh0 = 0
and
W(φ = 0◦) = S0P
π
cosδ.
At those latitudes where the Sun will not set, h0 =
π and
Wcirc = S0P sinδ sinφ.
Near the poles, the Sun is always circumpolar
when above the horizon, and so
W(φ = 90◦) = S0P sinδ.
Interestingly enough, during the summer when
the declination of the Sun is large, the polar ar-
eas receive more energy than the areas close to
the equator. This is true when
W(φ = 90◦) > W(φ = 0◦)
⇔
S0P sinδ > S0P cosδ/π
⇔
tanδ > 1/π
⇔
δ > 17.7◦.
The declination of the Sun is greater than this
about two months every summer.
However, atmospheric extinction diminishes
these values, and the loss is at its greatest at the
poles, where the elevation of the Sun is always
relatively small. Radiation must penetrate thick
layers of the atmosphere and the path length is
comparable to 1/sina. If it is assumed that the
fraction k of the ﬂux density reaches the surface
when the Sun is at zenith, the ﬂux density when
the Sun is at the elevation a is
S′ = S0 sina k1/sina.

7.13
Examples

The total energy received during one day is thus
W =
 h0
−h0
S′ dt =
 h0

S0 sina k1/sina dt.
This cannot be solved in a closed form and nu-
merical methods must be used.
The ﬁgure on next page shows the daily re-
ceived energy W [kW h/m2] during a year at lat-
itudes φ = 0◦, 60◦, and 90◦without extinction,
and when k = 0.8, which is close to the real value.
Example 7.3 (Magnitude of a Planet)
The ap-
parent magnitude of Mars during the 1975 op-
position was m1 = −1.6 and the distance to the
Sun, r1 = 1.55 au. During the 1982 opposition,
the distance was r2 = 1.64 au. Calculate the ap-
parent magnitude in the 1982 opposition.
At opposition, the distance of Mars from the
Earth is  = r −1. The observed ﬂux density de-
pends on the distances to the Earth and the Sun,
F ∝
1
r22 .
Using the magnitude formula (4.9) we obtain
m1 −m2 = −2.5lg r2
2(r2 −1)2
r2
1(r1 −1)2
⇒
m2 = m1 + 5lg r2(r2 −1)
r1(r1 −1)

1.55 × 0.55 ≈−1.1.
The same result is obtained if (7.38) is separately
written for both oppositions.
Example 7.4 (The Brightness of Venus)
Find
the instant when Venus is brightest if the bright-
ness is proportional to the projected size of the
illuminated surface. The orbits are assumed to be
circular.
The size of the illuminated surface is the area
of the semicircle ACE± half the area of the el-
lipse ABCD. The semiaxes of the ellipse are
R and R cosα. If the radius of the planet is R,
the illuminated area is
π R2
2 + 1
2πR × R cosα = π
2 R2(1 + cosα),
where α is the phase angle. The ﬂux density is
inversely proportional to the square of the dis-
tance . Thus
F ∝1 + cosα
2
.
The cosine formula yields
M2
⊕= r2 + 2 −2r cosα.
When cosα is solved and inserted in the ﬂux den-
sity we obtain
F ∝2r + r2 + 2 −M2

The minimum of the equation yields the distance
where Venus is brightest:

is α = 118◦.

What is the apparent magnitude at phase angles
0◦and 1◦?
Values of the basis functions are Φ1(1◦) =
0.9667, Φ2(1◦) = 0.9900, Φ3(1◦) = 0.577. Us-
ing these we get the absolute magnitude at the
phase angle 1◦:

(7.52)
Near the opposition we can approximate  =
r −1 = 1.42 au. The apparent magnitude at the
opposition is then
m = 6.929 + 5lg(1.42 × 2.42) −2.5lgΦ(0◦)
= 6.929 + 5lg3.36 = 9.561.
(7.53)
When the phase angle is 1◦the absolute magni-
tude is 0.147 greater than at the opposition. The
apparent magnitudes differ by the same amount;
hence m(α = 1◦) = 9.71.

Objects of the Solar System
Our solar system contains eights planets orbit-
ing the Sun, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets and
meteors, as well satellites orbiting planets and
smaller ring particles. In this chapter the proper-
ties of these different object are discussed.
8.1
Mercury
Mercury is the innermost planet of the solar sys-
tem. Its diameter is 4800 km. Mercury is always
found in the vicinity of the Sun; its maximum
elongation is only 28◦. Observations are difﬁ-
cult because Mercury is always seen in a bright
sky and close to the horizon. Mercury has phases
like the Moon. When it is closest to the Earth
in the inferior conjunction, the dark side of the
planet is toward us. And when the whole illumi-
nated hemisphere is towards the Earth Mercury
is behind the Sun and farthest from us. A couple
of times in a century Mercury transits the solar
disk (Sect. 7.5). Observations during transits have
shown that Mercury does not have an appreciable
atmosphere.
The ﬁrst maps of Mercury were drawn at the
end of the 19th century but the reality of the de-
tails was not conﬁrmed. As late as in the begin-
ning of the 1960’s, it was believed that Mercury
always turns the same side toward the Sun. How-
ever, measurements of the thermal radio emission
showed that the temperature of the night side is
too high, about 100 K, instead of almost absolute
zero. Finally, the rotation period was established
by radar.
Fig. 8.1 Length of day in Mercury. The positions of Mer-
cury during the ﬁrst revolution are shown outside the el-
lipse. Upon returning to the aphelion, the planet has turned
540◦(1 1
2 revolutions). After two full cycles the planet has
rotated three times around its axis and the same side points
toward the Sun. The length of the day is 176 d, longer than
on any other planet
One revolution around the Sun takes 88 days.
The rotation period is two-thirds of this, 59 days.
This means that every second time the planet is
in, say, perihelion, the same hemisphere faces the
Sun (Fig. 8.1). This kind of spin–orbit coupling
can result from tidal forces exerted by a central
body on an object moving in a fairly eccentric or-
bit.
Re-examination of old observations revealed
why Mercury had been presumed to rotate syn-
chronously. Owing to its geometry, Mercury is

pears to be a fault produced by compression of the crust.

easiest to observe in spring and autumn. In six
months, Mercury orbits twice around the Sun, ro-
tating exactly three times around its own axis.
Consequently, during observations, the same side
was always facing the Sun! The details visible on
the surface are very obscure and the few excep-
tional observations were interpreted as observa-
tional errors.
Since the rotation period of Mercury is τ⋆=
58.6 d ans the orbital period P = 87.97 d, (2.43)
shows that the length of day is τ = 176 d, or two
Mercury’s years. The rotation axis is almost per-
pendicular to the orbital plane.
The mean distance from the Sun is 0.39 au.
The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.21, which means
that the distance varies between 0.31 and 0.47 au.
Because of the high eccentricity, the surface tem-
perature of the subsolar point varies substantially:
at the perihelion, the temperature is about 700 K;
at the aphelion, it is 100 K lower. Temperature
variations on Mercury are the most extreme in the
solar system because in the night side the temper-
ature drops below 100 K.
The precession of the perihelion of Mercury
is more than 0.15◦per century. When the New-
tonian perturbations are subtracted, there remains
an excess of 43′′. This is fully explained by the
general theory of relativity. The explanation of
the perihelion precession was one of the ﬁrst tests
of the general theory of relativity.

Objects of the Solar System
The ﬁrst spacecraft studying Mercury was the
US Mariner 10 that passed Mercury three times
in 1974 and 1975. The orbital period of Mariner
10 around the Sun was exactly twice the period
of Mercury. The two-thirds-factor meant that the
same side of the planet was illuminated during
every ﬂy-by! The other side remained unknown.
It was only in 2004 that the Messenger (MErcury
Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and
Ranging) mapped the whole surface of Mercury,
ﬁrst on three ﬂy-bys in 2008–2009 and from an
orbit around Mercury in 2011–2015. The next
probe will be the BepiColombo built by the Eu-
ropean Space Agency ESA. The launch is sched-
uled for 2017, and after several ﬂy-bys it should
settle on an orbit around Mercury in 2024.
Since Mercury has no satellites, precise values
of its mass and density could be calculated only
after Mariner’s ﬂight.
The Mariner 10 data revealed a moon-like
landscape. Mercury’s surface is covered by im-
pact craters (Fig. 8.2), indicating that the surface
is old and undisturbed by continental drift or vol-
canic eruptions. There are some signs of volcanic
activity, but they are very old, possibly over a bil-
lion years.
There are also some circular formations re-
sembling lunar maria, formed by impacts of
larger object and ﬁlled by lava seeping from the
interior of the planet. The largest circular area is
the 1500 km wide Caloris Basin. The shock wave
produced by the Caloris impact was focused to
the antipodal point, breaking the crust into com-
plex blocks in a large area, the diameter of which
is hundreds of kilometers. This region is named
the Weird Terrain.
There are also faults that were possibly pro-
duced by compression of the crust. The volume
change probably was due to the cooling of the
planet.
Mercury’s relatively small size and proxim-
ity to the Sun, resulting in low gravity and high
temperature, are the reasons for its lack of atmo-
sphere. There is a layer made up of atoms blasted
off the surface by the solar wind. The tenuous “at-
mosphere” is composed mainly of oxygen, nitro-
gen, and helium. The atoms quickly escape into
space and are constantly replenished.
Due to the absence of an atmosphere, the tem-
perature on Mercury drops very rapidly after sun-
set. The rotational axis is almost perpendicular
to the orbital plane; therefore it is possible that,
close to the poles, there are areas where the tem-
perature is permanently below the freezing point.
Radar echos from the surface of Mercury show
several anomalously reﬂective and highly depo-
larised features at the north and south poles.
Some of these areas can be addressed to the
craters, the bottoms of which are permanently in
shadow. One candidate of the radar-bright fea-
tures is water ice that has survived in the perma-
nent shadow.
Existence of ice was conﬁrmed by the Mes-
senger probe. At the bottoms of some craters the
temperature never exceeds 100 K. The ice is cov-
ered by regolith that prevents the ice from subli-
mating and evaporating to space. It has been esti-
mated that the total amount of ice could be even
1/1000 of the ice in the Antarctic.
It has been said that Mercury looks like the
Moon from the outside but is terrestrial from the
inside. According to theoretical models, the in-
ternal structure is similar to that of the Earth but
the core is substantially larger. The density of the
planet is about the same as that of the Earth, in-
dicating that the size of the Fe–Ni core is roughly
about 75 % of the planet’s radius. The thickness
of the mantle is only 500–700 km and that of the
crust 100–300 km.
Due to the vicinity of the Sun, the temperature
of the primeval nebula at the distance of Mercury
was quite high during planetary formation. Thus
the relative abundances of the volatile elements
are smaller than on any other terrestrial planet.
The Sun creates strong tides on Mercury, with
main periods of 44 and 88 days. Measuring the
tidal variation is difﬁcult due to its slowness, but
it has bee calculated that the vertical motion near
the equator could be a couple of meters. (The
crust of the Earth moves about 30 cm due to the
lunar tides.)
Mercury has a weak magnetic ﬁeld, about 1 %
as strong as that of the Earth. The presence of
the magnetic ﬁeld is unexpected because Mer-
cury is much smaller than the Earth and it rotates
slowly. According to the dynamo theory, a mag-

size of Venus changes with phase. The planet is far behind the Sun when the illuminated side faces the Earth
netic ﬁeld is generated by ﬂows in a liquid, elec-
trically conducting core. The magnetic ﬁeld can-
not be a remnant from ancient times, since the
internal temperature of the planet must have ex-
ceeded the critical Curie point. Therefore, it must
be assumed that a part of the core is molten.
Possibly the deformations caused by tides and
the friction releasing heat keep the core molten
and maintain mass ﬂows generating the magnetic
ﬁeld.
8.2
Venus
Venus is the brightest object in the sky, after the
Sun and the Moon. Like Mercury, Venus can be
seen only in the morning or in the evening sky.
Sometimes it is possible to see Venus even if the
Sun is above the horizon, if its exact position
is known. In antiquity, Venus was thought to be
two different planets, Hesperos and Phosphorus,
evening star and morning star.
The maximum elongation of Venus is about
47◦. Venus is a remarkable object when shining
in the dark sky at its brightest, 35 days before or
after the inferior conjunction, when one-third of
the surface is seen lit (Fig. 8.3).
At the inferior conjunction, the Earth–Venus
distance is only 42 million km. The diameter
of Venus is about 12,000 km, which means that
the apparent diameter can be as large as one arc
minute. Under favourable conditions it is even
possible to see the shape of the crescent Venus
with binoculars. At the superior conjunction, the
apparent diameter is only 10 arc seconds.
Venus is covered by clouds. Its surface is
nowhere visible; only featureless yellowish cloud
tops can be seen (Fig. 8.4). Therefore, even the
rotation period was long unknown.
The chemical composition of the Venusian
atmosphere was known prior to the space age.
Spectroscopic observations revealed CO2, but no
oxygen. About 98 % of the atmosphere is car-
bon dioxide. Some clues about the cloud compo-
sition were obtained from polarimetric observa-
tions. The famous French planetary astronomer
Bernard Lyot made polarimetric observations in
the 1920’s, but not until decades later was it re-
alised that his observations could be explained by
assuming that light was scattered by liquid spher-
ical particles whose index of refraction is 1.44.
This is signiﬁcantly higher than the index of re-
fraction of water, 1.33. Moreover, water is not
liquid at that temperature. A good candidate was
sulphuric acid H2SO4. Later, spacecraft con-
ﬁrmed this interpretation.
In 1962, radar measurements revealed that the
rotation period is 243 days in a retrograde direc-
tion, i.e. opposite to the rotation of other planets.
The axis of rotation is almost perpendicular to the
orbital plane; the inclination is 177◦. The reason
for the strange rotation is not known.
The temperature at the cloud tops is about
250 K. Because the Bond albedo is as high
as 75 %, the surface temperature was believed
to be moderate, even suitable for life. Opinions
changed dramatically when thermal radio emis-
sion was measured at the end of the 1950’s. This
emission originates on the surface of the planet
and can penetrate the clouds. The surface tem-
perature turned out to be 750 K, well above the
melting point of lead. The reason for this is the
greenhouse effect. The outgoing infrared radia-
tion is blocked by atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The pressure of the atmosphere at the surface is
90 atm.

Mariner 2 (1962) was the ﬁrst spacecraft to
encounter the planet. Five years later, the Soviet
Venera 4 sent the ﬁrst data from below the clouds,
and the ﬁrst pictures of the surface were sent by
Venera 9 and 10 in 1975. The ﬁrst radar map was
completed in 1980, after 18 months of mapping
by the US Pioneer Venus 1. The best and the
most complete maps (about 98 % of the planet’s
surface) were made using the synthetic aperture
radar observations of the Magellan spacecraft in
1990–1994. The resolution of the maps is as high
as 100 m and the elevation was measured with
a resolution of 30 metres. The Venus Express
launched by ESA studied Venus from an orbit
during 2006–2014.
Radar mappings revealed canyons, mountains,
craters, volcanoes and other volcanic formations
(Fig. 8.5). The surface of Venus is covered by
about 20 % of lowland plains, 70 % of gently
rolling uplands and lava ﬂows, and 10 % of high-
lands.
There are only few major highland areas.
The largest continent, Aphrodite Terra, is close
to the equator of Venus; its size is similar to
South America. Another large continent at the
latitude 70°N is called Ishtar Terra, where the
highest mountain on Venus, the 12 km high
Maxwell Montes is situated. (IAU has decided
that the Venusian nomenclature has to be femi-
nine. Maxwell Montes, after the famous physicist
James Clerk Maxwell, is an exception.)
On Venus there are volcanic features all over
the surface. There is no evidence of massive tec-
tonic movement although local deformations can
exist. Small volcanoes are evenly distributed but
big ones are concentrated mainly on highlands.
The origin of the latter may resemble that of the
Hawaiian volcanoes: the volcanoes are located
above a “hot spot” of the mantle. in a place where
currents of the mantle move hot magma towards
the surface.
Venus has more volcanoes than any other
planet in the solar system. Over 1500 major vol-
canoes or volcanic features are known, and there
may even be one million smaller ones. Most are
shield volcanoes, but there are also many com-
plex features. None are known to be active at
present, although large variations of sulphur diox-
ide in the atmosphere may indicate that some vol-
canoes are active.
Almost all volcanism on Venus seems to in-
volve ﬂuid lava ﬂows without any explosive erup-

centre of the image is a corona, approximately 200 km in
diameter. North of the corona is a 35 km ﬂat-topped vol-
canic construct known as a pancake dome. Complex frac-
ture patterns like in the upper right of the image are often
observed in association with coronas and various volcanic
features. (NASA/JPL). (Bottom): The surface of Venus

tions. Due to the high air pressure, Venusian lavas
need a much higher gas content than the Earth
lavas to erupt explosively. The main gas driv-
ing lava explosions on the Earth is water vapour,
which does not exist on Venus.
Flat-topped volcanic constructs known as pan-
cake domes are probably formed by the eruption
of an extremely viscous lava. A corona is a cir-
cular trench surrounding an elevated plain, the
diameter of which can be as big as several hun-
dreds of kilometres. They are possibly examples
of local hot spots, mantle upwellings that have
expanded and formed bulges. When the ﬂow has
stopped, the bulge has sunk and formed a set of
ring mountains.
In other places ﬂuid lava ﬂows have produced
long, sinuous channels extending for hundreds of
kilometres.
Venus has no large scale tectonic activity. The
reason may be the thinner and weaker crust and
lack of water; therefore there are no large subduc-
tion zones between continents. Instead, the crust
can consist of local zones only. Since the inter-
nal heat cannot ﬂow out like on the Earth, the
crust will warm up until at a critical temperature
it will collapse and be renewed in hundred mil-
lion years. The last time this happened was about
500 million years ago.
Most of the Venusian impact craters are un-
deformed. This indicates that the Venusian sur-
face must be young because erosion, volcan-
ism and tectonic forces should affect the craters,
too. Resurfacing processes may frequently cover
the old craters, and all craters visible are there-
fore young, presumably less than 500 million
years. There are no impact crates smaller than
a few kilometers because smaller meteoroids are
burned in the thick atmosphere.
The Earth and Venus are almost equal in size,
and their interiors are assumed to be similar.

Venus has an iron core about 3000 km in radius
and a molten rocky mantle covering the majority
of the planet. Probably due to its slow rotation,
however, Venus has no magnetic ﬁeld. The anal-
yses made by the Venera landers have shown that
the surface material of Venus is similar to terres-
trial granite and basalt.
About 1 % of the incident light reaches the
surface of Venus; this light is deep red after trav-
elling through clouds and the thick atmosphere.
Most of the incident light, about 75 %, is reﬂected
back from the upper layers of clouds. The ab-
sorbed light is emitted back in infrared. The car-
bon dioxide atmosphere very effectively prevents
the infrared radiation from escaping, and the tem-
perature had not reached the equilibrium until at
750 K.
In spite of the thick layer of clouds, the visibil-
ity on the surface is several kilometres, and even
in the clouds, a few hundred metres. Therefore,
the clouds are relatively transparent. The densest
clouds are at a height of 50 km, but their thick-
ness is only 2–3 km. Above this, there are haze-
like layers which form the visible “surface” of the
planet. The uppermost clouds move rapidly; they
rotate around the planet in about 4 days, pushed
by strong winds powered by the Sun. The ﬂow
patterns of the clouds are best visible in ultravio-
let light. The sulphuric acid droplets do not rain
on the Venusian surface but they evaporate in the
lower atmosphere before reaching the surface.
Venus’ atmosphere is very dry: the amount of
water vapour present is only 1/1,000,000 of that
in the Earth’s atmosphere. One possible explana-
tion is that, due to solar UV radiation, the water
has dissociated to hydrogen and oxygen in the up-
per layers of the atmosphere, the former escaping
into interplanetary space.
Venus has no satellites.
8.3
The Earth and the Moon
The third planet from the Sun, the Earth, and its
satellite, the Moon, form almost a double planet.
The relative size of the Moon is larger than that
of any other satellite, excluding the moon of the
dwarf planet Pluto. Usually satellites are much
smaller than their parent planets.
Fig. 8.6 Internal structure of the Earth. The speed of
the seismic waves, density, pressure, and temperature are
shown as a function of depth. The crust, lithosphere, lower
mantle and inner core are solid, the outer mantle is molten
and the asthenosphere is partly molten
The Earth is a unique body, since a consid-
erable amount of free water is found on its sur-
face. This is possible only because the temper-
ature is above the freezing point and below the
boiling point of water and the atmosphere is thick
enough. The Earth is also the only planet where
life is known to exist. (Whether it is intelligent or
not is yet to be resolved...). The moderate tem-
perature and the water are essential for terrestrial
life, although some life forms can be found in ex-
treme conditions.
The diameter of the Earth is 12,000 km. At the
centre, there is an iron–nickel core where the tem-
perature is 5000 K, the pressure 3 × 1011 Nm−2
and the density 12,000 kg m−3 (Fig. 8.6).
The core is divided into two layers, inner and
outer core. The inner core, below 5150 km com-
prises only of 1.7 % of the mass of the Earth. It is

8.3
The Earth and the Moon
189
solid because of high pressure. The nonexistence
of the seismic transverse S waves below a depth
of 2890 km indicates that the outer core is molten.
However, the speed of the longitudinal P waves
change rapidly at a depth of 5150 km showing an
obvious phase transition. It has been discovered
that the solid inner core rotates with respect to
the outer core and mantle.
The outer core comprises about 31 % of the
mass of the Earth. It is a hot, electrically conduct-
ing layer of liquid Fe–Ni where the convective
motions take place. There are strong currents in
the conductive layer that are responsible for the
magnetic ﬁeld.
Between the outer core and the lower mantle
there is a 200 km thick transition layer. Although
this D′′ layer is often included as a part of the
lower mantle, seismic discontinuities suggest that
it might differ chemically from the lower mantle.
A silicate mantle extends from 2890 km up-
ward up to a depth of few tens of kilometres. The
part below 650 km is often identiﬁed as the lower
mantle. It contains about 49 % of the mass and
is composed mainly of silicon, magnesium, and
oxygen but some iron, calcium, and aluminium
may also exist. The major minerals are olivine
(Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and pyroxene (Mg,Fe)SiO3. Un-
der pressure the material behaves like a viscous
liquid or an amorphous medium, resulting in slow
vertical ﬂows.
Between the lower and upper mantle there is
a 250 km thick transition region or mesosphere. It
is the source of basaltic magmas and is rich in cal-
cium and aluminium. The upper mantle, between
some tens of kilometres down to 400 km contains
about 10 % of the mass. Part of the upper man-
tle, called the asthenosphere, might be partially
molten.
A thin crust ﬂoats on the mantle. The thick-
ness of the crust is only 10–65 km; it is thick-
est below high mountain ranges such as the
Himalayas and thinnest below the mid-ocean
basins. The seismic discontinuity showing the
border between the crust and mantle was discov-
ered in 1909 by the Croatian scientist Andrija
Mohoroviˇci´c, and it is now known as the Moho
discontinuity.
The basaltic oceanic crust is very young,
mostly less than 100 million years and nowhere
more than 200 Ma. It is made through tectonic
activity at the mid-ocean ridges, where new ma-
terial is spreading out.
The continental crust is mainly composed of
crystalline rocks that are dominated by quartz
(SiO2) and feldspars (metal-poor silicates). Be-
cause the continental crust is lighter than the
oceanic
crust
(average
densities
are
about
2700 kg m−3 and 3000 kg m−3, respectively), the
continents are ﬂoating on top of other layers, and
currently they are neither created nor destroyed.
The lithosphere is the rigid outer part of the
Earth (crust and the topmost part of the upper
mantle). Below that is the partially molten as-
thenosphere where the damping of seismic waves
is stronger than in the rigid lithosphere.
The lithosphere is not a single rigid and seam-
less layer; instead it is divided into more than 20
individual plates. The plate tectonics (“continen-
tal drift”) is powered by the motion of the ma-
terial in the mantle (Fig. 8.7). New material is
ﬂowing up at the mid-ocean ridges, pushing the
tectonic plates apart. New oceanic crust is gen-
erated at the rate of 17 km3 per year. The Earth
is the only planet that shows any large-scale tec-
tonic activity. The history of the motion can be
studied by using e.g. the paleomagnetic data of
magnetic orientation of crystallised rocks.
At the end of the Precambrian era, about 700
million years ago, more than half of the conti-
nents were together forming the continent known
as Gondwana, containing Africa, South Amer-
ica, Australia and Antarctica. About 350 mil-
lion years ago Gondwana was on the South Pole
but it moved toward the equator before the ﬁnal
breakup. Mutual collisions formed new moun-
tains and ﬁnally in the beginning of the Mesozoic
era, about 200 million years ago, all the conti-
nents were joined into one supercontinent, Pan-
gaea.
Quite soon the ﬂow pattern in the mantle
changed and the Pangaea broke up. The Atlantic
Ocean is still growing and new material is ﬂow-
ing up at the mid-Atlantic ridge. North America
is drifting away from Europe at the rate of a few
centimetres per year (your ﬁngernails are grow-
ing at the same speed). At the same time, parts
of the Paciﬁc oceanic plate are disappearing be-
low other plates. When an oceanic crust is pushed

Fig. 8.7 The tectonic plates. The dots on the map indicate
the location of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5
in the years 1980–1989. Arrows show the velocities ob-
served with permanent GPS (Global Positioning System)
tracking stations. The velocity scale is shown at lower left
below a continental crust, a zone of active volca-
noes is created. The earthquakes in the subduc-
tion zones can even originate 600 km below the
surface. In the mid-ocean ridges, the depth is only
tens of kilometres.
Mountains are formed when two plates col-
lide. The push of the African plate toward the
Eurasian plate formed the Alps about 45 million
years ago. The collision of the Indian plate cre-
ated the Himalayas some 40 million years ago,
and they are still growing. The plates can also
move sideways. Earthquakes in such a fault usu-
ally occur in depths less than about 100 kilome-
tres. An example is the San Andreas fault in Cal-
ifornia.
No other planet has such large scale tectonic
activity. The interiors of Mars and Mercury are
already too cold to maintain convection in their
mantles. The structure of the crust of Venus is too
weak to move large regions. Also, the free water
of the Earth may be important in keeping up the
plate tectonics.
The climate is an efﬁcient factor reshaping the
surface. The mountains created by collisions of
tectonic plates are eroded already in a few hun-
dred million years by temperature changes, rain,
wind and ice. Impact crater disappear even faster,
and many of the currently known craters have
been found by local gravitational anomalies in-
stead of geographical features.
Most of the Earth’s surface is covered with wa-
ter. The Earth is the only planet that currently has
free running water. The water condensed from the
water vapour released in volcanic eruptions. De-
pending on glaciation, the sea level ascends or
descends by over 100 metres with respect to the
solid ground. During the last ice age the sea level
was 150 m below the current. Due to the melting
of glaciers the sea level is rising by one millimetre
per year, but the rate is increasing by the green-
house effect.
Compared with the geological time scale the
increase in the greenhouse effect caused by hu-
man activity is a very young phenomenon. Ice
ages have come and gone in periods of a time
scales of 100,000 years. The current warming of
the climate is a temporary phenomenon, which,
however, may have some effect on the beginning
of the next ice age. Although the human activi-
ties have little effect from the geological point of
view, they may have disastrous effects on the cur-
rent biosphere.
The primordial atmosphere of the Earth was
very different from the modern one; there was, for

example, no oxygen. Earlier it was assumed that
the original atmosphere was reducing, but more
recent studies seem to indicate that it was neutral.
When organic chemical processes started in the
oceans more than 2 × 109 years ago and reached
the level of photosynthesis, the amount of oxy-
gen rapidly increased (and was poison to the
ﬁrst forms of life!). The original carbon dioxide
is now mainly concentrated in carbonate rocks,
such as limestone, and the methane was disso-
ciated by solar UV radiation. The current atmo-
sphere has very little resemblance to the early at-
mosphere a couple of billion years ago.
The Earth’s main atmospheric constituents are
nitrogen (77 % by volume) and oxygen (21 %).
Other gases, such as argon, carbon dioxide, and
water vapour are present in minor amounts. The
chemical composition is unchanged in the lower
part of the atmosphere, called the troposphere.
Most of the climatic phenomena occur in the tro-
posphere, which reaches up to 8–10 km (Fig. 8.8).
The height of the layer is variable, being lowest at
the poles, and highest at the equator, where it can
extend up to 18 km.
The layer above the troposphere is the strato-
sphere, extending up to 60 km. The boundary
between the troposphere and the stratosphere
is called the tropopause. In the troposphere,
the temperature decreases 5–7 K/km, but in the
stratosphere it begins to rise, due to the absorp-
tion of solar radiation by carbon dioxide, wa-
ter vapour and ozone. The ozone layer, which
shields the Earth from the solar UV radiation, is
at a height of 20–25 km.
A total of 99 % of air is in the troposphere
and stratosphere. The stratopause at a height of
50–60 km separates the stratosphere from the
mesosphere.
The mesosphere extends up to 85 km. In this
layer, the temperature decreases again, reaching
the minimum of about −90 °C at the height of
80–90 km in the mesopause. Chemicals in the
mesosphere are mostly in an excited state, as they
absorb energy from the Sun.
Above the mesopause is the thermosphere that
extends up to 500 kilometres. The temperatures
increases with altitude and can be above 1200 °C
at the height of 500 km. The gas is in the form of
a fully ionised plasma. Therefore, the layer above
the mesopause is also called the ionosphere.
The density of air below a height of 150 km
is high enough to cause colliding meteoroids to

burn into ashes due to friction. It also plays an
important role in radio communications, since ra-
dio waves are reﬂected by the ionosphere. Auro-
ras are phenomena of the upper part of the iono-
sphere.
The thermosphere goes over into the exo-
sphere at about 500 km. There the air pressure is
much lower than in the best laboratory vacuums.
The magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth is generated by
ﬂows in its core. The ﬁeld is almost a dipole but
there are considerable local and temporal varia-
tions. The mean ﬁeld strength close to the equa-
tor is 3.1×10−5 Tesla (0.31 Gauss). The dipole is
tilted 11◦with respect to the Earth’s axis, but the
direction gradually changes with time. Currently
the ﬁeld is decreasing about 30 nT a year and
moving counterclockwise; however, the angle be-
tween the magnetic axis and the rotation axis re-
mains nearly constant. Moreover, the magnetic
north and south poles have exchanged places sev-
eral times during the past, once every 100,000–
1,000,000 years. The last time this happened was
about 780,000 years ago.
The Moon
Our nearest neighbour in space is
the Moon (Fig. 8.9). Its motion was described in
Sect. 7.4. Dark and light areas are visible even
with the naked eye. For historical reasons, the for-
mer are called seas or maria (from Latin, mare,
sea, pl. maria). The lighter areas are uplands but
the maria have nothing in common with terres-
trial seas, since there is no water on the Moon.
Numerous craters, all meteorite impacts, can be
seen, even with binoculars or a small telescope.
The lack of atmosphere, volcanism, and tectonic
activity help to preserve these formations.
The Moon is the best-known body after the
Earth. The ﬁrst man landed on the Moon in
1969 during the Apollo 11 ﬂight. A total of over
2000 samples, weighing 382 kg, were collected
during the six Apollo ﬂights (Fig. 8.10). More-
over, the unmanned Soviet Luna spacecraft col-
lected and returned about 310 grams of Lunar
soil. Instruments placed on the Moon by the
Apollo astronauts operated as long as eight years.
These included seismometers, which detected
moonquakes and meteorite impacts, and passive
laser reﬂectors which made exact Earth–Moon
distance measurements possible. The reﬂectors
are still used for Lunar laser ranging (LLR) mea-
surements.
Seismometric and gravimetric measurements
have supplied basic information on the internal
structure of the Moon. Moonquakes take place

8.3

(NASA)
at a depth of 800–1000 km, considerably deeper
than earthquakes, and they are also much weaker
than on the Earth. Most of the quakes occur at
the boundary of the solid mantle, the lithosphere,
and the asthenosphere (Fig. 8.11). The transver-
sal S waves cannot penetrate the asthenosphere,
indicating that it is at least partially molten. Tidal
forces may generate at least some of the moon-
quakes because most of them occur close to
perigee or apogee.
Lunar orbiters have observed local mass con-
centrations, mascons, beneath the maria. These
are large basaltic blocks, formed after the huge
impacts which produced the maria. The craters
were ﬁlled by lava ﬂows during the next billion
years or so in several phases. This can be seen,
e.g. in the area of Mare Imbrium. Large maria
were formed about 4×109 years ago when mete-
orite bombardment was much heavier than today.
The last 3 × 109 years have been quite peaceful,
without any major events.
The centre of mass is not at the geometric cen-
tre of the Moon but about 2.5 km away due to
the 20–30 km thick basaltic plates below the large
maria. Moreover, the thickness of the crust varies,
being the thickest at the far side of the Moon,
Fig. 8.11 Structure of the Moon. The height differences
of the surface are strongly exaggerated
about 100 km. On the near side the thickness of
the crust is about 60 km.
The mean density of the Moon is 3400 kg m−3,
which is comparable to that of basaltic lavas on
the Earth. The Moon is covered with a layer of
soil with scattered rocks, regolith. It consists of
the debris blasted out by meteorite impacts. The
original surface is nowhere visible. The thickness
of the regolith is estimated to be at least tens of
metres. A special type of rock, breccia, which

194
8
Objects of the Solar System
is a fragment of different rocks compacted and
welded together by meteor impacts, is found ev-
erywhere on the Moon.
The maria are mostly composed of dark ba-
salts, which form from rapid cooling of massive
lava ﬂows. The highlands are largely composed
of anorthosite, an igneous rock that forms when
lava cools more slowly than in the case of basalts.
This implies that the rocks of the maria and high-
lands cooled at different rates from the molten
state and were formed under different conditions.
Data returned by the Lunar Prospector and
Clementine spacecraft indicated that water ice is
present at both the north and south lunar poles.
Data indicates that there may be nearly pure wa-
ter ice buried beneath the dry regolith. The ice is
concentrated at the bottoms of deep valleys and
craters that are in a permanent shadow where the
temperature is below 100 K.
The Moon has no global magnetic ﬁeld. Some
of the rocks have remanent magnetism indicat-
ing a possible global magnetic ﬁeld early in
the Moon’s history. Without the atmosphere and
magnetic ﬁeld, the solar wind can reach the
Moon’s surface directly. The ions from the solar
wind have embedded in the regolith. Thus sam-
ples returned by the Apollo missions proved valu-
able in studies of the solar wind.
The origin of the Moon is still uncertain; it has,
however, not been torn off from the Earth at the
Paciﬁc Ocean, as is sometimes believed. The Pa-
ciﬁc is less than 200 million years old and formed
as a result of continental drift. Also, the chemical
composition of the lunar soil is different from that
of terrestrial material.
Recently it was suggested that the Moon was
formed in the early stages of the formation of the
Earth, when a lot of protoplanet embryos were
orbiting the Sun. An off-axis collision of a Mars-
size body resulted in ejection of a large amount
of debris, a part of which then accreted to form
the Moon. Differences in chemical compositions
of the modern Earth and the Moon can be ex-
plained with the theory, as well as the orientation
and evolution of the Moon’s orbit and the Earth’s
relatively fast spin rate.
Box 8.1 (Atmospheric Phenomena) The best-
known atmospheric phenomenon is the rain-
bow, which is due to the refraction of light
from water droplets. The radius of the arc of
the rainbow is about 41◦and the width, 1.7◦.
The centre of the arc is opposite the Sun (or
any other source of light). When the light is re-
fracted inside a water droplet, it is divided into
a spectrum, where the red colour is at the outer
edge and blue, at the inner edge. Light can be
reﬂected twice inside the droplet, resulting in
a secondary rainbow outside the primary one.
The colours of the secondary rainbow are in re-
versed order and its radius is 52◦. A rainbow
caused by the Moon is usually very weak and
colourless, since the human eye is incapable of
resolving colours of a dim object.
A halo results when the solar or lunar light
is reﬂected from atmospheric ice crystals. The
most common halo is a 22◦arc or circle around
the Sun or the Moon. Usually the halo is white,
but occasionally even bright colours can be
seen. Another common form is the side lobes
which are at the same height as the Sun but
at a distance of 22◦from it. All other forms
of halo are less common. The best “weather”
for halos is when there are cirrostratus or cirrus
clouds or an icy fog in the sky.
Noctilucent clouds are thin formations of
cloud, at a height of approximately 80 km. The
clouds contain particles, which are less than
one micron in diameter, and become visible
only when the Sun (which is below the hori-
zon) illuminates the clouds. Most favourable
conditions are at the northern latitudes during
the summer nights when the Sun is only a few
degrees below the horizon.
The night sky is never absolutely dark. One
reason (in addition to light pollution) is the air-
glow or light emitted by excited atmospheric
molecules. Most of the radiation is in the in-
frared domain, but e.g. the forbidden line of
oxygen at 558 nm, has also been detected.
The same greenish oxygen line is clearly
seen in auroras, which are formed at a height
of 80–300 km. Auroras can be seen mainly
from relatively high northern or southern lati-

tudes because the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld forces
charged particles, coming from the Sun, close
toward the magnetic poles. Alaska and north-
ern Scandinavia are the best places to observe
auroras. Occasionally, auroras can be seen as
far south as 40◦. They are usually greenish or
yellow-green, but red auroras have been ob-
served, too. They most commonly appear as
arcs, which are often dim and motionless, or as
belts, which are more active and may contain
rapidly varying vertical rays.
Meteors (also called shooting stars although
they have nothing to do with stars) are small
grains of sand, a few micrograms or grams in
weight, which hit the Earth’s atmosphere. Due
to friction, the body heats up and starts to glow
at a height of 100 km. Some 20–40 km lower,
the whole grain has burnt to ashes. The dura-
tion of a typical meteor is less than a second.
The brightest meteors are called bolides (mag-
nitude smaller than about −2). Even larger par-

8.4
Mars
Mars is the outermost of the terrestrial planets.
Its diameter is only half of that of the Earth. Seen
through a telescope, Mars seems to be a reddish
disk with dark spots and white polar caps. The po-
lar caps wax and wane with the Martian seasons,
indicating that they are composed of ice. Darker
areas were suspected to be vegetation. At the end
of the 19th century, an Italian astronomer, Gio-
vanni Schiaparelli claimed that there are canals
on Mars.
In the United States, the famous planetary
astronomer Percival Lowell studied the canals
and even published books on the topic. Martians
were also very popular in science ﬁction litera-
ture. Now the canals are known to be nonexis-
tent, an optical illusion when the obscure details
at the limit of visibility seem to form straight
lines, canals. Finally, the ﬁrst clear pictures by
Mariner 4 in 1965 buried even the most optimistic
hopes concerning life on Mars. Later spacecraft
revealed more details of the planet.
Mars is a superior planet, which means that it
is most easily observable when it is closest to the
Earth, i.e. during opposition, when the planet is
above the horizon all night long.
The rotation axis of Mars is tilted 25◦to the
ecliptic, about the same amount as the Earth’s
axis. A Martian day is only half an hour longer
than a terrestrial day. Mars’ orbit is signiﬁcantly
elliptical, resulting in temperature variations of
about 30 °C at the subsolar point between the
aphelion and perihelion. This has a major inﬂu-
ence on the climate. Huge dust storms are oc-
casionally seen on Mars (Fig. 8.12). Usually the
storms begin when Mars is at the perihelion.
Heating of the surface gives rise to large temper-
ature differences that in turn cause strong winds.
The wind-driven dust absorbs more heat and ﬁ-
nally the whole planet is covered by a dust storm
where the wind speeds exceed 100 m/s.
The atmosphere of Mars is mainly composed
of carbon dioxide (95 %). It contains only 2 % ni-
trogen and 0.1–0.4 % oxygen. The atmosphere
is very dry: if all the moisture were condensed
on the surface, the water layer would be thin-
ner than 0.1 mm. Even the minor amount of wa-

ter vapour is sufﬁcient to occasionally form some
thin clouds or haze.
The air pressure is only 5–8 mbar. A part of
the atmosphere has escaped but it is probable that
Mars never had a thick atmosphere. The primor-
dial atmosphere of Mars was, however, somewhat
similar to that of the Earth. Almost all of its car-
bon dioxide was used up to form carbonate rocks.
Because there are no plate tectonics on Mars, the
carbon dioxide was not recycled back into the at-
mosphere as on the Earth. Therefore, the green-
house effect on Mars is signiﬁcantly smaller than
on the Earth.
Craters were already found in the ﬁrst pictures.
The southern hemisphere is especially marked by
craters, indicating that the original surface is still
visible there. The largest impacts, Hellas and Ar-
gyre are about 2000 km in diameter. On the other
hand, the northern hemisphere has an abundance
of large lava basins and volcanoes (Fig. 8.15).
The surface is younger than in the southern hemi-
sphere. The largest volcano, Olympus Mons, pro-
trudes more than 20 km above the surround-
ing terrain. The diameter at the bottom is about
600 km.
There are no active volcanoes on Mars. The
mare-like plains on Mars are of the same age as
the Lunar maria, about 3×109 years old. Volcan-
ism in the highland and mare-like plains stopped
at that time, but the giant shield volcanoes are
much younger, possibly 1–2 × 109 years. The
youngest lava ﬂows on Olympus Mons are pos-
sibly less than 100 million years old. Mars shows
no sign of plate tectonics. It has no mountain
chains, nor any global patterns of volcanism.
There are also several canyons, the largest of
which is Valles Marineris (Fig. 8.13). Its length
is 5000 km, width 200 km, and depth about
6 km. Compared with Valles Marineris, the Grand
Canyon is merely a scratch on the surface.
Ancient riverbeds (Fig. 8.15), too small to be
seen from the Earth, were also discovered by
spacecraft. Rivers were probably formed soon af-
ter the formation of Mars itself, when there was
a great deal of water and the atmospheric pres-
sure and temperature were higher. At present, the
temperature and air pressure on Mars are too low
for free water to exist, although there have been
speculations on warm weather cycles in the more
recent history of the planet. The mean temper-
ature is now below −50 °C and, on a warm
summer day, the temperature can rise close to
zero near the equator. Most of the water is con-
tained in kilometres deep permafrost below the

surface and in the polar caps. The theory was con-
ﬁrmed in 2002, when the Mars Odyssey space-
craft detected a large supply of subsurface wa-
ter ice of a wide area near the south pole. The
ice is mixed into the soil a meter below the sur-
face. Two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, oper-
ating on the Mars discovered in 2004 minerals
like hematite and goethite which proved the ex-
istence of liquid water on the surface of Mars.
The period when the liquid water existed is un-
known.
The polar caps are composed both of water
and carbon dioxide ice. The northern cap is al-
most season-independent, extending down to lati-
tude 70◦. On the other hand, the southern cap,
which reaches to the latitude −60◦in the south-
ern winter, disappears almost totally during the
summer. The southern cap consists mostly of
CO2 ice. The permanent parts are of ordinary wa-
ter ice, since the temperature, −73 °C, is too high
for CO2 ice. The water ice layers can be hundreds
of metres thick.
The dark areas are not vegetation, but loose
dust, moved around by strong winds. These winds
raise the dust high into the atmosphere, colouring
the Martian sky red. The Mars landers have re-

vealed a reddish regolithic surface, scattered with
boulders (Fig. 8.14). The red colour is caused
mainly by iron oxide, rust; already in the 1950’s,
the existence of limonite (2 FeO3 3 H2O) was de-
duced from polarisation measurements. The on-
site analysis showed that the soil consists of
13 % iron and 21 % silicon. The abundance of
sulphur was found to be ten times that found on
the Earth.
The interior of Mars is not well known.
Mars has probably a dense core approximately
1500 km in radius, a molten rocky mantle which
is denser than the Earth’s mantle and a thin crust.
The crust is 80 km thick in the southern hemi-
sphere but only about 35 km thick in the northern
one. The low mean density compared with other
terrestrial planets may indicate that in addition to
iron the core contains a relatively large fraction
of sulphur.
The Mars Global Surveyor conﬁrmed in 1997
a weak magnetic ﬁeld. It is probably a remnant of
an earlier global ﬁeld that has since disappeared.
This has important implications for the structure
of Mars’ interior. There are no electric currents
creating a magnetic ﬁeld and therefore the core
may be (at least partially) solid.
Three biological experiments of the Viking
landers in 1976 searched for signs of life. No or-
ganic compounds were found—however, the bi-
ological tests did give some unexpected results.
A closer look at the results indicated no life, but
some uncommon chemical reactions.
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos
(Fig. 8.16). The size of Phobos is roughly 27 km×
21 km × 19 km, and the orbital period around
Mars is only 7 h 39 min. In the Martian sky, Pho-
bos rises in the west and sets in the east. Deimos
is smaller. Its diameter is 15 km×12 km×11 km.
The orbital period of Deimos is slightly over 30
hours, or just six hours longer than the rotation
period of Mars. The synodic period of Deimos is
nearly 5.5 days, and so it will stay over 2.5 days
above the Martian horizon.
There are craters on both moons. Polarimetric
and photometric results show that they are com-
posed of material resembling carbonaceous chon-
drite meteorites.
8.5
Jupiter
The realm of terrestrial planets ends at the aster-
oid belt. Outside this, the relative abundance of
volatile elements is higher and the original com-
position of the solar nebula is still preserved in
the giant planets. The ﬁrst and largest is Jupiter.
Its mass is 2.5 times the total mass of all other
planets, almost 1/1000 of the solar mass. The
bulk of Jupiter is mainly hydrogen and helium.
The relative abundance of these elements are ap-
proximately the same as in the Sun, and the den-
sity is of the same order of magnitude, namely
1330 kg m−3.
During oppositions, the angular diameter of
Jupiter is as large as 50′′. The dark belts and

lighter zones are visible even with a small tele-
scope. These are cloud formations, parallel to the
equator (Fig. 8.17). The most famous detail is the
Great Red Spot, a huge cyclone, rotating coun-
terclockwise once every six days. The spot was
discovered by Giovanni Cassini in 1655; it has
survived for centuries, but its true age is unknown
(Fig. 8.18).
The rotation of Jupiter is rapid; one revolu-
tion takes 9 h 55 min 29.7 s. This is the period
determined from the variation of the magnetic
ﬁeld, and it reﬂects the speed of Jupiter’s inte-
riors where the magnetic ﬁeld is born. As might
be expected, Jupiter does not behave like a rigid
body. The rotation period of the clouds is about
ﬁve minutes longer in the polar region than at the
equator. Due to its rapid rotation, Jupiter is non-
spherical; ﬂattening is as large as 1/15.
There is possibly an iron-nickel core in the
centre of Jupiter. The mass of the core is proba-
bly equal to a few tens of Earth masses. The core
is surrounded by a layer of metallic liquid hy-
drogen, where the temperature is over 10,000 K
and the pressure, three million atm. Owing to this
huge pressure, the hydrogen is dissociated into
single atoms, a state unknown in ordinary labora-
tory environments. In this exotic state, hydrogen
has many features typical of metals. This layer
is electrically conductive, giving rise to a strong
magnetic ﬁeld. Closer to the surface where the
pressure is lower, the hydrogen is present as nor-
mal molecular hydrogen, H2. At the top there is
a 1000 km thick atmosphere.
The atmospheric state and composition of
Jupiter has been accurately measured by the
spacecraft. In situ observations were obtained in
1995, when the probe of the Galileo spacecraft
was dropped into Jupiter’s atmosphere. It sur-
vived nearly an hour before crushing under the
pressure, collecting the ﬁrst direct measurements
of Jupiter’s atmosphere.
Belts and zones are stable cloud formations.
Their width and colour may vary with time, but
the semi-regular pattern can be seen up to the lat-
itude 50◦. The colour of the polar areas is close to
that of the belts. The belts are reddish or brown-

ish, and the motion of the gas inside a belt is
downward. The gas ﬂows upward in the white
zones. The clouds in the zones are slightly higher
and have a lower temperature than those in the
belts. Strong winds or jet streams blow along the
zones and belts. The speed of the wind reaches
150 m/s at some places in the upper atmosphere.
According to the measurements of the Galileo
probe, the wind speeds in the lower cloud lay-
ers can reach up to 500 m/s. This indicates that
the winds in deeper atmospheric layers are driven
by the outﬂowing ﬂux of the internal heat, not the
solar heating.
The colour of the Great Red Spot (GRS) re-
sembles the colour of the belts (Fig. 8.18). Some-
times it is almost colourless, but shows no signs
of decrepitude. The GRS is 14,000 km wide and
30,000–40,000 km long. Some smaller red and
white spots can also be observed on Jupiter, but
their lifetime is generally much less than a few
years.
The ratio of helium to hydrogen in the deep
atmosphere is about the same as in the Sun. The
results of the Galileo spacecraft gave consider-
ably higher abundance than previous estimates.
It means that there are no signiﬁcant differenti-
ation of helium, i.e. helium is not sinking to the
interior of the planet as was expected according
to the earlier results. Other compounds found in
the atmosphere include methane, ethane and am-
monia. The temperature in the cloud tops is about
130 K.
Jupiter radiates twice the amount of heat that
it receives from the Sun. This heat is a remnant
of the energy released in the gravitational con-
traction during the formation of the planet. Thus
Jupiter is still gradually cooling. The internal heat
is transferred outward by convection; this gives
rise to ﬂows in the metallic hydrogen, causing the
strong magnetic ﬁeld.
The ring of Jupiter (Fig. 8.19) was discovered
in 1979. The innermost toroid-shaped halo is be-
tween 92,000–122,500 km from Jupiter’s centre.
It consists of dust falling from the main ring to-
ward the planet. The main ring extends from the
halo boundary out to about 128,940 km, just in-

Fig. 8.19 Mosaic of Jupiter’s ring system taken by the
Galileo spacecraft when the spacecraft was in Jupiter’s
shadow looking back toward the Sun. Jupiter’s ring sys-
tem is composed of three parts: a thin outermost ring, a ﬂat
main ring, and an innermost doughnut-shaped halo. These
rings are made up of dust-sized particles that originate
from Io, or are blasted off from the nearby inner satellites
by small impacts. (NASA/University of Arizona)
side the orbit of the moon Adrastea. The ring
particles are small, a few microns only, and they
scatter light forward much more effectively than
backward. Therefore, they were not discovered
prior the Voyager ﬂyby. A ring consisting of such
small particles cannot be stable, and new material
must enter the ring continuously. Possible sources
are the small moons Adrastea and Metis.
The two faint outermost rings are fairly uni-
form in nature. The inner of them extends from
the orbit of Adrastea out to the orbit of Amalthea
at 181,000 km. The fainter outermost ring ex-
tends out to Thebe’s orbit at 221,000 km.
Jupiter’s rings and moons exist within an in-
tense radiation belt of Jupiter’s magnetic ﬁeld.
The magnetosphere extends 3–7 million kilome-
tres toward the Sun, depending on the strength
of the solar wind. In the opposite direction it
stretches to a distance of at least 750 million kilo-
metres, behind Saturn’s orbit.
Jupiter is an intense radio source. Its radio
emission can be divided into three components,
namely thermal millimetre and centimetre radia-
tion, nonthermal decimetric radiation and burstal-
decametric radiation. The nonthermal emission is
most interesting; it is partly synchrotron radia-
tion, generated by relativistic electrons in the Jo-
vian magnetosphere. Its intensity varies in phase
with Jupiter’s rotation; thus the radio emission
can be used for determining the exact rotation
rate. The decametric bursts are related to the po-
sition of the innermost large moon, Io, and are
possibly generated by the electric current of mil-
lions of Amperes observed between Jupiter and
the plasma torus at the orbit of Io. Also auroras
are common in Jupiter (Fig. 8.20).
In the beginning of year 2016 there were
67 known moons of Jupiter, but probably more
small satellites will be found in the future. The
four largest, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto
are called the Galilean satellites (Fig. 8.21), in
honour of Galileo Galilei, who discovered them
in 1610. The Galilean satellites can already be
seen with ordinary binoculars. They are the size
of the Moon or even planet Mercury. The other
moons are small, most of them only a few kilo-
metres in diameter.
Owing to tidal forces, the orbits of Io, Eu-
ropa and Ganymede have been locked into a res-
onance, so that their longitudes λ strictly satisfy
the equation
λIo −3λEuropa + 2λGanymede = 180◦.
(8.1)
Hence the moons can never be in the same direc-
tion when seen from Jupiter.
Io is the innermost Galilean satellite. It is a lit-
tle larger than the Moon. Its surface is spotted by
numerous calderas, volcanoes without a moun-
tain. The molten material is ejected up to a height
of 250 km, and a part of the gas gets into Io’s or-

bit. The volcanic activity on Io is much stronger
than on the Earth. There is a 100 m bulk of
the permanent tide raised by Jupiter. Due to
the orbital perturbations caused by Europa and
Ganymede the orbit of Io is slightly elliptical and
therefore the orbital speed varies. The tidal bulk
is forced to move with respect to the surface. This
generates friction, which is transformed to heat.
This heat keeps the sulphur compounds molten
beneath the colourful surface of Io. No traces of
impact craters are visible. The whole surface is
new, being renewed continuously by eruptions.
There is no water on Io.
Europa is the smallest of the Galilean satel-
lites, a little smaller than the Moon. The surface
is ice-covered and the geometric albedo is as high
as 0.6. The surface is smooth with only a few fea-
tures more than a hundred metres high. Most of
the markings seem to be albedo features with very
low relief. Only a few impact craters have been
found indicating that the surface is young. The
surface is renewed by fresh water, trickling from
the internal ocean. Galileo spacecraft has found
a very weak magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld varies pe-
riodically as it passes through Jupiter’s magnetic
ﬁeld. This shows that there is a conducting mate-
rial beneath Europa’s surface, most likely a salty
ocean that could even be 100 km deep. At the cen-
tre, there is a solid silicate core.
Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar sys-
tem. Its diameter is 5300 km; it is larger than
the planet Mercury. The density of craters on the
surface varies, indicating that there are areas of
different ages. Ganymede’s surface is partly very
old, highly cratered dark regions, and somewhat
younger but still ancient lighter regions marked
with an extensive array of grooves and ridges.
They have a tectonic origin, but the details of the
formations are unknown. About 50 % of the mass
of the moon is water or ice, the other half being
silicates (rocks). Contrary to Callisto, Ganymede
is differentiated: a small iron or iron/sulphur core
surrounded by a rocky silicate mantle with an
icy (or liquid water) shell on top. Ganymede has
a weak magnetic ﬁeld.
Callisto is the outermost of the large moons.
It is dark; its geometric albedo is less than 0.2.
Callisto seems to be undifferentiated, with only
a slight increase of rock toward the centre. About
40 % of Callisto is ice and 60 % rock/iron. The
ancient surface is peppered by meteorite craters;
no signs of tectonic activity are visible. How-
ever, there have been some later processes, be-
cause small craters have mostly been obliterated
and ancient craters have collapsed.
The currently known moons can be divided
into four different groups: small moons inside the

lites, and two groups of irregular moons outside
the orbit of the Galilean satellites. The moons of
the inner distant group move on direct orbits, and
the moons of the most distant group on retrograde
orbits. It is possible that many of these are small
asteroids captured by Jupiter.
8.6
Saturn
Saturn (Fig. 8.22) is the second largest planet. Its
diameter is about 120,000 km, ten times the diam-
eter of the Earth, and the mass, 95 Earth masses.
The density is only 700 kg m−3, less than the
density of water. The rotation axis is tilted about
27◦with respect to the orbital plane, so every 15
years, the northern or the southern pole is well
observable.
The rotation period is 10 h 39.4 min, deter-
mined from the periodic variation of the magnetic
Fig. 8.23 A schematic drawing of the structure of the
Saturnian rings. The brightest A and B rings can be seen
even with a small telescope; the other ones are very faint
ﬁeld by the Voyager spacecraft in 1981. However,
Cassini spacecraft observed in 2004 the period
of 10 h 45 min. The reason for the change is un-
known. Due to the rapid rotation, Saturn is ﬂat-
tened; the ﬂattening is 1/10, which can be easily
seen even with a small telescope.
The internal structure of Saturn resembles that
of Jupiter. Due to its smaller size, the metallic hy-
drogen layer is not so thick as on Jupiter. The
thermal radiation of Saturn is 2.8 times that of
the incoming solar ﬂux. The heat excess origi-
nates from the differentiation of helium. The he-
lium atoms are gradually sinking inward and the
released potential energy is radiated out as a ther-
mal radiation. The abundance of helium in Sat-
urn’s atmosphere is only about half of that on
Jupiter.
The winds, or jet streams, are similar to those
of Jupiter but Saturn’s appearance is less colour-
ful. Viewed from the Earth, Saturn is a yellowish
disk without any conspicuous details. The clouds
have fewer features than those on Jupiter, be-
cause a haze, composed of hydrogen, ammonium
and methane ﬂoats above the cloud tops. Further-
more, Saturn is farther from the Sun than Jupiter
and thus has a different energy budget.
The temperature at the cloud tops is about
94 K. Close to the equator the wind speeds ex-
ceed 400 m/s and the zone in which the direc-
tion of the wind remains the same extends 40◦
from the equator. Such high speeds cannot be ex-
plained with external solar heat, but the reason for
the winds is the internal ﬂux of heat.
Saturn’s most remarkable feature is a thin ring
system (Figs. 8.23, 8.24), lying in the planet’s

206

Objects of the Solar System
equatorial plane. The Saturnian rings can be seen
even with a small telescope. The rings were dis-
covered by Galileo Galilei in 1610; only 45 years
later did Christian Huygens establish that the for-
mation observed was actually a ring, and not
two oddly behaving bulbs, as they appeared to
Galileo. In 1857 James Clerk Maxwell showed
theoretically that the rings cannot be solid but
must be composed of small particles.
The rings are made of normal water ice. The
size of the ring particles ranges from microns to
truck-size chunks. Most of the particles are in
range of centimetres to metres. The width of the
ring system is more than 60,000 km (about the ra-
dius of Saturn) and the thickness, at most 100 m,
and possibly only a few metres. Cassini space-
craft discovered also molecular oxygen around
the rings, probably as a product of the disintegra-
tion of water ice from the rings.
According to Earth-based observations, the
rings are divided into three parts, called simply
A, B, and C. The innermost C ring is 17,000 km
wide and consists of very thin material. There is
some material even inside this (referred to as the
D ring), and a haze of particles may extend down
to the clouds of Saturn.
The B ring is the brightest ring. Its total width
is 26,000 km, but the ring is divided into thou-
sands of narrow ringlets, seen only by the space-
craft. From the Earth, the ring seems more or less
Fig. 8.24 At a close distance, the rings can be seen to be
divided into thousands of narrow ringlets. (JPL/NASA)
uniform. Between B and A, there is a 3000 km
wide gap, the Cassini division. It is not totally
void, as was previously believed; some material
and even narrow ringlets have been found in the
division by the Voyager space probes.
The A ring is not divided into narrow ringlets
as clearly as the B ring. There is one narrow but
obvious gap, Encke’s division, close to the outer
edge of the ring. The outer edge is very sharp, due
to the “shepherd” moon, some 800 km outside the
ring. The moon prevents the ring particles from
spreading out to larger orbits. It is possible that
the appearance of B is due to yet-undiscovered
moonlets inside the ring.
The F ring, discovered in 1979, is about
3000 km outside A. The ring is only a few hun-
dred kilometres wide. On both sides there is
a small moon; these shepherds prevent the ring
from spreading. An interior moon passing a ring
particle causes the particle to move to a larger or-
bit. Similarly, at the outer edge of the ring, a sec-
ond moon forces the particles inward. The net
result is that the ring is kept narrow.
Outside the F ring, there are some zones of
very sparse material, sometimes referred to as the
G and E rings. These are merely collections of
small particles.
The Saturnian rings were possibly formed to-
gether with Saturn and are not debris from some
cosmic catastrophe, like remnants of a broken
moon. The total mass of the rings is 10−7 of the
mass of Saturn. If all ring particles were collected
together, they would form an ice ball, 600 km in
diameter.
In 2009 a very sparse ring was observed at
the distance of the moon Phoebe. It has the same
inclination as Phoebe, nearly 30◦. It has proba-
bly originated in material shattered from Phoebe
by micrometeorites. The ring extends inward to
the orbit of Iapetus. The hemispheres of Iapetus
are quite different, one side is very dark. Since
Iapetus always turns the same side towards Sat-
urn, only one hemisphere is hit by ring particles.
Eventually ice evaporates away leaving only the
dark cinder.
A total of 62 moons (in 2016) of Saturn
are known. Many of the large Saturnian moons
(Fig. 8.25) were observed by Pioneer 11 and Voy-
ager 1 and 2 spacecrafts. Some of the large moons

like Enceladus and Tethys are composed mainly
of ice. The temperature of the primeval nebula at
the distance of Saturn was so low that bodies of
pure ice could form and survive.
Some moons are dynamically interesting;
some have an exotic geological past. Outside the
F ring, there are two moonlets, Epimetheus and
Janus, almost in the same orbit; the difference of
the semimajor axes is about 50 km, less than the
radii of the moons. The inner moon is gaining on
the outer one. The moons will not collide, since
the speed of the trailing moon increases and the
moon moves outward. The speed of the leading
moon decreases and it drops inward. The moons
exchange their roles roughly every four years.
There are also several shepherding satellites, like
Atlas, Prometheus and Pandora that keep rings in
their place. Their gravitational pull prevents ring
particles from drifting away.
The innermost of the “old” moons is Mimas.
There is a huge crater, named Herschel, on Mi-

a depth of 9 km (Fig. 8.25). Bigger craters exist
in the solar system, but relative to the size of the
parent body, this is almost the biggest crater there
could be room for (otherwise the crater would be
bigger than Mimas itself). On the opposite side,
some grooves can be seen, possibly signifying
that impact has almost torn the moon apart.
The surface of the next moon, Enceladus, con-
sists of almost pure ice, and one side is nearly
craterless. Craters and grooves can be found on
the other hemisphere. Tidal forces result in vol-
canic activity where water (not lava or other “hot”
material) is discharged to the surface.
Titan is the largest of the Saturnian moons.
Its diameter is 5100 km, so it is only slightly
smaller than Jupiter’s moon Ganymede. Titan is
the only moon with a dense atmosphere. The at-
mosphere is mainly nitrogen (99 %) and methane,
and the pressure at the surface is 1.6 bar. The
temperature is about 90 K. Reddish clouds form
the visible surface some 200 km above the solid
body. The Huygens lander made measurements
and sent images of Titan in 2005. It detected lakes
of methane as well as geysers ejecting methane,
ammonia and water.
8.7
Uranus
The planets from Mercury to Saturn were already
known in antiquity. The next planet, Uranus, can-
not be seen with the naked eye.
The famous German-English amateur astrono-
mer William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781.
Herschel himself ﬁrst thought that the new ob-
ject was a comet. However, the extremely slow
motion revealed that the body was far beyond
the orbit of Saturn. Based on the ﬁrst observa-
tions, the Finnish astronomer Anders Lexell cal-
culated a circular orbit. He was one of the ﬁrst
to propose that the newly discovered object was
a planet. Johann Bode of the Berlin Observatory
suggested the name Uranus but more than ﬁve
decades passed before the name was unanimously
accepted.
The mean distance of Uranus is 19 au, and the
orbital period 84 years. The inclination of the ro-
tation axis is 98◦, which is totally different from
the other planets. Due to this uncommon geom-
etry, the poles are either lit or in darkness for
decades. The rotation period, conﬁrmed by the
Voyager 2 magnetometric measurements in 1986,
is 17.3 hours; the exact period had been uncertain
prior to the ﬂy-by.
Uranus is greenish, as viewed through a tele-
scope. Its colour is due to the strong methane ab-
sorption bands in the near-infrared. A part of the
red light is also absorbed, leaving the green and
blue part of the spectrum untouched. Uranus is
almost featureless (Fig. 8.26) because its clouds
are below a thick haze or smog. The origin of the
smog may be methane that solar radiation broke
into radicals which then formed e.g. asethylene
and ethane.

composed of a dark material. Nine rings are visible in the
picture of Voyager in 1986. Right: Rings seen in the light
scattered forward when the Voyager spacecraft was in the

The strong limb darkening caused by the smog
makes the terrestrial determination of the Uranus’
size difﬁcult. Therefore, the radius was not accu-
rately determined until 1977 during a stellar oc-
cultation caused by Uranus. The rings of Uranus
were discovered at the same time.
The internal structure of Uranus is thought
to be slightly different from that of other giant
planets. Above the innermost rocky core, there is
a layer of water, which, in turn, is surrounded by
a mantle of hydrogen and helium. The mixture of
water and ammonia and methane therein are dis-
sociated to ions under the heavy pressure. This
mixture behaves more like a molten salt than wa-
ter. The convection ﬂows in this electrically con-
ductive “sea” give rise to the Uranian magnetic

ﬁeld. The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld at the
cloud tops is comparable to the terrestrial ﬁeld.
However, Uranus is much larger then the Earth,
so the true strength of the ﬁeld is 50 times greater
than that of the Earth. The Uranian magnetic ﬁeld
is tilted 59◦with respect to the rotation axis. No
other planet has such a highly inclined magnetic
ﬁeld.
The Uranian rings (Fig. 8.27) were discovered
in 1977, during a stellar occultation. Secondary
occultations were observed before and after the
main event. A total of 13 rings are known, nine of
which were discovered in the occultation. The in-
nermost ring is broad and diffuse. All other rings
are dark and very narrow, only a few hundred me-
tres or a few kilometres wide. The Voyager 2 re-
sults showed that the rings contain very little dust,
unlike those of Jupiter and Saturn. The mean size
of the ring particles is more than 1 metre. The ring
particles are darker than practically any known
material in the solar system; the cause of this dark
colour is unknown.
There are 27 moons (2016 number) orbiting
around Uranus, ten of which were discovered by

8.8
Neptune
211
Voyager 2. The geological history of some moons
is puzzling, and many features reminiscent of an
active past can be found.
The innermost of the large moons, Miranda,
is one of the most peculiar objects discovered
(Fig. 8.28). It has several geological formations
also found elsewhere (but here they are all mixed
together), in addition to the quite unique V-
shaped formations. It is possible that Miranda’s
present appearance is the result of a vast colli-
sion that broke the moon apart; some pieces may
have later settled down, inside out. Another pe-
culiar object is Umbriel. It belongs to the ever
increasing family of unusual dark bodies (such as
the Uranian rings, one side of Iapetus and Hal-
ley’s comet). The dark surface of Umbriel is cov-
ered by craters without any traces of geological
activity.
8.8
Neptune
The orbit of Uranus was already well known in
the beginning of the 19th century. However, some
unknown perturbations displaced Uranus from
its predicted orbit. Based on these perturbations,
John Couch Adams, of Cambridge, and Urbain
Jean-Joseph Le Verrier, of Paris, independently
predicted the position of the unknown perturbing
planet.
The new planet was discovered in 1846 by Jo-
hann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory;
Le Verrier’s prediction was found to be only 1◦
off. The discovery gave rise to a heated contro-
versy as to who should be given the honour of
the discovery, since Adams’ calculations were
not published outside the Cambridge Observa-
tory. When the quarrel was settled years later,
both men were equally honoured. The discovery
of Neptune was also a great triumph of the New-
tonian theory of gravitation.
The semimajor axis of the orbit of Neptune
is 30 au and the orbital period around the Sun
165 years. The internal rotation period, conﬁrmed
by Voyager 2 in 1989, is 16 hours 7 minutes
and the rotation period of the outer layers of the
clouds is about 17 hours. The obliquity of the ro-
tation axis is 29◦but the magnetic ﬁeld is tilted
some 47◦with respect to the rotation axis. The
magnetic ﬁeld is tilted like in Uranus, but the ﬁeld
strength is much smaller.
The density of Neptune is 1638 kg m−3, and
the diameter 49,500 km. Thus the density of Nep-
Fig. 8.29 (Left) Neptune shows more features than
Uranus. In the picture of Voyager 2 the Great Dark Spot,
accompanied by bright, white clouds is well visible. Their
appearance is changing rapidly. To the south of the Great
Dark Spot is a bright feature and still farther south is an-
other dark spot. Each feature moves eastward at a different
velocity. (Right) Details of the Southern Dark Spot. The
V-shaped structure near the right edge of the bright area
indicates that the spot rotates clockwise. Unlike the Great
Red Spot on Jupiter, which rotates counterclockwise, the
material in the Neptune’s dark oval will be descending.

tune is higher than that of other giant planets. The
internal structure is quite simple: The core, com-
posed of silicates (rocks) is about 16,000 km in
diameter. This is surrounded by a layer of wa-
ter and liquid methane and the outermost gaseous
layer, atmosphere, is mainly composed of hydro-
gen and helium, methane and ethane being a mi-
nor components.
Cloud structures are more complicated than on
Uranus, and some dark spots, like in Jupiter, were
visible during the Voyager ﬂy-by (Fig. 8.29). The
speed of the winds are high, up to 400 m/s.
Like other giants, Neptune also has rings
(Fig. 8.30). The rings were discovered by Voy-
ager 2, although their existence was already ex-
pected prior the ﬂy-by. Two relatively bright but
very narrow rings are at a distance of 53,000 and
62,000 km from the centre of the planet. More-
over, there are some faint areas of ﬁne dust.
There are 14 known moons, six of which were
discovered by Voyager 2. Before the Voyager ﬂy-

metres into the atmosphere. (NASA)
by, only two of them, Triton and Nereid, were
known.
The largest of the moons, Triton, is 2700 km
in diameter, and it has a thin atmosphere, mainly
composed of nitrogen. The albedo is high: Triton
reﬂects 60–80 % of the incident light. The sur-
face is relatively young, without any considerable
impact craters (Fig. 8.31). There are some ac-
tive “geysers” of liquid nitrogen, which partly ex-
plains the high albedo and the lack of the craters.
The low surface temperature of Triton, 37 K,
means that the nitrogen is solid and covers the
surface like snow. It is the lowest surface temper-
ature known in the solar system.
8.9
Dwarf Planets
Besides actual planets there are some planet like
objects that orbit the Sun and are nearly spheri-
cal but have not managed to clear the neighbour-
hood of their orbits. The upper and lower lim-
its to the size and mass of dwarf planets are not
strictly speciﬁed. The lower limit, however, is de-
termined by the hydrostatic equilibrium shape,
but the size at which this happens may vary ac-
cording to the composition and history of the ob-
ject. It is estimated that up to 40–50 dwarf planets
will be discovered in coming years.

Dwarf Planets
213
Fig. 8.32 A small portion of the pair of pictures where Pluto was discovered in 1930. The planet is marked with an
arrow. (Lowell Observatory)
Currently, there are ﬁve dwarf planets in
the Solar System, namely Ceres, Pluto, Eris,
Haumea, and Makemake. Ceres was formerly
counted as an asteroid, Pluto was a planet and
Eris (2003 UB 313, known also by the nickname
Xena) was the ﬁrst Trans-Neptunian object which
turned out to be larger than Pluto.
Pluto
Pluto was discovered in 1930 at the Low-
ell Observatory, Arizona, after an extensive pho-
tographic search (Fig. 8.32). This search had al-
ready been initiated in the beginning of the cen-
tury by Percival Lowell, on the basis of the pertur-
bations observed in the orbits of Uranus and Nep-
tune. Finally, Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto
less than 6◦off the predicted position. However,
Pluto turned out to be far too small to cause any
perturbations on Uranus or Neptune. Thus the
discovery was purely accidental, and the pertur-
bations observed were not real, but caused by mi-
nor errors of old observations.
The orbit of Pluto is different from planetary
orbits. The eccentricity is 0.25 and the inclination
is 17◦. During its 250 year orbit, Pluto is closer
to the Sun than Neptune for 20 years; one such
period lasted from 1979 to 1999. There is no dan-
ger of Pluto and Neptune colliding, since Pluto
is high above the ecliptic when at the distance of
Neptune. Pluto’s orbital period is in a 3:2 reso-
nance with Neptune.
Pluto has no visible disk as seen with terres-
trial telescopes; instead, it resembles a point, like
a star. This fact gave an upper limit for the di-
ameter of Pluto, which turned out to be about
3000 km. The exact mass was unknown until
the discovery of the Plutonian moon, Charon, in
1978. The mass of Pluto is only 0.2 % of the
mass of the Earth. The orbital period of Charon
is 6.39 days, and this is also the period of rota-
tion of both bodies. Pluto and Charon rotate syn-
chronously, each turning the same side towards
the other body. The rotation axis of Pluto is close
to the orbital plane: the tilt is 122◦.
Mutual occultations of Pluto and Charon in
1985–1987 gave accurate diameters of each body:
The diameter of Pluto is 2300 km and that of
Charon, 1200 km. The density of Pluto turned
out to be about 2100 kg m−3. Thus Pluto is not
a huge iceball but about 2/3 of its mass is com-
posed of rocks. The relatively small abundance of
ices is possibly due to the low temperature dur-
ing the planetary accretion when most of the free
oxygen was combined with carbon forming car-
bon monoxide. The computed lower limit for wa-
ter ice is about 30 % which is fairly close to the
value observed in Pluto.
Pluto has a thin methane atmosphere and there
is possibly a thin haze over the surface. The sur-
face pressure is 10−5–10−6 atm. It has been spec-
ulated that when Pluto is far from perihelion, the
whole atmosphere will become frozen and fall on
the surface.
Pluto has ﬁve satellites. Two of them were dis-
covered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2005

Fig. 8.33 The Hubble Space Telescope photographed
Pluto and its three known moons in February 2006. The
smaller moons were found in 2005, and were later named
Nix and Hydra. Their diameter is estimated as 40–160
km. (M. Mutchler (STScI), A. Stern (SwRI), and the HST
Pluto Companion Search Team, ESA, NASA)
Fig. 8.34 The only detailed images of Pluto were sent by
the New Horizons probe in 2015. The light heart shaped
area was named the Tombaugh region to honour the ﬁnder
of Pluto. The dark area to the left of is called the Cthulhu
region; Cthulhu is a mythical demon in H.P. Lovecraft’s
horror stories (NASA)
(Fig. 8.33). They orbit Pluto counterclockwise
twice the distance of Charon. The New Horizons
probe found two more moons.
Ceres
Ceres was the ﬁrst asteroid discovered in
1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi. It is also the largest of
the main belt asteroids moving inside Jupiter’s or-
bit. Its diameter is about 1000 km, thus exceed-
ing the limit to be in the hydrostatic equilibrium.
Thus it is no more an asteroid but a dwarf planet.
The average opposition magnitude of Ceres is
7.9. Thus it can be seen with binoculars but not
with the naked eye.
Nearby images taken by a space probe show a
few highly reﬂecting spots.
Eris
In 2003 a Trans-Neptunian object was
found, initially labelled as 2003 UB313. One of
the initial nicknames was Xena according to the
heiress of a tv series. When a moon orbiting Xena
was found, it was obviously names as Gabrielle.
However, these names never became ofﬁcial. The
bigger object was given the name Eris and its
companion Dysnomia.
The size of Eris is similar to that of Pluto. The
size is, however, an estimate based on infrared ra-
diation. Yet it was big enough to be classiﬁed as
a planet if Pluto had retained its planetary status.
Now Eris is a dwarf planet. The semimajor axis
of the orbit is 97 au, orbital period 560 years and
inclination 45◦.
8.10
Minor Bodies
In addition to planets, moons orbiting the planets,
dwarf planets and other biggish objects the solar
system contains a lot of smaller objects that can
be collectively called minor bodies.
The class of minor bodies includes aster-
oids, comets, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust.
However, there is no clear distinction between the
groups. Some asteroids are cometlike, some as-
teroids coming close to the Earth may have earlier
been comets that have lost all of their volatile ma-
terial. The classiﬁcation is based more on the vi-
sual appearance and tradition than physical prop-
erties.
8.11
Asteroids
Asteroids form a large and scattered group of
Sun-orbiting bodies. The oldest and best-known
group form the main asteroid belt between Mars
and Jupiter, with distances of 2.2–3.3 au from the
Sun (Fig. 8.38). The most distant asteroids are far

Spacecraft images shows its spherical shape, and so it be-
came a dwarf planet. Middle: Vesta is clearly nonspheri-
cal and has remained as a minor body. It is the brightest
asteroid: at opposition under ideal conditions it could be
seen even with the naked eye. Bottom: The asteroid (243)
Ida and a small moon Dactyl orbiting the asteroid. The ir-
regular shape is typical for most asteroids. Ida is the ﬁrst
asteroid known to have a satellite
beyond the orbit of Pluto, called Trans-Neptunian
objects. There are also a number of asteroids that
come closer to the Sun than the Earth.
Earlier asteroids were called minor planets or
even planetoids. These names were actually more
natural than asteroid that only means that the ob-
ject looks a starlike dot, although it has nothing
to do with stars.
The ﬁrst asteroid was found in 1801 (Ceres,
now a dwarf planet), and at the beginning of
2016 there were more than 750,000 catalogued
and 15,000 named asteroids. There were also a
huge number of asteroids with an approximate or-
bit. The number of catalogued asteroids increases
currently by thousands every month. It has been
estimated that more than about half a million as-
teroids larger than 1 km exist in the Solar Sys-
tem. Diameters of asteroids vary from hundreds
of meters to hundreds of kilometers. The largest
asteroid Ceres is classiﬁed as a dwarf planet and
the border between smallest asteroids and mete-
oroids is not speciﬁed.
An asteroid observer needs a telescope, since
even the brightest asteroids are too faint to be
seen with the naked eye. Asteroids are points of
light like a star, even if seen through a large tele-
scope; only their slow motion against the stellar
background reveals that they are members of the
solar system.
The rotation of an asteroid gives rise to a reg-
ular light variation. The amplitude of light varia-
tion is in most cases well below 1 magnitude and
typical rotation periods range from 4 to 15 hours.
The characteristics of the main belt asteroids
are best known. Total mass of the main belt as-
teroids is less than 1/1000 of the mass of the
Earth. The centre of the asteroid belt is at a dis-
tance of approximately 2.8 au, as predicted by the
Titius–Bode law (Sect. 7.11). According to a for-
merly popular theory, asteroids were thought to
be debris from the explosion of a planet. This the-
ory, like catastrophe theories in general, has been
abandoned.
The currently accepted theory assumes that as-
teroids were formed simultaneously with the ma-
jor planets. The primeval asteroids were large
chunks, most of them orbiting between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter. Due to mutual collisions and

Fig. 8.36 Left: Asteroid (951) Gaspra was photographed
by the Galileo spacecraft in October 1991. The illumi-
nated part of the asteroid is about 16×12 km. The smallest
craters in this view are about 300 m across. Right: A mo-
saic of asteroid (433) Eros was taken by the NEAR space-
craft from a distance of 200 km. The crater on top is about

Fig. 8.37 Quasimoons or pseudomoons are asteroid
moving on rather peculiar orbits. They are not real moons,
since they orbit the Sun, but the orbital period is very close
to that of some planet. Thus the asteroid seems to oscillate
around the planet. A quasimoon moves on an eccentric or-
bit inside and outside the orbit of the planet. Eventually the
asteroid will drift away from the planet but will return after
a long time. Venus and Neptune each have one quasimoon
and the Earth has several. The orbits of the quasimoons
have been studied e.g. Seppo Mikkola in Finland and the
Canadians Kimmo Innanen and Paul Wiegert
fragmentation, the present asteroids are debris of
those primordial bodies which were never able to
form a large planet. Some of the biggest aster-
oids may be those original bodies. The orbital el-
ements of some asteroids are very similar. These
are called the Hirayama families. They are proba-
bly remnants of a single, large body that was bro-
ken into a group of smaller asteroids. There are
tens of identiﬁed Hirayama families, the largest
ones including Hungarias, Floras, Eos, Themis,
and Hildas (named after the main asteroid in the
group).
The distribution of asteroids inside the aster-
oid belt is uneven (Fig. 8.38); they seem to avoid
some areas known as the Kirkwood gaps. The
most prominent void areas are at distances where
the orbital period of an asteroid around the Sun
(given by Kepler’s third law) is in the ratio 1:3,
2:5, 3:7, or 1:2 to the orbital period of Jupiter.
The motion of an asteroid orbiting in such a gap
would be in resonance with Jupiter, and even
small perturbations would tend to grow with time.
The body would eventually be moved to another
orbit. However, the resonance effects are not so
simple: sometimes an orbit is “locked” to a reso-

(b) The total number of
asteroids as a function of
the distance from the Sun.
Each bin corresponds to
0.1 AU. The empty areas,
the Kirkwood gaps, are at
those points, where the
orbital period of an asteroid
is in a simple ratio to the
orbital period of Jupiter
nance, e.g. the Trojans move along the same orbit
as Jupiter (1:1 resonance), and the Hilda group is
in the 2:3 resonance.
Many groups of asteroids orbit the Sun outside
the main belt. These include the above-mentioned
Trojans, which orbit 60◦behind and ahead of
Jupiter. The Trojans, which are close to the spe-
cial points L4 and L5 of the solution of the re-
stricted three-body problem. At these Lagrangian
points, a massless body can remain stationary
with respect to the massive primaries (in this case,
Jupiter and the Sun). In fact, the asteroids are
oscillating around the stationary points, but the
mean orbits can be shown to be stable against per-
turbations.
Another large family is the Apollo-Amor as-
teroids. The perihelia of Apollo and Amor are in-
side the Earth’s orbit and between the orbits of the
Earth and Mars, respectively. These asteroids are
all small, less than 30 km in diameter. The most
famous is 433 Eros (Fig. 8.36), which was used in
the early 20th century for determining the length
of the astronomical unit. When closest to the
Earth, Eros is at a distance of only 20 million km
and the distance can be directly measured using
the trigonometric parallax. Some of the Apollo-
Amor asteroids could be remnants of short-period
comets that have lost all their volatile elements.
There is a marginal probability that some
Earth-crossing asteroids will collide with the
Earth. It has been estimated that, on the average,
a collision of a large asteroid causing a global
catastrophe may take place once in one million
years. Collisions of smaller bodies, causing dam-

age similar to a nuclear bomb, may happen once
per century. It has been estimated that there are
500–1000 near-Earth asteroids larger than one
kilometre in diameter but possibly tens of thou-
sands smaller objects. Programs have been started
to detect and catalogue all near-Earth asteroids
and to predict the probabilities of hazardous col-
lisions.
Distant asteroids form the third large group
outside the main asteroid belt. The ﬁrst asteroid
belonging to this group (2060) Chiron, was dis-
covered in 1977. Chiron’s aphelion is close to the
orbit of Uranus and the perihelion is slightly in-
side the orbit of Saturn. Distant asteroids are very
faint and thus difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
Already in the 1950’s Gerard Kuiper sug-
gested that comet-like debris from the formation
of the solar system can exist beyond the orbit of
Neptune as an additional source of comets to the
more distant Oort cloud. Later, computer simula-
tions of the solar system’s formation showed that
a disk of debris should form at the outer edge of
the solar system. The disk is now known as the
Kuiper belt (Fig. 8.39).
The ﬁrst Trans-Neptunian asteroid (1992 QB1)
was discovered in 1992, and in the beginning of
year 2006 there were about 1000 known mem-
bers. The total number of Kuiper belt objects
larger than 100 km in diameter is estimated to
be over 70,000. Some of them may be even larger
than Pluto. The Kuiper belt objects are remnants
from the early accretion phases of the solar sys-
tem. Several of the Trans-Neptunian objects are
in or near a 3:2 orbital period resonance with
Neptune, the same resonance as Pluto. Therefore
they are called plutinos.
The exact sizes of asteroids were long un-
known. Edward E. Barnard of the Lick Ob-
servatory determined visually the diameters of
(1) Ceres, (2) Vesta, (3) Juno, and (4) Pallas in
the 1890’s (Fig. 8.39). Practically no other re-
liable results existed prior to the 1960’s, when
indirect methods applying photometry and spec-
troscopy were adopted. Moreover, several stellar
occultations caused by asteroids have been ob-
served since 1980’s.
The ﬁrst images of asteroids were obtained in
the early 1990’s. In 1991 the Galileo spacecraft
passed asteroid (951) Gaspra, and in 1993 as-
teroid (243) Ida, on its long way to Jupiter (see
Sect. 8.15). Finally, in 2001, the NEAR space-

craft landed on asteroid (433) Eros after orbiting
it for one year.
The images of asteroids (Fig. 8.35) show ir-
regular, crater-ﬁlled bodies with regolith and pul-
verised rock on their surface. Some asteroids may
once have been two separate objects that merged
into one. In 1992 asteroid (4179) Toutatis passed
the Earth only by 4 million kilometres. Radar im-
ages revealed a two-body system, where the com-
ponents were touching each other. Double aster-
oids may be quite common, and there exist light
curves of some asteroids which have been inter-
preted as results of twin bodies. Another example
of a twin asteroid is 243 Ida that has a “moon”,
a smaller body gravitationally bound to it.
The composition of main belt asteroids is sim-
ilar to that of iron, stone and iron-stone mete-
orites. Most asteroids can be divided into three
groups, according to their photometric and po-
larimetric properties. 95 % of the classiﬁed aster-
oids belong to the types C and S types. Metal-rich
M type asteroids are rarer.
About 75 percent of asteroids belong to the
type C type. The C asteroids are dark due to
radiation darkening (geometric albedo p ≈0.06
or less), and they contain a considerable amount
of carbon (mnemonic C for carbon). They re-
semble stony meteorites. The material is undif-
ferentiated and thus they belong to the most pri-
mordial bodies of the solar system. The reﬂec-
tivity of silicate-rich S asteroids is higher and
their spectra are close to those of stone-iron me-
teorites. Their spectra show signs of silicates,
such as olivine, e.g. fosterite Mg2SiO4 or fay-
alite Fe2SiO4. M type asteroids have more met-
als, mostly nickel and iron; they have undergone
at least a partial differentiation.
The compositions and even sizes of the Trans-
Neptunian objects are difﬁcult to determine. They
are dim, and due to their low temperature, the
black-body radiation maximum is around 60 µm.
This wavelength is almost impossible to observe
on the Earth. Even the estimations of the albedos,
and therefore the diameter are very uncertain.
Colours of TNOs range from blue-grey to red
and the distribution appears to be uniform. How-
ever, population of the low-inclination objects
seem to be red and high-inclination objects blue.
The unperturbed orbits of the low-inclination ob-
jects suggest that they represent a relic of the
original population of the Kuiper belt.
Interpretations of the spectra are ambiguous
and spectra may not describe the composition of
the whole object. The surface is altered by in-
tense radiation, solar wind and micrometeorites
and it can be quite different from the regolith and
deeper layers underneath.
Small TNOs are probably mixtures of rock
and ice with some organic surface material. The
composition is similar to the comets. High den-
sity (2000–3000 kg m−3) of some large objects
suggests a high non-ice content, similar to Pluto.

Comets
Comets are agglomerates of ice, snow, and dust;
a typical diameter is of the order of 10 km or less.
The nucleus contains icy chunks and frozen gases
with embedded rock and dust. At its centre, there
can be a small, rocky core.
Comets are the only celestial objects named
after their ﬁnders. The letter P (periodic) preced-
ing some names indicates that planetary perturba-
tions have changed the orbit so that the comet has
remained orbiting the Sun.

Objects of the Solar System
A comet is invisible when far from the Sun;
when it gets closer than about 2 au, the heat of
the Sun starts to melt the ice and snow. The out-
ﬂowing gas and dust form an envelope, the coma
around the nucleus. Radiation pressure and the
solar wind push ionised gas and dust away from
the Sun, resulting in the typical long-tailed shape
of a comet (Fig. 8.42).
The tail is always pointing away from the Sun,
a fact which was noticed in the 16th century. Usu-
ally, there are two tails, an ion tail (gas tail) and
a dust tail. The partly ionised gas and very ﬁne
dust in the ion tail are driven by the solar wind.
Some of the light is reﬂected solar light, but the
brightness of the ion tail is mostly due to emis-
sion by the excited atoms. The dust tail is caused
by the radiation pressure. Because the velocities
of the particles of the dust tail are lower than the
velocities in the ion tail, the dust tail is often more
curved than the ion tail.
Fred Whipple introduced in 1950’s a “dirty
snowball” theory to describe the cometary struc-
ture. According to this model, cometary nuclei

cleus of comet P/Halley taken by ESA Giotto spacecraft in
1986. The size of the nucleus is approximately 13 × 7 km.
Dust jets are originating from two regions on the nucleus.
(ESA/Max Planck Institut für Aeronomie)
are composed of ice mixed with gravel and dust.
The observations have revealed that the classi-
cal dirty snowball model is not quite accurate;
at least the surface is more dirt than snow, also
containing organic compounds. Several chemical
compounds have been observed, including water
ice, which probably makes up 75–80 % of the
volatile material. Other common compounds are
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2),
methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and formalde-
hyde (H2CO).
The most famous (and also best known) pe-
riodic comet is Halley’s comet (Fig. 8.42). Its or-
bital period is about 76 years; it was last in perihe-
lion in 1986. During the last apparition, the comet
was also observed by spacecraft, revealing the
solid cometary body itself for the ﬁrst time. Hal-
ley is a 13 × 7 km, peanut-shaped chunk whose
surface is covered by an extremely black layer of
a possibly tar-like organic or other similar mate-
rial. Violent outbursts of gas and dust make an ex-
act prediction of its brightness impossible, as of-
ten noticed when cometary magnitudes have been
predicted. Near the perihelion, several tons of gas
and dust burst out every second.
Cometary material is very loose. Ablation of
gas and dust, large temperature variations and
tidal forces sometimes cause the whole comet to
break apart. Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 which im-
pacted into Jupiter in 1994 was torn apart two
years earlier when it passed Jupiter at a dis-
tance of 21,000 km (Fig. 8.44). The impact of
Shoemaker–Levy 9 showed that there can be den-
sity variation (and perhaps variation in composi-
tion, too) inside the original cometary body.
Comets are rather ephemeral things, surviving
only a few thousand revolutions around the Sun
or less. The short-period comets are all newcom-
ers and can survive only a short time here, in the
central part of the solar system.
Since comets in the central solar system are
rapidly destroyed, there has to be some source
of new short-period comets. In 1950 Jan Oort
discovered a strong peak for aphelia of long pe-
riod comets at a distance of about 50,000 au, and
that there is no preferential direction from which
comets come (Fig. 8.43). He proposed that there
is a vast cloud of comets at the outer reaches of

tailed closeup images. (ESA)
the solar system, now know as the Oort cloud
(Fig. 8.45). The total mass of the Oort cloud is
estimated to be tens of Earth masses, containing
more than 1012 comets.
A year later Gerard Kuiper showed that there
is a separate population of comets. Many of
the short period comets, with periods less than
200 years, have the orbital inclination less than
40◦, and they orbit the Sun in the same direction
as the Earth. The orbital inclination of long period
comets are not peaked around the plane of the
ecliptic but they are more random. Kuiper argued
that the short period comets originate from a sep-
arate population of comets that resides in a disk-
like cloud beyond the orbit of Neptune. The area
is now known as the Kuiper belt (Fig. 8.39).
Occasionally perturbations from passing stars
send some of the comets in the Oort cloud into or-
bits, which bring them into the central parts of the
solar system, where they are seen as long-period
comets. Around a dozen “new” comets are dis-
covered each year. Most of these are visible only
with a telescope, and only a couple of times per
decade one can see a bright naked-eye comet.

222
8
Objects of the Solar System
Some of the long period comets are put into
short period orbits by the perturbations of Jupiter
and Saturn, whereas some others can be ejected
from the solar system. However, there are no
comets that have been proven to come from inter-
stellar space, and the relative abundances of sev-
eral isotopes in the cometary matter are the same
as in other bodies of our solar system.
The origin of the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt
is different. The Oort cloud objects were formed
near the giant planets and have been ejected to
the outer edge of the solar system by gravitational
perturbations soon after the formation of the solar
system. Small objects beyond the orbit of Nep-
Fig. 8.43 Orbits of short period comets projected to the
plane of the ecliptic
tune had no such interactions and they remained
near the accretion disk.
In 2014 ESA’s Rosetta probe settled on an or-
bit around the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko
and sent the Philae lander to its surface. The lan-
der found several organic compounds and hard
ice below a dust layer about 20 centimetres thick.
The water vapour emanating from the comet was
different from the terrestrial water: the ratio of
deuterium to ordinary hydrogen was three times
higher than on the Earth. This suggests that the
source of water on the Earth is not comets, at least
not of those like Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
8.13
Meteoroids
Solid bodies smaller than asteroids are called me-
teoroids. The boundary between asteroids and
meteoroids, however, is diffuse; it is a matter of
taste whether a ten metre body is called an as-
teroid or a meteoroid. We could say that it is an
asteroid if it has been observed so often that its
orbital elements are known.
When a meteoroid hits the atmosphere, an
optical phenomenon, called a meteor (“shooting
star”) is seen (Fig. 8.47). The smallest bodies
causing meteors have a mass of about 1 gram; the
(micro)meteoroids smaller than this do not result
in optical phenomena. However, even these can
be observed with radar which is able to detect
the column of ionised air. Micrometeoroids can

semimajor axes of long-period comets. The abscissa is
the inverse of the semimajor axis, 1/a [AU]−1. The Oort
cloud is visible as a strong peak at the very small positive
values of 1/a. The orbits shown here are the “original or-
bits”, i.e. computed backward in time to remove all known
perturbations
also be studied with particle detectors installed
in satellites and space crafts. Bright meteors are
called bolides.
The number of meteoroids increases rapidly as
their size diminishes. It has been estimated that
at least 105 kg of meteoritic material falls on the
Earth each day. Most of this material is microm-
eteoroids and causes no visible phenomena.
Due to perspective, all meteors coming from
the same direction seem to radiate from the same
point. Such meteor streams (meteor showers) are,
e.g. the Perseids in August and the Geminides in
December; the names are given according to the
constellation in which the radiation point seems
to be. On the average, one can see a few sporadic
meteors (Fig. 8.46) per hour. During a strong me-
teor shower one can see even tens of meteors per
minute, although a normal rate is some tens per
hour.
Most of the meteoroids are small and burn to
ashes at a height of 100 km. However, larger bod-
ies may come through and fall to the Earth. These
are called meteorites. The relative speed of a typi-
cal meteoroid varies in the range 10–70 km/s. The
speed of the largest bodies does not diminish in
the atmosphere; thus, they hit the Earth at their
cosmic speeds, resulting in large impact craters.
Smaller bodies slow down and drop like stones
Fig. 8.46 When the Earth is moving on its orbit, the
morning hemisphere is the leading one. Hence most of the
meteoroids coming from random directions hit the morn-
ing hemisphere. Thus most meteors can be seen between
midnight and sunrise
Fig. 8.47 Meteors are easy to capture on ﬁlm: one just
leaves a camera loaded with a sensitive ﬁlm on a tripod
with the shutter open for an hour or so. Stars make curved
trails on the ﬁlm. (L. Häkkinen)
but impacts of large bodies (diameter meters or
more) may cause large-scale disaster.
Iron meteorites or irons, composed of almost
pure nickel-iron, comprise about one quarter of
all meteorites. Actually the irons are in a minor-
ity among meteoroids, but they survive their vio-
lent voyage through the atmosphere more easily
than weaker bodies. Three-quarters are stony me-
teorites, or stone-iron meteorites.

Meteoroids themselves can be divided into
three groups of roughly equal size. One-third
is ordinary stones, chondrites. The second class
contains weaker carbonaceous chondrites and
the third class includes cometary material, loose
bodies of ice and snow which are unable to sur-
vive down to the Earth.
Many meteor streams are in the same orbit as
a known comet, so at least some meteoroids are of
cometary origin. Near a perihelion passage, every
second several tons of gravel is left on the orbit of
a comet. There are several examples of meteorites
that have their origin in the Moon or Mars. De-
bris of large impacts may have been ejected into
space and ﬁnally ended up on the Earth. Some
meteoroids are debris of asteroids.
8.14
Interplanetary Dust and Other
Particles
Two faint light phenomena, namely zodiacal light
and gegenschein (counterglow) make it possible
to observe interplanetary dust, small dust parti-
cles reﬂecting the light of the Sun. This weak
glow can be seen above the rising or setting
Sun (zodiacal light) or exactly opposite the Sun
(gegenschein). The interplanetary dust is concen-
trated near the plane of the ecliptic. The typ-
ical sizes of the particles are in the range of
10–100 µm.
Solar Wind
Elementary particles hitting the
Earth originate both in the Sun and outside the
solar system. Charged particles, mainly protons,
electrons and alpha particles (helium nuclei) ﬂow
continuously out of the Sun. At the distance of
the Earth, the average speed of this solar wind is
about 500 km/s. The velocity and number of par-
ticles depend on eruptions and activity of the Sun
(Sects. 13.3 and 13.4).
The charged particles interact with the solar
magnetic ﬁeld. The strength of the solar magnetic
ﬁeld at the Earth’s distance is about 1/1000 of
that of the Earth. Particles coming from outside
the solar system are called cosmic rays, which
contain both elementary particles and heavier nu-
clei.

Examples
Example 8.1 (The Roche Limit) A French math-
ematician Edouard Roche computed in 1848
a limit where a moon will be torn apart due to
the tidal forces if it approaches its parent planet.
Roche proposed that the Saturnian rings were
formed in that way.
We can compute the Roche limit for a body at
a distance R of a planet the mass of which is M
approximating the body with two small spheres
of radius r and mass m. The difference of grav-
itation affecting the small spheres by the planet

and assuming that the densities ρ are equal, m =

R ≈2.5 × S.
Our result is valid only for a body without any
internal strength. Smaller bodies with internal
strength can survive inside the Roche limit. You,
dear reader, act as an excellent example of this,
because you read this example well inside the
Roche limit of the Earth. A 100 km stony asteroid
will survive even if it orbits the Earth just above
the atmosphere but a sphere of water of the same
size would break apart.

Stellar Spectra
All our information about the physical proper-
ties of stars comes more or less directly from
studies of their spectra. In particular, by study-
ing the strength of various absorption lines, stel-
lar masses, temperatures and compositions can be
deduced. The line shapes contain detailed infor-
mation about atmospheric processes.
As we have seen in Chap. 3, the light of a star
can be dispersed into a spectrum by means of
a prism or a diffraction grating. The distribution
of the energy ﬂux density over frequency can then
be derived. The spectra of stars consist of a con-
tinuous spectrum or continuum with narrow spec-
tral lines superimposed (Fig. 9.1). The lines in
stellar spectra are mostly dark absorption lines,
but in some objects bright emission lines also oc-
cur.
In a very simpliﬁed way the continuous spec-
trum can be thought of as coming from the hot
surface of the star. Atoms in the atmosphere
above the surface absorb certain characteristic
wavelengths of this radiation, leaving dark “gaps”
at the corresponding points in the spectrum. In
reality there is no such sharp separation between
surface and atmosphere. All layers emit and ab-
sorb radiation, but the net result of these pro-
cesses is that less energy is radiated at the wave-
lengths of the absorption lines.
The spectra of stars are classiﬁed on the ba-
sis of the strengths of the spectral lines. Isaac
Newton observed the solar spectrum in 1666, but,
properly speaking, spectroscopy began in 1814
when Joseph Fraunhofer observed the dark lines
in the spectrum of the Sun. He assigned capi-
tal letters, like D, G, H and K, to some of the
stronger dark lines without knowing the elements
responsible for the origin of the lines (Sect. 9.2).
The absorption lines are also known as Fraun-
hofer lines. In 1860, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and
Robert Bunsen identiﬁed the lines as the charac-
teristic lines produced by various elements in an
incandescent gas.
9.1
Measuring Spectra
The most important methods of forming a spec-
trum are by means of an objective prism or a slit
spectrograph. In the former case one obtains
a photograph, where each stellar image has been
spread into a spectrum. Up to several hundred
spectra can be photographed on a single plate
and used for spectral classiﬁcation. The amount
of detail that can be seen in a spectrum depends
on its dispersion, the range of wavelengths per
millimetre on the plate (or per pixel on a CCD).
The dispersion of an objective prism is a few
tens of nanometres per millimetre. More detailed
observations require a slit spectrograph, which
can reach a dispersion 1–0.01 nm/mm. The de-
tailed shape of individual spectral lines can then
be studied.
The photograph of the spectrum is converted
to an intensity tracing showing the ﬂux density as
a function of wavelength. This is done by means
of a microdensitometer, measuring the amount of
light transmitted by the recorded spectrum. Since
the blackening of a photographic plate is not lin-
early related to the amount of energy it has re-

Stellar Spectra
Fig. 9.1 A typical stellar spectrum. The continuous spec-
trum is brightest at about 550 nm and gets fainter towards
shorter and longer wavelengths. Dark absorption lines are

η Pegasi, is very similar to that of our Sun. (Mt. Wilson
Observatory)

Crimean Observatory. (b) A more extensive part of the

H. Virtanen, Helsinki Observatory)
ceived, the measured blackening has to be cali-
brated by comparison with known exposures.
Nowadays CCD cameras are used also in spec-
trographs and the intensity curve is determined
directly without the intervening step of a pho-
tographic plate. Some image processing is still
needed since the height of the spectrum is sev-
eral pixels and the spectrum may not be aligned
with the pixel rows of the camera.
For measurements of line strengths the spec-
trum is usually rectiﬁed by dividing by the con-
tinuum intensity. Figure 9.2 shows a photograph
of the spectrum of a star and the intensity curve
obtained from a calibrated and rectiﬁed micro-
densitometer tracing. The second pair of pic-
tures shows the intensity curve before and after
the normalisation. The absorption lines appear as
troughs of various sizes in the curve. In addition
to the clear and deep lines, there are large num-
bers of weaker lines that can barely be discerned.
The graininess of the photographic emulsion is
a source of noise which appears as irregular ﬂuc-
tuations of the intensity curve. Some lines are so
close together that they appear blended at this dis-
persion.
The detailed shape of a spectral line is called
the line proﬁle (Sect. 5.3). The true shape of the
line reﬂects the properties of the stellar atmo-

sphere, but the observed proﬁle is also spread out
by the measuring instrument. However, the total
absorption in the line, usually expressed in terms
of the equivalent width, is less sensitive to obser-
vational effects (see Fig. 5.6).
The equivalent width of a spectral line de-
pends on how many atoms in the atmosphere are
in a state in which they can absorb the wave-
length in question. The more atoms there are, the
stronger and broader the spectral line is. For ex-
ample, a typical equivalent width of a metal line
(Fe) in the solar spectrum is about 10 pm. Line
widths are often expressed in ångströms (1 Å =
10−10 m = 0.1 nm).
Only in weak lines the equivalent width de-
pends linearly on the number of absorbing atoms.
The equivalent width as a function of the amount
of absorbing atoms is known as the curve of
growth. It is, however, beyond the scope of this
book.
Line proﬁles are also broadened by the Dopp-
ler effect. In stellar atmospheres there are motions
of small and large scale, like thermal motion of
the atoms and convective ﬂows.
The chemical composition of the atmosphere
can be determined from the strengths of the spec-
tral lines. With the introduction of large com-
puters it has become feasible to construct quite
detailed models of the structure of stellar atmo-
spheres, and to compute the emergent spectrum
for a given model. The computed synthetic spec-
trum can be compared with the observations and
the theoretical model modiﬁed until a good ﬁt
is obtained. The theoretical models then give the
number of absorbing atoms, and hence the ele-
ment abundances, in the atmosphere. The con-
struction of model atmospheres will be discussed
in Sect. 9.6.
9.2
The Harvard Spectral
Classiﬁcation
The spectral classiﬁcation scheme in present use
was developed at Harvard Observatory in the
United States in the early 20th century. The work
was begun by Henry Draper who in 1872 took
the ﬁrst photograph of the spectrum of Vega.
Later Draper’s widow donated the observing
equipment and a sum of money to Harvard Ob-
servatory to continue the work of classiﬁcation.
The main part of the classiﬁcation was done by
Annie Jump Cannon using objective prism spec-
tra. The Henry Draper Catalogue (HD) was pub-
lished in 1918–1924. It contains 225,000 stars ex-
tending down to 9 magnitudes. Altogether more
than 390,000 stars were classiﬁed at Harvard.
The Harvard classiﬁcation is based on lines
that are mainly sensitive to the stellar tempera-
ture, rather than to gravity or luminosity. Impor-
tant lines are the hydrogen Balmer lines, the lines
of neutral helium, the iron lines, the H and K dou-
blet of ionised calcium at 396.8 and 393.3 nm,
the G band due to the CH molecule and some
metals around 431 nm, the neutral calcium line at
422.7 nm and the lines of titanium oxide (TiO).
The main types in the Harvard classiﬁcation
are denoted by capital letters. They were ini-
tially ordered in alphabetical sequence, but subse-
quently it was noticed that they could be ordered
according to temperature. With the temperature
decreasing towards the right the sequence is
C
O–B–A–F–G–K–M–L–T.
S
Additional notations are Q for novae, P for plan-
etary nebulae and W for Wolf–Rayet stars. The
class C consists of the earlier types R and N.
The spectral classes C and S represent parallel
branches to types G–M, differing in their surface
chemical composition. The most recent addition
are the spectral classes L and T continuing the
sequence beyond M, representing brown dwarfs.
There is a well-known mnemonic for the spectral
classes, but due to its chauvinistic tone we refuse
to tell it.
The spectral classes are divided into sub-
classes denoted by the numbers 0,...,9; some-
times decimals are used, e.g. B 0.5 (Figs. 9.3
and 9.4).
Classes at the beginning of the sequence are
sometimes called early classes and those at the
end of the sequence late classes. This is no way
related to stellar evolution; it only reﬂects the po-
sition in the sequence O–B–A–F–G–K–M.

The main characteristics of the classiﬁcation
scheme can be seen in Fig. 9.5 showing the vari-
ations of some typical absorption lines in the dif-
ferent spectral classes. Different spectral features
are mainly due to different effective temperatures.
Different pressures and chemical compositions of
stellar atmospheres are not very important factors
in the spectral classiﬁcation, except in some pe-
culiar stars.
The early, i.e. hot, spectral classes are char-
acterised by the lines of ionised atoms, whereas
the cool, or late, spectral types have lines of neu-
tral atoms. In hot stars molecules dissociate into
atoms; thus the absorption bands of molecules ap-
pear only in the spectra of cool stars of late spec-
tral types.
To see how the strengths of the spectral lines
are determined by the temperature, we consider,

for example, the neutral helium lines at 402.6 nm
and 447.2 nm. These are only seen in the spec-
tra of hot stars. The reason for this is that the
lines are due to absorption by excited atoms,
and that a high temperature is required to pro-
duce any appreciable excitation. As the stellar
temperature increases, more atoms are in the re-
quired excited state, and the strength of the he-

lium lines increases. When the temperature be-
comes even higher, helium begins to be ionised,
and the strength of the neutral helium lines be-
gins to decrease. In a similar way one can under-
stand the variation with temperature of other im-
portant lines, such as the calcium H and K lines.
These lines are due to singly ionised calcium, and
the temperature must be just right to remove one
electron but no more.
The hydrogen Balmer lines Hβ, Hγ and Hδ are
strongest in the spectral class A2. These lines cor-
respond to transitions to the level the principal
quantum number of which is n = 2. If the tem-
perature is too high the hydrogen is ionised and
such transitions are not possible.
9.3
The Yerkes Spectral
Classiﬁcation
The Harvard classiﬁcation only takes into ac-
count the effect of the temperature on the spec-
trum. For a more precise classiﬁcation, one also
has to take into account the luminosity of the star,
since two stars with the same effective tempera-
ture may have widely different luminosities.
A two-dimensional system of spectral classi-
ﬁcation was introduced by William W. Morgan,
Philip C. Keenan and Edith Kellman of Yerkes
Observatory. This system is known as the MKK
or Yerkes classiﬁcation. (The MK classiﬁcation is
a modiﬁed, later version.) The MKK classiﬁca-
tion is based on the visual scrutiny of slit spec-
tra with a dispersion of 11.5 nm/mm. It is care-
fully deﬁned on the basis of standard stars and the
speciﬁcation of luminosity criteria. Six different
luminosity classes are distinguished:
– Ia most luminous supergiants,
– Ib less luminous supergiants,
– II luminous giants,
– III normal giants,
– IV subgiants,
– V main sequence stars (dwarfs).
The luminosity class is denoted by a Roman
numeral after the spectral class. For example, the
class of the Sun is G2 V.
The luminosity class is determined from spec-
tral lines that depend strongly on the stellar sur-
face gravity, which is closely related to the lu-
minosity. The masses of giants and dwarfs are
roughly similar, but the radii of giants are much
larger than those of dwarfs. Therefore the grav-
itational acceleration g = GM/R2 at the surface
of a giant is much smaller than for a dwarf. In
consequence, the gas density and pressure in the
atmosphere of a giant is much smaller. This gives
rise to luminosity effects in the stellar spectrum,
which can be used to distinguish between stars of
different luminosities.
1. For spectral types B–F, the lines of neutral hy-
drogen are deeper and narrower for stars of
higher luminosities. The reason for this is that
the metal ions give rise to a ﬂuctuating elec-
tric ﬁeld near the hydrogen atoms. This ﬁeld
leads to shifts in the hydrogen energy levels
(the Stark effect), appearing as a broadening
of the lines. The effect becomes stronger as
the density increases. Thus the hydrogen lines

line is very weak,

where the line is very
broad. [Aller, L.H. (1953):
Astrophysics. The
Atmospheres of the Sun
and Stars (The Ronald
Press Company, New York)
p. 318]
are narrow in absolutely bright stars, and be-
come broader in main sequence stars and even
more so in white dwarfs (Fig. 9.6).
2. The lines from ionised elements are relatively
stronger in high-luminosity stars. This is be-
cause the higher density makes it easier for
electrons and ions to recombine to neutral
atoms. On the other hand, the rate of ionisa-
tion is essentially determined by the radiation
ﬁeld, and is not appreciably affected by the gas
density. Thus a given radiation ﬁeld can main-
tain a higher degree of ionisation in stars with
more extended atmospheres. For example, in
the spectral classes F–G, the relative strengths
of the ionised strontium (Sr II) and neutral iron
(Fe I) lines can be used as a luminosity indica-
tor. Both lines depend on the temperature in
roughly the same way, but the Sr II lines be-
come relatively much stronger as the luminos-
ity increases.
3. Giant stars are redder than dwarfs of the same
spectral type. The spectral type is determined
from the strengths of spectral lines, including
ion lines. Since these are stronger in giants,
a giant will be cooler, and thus also redder,
than a dwarf of the same spectral type.
4. There is a strong cyanogen (CN) absorption
band in the spectra of giant stars, which is al-
most totally absent in dwarfs. This is partly
a temperature effect, since the cooler atmo-
spheres of giants are more suitable for the for-
mation of cyanogen.

9.4
Peculiar Spectra
The spectra of some stars differ from what one
would expect on the basis of their temperature
and luminosity (see, e.g., Fig. 9.7). Such stars are
celled peculiar. The most common peculiar spec-
tral types will now be considered.
The Wolf–Rayet stars are very hot stars; the
ﬁrst examples were discovered by Charles Wolf
and Georges Rayet in 1867. The spectra of Wolf–
Rayet stars have broad emission lines of hydro-
gen and ionised helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen. There are hardly any absorption lines.
The Wolf–Rayet stars are thought to be very
massive stars that have lost their outer layers in
a strong stellar wind. This has exposed the stellar
interior, which gives rise to a different spectrum
than the normal outer layers. Many Wolf–Rayet
stars are members of binary systems.
In some O and B stars the hydrogen absorp-
tion lines have weak emission components ei-
ther at the line centre or in its wings. These stars
are called Be and shell stars (the letter e after
the spectral type indicates that there are emis-
sion lines in the spectrum). The emission lines
are formed in a rotationally ﬂattened gas shell
around the star. The shell and Be stars show ir-
regular variations, apparently related to structural
changes in the shell. About 15 % of all O and
B stars have emission lines in their spectra.
The strongest emission lines are those of the
P Cygni stars, which have one or more sharp ab-
sorption lines on the short wavelength side of
the emission line. It is thought that the lines
are formed in a thick expanding envelope. The
P Cygni stars are often variable. For example,
P Cygni itself has varied between three and six
magnitudes during the past centuries. At present
its magnitude is about 5.
The peculiar A stars or Ap stars (p = peculiar)
are usually strongly magnetic stars, where the
lines are split into several components by the
Zeeman effect. The lines of certain elements,
such as magnesium, silicon, europium, chromium
and strontium, are exceptionally strong in the Ap
stars. Lines of rarer elements such as mercury,
gallium or krypton may also be present. Other-
wise, the Ap stars are like normal main sequence
stars.
The Am stars (m = metallic) also have anoma-
lous element abundances, but not to the same ex-
tent as the Ap stars. The lines of e.g. the rare
earths and the heaviest elements are strong in
their spectra; those of calcium and scandium are
weak.
We have already mentioned the S and C stars,
which are special classes of K and M giants with
anomalous element abundances. In the S stars,
the normal lines of titanium, scandium and vana-
dium oxide are replaced with oxides of heavier

Fig. 9.8 The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The horizon-
tal coordinate can be either the colour index B −V , ob-
tained directly from observations, or the spectral class. In
theoretical studies the effective temperature Te is com-
monly used. These correspond to each other but the depen-
dence varies somewhat with luminosity. The vertical axis
gives the absolute magnitude. In a (lg(L/L⊙),lgTe) plot
the curves of constant radius are straight lines. The dens-
est areas are the main sequence and the horizontal, red gi-
ant and asymptotic branches consisting of giant stars. The
supergiants are scattered above the giants. To the lower
left are some white dwarfs about 10 magnitudes below the
main sequence. The apparently brightest stars (m < 4) are
marked with crosses and the nearest stars (r < 50 ly) with
dots. The data are from the Hipparcos catalogue
elements, zirconium, yttrium and barium. A large
fraction of the S stars are irregular variables. The
name of the C stars refers to carbon. The metal
oxide lines are almost completely absent in their
spectra; instead, various carbon compounds (CN,
C2, CH) are strong. The abundance of carbon rel-
ative to oxygen is 4–5 times greater in the C stars
than in normal stars. The C stars are divided into
two groups, hotter R stars and cooler N stars.
Another type of giant stars with abundance
anomalies are the barium stars. The lines of bar-
ium, strontium, rare earths and some carbon com-
pounds are strong in their spectra. Apparently nu-
clear reaction products have been mixed up to the
surface in these stars.
9.5
The Hertzsprung–Russell
Diagram
Around 1910, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Nor-
ris Russell studied the relation between the abso-
lute magnitudes and the spectral types of stars.
The diagram showing these two variables is now
known as the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or
simply the HR diagram (Fig. 9.8). It has turned
out to be an important aid in studies of stellar evo-
lution.
In view of the fact that stellar radii, luminosi-
ties and surface temperatures vary widely, one
might have expected the stars to be uniformly dis-
tributed in the HR diagram. However, it is found

236
9
Stellar Spectra
that most stars are located along a roughly diag-
onal curve called the main sequence. The Sun is
situated about the middle of the main sequence.
The HR diagram also shows that the yellow
and red stars (spectral types G–K–M) are clus-
tered into two clearly separate groups: the main
sequence of dwarf stars and the giants. The gi-
ant stars fall into several distinct groups. The
horizontal branch is an almost horizontal se-
quence, about absolute visual magnitude zero.
The red giant branch rises almost vertically from
the main sequence at spectral types K and M in
the HR diagram. Finally, the asymptotic branch
rises from the horizontal branch and approaches
the bright end of the red giant branch. These var-
ious branches represent different phases of stellar
evolution (cf. Sects. 12.3 and 12.4): dense areas
correspond to evolutionary stages in which stars
stay a long time.
A typical horizontal branch giant is about
a hundred times brighter than the Sun. Since gi-
ants and dwarfs of the same spectral class have
nearly the same surface temperature, the differ-
ence in luminosity must be due to a difference in
radius according to (5.21). For example Arcturus,
which is one of the brightest stars in the sky, has
a radius about thirty times that of the Sun.
The brightest red giants are the supergiants
with magnitudes up to MV = −7. One example
is Betelgeuze. in Orion, with a radius of 400 so-
lar radii and 20,000 times more luminous than the
Sun.
About 10 magnitudes below the main se-
quence are the white dwarfs. They are quite nu-
merous in space, but faint and difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
The best-known example is Sirius B, the com-
panion of Sirius.
There are some stars in the HR diagram
which are located below the giant branch, but
still clearly above the main sequence. These are
known as subgiants. Similarly, there are stars
below the main sequence, but brighter than the
white dwarfs, known as subdwarfs.
When interpreting the HR diagram, one has
to take into account selection effects: absolutely
bright stars are more likely to be included in the
sample, since they can be discovered at greater
distances. If only stars within a certain distance
from the Sun are included, the distribution of
stars in the HR diagram looks quite different. This
can be seen in Fig. 9.8: there are no giant or bright
main sequence stars among these.
The HR diagrams of star clusters are particu-
larly important for the theory of stellar evolution.
They will be discussed in Chap. 17.
9.6
Model Atmospheres
The stellar atmosphere consists of those layers of
the star where the radiation that is transmitted di-
rectly to the observer originates. Thus in order to
interpret stellar spectra, one needs to be able to
compute the structure of the atmosphere and the
emerging radiation.
In actual stars there are many factors, such as
rotation and magnetic ﬁelds, that complicate the
problem of computing the structure of the atmo-
sphere. We shall only consider the classical prob-
lem of ﬁnding the structure, i.e. the distribution of
pressure and temperature with depth, in a static,
unmagnetised atmosphere. In that case a model
atmosphere is completely speciﬁed by giving the
chemical composition, the gravitational acceler-
ation at the surface, g, and the energy ﬂux from
the stellar interior, or equivalently, the effective
temperature Te.
The basic principles involved in computing
a model stellar atmosphere are the same as for
stellar interiors and will be discussed in Chap. 11.
Essentially, there are two differential equations
to be solved: the equation of hydrostatic equilib-
rium, which ﬁxes the distribution of pressure, and
an equation of energy transport, which will have
a different form depending on whether the atmo-
sphere is radiative or convective, and which de-
termines the temperature distribution.
The values of the various physical quantities
in an atmosphere are usually given as functions of
some suitably deﬁned continuum optical depth τ.
Thus pressure, temperature, density, ionisation
and the population numbers of various energy
levels can all be obtained as functions of τ. When
these are known, the intensity of radiation emerg-
ing from the atmosphere can be computed. In
Box 9.1, it is shown that approximately the emer-
gent spectrum originates at unit optical depth,

9.7
What Do the Observations Tell Us?

measured along each light ray. On this basis, one
can predict whether a given spectral line will be
present in the spectrum.
Consider a spectral line formed when an atom
(or ion) in a given energy state absorbs a photon.
From the model atmosphere, the occupation num-
ber of the absorbing level is known as a function
of the (continuum) optical depth τ. If now there
is a layer above the depth τ = 1 where the ab-
sorbing level has a high occupancy, the optical
depth in the line will become unity before τ = 1,
i.e. the radiation in the line will originate higher
in the atmosphere. Because the temperature in-
creases inwards, the intensity in the line will cor-
respond to a lower temperature, and the line will
appear dark. On the other hand, if the absorbing
level is unoccupied, the optical depth at the line
frequency will be the same as the continuum op-
tical depth. The radiation at the line frequency
will then come from the same depth as the ad-
jacent continuum, and no absorption line will be
formed.
The expression for the intensity derived in
Box 9.1 also explains the phenomenon of limb
darkening seen in the Sun (Sect. 12.2). The radia-
tion that reaches us from near the edge of the solar
disk emerges at a very oblique angle (θ near 90◦),
i.e. cosθ is small. Thus this radiation originates at
small values of τ, and hence at low temperatures.
In consequence, the intensity coming from near
the edge will be lower, and the solar disk will ap-
pear darker towards the limb. The amount of limb
darkening also gives an empirical way of deter-
mining the temperature distribution in the solar
atmosphere.
Our presentation of stellar atmospheres has
been highly simpliﬁed. In practice, the spectrum
is computed numerically for a range of parameter
values. The values of Te and element abundances
for various stars can then be found by comparing
the observed line strengths and other spectral fea-
tures with the theoretical ones. We shall not go
into details on the procedures used.
9.7
What Do the Observations Tell
Us?
To conclude this chapter, we shall give a sum-
mary of the properties of stars revealed by the ob-
servations. At the end of the book, there are tables
of the brightest and of the nearest stars.
Of the brightest stars, four have a negative
magnitude. Some of the apparently bright stars
are absolutely bright supergiants, others are sim-
ply nearby.
In the list of the nearest stars, the dominance of
faint dwarf stars, already apparent in the HR dia-
gram, is worth noting. Most of these belong to the
spectral types K and M. Some nearby stars also
have very faint companions with masses about
that of Jupiter, i.e. planets. They have not been
included in the table.
Stellar spectroscopy offers an important way
of determining fundamental stellar parameters, in
particular mass and radius. However, the spec-
tral information needs to be calibrated by means
of direct measurements of these quantities. These
will be considered next.
The masses of stars can be determined in the
case of double stars orbiting each other. (The de-
tails of the method will be discussed in Chap. 9.)
These observations have shown that the larger
the mass of a main sequence star becomes, the
higher on the main sequence it is located. One
thus obtains an empirical mass–luminosity rela-
tion, which can be used to estimate stellar masses
on the basis of the spectral type.
The observed relation between mass and lu-
minosity is shown in Fig. 9.9. The luminosity is
roughly proportional to the power 3.8 of the mass:
L ∝M3.8.
(9.1)
The relations is only approximate. According to
it, a ten solar mass star is about 6300 times
brighter than the Sun, corresponding to 9.5 mag-
nitudes.
The smallest observed stellar masses are about
1/20 of the solar mass, corresponding to stars in
the lower right-hand part of the HR diagram. The
masses of white dwarfs are less than one solar
mass. The masses of the most massive main se-
quence and supergiant stars are between 10 and
possibly even 150M⊙.
Direct interferometric measurements of stel-
lar angular diameters have been made for only
a few dozen stars. When the distances are known,
these immediately yield the value of the radius. In

238
9
Stellar Spectra
eclipsing binaries, the radius can also be directly
measured (see Sect. 10.4). Altogether, close to
a hundred stellar radii are known from direct
measurements. In other cases, the radius must be
estimated from the absolute luminosity and effec-
tive temperature.
In discussing stellar radii, it is convenient to
use a version of the HR diagram with lgTe on the
horizontal and Mbol or lg(L/L⊙) on the vertical
axis. If the value of the radius R is ﬁxed, then
(5.21) yields a linear relation between the bolo-
metric magnitude and lgTe. Thus lines of con-
stant radius in the HR diagram are straight. Lines
corresponding to various values of the radius are
shown in Fig. 9.8. The smallest stars are the white
dwarfs with radii of about one per cent of the so-
Fig. 9.9 Mass–luminosity relation. The picture is based
on binaries with known masses. Different symbols refer
to different kinds of binaries. (From Böhm-Vitense: In-
troduction to Stellar Astrophysics, Cambridge University
Press (1989–1992))
lar radius, whereas the largest supergiants have
radii several thousand times larger than the Sun.
Not included in the ﬁgure are the compact stars
(neutron stars and black holes) with typical radii
of a few tens of kilometres.
Since the stellar radii vary so widely, so do
the densities of stars. The density of giant stars
may be only 10−4 kg/m3, whereas the density of
white dwarfs is about 109 kg/m3.
The range of values for stellar effective tem-
peratures and luminosities can be immediately
seen in the HR diagram. The range of effective
temperature is 2000–40,000 K, and that of lumi-
nosity 10−4–106 L⊙.
The rotation of stars appears as a broadening
of the spectral lines. One edge of the stellar disk
is approaching us, the other edge is receding, and
the radiation from the edges is Doppler shifted
accordingly. The rotational velocity observed in
this way is only the component along the line of
sight. The true velocity is obtained by dividing
with sini, where i is the angle between the line
of sight and the rotational axis. A star seen from
the direction of the pole will show no rotation.
Assuming the axes of rotation to be randomly
oriented, the distribution of rotational velocities
can be statistically estimated. The hottest stars
appear to rotate faster than the cooler ones. The
rotational velocity at the equator varies from
200–250 km/s for O and B stars to about 20 km/s
for spectral type G. In shell stars, the rotational
velocity may reach 500 km/s.
The chemical composition of the outer layers
is deduced from the strengths of the spectral lines.
About three-fourths of the stellar mass is hy-
drogen. Helium comprises about one-fourth, and
the abundance of other elements is very small.
The abundance of heavy elements in young stars
(about 2 %) is much larger than in old ones,
where it is less than 0.02 %.

Binary Stars and Stellar Masses
Quite often, two stars may appear to be close to-
gether in the sky, although they are really at very
different distances. Such chance pairs are called
optical binary stars. However, many close pairs
of stars really are at the same distance and form
a physical system in which two stars are orbit-
ing around each other. Less than half of all stars
are single stars like the Sun. More than 50 % be-
long to systems containing two or more members.
In general, the multiple systems have a hierarchi-
cal structure: a star and a binary orbiting around
each other in triple systems, two binaries orbit-
ing around each other in quadruple systems. Thus
most multiple systems can be described as bina-
ries with several levels.
Binaries are classiﬁed on the basis of the
method of their discovery. This classiﬁcation has
nothing to do with the physical properties of the
stars. Visual binaries can be seen as two sepa-
rate components, i.e. the separation between the
stars is larger than about 0.1 arc seconds. The rel-
ative position of the components changes over the
years as they move in their orbits (Fig. 10.1). In
astrometric binary stars only one component is
seen, but its variable proper motion shows that
a second invisible component must be present.
The spectroscopic binary stars are discovered on
the basis of their spectra. Either two sets of spec-
tral lines are seen or else the Doppler shift of the
observed lines varies periodically, indicating an
invisible companion. The fourth class of bina-
ries are the photometric binary stars or eclips-
ing variables. In these systems the components
of the pair regularly pass in front of each other,
causing a change in the total apparent magni-
tude.
Binary stars can also be classiﬁed on the ba-
sis of their mutual separation. In distant binaries
the separation between the components is tens or
hundreds of astronomical units and their orbital
periods are from tens to thousands of years. In
close binaries the separation is from about one
au down to the radius of the stars. The orbital pe-
riod ranges from a few hours to a few years. The
components of contact binaries are so close that
they are touching each other.
The stars in a binary system move in an ellipti-
cal orbit around the centre of mass of the system.
In Chap. 6 it was shown that the relative orbit, too,
is an ellipse, and thus the observations are often
described as if one component remained station-
ary and the other orbited around it.
10.1
Visual Binaries
We consider a visual binary, assuming initially
that the brighter primary component is station-
ary and the fainter secondary component is or-
biting around it. The angular separation of the
stars and the angular direction to the secondary
can be directly observed. Making use of observa-
tions extending over many years or decades, the
relative orbit of the secondary can be determined.
The ﬁrst binary orbit to be determined was that of
ξ UMa in 1830 (Fig. 10.2).
The observations of visual binaries only give
the projection of the relative orbital ellipse on the
plane of the sky. The shape and position of the

calculated if one makes use of the fact that the
primary should be located at a focal point of the
relative orbit. The deviation of the projected po-
sition of the primary from the focus of the pro-
jected relative orbit allows one to determine the
orientation of the true orbit.
The absolute size of the orbit can only be
found if the distance of the binary is known.
Knowing this, the total mass of the system can
be calculated from Kepler’s third law.
The masses of the individual components
can be determined by observing the motions of
both components relative to the centre of mass
(Fig. 10.3). Let the semimajor axes of the or-
bital ellipses of the primary and the secondary
be a1 and a2. Then, according to the deﬁnition of
the centre of mass,

For example, the masses of the components of
ξ UMa have been found to be 1.3 and 1.0 solar
masses.
10.2
Astrometric Binary Stars
In astrometric binaries, only the orbit of the
brighter component about the centre of mass can
be observed. If the mass of the visible component
is estimated, e.g. from its luminosity, the mass of
the invisible companion can also be estimated.
The ﬁrst astrometric binary was Sirius, which
in the 1830’s was observed to have an undulat-
ing proper motion. It was concluded that it had
a small companion, which was visually discov-
ered a few decades later (Figs. 10.4 and 15.1).

10.3
Spectroscopic Binaries

The companion, Sirius B, was a completely new
type of object, a white dwarf (Sect. 15.1).
The proper motions of nearby stars have been
carefully studied in the search for planetary sys-
tems. Although e.g. Barnard’s star may have un-
seen companions, the existence of planetary sys-
tems around other stars was not established by
proper motion studies but with spectroscopic ob-
servations (Sect. 21.8).
10.3
Spectroscopic Binaries
The spectroscopic binaries (Fig. 10.5) appear as
single stars in even the most powerful telescopes,
but their spectra show a regular variation. The
ﬁrst spectroscopic binary was discovered in the
1880’s, when it was found that the spectral lines
of ζ UMa or Mizar split into two at regular inter-
vals.
The Doppler shift of a spectral line is directly
proportional to the radial velocity. Thus the sep-
aration of the spectral lines is largest when one
component is directly approaching and the other
is receding from the observer. The period of the
variation is the orbital period of the stars. Unfor-
tunately, there is no general way of determining
the position of the orbit in space. The observed
velocity v is related to the true velocity v0 ac-
cording to
v = v0 sini,
(10.3)
where the inclination i is the angle between the
line of sight and the normal of the orbital plane.
Consider a binary where the components
move in circular orbits about the centre of mass.
Let the radii of the orbits be a1 and a2. From the
deﬁnition of the centre of mass m1a1 = m2a2,
and writing a = a1 + a2, one obtains
a1 =
am2
m1 + m2
.

Binary Stars and Stellar Masses
The true orbital velocity is
v0,1 = 2πa1
P
,
where P is the orbital period. The observed or-
bital velocity according to (10.3) is thus
v1 = 2πa1 sini
P
.
(10.5)
Substituting (10.4), one obtains
v1 = 2πa
P
m2 sini
m1 + m2
.
Solving for a and substituting it in Kepler’s third
law, one obtains the mass function equation:
m3
2 sin3 i
(m1 + m2)2 = v3
1P
2πG.
(10.6)
If one component in a spectroscopic binary is
so faint that its spectral lines cannot be observed,
only P and v1 are observed. Equation (10.6) then
gives the value of the mass function, which is
the expression on the left-hand side. Neither the
masses of the components nor the total mass can
be determined. If the spectral lines of both com-
ponents can be observed, v2 is also known. Then
(10.5) gives
v1
v2
= a1
a2
and furthermore the deﬁnition of the centre of
mass gives
m1 = m2v2
v1
.
When this is substituted in (10.6), the value of
m2 sin3 i, and correspondingly, m1 sin3 i, can be
determined. However, the actual masses cannot
be found without knowing the inclination.
The size of the binary orbit (the semimajor
axis a) is obtained from (10.5) apart from a fac-
tor sini. In general the orbits of binary stars are
not circular and the preceding expressions cannot
be applied as they stand. For an eccentric orbit,
the shape of the velocity variation departs more
and more from a simple sine curve as the ec-
centricity increases. From the shape of the veloc-
ity variation, both the eccentricity and the longi-
tude of the periastron can be determined. Know-
ing these, the mass function or the individual
masses can again be determined to within a fac-
tor sin3 i.
10.4
Photometric Binary Stars
In the photometric binaries, a periodic variation
in the total brightness is caused by the motions
of the components in a double system. Usu-
ally the photometric binaries are eclipsing vari-
ables, where the brightness variations are due to
the components passing in front of each other.
A class of photometric binaries where there are
no actual eclipses are the ellipsoidal variables.
In these systems, at least one of the components
has been distorted into an ellipsoidal shape by the
tidal pull of the other one. At different phases of
the orbit, the projected surface area of the dis-
torted component varies. The surface temperature
will also be lower at the ends of the tidal bulges.
Together these factors cause a small variation in
brightness.
The inclination of the orbit of an eclipsing bi-
nary must be very close to 90◦. These are the only
spectroscopic binaries for which the inclination is
known and thus the masses can be uniquely deter-
mined.
The variation of the magnitude of eclips-
ing variables as a function of time is called
the lightcurve. According to the shape of the
lightcurve, they are grouped into three main
types: Algol, β Lyrae and W Ursae Majoris type
(Fig. 10.6).
Algol Stars
The Algol-type eclipsing variables
have been named after β Persei or Algol. During
most of the period, the lightcurve is fairly con-
stant. This corresponds to phases during which
the stars are seen separate from each other and
the total magnitude remains constant. There are
two different minima in the lightcurve, one of
which, the primary minimum, is usually much
deeper than the other one. This is due to the
brightness difference of the stars. When the larger
star, which is usually a cool giant, eclipses the
smaller and hotter component, there is a deep
minimum in the lightcurve. When the small,

gol, β Lyrae and W Ursae Majoris type binary systems.
The size of the Sun is shown for comparison
bright star passes across the disk of the giant, the
total magnitude of the system does not change
by much.
The shape of the minima depends on whether
the eclipses are partial or total. In a partial eclipse
the lightcurve is smooth, since the brightness
changes smoothly as the depth of the eclipse
varies. In a total eclipse there is an interval dur-
ing which one component is completely invis-
ible. The total brightness is then constant and
the lightcurve has a ﬂat bottomed minimum. The
shape of the minima in Algol variables thus gives
information on the inclination of the orbit.
The duration of the minima depends on the ra-
tio of the stellar radii to the size of the orbit. If the
star is also a spectroscopic binary, the true dimen-
sions of the orbit can be obtained. In that case the
masses and the size of the orbit, and thus also the
radii can be determined without having to know
the distance of the system.
β Lyrae Stars
In the β Lyrae-type binaries, the
total magnitude varies continuously. The stars are
so close to each other that one of them has been
pulled into ellipsoidal shape. Thus the brightness
varies also outside the eclipses. The β Lyrae vari-
ables can be described as eclipsing ellipsoidal
variables. In the β Lyrae system itself, one star
has overﬁlled its Roche lobe (see Sect. 12.6) and
is steadily losing mass to its companion. The
mass transfer causes additional features in the
lightcurve.
W UMa Stars
In W UMa stars, the lightcurve
minima are almost identical, very round and
broad. These are close binary systems where both
components overﬁll their Roche lobes, forming
a contact binary system.
The observed lightcurves of photometric bi-
naries may contain many additional features that
confuse the preceding classiﬁcation.
– The shape of the star may be distorted by the
tidal force of the companion. The star may be
ellipsoidal or ﬁll its Roche surface, in which
case it becomes drop-like in shape.
– The limb darkening (Sects. 9.6 and 13.2) of the
star may be considerable. If the radiation from
the edges of the stellar disk is fainter than that
from the centre, it will tend to round off the
lightcurve.
– In elongated stars there is gravity darkening:
the parts most distant from the centre are cooler
and radiate less energy.
– There are also reﬂection phenomena in stars. If
the stars are close together, they will heat the
sides facing each other. The heated part of the
surface will then be brighter.
– In systems with mass transfer, the material
falling onto one of the components will change
the surface temperature.

246

Binary Stars and Stellar Masses
All these additional effects cause difﬁculties
in interpreting the lightcurve. Usually one com-
putes a theoretical model and the corresponding
lightcurve, which is then compared with the ob-
servations. The model is varied until a satisfac-
tory ﬁt is obtained.
So far we have been concerned solely with the
properties of binary systems in the optical do-
main. Recently many double systems that radiate
strongly at other wavelengths have been discov-
ered. Particularly interesting are the binary pul-
sars, where the velocity variation can be deter-
mined from radio observations. Many different
types of binaries have also been discovered at
X-ray wavelengths. These systems will be dis-
cussed in Chap. 15.
The binary stars are the only stars with ac-
curately known masses. The masses for other
stars are estimated from the mass-luminosity re-
lation (Sect. 9.7), but that is valid only for main-
sequence stars and has to be calibrated by means
of binary observations.
10.5
Examples
Example 10.1 (The Mass of a Binary Star) The
distance of a binary star is 10 pc and the largest
angular separation of the components is 7′′ and
the smallest is 1′′. The orbital period is 100 years.
The mass of the binary is to be determined, as-
suming that the orbital plane is normal to the line
of sight.
From the angular separation and the distance,
the semimajor axis is
a = 4′′ × 10 pc = 40 au.
According to Kepler’s third law
m1 + m2 = a3
P 2 = 403
1002 M⊙= 6.4 M⊙.
Let the semimajor axis of one component be a1 =
3′′ and for the other a2 = 1′′. Now the masses of
the components can be determined separately:
m1a1 = m2a2
⇒
m1 = a2
a1
m2 = m2
3 ,
m1 + m2 = 6.4
⇒
m1 = 1.6,
m2 = 4.8.
Example 10.2 (The Lightcurve of a Binary) Let
us suppose that the line of sight lies in the orbital
plane of an Algol type binary, where both com-
ponents have the same radius. The lightcurve is
essentially as shown in the ﬁgure. The primary
minimum occurs when the brighter component is
eclipsed. The depth of the minima will be calcu-
lated.
If the effective temperatures of the stars are TA
and TB and their radius is R, their luminosities
are given by
LA = 4πR2σT 4
A,
LB = 4πR2σT 4
B.
The ﬂat part of the curve corresponds to the total
luminosity
Ltot = LA + LB.
The luminosities may be expressed as absolute
bolometric magnitudes by means of (4.13). Since
the distance moduli of the components are the
same, the apparent bolometric magnitude at the
primary minimum will be

Stellar Structure
The stars are huge gas spheres, hundreds of thou-
sands or millions of times more massive than the
Earth. A star such as the Sun can go on shin-
ing steadily for thousands of millions of years.
This is shown by studies of the prehistory of
the Earth, which indicate that the energy radi-
ated by the Sun has not changed by much during
the last four thousand million years. The equilib-
rium of a star must remain stable for such peri-
ods.
11.1
Internal Equilibrium Conditions
Mathematically the conditions for the internal
equilibrium of a star can be expressed as four
differential equations governing the distribution
of mass, gas pressure and energy production and
transport in the star. These equations will now be
derived.
Hydrostatic Equilibrium
The force of gravity
pulls the stellar material towards the centre. It is
resisted by the pressure force due to the thermal
motions of the gas molecules. The ﬁrst equilib-
rium condition is that these forces be in equilib-
rium.
Consider a cylindrical volume element at the
distance r from the centre of the star (Fig. 11.1).
Its volume is dV = dAdr, where dA is its base
area and dr its height; its mass is dm = ρ dAdr,
where ρ = ρ(r) is the gas density at the radius r.
If the mass inside radius r is Mr, the gravitational

itational and pressure force acting on a volume element is
zero

dFg = −GMr dm

dAdr,
where G is the gravitational constant. The minus
sign in this expression means that the force is di-
rected towards the centre of the star. If the pres-
sure at the lower surface of the volume element
is P and at its upper surface P +dP , the net force
of pressure acting on the element is
dFp = P dA −(P + dP)dA
= −dP dA.
Since the pressure decreases outwards, dP will
be negative and the force dFp positive. The equi-

librium condition is that the total force acting on
the volume element should be zero, i.e.

.
(11.1)
This is the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.
Mass Distribution
The second equation gives
the mass contained within a given radius. Con-
sider a spherical shell of thickness dr at the dis-
tance r from the centre (Fig. 11.2). Its mass is
dMr = 4πr2ρ dr,
giving the mass continuity equation
dMr
dr
= 4πr2ρ.
(11.2)
Energy Production
The third equilibrium con-
dition expresses the conservation of energy, re-
quiring that any energy produced in the star has
to be carried to the surface and radiated away. We
again consider a spherical shell of thickness dr
Fig. 11.2 The mass of a thin spherical shell is the product
of its volume and its density
and mass dMr at the radius r (Fig. 11.3). Let Lr
be the energy ﬂux, i.e. the amount of energy pass-
ing through the surface r per unit time. If ε is the
energy production coefﬁcient, i.e. the amount of
energy released in the star per unit time and mass,
then
dLr = Lr+dr −Lr = ε dMr = 4πr2ρε dr.
Thus the energy conservation equation is
dLr
dr = 4πr2ρε.
(11.3)
The rate at which energy is produced depends on
the distance to the centre. Essentially all of the
energy radiated by the star is produced in the hot
and dense core. In the outer layers the energy pro-
duction is negligible and Lr is almost constant.
The Temperature Gradient
The fourth equi-
librium equation gives the temperature change as
a function of the radius, i.e. the temperature gra-
dient dT /dr. The form of the equation depends
on how the energy is transported: by conduction,
convection or radiation.
In the interiors of normal stars conduction is
very inefﬁcient, since the electrons carrying the
energy can only travel a short distance with-
out colliding with other particles. Conduction

the sum of the energy ﬂowing into it and the energy gen-
erated within the shell

only becomes important in compact stars, white
dwarfs and neutron stars, where the mean free
path of photons is extremely short, but that of
some electrons can be relatively large. In nor-
mal stars conductive energy transport can be ne-
glected.
In radiative energy transport, photons emitted
in hotter parts of the star are absorbed in cooler
regions, which they heat. The star is said to be in
radiative equilibrium, when the energy released
in the stellar interior is carried outwards entirely
by radiation.
The radiative temperature gradient is related to
the energy ﬂux Lr according to

(11.4)
where a = 4σ/c = 7.564 × 10−16 Jm−3 K−4 is
the radiation constant, c the speed of light, and
ρ the density. The mass absorption coefﬁcient κ
gives the amount of absorption per unit mass. Its
value depends on the temperature, density and
chemical composition.
In order to derive (11.4), we consider the equa-
tion of radiative transfer (5.44). In terms of the
variables used in the present chapter, it may be
written
cosθ dIν
dr = −κνρIν + jν.
In this equation κν is replaced with a suitable
mean value κ. The equation is then multiplied
with cosθ and integrated over all directions and
frequencies. On the left hand side, Iν may be ap-
proximated with the Planck function Bν. The fre-
quency integral may then be evaluated by means
of (5.16). On the right-hand side, the ﬁrst term
can be expressed in terms of the ﬂux density ac-
cording to (4.2) and the integral over directions of
the second gives zero, since jν does not depend
on θ. One thus obtains

= −κρFr.
Finally, using the relation
Fr =
Lr
4πr2 ,
between the ﬂux density Fr and the energy
ﬂux Lr, one obtains (11.4).
The derivative dT /dr is negative, since the
temperature increases inwards. Clearly there has
to be a temperature gradient, if energy is to be
transported by radiation: otherwise the radiation
ﬁeld would be the same in all directions and the
net ﬂux Fr would vanish.
If the radiative transfer of energy becomes in-
efﬁcient, the absolute value of the radiative tem-
perature gradient becomes very large. In that case
motions are set up in the gas, which carry the
energy outwards more efﬁciently than the radi-
ation. In these convective motions, hot gas rises
upwards into cooler layers, where it loses its en-
ergy and sinks again. The rising and sinking gas
elements also mix the stellar material, and the
composition of the convective parts of a star be-
comes homogeneous. Radiation and conduction,
on the other hand, do not mix the material, since
they move only energy, not gas.
In order to derive the temperature gradient for
the convective case, consider a rising bubble. As-
sume that the gas moving with the bubble obeys
the adiabatic equation of state
T ∝P 1−1
γ ,
(11.5)
where P is the pressure of the gas and γ , the adi-
abatic exponent
γ = CP/CV,
(11.6)
is the ratio of the speciﬁc heats in constant pres-
sure and constant volume. This ratio of the spe-
ciﬁc heats depends on the ionisation of the gas,
and can be computed when the temperature, den-
sity and chemical composition are known.
Taking the derivative of (11.5) we get the ex-
pression for the convective temperature gradient

(11.7)
In the practical computation of stellar struc-
ture, one uses either (11.4) or (11.7), depending
on which equation gives a less steep temperature
gradient. In the outermost layers of stars heat ex-
change with the surroundings must be taken into

252

Stellar Structure
account, and (11.7) is no longer a good approxi-
mation. An often used method for calculating the
convective temperature gradient in that case is the
mixing-length theory. The theory of convection is
a difﬁcult and still imperfectly understood prob-
lem, which is beyond the scope of this presenta-
tion.
The convective motions set in when the radia-
tive temperature gradient becomes larger in ab-
solute value than the adiabatic gradient, i.e. if ei-
ther the radiative gradient becomes steep or if the
convective gradient becomes small. From (11.4)
it can be seen that a steep radiative gradient is
expected, if either the energy ﬂux density or the
mass absorption coefﬁcient becomes large. The
convective gradient may become small, if the adi-
abatic exponent approaches 1.
Boundary Conditions
In order to obtain a well-
posed problem, some boundary conditions have
to be prescribed for the preceding differential
equations:
– There are no sources of energy or mass at the
centre inside the radius r = 0; thus M0 = 0 and
L0 = 0.
– The total mass within the radius R of the star
is ﬁxed, MR = M.
– The temperature and pressure at the stellar sur-
face have some determinate values, TR and PR.
These will be very small compared to those in
the interior, and thus it is usually sufﬁcient to
take TR = 0 and PR = 0.
In addition to these boundary conditions one
needs an expression for the pressure, which is
given by the equation of state as well as expres-
sions for the mass absorption coefﬁcient and the
energy generation rate, which will be considered
later. The solution of the basic differential equa-
tions give the mass, temperature, density and en-
ergy ﬂux as functions of the radius. The stellar
radius and luminosity can then be calculated and
compared with the observations.
The properties of a stellar equilibrium model
are essentially determined once the mass and the
chemical composition have been given. This re-
sult is known as the Vogt–Russell theorem.
11.2
Physical State of the Gas
Due to the high temperature the gas in the stars is
almost completely ionised. The interactions be-
tween individual particles are small, so that, to
a good approximation, the gas obeys the perfect
gas equation of state,
P =
k
μmH
ρT,
(11.8)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant, μ the mean
molecular weight in units of mH, and mH the
mass of the hydrogen atom.
The mean molecular weight can be approxi-
mately calculated assuming complete ionisation.
An atom with nuclear charge Z then produces
Z +1 free particles (the nucleus and Z electrons).
Hydrogen gives rise to two particles per atomic
mass unit; helium gives rise to three particles per
four atomic mass units. For all elements heavier
than hydrogen and helium it is usually sufﬁcient
to take Z + 1 to be half the atomic weight. (Exact
values could easily be calculated, but the abun-
dance of heavy elements is so small that this is
usually not necessary.) In astrophysics the rela-
tive mass fraction of hydrogen is conventionally
denoted by X, that of helium by Y and that of all
heavier elements by Z, so that
X + Y + Z = 1.
(11.9)
(The Z occurring in this equation should not be
confused with the nuclear charge, which is un-
fortunately denoted by the same letter.) Thus the
mean molecular weight will be
μ =
1
2X + 3
4 Y + 1
2 Z
.
(11.10)
At high temperatures the radiation pressure
has to be added to the gas pressure described by
the perfect gas equation. The pressure exerted by
radiation is (see Box 11.2)
Prad = 1
3 aT 4,
(11.11)
where a is the radiation constant. Thus the total
pressure is
P =

μmH
ρT + 1
3aT 4.
(11.12)

11.2
Physical State of the Gas
253
The perfect gas law does not apply at very high
densities.
The Pauli exclusion principle states that an
atom with several electrons cannot have more
than one electron with all four quantum numbers
equal. This can also be generalised to a gas con-
sisting of electrons (or other fermions). A phase
space can be used to describe the electrons. The
phase space is a 6-dimensional space, three coor-
dinates of which give the position of the particle
and the other three coordinates the momenta in
x, y and z directions. A volume element of the
phase space is
V = xyzpxpypz.
(11.13)
From the uncertainty principle it follows that the
smallest meaningful volume element is of the or-
der of h3. According to the exclusion principle
there can be only two electrons with opposite
spins in such a volume element. When density
becomes high enough, all volume elements of the
phase space will be ﬁlled up to a certain limiting
momentum. Such matter is called degenerate.
Electron gas begins to degenerate when the
density is of the order 107 kg/m3. In ordinary
stars the gas is usually nondegenerate, but in
white dwarfs and in neutron stars, degeneracy is
of central importance. The pressure of a degener-
ate electron gas is (see Box 11.2)
P ≈

(11.14)
where me is the electron mass and N/V the num-

may be written in terms of the density
ρ = NμemH/V,
where μe is the mean molecular weight per free
electron in units of mH. An expression for μe may
be derived in analogy with (11.10):
μe =

(11.15)
For the solar hydrogen abundance this yields
μe = 2/(0.71 + 1) = 1.17.

(11.16)
This is the equation of state of a degenerate elec-
tron gas. In contrast to the perfect gas law the
pressure no longer depends on the temperature,
only on the density and on the particle masses.
In normal stars the degenerate gas pressure is
negligible, but in the central parts of giant stars
and in white dwarfs, where the density is of the
order of 108 kg/m3, the degenerate gas pressure
is dominant, in spite of the high temperature.
At even higher densities the electron momenta
become so large that their velocities approach the
speed of light. In this case the formulas of the
special theory of relativity have to be used. The

In the relativistic case the pressure is proportional
to the density to the power 4/3, rather than 5/3
as for the nonrelativistic case. The transition to
the relativistic situation takes place roughly at the
density 109 kg/m3.
In general the pressure inside a star depends
on the temperature (except for a completely de-
generate gas), density and chemical composition.
In actual stars the gas will never be totally ionised
or completely degenerate. The pressure will then
be given by more complicated expressions. Still
it can be calculated for each case of interest. One
may then write
P = P(T,ρ,X,Y,Z),
(11.18)
giving the pressure as a known function of the
temperature, density and chemical composition.
The opacity of the gas describes how difﬁcult
it is for radiation to propagate through it. The
change dI of the intensity in a distance dr can
be expressed as
dI = −Iα dr,
where α is the opacity (Sect. 4.5). The opacity
depends on the chemical composition, tempera-

ture and density of the gas. It is usually written as
α = κρ, where ρ is the density of the gas and κ
the mass absorption coefﬁcient ([κ] = m2/kg).
The inverse of the opacity represents the mean
free path of radiation in the medium, i.e. the dis-
tance it can propagate without being scattered
or absorbed. The different types of absorption
processes (bound–bound, bound–free, free–free)
have been described in Sect. 5.1. The opacity of
the stellar material due to each process can be
calculated for relevant values of temperature and
density.
11.3
Stellar Energy Sources
When the equations of stellar structure were de-
rived, the character of the source of stellar energy
was left unspeciﬁed. Knowing a typical stellar lu-
minosity, one can calculate how long different
energy sources would last. For instance, normal
chemical burning could produce energy for only
a few thousand years. The energy released by the
contraction of a star would last slightly longer,
but after a few million years this energy source
would also run out.
Terrestrial biological and geological evidence
shows that the solar luminosity has remained
fairly constant for at least a few thousand mil-
lion years. Since the age of the Earth is about
5000 million years, the Sun has presumably ex-
isted at least for that time. Since the solar lu-
minosity is 4 × 1026 W, it has radiated about
6 × 1043 J in 5 × 109 years. The Sun’s mass is
2 × 1030 kg; thus it must be able to produce at
least 3 × 1013 J/kg.
The general conditions in the solar interior
are known, regardless of the exact energy source.
Thus, in Example 11.5, it will be estimated that
the temperature at half the radius is about 5 mil-
lion degrees. The central temperature must be
about ten million kelvins, which is high enough
for thermonuclear fusion reactions to take place.
In fusion reactions light elements are trans-
formed into heavier ones. The ﬁnal reaction prod-
ucts have a smaller total mass than the initial nu-
clei. This mass difference is released as energy
according to Einstein’s relation E = mc2. Ther-
monuclear reactions are commonly referred to as
burning, although they have no relation to the
chemical burning of ordinary fuels.
The atomic nucleus consists of protons and
neutrons, together referred to as nucleons. We de-
ﬁne
mp = proton mass,
mn = neutron mass,
Z = nuclear charge = atomic number,
N = neutron number,
A = Z + N = atomic weight,
m(Z,N) = mass of the nucleus.
The mass of the nucleus is smaller than the
sum of the masses of all its nucleons. The dif-
ference is called the binding energy. The binding
energy per nucleon is
Q = 1
A

Zmp + Nmn −m(Z,N)

c2.
(11.19)
It turns out that Q increases towards heavier ele-
ments up to iron (Z = 26). Beyond iron the bind-
ing energy again begins to decrease (Fig. 11.4).
It is known that the stars consist mostly of hy-
drogen. Let us consider how much energy would
be released by the fusion of four hydrogen nu-
clei into a helium nucleus. The mass of a pro-
ton is 1.672 × 10−27 kg and that of a helium nu-
cleus is 6.644 × 10−27 kg. The mass difference,
4.6 × 10−29 kg, corresponds to an energy differ-
ence E = 4.1 × 10−12 J. Thus 0.7 % of the mass
is turned into energy in the reaction, correspond-
ing to an energy release of 6.4 × 1014 J per one
kilogram of hydrogen. This should be compared
with our previous estimate that 3 × 1013 J/kg is
needed.
Already in the 1930’s it was generally ac-
cepted that stellar energy had to be produced by
nuclear fusion. In 1938 Hans Bethe and inde-
pendently Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker put for-
ward the ﬁrst detailed mechanism for energy pro-
duction in the stars, the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen
(CNO) cycle. The other important energy gener-

ation processes (the proton–proton chain and the
triple-alpha reaction) were not proposed until the
1950’s.
The Proton–Proton Chain
(Fig. 11.5). In stars
with masses of about that of the Sun or smaller,
the energy is produced by the proton–proton (pp)
chain. It consists of the following steps:
ppI:
(1)
1H + 1H
→2H + e+ + νe,
1H + 1H + e−→2H + νe,
(2)
2H + 1H
→3He + γ,
(3)
3He + 3He
→4He + 2 1H.
For each reaction (3) the reactions (1) and (2)
have to take place twice. The ﬁrst reaction step
has a very small probability, which has not been
measured in the laboratory. At the central den-
sity and temperature of the Sun, the expected
time for a proton to collide with another one to
form a deuteron is 1010 years on the average. It is
only thanks to the slowness of this reaction that
the Sun is still shining. If it were faster, the Sun
would have burnt out long ago. The neutrino pro-
duced in the reaction (1) can escape freely from
the star and carries away some of the energy re-
leased. The positron e+ is immediately annihi-
lated together with an electron, giving rise to two
gamma quanta.
The second reaction, where a deuteron and
a proton unite to form the helium isotope 3He, is
very fast compared to the preceding one. Thus the
abundance of deuterons inside stars is very small.
The last step in the pp chain can take three dif-
ferent forms. The ppI chain shown above is the
most probable one. In the Sun 91 % of the energy
is produced by the ppI chain. It is also possible
for 3He nuclei to unite into 4He nuclei in two ad-
ditional branches of the pp chain.
ppII:
(3)
3He + 4He →7Be + γ,
(4)
7Be + e−
→7Li + νe,
(5)
7Li + 1H
→4He + 4He,
ppIII:
(3)
3He + 4He →7Be + γ,
(4)
7Be + 1H →8B + γ,
(5)
8B
→8Be + e+ + νe,
(6)
8Be
→4He + 4He.
The Carbon Cycle
(See Fig. 11.6.) At tem-
peratures below 20 million degrees the pp chain
is the main energy production mechanism. At
higher temperatures corresponding to stars with
masses above 1.5M⊙, the carbon (CNO) cycle
becomes dominant, because its reaction rate in-
creases more rapidly with temperature. In the
CNO cycle carbon, oxygen and nitrogen act as

256

Stellar Structure
Fig. 11.5 The
proton–proton chain. In the
ppI branch, four protons
are transformed into one
helium nucleus, two
positrons, two neutrinos
and radiation. The relative
weights of the reactions are
given for conditions in the
Sun. The pp chain is the
most important energy
source in stars with mass
below 1.5M⊙
catalysts. The reaction cycle is the following:
(1)
12C + 1H →13N + γ,
(2)
13N
→13C + e+ + νe,
(3)
13C + 1H →14N + γ,
(4)
14N + 1H →15O + γ,
(5)
15O
→15N + γ + νe,
(6)
15N + 1H →12C + 4He.
Reaction (4) is the slowest, and thus deter-
mines the rate of the CNO cycle. At a tempera-
ture of 20 million degrees the reaction time for
the reaction (4) is a million years.
The fraction of energy released as radiation in
the CNO cycle is slightly smaller than in the pp
chain, because more energy is carried away by
neutrinos.
The Triple Alpha Reaction
As a result of the
preceding reactions, the abundance of helium in
the stellar interior increases. At a temperature
above 108 degrees the helium can be transformed
into carbon in the triple alpha reaction:
(1)
4He + 4He ↔8Be,
(2)
8Be + 4He →12C + γ.
Here 8Be is unstable and decays into two he-
lium nuclei or alpha particles in 2.6 × 10−16 sec-
onds. The production of carbon thus requires the
almost simultaneous collision of three particles.
The reaction is often written
3 4He →12C + γ.
Once helium burning has been completed, at
higher temperatures other reactions become pos-

11.4
Stellar Models
257
Fig. 11.6 The CNO cycle is catalysed by 12C. It trans-
forms four protons into a helium nucleus, two positrons,
two neutrinos and radiation. It is the dominant energy
source for stars more massive than 1.5M⊙
sible, in which heavier elements up to iron and
nickel are built up. Examples of such reactions
are various alpha reactions and oxygen, carbon
and silicon burning.
Alpha Reactions
During helium burning some
of the carbon nuclei produced react with helium
nuclei to form oxygen, which in turn reacts to
form neon, etc. These reactions are fairly rare and
thus are not important as stellar energy sources.
Examples are
12C + 4He →16O + γ,
16O + 4He →20Ne + γ,
20Ne + 4He →24Mg + γ.
Carbon Burning
After the helium is exhausted,
carbon burning sets in at the temperature (5–8) ×
1010 K:
12C + 12C →24Mg + γ
→23Na + 1H
→20Ne + 4He
→23Mg + n
→16O + 2 4He.
Oxygen Burning
Oxygen is consumed at
slightly higher temperatures in the reactions
16O + 16O →32S + γ
→31P + 1H
→28Si + 4He
→31S + n
→24Mg + 2 4He.
Silicon Burning
After several intermediate
steps the burning of silicon produces nickel and
iron. The total process may be expressed as
28Si + 28Si →56Ni + γ,
56Ni
→56Fe + 2e+ + 2νe.
When the temperature becomes higher than
about 109 K, the energy of the photons becomes
large enough to destroy certain nuclei. Such re-
actions are called photonuclear reactions or pho-
todissociations.
The production of elements heavier than iron
requires an input of energy, and therefore such
elements cannot be produced by thermonuclear
reactions. Elements heavier than iron are almost
exclusively produced by neutron capture dur-
ing the ﬁnal violent stages of stellar evolution
(Sect. 11.5).
The rates of the reactions presented above can
be determined by laboratory experiments or by
theoretical calculations. Knowing them, one can
calculate the rate at which energy is released per
unit mass and time as a function of the density,
temperature and chemical composition:
ε = ε(T,ρ,X,Y,Z).
(11.20)
In reality the relative abundance of each of the
heavier nuclei needs to be known, not just their
total abundance Z.
11.4
Stellar Models
A theoretical stellar model is obtained if one
solves the differential equations for stellar struc-
ture. As we have already noted, the model is
uniquely deﬁned once the chemical composition
and the mass of the star have been given.

Stars just formed out of the interstellar me-
dium are chemically homogeneous. When stel-
lar models for homogeneous stars are plotted in
the HR diagram, they fall along the lower edge of
the main sequence. The theoretical sequence ob-
tained in this way is called the zero age main se-
quence, ZAMS. The exact position of the ZAMS
depends on the initial chemical composition. For
stars with an initial abundance of heavy elements
like that in the Sun, the computed ZAMS is in
good agreement with the observations. If the ini-
tial value of Z is smaller, the theoretical ZAMS
falls below the main sequence in the subdwarf
region of the HR diagram. This is related to the
classiﬁcation of stars into populations I and II,
which is discussed in Sect. 17.2.
The theoretical models also provide an ex-
planation for the mass–luminosity relation. The
computed properties of zero age main sequence
stars of different masses are given in Table 11.1.
The chemical composition assumed is X = 0.71
(hydrogen mass fraction), Y = 0.27 (helium)
and Z = 0.02 (heavier elements), except for the
30M⊙star, which has X = 0.70 and Y = 0.28.
The luminosity of a one solar mass star is 0.74L⊙
and the radius 0.87R⊙. Thus the Sun has bright-
ened and expanded to some extent during its evo-
lution. However, these changes are small and do
not conﬂict with the evidence for a steady solar
energy output. In addition the biological evidence
only goes back about 3000 million years.
The model calculations show that the central
temperature in the smallest stars (M ≈0.08M⊙)
is about 4 × 106 K, which is the minimum tem-
perature required for the onset of thermonuclear
reactions. In the biggest stars (M ≈50M⊙), the
central temperature reaches 4 × 107 K.
The changes in chemical composition caused
by the nuclear reactions can be computed, since
the rates of the various reactions at different
depths in the star are known. For example, the
change X of the hydrogen abundance in the
time interval t is proportional to the rate of en-
ergy generation ε and to t:
X ∝−εt.
(11.21)
The constant of proportionality is clearly the
amount of hydrogen consumed per unit energy
[kg/J]. The value of this constant of proportion-
ality is different for the pp chain and the CNO
cycle. Therefore the contribution from each re-
action chain must be calculated separately in
(11.21). For elements that are produced by the
nuclear reactions, the right-hand side contribution
in (11.21) is positive. If the star is convective, the
change in composition is obtained by taking the
average of (11.21) over the convection zone.
Box 11.1 (Gas Pressure and Radiation Pres-
sure) Let us consider noninteracting particles
in a rectangular box. The particles may also be
photons. Let the sides of the box be x, y
and z, and the number of particles, N. The
pressure is caused by the collisions of the par-
ticles with the sides of the box. When a par-
ticle hits a wall perpendicular to the x axis,
its momentum in the x direction, px, changes
by p = 2px. The particle will return to the

11.4

the pressure exerted by the particles on the wall
(surface area A = yz) is

where V = xyz is the volume of the box
and the angular brackets represent the aver-

m = hν/c2 for photons), and hence
P = Nm⟨v2

Suppose the velocities of the particles are

If the particles are gas molecules, the energy
of a molecule is ε = 1

of the gas is E = N⟨ε⟩= 1

If the particles are photons, they move with the

c F = 4
c σT 4 ≡aT 4,
where a = 4σ/c is the radiation constant. Thus
the radiation pressure is

Box 11.2 (The Pressure of a Degenerate Gas)
A gas where all available energy levels up to
a limiting momentum p0, known as the Fermi
momentum, are ﬁlled is called degenerate. We
shall determine the pressure of a completely
degenerate electron gas.
Let the volume of the gas be V . We con-
sider electrons with momenta in the range
[p,p + dp]. Their available phase space vol-
ume is 4πp2dpV . According to the Heisen-
berg uncertainty relation the elementary vol-
ume in phase space is h3 and, according to the
Pauli exclusion principle, this volume can con-
tain two electrons with opposite spins. Thus the
number of electrons in the momentum interval
[p,p + dp] is
dN = 24πp2 dp V

If the density becomes so

The preceding derivations are rigorously
valid only at zero temperature. However, the
densities in compact stars are so high that the
effects of a nonzero temperature are negligible,
and the gas may be considered completely de-
generate.

Examples
Example 11.1 (The Gravitational Acceleration at
the Solar Surface) The expression for the gravi-
tational acceleration is
g = GM⊙
R2 .
Using the solar mass M = 1.989 × 1030 kg and
radius R = 6.96 × 108 m, one obtains
g = 274 ms−2 ≈28g0,
where g0 = 9.81 ms−2 is the gravitational accel-
eration at the surface of the Earth.
Example 11.2 (The Average Density of the Sun)
The volume of a sphere with radius R is
V = 4
3πR3;
thus the average density of the Sun is
ρ = M
V = 3M
4πR3 ≈1410 kgm−3.
Example 11.3 (Pressure at Half the Solar Radius)
The pressure can be estimated from the condition
for the hydrostatic equilibrium (11.1). Suppose
the density is constant and equal to the average
density ρ. Then the mass within the radius r is
Mr = 4

and the hydrostatic equation can be written

This estimate is extremely rough, since the den-
sity increases strongly inwards.
Example 11.4 (The Mean Molecular Weight of
the Sun)
In the outer layers of the Sun the ini-
tial chemical composition has not been changed
by nuclear reactions. In this case one can use the
values X = 0.71, Y = 0.27 and Z = 0.02. The
mean molecular weight (11.10) is then
μ =
1
2 × 0.71 + 0.75 × 0.27 + 0.5 × 0.02
≈0.61.
When the hydrogen is completely exhausted,
X = 0 and Y = 0.98, and hence
μ =
1
0.75 × 0.98 + 0.5 × 0.02 ≈1.34.
Example 11.5 (The Temperature of the Sun
at r = R⊙/2)
Using the density from Exam-
ple 11.2 and the pressure from Example 11.3,
the temperature can be estimated from the per-
fect gas law (11.8). Assuming the surface value
for the mean molecular weight (Example 11.4),
one obtains the temperature
T = μmHP
kρ
= 0.61 × 1.67 × 10−27 × 1.0 × 1014
1.38 × 10−23 × 1410
≈5 × 106 K.
Example 11.6 (The Radiation Pressure in the
Sun at r = R⊙/2)
In the previous example we
found that the temperature is T ≈5×106 K. Thus
the radiation pressure given by (11.11) is
Prad = 1
3 aT 4
= 1
3 × 7.564 × 10−16 × (5 × 106)4
≈2 × 1011 Pa.
This is about a thousand times smaller than the
gas pressure estimated in Example 11.3. Thus it
conﬁrms that the use of the perfect gas law in Ex-
ample 11.5 was correct.
Example 11.7 (The Path of a Photon from the
Centre of a Star to Its Surface)
Radiative en-
ergy transport can be described as a random walk,
where a photon is repeatedly absorbed and re-
emitted in a random direction. Let the step length

The time taken by a photon to reach the sur-
face from the centre depends on the mean free
path d = 1/α = 1/κρ. The value of κ at half
the solar radius can be estimated from the val-
ues of density and temperature obtained in Ex-
amples 11.2 and 11.5. The mass absorption co-
efﬁcient in these conditions is found to be κ =
10 m2/kg. (We shall not enter on how it is calcu-
lated.) The photon mean free path is then
d = 1
κρ ≈10−4 m.
This should be a reasonable estimate in most
of the solar interior. Since the solar radius r =
109 m, the number of steps needed to reach the
surface will be N = (r/d)2 = 1026. The total path
travelled by the photon is s = Nd = 1022 m, and
the time taken is t = s/c = 106 years; a more
careful calculation gives t = 107 years. Thus it
takes 10 million years for the energy generated
at the centre to radiate into space. Of course the
radiation that leaves the surface does not consist
of the same gamma photons that were produced
near the centre. The intervening scattering, emis-
sion and absorption processes have transformed
the radiation into visible light (as can easily be
seen).

Stellar Evolution
In the preceding chapter we have seen how one
can compute the evolution of a star by starting
from a homogeneous model representing a newly
formed system. When the chemical composition
of the star changes with time, a new model is
computed each time. In this chapter we shall con-
sider the theoretical evolutionary paths of sys-
tems with various masses and see how the com-
puted evolution explains the observational data.
The following discussion is rather qualitative,
since the details of the theoretical calculations
are too involved for the present book. Also, the
different evolutionary tracks would become pro-
hibitively complicated if more than the very basic
stellar properties were included.
12.1
Evolutionary Time Scales
Changes in a star may take place on quite differ-
ent time scales at different evolutionary phases.
There are three important basic time scales: the
nuclear time scale tn, the thermal time scale tt and
the dynamical or freefall time scale td.
The Nuclear Time Scale
The time in which
a star radiates away all the energy that can be
released by nuclear reactions is called the nu-
clear time scale. An estimate of this time can be
obtained if one calculates the time in which all
available hydrogen is turned into helium. On the
basis of theoretical considerations and evolution-
ary computations it is known that only just over
10 % of the total mass of hydrogen in the star can
be consumed before other, more rapid evolution-
ary mechanisms set in. Since 0.7 % of the rest
mass is turned into energy in hydrogen burning,
the nuclear time scale will be
tn ≈0.007 × 0.1Mc2
L
.
(12.1)
For the Sun one obtains the nuclear time scale
1010 years, and thus
tn ≈M/M⊙
L/L⊙
× 1010 a.
(12.2)
This gives the nuclear time scale as a function
of the mass M and luminosity L of a given star.
For example, if the mass is 30M⊙, one obtains tn
about 2 million years. The reason for the shorter
time scale is that the stellar luminosity strongly
increases for higher masses (Table 12.1).
The Thermal Time Scale
The time in which
a star would radiate away all its thermal energy
if the nuclear energy production were suddenly
turned off is called the thermal time scale. This is
also the time it takes for radiation from the centre
to reach the surface. According to the virial theo-
rem (6.51) the kinetic energy of the thermal mo-
tion of the gas particles equals half of the poten-
tial energy. Thus he thermal time scale is roughly
may be estimated as
tt ≈0.5GM2/R
L

where G is the constant of gravity and R the stel-
lar radius. For the Sun the thermal time scale is
about 20 million years or 1/500 of the nuclear
time scale.
The Dynamical Time Scale
The third and
shortest time scale is the time it would take a star
to collapse if the pressure supporting it against
gravity were suddenly removed. It can be esti-
mated from the time it would take for a particle
to fall freely from the stellar surface to the cen-
tre. This is half of the period given by Kepler’s
third law, where the semimajor axis of the orbit
corresponds to half the stellar radius R:

The dynamical time scale of the Sun is about half
an hour.
The ordering of the time scales is normally
like that in the Sun, i.e. td ≪tt ≪tn.
12.2
The Contraction of Stars
Towards the Main Sequence
The formation and subsequent gravitational col-
lapse of condensations in the interstellar medium
will be considered in a later chapter. Here we
shall follow the behaviour of such a protostar,
when it is already in the process of contraction.
When a cloud contracts, gravitational potential
energy is released and transformed into thermal
energy of the gas and into radiation. Initially the
radiation can propagate freely through the mate-
rial, because the density is low and the opacity
small. Therefore most of the liberated energy is
radiated away and the temperature does not in-
crease. The contraction takes place on the dynam-
ical time scale; the gas is falling freely inwards.
The density and the pressure increase most
rapidly near the centre of the cloud. As the den-
sity increases, so does the opacity. A larger frac-
tion of the released energy is then turned into
heat, and the temperature begins to rise. This
leads to a further increase in the pressure that is
resisting the free fall. The contraction of the cen-
tral part of the cloud slows down. The outer parts,
however, are still falling freely.
At this stage, the cloud may already be con-
sidered a protostar. It consists mainly of hydrogen
in molecular form. When the temperature reaches
1800 K, the hydrogen molecules are dissociated
into atoms. The dissociation consumes energy,
and the rise in temperature is slowed down. The
pressure then also grows more slowly and this in
turn means that the rate of contraction increases.
The same sequence of events is repeated, ﬁrst
when hydrogen is ionised at 104 K, and then
when helium is ionised. When the temperature
has reached about 105 K, the gas is essentially
completely ionised.
The contraction of a protostar only stops when
a large fraction of the gas is fully ionised in the
form of plasma. The star then settles into hy-
drostatic equilibrium. Its further evolution takes

contracting to the main
sequence on the thermal
time scale. After a rapid
dynamical collapse the
stars settle on the Hayashi
track and evolve towards
the main sequence on the
thermal time scale.
(Models by Iben, I. (1965):
Astrophys. J. 141, 993)
place on the thermal time scale, i.e. much more
slowly. The radius of the protostar has shrunk
from its original value of about 100 au to about
1/4 au. It will usually be located inside a larger
gas cloud and will be accreting material from its
surroundings. Its mass therefore grows, and the
central temperature and density increase.
The temperature of a star that has just reached
equilibrium is still low and its opacity corre-
spondingly large. Thus it will be convective in its
centre. The convective energy transfer is quite ef-
ﬁcient and the surface of the protostar will there-
fore be relatively bright.
We now describe the evolution in the HR di-
agram. Initially the protostar will be faint and
cool, and it will reside at the lower far right in
the HR diagram (outside Fig. 12.1). During the
collapse its surface rapidly heats up and bright-
ens and it moves to the upper right of Fig. 12.1.
At the end of the collapse the star will settle at
a point corresponding to its mass on the Hayashi
track. The Hayashi track (Fig. 12.1) gives the lo-
cation in the HR diagram of completely convec-
tive stars. Stars to its right cannot be in equi-
librium and will collapse on the dynamic time
scale.
The star will now evolve almost along the
Hayashi track on the thermal time scale. In the
HR diagram it moves almost vertically down-
wards, its radius decreases and its luminosity

drops (Fig. 12.1). As the temperature goes on in-
creasing in its centre, the opacity diminishes and
energy begins to be transported by radiation. The
mass of the radiative region will gradually grow
until ﬁnally most of the star is radiative. By then
the central temperature will have become so large
that nuclear reactions begin. Previously all the
stellar energy had been released potential energy,
but now the nuclear reactions make a growing
contribution and the luminosity increases. The
stellar surface temperature will also increase and
the star will move slightly upwards to the left
in the HR diagram. In massive stars, this turn to
the left occurs much earlier, because their central
temperatures are higher and the nuclear reactions
are initiated earlier.
For solar mass stars, the rapid collapse of the
protostellar cloud only lasts for a few hundred
years. The ﬁnal stage of condensation is much
slower, lasting several tens of millions of years.
This length of time strongly depends on the stel-
lar mass because of the luminosity dependence of
the thermal time scale. A 15M⊙star condenses to
the main sequence in 60,000 years, whereas for
a 0.1M⊙star, the time is hundreds of millions of
years.
Some of the hydrogen burning reactions start
already at a few million degrees. For example,
lithium, beryllium and boron burn to helium in
the ppII and ppIII branches of the pp chain long
before the complete chain has turned on. Be-
cause the star is convective and thus well mixed
during the early stages, even its surface material
will have been processed in the centre. Although
the abundances of the above-mentioned elements
are small, they give important information on the
central temperature.
The beginning of the main sequence phase is
marked by the start of hydrogen burning in the pp
chain at a temperature of about 4 million degrees.
The new form of energy production completely
supersedes the energy release due to contraction.
As the contraction is halted, the star makes a few
oscillations in the HR diagram, but soon settles in
an equilibrium and the long, quiet main sequence
phase begins.
It is difﬁcult to observe stars during contrac-
tion, because the new-born stars are usually hid-
den among dense clouds of dust and gas. How-
ever, some condensations in interstellar clouds
have been discovered and near them, very young
stars. One example are the T Tauri stars. Their
lithium abundance is relatively high, which indi-
cates that they are newly formed stars in which
the central temperature has not yet become large
enough to destroy lithium. Near the T Tauri stars,

12.3
The Main Sequence Phase
267
small, bright, star-like nebulae, Herbig–Haro ob-
jects, have been discovered. These are thought to
be produced in the interaction between a stellar
wind and the surrounding interstellar medium.
12.3
The Main Sequence Phase
The main sequence phase is that evolutionary
stage in which the energy released by the burn-
ing of hydrogen in the core is the only source
of stellar energy. During this stage, the star is in
stable equilibrium, and its structure changes only
because its chemical composition is gradually al-
tered by the nuclear reactions. Thus the evolu-
tion takes place on a nuclear time scale, which
means that the main sequence phase is the longest
part of the life of a star. For example, for a so-
lar mass star, the main sequence phase lasts for
about 10,000 million years. More massive stars
evolve more rapidly, because they radiate much
more power. Thus the main sequence phase of
a 15 solar mass star is only about 10 million
years. On the other hand, less massive stars have
a longer main sequence lifetime: a 0.25M⊙star
spends about 70,000 million years on the main
sequence.
Since stars are most likely to be found in the
stage of steady hydrogen burning, the main se-
quence in the HR diagram is richly populated, in
particular at its low-mass end. The more massive
upper main sequence stars are less abundant be-
cause of their shorter main sequence lifetimes.
If the mass of a star becomes too large, the
force of gravity can no longer resist the radiation
pressure. Stars more massive than this upper limit
cannot form, because they cannot accrete addi-
tional mass during the contraction phase. Theo-
retical computations give a limiting mass of about
120M⊙; the most massive stars observed are
claimed to be about 150M⊙. These values are,
however, uncertain.
There is also a lower-mass limit of the main
sequence. Stars below 0.08M⊙never become hot
enough for hydrogen burning to begin. They can
still generate some luminosity from the burning
of deuterium, but this energy source is rapidly ex-
hausted. These brown dwarfs have surface tem-
peratures in the range of 1000–2000 K. Hundreds
of brown dwarfs have now been found in dedi-
cated surveys. The lower limit for brown dwarf
mass is sometimes taken to be about 0.015M⊙,
corresponding to the minimum mass for deu-
terium burning.
If the mass is even lower there are no nu-
clear sources of energy. The smallest protostars
therefore contract to planet-like dwarfs. During
the contraction phase they radiate because poten-
tial energy is released, but eventually they be-
gin to cool. In the HR diagram such stars ﬁrst
move almost vertically downwards and then fur-
ther downwards to the right.
Is there a difference between the lowest-mass
brown dwarfs and the most massive planets? If
brown dwarfs have formed by gravitational col-
lapse and fragmentation as described in the pre-
vious section and in Sect. 15.4, there is no rea-
son not to count them as stars, although they are
not producing energy by nuclear reactions. Plan-
ets in contrast are thought to form much more
slowly by the clumping of solids and accretion of
gas in a protoplanetary disk. The objects formed
by this mechanism start out with a quite differ-
ent structure. Whether such a clear-cut distinction
between the formation mechanisms of dark stars
and planets really can be made still remains an
open question.
The Upper Main Sequence
The stars on the
upper main sequence are so massive and their
central temperature so high that the CNO cycle
can operate. On the lower main sequence the en-
ergy is produced by the pp chain. The pp chain
and the CNO cycle are equally efﬁcient at a tem-
perature of 18 million degrees, corresponding to
the central temperature of a 1.5M⊙star. The
boundary between the upper and the lower main
sequence corresponds roughly to this mass.
The energy production in the CNO cycle is
very strongly concentrated at the core. The out-
ward energy ﬂux will then become very large,
and can no longer be maintained by radiative
transport. Thus the upper main sequence stars
have a convective core, i.e. the energy is trans-
ported by material motions. These keep the mate-
rial well mixed, and thus the hydrogen abundance
decreases uniformly with time within the entire
convective region.

Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 5,

Stothers, R. (1966):
Astrophys. J. 143, 91)
Outside the core, there is radiative equilib-
rium, i.e. the energy is carried by radiation and
there are no nuclear reactions. Between the core
and the envelope, there is a transition region
where the hydrogen abundance decreases in-
wards.
The mass of the convective core will gradu-
ally diminish as the hydrogen is consumed. In the
HR diagram the star will slowly shift to the upper
right as its luminosity grows and its surface tem-
perature decreases (Fig. 12.2). When the central
hydrogen supply becomes exhausted, the core of
the star will begin to shrink rapidly. The surface
temperature will increase and the star will quickly
move to the upper left. Because of the contraction
of the core, the temperature in the hydrogen shell
just outside the core will increase. It rapidly be-
comes high enough for hydrogen burning to set
in again.
The Lower Main Sequence
On the lower main
sequence, the central temperature is lower than
for massive stars, and the energy is generated by
the pp chain. Since the rate of the pp chain is not
as sensitive to temperature as that of the CNO cy-
cle, the energy production is spread over a larger
region than in the more massive stars (Fig. 12.3).
In consequence, the core never becomes convec-
tively unstable, but remains radiative.

12.4
The Giant Phase
269
In the outer layers of lower main sequence
stars, the opacity is high because of the low tem-
perature. Radiation can then no longer carry all
the energy, and convection will set in. The struc-
ture of lower main sequence stars is thus oppo-
site to that of the upper main sequence: the centre
is radiative and the envelope is convective. Since
there is no mixing of material in the core, the hy-
drogen is most rapidly consumed at the very cen-
tre, and the hydrogen abundance increases out-
wards.
As the amount of hydrogen in the core de-
creases, the star will slowly move upwards in
the HR diagram, almost along the main sequence
(Fig. 12.2). It becomes slightly brighter and hot-
ter, but its radius will not change by much. The
evolutionary track of the star will then bend to the
right, as hydrogen in the core nears its end. Even-
tually the core is almost pure helium. Hydrogen
will continue to burn in a thick shell around the
core.
Stars with masses between 0.08M⊙and
0.26M⊙have a very simple evolution. During
their whole main sequence phase they are fully
convective, which means that their entire hydro-
gen content is available as fuel. These stars evolve
very slowly toward the upper left in the HR dia-
gram. Finally, when all their hydrogen has burned
to helium, they contract to become white dwarfs.
12.4
The Giant Phase
The main-sequence phase of stellar evolution
ends when hydrogen is exhausted at the centre.
The star then settles in a state in which hydrogen
is burning in a shell surrounding a helium core.
As we have seen, the transition takes place grad-
ually in lower main-sequence stars, giving rise to
the Subgiant Branch in the HR diagram, while
the upper main-sequence stars make a rapid jump
at this point.
The mass of the helium core is increased by
the hydrogen burning in the shell. This leads to
the expansion of the envelope of the star, which
moves almost horizontally to the right in the HR
diagram. As the convective envelope becomes
more extensive, the star approaches the Hayashi
track. Since it cannot pass further to the right, and
since its radius continues to grow, the star has to
move upwards along the Hayashi track towards
larger luminosities (Fig. 12.2). The star has be-
come a red giant.
In low-mass stars (M ≤2.3M⊙), as the mass
of the core grows, its density will eventually be-
come so high that it becomes degenerate. The
central temperature will continue to rise. The
whole helium core will have a uniform temper-
ature because of the high conductivity of the de-
generate gas. If the mass of the star is larger than
0.26M⊙the central temperature will eventually
reach about 100 million degrees, which is enough
for helium to burn to carbon in the triple alpha
process.
Helium burning will set in simultaneously in
the whole central region and will suddenly raise
its temperature. Unlike a normal gas, the degener-
ate core cannot expand, although the temperature
increases (cf. (11.16)), and therefore the increase
in temperature will only lead to a further accel-
eration of the rate of the nuclear reactions. When
the temperature increases further, the degeneracy
of the gas is removed and the core will begin to
expand violently. Only a few seconds after the ig-
nition of helium, there is an explosion, the helium
ﬂash.
The energy from the helium ﬂash is absorbed
by the outer layers, and thus it does not lead to
the complete disruption of the star. In fact the lu-
minosity of the star drops in the ﬂash, because
when the centre expands, the outer layers con-
tract. The energy released in the ﬂash is turned
into potential energy of the expanded core. Thus
after the helium ﬂash, the star settles into a new
state, where helium is steadily burning to carbon
in a nondegenerate core.
After the helium ﬂash the star ﬁnds itself on
the horizontal giant branch in the HR diagram.
The exact position of a star on the horizontal
branch after the helium ﬂash is a sensitive func-
tion of its envelope mass. This in turn depends
on the amount of mass lost by the star in the he-
lium ﬂash, which can vary randomly from star
to star. While the luminosity does not vary much
along the horizontal branch, the effective temper-
atures are higher for stars with less mass in the
envelope. The horizontal branch is divided into

270
12
Stellar Evolution
a blue and a red part by a gap corresponding to
the pulsational instability leading to RR Lyrae
variables (see Sect. 14.2). The form of the hori-
zontal branch for a collection of stars depends on
their metal-abundance, in the sense that a lower
metal abundance is related to a more prominent
blue horizontal branch. Thus the blue horizon-
tal branch in globular clusters with low metal-
abundances is strong and prominent (Sect. 16.3).
For stars with solar element abundances the hori-
zontal branch is reduced to a short stump, the red
clump, where it joins the red giant branch.
In intermediate-mass stars (2.3M⊙≤M ≤
8M⊙), the central temperature is higher and the
central density lower, and the core will therefore
not be degenerate. Thus helium burning can set in
non-catastrophically as the central regions con-
tract. As the importance of the helium burning
core increases, the star ﬁrst moves away from
the red giant branch towards bluer colours, but
then loops back towards the Hayashi track again.
An important consequence of these blue loops
is that they bring the star into the strip in the
HR diagram corresponding to the cepheid insta-
bility (Sect. 14.2). This gives rise to the classi-
cal cepheid variables, which are of central impor-
tance for determining distances in the Milky Way
and to the nearest galaxies.
In the most massive stars helium burning starts
before the star has had time to reach the red giant
branch. Some stars will continue moving to the
right in the HR diagram. For others this will pro-
duce a massive stellar wind and a large mass loss.
Stars in this evolutionary phase, such as P Cygni
and η Carinae, are known as luminous blue vari-
ables, LBV, and are among the brightest in the
Milky Way. If the star can retain its envelope it
will become a red supergiant. Otherwise it will
turn back towards the blue side of the HR dia-
gram, ending up as a Wolf–Rayet star.
The Asymptotic Giant Branch
The evolu-
tion that follows core helium burning depends
strongly on the stellar mass. The mass determines
how high the central temperature can become and
the degree of degeneracy when heavier nuclear
fuels are ignited.
When the central helium supply is exhausted,
helium will continue to burn in a shell, while
the hydrogen burning shell is extinguished. In the
HR diagram the star will move towards lower ef-
fective temperature and higher luminosity. This
phase is quite similar to the previous red giant
phase of low-mass stars, although the temper-
atures are slightly hotter. For this reason it is
known as the asymptotic giant branch, AGB.
After the early phase, when the helium shell
catches up with the extinguished hydrogen shell,
the AGB star enters what is known as the ther-
mally pulsing phase, where hydrogen and helium
shell burning alternate. A conﬁguration with two
burning shells is unstable, and in this phase the
stellar material may become mixed or matter may
be ejected into space in a shell, like that of a plan-
etary nebula.
The thermally pulsing AGB continues until ra-
diation pressure has led to the complete expul-
sion of the outer layers into a planetary nebula.
Low- and intermediate-mass giants (M ≤8M⊙)
never become hot enough to ignite carbon burn-
ing in the core, which remains as a carbon–
oxygen white dwarf (Fig. 12.6).
The End of the Giant Phase
After the end of
helium burning the evolution of a star changes
character. This is because the nuclear time scale
at the centre becomes short compared to the ther-
mal time scale of the outer layers. Secondly,
the energy released in nuclear reactions will be
carried away by neutrinos, instead of being de-
posited at the centre. In consequence, while the
thermonuclear burning follows the same pattern
as hydrogen and helium burning, the star as a
whole does not have time to react immediately.
In stars with masses around 10M⊙either car-
bon or oxygen may be ignited explosively just
like helium in low-mass stars: there is a carbon
or oxygen ﬂash. This is much more powerful than
the helium ﬂash, and may make the star explode
as a supernova (Sects. 12.5 and 13.3).
For even larger masses the core remains non-
degenerate and burning will start non-catastro-
phically as the core goes on contracting and
becoming hotter. First carbon burning and sub-
sequently
oxygen
and
silicon
burning
(see
Sect. 10.3) will be ignited. As each nuclear fuel

is exhausted in the centre, the burning will con-
tinue in a shell. The star will thus contain sev-
eral nuclear burning shells. At the end the star
will consist of a sequence of layers differing in
composition, in massive stars (more massive than
15M⊙) all the way up to iron.
The central parts of the most massive stars
with masses larger than 15M⊙burn all the way
to iron 56Fe. All nuclear sources of energy will
then be completely exhausted. The structure of
a 30 solar mass star at this stage is schemati-
cally shown in Fig. 12.4. The star is made up
of a nested sequence of zones bounded by shells
burning silicon 28Si, oxygen 16O and carbon 12C,
helium 4He and hydrogen 1H. However, this is
not a stable state, since the end of nuclear re-
actions in the core means that the central pres-
sure will fall, and the core will collapse. Some
of the energy released in the collapse goes into
dissociating the iron nuclei ﬁrst to helium and
then to protons and neutrons. This will further
speed up the collapse, just like the dissociation
of molecules speeds up the collapse of a pro-
tostar. The collapse takes place on a dynamical
time scale, which, in the dense stellar core, is
only a fraction of a second. The outer parts will
also collapse, but more slowly. In consequence,
the temperature will increase in layers contain-
ing unburnt nuclear fuel. This will burn explo-
sively, releasing immense amounts of energy in
a few seconds, principally in the form of neutri-
nos.
The ﬁnal stages of stellar evolution may be
described as an implosion of the core, which is
brieﬂy halted every time a new source of nu-
clear fuel becomes available for burning It is still
an open problem how exactly the energy released
in this collapse is transformed into the disrup-
tion of the entire star and the ejection of its outer
layers. It is also still unclear whether in a given
case the remnant will be a neutron star or a black
hole.
Although the exact mechanism is not yet un-
derstood, the end-point of the evolution of stars
more massive the about 8M⊙is that the outer
layers explode as a supernova. In the dense cen-
tral core, the protons and electrons combine to
form neutrons. The core will ﬁnally consist al-
most entirely of neutrons, which become degen-
erate because of the high density. The degeneracy
pressure of the neutrons will stop the collapse of
a small mass core. However, if the mass of the
core is large enough, a black hole will probably
be formed.
12.5
The Final Stages of Evolution
The endpoints of stellar evolution can be seen
from Fig. 12.7. This shows the relation between
mass and central density for a body at zero tem-
perature, i.e. the ﬁnal equilibrium when a mas-
sive body has cooled. There are two maxima
on the curve. The mass corresponding to the
left-hand maximum is called the Chandrasekhar
mass, MCh ≈1.2–1.4M⊙, and that correspond-
ing to the right-hand one, the Oppenheimer–
Volkoff mass, MOV ≈1.5–2M⊙.
Let us ﬁrst consider a star with mass less than
MCh. Suppose the mass does not change. When
the nuclear fuel is exhausted, the star will become
a white dwarf, which will gradually cool down
and contract. In Fig. 12.5 it moves horizontally
to the right. Finally it will reach zero tempera-
ture and end up on the left-hand rising part of the
equilibrium curve. Its ﬁnal equilibrium is a com-
pletely degenerate black dwarf.
If the mass of the star is larger than MCh but
smaller than MOV, it can continue cooling until it
reaches the right-hand rising section of the curve.
Again there is a stable ﬁnal state, this time corre-
sponding to a completely degenerate neutron star.
An even more massive star with mass larger
than MOV will go on contracting past the den-

272
12
Stellar Evolution
sity corresponding to a neutron star. There is
then no longer any known possible stable equi-
librium, and the star must go on contracting to
form a black hole.
The only endpoints of stellar evolution pre-
dicted by theory are the two stable states of
Fig. 12.7 and the two extreme possibilities, col-
lapse to a black hole or explosive disruption.

evolutionary stage. The star consists of layers with differ-
ent composition separated by nuclear burning shells
The preceding considerations are purely theo-
retical. The ﬁnal evolutionary stages of real stars
involve many imperfectly known factors, which
may affect the ﬁnal equilibrium. Perhaps most
important is the question of mass loss, which is
very difﬁcult to settle either observationally or
theoretically. For example, in a supernova explo-
sion the whole star may be disrupted and it is very
uncertain whether what remains will be a neutron
star, a black hole or nothing at all. (The structure
of compact stars will be discussed in Chap. 15.)
A summary of the various evolutionary paths
is given in Fig. 12.8.
12.6
The Evolution of Close Binary
Stars
If the components of a binary star are well sep-
arated, they do not signiﬁcantly perturb one an-
other. When studying their evolution, one can re-
gard them as two single stars evolving indepen-
dently, as described above. However, in close bi-
nary pairs, this will no longer be the case.
Close binary stars are divided into three
classes, as shown in Fig. 12.9: detached, semide-
tached and contact binaries. The ﬁgure-eight

Fig. 12.7 The evolutionary end points of stars with dif-
ferent masses shown as a function of central density. The
curve shows the behaviour of the central density of com-
pletely degenerate (T = 0 K) bodies. The Chandrasekhar
mass MCh and the Oppenheimer–Volkoff mass MOV cor-
respond to maxima on this curve
curve drawn in the ﬁgure is an equipotential sur-
face called the Roche surface. If the star becomes
larger than this surface, it begins to lose mass to
its companion through the waist of the Roche sur-
face.
During the main sequence phase the stellar ra-
dius does not change much, and each component
will remain within its own Roche lobe. When
the hydrogen is exhausted, the stellar core will
rapidly shrink and the outer layers expand, as we
have seen. At this stage a star may exceed its
Roche lobe and mass transfer may set in.
Close binary stars are usually seen as eclipsing
binaries. One example is Algol in the constella-
tion Perseus. The components in this binary sys-
tem are a normal main sequence star and a sub-
giant, which is much less massive than the main
sequence star. The subgiant has a high luminos-
ity and thus has apparently already left the main
sequence. This is unexpected, since the compo-
nents were presumably formed at the same time,
and the more massive star should evolve more
rapidly. The situation is known as the Algol para-
dox: for some reason, the less massive star has
evolved more rapidly.
In the 1950’s a solution to the paradox pro-
posed that the subgiant was originally more mas-
sive, but that it had lost mass to its companion
during its evolution. Since the 1960’s mass trans-
fer in close binary systems has been much stud-
ied, and has turned out be a very signiﬁcant factor
in the evolution of close binaries.
As an example, let us consider a close binary,
where the initial masses of the components are
1 and 2 solar masses and the initial orbital pe-
riod 1.4 days (Fig. 12.10). After evolving away
from the main sequence the more massive com-
ponent will exceed the Roche limit and begin to
lose mass to its companion. Initially the mass will
be transferred on the thermal time scale, and after
a few million years the roles of the components
will be changed: the initially more massive com-
ponent has become less massive than its compan-
ion.
The binary is now semidetached and can be
observed as an Algol-type eclipsing binary. The
two components are a more massive main se-
quence star and a less massive subgiant ﬁlling its
Roche surface. The mass transfer will continue,
but on the much slower nuclear time scale. Fi-
nally, mass transfer will cease and the less mas-
sive component will contract to a 0.6M⊙white
dwarf.
The more massive 2.4M⊙star now evolves
and begins to lose mass, which will accumulate
on the surface of the white dwarf. The accumu-
lated mass may give rise to nova outbursts, where
material is ejected into space by large explosions.
Despite this, the mass of the white dwarf will
gradually grow and may eventually exceed the
Chandrasekhar mass. The white dwarf will then
collapse and explode as a type I supernova.
As a second example, we can take a massive
binary with the initial masses 20 and 8M⊙and
the initial period 4.7 days (Fig. 12.11). The more
massive component evolves rapidly, and at the
end of the main sequence phase, it will transfer
more than 15M⊙of its material to the secondary.
The mass transfer will occur on the thermal time
scale, which, in this case, is only a few ten thou-
sand years. The end result is a helium star, having
as a companion an unevolved main sequence star.
The properties of the helium star are like those of
a Wolf–Rayet star (Fig. 12.12).
Helium continues to burn to carbon in the core
of the helium star, and the mass of the carbon core
will grow. Eventually the carbon will be explo-
sively ignited, and the star will explode as a su-

Stellar Evolution
Fig. 12.8 Evolution schemes for stars with different
masses. The radius is scaled to be the same in all draw-
ings. In reality, there are vast differences in the sizes of
different stars and different phases of evolution. In the be-
ginning (1) a gas cloud is contracting rapidly in free fall.
Because the gas is quite rareﬁed, radiation escapes easily
from the cloud. As the density increases, radiation trans-
port becomes more difﬁcult, and the released energy tends
to warm up the gas. The contraction lasts until the gas is
completely ionised, and the star, which has become a pro-
tostar, is in hydrostatic equilibrium (2). The star is convec-
tive throughout its interior.
Now evolution continues on a thermal time scale. The con-
traction is much slower than in the free-fall phase. The
phases of further evolution are determined by the mass M
of the star. For M < 0.08M⊙the temperature in the cen-
tre does not rise high enough for hydrogen burning, and
these stars contract to planetlike brown dwarfs. Stars with
M ≥0.08M⊙start hydrogen burning when the tempera-
ture has reached about 4 × 106 K. This is the beginning
of the main sequence phase. In the main sequence, the
lowest-mass stars with 0.08M⊙≤M ≤0.26M⊙are en-
tirely convective, and thus they remain homogeneous (3).
Their evolution is very slow, and after all the hydrogen has
been burnt to helium, they contract to white dwarfs (4).
The increasing temperature makes the stars with M >
0.26M⊙radiative in the centre as the opacity de-
creases (5). The low-mass stars with 0.26M⊙≤M ≤
1.5M⊙remain radiative in the centre during the main
sequence phase (6) as they burn their hydrogen through
the pp chain. The outer part is convective. At the end of
the main sequence phase, hydrogen burning continues in
a shell surrounding the helium core (7).
The outer part expands, and the giant phase begins. The
contracting helium core is degenerate and warms up. At
about 108 K, the triple alpha process begins and leads im-
mediately to the helium ﬂash (8). The explosion is damped
by the outer parts, and helium burning goes on in the
core (9). Hydrogen is still burning in an outer shell. As the
central helium is exhausted, helium burning moves over to
a shell (10). At the same time, the outer part expands and
the star loses some of its mass. The expanding envelope
forms a planetary nebula (11). The star in the centre of the
nebula becomes a white dwarf (12).
In the upper main sequence with M ≥1.5M⊙energy is
released through the CNO cycle, and the core becomes
convective, while the outer part is radiative (13). The main
sequence phase ends as the hydrogen in the core is ex-
hausted, and shell burning begins (14). The helium core
remains convective and nondegenerate, and helium burn-
ing begins without perturbations (15 and 19). Afterwards,
helium burning moves over to a shell (16 and 20). For
stars with 3M⊙≤M ≤15M⊙the carbon in the core is
degenerate, and a carbon ﬂash occurs (17). This leads to
a supernova explosion (18) and possibly to the complete
destruction of the star.
For the most massive stars with M ≥15M⊙the carbon
core remains convective, and carbon burns to oxygen and
magnesium. Finally, the star consists of an iron core sur-
rounded by shells with silicon, oxygen, carbon, helium
and hydrogen (21). The nuclear fuel is now exhausted, and
the star collapses on a dynamical time scale. The result is
a supernova (22). The outer parts explode, but the remain-
ing core continues to contract to a neutron star or a black
hole

pernova. The consequences of this explosion are
not known, but let us suppose that a 2M⊙com-
pact remnant is left. As the more massive star ex-
pands, its stellar wind will become stronger, giv-
ing rise to strong X-ray emission as it hits the
compact star. This X-ray emission will only cease
when the more massive star exceeds its Roche
surface.
The system will now rapidly lose mass and
angular momentum. A steady state is ﬁnally
reached when the system contains a 6M⊙helium
star in addition to the 2M⊙compact star. The
helium star is seen as a Wolf–Rayet star, which,
after about a million years, explodes as a super-
nova. This will probably lead to the breakup of
the binary system. However, for certain values
of the mass, the binary may remain bound. Thus
a binary neutron star may be formed.
12.7
Comparison with Observations
The most important direct support for the theo-
retical evolutionary models is obtained from the
properties of observed HR diagrams. If the the-
oretical models are correct, the observed number
of stars should reﬂect the duration of the various
evolutionary phases. These are given for stars of
different masses in Table 12.1. The stars are most
numerous along the main sequence. Giants are
also common and, in addition to these, there are
white dwarfs, subgiants, etc. The sparsely popu-
lated region to the right of the main sequence, the

276
12
Stellar Evolution
Hertzsprung gap, is explained by the rapid tran-
sition from the main sequence to the giant phase.
The cepheids provide an important test for
the evolutionary models. The pulsations and the
relation between period and luminosity for the
cepheids can be understood on the basis of the-
oretical stellar models.
The evolutionary models can also explain the
HR diagrams of star clusters. Let us assume that
all the stars in a cluster were formed at the same
time. In the youngest systems, the associations,
the stars will mainly be found on the upper main

still contracting. In intermediate age open clus-
ters, the main sequence will be well developed
and its upper end should bend to the right, since
the most massive stars will already have begun to
evolve off the main sequence. In the old globular
clusters, the giant branch should increase in im-
portance in the older clusters. These predictions
are conﬁrmed by the observations, which will be
further discussed in Chap. 16 on star clusters.
Of course, the most detailed observations can
be made of the Sun, which is therefore a crucial
point of comparison for the theoretical models.
If a star of one solar mass with an initial com-
position of 71 % hydrogen, 27 % helium and
2 % heavier elements is allowed to evolve for
5000 million years, it will be very similar to our
present Sun. In particular, it will have the same
radius, surface temperature and luminosity. Ac-
cording to calculations, about half of the Sun’s
supply of hydrogen fuel has been consumed. The
Sun will go on shining like a normal main se-
quence star for another 5000 million years, before
there will be any dramatic change.
Some problems remain in regard to the obser-
vations. One is the solar neutrino problem. The
neutrinos produced by solar nuclear reactions
have been observed since the beginning of the
1970’s by the techniques described in Sect. 3.7.
Only the neutrinos formed in the relatively rare
ppIII reaction are energetic enough to be ob-
served in this way. Their observed number is too
small: whereas the models predict about 5 units,
the observations have consistently only registered
1–2.
The discrepancy may be due to a fault in
the observational technique or to some unknown
properties of the neutrinos. However, if the solar
models are really in error, the central temperature
of the Sun would have to be about 20 % lower
than thought, which would be in serious conﬂict
with the observed solar luminosity. One possibil-
ity is that some of the electron neutrinos change
to other, unobservable particles during their pas-
sage to Earth. (See also Sect. 12.1.)
A second problem is the observed abundance
of lithium and beryllium. The solar surface con-
tains a normal abundance of beryllium, but very
little lithium. This should mean that during its
contraction, the Sun was still fully convective
when the central temperature was high enough
to destroy lithium (3 × 106 K), but not beryl-
lium (4×106 K). However, according to the stan-
dard solar evolution models, convection ceased in
the centre already at a temperature of 2 × 106 K.
One suggested explanation is that the convection
has later carried down lithium to layers where the
temperature is high enough to destroy it.
12.8
The Origin of the Elements
There are just under a hundred naturally occur-
ring elements, and about 300 isotopes in the solar
system (Fig. 12.13). In Sect. 12.4, we have seen
how the elements up to iron are produced when
hydrogen burns to helium and helium further to
carbon, oxygen and heavier elements.
Almost all nuclei heavier than helium were
produced in nuclear reactions in stellar interiors.
In the oldest stars, the mass fraction of heavy
elements is only about 0.02 %, whereas in the
youngest stars it is a few per cent. Neverthe-
less, most of the stellar material is hydrogen and

abundances in the solar
system as a function of the
nuclear mass number. The
abundance of Si has been
normalised as 106
helium. According to the standard cosmological
model, those were formed in the early stages of
the Universe, when the temperature and density
were suitable for nuclear reactions. (This will be
discussed in Chap. 20.) Although helium is pro-
duced during the main sequence stellar evolution,
very little of it is actually returned into space to be
incorporated into later stellar generations. Most
of it is either transformed into heavier elements
by further reactions, or else remains locked up in-
side white dwarf remnants. Therefore the helium
abundance does not increase by much due to stel-
lar processes.
The most important nuclear reactions leading
to the build-up of the heavy nuclei up to iron were
presented in Sect. 11.3. The probabilities of the
various reactions are determined either by exper-
iments or by theoretical calculations. When they
are known, the relative abundances of the various
nuclei produced can be calculated.
The formation of elements heavier than iron
requires an input of energy, and thus they cannot
be explained in the same manner. Still heavy nu-
clei are continually produced. In 1952 technetium
was discovered in the atmosphere of a red giant.
The half-life of the most longlived isotope 98Tc is
about 1.5 × 106 years, so that the observed tech-
netium must have been produced in the star.
Most of the nuclei more massive than iron are
formed by neutron capture (Fig. 12.14). Since
the neutron does not have an electric charge, it
can easily penetrate into the nucleus. The prob-
ability for neutron capture depends both on the
kinetic energy of the incoming neutron and on
the mass number of the nucleus. For example, in
the solar system the abundances of isotopes show
maxima at the mass numbers A = 70–90, 130,

12.8

Fig. 12.14 Neutron capture paths for the s-process and
r-process (from left to right). The s-process follows a path
along the line of beta stability. The stable r-process nuclei
(small circles) result from beta decay of their neutron rich
progenitors on the shaded path shown lower. Beta decay
occurs along straight lines A = const. The closed neutron
shells in nuclei at N = 50, 82 and 126 correspond to abun-
dance peaks in s-process nuclei at A = 88, 138 and 208,
and in r-process nuclei at A = 80, 130 and 195. (Seeger,
P.A., Fowler, W.A., Clayton, D.D. (1965): Astrophys. J.
Suppl. 11, 121)
138, 195 and 208. These mass numbers cor-
respond to nuclei with closed neutron shells at
the neutron numbers N = 50, 82, and 126. The
neutron capture probability for these nuclei is
very small. The closed shell nuclei thus react
more slowly and are accumulated in greater abun-
dances.
In a neutron capture, a nucleus with mass
number A is transformed into a more massive nu-
cleus:
(Z,A) + n →(Z,A + 1) + γ.
The newly formed nucleus may be unstable to
β decay, where one neutron is transformed into
a proton:
(Z,A + 1) →(Z + 1,A + 1) + e−+ νe.
Two kinds of neutron capture processes are en-
countered, depending on the value of the neutron
ﬂux. In the slow s-process, the neutron ﬂux is
so small that any β decays have had time to oc-
cur before the next neutron capture reaction takes
place. The most stable nuclei up to mass num-
ber 210 are formed by the s-process. These nu-
clei are said to correspond to the β stability val-
ley. The s-process explains the abundance peaks
at the mass numbers 88, 138 and 208.
When the neutron ﬂux is large, β decays do
not have time to happen before the next neu-
tron capture. One then speaks of the rapid r-
process, which gives rise to more neutron-rich
isotopes. The abundance maxima produced by
the r-process lie at mass numbers about ten units
smaller than those of the s-process.
A neutron ﬂux sufﬁcient for the s-process is
obtained in the course of normal stellar evolu-
tion. For example, some of the carbon and oxy-
gen burning reactions produce free neutrons. If
there is convection between the hydrogen and he-
lium burning shells, free protons may be carried
into the carbon-rich layers. Then the following
neutron-producing reaction chain becomes im-

280
12
Stellar Evolution
portant:
12C + p
→13N + γ,
13N
→13C + e+ + νe,
13C +4 He →16O + n.
The convection can also carry the reaction prod-
ucts nearer to the surface.
The neutron ﬂux required for the r-process
is about 1022 cm−3, which is too large to be
produced during normal stellar evolution. The
only presently known site where a large enough
neutron ﬂux is expected is near a neutron star
forming in a supernova explosion. In this case,
the rapid neutron capture leads to nuclei that
cannot capture more neutrons without becoming
strongly unstable. After one or more rapid β de-
cays, the process continues.
The r-process stops when the neutron ﬂux de-
creases. The nuclei produced then gradually de-
cay by the β-process towards more stable iso-
topes. Since the path of the r-process goes about
ten mass units below the stability valley, the abun-
dance peaks produced will fall about ten units
below those of the s-process. This is shown in
Fig. 12.11. The most massive naturally occurring
elements, such as uranium, thorium and pluto-
nium, are formed by the r-process.
There are about 40 isotopes on the proton-rich
side of the β stability valley that cannot be pro-
duced by neutron capture processes. Their abun-
dances are very small, relative to the neighbour-
ing isotopes. They are formed in supernova ex-
plosions at temperatures higher than 109 K by re-
actions known as the p-process. At this tempera-
ture, pair formation can take place:
γ →e+ + e−.
The positron may either be annihilated immedi-
ately or be consumed in the reaction
e+ + (Z,A) →(Z + 1,A) + νe.
Another reaction in the p-process is
(Z,A) + p →(Z + 1,A + 1) + γ.
Finally, the ﬁssion of some heavier isotopes may
give rise to p-process nuclei. Examples of this are
the isotopes 184W, 190Pt and 196Hg formed by the
ﬁssion of lead.
All the preceding reaction products are ejected
into the interstellar medium in the supernova
explosion. Collisions between cosmic rays and
heavy nuclei then ﬁnally give rise to the light el-
ements lithium, beryllium and boron. Thus the
abundances of essentially all naturally occurring
isotopes can be explained.
During succeeding generations of stars the rel-
ative abundance of heavy elements increases in
the interstellar medium. They can then be incor-
porated into new stars, planets—and living be-
ings.

This is several orders of magnitude shorter than
the actual period. Somehow the star has to get rid
of most of its angular momentum during the pro-
cess.
12.10 Exercises
Exercise 12.1
Find the free fall time scale for
a hydrogen cloud, if the density of H2 molecules
is 3000 cm−3. Assume that stars condense from
such clouds, there are 100 clouds in the Galaxy,
the mass of each cloud is 5 × 104M⊙, and 10 %
of the mass is converted into stars. Also assume
that the average mass of a star is 1M⊙. How
many stars are born in one year?
Exercise 12.2 The mass of Vega (spectral class
A0 V) is 2M⊙, radius 3R⊙, and luminosity
60L⊙. Find its thermal and nuclear time scales.
Exercise 12.3
Assume that a star remains 109
years in the main sequence and burns 10 % of its
hydrogen. Then the star will expand into a red gi-
ant, and its luminosity will increase by a factor
of 100. How long is the red giant stage, if we as-
sume that the energy is produced only by burning
the remaining hydrogen?

The Sun
The Sun is our nearest star. It is important for
astronomy because many phenomena which can
only be studied indirectly in other stars can be di-
rectly observed in the Sun (e.g. stellar rotation,
starspots, the structure of the stellar surface). Our
present picture of the Sun is based both on ob-
servations and on theoretical calculations. Some
observations of the Sun disagree with the theoret-
ical solar models. The details of the models will
have to be changed, but the general picture should
remain valid.

four million tonnes of mass into energy every
second. The mass of the Sun is so large, about
330,000 times that of the Earth, that during the
whole main sequence lifetime of the Sun less than
0.1 % of its mass is turned into energy.
When the Sun formed about 5000 million
years ago, its composition was the same every-
where as its present surface composition. Since
energy production is concentrated at the very cen-
tre, hydrogen is consumed most rapidly there. At
about a quarter of the radius the hydrogen abun-
dance is still the same as in the surface layers,
but going inwards from that point it rapidly de-
creases. In the central core only 40 % of the ma-
terial is hydrogen. About 5 % of the hydrogen in
the Sun has been turned into helium.
The radiative central part of the Sun extends
to about 70 % of the radius. At that radius the
temperature has dropped so much that the gas
is no longer completely ionised. The opacity of
the solar material then strongly increases, inhibit-
ing the propagation of radiation. In consequence,
convection becomes a more efﬁcient means of en-
ergy transport. Thus the Sun has a convective en-
velope (Fig. 13.2).
The Solar Neutrino Problem
The central nu-
clear reactions produce neutrinos at several of the
steps in the pp chain (see Fig. 11.5). These neutri-
nos can propagate freely through the outer layers,
and thus give direct information about conditions
near the centre of the Sun. When neutrinos from
the Sun were ﬁrst observed in the 1970’s, their
number was found to be only about a third of
what was predicted. This disagreement is called
the solar neutrino problem.
In the ﬁrst experiments only neutrinos from
the ppII and ppIII branches were observed
(Sect. 11.3). Since only a small fraction of the
solar luminosity is produced in these reactions,
it was not clear what were the consequences
of these results for solar models. In the 1990’s

13.1
Internal Structure
285
neutrinos produced in the ppI branch, the main
branch of the pp chain, were observed. Although
the disagreement with the standard models was
slightly smaller in these observations (about 60 %
of the predicted ﬂux was observed), the neutrino
problem still remained.
Perhaps the most popular explanation for the
solar neutrino problem was based on neutrino
oscillations. According to this explanation, if
neutrinos have a small mass (about 10−2 eV),
an electron neutrino could change into a μ or
a τ neutrino as it passed through the outer parts
of the Sun. In the early experiments only electron
neutrinos were observed, representing only part
of the total number of neutrinos produced.
In 2001 the Canadian Sudbury neutrino obser-
vatory (SNO) announced results that seemed to
solve the problem. The SNO can detect the ﬂux of
all different neutrinos and the fraction of the elec-
tron neutrinos. The measurements showed that
the total neutrino ﬂux was indeed consistent with
the predictions of the solar models, but only 35 %
of the ﬂux consisted of electron neutrinos. Thus
65 % of the solar electron neutrinos had changed
to μ or τ neutrinos while travelling from the Sun
to the Earth. Similar observations were also made
in a Japanese neutrino observatory. Among the
pioneers of the neutrino astronomy are Raymond
Davis and Masatoshi Koshiba who shared the No-
bel prize in physics in 2002.
The solar neutrino problem can now be con-
sidered to be solved. The solution is a great suc-
cess for the standard solar model. But it has also
revealed the existence of neutrino oscillations,
proving that neutrinos have a small but non-zero
rest mass. This shows that the standard model of
particle physics needs to be revised in some re-
spects.
The Solar Rotation
As soon as telescopes
were introduced, it was observed from the mo-
tions of sunspots that the Sun is rotating with
a rotational period of about 27 days. As early as
1630 Christoph Scheiner showed that there was
differential rotation: the rotational period near the
poles was more than 30 days, while it was only
25 days at the equator. The rotational axis of the
Sun is inclined at 7◦with respect to the plane of
the ecliptic, so that the North Pole of the Sun is
best visible from the Earth in September.
The motions of sunspots still give the best in-
formation on the rotation near the surface of the
Sun. Other surface features also have been used
for this purpose. The rotational velocity has also
been measured directly from the Doppler effect.
The angular velocity is usually written
Ω = A −B sin2 ψ,
(13.1)
where ψ is the latitude with respect to the equa-
tor. The measured values of the coefﬁcients are
A = 14.5 and B = 2.9 degrees/day.
The rotational velocity deeper down in the
Sun cannot be directly observed. In the 1980’s
a method to estimate the rotation in the interior
became available, when it became possible to
measure the frequencies of solar oscillations from
the variations in spectral lines. These oscillations
are essentially sound waves produced by turbu-
lent gas motions in the convection zone. These
sound waves have calculable oscillation periods
(about 3–12 minutes), which depend on the con-
ditions in the solar interior. By comparing the ob-
served and theoretical values one can get infor-
mation about the conditions deep inside the Sun.
The idea of the method is the same as that used
when studying the interior of the Earth by means
of waves from earthquakes, and it is therefore
called helioseismology.
Using helioseismology, models for the so-
lar rotation throughout the convection zone have
been deduced. It appears that the angular velocity
in the whole convection zone is almost the same
as at the surface, although it decreases slightly
with radius near the equator, and increases near
the poles. The angular velocity of the radiative
core is still uncertain, but there are indications
that the core is rotating as a solid body with ap-
proximately the average surface angular velocity.
At the bottom of the convection zone there is a
thin layer known as the tachocline, where the an-
gular velocity changes rapidly with radius. The
internal solar rotation according to the helioseis-
mological studies is shown in Fig. 13.3.

286
13
The Sun
The solar differential rotation is maintained by
gas motions in the convection zone. Explaining
the observed behaviour is a difﬁcult problem that
is not yet completely understood.
13.2
The Atmosphere
The solar atmosphere is divided into the photo-
sphere and the chromosphere. Outside the actual
atmosphere, the corona extends much further out-
wards.
The Photosphere
The innermost layer of the
atmosphere is the photosphere, which is only
about 300–500 km thick. The photosphere is
the visible surface of the Sun, where the den-
sity rapidly increases inwards, hiding the interior
from sight. The temperature at the inner bound-
ary of the photosphere is 8000 K and at the outer
Fig. 13.3 The rotation rate of the Sun inferred from he-
lioseismological observations. The equator is at the hori-
zontal axis and the pole is at the vertical axis, both axes
being labelled by fractional radius. Some contours are la-
belled in nHz, and, for clarity, selected contours are shown
as bold. (430 nHz is about 26.9 days.) The dashed circle is
at the base of the convection zone and the tick marks at the
edge of the outer circle are at latitudes 15◦, 30◦, 45◦, 60◦,
75◦. The shaded area indicates the region in the Sun where
no reliable inference can be made with present data. The
slanted dotted lines are at an angle of 27◦with the rotation
axis. (Adapted from Schou et al. 1998.) (J. Christensen–
Dalsgaard 2007, astro-ph/0610942, Fig. 2)
boundary 4500 K. Near the edge of the solar
disk, the line of sight enters the photosphere at
a very small angle and never penetrates to large
depths. Near the edges one therefore only sees
light from the cooler, higher layers. For this rea-
son, the edges appear darker; this phenomenon
is known as limb darkening. Both the continuous
spectrum and the absorption lines are formed in
the photosphere, but the light in the absorption
lines comes from higher layers and therefore the
lines appear dark.
The solar convection is visible on the surface
as the granulation (Fig. 13.4), an uneven, con-
stantly changing granular pattern. At the bright
centre of each granule, gas is rising upward, and
at the darker granule boundaries, it is sinking
down again. The size of a granule seen from
the Earth is typically 1′′, corresponding to about
1000 km on the solar surface. There is also
a larger scale convection called supergranulation
in the photosphere. The cells of the supergranu-
lation may be about 1′ in diameter. The observed
velocities in the supergranulation are mainly di-
rected along the solar surface.
The Chromosphere
Outside the photosphere
there is a layer, perhaps about 500 km thick,
where the temperature increases from 4500 K to
about 6000 K, the chromosphere. Outside this
layer, there is a transition region of a few thou-
sand kilometres, where the chromosphere gradu-
ally goes over into the corona. In the outer parts
of the transition region, the kinetic temperature is
already about 106 K.
Normally the chromosphere is not visible, be-
cause its radiation is so much weaker than that
of the photosphere. However, during total solar
eclipses, the chromosphere shines into view for
a few seconds at both ends of the total phase,
when the Moon hides the photosphere com-
pletely. The chromosphere then appears as a thin
reddish sickle or ring.
During eclipses the chromospheric spectrum,
called the ﬂash spectrum, can be observed
(Fig. 13.5). It is an emission line spectrum with
more than 3000 identiﬁed lines. Brightest among
these are the lines of hydrogen, helium and cer-
tain metals.

lines
One of the strongest chromospheric emission
lines is the hydrogen Balmer α line (Fig. 13.6)
at a wavelength of 656.3 nm. Since the Hα line
in the normal solar spectrum is a very dark ab-
sorption line, a photograph taken at this wave-
length will show the solar chromosphere. For
this purpose, one uses narrow-band ﬁlters letting
through only the light in the Hα line. The re-
sulting pictures show the solar surface as a mot-
tled, wavy disk. The bright regions are usually
the size of a supergranule, and are bounded by
spicules (Fig. 13.7). These are ﬂamelike struc-
tures rising up to 10,000 km above the chromo-
sphere, and lasting for a few minutes. Against
the bright surface of the Sun, they look like
dark streaks; at the edges, they look like bright
ﬂames.
The Corona
The chromosphere gradually goes
over into the corona. The corona is also best seen
during total solar eclipses (Fig. 13.8). It then ap-
pears as a halo of light extending out to a few
solar radii. The surface brightness of the corona
is about that of the full moon, and it is therefore
difﬁcult to see next to the bright photosphere.
The inner part of the corona, the K corona,
has a continuous spectrum formed by the scatter-
ing of the photospheric light by electrons. Fur-

ther out, a few solar radii from the surface, is the
F corona, which has a spectrum showing Fraun-
hofer absorption lines. The light of the F corona
is sunlight scattered by dust.
In the latter part of the 19th century strong
emission lines, which did not correspond to those
of any known element, were discovered in the
corona (Fig. 13.9). It was thought that a new ele-
ment, called coronium, had been found—a little
earlier, helium had been discovered in the Sun
before it was known on Earth. About 1940, it
was established that the coronal lines were due to
highly ionised atoms, e.g. thirteen times ionised
iron. Much energy is needed to remove so many

Fig. 13.8 Previously, the
corona could be studied
only during total solar
eclipses. The picture is

March 7, 1970. Nowadays
the corona can be studied
continuously using
a device called the
coronagraph
Fig. 13.9 The presence of
lines from highly ionised
atoms in the coronal
spectrum shows that the
temperature of the corona
has to be very high
electrons from the atoms. The entire corona has
to have a temperature of about a million de-
grees.
A continuous supply of energy is needed in
order to maintain the high temperature of the
corona. According to earlier theories, the energy
came in the form of acoustic or magnetohydrody-
namic shock waves generated at the solar surface
by the convection. Most recently, heating by elec-
tric currents induced by changing magnetic ﬁelds
has been suggested. Heat would then be gener-
ated in the corona almost like in an ordinary light
bulb.
In spite of its high temperature the coronal gas
is so diffuse that the total energy stored in it is
small. It is constantly streaming outwards, gradu-
ally becoming a solar wind, which carries a ﬂux
of particles away from the Sun. The gas lost in

13.3
Solar Activity
Sunspots
The clearest visible sign of solar ac-
tivity are the sunspots. The existence of sunspots
has been known for long (Fig. 13.10), since the
largest ones can be seen with the naked eye by
looking at the Sun through a suitably dense layer
of fog. More precise observations became avail-
able beginning in the 17th century, when Galilei
started to use the telescope for astronomical ob-
servations.
A sunspot looks like a ragged hole in the solar
surface. In the interior of the spot there is a dark
umbra and around it, a less dark penumbra. By
looking at spots near the edge of the solar disk, it
can be seen that the spots are slightly depressed
with respect to the rest of the surface. The surface
temperature in a sunspot is about 1500 K below
that of its surroundings, which explains the dark
colour of the spots.
The diameter of a typical sunspot is about
10,000 km and its lifetime is from a few days to
several months, depending on its size. The larger
spots are more likely to be long-lived. Sunspots
often occur in pairs or in larger groups. By fol-
lowing the motions of the spots, the period of ro-
tation of the Sun can be determined.
The variations in the number of sunspots
have been followed for almost 250 years. The
frequency of spots is described by the Zürich
sunspot number Z:
Z = C(S + 10G),
(13.2)
where S is the number of spots and G the num-
ber of spot groups visible at a particular time. C is
a constant depending on the observer and the con-
ditions of observation.

sunspot number between the 18th century and

Fig. 13.11 The Zürich sunspot number from 1700 to 2001. Prior to 1700 there are only occasional observations. The
number of sunspots and spot groups varies with a period of about 11 years
Fig. 13.12 Left: During a sunspot maximum (Sept 27, 2001) the Sun is dotted by numerous spots. Right: Exactly seven
years later no spots are seen, although minimum phase should already be over. (Photos SOHO/MIDI)
the present are shown. Evidently the number of
spots varies with an average period of about
11 years. The actual period may be between 7
and 17 years. In the past decades, it has been
about 10.5 years. Usually the activity rises to its
maximum in about 3–4 years, and then falls off
slightly more slowly (Fig. 13.12). The period was
ﬁrst noted by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe in 1843.
The variations in the number of sunspots have
been fairly regular since the beginning of the
18th century. However, in the 17th century there
were long intervals when there were essentially
no spots at all. This quiescent period is called the
Maunder minimum. The similar Spörer minimum
occurred in the 15th century, and other quiet in-
tervals have been inferred at earlier epochs. The
mechanism behind these irregular variations in
solar activity is not yet understood.
The magnetic ﬁelds in sunspots are measured
on the basis of the Zeeman effect, and may be
as large as 0.45 tesla. (The magnetic ﬁeld of
the Earth at the equator is 0.03 mT.) The strong
magnetic ﬁeld inhibits convective energy trans-
port, which explains the lower temperature of the
spots.
Sunspots often occur in pairs where the com-
ponents have opposite polarity. The structure of
such bipolar groups can be understood if the ﬁeld
rises into a loop above the solar surface, connect-
ing the components of the pair. If gas is streaming
along such a loop, it becomes visible as a loop
prominence (Fig. 13.13).
The periodic variation in the number of sun-
spots reﬂects a variation in the general solar mag-
netic ﬁeld. At the beginning of a new activity cy-
cle spots ﬁrst begin to appear at latitudes of about

292

high latitudes. As the cycle

±40◦. As the cycle advances, the spots move
closer to the equator. The characteristic pattern
in which spots appear, shown in Fig. 13.14, is
known as the butterﬂy diagram. Spots of the next
cycle begin to appear while those of the old one
are still present near the equator. Spots belonging
to the new cycle have a polarity opposite to that
of the old ones. (Spots in opposite hemispheres
also have opposite polarity.) Since the ﬁeld is
thus reversed between consecutive 11 year cycles
the complete period of solar magnetic activity is
22 years.
The following general qualitative description
of the mechanism of the solar cycle was pro-
posed by Horace W. Babcock. Starting at a so-
lar minimum, the ﬁeld will be of a generally
dipolar character. Because a conducting medium,
such as the outer layers of the Sun, cannot move
across the ﬁeld lines, these will be frozen into the
plasma and carried along by it. Thus the differ-
ential rotation will draw the ﬁeld into a tight spi-
ral (Fig. 13.15). In the process the ﬁeld becomes
stronger, and this ampliﬁcation will be a function
of latitude.
When the subsurface ﬁeld becomes strong
enough, it gives rise to a “magnetic buoyancy”
that lifts ropes of magnetic ﬂux above the sur-
face. This happens ﬁrst at a latitude about 40◦,
and later at lower latitudes. These protruding ﬂux
ropes expand into loops forming bipolar groups
of spots. As the loops continue expanding they
make contact with the general dipolar ﬁeld, which
still remains in the polar regions. This leads to
a rapid reconnection of the ﬁeld lines neutralis-
ing the general ﬁeld. The ﬁnal result when ac-
tivity subsides is a dipolar ﬁeld with a polarity
opposite the initial one.

13.3
Solar Activity
293
Fig. 13.15 Because the Sun rotates faster at the equator than at the poles, the ﬁeld lines of the solar magnetic ﬁeld are
drawn out into a tight spiral

last sunspot minimum. Both pictures were taken by the
Michelson Doppler Imager on the SOHO satellite. On the
left the Sun in visible light, on the right a magnetogram,
which shows the opposite polarities of the magnetic ﬁelds
as black and white. (Photo SOHO/NASA/ESA)
Thus the Babcock model accounts for the but-
terﬂy diagram, the formation of bipolar magnetic
regions and the general ﬁeld reversal between ac-
tivity maxima. Nevertheless, it remains an essen-
tially phenomenological model, and alternative
scenarios have been proposed. In dynamo the-
ory quantitative models for the origin of mag-
netic ﬁelds in the Sun and other celestial bodies
are studied. In these models the ﬁeld is produced
by convection and differential rotation of the gas.
A completely satisfactory dynamo model for the
solar magnetic cycle has not yet been found. For
example, it is not yet known whether the ﬁeld is
produced everywhere in the convection zone, or
just in the boundary layer between the convective
and radiative regions, as some indications sug-
gest.
Other Activity
The Sun shows several other
types of surface activity: faculae and plages;
prominences; ﬂares.
The faculae and plages are local bright regions
in the photosphere and chromosphere, respec-
tively. Observations of the plages are made in the
hydrogen Hα or the calcium K lines (Fig. 13.16).
The plages usually occur where new sunspots
are forming, and disappear when the spots disap-
pear. Apparently they are caused by the enhanced
heating of the chromosphere in strong magnetic
ﬁelds.

The Sun
Fig. 13.17 (a) Quiescent “hedgerow” prominence. (Photograph Sacramento Peak Observatory.) (b) Larger eruptive
prominence. (Photograph Big Bear Solar Observatory)
The prominences are among the most spec-
tacular solar phenomena. They are glowing gas
masses in the corona, easily observed near the
edge of the Sun. There are several types of promi-
nences (Fig. 13.17): the quiescent prominences,
where the gas is slowly sinking along the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines; loop prominences, connected
with magnetic ﬁeld loops in sunspots; and the
rarer eruptive prominences, where gas is violently
thrown outwards.
The temperature of prominences is about
10,000–20,000 K. In Hα photographs of the chro-
mosphere, the prominences appear as dark ﬁla-
ments against the solar surface (Fig. 13.6).
The ﬂare outbursts are among the most violent
forms of solar activity (Fig. 13.18). They appear

13.3

as bright ﬂashes, lasting from one second to just
under an hour. In the ﬂares a large amount of en-
ergy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld is suddenly re-
leased. The detailed mechanism is not yet known.
Flares can be observed at all wavelengths. The
hard X-ray emission of the Sun may increase hun-
dredfold during a ﬂare. Several different types
of ﬂares are observed at radio wavelengths. The
emission of solar cosmic ray particles also rises.
Prominences and ﬂares are often accompa-
nied with coronal mass ejections Fast moving
(500–2000 km/s) clouds cause shock waves ac-
celerating particles to very high velocities. Parti-
cles in ﬂares are the fastest (v ≈0.3c). Particles in
a magnetic cloud travelling at the velocity of the
mass ejection reach the Earth in a couple of days.
Particles activated by the shock wave arrive con-
tinuously affecting the space weather and causing
magnetic storms.
The ﬂares and coronal mass ejections give rise
to disturbances on the Earth. The X-rays cause
changes in the ionosphere, which affect short-
wave radio communications. The particles give
rise to strong auroras when they enter the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld a few days after the outburst.
Solar Radio Emission
The Sun is the strongest
radio source in the sky and has been observed
Fig. 13.19 An X-ray picture of the active Sun, taken by
the Japanese Yohkoh satellite in 1999, around the last
maximum of sunspot activity. (Photo JAXA)
since the 1940’s. In contrast to optical emis-
sion the radio picture of the Sun shows a strong
limb brightening. This is because the radio ra-
diation comes from the upper layers of the at-
mosphere. Since the propagation of radio waves
is obstructed by free electrons, the high electron
density near the surface prevents radio radiation
from getting out. Shorter wavelengths can propa-

gate more easily, and thus millimetre-wavelength
observations give a picture of deeper layers in the
atmosphere, whereas the long wavelengths show
the upper layers. (The 10 cm emission originates
in the upper layers of the chromosphere and the
1 m emission, in the corona.)
The Sun looks different at different wave-
lengths. At long wavelengths the radiation is
coming from the largest area, and its electron
temperature is about 106 K, since it originates
in the corona.
The radio emission of the Sun is constantly
changing according to solar activity. During large
storms the total emission may be 100,000 times
higher than normal. Especially the motion of
shock waves can be followed by the radio emis-
sion, since the electrons accelerated by the shock
generate radio emission (type II radio bursts).
X-ray and UV Radiation
The X-ray emis-
sion of the Sun is also related to active regions
(Fig. 13.19). Signs of activity are bright X-ray re-
gions and smaller X-ray bright points, which last
for around ten hours. The inner solar corona also
emits X-rays. Near the solar poles there are coro-
nal holes, where the X-ray emission is weak.
Ultraviolet pictures of the solar surface show it
as much more irregular than it appears in visible
light. Most of the surface does not emit much UV
radiation, but there are large active regions that
are very bright in the ultraviolet.
Several satellites have made observations of
the Sun at UV and X-ray wavelengths, for ex-
ample Soho (Solar and Heliospheric Observa-
tory, 1995–, Fig. 13.20). These observations have
made possible detailed studies of the outer lay-
ers of the Sun. Observations of other stars have
revealed coronae, chromospheres and magnetic
variations similar to those in the Sun. Thus the
new observational techniques have brought the
physics of the Sun and the stars nearer to each
other.

Solar Wind and Space Weather

tions are considered as “disturbances”. Around a
minimum mass ejections may occur a few times
a week; around a maximum there may be sev-
eral ejections every day. The solar wind consists
mainly of electrons and protons. At the distance
of the Earth there are typically 5–10 particles per
cubic centimetre. There are also some nuclei of
helium atoms. The velocity is the solar wind close
to the poles of the Sun is about 800 km/s but
around the equator only about 300 km/s. At the
distance of the Earth the velocity of the particles
is about 500 km/s on the average. The Sun loses
2 −3 × 10−14M⊙of its mass every year as solar
wind.
Magnetic ﬁelds of planets direct the motions
of the particles of the solar wind (Sect. 7.7). The
auroras are the most outstanding phenomenon on
the Earth. Currents induced by the charged parti-
cles can also have considerable negative effects.
They can damage satellites and even electric net-
works. The most serious accident this far hap-
pened in 1989 in Quebec when a high voltage net-
work was damaged and millions of people had to
survive without electricity for several hours.
Space weather mean the interaction of the so-
lar wind and the magnetic environment of the
Earth. Because of its effects it is now followed
actively. The space weather affects the upper at-
mosphere but it is still debated whether it is con-
nected to variations of the weather and climate.

Variable Stars
Stars with changing magnitudes are called vari-
ables (Fig. 14.1). Variations in the brightness of
stars were ﬁrst noted in Europe at the end of the
16th century, when Tycho Brahe’s supernova lit
up (1572) and the regular light variation of the
star o Ceti (Mira) was observed (1596). The num-
ber of known variables has grown steadily as ob-
servational precision has improved (Fig. 14.2).
The most recent catalogues contain about 40,000
stars known or suspected to be variable.
Strictly speaking, all stars are variable. As
was seen in Chap. 12, the structure and bright-
ness of a star change as it evolves. Although
these changes are usually slow, some evolution-
ary phases may be extremely rapid. In certain
evolutionary stages, there will also be periodic
variations, for example pulsations of the outer
layers of a star.
Small variations in stellar brightness are also
caused by hot and cool spots on a star’s surface,
appearing and disappearing as it rotates about its
axis. The luminosity of the Sun changes slightly
because of the sunspots. Probably there are simi-
lar spots on almost all stars.
Initially stellar brightnesses were determined
visually by comparing stars near each other. Later
on, comparisons were made on photographic
plates. At present the most accurate observations
are made photoelectrically or using a CCD cam-
era. The magnitude variation as a function of time
is called the lightcurve of a star (Fig. 14.3). From
it one obtains the amplitude of the magnitude
variation and its period, if the variation is peri-
odic.
The basic reference catalogue of variable stars
is the General Catalogue of Variable Stars by the
Soviet astronomer Boris Vasilyevich Kukarkin.
New, supplemented editions appear at times; the
fourth edition published in 1985–1987, edited by
P.N. Kholopov, contains about 32,000 variables
of the Milky Way galaxy.
14.1
Classiﬁcation
When a new variable is discovered, it is given
a name according to the constellation in which
it is located. The name of the ﬁrst variable in
a given constellation is R, followed by the name
of the constellation (in the genitive case). The
symbol for the second variable is S, and so on,
to Z. After these, the two-letter symbols RR,
RS, ... to ZZ are used, and then AA to QZ (omit-
ting I). This is only enough for 334 variables,
a number that has long been exceeded in most
constellations. The numbering therefore contin-
ues: V335, V336, etc. (V stands for variable).
For some stars the established Greek letter sym-
bol has been kept, although they have later been
found to be variable (e.g. δ Cephei).
The classiﬁcation of variables is based on the
shape of the lightcurve, and on the spectral class
and observed radial motions. The spectrum may
also contain dark absorption lines from material
around the star. Observations can be made out-
side the optical region as well. Thus the radio
emission of some variables (e.g. ﬂare stars) in-
creases strongly, simultaneously with their opti-
cal brightness. Examples of radio and X-ray vari-

Variables are usually divided into three main
types: pulsating, eruptive and eclipsing variables.

14.2
Pulsating Variables
301

The eclipsing variables are binary systems in
which the components periodically pass in front
of each other. In these variables the light varia-
tions do not correspond to any physical change
in the stars. They have been treated in connection
with the binary stars. In the other variables the
brightness variations are intrinsic to the stars. In
the pulsating variables the variations are due to
the expansion and contraction of the outer lay-
ers. These variables are giants and supergiants
that have reached an unstable stage in their evolu-
tion. The eruptive variables are usually faint stars
ejecting mass. They are mostly members of close
binary systems in which mass is transferred from
one component to the other.
In addition a few rotating variables are known,
where the brightness variations are due to an
uneven temperature distribution on the surface,
starspots coming into sight when the star rotates.
Such stars may be quite common—after all, our
Sun is a weak rotating variable. The most promi-
nent group of rotating variables are the magnetic
A stars (e.g. the α2 Canum Venaticorum stars).
These stars have strong magnetic ﬁelds that may
be giving rise to starspots. The periods of rotating

variables range from about 1 day to 25 d, and the
amplitudes are less than 0.1 mag.
14.2
Pulsating Variables
The wavelengths of the spectral lines of the pul-
sating variables change along with the brightness
variations (Table 14.1). These changes are due to
the Doppler effect, showing that the outer layers
of the star are indeed pulsating. The observed gas
velocities are in the range of 40–200 km/s.
The period of pulsation corresponds to a pro-
per frequency of the star. Just like a tuning fork
vibrates with a characteristic frequency when hit,
a star has a fundamental frequency of vibration.
In addition to the fundamental frequency other
frequencies, “overtones”, are possible. The ob-
served brightness variation can be understood
as a superposition of all these modes of vibra-
tion. Around 1920, the English astrophysicist Sir
Arthur Eddington showed that the period of pul-
sation P is inversely proportional to the square
root of the mean density,
P ∝
1
√ρ .
(14.1)
The diameter of the star may double during the
pulsation, but usually the changes in size are mi-
nor. The main cause of the light variation is the
periodic variation of the surface temperature. We
have seen in Sect. 5.7 that the luminosity of a star

302
14
Variable Stars
depends sensitively on its effective temperature,
L ∝T 4
e . Thus a small change in effective temper-
ature leads to a large brightness variation.
Normally a star is in stable hydrostatic equi-
librium. If its outer layers expand, the density and
temperature decrease. The pressure then becomes
smaller and the force of gravity compresses the
gas again. However, unless energy can be trans-
ferred to the gas motions, these oscillations will
be damped.
The ﬂux of radiative energy from the stellar
interior could provide a source of energy for the
stellar oscillations, if it were preferentially ab-
sorbed in regions of higher gas density. Usually
this is not the case but in the ionisation zones,
where hydrogen and helium are partially ionised,
the opacity in fact becomes larger when the gas is
compressed. If the ionisation zones are at a suit-
able depth in the atmosphere, the energy absorbed
during compression and released during expan-
sion of an ionisation zone can drive an oscillation.
Stars with surface temperatures of 6000–9000 K
are liable to this instability. The corresponding
section of the HR diagram is called the cepheid
instability strip.
Cepheids
Among the most important pulsating
variables are the cepheids, named after δ Cephei
(Fig. 14.3). They are population I supergiants
(stellar populations are discussed in Sect. 18.2)
of spectral class F–K. Their periods are 1–50
days and their amplitudes, 0.1–2.5 magnitudes.
The shape of the light curve is regular, showing
a fairly rapid brightening, followed by a slower
fall off. There is a relationship between the period
of a cepheid and its absolute magnitude (i.e. lu-
minosity), discovered in 1912 by Henrietta Leav-
itt from cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
This period–luminosity relation (Fig. 14.4) can
be used to measure distances of stars and nearby
galaxies.
We have already noted that the pulsation pe-
riod is related to the mean density. On the other
hand the size of a star, and hence its mean density,
is related to its total luminosity. Thus one can un-
derstand why there should be a relation between
the period and the luminosity of a pulsating star.
Fig. 14.4 The period–luminosity relation for cepheids.
The black points and squares are theoretically calculated
values, the crosses and the straight line represent the ob-
served relation. (Drawing from Novotny, E. (1973): Intro-
duction to Stellar Atmospheres and Interiors (Oxford Uni-
versity Press, New York) p. 359)
The magnitudes M and periods P of classical
cepheids are shown in Fig. 14.4. The relation be-
tween M and logP is linear. However, to some
extent, the cepheid luminosities also depend on
colour: bluer stars are brighter. For accurate dis-
tance determinations, this effect needs to be taken
into consideration.
W Virginis Stars
In 1952 Walter Baade noted
that there are in fact two types of cepheids: the
classical cepheids and the W Virginis stars. Both
types obey a period–luminosity relation, but the
W Vir stars of a given period are 1.5 magnitudes
fainter than the corresponding classical cepheids.
This difference is due to the fact that the classical
cepheids are young population I objects, whereas
the W Vir stars are old stars of population II.
Otherwise, the two classes of variables are sim-
ilar.
Earlier, the W Vir period–luminosity relation
had been used for both types of cepheids. Con-
sequently the calculated distances to classical
cepheids were too small. For example, the dis-
tance to the Andromeda Galaxy had been based
on classical cepheids, since only these were
bright enough to be visible at that distance. When
the correct period–luminosity relation was used,
all extragalactic distances had to be doubled. Dis-
tances within the Milky Way did not have to be
changed, since their measurements were based on
other methods.

14.3
Eruptive Variables
303
Fig. 14.5 The lightcurve of a long period Mira variable
RR Lyrae Stars
The third important class of
pulsating variables are the RR Lyrae stars. Their
brightness variations are smaller than those of the
cepheids, usually less than a magnitude. Their pe-
riods are also shorter, less than a day. Like the
W Vir stars, the RR Lyrae stars are old popula-
tion II stars. They are very common in the glob-
ular star clusters and were therefore previously
called cluster variables.
The absolute magnitudes of the RR Lyrae stars
are about MV = 0.6±0.3. They are all of roughly
the same age and mass, and thus represent the
same evolutionary phase, where helium is just be-
ginning to burn in the core. Since the absolute
magnitudes of the RR Lyrae variables are known,
they can be used to determine distances to the
globular clusters.
Mira Variables
(See Fig. 14.5.) The Mira vari-
ables (named after Mira Ceti) are supergiants of
spectral classes M, S or C, usually with emis-
sion lines in their spectrum. They are losing gas
in a steady stellar wind. Their periods are nor-
mally 100–500 days, and for this reason, they
are also sometimes called long period variables.
The amplitude of the light variations is typically
about 6 magnitudes in the visual region. The pe-
riod of Mira itself is about 330 days and its di-
ameter is about 2 au. At its brightest, Mira has
the magnitude 2–4, but at light minimum, it may
be down to 12. The effective temperature of the
Mira variables is only about 2000 K. Thus 95 %
of their radiation is in the infrared, which means
that a very small change in temperature can cause
a very large change in visual brightness.
Other Pulsating Variables
One additional lar-
ge group of pulsating stars are the semiregular
and irregular variables. They are supergiants, of-
ten very massive young stars with unsteady pul-
sations in their extended outer layers. If there
is some periodicity in the pulsations, these vari-
ables are called semiregular; otherwise they are
irregular. An example of a semiregular variable
is Betelgeuse (α Orionis). The pulsation mecha-
nism of these stars is not well understood, since
their outer layers are convective, and the theory
of stellar convection is still poorly developed.
In addition to the main types of pulsating vari-
ables, there are some smaller separate classes,
shown in Fig. 14.2.
The dwarf cepheid and the δ Scuti stars, which
are sometimes counted as a separate type, are lo-
cated below the RR Lyrae stars in the cepheid
instability strip in the HR diagram. The dwarf
cepheids are fainter and more rapidly varying
than the classical cepheids. Their light curves of-
ten show a beating due to interference between
the fundamental frequency and the ﬁrst overtone.
The β Cephei stars are located in a different
part of the HR diagram than the other variables.
They are hot massive stars, radiating mainly in
the ultraviolet. The variations are rapid and of
small amplitude. The pulsation mechanism of the
β Cephei stars is unknown.
The RV Tauri stars lie between the cepheids
and the Mira variables in the HR diagram. Their
period depends slightly on the luminosity. There
are some unexplained features in the light curves
of the RV Tauri stars, e.g. the minima are alter-
nately deep and shallow.
14.3
Eruptive Variables
In the eruptive variables there are no regular
pulsations. Instead sudden outbursts occur in
which material is ejected into space. Nowadays
such stars are divided into two main categories,
eruptive and cataclysmic variables. Brightness
changes of eruptive variables are caused by sud-
den eruptions in the chromosphere or corona, the
contributions of which are, however, rather small
in the stellar scale. These stars are usually sur-
rounded by a gas shell or interstellar matter par-
ticipating in the eruption. This group includes e.g.
ﬂare stars, various kinds of nebular variables,

and R Coronae Borealis stars. Eruptions of the
cataclysmic variables are due to nuclear reactions
on the stellar surface or interior. Explosions are so
violent that they can even destroy the whole star.
This group includes novae and nova-like stars,
dwarf novae and supernovae (Table 14.2).
Flare Stars
The ﬂare or UV Ceti stars are
dwarf stars of spectral class M. They are young
stars, mostly found in young star clusters and as-
sociations. At irregular intervals there are ﬂare
outbursts on the surface of the stars similar to
those on the Sun. The ﬂares are related to dis-
turbances in the surface magnetic ﬁelds. The en-
ergy of the outbursts of the ﬂare stars is appar-
ently about the same as in solar ﬂares, but because
the stars are much fainter than the Sun, a ﬂare
can cause a brightening by up to 4–5 magnitudes.
A ﬂare lights up in a few seconds and then fades
away in a few minutes (Fig. 14.6). The same star
may ﬂare several times in one day. The optical
ﬂare is accompanied by a radio outburst, like in
the Sun. In fact, the ﬂare stars were the ﬁrst stars
to be detected as radio sources.
Nebular Variables
In connection with bright
and dark interstellar clouds e.g. in the constel-
lations of Orion, Taurus and Auriga, there are
Fig. 14.6 The outbursts of typical ﬂare stars are of short
duration
Fig. 14.7 Light curve of a T Tauri variable
variable stars. The T Tauri stars are the most in-
teresting of them. These stars are newly formed
or just contracting towards the main sequence.
The brightness variations of the T Tauri stars
are irregular (Fig. 14.7). Their spectra contain
bright emission lines, formed in the stellar chro-
mosphere, and forbidden lines, which can only be
formed at extremely low densities. The spectral
lines also show that matter is streaming out from
the stars.
Since the T Tauri stars are situated inside
dense gas clouds, they are difﬁcult to observe.
However, this situation has improved with the de-
velopment of radio and infrared techniques.
Stars in the process of formation may change
in brightness very rapidly. For example, in 1937,
FU Orionis brightened by 6 magnitudes. This star
is a strong source of infrared radiation, which
shows that it is still enveloped by large quantities
of interstellar dust and gas. A similar brighten-
ing by six magnitudes was observed in 1969 in
V1057 Cygni (Fig. 14.8). Before its brightening,
it was an irregular T Tauri variable; since then,
it has remained a fairly constant tenth-magnitude
AB star.

14.3
Eruptive Variables
305
Stars of the R Coronae Borealis type have “in-
verse nova” light curves. Their brightness may
drop by almost ten magnitudes and stay low for
years, before the star brightens to its normal lu-
minosity. For example, R CrB itself is of magni-
tude 5.8, but may fade to 14.8 magnitudes. Fig-
ure 14.9 shows its recent decline, based on ob-
servations by Finnish and French amateurs. The
R CrB stars are rich in carbon and the decline is
produced when the carbon condenses into a cir-
cumstellar dust shell.
One very interesting variable is η Carinae
(Fig. 14.10). At present it is a six magnitude
star surrounded by a thick, extensive envelope of
dust and gas. In the early 19th century η Carinae
was the second brightest star in the sky after Sir-
ius. Around the middle of the century it rapidly
dimmed to magnitude 8, but during the 20th cen-
tury it has brightened somewhat. η Carinae is a
so called bright blue variable. Its mass is esti-
mated to be of the order of 100 solar masses. The
circumstellar dust cloud is the brightest infrared
source in the sky outside the solar system. The en-
Fig. 14.8 In 1969–1970, the star V1057 Cygni bright-
ened by almost 6 magnitudes
ergy radiated by η Carinae is absorbed by the neb-
ula and re-radiated at infrared wavelengths. The
exact reason for the enormous brightness varia-
tions is not known. It is believed that the stability
of the star is disturbed by the radiation pressure
of the huge energy produced by a very massive
star. When the nucleus will collapse at the end of
the lifespan of the star, η Carinae will explode as
a supernova.
Novae
One of the best known types of erup-
tive variables are the novae. They are classiﬁed
into several subtypes: ordinary novae, recurrent
novae and nova-like variables. The dwarf novae
(Fig. 14.11) are nova-like rather frequently erup-
tive stars; although the lightcurves are similar to
those of novae, the mechanism is different.
The outbursts of all novae are rapid. Within
a day or two the brightness rises to a maximum,
which may be 7–16 magnitudes brighter than the
normal luminosity. This is followed by a gradual
decline, which may go on for months or years.
The light curve of a typical nova is shown in
Fig. 14.13. This light curve of Nova Cygni 1975
has been composed from hundreds of observa-
tions, mostly by amateurs.
In recurrent novae, the brightening is some-
what less than 10 magnitudes and in dwarf novae,
2–6 magnitudes. In both types there are repeated
outbursts. For recurrent novae the time between
outbursts is a few decades and for the dwarf no-
vae 20–600 days. The interval depends on the
strength of the outburst: the stronger the outburst,
the longer the time until the next one. The bright-

Fig. 14.12 The novae are
thought to be white dwarfs
accreting matter from
a nearby companion star.
At times, nuclear reactions
burning the accreted
hydrogen are ignited, and
this is seen as the ﬂare-up
of a nova
that the time between outbursts should be thou-
sands or millions of years.
Observations have shown all novae and dwarf
novae to be members of close binary systems.
One component of the system is a normal star and
the other is a white dwarf surrounded by a gas
ring. (The evolution of close binary systems was
considered in Sect. 12.6, where it was seen how
this kind of system might have been formed.)
The normal star ﬁlls its Roche surface, and ma-
terial from it streams over to the white dwarf.
When enough mass has collected on the surface
of the white dwarf, the hydrogen is explosively
ignited and the outer shell is ejected. The bright-
ness of the star grows rapidly. As the ejected
shell expands, the temperature of the star drops
and the luminosity gradually decreases. How-
ever, the outburst does not stop the mass transfer
from the companion star, and gradually the white
dwarf accretes new material for the next explo-
sion (Fig. 14.12).
The emission and absorption lines from the ex-
panding gas shell can be observed in the spec-
trum of a nova. The Doppler shifts correspond
to an expansion velocity of about 1000 km/s. As
the gas shell disperses, its spectrum becomes that
of a typical diffuse emission nebula. The expand-
ing shell around a nova can also sometimes be
directly seen in photographs.
In dwarf novae the energy does not come from
nuclear reactions but mainly from the potential
energy of the matter falling into the white dwarf.
An eruption occurs when the density of the accre-
tion disk formed by the matter ﬂowing from the
companion star exceeds a certain critical limit,
becomes unstable and is strongly heated.
A considerable fraction of the novae in our
Galaxy are hidden by interstellar clouds and their
number is therefore difﬁcult to estimate. In the
Andromeda Galaxy, observations indicate 25–
30 nova explosions per year. The number of
dwarf novae is much larger. In addition there
are nova-like variables, which share many of the
properties of novae, such as emission lines from
circumstellar gas and rapid brightness variations.
These variables, some of which are called symbi-
otic stars, are close binaries with mass transfer.
Gas streaming from the primary hits a gas disk
around the secondary in a hot spot, but there are
no nova outbursts.
The supersoft stars (SSS) are a somewhat pe-
culiar subclass of cataclysmic variables. Their X-
ray radiation is much stronger and much softer,
i.e. has longer wavelength, than that of the ordi-
nary cataclysmic variables. In the SSS objects the
component losing mass is more massive than the
compact star (white dwarf), in contrast with or-
dinary interacting binaries. Therefore the mass
transfer is an unstable self sustained process
transferring more material to the surface of the
white dwarf than in the normal cataclysmic vari-
ables. On the surface of the white dwarf a contin-
uous fusion reaction resembling nova eruptions
is producing a lot of soft X-ray radiation. Due to
their unstable character the SSS objects are short
lived and therefore relatively rare.

Supernovae
Explosions of stars as supernovae are among
the most energetic phenomena of the universe.
Within a couple of weeks the star becomes so
bright that its luminosity corresponds to over a
billion Suns or a whole small galaxy. Thus they
can be observed even at cosmological distances,
and they are useful standard candles for measur-
ing the dimensions of the universe and cosmo-
logical quantities. Supernovae are also important
sources of heavy elements. Most elements heav-
ier than iron have originated in supernova explo-
sions.
The maximum is followed by a slow decay,
and the nearest supernovae can be observed still
years after the explosion. In the explosion a gas

kilometres per second is ejected. Over 200 of
such supernova remnants have been discovered in
the Milky Way. Their ages vary from a few hun-
dred to tens of thousands of years.
At least six supernova explosions have been
observed in the Milky Way. Best known are the
“guest star” seen in China in 1054 (whose rem-
nant is the Crab nebula), Tycho Brahe’s super-
nova in 1572 and Kepler’s supernova in 1604. On
the basis of observations of other Sb–Sc-type spi-
ral galaxies, the interval between supernova ex-
plosions in the Milky Way is predicted to be about
50 years. Some will be hidden by obscuring ma-
terial, especially near the centre of the galaxy. In
particularly dusty starburst galaxies almost all su-
pernovae remain undetected due to the extinction
of the dust. Still the 400 years’ interval since the
last observed supernova in the Milky Way is un-
usually long.
Supernovae in other galaxies are detected
quite frequently. For example, both in 2006 and
2007 over 500 new supernovae were found. In
the near future the number will increase rapidly
thanks to new all sky surveys.
Earlier supernovae were divided just to two
main categories, I and II, based on whether their
spectra showed evidence of hydrogen. Later these
main classes have been divided into several sub-

supernovae
classes depending on other spectral features and
their lightcurves (Figs. 14.14, 14.15 and 14.16).
Type Ia supernovae are recognised by the sil-
icon absorption line (615 nm), which is strong
in the spectra of young novae. It is thought that
these supernovae originate in binaries, at least a
billion years old, consisting of a white dwarf and
its companion. In such a close binary material can
ﬂow from the companion to the white dwarf un-
til it mass exceeds the limit (about 1.4M⊙). Then
the pressure of the degenerate of the electron gas
inside the white dwarf cannot overcome the grav-
itation and star will collapse. Increase of the den-
sity and temperature will ignite an explosive fu-
sion reaction that can destroy the white dwarf.
The kinetic energy released in the process is of
the order of 1044 J causing part of the gas to ex-
pand even at a velocity of 0.1c. The origin of the
radiation energy (around 1042 J) is the ﬁssion of
the radioactive nickel isotope 56 created in the
explosion (typically about 0.5M⊙) into radioac-
tive cobalt and further into stable iron. The more
nickel is produced in the explosion the brighter
the supernova shines at its maximum; the abso-
lute magnitude will reach −19–−20. The shape
of the lightcurve depends on the brightness of the
supernova: the brighter the supernova the broader
the top of the lightcurve. Therefore the maximum
brightness of a typer Ia supernova can be de-
termined precisely from its lightcurve. This way
they can be used as standard candles to determine
dimensions of the universe and cosmological pa-
rameters (Chap. 20).
In Chap. 12 we discussed the ﬁnal stages of
stellar evolution and how the collapse of a mas-
sive star will lead to an explosion. It is believed

that all supernovae except type Ia are caused by
the collapse of massive and short lived stars. At
the end of its lifespan such a star has an iron
core that will collapse under its own gravity after
exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. In the stellar
core the matter will reach the density of atomic
nuclei and the outer layers bounce back send-
ing an outbound shock wave. The process cre-
ates a huge number of neutrinos. Since they in-
teract only weakly with the outer layers of the
star they rush to the surrounding space. The re-
maining core may become a neutron star or, in
the case of a very massive star, a black hole. Most
of the released energy (about 99 %) escapes with
the neutrinos. The outer layers of the star receive
a kinetic energy of about 1044 J, part of which
may be released as radiation when the expanding
matter hits the material surrounding the star and
later the interstellar matter. Typically the super-
nova itself emits radiation about 1042 J within a
few months after the explosion, reaching an ab-
solute magnitude between −16 and −20 at the
maximum. Later the brightness is sustained by
the ﬁssion of the radioactive nickel 56, born in the
explosion, to other elements just as in the case of
the type Ia supernovae.
If the spectrum of a supernova does not con-
tain strong hydrogen or silicon lines its type is
either Ib or Ic. The type Ib supernovae are recog-
nised by strong helium lines that are not present
in the spectra of type Ic. These supernovae orig-
inate in stars that don’t have any more hydrogen
in their outer layer. The stars exploding as type Ic
supernovae have also lost their outer layer of he-
lium. Such stars that have lost their outer layers
are called Wolf–Rayet stars.
All type II supernovae have hydrogen lines in
their spectra. They are divided into main types
II-P and II-L based on the ﬂat (plateau) and lin-
ear shape of the lightcurve. Recently several stars
that later exploded as supernovae have been iden-
tiﬁed in high resolution pictures taken e.g. by the
Hubble space telescope and the VLT telescope
before the explosion (Fig. 14.17). These obser-
vations have shown that the more common type
II-P supernovae originate in red supergiant stars
as predicted by theories of stellar evolution. Ini-
tially the masses of such stars have been at least 8
solar masses. Smaller stars are not believed to ex-
plode in a collapse. They end up as white dwarfs
after more quiescent evolution.
Type IIn supernovae are recognised by their
hydrogen emission lines that are much narrower
than in the spectra of other supernovae. The lines
originate in the matter around the star. The spec-
tra of young type IIn supernovae have hydrogen

lines, which, however, disappear in a few weeks,
and afterwards the spectrum resembles the type
Ib spectra. It is assumed that these supernovae
were originally massive stars that still had a small
amount of hydrogen in their outer layer before the
explosion. Thus they are intermedia between the
types II and Ib. The observed properties and types
of supernovae depend on the properties of their
progenitors, and hence individual supernovae can
of intermediate types. Hence it makes more sense
to classify supernovae according to the explosion
mechanism simply to two different types, ther-
monuclear and core collapse supernovae. About
30 % of the supernovae found in nearby galaxies
are thermonuclear and the remaining 70 % core
collapse supernovae.
On February 23, 1987 the ﬁrst burst of light
from a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
the small companion galaxy of the Milky Way,
reached the Earth (Fig. 14.18). This supernova,

SN 1987A, was of type II, and was the bright-
est supernova for 383 years. After its ﬁrst detec-
tion, SN 1987A was studied in great detail by all
available means. Although the general ideas of
Sects. 11.4 and 11.5 on the ﬁnal stages of stellar
evolution have been conﬁrmed, there are compli-
cations. Thus e.g. the progenitor star was a blue
rather than a red giant as expected, perhaps be-
cause of the lower abundance of heavy elements
in the Large Magellanic Cloud compared to that
in the Milky Way. The collapse of its core re-
leased a vast amount of energy as a pulse of neu-
trinos, which was detected in Japan and the USA.
The amount of energy released indicates that the
remnant is a neutron star.

Compact Stars
In astrophysics those stars in which the density
of matter is much larger than in ordinary stars are
known as compact objects. These include white
dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. In addi-
tion to a very high density, the compact objects
are characterised by the fact that nuclear reactions
have completely ceased in their interiors. Conse-
quently they cannot support themselves against
gravity by thermal gas pressure. In the white
dwarfs and neutron stars, gravity is resisted by the
pressure of a degenerate gas. In the black holes
the force of gravity is completely dominant and
compresses the stellar material to inﬁnite density.
Compact stars in binary systems give rise to a
variety of striking new phenomena. If the com-
panion star is losing mass by a stellar wind or
a Roche lobe overﬂow, the gas that is shed may
be accreted by the compact object. This will re-
lease gravitational energy that can be observable
in the form of X-ray emission and strong and
rapid brightness variations.
15.1
White Dwarfs
As was mentioned in Sect. 11.2, in ordinary stars
the pressure of the gas obeys the equation of state
of an ideal gas. In stellar interiors the gas is fully
ionised, i.e. it is plasma consisting of ions and
free electrons. The partial pressures of the ions
and electrons together with the radiation pressure
important in hot stars comprise the total pres-
sure balancing gravitation. When the star runs
out of its nuclear fuel, the density in the interior
increases, but the temperature does not change
much. The electrons become degenerate, and the
pressure is mainly due to the pressure of the de-
generate electron gas, the pressure due to the ions
and radiation being negligible. The star becomes
a white dwarf.
As will be explained in Box 15.1 the radius of
a degenerate star is inversely proportional to the
cubic root of the mass. Unlike in a normal star the
radius decreases as the mass increases.
The ﬁrst white dwarf to be discovered was Sir-
ius B, the companion of Sirius (Fig. 15.1). Its ex-
ceptional nature was realised in 1915, when it
was discovered that its effective temperature was
very high. Since it is faint, this meant that its ra-
dius had to be very small, slightly smaller than
that of the Earth. The mass of Sirius B was known
to be about equal to that of the Sun, so its density
had to be extremely large.
The high density of Sirius B was conﬁrmed in
1925, when the gravitational redshift of its spec-
tral lines was measured. This measurement also
provided early observational support to Einstein’s
general theory of relativity.
White dwarfs occur both as single stars and
in binary systems. Their spectral lines are broad-
ened by the strong gravitational ﬁeld at the sur-
face. In some white dwarfs the spectral lines are
further broadened by rapid rotation. Strong mag-
netic ﬁelds have also been observed.
White dwarfs have no internal sources of en-
ergy, but further gravitational contraction is pre-
vented by the pressure of the degenerate electron
gas. Radiating away the remaining heat, white
dwarfs will slowly cool, changing in colour from

white to red and ﬁnally to black. The cooling time
is comparable to the age of the Universe, and even
the oldest white dwarfs should still be observable.
Looking for the faintest white dwarfs has been
used as a way to set a lower limit on the age of
the Universe.
Cataclysmic Variables
When a white dwarf is
a member of a close binary system, it can ac-
crete mass from its companion star. The most in-
teresting case is where a main sequence star is
ﬁlling its Roche lobe, the largest volume it can
have without spilling over to the white dwarf. As
the secondary evolves, it expands and begins to
lose mass, which is eventually accreted by the
primary. Binary stars of this kind are known as
cataclysmic variables.
The present deﬁnition of the class of cata-
clysmic variables has gradually evolved, and in
consequence many types of systems that were
earlier viewed as separate are now collected un-
der this heading. In principle, even type Ia super-
novae should be included. The classical novae,
whose eruptions are caused by the sudden igni-
tion of hydrogen that has collected on the sur-
face of the white dwarf, have been described in
Sect. 14.3. In the eruptions most of the accreted
gas is expelled in a shell, but if the mass transfer
continues in the system further eruptions may oc-
cur, giving rise to recurrent novae. Finally, cata-
clysmic variables without eruptions, for example
pre-novae or post-novae, are classiﬁed as nova-
like variables.
The dwarf novae, also described in Sect. 14.3,
are produced by a quite different mechanism. In
their case the outbursts are not caused by ther-
monuclear reactions, but by instabilities in the
accretion ﬂow around the white dwarf. Although
the details of the outburst mechanism are still not
completely clear, the basic picture is that the disk
has two possible states, a hot and a cool one,
available. Under some conditions the disk cannot
remain permanently in either of these states, and
has to jump repeatedly between the hot outburst
state and the cool quiescent state.
A special type of nova-like variables are the
magnetic cataclysmic variables. In the polars the
magnetic ﬁeld is so strong that the accreted gas
cannot settle into an accretion disk. Instead it is
forced to follow the magnetic ﬁeld lines, form-
ing an accretion column. As the gas hits the sur-
face of the white dwarf it is strongly heated giving
rise to bright X-ray emission, which is a charac-
teristic feature of polars. Systems with a slightly

weaker magnetic ﬁeld are called intermediate po-
lars. These systems exhibit both X-ray emission
and variations due to an accretion disk.
15.2
Neutron Stars
If the mass of a star is large enough, the density of
matter may grow even larger than in normal white
dwarfs. The equation of state of a classical degen-
erate electron gas then has to be replaced with the
corresponding relativistic formula. In this case
decreasing the radius of the star no longer helps
in resisting the gravitational attraction. Equilib-
rium is possible only for one particular value of
the mass, the Chandrasekhar mass MCh, already
introduced in Sect. 12.5. The value of MCh is
about 1.4M⊙, which is thus the upper limit to the
mass of a white dwarf. If the mass of the star is
larger than MCh, gravity overwhelms the pressure
and the star will rapidly contract towards higher
densities. The ﬁnal stable state reached after this
collapse will be a neutron star (Fig. 15.2). On the
other hand, if the mass is smaller than MCh, the
pressure dominates. The star will then expand un-
til the density is small enough to allow an equilib-
rium state with a less relativistic equation of state.
When a massive star reaches the end of its evo-
lution and explodes as a supernova, the simulta-
neous collapse of its core will not necessarily stop
at the density of a white dwarf. If the mass of the
collapsing core is larger than the Chandrasekhar
mass (≳1.4M⊙), the collapse continues to a neu-
tron star.
An important particle reaction during the ﬁ-
nal stages of stellar evolution is the URCA pro-
cess, which was put forward by Schönberg and
Gamow in the 1940’s and which produces a large
neutrino emission without otherwise affecting the
composition of matter. (The URCA process was
invented in Rio de Janeiro and named after a local
casino. Apparently money disappeared at URCA
just as energy disappeared from stellar interiors in
the form of neutrinos. It is claimed that the casino
was closed by the authorities when this similarity
became known.) The URCA process consists of
the reactions
(Z,A) + e−→(Z −1,A) + νe,
(Z −1,A) →(Z,A) + e−+ ¯νe,
where Z is the number of protons in a nucleus;
A the mass number; e−an electron; and νe and
¯νe the electron neutrino and antineutrino. When
the electron gas is degenerate, the latter reaction
is suppressed by the Pauli exclusion principle. In
consequence the protons in the nuclei are trans-
formed into neutrons. As the number of neutrons
in the nuclei grows, their binding energies de-
crease. At densities of about 4 × 1014 kg/m3 the
neutrons begin to leak out of the nucleus, and at
1017 kg/m3 the nuclei disappear altogether. Mat-
ter then consists of a neutron “porridge”, mixed
with about 0.5 % electrons and protons.
Neutron stars are supported against gravity by
the pressure of the degenerate neutron gas, just
as white dwarfs are supported by electron pres-
sure. The equation of state is the same, except
that the electron mass is replaced by the neu-
tron mass, and that the mean molecular weight is
deﬁned with respect to the number of free neu-
trons. Since the gas consists almost entirely of
neutrons, the mean molecular weight is approx-
imately one.
The typical diameters of neutron stars are
about 10 km. Unlike ordinary stars they have

Compact Stars
Fig. 15.3 A rotating neutron star is surrounded by a
strong magnetic ﬁeld which drags electrons from the sur-
face and accelerates them to relativistic speeds over the
magnetic poles. When the electrons are accelerated along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines, they radiate so called curvature
radiation in a narrow beam. Since the magnetic axis is mis-
aligned with the rotation axis, the beams sweep around the
sky like in a lighthouse. (Lorimer–Kramer 2005, Hand-
book of Pulsar Astronomy, Cambridge University Press,

a well-deﬁned solid surface. The atmosphere
above it is a few centimetres thick. The upper
crust is a metallic solid with the density grow-
ing rapidly inwards. Most of the star is a neutron
superﬂuid, and in the centre, where the density
exceeds 1018 kg/m3, there may be a solid nu-
cleus of heavier particles (hyperons), or of quark
matter, where the quarks that normally constitute
neutrons have become unconﬁned.
A neutron star formed in the explosion and
collapse of a supernova will initially rotate ra-
pidly, because its angular momentum is un-
changed while its radius is much smaller than
before. In a few hours the star will settle in
a ﬂattened equilibrium, rotating several hundred
times per second. The initial magnetic ﬁeld of the
neutron star will also be compressed in the col-
lapse, so that there will be a strong ﬁeld coupling
the star to the surrounding material. The angu-
lar momentum of the neutron star is steadily de-

creased by the emission of electromagnetic radia-
tion, neutrinos, cosmic ray particles and possibly
gravitational radiation. Thus the angular veloc-
ity decreases. The rotation can also break the star
into several separate objects. They will eventu-
ally recombine when the energy of the system is
reduced. In some cases the stars can remain sep-
arated, resulting e.g. in a binary neutron star.
The theory of neutron stars was developed in
the 1930’s, but the ﬁrst observations were not
made until the 1960’s. At that time the pulsars,
a new type of rapidly pulsating radio sources,
were discovered and identiﬁed as neutron stars.
In the 1970’s neutron stars were also seen as X-
ray pulsars, X-ray bursters and magnetars.
Pulsars
The pulsars were discovered in 1967,
when Anthony Hewish and Jocelyn Bell in Cam-
bridge, England, detected sharp, regular radio
pulses coming from the sky. Since then about
1500 pulsars have been discovered (Fig. 15.4).
Their periods range from 0.0016 s (for the pul-
sar 1937 + 214) up to 20 minutes.
In addition to the steady slowing down of the
rotation, sometimes small sudden jumps in the

period are observed. These might be a sign of
rapid mass movements in the neutron star crust
(“starquakes”) or in its surroundings.
The origin of the radio pulses can be under-
stood if the magnetic ﬁeld is tilted at an angle
of 45◦–90◦with respect to the rotation axis. The
ﬁeld is so strong that it drags electrons from the
surface and accelerates them to relativistic speeds
over the magnetic poles. When the electrons are
accelerated along the magnetic ﬁeld lines, they
radiate so called curvature radiation which is re-
lated to synchrotron radiation (Fig. 15.3). In the
direction of the magnetic poles two thin beams
of radio radiation are emitted. The beams sweep
around the sky, and if the Earth happens to be in
the path of the beam a pulsar is seen.
The best-known pulsar is located in the Crab
nebula (Figs. 15.5 and 15.7). This small neb-
ula in the constellation Taurus was noted by the
French astronomer Charles Messier in the middle
of the 18th century and became the ﬁrst object in
the Messier catalogue, M1. The Crab nebula was
found to be a strong radio source in 1948 and an
X-ray source in 1964. The pulsar was discovered
in 1968. In the following year it was observed op-
tically and was also found to be an X-ray emitter.
Neutron stars are difﬁcult to study optically,
since their luminosity in the visible region is very
small (typically about 10−6 L⊙). For instance the
Vela pulsar has been observed at a visual magni-
tude of about 25. In the radio region, it is a very
strong pulsating source.
A few pulsars have been discovered in binary
systems; the ﬁrst one, PSR 1913+16, in 1974.
In 1993 Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse were
awarded the Nobel prize for the detection and
studies of this pulsar. The pulsar orbits about
a companion, presumably another neutron star,
with the orbital eccentricity 0.6 and the period
8 hours. The observed period of the pulses is al-
tered by the Doppler effect, and this allows one to
determine the velocity curve of the pulsar. These
observations can be made very accurately, and it
has therefore been possible to follow the changes
in the orbital elements of the system over a pe-
riod of several years. For example, the periastron
direction of the binary pulsar has been found to
rotate about 4◦per year. This phenomenon can
be explained by means of the general theory of
relativity; in the solar system, the corresponding
rotation (the minor fraction of the rotation not
explained by the Newtonian mechanics) of the
perihelion of Mercury is 43 arc seconds per cen-
tury.
The binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 has also pro-
vided the ﬁrst strong evidence for the existence of

318
15
Compact Stars
gravitational waves. During the time of observa-
tion the orbital period of the system has steadily
decreased. This shows that the system is losing
orbital energy at a rate that agrees exactly with
that predicted by the general theory of relativity.
The lost energy is radiated as gravitational waves.
Magnetars
The energy emitted by common
pulsars has its origin in the slowing down of their
rotation. In some neutron stars, the magnetars,
the magnetic ﬁeld is so strong that the energy re-
leased in the decay of the ﬁeld is the main source
of energy. Whereas in ordinary pulsars the mag-
netic ﬁeld is typically 109 T, in magnetars a typi-
cal value may be 109–1011 T.
Magnetars were ﬁrst invoked as an explana-
tion of the soft gamma repeaters (SGR), X-ray
stars that irregularly emit bright, short (0.1 s) re-
peating ﬂashes of low-energy gamma rays. Later
a second class of mysterious objects, the anoma-
lous X-ray pulsars (AXP), were identiﬁed as
magnetars. AXP are slowly rotating pulsars, with
a rotation period of 6 to 12 seconds. Despite this
they are bright X-ray sources, which can be un-
derstood if their energy is of magnetic origin.
It is thought that magnetars are the remnants
of stars that were more massive and rapidly ro-
tating than those giving rise to ordinary pulsars,
although the details are still subject to debate.
A magnetar ﬁrst appears as a SGR. During this
phase, which only lasts about 10,000 years, the
very strong magnetic ﬁeld is slowing down the
rate of rotation. At the same time the ﬁeld is
drifting with respect to the neutron star crust.
This causes shifts in the crust structure, leading
to powerful magnetic ﬂares and the observed out-
bursts. After about 10,000 years the rotation has
slowed down so much that the outbursts cease,
leaving the neutron star observable as an AXP.
Gamma Ray Bursts
For a long time the gam-
ma ray bursts (GRB), very short and sharp
gamma ray pulses ﬁrst discovered in 1973, re-
mained a mystery. Unlike the much less common
SGR, the GRB never recurred, and they had no
optical or X-ray counterparts. A ﬁrst major ad-
vance was made when satellite observations with
the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory showed
Fig. 15.6 The location of the peculiar type Ibc supernova
SN 1998bw at redshift z = 0.0085 is in the circle to the
lower left. This was also the position of the faint gam-
ma-ray burst GRB 980425, the ﬁrst GRB to be connected
with a supernova. The circle on the upper right marks an
ultraluminous X-ray source. (C. Kouveliotou et al. 2004,
ApJ 608, 872, Fig. 1)
that the gamma ray bursts are almost uniformly
distributed in the sky, unlike the known neutron
stars.
The nature of the gamma ray bursts is now
becoming clear thanks to dedicated observing
programmes that have used burst detections by
gamma and X-ray satellites such as Beppo-SAX
and, in particular, Swift rapidly to look for after-
glows of the GRB at optical wavelengths. The de-
tection of these afterglows has made it possible to
determine distances to the bursts and their loca-
tion in their host galaxies (see Fig. 15.6).
It has become clear that there are at least two
kinds of bursts, with the self-descriptive names
long soft bursts, and short hard bursts. The long
soft gamma ray bursts, lasting longer than 2 sec-
onds, have now been convincingly shown to be
produced in the explosions of massive stars at the
end of their life, speciﬁcally supernovae of types
Ib and Ic (Sect. 14.3). Only a small fraction of
all type Ibc supernovae give rise to a GRB. The
explosions that produce GRB have been called
hypernovae, and are among the brightest objects
in the Universe. A gamma ray burst observed in
late 2005 took place when the Universe was only
900 million years old, making it one of the most

distant objects ever observed. The conditions re-
quired for hypernova explosions are still not cer-
tain.
The nature of the systems giving rise to short
gamma ray bursts, lasting less than 2 seconds,
have been more difﬁcult to ascertain. The most
popular theory has been that they are produced in
compact binary systems consisting of two neu-
tron stars or a neutron star and a black hole.
These systems lose energy by gravitational radi-
ation, and eventually the two components should
merge, producing a burst of gamma radiation.
This theory has now received strong support
when the afterglow of a few short bursts has been
detected in the outer parts of their host galaxies.
Since the stars in these regions are all old and
no longer give rise to core-collapse supernovae,
the neutron star merger hypothesis appears most
likely. However, it is still also possible that some
of the short bursts are exceptionally bright mag-
netar ﬂares.
Box 15.1 (The Radius of White Dwarfs and
Neutron Stars) The mass of a white dwarf or
a neutron star determines its radius. This fol-
lows from the equation of hydrostatic equilib-
rium and from the pressure-density relation for
a degenerate gas. Using the hydrostatic equilib-
rium equation (11.1)
dP
dr = −GMrρ
r2
one can estimate the average pressure P :
%%%%
dP
dr
%%%% ≈P
R ∝M × M/R3
R2
= M2
R5 .
Here we have used ρ ∝M/R3. Thus the pres-
sure obeys
P ∝M2/R4.
(1)
In the nonrelativistic case, the pressure of a de-
generate electron gas is given by (11.16):
P ≈

h2/me

(μemH)−5/3ρ5/3
and hence
P ∝
ρ5/3
meμ5/3
e
.
(2)
By combining (1) and (2) we obtain
M2
R4 ∝
M5/3
R5meμ5/3
e
or
R ∝
1
M1/3meμ5/3
e
∝M−1/3.
Thus the smaller the radius of a white dwarf is,
the larger its mass will be. If the density be-
comes so large that the relativistic equation of
state (11.17) has to be used, the expression for
the pressure is
P ∝ρ4/3 ∝M4/3
R4 .
As the star contracts, the pressure grows at the
same rate as demanded by the condition for hy-
drostatic support (1). Once contraction has be-
gun, it can only stop when the state of mat-
ter changes: the electrons and protons com-
bine into neutrons. Only a star that is massive
enough can give rise to a relativistic degenerate
pressure.
The neutrons are fermions, just like the elec-
trons. They obey the Pauli exclusion principle,

320

and the degenerate neutron gas pressure is ob-
tained from an expression analogous to (2):
Pn ∝
ρ5/3
mnμ5/3
n
,
where mn is the neutron mass and μn, the
molecular weight per free neutron. Corre-
spondingly, the radius of a neutron star is given
by
Rns ∝
1
M1/3mnμ5/3
n
.
If a white dwarf consists purely of helium,
μe = 2; for a neutron star, μn ≈1. If a white
dwarf and a neutron star have the same mass,
the ratio of their radii is

Thus the radius of a neutron star is about 1/600
of that of a white dwarf. Typically Rns is about
10 km.
15.3
Black Holes
If the mass of a star exceeds MOV (Sect. 12.5),
and if it does not lose mass during its evolu-
tion it can no longer reach any stable ﬁnal state.
The force of gravity will dominate over all other
forces, and the star will collapse to a black hole.
A black hole is black because not even light can
escape from it. Already at the end of the 18th
century Laplace showed that a sufﬁciently mas-
sive body would prevent the escape of light from
its surface. According to classical mechanics, the
escape velocity from a body of radius R and
mass M is
ve =

2GM
R
.
This is greater than the speed of light, if the radius
is smaller than the critical radius
RS = 2GM/c2.
(15.1)
Fig. 15.8 A black hole is surrounded by a spherical event
horizon. In addition to this a rotating black hole is sur-
rounded by a ﬂattened surface inside which no matter can
remain stationary. This region is called the ergosphere
The same value for the critical radius, the Schwa-
rzschild radius, is obtained from the general the-
ory of relativity. For example, for the Sun, RS
is about 3 km; however, the Sun’s mass is so
small that it cannot become a black hole by nor-
mal stellar evolution. Because the mass of a black
hole formed by stellar collapse has to be larger
than MOV the radius of the smallest black holes
formed in this way is about 5–10 km.
The properties of black holes have to be stud-
ied on the basis of the general theory of relativity,
which is beyond the scope of this book. Thus only
some basic properties are discussed qualitatively.
An event horizon is a surface through which
no information can be sent out, even in principle.
A black hole is surrounded by an event horizon at
the Schwarzschild radius (Fig. 15.8). In the the-
ory of relativity each observer carries with him
his own local measure of time. If two observers
are at rest with respect to each other at the same
point their clocks go at the same rate. Otherwise
their clock rates are different, and the apparent
course of events differs, too.
Near the event horizon the different time def-
initions become signiﬁcant. An observer falling
into a black hole reaches the centre in a ﬁnite
time, according to his own clock, and does not
notice anything special as he passes through the
event horizon. However, to a distant observer he
never seems to reach the event horizon; his ve-

15.3
Black Holes
321
locity of fall seems to decrease towards zero as
he approaches the horizon.
The slowing down of time also appears as
a decrease in the frequency of light signals. The
formula for the gravitational redshift can be writ-
ten in terms of the Schwarzschild radius as (Ap-
pendix B)
ν∞= ν

1 −2GM



r .
(15.2)
Here, ν is the frequency of radiation emitted at
a distance r from the black hole and ν∞the fre-
quency observed by an inﬁnitely distant observer.
It can be seen that the frequency at inﬁnity ap-
proaches zero for radiation emitted near the event
horizon.
Since the gravitational force is directed to-
wards the centre of the hole and depends on the
distance, different parts of a falling body feel
a gravitational pull that is different in magnitude
and direction. The tidal forces become extremely
large near a black hole so that any material falling
into the hole will be torn apart. All atoms and el-
ementary particles are destroyed near the central
point, and the ﬁnal state of matter is unknown to
present-day physics. The observable properties of
a black hole do not depend on how it was made.
Not only all information on the material com-
position disappears as a star collapses into a black
hole; any magnetic ﬁeld, for example, also disap-
pears behind the event horizon. A black hole can
only have three observable properties: mass, an-
gular momentum and electric charge.
It is improbable that a black hole could have
a signiﬁcant net charge. An electrically charged
black hole would attract particles with opposite
charge until it became neutral. Rotation, on the
other hand, is typical to stars, and thus black
holes, too, must rotate. Since the angular momen-
tum is conserved, stars collapsed to black holes
must rotate very fast.
In 1963 Roy Kerr managed to ﬁnd a solution
of the ﬁeld equations for a rotating black hole. In
addition to the event horizon a rotating hole has
another limiting surface, an ellipsoidal static limit
(Fig. 15.8). Objects inside the static limit cannot
be kept stationary by any force, but they must
orbit the hole. However, it is possible to escape
from the region between the static limit and the
event horizon, called the ergosphere. In fact it is
possible to utilise the rotational energy of a black
hole by dropping an object to the ergosphere in
such a way that part of the object falls into the
hole and another part is slung out. The outcom-
ing part may then have considerably more kinetic
energy than the original object.
At present the only known way in which
a black hole could be directly observed is by
means of the radiation from gas falling into it.
For example, if a black hole is part of a binary
system, gas streaming from the companion will
settle into a disk around the hole. Matter at the
inner edge of the disk will fall into the hole. The
accreting gas will lose a considerable part of its
energy (up to 40 % of the rest mass) as radiation,
which should be observable in the X-ray region.
Some rapidly and irregularly varying X-ray
sources of the right kind have been discovered.
The ﬁrst strong evidence for black hole in an
X-ray binary was for Cygnus X-1 (Fig. 15.9). Its
luminosity varies on the time scale of 0.001 s,
which means that the emitting region must be
only 0.001 light-seconds or a few hundred kilo-
metres in size. Only neutron stars and black holes
are small and dense enough to give rise to such
high-energy processes. Cygnus X-1 is the smaller
component of the double system HDE 226868.
The larger component is an optically visible su-
pergiant with a mass 20–25M⊙. The mass of
the unseen component has been calculated to be
10–15M⊙. If this is correct, the mass of the sec-
ondary component is much larger than the up-
per limit for a neutron star, and thus it has to be
a black hole.
Today 20 such systems are known, where the
compact component has a mass larger than 3M⊙,
and therefore is probably a black hole. As shown
in Fig. 15.10 these can be of very different sizes.
Nearly all of them have been discovered as X-ray
novae.
Many frightening stories about black holes
have been invented. It should therefore be stressed
that they obey the same dynamical laws as other
stars—they are not lurking in the darkness of
space to attack innocent passers-by. If the Sun
became a black hole, the planets would continue
in their orbits as if nothing had happened.

Compact Stars
Fig. 15.9 The arrow shows the variable star V1357 Cyg.
Its companion is the X-ray source Cygnus X-1, suspected
to be a black hole. Cyg X-1 itself is so faint that it can be
observed by its X-ray radiation only. The bright star to the
lower right of V1357 is η Cygni, one of the brightest stars
in the constellation Cygnus
So far we have discussed only black holes with
masses in the range of stellar masses. There is
however no upper limit to the mass of a black
hole. Many active phenomena in the nuclei of
galaxies can be explained with supermassive
black holes with masses of millions or thousands
of millions solar masses (see Sect. 19.7).
15.4
X-ray Binaries
Close binaries where a neutron star or a black
hole is accreting matter from its companion, usu-
ally a main sequence star, will be visible as
strong X-ray sources. They are generally classi-
ﬁed as high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB), when
the companion has a mass larger than about
10M⊙, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB)
with a companion mass smaller than 1.2M⊙.
In HMXBs the source of the accreted material
is a strong stellar wind. LMXBs are produced
by Roche-lobe overﬂow of the companion star,
either because the major axis of the binary de-
creases due to angular momentum loss from the
system, or else because the radius of the compan-
ion is increasing as it evolves.
Because of the rapid evolution of the massive
component in HMXBs these systems are young
and short-lived, 105–107 a. In LMXBs the life-
time is determined by the mass-transfer process,
and may be longer, 107–1010 a. In many respects
they are similar to cataclysmic variables, and may
give rise to analogous phenomena.
Many kinds of variable X-ray sources have
been discovered since they were ﬁrst observed in
the 1970’s. Among these, the X-ray pulsars and
the X-ray bursters can only be neutron stars. In
other types of X-ray binaries it can be difﬁcult to
determine whether the primary is a neutron star
or a black hole.
Neutron stars and black holes are formed in
supernova explosions, and in a binary system the
explosion would normally be expected to disrupt
the binary. An X-ray binary will only form under
special conditions. Some examples are shown in
Sect. 12.6.
X-ray Pulsars
X-ray pulsars always belong to
binary systems and may be either HMXBs or
LMXBs. The pulse periods of X-ray pulsars in
high-mass systems are signiﬁcantly longer than
those of radio pulsars, from a few seconds to tens
of minutes. In contrast to radio pulsars, the period
of the pulsed emission of these pulsars decreases
with time.
The characteristic properties of X-ray pul-
sars can be understood from their binary nature.
A neutron star formed in a binary system is ﬁrst
seen as a normal radio pulsar. Initially, the strong
radiation of the pulsar prevents gas from falling
onto it. However, as it slows down, its energy de-
creases, and eventually the stellar wind from the
companion can reach its surface. The incoming
gas is channelled to the magnetic polar caps of
the neutron star, where it emits strong X-ray ra-
diation as it hits the surface. This produces the
observed pulsed emission.
In low-mass systems, the angular momentum
of the incoming gas speeds up the rotation of

the pulsar. The maximum possible rotation rate
of a neutron star before centrifugal forces start to
break it up corresponds to a period of about a mil-
lisecond. A few millisecond pulsars with periods
of this order are known, both in the radio and in
the X-ray region. It is thought that these are (or,
in the radio case, have once been) members of bi-
nary systems.
The emission curve of a typical fast X-ray pul-
sar, Hercules X1, is shown in Fig. 15.11. The pe-
riod of the pulses is 1.24 s. This neutron star is
part of an eclipsing binary system, known from
optical observations as HZ Herculis. The orbital
properties of the system can therefore be deter-
mined. Thus e.g. the mass of the pulsar is about
one solar mass, reasonable for a neutron star.
X-ray Bursters
X-ray bursters are irregular
variables, showing sudden brightenings, known
as
type
I
X-ray
bursts,
at
random
times
(Fig. 15.12). The typical interval between out-
bursts is a few hours or days, but more rapid
bursters are also known. The strength of the out-
burst seems to be related to the recharging time.
Type I X-ray bursts are analogous to the erup-
tions of classical novae. However, the source of
radiation in X-ray bursters cannot be the igni-
tion of hydrogen, since the maximum emission
is in the X-ray region. Instead, gas from the com-
panion settles on the surface of the neutron star,
where hydrogen burns steadily to helium. Then,
when the growing shell of helium reaches a criti-
cal temperature, it burns to carbon in a rapid he-
lium ﬂash. Since, in this case, there are no thick
damping outer layers, the ﬂash appears as a burst
of X-ray radiation.
X-ray Novae
The X-ray pulsars and bursters
have to be neutron stars. Other X-ray binaries
may be either neutron stars or black holes. All
compact X-ray sources are variable to some ex-
tent. In the persistent sources the variations are
moderate, an the sources always visible. The ma-
jority of sources are transient.

If the X-ray bursters correspond to classical
novae, the counterparts of dwarf novae are the
X-ray novae, also known as soft X-ray transients
(SXT). Quantitatively there are large differences
between these types of systems. Dwarf novae
have outbursts lasting for a few days at intervals
of a few months, for SXTs the outbursts hap-
pen at decade-long intervals and last for months.
A dwarf nova brightens by a factor about 100 dur-
ing outbursts, a SXT by a factor of 106. The light-
curves of neutron-star and black-hole SXTs are
compared in Fig. 15.13.
The SXTs are alternating between (at least)
two states: During the high state thermal radia-
tion from the accretion disk dominates, whereas
in the low state the X-ray have a higher energy,
and are produced by Compton scattering by hot
electrons in a disk corona or a jet.
Microquasars
One interesting aspect of X-ray
binaries is their connection to models of active
galactic nuclei (AGN, Sect. 19.7). In both sys-
tems a black hole, which in the case of AGN may

15.5
Examples
325
have a mass in the range 106–1010 M⊙, is sur-
rounded by an accretion disk.
In an X-ray binary there is similarly an accre-
tion disk surrounding a compact object, a stellar-
mass black hole. It will exhibit phenomena in
many respects similar to those in AGN. Since
the galactic sources are much nearer, and vary on
much shorter time-scales, they may allow more
detailed observations of these phenomena.

black-hole (GRO J1655–40) transient source, as observed
by the All Sky Monitor on RXTE. (D. Psaltis 2006, in
Compact Stellar X-ray Sources, ed. Lewin, vdKlis, CUP,
p. 16, Fig. 1.9)
For example, relativistic jets perpendicular to
the disk are common in AGN, and they can also
be expected in X-ray binaries. A few examples
of such microquasars have been discovered, see
Fig. 15.14.
Furthermore, in AGN the jet may sometimes
be pointing straight at us. Relativistic effects will
then lead to a brightening of the source. In a mi-
croquasar there might be a similar effect, which
would provide one explanation for the ultralu-
minous X-ray sources (ULX), sources which ap-
pear to be too luminous to be produced by or-
dinary stellar-mass black holes. This is impor-
tant, because according to an alternative model
ULXs contain an intermediate mass black hole
with a mass about 103 M⊙. The origin of such in-
termediate mass black holes, if they exist, is an
intriguing problem.

The Interstellar Medium
Although most of the mass of the Milky Way
Galaxy is condensed into stars, interstellar space
is not completely empty. It contains gas and dust
in the form both of individual clouds and of a dif-
fuse medium. Interstellar space typically contains
about one gas atom per cubic centimetre and
100 dust particles per cubic kilometre.
Altogether, about 10 % of the mass of the
Milky Way consists of interstellar gas. Since the
gas is strongly concentrated in the galactic plane
and the spiral arms, in these regions there are
many places where the quantities of stars and in-
terstellar matter are about equal. The dust (a bet-
ter name would be “smoke”, since the particle
sizes are much smaller than in terrestrial dust)
constitutes about one percent of the gas. High-
energy cosmic ray particles are mixed with the
gas and dust. There is also a weak, but still very
important, galactic magnetic ﬁeld.
At present the most important observations of
the interstellar medium are made at radio and in-
frared wavelengths, since the peak of the emis-
sion often lies at these wavelengths. But many
forms of interstellar matter (such as solid bod-
ies with diameters larger than 1 mm) would be
almost impossible to detect on the basis of their
emission or absorption. In principle, the mass of
these forms of matter might be larger than the ob-
served mass of all other forms put together. How-
ever, an upper limit on the total mass of interstel-
lar matter, regardless of its form, can be derived
on the basis of its gravitational effects. This is
the Oort limit. The galactic gravitational ﬁeld is
determined by the distribution of matter. By ob-
serving the motions of stars perpendicular to the
galactic plane, the vertical gravitational force and
hence the amount of mass in the galactic plane
can be determined. The result is that the local
density within 1 kpc of the Sun is (7.3–10.0) ×
10−21 kgm−3. The density of known stars is
(5.9–6.7) × 10−21 kgm−3 and that of known in-
terstellar matter about 1.7 × 10−21 kgm−3. Thus
there is very little room for unknown forms of
mass in the solar neighbourhood. However, the
limit concerns only the dark matter concentrated
in the galactic plane. There are indications that
the Milky Way is surrounded by a spherical halo
of dark matter (Chap. 18).
16.1
Interstellar Dust
The ﬁrst clear evidence for the existence of in-
terstellar dust was obtained around 1930. Before
that, it had been generally thought that space is
completely transparent and that light can propa-
gate indeﬁnitely without extinction.
In 1930 Robert Trumpler published his study
of the space distribution of the open clusters.
The absolute magnitudes M of the brightest stars
could be estimated on the basis of the spectral
type. Thus the distance r to the clusters could
be calculated from the observed apparent magni-
tudes m of the bright stars:
m −M = 5lg
r
10 pc.
(16.1)
Trumpler also studied the diameters of the clus-
ters. The linear diameter D is obtained from the

apparent angular diameter d by means of the for-
mula
D = dr,
(16.2)
where r is the distance of the cluster.
It caught Trumpler’s attention that the more
distant clusters appeared to be systematically
larger than the nearer ones (Fig. 16.1). Since this
could hardly be true, the distances of the more
distant clusters must have been overestimated.
Trumpler concluded that space is not completely
transparent, but that the light of a star is dimmed
by some intervening material. To take this into
account, (16.1) has to be replaced with (4.17)
m −M = 5lg
r
10 pc + A,
(16.3)
where A ≥0 is the extinction in magnitudes due
to the intervening medium. If the opacity of the
medium is assumed to be the same at all distances
and in all directions, A can be written
A = ar,
(16.4)
where a is a constant. Trumpler obtained for the
average value of a in the galactic plane, apg =
0.79 mag/kpc, in photographic magnitudes. At
present, a value of 2 mag/kpc is used for the av-
erage extinction. Thus the extinction over a 5 kpc
path is already 10 magnitudes.
Extinction due to dust varies strongly with
direction. For example, visible light from the
Fig. 16.1 The diameters of open star clusters calculated
with the distance given by the formula (15.1) according
to Trumpler (1930). The increase of the diameter with dis-
tance is not a real phenomenon, but an effect of interstellar
extinction, which was discovered in this way
galactic centre (distance 8–9 kpc) is dimmed by
30 magnitudes. Therefore the galactic centre can-
not be observed at optical wavelengths.
Extinction is due to dust grains that have diam-
eters near the wavelength of the light. Such par-
ticles scatter light extremely efﬁciently. Gas can
also cause extinction by scattering, but its scatter-
ing efﬁciency per unit mass is much smaller. The
total amount of gas allowed by the Oort limit is so
small that scattering by gas is negligible in inter-
stellar space. (This is in contrast with the Earth’s
atmosphere, where air molecules make a signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the total extinction).
Interstellar particles can cause extinction in
two ways:
1. In absorption the radiant energy is trans-
formed into heat, which is then re-radiated
at infrared wavelengths corresponding to the
temperature of the dust particles.
2. In scattering the direction of light propagation
is changed, leading to a reduced intensity in
the original direction of propagation.
An expression for interstellar extinction will
now be derived. The size, index of refraction and
number density of the particles are assumed to
be known. For simplicity we shall assume that all
particles are spheres with the same radius a and
the geometrical cross section πa2. The true ex-
tinction cross section of the particles Cext will be
Cext = Qextπa2,
(16.5)
where Qext is the extinction efﬁciency factor.
Let us consider a volume element with length
dl and cross section dA, normal to the direction
of propagation (Fig. 16.2). It is assumed that the
particles inside the element do not shadow each
other. If the particle density is n, there are ndl dA
particles in the volume element and they will
cover the fraction dτ of the area dA, where
dτ = ndAdl Cext
dA
= nCext dl.
In the length dl the intensity is thus changed by
dI = −I dτ.
(16.6)
On the basis of (16.6) dτ can be identiﬁed as the
optical depth.

Fig. 16.2 Extinction by a distribution of particles. In the
volume element with length dl and cross section dA, there
are ndAdl particles, where n is the particle density in the
medium. If the extinction cross section of one particle is
Cext, the total area covered by the particles is ndAdl Cext.
Thus the fractional decrease in intensity over the distance
dl is dI/I = −ndAdl Cext/dA = −nCext dl
The total optical depth between the star and
the Earth is
τ(r) =
 r
0
dτ =
 r
0
nCext dl = Cextnr,
where n is the average particle density along the
given path. According to (4.18) the extinction in
magnitudes is
A = (2.5lge)τ,
and hence
A(r) = (2.5lge)Cextnr.
(16.7)
This formula can also be inverted to calculate n,
if the other quantities are known.
The extinction efﬁciency factor Qext can be
calculated exactly for spherical particles with
given radius a and refractive index m. In general,
Qext = Qabs + Qsca,
where
Qabs = absorption efﬁciency factor,
Qsca = scattering efﬁciency factor.
If we deﬁne
x = 2πa/λ,
(16.8)
where λ is the wavelength of the radiation, then
Qext = Qext(x,m).

for spherical particles for the refractive indices m = 1.5
and m = 1.33 (refractive index of water). The horizon-
tal axis is related to the size of the particle according to
x = 2πa/λ, where a is the particle radius and λ, the wave-
length of the radiation
The exact expression for Qext is a series ex-
pansion in x that converges more slowly for
larger values of x. When x ≪1, the process is
called Rayleigh scattering; otherwise it is known
as Mie scattering. Figure 16.3 shows Qext as
a function of x for m = 1.5 and m = 1.33. For
very large particles, (x ≫1) Qext = 2, as appears
from Fig. 16.3. Purely geometrically one would
have expected Qext = 1; the two times larger scat-
tering efﬁciency is due to the diffraction of light
at the edges of the particle.
Other observable phenomena, apart from ex-
tinction, are also caused by interstellar dust. One
of these is the reddening of the light of stars.
(This should not be confused with the redshift
of spectral lines.) Reddening is due to the fact

lar extinction. As the wavelength increases, the extinc-
tion approaches zero. (Drawing based on Greenberg, J.M.

and Stellar Systems, Vol. VII (The University of Chicago

that the amount of extinction becomes larger for
shorter wavelengths. Going from red to ultravi-
olet, the extinction is roughly inversely propor-
tional to wavelength. For this reason the light of
distant stars is redder than would be expected on
the basis of their spectral class. The spectral class
is deﬁned on the basis of the relative strengths of
the spectral lines which are not affected by ex-
tinction.
According to (4.20), the observed colour index
B −V of a star is
B −V = MB −MV + AB −AB
= (B −V )0 + EB−V,
(16.10)
where (B −V )0 is the intrinsic colour of the star
and EB−V the colour excess. As noted in Sect. 4.5
the ratio between the visual extinction AV and the
colour excess is approximately constant:
R =
AV
EB−V
=
AV
AB −AV
≈3.0.
(16.11)
R does not depend on the properties of the star
or the amount of extinction. This is particularly
important in photometric distance determinations
because of the fact that the colour excess EB−V
can be directly determined from the difference
between the observed colour index B −V and the
intrinsic colour (B −V )0 known from the spec-
tral class. One can then calculate the extinction
AV ≈3.0EB−V
(16.12)
and ﬁnally the distance. Since the interstellar
medium is far from homogeneous, the colour ex-
cess method gives a much more reliable value
than using some average value for the extinction
in (4.18).
The wavelength dependence of the extinction,
A(λ), can be studied by comparing the magni-
tudes of stars of the same spectral class in differ-
ent colours. These measurements have shown that
A(λ) approaches zero as λ becomes very large.
In practice A(λ) can be measured up to a wave-
length of about two micrometres. The extrapola-
tion to zero inverse wavelength is then fairly re-
liable. Figure 16.4(a) shows A(λ) as a function
of inverse wavelength. It also illustrates how the
quantities AV and EB−V, which are needed in or-
der to calculate the value of R, are obtained from
this extinction or reddening curve. Figure 16.4(b)
shows the observed extinction curve. The points
in the ultraviolet (λ ≤0.3 m) are based on rocket
measurements.
It is clear from Fig. 16.4(b) that interstellar ex-
tinction is largest at short wavelengths in the ul-
traviolet and decreases for longer wavelengths. In
the infrared it is only about ten percent of the op-
tical extinction and in the radio region it is vanish-
ingly small. Objects that are invisible in the opti-

16.1
Interstellar Dust
331
cal region can therefore be studied at infrared and
radio wavelengths.
Another observed phenomenon caused by dust
is the polarisation of the light of the stars. Since
spherical particles cannot produce any polarisa-
tion, the interstellar dust particles have to be non-
spherical in shape. If the particles in a cloud are
aligned by the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, they
will polarise the radiation passing through the
cloud. The degree of polarisation and its wave-
length dependence give information on the prop-
erties of the dust particles. By studying the di-
rection of polarisation in various directions, one
can map the structure of the galactic magnetic
ﬁeld.
In the Milky Way interstellar dust is essen-
tially conﬁned to a very thin, about 100 pc, layer
in the galactic plane. The dust in other spiral
galaxies has a similar distribution and is directly
visible as a dark band in the disk of the galaxy
(Fig. 19.17 bottom). The Sun is located near
the central plane of the galactic dust layer, and
thus the extinction in the direction of the galac-
tic plane is very large, whereas the total extinc-
tion towards the galactic poles may be less than
0.1 magnitudes. This is apparent in the distribu-
tion of galaxies in the sky: at high galactic lat-
itudes, there are many galaxies, while near the
galactic plane, there is a 20◦zone where hardly
any galaxies are seen. This empty region is called
the zone of avoidance.
If a homogeneous dust layer gives rise to a to-
tal extinction of m magnitudes in the vertical
direction, then according to Fig. 16.5, the total
extinction at galactic latitude b will be
m(b) = m/sinb.
(16.13)
If the galaxies are uniformly distributed in space,
then in the absence of extinction, the number of
galaxies per square degree brighter than the mag-
nitude m would be
lgN0(m) = 0.6m + C,
(16.14)
where C is a constant (see Exercise 17.1). How-
ever, due to extinction, a galaxy that would oth-
erwise have the apparent magnitude m0 will have

magnitudes is proportional to the pathlength traversed.
If the extinction in the direction of the galactic pole is

the magnitude
m(b) = m0 + m(b) = m0 + m/sinb,
(16.15)
where b is the galactic latitude. Thus the observ-
able number of galaxies at latitude b will be
lgN(m,b) = lgN0

or
lgN(m,b) = C′ −0.6 m
sinb,
(16.16)
where C′ = lgN0(m) does not depend on the
galactic latitude. By making galaxy counts at var-
ious latitudes b, the extinction m can be de-
termined. The value obtained from galaxy counts
made at Lick Observatory is mpg = 0.51 mag.
The total vertical extinction of the Milky Way
has also been determined from the colour ex-
cesses of stars. These investigations have yielded
much smaller extinction values, about 0.1 mag. In
the direction of the north pole, extinction is only
0.03 mag. The disagreement between the two ex-
tinction values is probably largely due to the fact
that the dust layer is not really homogeneous. If
the Sun is located in a local region of low dust
content, the view towards the galactic poles might
be almost unobstructed by dust.

Dark Nebulae
Observations of other galaxies
show that the dust is concentrated in the spi-
ral arms, in particular at their inner edge. In ad-
dition dust is concentrated in individual clouds,
which appear as star-poor regions or dark nebulae
against the background of the Milky Way. Exam-
ples of dark nebulae are the Coalsack in the south-
ern sky (Fig. 16.6) and the Horsehead nebula
in Orion. Sometimes the dark nebulae form ex-
tended winding bands, and sometimes small, al-
most spherical, objects. Objects of the latter type
are most easy to see against a bright background,
e.g. a gas nebula (see Fig. 16.19). These objects
have been named globules by Bart J. Bok, who
put forward the hypothesis that they are clouds
that are just beginning to contract into stars.
The extinction by a dark nebula can be illus-
trated and studied by means of a Wolf diagram,
shown schematically in Fig. 16.7. The diagram is
constructed on the basis of star counts. The num-
ber of stars per square degree in some magnitude
interval (e.g. between magnitudes 14 and 15) in
the cloud is counted and compared with the num-
ber outside the nebula. In the comparison area,
the number of stars increases monotonically to-
wards fainter magnitudes. In the dark nebula the
numbers ﬁrst increase in the same way, but be-
yond some limiting magnitude (10 in the ﬁgure)

16.1

Fig. 16.7 Wolf diagram. The horizontal coordinate is the
magnitude and the vertical coordinate is the number of
stars per square degree in the sky brighter than that mag-
nitude. A dark nebula diminishes the brightness of stars
lying behind it by the amount m
the number of stars falls below that outside the
cloud. The reason for this is that the fainter stars
are predominantly behind the nebula, and their
brightness is reduced by some constant amount
m (2 magnitudes in the ﬁgure). The brighter
stars are mostly in front of the nebula and suffer
no extinction.
Reﬂection Nebulae
If a dust cloud is near
a bright star, it will scatter, i.e. reﬂect the light
of the star. Thus individual dust clouds can some-
times be observed as bright reﬂection nebulae.
Some 500 reﬂection nebulae are known.
The regions in the sky richest in reﬂection
nebulae are the areas around the Pleiades and
around the giant star Antares. Antares itself is
surrounded by a large red reﬂection nebula. This
region is shown in Fig. 16.8. Figure 16.9 shows
the reﬂection nebula NGC 2068, which is located
near a large, thick dust cloud a few degrees north-
west of Orion’s belt. It is one of the brightest
reﬂection nebulae and the only one included in
the Messier catalogue (M78). In the middle of
the nebula there are two stars of about 11 mag-
nitudes. The northern star illuminates the nebula,
while the other one is probably in front of the
nebula. Figure 16.10 shows the reﬂection nebula
NGC 1435 around Merope in the Pleiades. An-
other bright and much-studied reﬂection nebula is
NGC 7023 in Cepheus. It, too, is connected with
a dark nebula. The illuminating star has emission
lines in its spectrum (spectral type Be). Infrared
stars have also been discovered in the area of the
nebula, probably a region of star formation.
In 1922 Edwin Hubble published a fundamen-
tal investigation of bright nebulae in the Milky
Way. On the basis of extensive photographic and
spectroscopic observations, he was able to estab-
lish two interesting relationships. First he found
that emission nebulae only occur near stars with
spectral class earlier than B0, whereas reﬂec-
tion nebulae may be found near stars of spectral
class B1 and later. Secondly Hubble discovered
a relationship between the angular size R of the
nebula and the apparent magnitude m of the illu-
minating star:
5lgR = −m + const.
(16.17)
Thus the angular diameter of a reﬂection neb-
ula is larger for a brighter illuminating star. Since
the measured size of a nebula generally increases
for longer exposures, i.e. fainter limiting surface
brightness, the value of R should be deﬁned to
correspond to a ﬁxed limiting surface brightness.
The value of the constant in the Hubble relation
depends on this limiting surface brightness. The
Hubble relation for reﬂection nebulae is shown in
Fig. 16.11, based on measurements by Sidney van
den Bergh from Palomar Sky Atlas plates. Each
point corresponds to a reﬂection nebula and the
straight line represents the relation (16.17), where
the value of the constant is 12.0 (R is given in arc
minutes).
The Hubble relation can be derived theo-
retically, if it is assumed that the illumination
of a dust cloud is inversely proportional to the
square of the distance to the illuminating star, and
that the dust clouds are uniformly distributed in
space. The theoretical Hubble relation also gives
an expression for the constant on the right-hand
side, which involves the albedo and the phase
function of the grains.
The observations of reﬂection nebulae show
that the albedo of interstellar grains must be quite

λ = 600–680 nm. (The sharp rings in (b) are reﬂections
of Antares in the correction lens of the Schmidt camera.)
The nebulae located in the area are identiﬁed in draw-
ing (c). B44 and H4 are dark nebulae. There is a large
reﬂection nebula around Antares, which is faintly visible
in the blue (a), but bright in the red (b) regions. Antares
is very red (spectral class M1) and therefore the reﬂec-
tion nebula is also red. In contrast, the reﬂection nebu-
lae around the blue stars ρ Ophiuchi (B2), CD-24° 12684
(B3), 22 Scorpii (B2) and σ Scorpii (B1) are blue and are
visible only in (a). In (b) there is an elongated nebula to
the right of σ Scorpii, which is invisible in (a). This is an
emission nebula, which is very bright in the red hydro-
gen Hα line (656 nm). In this way reﬂection and emission
nebulae can be distinguished by means of pictures taken in
different wavelength regions. (Photograph (a) E. Barnard,
and (b) K. Mattila)
high. It has not yet been possible to obtain its pre-
cise numerical value in this way, since the dis-
tances between the nebulae and their illuminating
stars are not known well enough.
One may also consider the surface brightness
of dark nebulae that are not close enough to a star
to be visible as reﬂection nebulae. These nebulae
will still reﬂect the diffuse galactic light from all
the stars in the Milky Way. Calculations show that
if the dust grains have a large albedo, then the
reﬂected diffuse light should be bright enough to
be observable, and it has indeed been observed.
Thus the dark nebulae are not totally dark. The
diffuse galactic light constitutes about 20–30 %
of the total brightness of the Milky Way.
Dust Temperature
In addition to scattering
the interstellar grains also absorb radiation. The
absorbed energy is re-radiated by the grains
at infrared wavelengths corresponding to their

temperatures. The temperature of dust in inter-
stellar space (including dark nebulae) is about
10–20 K. The corresponding wavelength ac-
cording to Wien’s displacement law (5.21) is
300–150 µm. Near a hot star the temperature of
the dust may be 100–600 K and the maximum
emission is then at 30–5 µm. In H II regions the
dust temperature is about 70–100 K.
The rapid development of infrared astronomy
in the 1970’s has brought all the above-mentioned
dust sources within the reach of observations
(Fig. 16.12). In addition infrared radiation from
the nuclei of normal and active galaxies is largely
thermal radiation from dust. Thermal dust emis-
sion is one of the most important sources of in-
frared radiation in astronomy.

lengths. Two examples of the images by the IRAS satel-
lite. (a) In a view towards the Galactic centre, the dust is
seen to be concentrated in a narrow layer in the galactic

the centre of the image, are in the region of the Horsehead

16.2
Interstellar Gas
337
Fig. 16.13 More than 99 % of the radiation from the
η Carinae nebula (Fig. 13.10) is in the infrared. The
peak in the visual region is from the hydrogen Hα line
(0.66 µm). In the infrared, the silicate emission from dust
is evident at 10 µm. (Allen, D.A. (1975): Infrared, the New
Astronomy (Keith Reid Ltd., Shaldon) p. 103)
One of the strongest infrared sources in the
sky is the nebula around the star η Carinae. The
nebula consists of ionised gas, but infrared radi-
ation from dust is also clearly visible in its spec-
trum (Fig. 16.13). In even more extreme cases,
the central star may be completely obscured,
but revealed by the infrared emission from hot
dust.
Composition and Origin of the Dust
(Ta-
bles 16.1 and 16.2). From the peaks in the ex-
tinction curve, it may be concluded that inter-
stellar dust contains water ice and silicates, and
probably graphite as well. The sizes of the grains
can be deduced from their scattering properties;
usually they are smaller than one micrometre.
The strongest scattering is due to grains of about
0.3 µm but smaller particles must also be present.
Dust grains are formed in the atmospheres of
stars of late spectral types (K, M). Gas condenses
into grains just as water in the Earth’s atmosphere
may condense into snow and ice. The grains are
then expelled into interstellar space by the ra-
diation pressure. Grains may also form in con-
nection with star formation and possibly directly
from atoms and molecules in interstellar clouds
as well.
16.2
Interstellar Gas
The mass of gas in interstellar space is a hundred
times larger than that of dust. Although there is
more gas, it is less easily observed, since the gas
does not cause a general extinction of light. In the
optical region it can only be observed on the basis
of a small number of spectral lines.
The existence of interstellar gas began to be
suspected in the ﬁrst decade of the 20th cen-
tury, when in 1904 Johannes Hartmann observed
that some absorption lines in the spectra of cer-
tain binary stars were not Doppler shifted by
the motions of the stars like the other lines. It
was concluded that these absorption lines were
formed in gas clouds in the space between the
Earth and the stars. In some stars there were sev-
eral lines, apparently formed in clouds moving
with different velocities. The strongest lines in
the visible region are those of neutral sodium
and singly ionised calcium (Fig. 16.14). In the
ultraviolet region, the lines are more numerous.
The strongest one is the hydrogen Lyman α line
(121.6 nm).
On the basis of the optical and ultraviolet lines,
it has been found that many atoms are ionised in
interstellar space. This ionisation is mainly due
to ultraviolet radiation from stars and, to some
extent, to ionisation by cosmic rays. Since the
density of interstellar matter is very low, the free
electrons only rarely encounter ions, and the gas
remains ionised.
About thirty elements have been discovered by
absorption line observations in the visible and ul-
traviolet region. With a few exceptions, all ele-
ments from hydrogen to zinc (atomic number 30)
and a few additional heavier elements have been
detected (Table 16.3). Like in the stars, most of

they do not produce any absorption lines. The
element abundances in the interstellar medium
(gas + dust) would then be normal, although the
interstellar gas is depleted in heavy elements.
This interpretation is supported by the observa-
tion that in regions where the amount of dust is
smaller than usual, the element abundances in the
gas are closer to normal.

Ultraviolet
observations
have provided an excellent way of studying in-
terstellar neutral hydrogen. The strongest inter-
stellar absorption line, as has already been men-
tioned, is the hydrogen Lyman α line (Fig. 16.15).
This line corresponds to the transition of the elec-
tron in the hydrogen atom from a state with prin-
cipal quantum number n = 1 to one with n = 2.
The conditions in interstellar space are such that
almost all hydrogen atoms are in the ground
state with n = 1. Therefore the Lyman α line is
a strong absorption line, whereas the Balmer ab-
sorption lines, which arise from the excited initial
state n = 2, are unobservable. (The Balmer lines
are strong in stellar atmospheres with tempera-
tures of about 10,000 K, where a large number of
atoms are in the ﬁrst excited state.)
The ﬁrst observations of the interstellar Lyman
α line were made from a rocket already in 1967.
More extensive observations comprising 95 stars
were obtained by the OAO 2 satellite. The dis-
tances of the observed stars are between 100 and
1000 parsecs.
Comparison of the Lyman α observations with
observations of the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line
have been especially useful. The distribution of
neutral hydrogen over the whole sky has been
mapped by means of the 21 cm line. However,
the distances to nearby hydrogen clouds are difﬁ-
cult to determine from these observations. In the

Lyman α observations one usually knows the dis-
tance to the star in front of which the absorbing
clouds must lie.
The average gas density within about 1 kpc
of the Sun derived from the Lyman α observa-
tions is 0.7 atoms/cm3. Because the interstellar
Lyman α line is so strong, it can be observed even
in the spectra of very nearby stars. For exam-
ple, it has been detected by the Copernicus satel-
lite in the spectrum of Arcturus, whose distance
is only 11 parsecs. The deduced density of neu-
tral hydrogen between the Sun and Arcturus is
0.02–0.1 atoms/cm3. Thus the Sun is situated in
a clearing in the interstellar medium, where the

density is less than one tenth of the average den-
sity.
If a hydrogen atom in its ground state absorbs
radiation with a wavelength smaller than 91.2 nm,
it will be ionised. Knowing the density of neutral
hydrogen, one can calculate the expected distance
a 91.2 nm photon can propagate before being ab-
sorbed in the ionisation of a hydrogen atom. Even
in the close neighbourhood of the Sun, where the
density is exceptionally low, the mean free path
of a 91.2 nm photon is only about a parsec and
that of a 10 nm photon a few hundred parsecs.
Thus only the closest neighbourhood of the Sun
can be studied in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
spectral region.

atom in the ground state may be either paral-
lel or opposite. The energy difference between
these two states corresponds to the frequency of
1420.4 MHz. Thus transitions between these two
hyperﬁne structure energy levels will give rise to
a spectral line at the wavelength of 21.049 cm
(Fig. 5.8). The existence of the line was theo-
retically predicted by Hendrick van de Hulst in
1944, and was ﬁrst observed by Harold Ewen
and Edward Purcell in 1951. Studies of this line
have revealed more about the properties of the
interstellar medium than any other method—one
might even speak of a special branch of 21 cm as-
tronomy. The spiral structure and rotation of the
Milky Way and other galaxies can also be studied
by means of the 21 cm line.
Usually the hydrogen 21 cm line occurs in
emission. Because of the large abundance of hy-
drogen, it can be observed in all directions in
the sky. Some observed 21 cm line proﬁles are
shown in Fig. 16.16. Rather than frequency or
wavelength, the radial velocity calculated from
the Doppler formula is plotted on the horizon-
tal axis. This is because the broadening of the
21 cm spectral line is always due to gas mo-
tions either within the cloud (turbulence) or of the
cloud as a whole. The vertical axis is mostly plot-
ted in terms of the antenna temperature TA (see
Chap. 5), the usual radio astronomical measure
of intensity. The brightness temperature of an ex-
tended source is then Tb = TA/ηB, where ηB is
the beam efﬁciency of the antenna.
For the 21 cm line hν/k = 0.07 K, and thus
hν/kT ≪1 for all relevant temperatures. One
Fig. 16.16 Hydrogen 21 cm emission line proﬁles in the
galactic plane at longitude 180◦, 90◦and 1◦(in the direc-
tion l = 0◦there is strong absorption). The horizontal axis
gives the radial velocity according to the Doppler formula,
the vertical axis gives the brightness temperature. (Burton,
W.B. (1974): “The Large Scale Distribution of Neutral
Hydrogen in the Galaxy”, in Galactic and Extra-Galac-
tic Radio Astronomy, ed. by Verschuur, G.L., Kellermann,

(16.18)
In the solution of the equation of radiative trans-
fer (5.42) the intensity can thus be directly related
to a corresponding temperature. By deﬁnition,
Iν is related to the brightness temperature Tb, and

In certain directions in the Milky Way there is
so much hydrogen along the line of sight that the
21 cm line is optically thick, τν ≫1. In that case
Tb = Texc,
(16.20)
i.e. the brightness temperature immediately yields
the excitation temperature of the cloud. This is
often referred to as the spin temperature TS.
The excitation temperature need not always
agree with the kinetic temperature of the gas.
However, in the present case the population num-
bers of the hyperﬁne levels are determined by
mutual collisions of hydrogen atoms: the time
between collisions is 400 years on the average,
whereas the time for spontaneous radiative transi-
tions is 11 million years; thus the excitation tem-
perature will be the same as the kinetic tempera-
ture. The observed temperature is T ≈125 K.
The distance to a source cannot be obtained
directly from the observed emission. Thus one
can only study the number of hydrogen atoms in
a cylinder with a 1 cm2 base area extending from
the observer to outside the Milky Way along the
line of sight. This is called the projected or col-
umn density and is denoted by N. One may also
consider the column density N(v)dv of atoms
with velocities in the interval [v,v + dv].
It can be shown that if the gas is optically
thin, the brightness temperature in a spectral line
is directly proportional to the column density N
of atoms with the corresponding radial velocity.
Hence, if the diameter L of a cloud along the line
of sight is known, the gas density can be deter-
mined from the observed line proﬁle:
n = N/L.
The diameter L can be obtained from the ap-
parent diameter, if the distance and shape of the
cloud are assumed known.
The distances of clouds can be determined
from their radial velocities by making use of the
rotation of the Milky Way (Sect. 18.3). Thus if
the observed peaks in the 21 cm line proﬁles
(Fig. 16.16) are due to individual clouds, their
distances and densities can be obtained. Since
radio observations are not affected by extinc-
tion, it has been possible in this way to map the
density distribution of neutral hydrogen in the
whole galactic plane. The resulting distribution,
based on observations at Leiden and Parkes, is
shown in Fig. 16.17. It appears that the Milky
Way is a spiral galaxy and that the interstel-
lar hydrogen is concentrated in the spiral arms.
The average density of interstellar hydrogen is
1 atom/cm3, but the distribution is very inhomo-
geneous. Typically the hydrogen forms denser re-
gions, a few parsecs in size, where the densities
may be 10–100 atoms/cm3. Regions where the
hydrogen is predominantly neutral are known as
H I regions (in contrast to H II regions of ionised
hydrogen).
The hydrogen 21 cm line may also occur in
absorption, when the light from a bright radio
source, e.g. a quasar, passes through an interven-
ing cloud. The same cloud may give rise to both
an absorption and an emission spectrum. In that
case the temperature, optical thickness and hy-
drogen content of the cloud can all be derived.
Like interstellar dust hydrogen is concentrated
in a thin disk in the galactic plane. The thickness
of the hydrogen layer is about twice that of the
dust or about 200 pc.
H II Regions
In many parts of space hydrogen
does not occur as neutral atoms, but is ionised.
This is true in particular around hot O stars,
which radiate strongly in the ultraviolet. If there
is enough hydrogen around such a star, it will
be visible as an emission nebula of ionised hy-
drogen. Such nebulae are known as H II region
(Figs. 16.18 and 16.19).
A typical emission nebula is the great nebula
in Orion, M42. It is visible even to the unaided
eye, and is a beautiful sight when seen through
a telescope. In the middle of the nebula there is
a group of four hot stars known as the Trapez-
ium, which can be distinguished inside the bright
nebula, even with a small telescope. The Trapez-
ium stars emit strong ultraviolet radiation, which
keeps the gas nebula ionised.

in atoms/cm3. (Oort, J.H., Kerr, P.T., Westerhout, G.L. (1958): Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 118, 379)
Unlike a star a cloud of ionised gas has
a spectrum dominated by a few narrow emission
lines. The continuous spectrum of H II regions is
weak. In the visible region the hydrogen Balmer
emission lines are particularly strong. These are
formed when a hydrogen atom recombines into
an excited state and subsequently returns to the
ground state via a sequence of radiative transi-
tions. Typically a hydrogen atom in a H II re-
gion remains ionised for several hundred years.
Upon recombination it stays neutral for some
months, before being ionised again by a photon
from a nearby star.
The number of recombinations per unit time
and volume is proportional to the product of the
densities of electrons and ions,
nrec ∝neni.

In completely ionised hydrogen, ne = ni, and

(16.22)
Most recombinations will include the transition
n = 3 →2, i.e. will lead to the emission of a Hα
photon. Thus the surface brightness of a nebula in
the Hα line will be proportional to the emission
measure,

where the integral is along the line of sight

The ionisation of a helium atom requires more
energy than that of a hydrogen atom, and thus re-
gions of ionised helium are formed only around

the hottest stars. In these cases, a large H II region
will surround a smaller central He+ or He++ re-
gion. The helium lines will then be strong in the
spectrum of the nebula.
Although hydrogen and helium are the main
constituents of clouds, their emission lines are
not always strongest in the spectrum. At the be-
ginning of this century it was even suggested
that some strong unidentiﬁed lines in the spec-
tra of nebulae were due to the new element neb-
ulium. However, in 1927 Ira S. Bowen showed
that they were forbidden lines of ionised oxygen
and nitrogen, O+, O++ and N+. Forbidden lines
are extremely difﬁcult to observe in the labora-
tory, because their transition probabilities are so
small that at laboratory densities the ions are de-
excited by collisions before they have had time
to radiate. In the extremely diffuse interstellar
gas, collisions are much less frequent, and thus
there is a chance that an excited ion will make
the transition to a lower state by emitting a pho-
ton.
Because of interstellar extinction, only the
nearest H II regions can be studied in visible light.
At infrared and radio wavelengths much more
distant regions can be studied. The most impor-
tant lines at radio wavelengths are recombination
lines of hydrogen and helium; thus the hydro-
gen transition between energy levels 110 and 109
at 5.01 GHz has been much studied. These lines
are also important because with their help radial
velocities, and hence (using the galactic rotation

law), distances of H II regions can be determined,
just as for neutral hydrogen.
The physical properties of H II regions can
also be studied by means of their continuum radio
emission. The radiation is due to bremsstrahlung
or free–free emission from the electrons. The in-
tensity of the radiation is proportional to the emis-
sion measure EM deﬁned in (16.23). H II regions
also have a strong infrared continuum emission.
This is thermal radiation from dust inside the neb-
ula.
H II regions are formed when a hot O or B star
begins to ionise its surrounding gas. The ionisa-
tion steadily propagates away from the star. Be-
cause neutral hydrogen absorbs ultraviolet radia-
tion so efﬁciently, the boundary between the H II
region and the neutral gas is very sharp. In a ho-
mogeneous medium the H II region around a sin-
gle star will be spherical, forming a Strömgren
sphere. For a B0 V star the radius of the Ström-
gren sphere is 50 pc and for an A0 V star only
1 pc.
The temperature of a H II region is higher
than that of the surrounding gas, and it therefore
tends to expand. After millions of years, it will
have become extremely diffuse and will eventu-
ally merge with the general interstellar medium.
16.3
Interstellar Molecules
The ﬁrst interstellar molecules were discov-
ered in 1937–1938, when molecular absorp-
tion lines were found in the spectra of some
stars. Three simple diatomic molecules were de-
tected: methylidyne CH, its positive ion CH+
and cyanogen CN. A few other molecules were
later discovered by the same method in the ul-
traviolet. Thus molecular hydrogen H2 was dis-
covered in the early 1970’s, and carbon monox-
ide, which had been discovered by radio ob-
servations, was also detected in the ultraviolet.
Molecular hydrogen is the most abundant in-
terstellar molecule, followed by carbon monox-
ide.
Molecular Hydrogen
The detection and study
of molecular hydrogen has been one of the
most important achievements of UV astronomy.
Molecular hydrogen has a strong absorption band
at 105 nm, which was ﬁrst observed in a rocket
experiment in 1970 by George R. Carruthers, but
more extensive observations could only be made
with the Copernicus satellite. The observations
showed that a signiﬁcant fraction of interstellar
hydrogen is molecular, and that this fraction in-
creases strongly for denser clouds with higher ex-

tinction. In clouds with visual extinction larger
than one magnitude essentially all the hydrogen
is molecular.
Hydrogen molecules are formed on the surface
of interstellar grains, which thus act as a chem-
ical catalyst. Dust is also needed to shield the
molecules from the stellar UV radiation, which
would otherwise destroy them. Molecular hydro-
gen is thus found where dust is abundant. It is of
interest to know whether gas and dust are well
mixed or whether they form separate clouds and
condensations.
UV observations have provided a reliable way
of comparing the distribution of interstellar gas
and dust. The amount of dust between the ob-
server and a star is obtained from the extinction of
the stellar light. Furthermore, the absorption lines
of atomic and molecular hydrogen in the ultravi-
olet spectrum of the same star can be observed.
Thus the total amount of hydrogen (atomic +
molecular) between the observer and the star can
also be determined.
Observations indicate that the gas and dust
are well mixed. The amount of dust giving rise
to one magnitude visual extinction corresponds
to 1.9 × 1021 hydrogen atoms (one molecule is
counted as two atoms). The mass ratio of gas and
dust obtained in this way is 100.
Radio Spectroscopy
Absorption lines can only
be observed if there is a bright star behind the
molecular cloud. Because of the large dust extinc-
tion, no observations of molecules in the densest
clouds can be made in the optical and ultravio-
let spectral regions. Thus only radio observations
are possible for these objects, where molecules
are especially abundant.
Radio spectroscopy signiﬁes an immense step
forward in the study of interstellar molecules. In
the early 1960’s, it was still not believed that there
might be more complicated molecules than di-
atomic ones in interstellar space. It was thought
that the gas was too diffuse for molecules to
form and that any that formed would be destroyed
by ultraviolet radiation. The ﬁrst molecular radio
line, the hydroxyl radical OH, was discovered in
1963. Many other molecules have been discov-
ered since then. By 2002, about 130 molecules
had been detected, the heaviest one being the
13-atom molecule HC11N.
Molecular lines in the radio region may be ob-
served either in absorption or in emission. Ra-
diation from diatomic molecules like CO (see
Fig. 16.20) may correspond to three kinds of
transitions. (1) Electron transitions correspond to
changes in the electron cloud of the molecule.
These are like the transitions in single atoms, and

their wavelengths lie in the optical or ultraviolet
region. (2) Vibrational transitions correspond to
changes in the vibrational energy of the molecule.
Their energies are usually in the infrared region.
(3) Most important for radio spectroscopy are the
rotational transitions, which are changes in the
rotational energy of the molecule. Molecules in
their ground state do not rotate, i.e. their angular
momentum is zero, but they may be excited and
start rotating in collisions with other molecules.
For example, carbon sulﬁde CS returns to its
ground state in a few hours by emitting a millime-
tre region photon.
A number of interstellar molecules are listed
in Table 16.4. Many of them have only been de-
tected in the densest clouds (mainly the Sagittar-
ius B2 cloud at the galactic centre), but others are
very common. The most abundant molecule H2
cannot be observed at radio wavelengths, because
it has no suitable spectral lines. The next most
abundant molecules are carbon monoxide CO,
the hydroxyl radical OH and ammonia NH3, al-
though their abundance is only a small fraction
of that of hydrogen. However, the masses of in-
terstellar clouds are so large that the number
of molecules is still considerable. (The Sagittar-
ius B2 cloud contains enough ethanol, C2H5OH,
for 1028 bottles of vodka.)
Both the formation and survival of interstel-
lar molecules requires a higher density than is
common in interstellar clouds; thus they are most
common in dense clouds. Molecules are formed
in collisions of atoms or simpler molecules or
catalysed on dust grains. Molecular clouds must
also contain a lot of dust to absorb the ultravio-
let radiation entering from outside that otherwise
would disrupt the molecules. The most suitable
conditions are thus found inside dust and molec-
ular clouds near dense dark nebulae and H II re-
gions.
Most of the molecules in Table 16.4 have only
been detected in dense molecular clouds occur-
ring in connection with H II regions. Almost ev-
ery molecule yet discovered has been detected in
Sagittarius B2 near the galactic centre. Another
very rich molecular cloud has been observed near
the H II region Orion A. In visible light this re-
gion has long been known as the Orion neb-
ula M42 (Fig. 16.18). Inside the actual H II re-
gions there are no molecules, since they would be
rapidly dissociated by the high temperature and
strong ultraviolet radiation. Three types of molec-
ular sources have been found near H II regions
(Fig. 16.21):
1. Large gas and dust envelopes around the H II
region.
2. Small dense clouds inside these envelopes.
3. Very compact OH and H2O maser sources.
The large envelopes have been discovered pri-
marily by CO observations. OH and H2CO have
also been detected. Like in the dark nebulae the
gas in these clouds is probably mainly molecular
hydrogen. Because of the large size and density
(n ≈103–104 molecules/cm3) of these clouds,
their masses are very large, 105 or even 106 solar

Above is an infrared source of about 0.5′′ diameter, the
Kleinmann–Low nebula (KL). BN is an infrared point
source, the Becklin–Neugebauer object. Other infrared
sources are denoted IRS. The large crosses indicate OH
masers and the small crosses H2O masers. On the scale

masses (Sgr B2). They are among the most mas-
sive objects in the Milky Way. The dust in molec-
ular clouds can be observed on the basis of its
thermal radiation. Its peak falls at wavelengths of
10–100 µm, corresponding to a dust temperature
of 30–300 K.
Some interstellar clouds contain very small
maser sources. In these the emission lines of OH,
H2O and SiO may be many million times stronger
than elsewhere. The diameter of the radiating re-
gions is only about 5–10 au. The conditions in
these clouds are such that radiation in some spec-
tral lines is ampliﬁed by stimulated emission as it
propagates through the cloud. Hydroxyl and wa-
ter masers occur in connection with dense H II
regions and infrared sources, and appear to be re-
lated to the formation of protostars. In addition
maser emission (OH, H2O and SiO) occurs in
connection with Mira variables and some red su-
pergiant stars. This maser emission comes from
a molecule and dust envelope around the star,
which also gives rise to an observable infrared ex-
cess.
16.4
The Formation of Protostars
The mass of the Milky Way is about 1011 solar
masses. Since its age is about 1010 years, stars
have been forming at the average rate of 10M⊙
per year. This estimate is only an upper limit for
the present rate, because earlier the rate of star
formation must have been much higher. Since
the lifetime of O stars is only about a million
years, a better estimate of the star formation rate
can be made, based on the observed number of
O stars. Accordingly, it has been concluded that at
present, new stars are forming in the Milky Way
at a rate of about three solar masses per year.
Stars are now believed to form inside large
dense interstellar clouds mostly located in the
spiral arms of the Galaxy. Under its own grav-
ity, a cloud begins to contract and fragment into
parts that will become protostars. The observa-
tions seem to indicate that stars are not formed
individually, but in larger groups. Young stars are

16.5
Planetary Nebulae
349
found in open clusters and in loose associations,
typically containing a few hundred stars which
must have formed simultaneously.
Theoretical calculations conﬁrm that the for-
mation of single stars is almost impossible. An
interstellar cloud can contract only if its mass is
large enough for gravity to overwhelm the pres-
sure. As early as in the 1920’s, James Jeans cal-
culated that a cloud with a certain temperature
and density can condense only if its mass is high
enough. If the mass is too small the pressure of
the gas is sufﬁcient to prevent the gravitational
contraction. The limiting mass is the Jeans mass
(Sect. 6.11), given by
MJ ≈3 × 104
	
T 3
n M⊙,
where n is the density in atoms/m3 and T the tem-
perature.
In a typical interstellar neutral hydrogen cloud
n = 106 and T = 100 K, giving the Jeans mass,
30,000M⊙. In the densest dark clouds n = 1012
and T = 10 K and hence, MJ = 1M⊙.
It is thought that star formation begins in
clouds of a few thousand solar masses and diam-
eters of about 10 pc. The cloud begins to contract,
but does not heat up because the liberated energy
is carried away by radiation. As the density in-
creases, the Jeans mass thus decreases. Because
of this, separate condensation nuclei are formed
in the cloud, which go on contracting indepen-
dently: the cloud fragments. Fragmentation is fur-
ther advanced by the increasing rotation velocity.
The original cloud has a certain angular momen-
tum which is conserved during the contraction;
thus the angular velocity must increase.
This contraction and fragmentation continues
until the density becomes so high that the individ-
ual fragments become optically thick. The energy
liberated by the contraction can then no longer
escape, and the temperature will begin to rise. In
consequence the Jeans mass begins to increase,
further fragmentation ceases and the rising pres-
sure in existing fragments stops their contrac-
tion. Some of the protostars formed in this way
may still be rotating too rapidly. These may split
into two, thus forming double systems. The fur-
ther evolution of protostars has been described in
Sect. 11.2.
Although the view that stars are formed by
the collapse of interstellar clouds is generally ac-
cepted, many details of the fragmentation process
are still highly conjectural. Thus the effects of ro-
tation, magnetic ﬁelds and energy input are very
imperfectly known. Why a cloud begins to con-
tract is also not certain; one theory is that passage
through a spiral arm compresses clouds and trig-
gers contraction (see Sect. 17.4). This would ex-
plain why young stars are predominantly found in
the spiral arms of the Milky Way and other galax-
ies. The contraction of an interstellar cloud might
also be initiated by a nearby expanding H II re-
gion or supernova explosion.
Star formation can be observed particularly
well in the infrared, since the temperatures of the
condensing clouds and protostars are of the or-
der 100–1000 K and the infrared radiation can
escape even the densest dust clouds. For exam-
ple, in connection with the Orion nebula there is
a large cloud of hydrogen, found in radio obser-
vations, containing small infrared sources. E.g.
the Becklin–Neugebauer object has a temperature
of a couple of hundred kelvins but a luminosity
that is thousandfold compared with the Sun. It is
a strong H2O maser source, located next to a large
H II region.
16.5
Planetary Nebulae
Bright regions of ionised gas do not occur only
in connection with newly formed stars, but also
around stars in late stages of their evolution.
The planetary nebulae are gas shells around
small hot blue stars. As we have seen in con-
nection with stellar evolution, instabilities may
develop at the stage of helium burning. Some
stars begin to pulsate, while in others the whole
outer atmosphere may be violently ejected into
space. In the latter case, a gas shell expanding at
20–30 km/s will be formed around a small and
hot (50,000–100,000 K) star, the core of the orig-
inal star.
The expanding gas in a planetary nebula is
ionised by ultraviolet radiation from the central

star, and its spectrum contains many of the same
bright emission lines as that of an H II region.
Planetary nebulae are, however, generally much
more symmetrical in shape than most H II re-
gions, and they expand more rapidly. For exam-
ple, the well-known Ring nebula in Lyra (M57)
has expanded visibly in photographs taken at
50-year intervals. In a few ten thousand years, the
planetary nebulae disappear in the general inter-
stellar medium and their central stars cool to be-
come white dwarfs.
The planetary nebulae were given their name
in the 19th century, because certain small nebulae
visually look quite like planets such as Uranus.
The apparent diameter of the smallest known
planetary nebulae is only a few arc seconds,
whereas the largest ones (like the Helix nebula)
may be one degree in diameter (Fig. 16.22).
The brightest emission lines are often due to
forbidden transitions, like in H II regions. For ex-
ample, the green colour of the central parts of
the Ring nebula in Lyra is due to the forbid-
den lines of doubly ionised oxygen at 495.9 and
500.7 nm. The red colour of the outer parts is due
to the hydrogen Balmer α line (656.3 nm) and
the forbidden lines of ionised nitrogen (654.8 nm,
658.3 nm).
The total number of planetary nebulae in the
Milky Way has been estimated to be 50,000.
About 2000 have actually been observed.
16.6
Supernova Remnants
In Chap. 11 we have seen that massive stars end
their evolution in a supernova explosion. The col-
lapse of the stellar core leads to the violent ejec-
tion of the outer layers, which then remain as an
expanding gas cloud.
About 120 supernova remnants (SNR’s) have
been discovered in the Milky Way. Some of them
are optically visible as a ring or an irregular neb-
ula (e.g. the Crab nebula; see Fig. 16.23), but
most are detectable only in the radio region (be-
cause radio emission suffers no extinction).
In the radio region the SNR’s are extended
sources similar to H II regions. However, unlike
H II regions the radiation from SNR’s is often
polarised. Another characteristic difference be-
tween these two kinds of sources is that whereas
the radio brightness of H II regions grows or re-
mains constant as the frequency increases, that of
SNR’s falls off almost linearly (in a logIν −logν
diagram) with increasing frequency (Fig. 16.24).
These differences are due to the different
emission processes in H II regions and in SNR’s.

red wavelengths. The

radio source. Its energy
source is the central rapidly
rotating neutron star,
pulsar, which is the
collapsed core of the
original star. (Palomar

Fig. 16.24 The radio spectra of typical H II regions and
supernova remnants. The radiation of H II regions is ther-
mal and obeys the Rayleigh–Jeans law, I ∝ν2, at wave-
lengths larger than 1 m. In supernova remnants the in-
tensity decreases with increasing frequency. (After Schef-
ﬂer, H., Elsässer, H. (1987): Physics of the Galaxy and
the Interstellar Matter (Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New
York))
In an H II region, the radio emission is free–free
radiation from the hot plasma. In a SNR it is
synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons
moving in spiral orbits around the magnetic ﬁeld
lines. The synchrotron process gives rise to a con-
tinuous spectrum extending over all wavelength
regions. For example, the Crab nebula looks blue
or green in colour photographs because of optical
synchrotron radiation.
In the Crab nebula red ﬁlaments are also visi-
ble against the bright background. Their emission
is principally in the hydrogen Hα line. The hy-
drogen in a SNR is not ionised by a central star
as in the H II regions, but by the ultraviolet syn-
chrotron radiation.
The supernova remnants in the Milky Way fall
into two classes. One type has a clearly ring-like
structure (e.g. Cassiopeia A or the Veil nebula in
Cygnus; see Fig. 16.25); another is irregular and
bright at the middle (like the Crab nebula). In the
remnants of the Crab nebula type there is always
a rapidly rotating pulsar at the centre. This pulsar
provides most of the energy of the remnant by
continuously injecting relativistic electrons into
the cloud. The evolution of this type of SNR re-
ﬂects that of the pulsar and for this reason has
a time scale of a few ten thousand years.
Ring-like SNR’s do not contain an energetic
pulsar; their energy comes from the actual super-
nova explosion. After the explosion, the cloud ex-
pands at a speed of 10,000–20,000 km/s. About

nebula (NGC 6960 at the

in Cygnus is the remnant of
a supernova explosion
which occurred several ten
thousand years ago. (Mt.
Wilson Observatory)
50–100 years after the explosion the remnant be-
gins to form a spherical shell as the ejected gas
starts to sweep up interstellar gas and to slow
down in its outer parts. The swept-up shell ex-
pands with a decreasing velocity and cools until,
after about 100,000 years, it merges into the inter-
stellar medium. The two types of supernova rem-
nants may be related to the two types (I and II) of
supernovae.
Box 16.1 (Synchrotron Radiation) Synchro-
tron radiation was ﬁrst observed in 1948 by
Frank Elder, Robert Langmuir and Herbert
Pollack, who were experimenting with an elec-
tron synchrotron, in which electrons were ac-
celerated to relativistic energies in a magnetic
ﬁeld. It was observed that the electrons radi-
ated visible light in a narrow cone along their
momentary direction of motion. In astrophysics
synchrotron radiation was ﬁrst invoked as an
explanation of the radio emission of the Milky
Way, discovered by Karl Jansky in 1931. This
radiation had a spectrum and a large metre-
wave brightness temperature (more than 105 K)
which were inconsistent with ordinary ther-
mal free-free emission from ionised gas. In
1950 Hannes Alfvén and Nicolai Herlofson as
well as Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer proposed that
the galactic radio background was due to syn-
chrotron radiation. According to Kiepenheuer
the high-energy cosmic ray electrons would
emit radio radiation in the weak galactic mag-

16.7

netic ﬁeld. This explanation has turned out to
be correct. Synchrotron radiation is also an
important emission process in supernova rem-
nants, radio galaxies and quasars. It is a non-
thermal radiation process, i.e. the energy of the
radiating electrons is not due to thermal mo-
tions.
The emission of synchrotron radiation. A charged par-
ticle (electron) propagating in a magnetic ﬁeld moves
in a spiral. Because of the centripetal acceleration, the
particle emits electromagnetic radiation
The origin of synchrotron radiation is
schematically shown in the ﬁgure. The mag-
netic ﬁeld forces the electron to move in a spi-
ral orbit. The electron is thus constantly accel-
erated and will emit electromagnetic radiation.
According to the special theory of relativity,
the emission from a relativistic electron will be
concentrated in a narrow cone. Like the beam
from a lighthouse, this cone sweeps across the
observer’s ﬁeld of vision once for each revo-
lution. Thus the observer sees a sequence of
radiation ﬂashes of very short duration com-
pared with their interval. (In the total emis-
sion of a large number of electrons, separate
ﬂashes cannot be distinguished.) When this se-
ries of pulses is represented as a sum of differ-
ent frequency components (Fourier transform),
a broad spectrum is obtained with a maximum
at
νmax = aB⊥E2,
where B⊥is the magnetic ﬁeld component per-
pendicular to the velocity of the electron, and E
its energy, a is a constant of proportionality.
The table gives the frequency and wave-
length of the maximum as functions of the
electron energy for the typical galactic ﬁeld

To produce even radio synchrotron radia-
tion, very energetic electrons are required, but
these are known to be present in the cosmic ra-
diation. In the optical galactic background radi-
ation, the contribution from synchrotron radia-
tion is negligible, but, for example, in the Crab
nebula, a signiﬁcant part of the optical emission
is due to this mechanism.
16.7
The Hot Corona of the Milky
Way
As early as 1956 Lyman Spitzer showed that the
Milky Way has to be surrounded by a large en-
velope of very hot gas (Fig. 16.26). Almost two
decades later the Copernicus satellite, whose sci-
entiﬁc program was directed by Spitzer, found
evidence for this kind of gas, which began to
be called galactic coronal gas, in analogy with
the solar corona. The satellite observed emis-
sion lines of e.g. ﬁve times ionised oxygen
(O VI), four times ionised nitrogen (N V) and
triply ionised carbon (C IV). The formation of
these lines requires a high temperature (100,000–
1,000,000 K), and a high temperature is also in-
dicated by the broadening of the lines.
Galactic coronal gas is distributed through
the whole Milky Way and extends several thou-
sand parsecs from the galactic plane. Its den-
sity is only of the order of 10−3 atoms/cm3 (re-
call that the mean density in the galactic plane
is 1 atom/cm3). Thus coronal gas forms a kind
of background sea, from which the denser and
cooler forms of interstellar matter, such as neu-
tral hydrogen and molecular clouds, rise as is-
lands. In the early 1980’s the IUE satellite also

detected similar coronae in the Large Magellanic
Cloud and in the spiral galaxy M100. Coronal gas
is probably quite a common and important form
of matter in galaxies.
Supernova explosions are probably the source
of both coronal gas and its energy. When a super-
nova explodes, it forms a hot bubble in the sur-
rounding medium. The bubbles from neighbour-
ing supernovae will expand and merge, forming
a foamlike structure. In addition to supernovae,
stellar winds from hot stars may provide some of
the energy of the coronal gas.
16.8
Cosmic Rays and the
Interstellar Magnetic Field
Cosmic Rays
Elementary particles and atomic
nuclei reaching the Earth from space are called
cosmic rays. They occur throughout interstellar
space with an energy density of the same order
of magnitude as that of the radiation from stars.
Cosmic rays are therefore important for the ioni-
sation and heating of interstellar gas.
Since cosmic rays are charged, their direction
of propagation in space is constantly changed
by the magnetic ﬁeld. Their direction of arrival
therefore gives no information about their place
of origin. The most important properties of cos-
mic rays that can be observed from the Earth
are their particle composition and energy distri-
bution. As noted in Sect. 3.6, these observations
have to be made in the upper atmosphere or from
satellites, since cosmic ray particles are destroyed
in the atmosphere.
The main constituent of the cosmic rays (about
90 %) is hydrogen nuclei or protons. The second
most important constituent (about 9 %) is helium
nuclei or α particles. The rest of the particles are
electrons and nuclei more massive than helium.
Most cosmic rays have an energy smaller than
109 eV. The number of more energetic particles
drops rapidly with increasing energy. The most
energetic protons have an energy of 1020 eV, but
such particles are very rare—the energy of one
such proton could lift this book about one cen-
timetre. (The largest particle accelerators reach
“only” energies of 1012 eV.)
The distribution of low-energy (less than
108 eV) cosmic rays cannot be reliably deter-
mined from the Earth, since solar “cosmic rays”,
high-energy protons and electrons formed in so-
lar ﬂares ﬁll the solar system and strongly affect
the motion of low-energy cosmic rays.

with polarisation smaller than 0.08 % are indicated by

R.A.S. 74, 139)
The distribution of cosmic rays in the Milky
Way can be directly inferred from gamma-ray and
radio observations. The collisions of cosmic ray
protons with interstellar hydrogen atoms gives
rise to pions which then decay to form a gamma-
ray background. The radio background is formed
by cosmic ray electrons which emit synchrotron
radiation in the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld.
Both radio and gamma-ray emission are stron-
gly concentrated in the galactic plane. From this
it has been concluded that the sources of cosmic
rays must also be located in the galactic plane. In
addition there are individual peaks in the back-
grounds around known supernova remnants. In
the gamma-ray region such peaks are observed at
e.g. the Crab nebula and the Vela pulsar; in the ra-
dio region the North Polar Spur is a large, nearby
ring-like region of enhanced emission.
Apparently a large fraction of cosmic rays
have their origin in supernovae. An actual super-
nova explosion will give rise to energetic parti-
cles. If a pulsar is formed, observations show that
it will accelerate particles in its surroundings. Fi-
nally the shock waves formed in the expanding
supernova remnant will also give rise to relativis-
tic particles.
On the basis of the relative abundances of var-
ious cosmic ray nuclei, it can be calculated how
far they have travelled before reaching the Earth.
It has been found that typical cosmic ray protons
have travelled for a period of a few million years
(and hence also a distance of a few million light-
years) from their point of origin. Since the diame-
ter of the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years,
the protons have crossed the Milky Way tens of
times in the galactic ﬁeld.
The Interstellar Magnetic Field
The strength
and direction of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld are
difﬁcult to determine reliably. Direct measure-
ments are impossible, since the magnetic ﬁelds
of the Earth and the Sun are much stronger. How-
ever, using various sources it has been possible to
deduce the existence and strength of the ﬁeld.
We have already seen that interstellar grains
give rise to interstellar polarisation. In order to
polarise light, the dust grains have to be similarly
oriented; this can only be achieved by a general
magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 16.27 shows the distribu-
tion of interstellar polarisation over the sky. Stars
near each other generally have the same polarisa-
tion. At low galactic latitudes the polarisation is
almost parallel to the galactic plane, except where
one is looking along a spiral arm.
More precise estimates of the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld can be obtained from the rotation
of the plane of polarisation of the radio radia-
tion from distant sources. This Faraday rotation is
proportional to the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld
and to the electron density. Another method is to

356
16
The Interstellar Medium
measure the Zeeman splitting of the 21 cm radio
line. These measurements have fairly consistently
given a value of 10−10–10−9 T for the strength of
the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld. This is about one
millionth of the interplanetary ﬁeld in the solar
system.
16.9
Examples
Example 16.1
Estimate the dust grain size and
number density in the galactic plane.
Let us compare the interstellar extinction
curve in Fig. 16.4(b) with the Mie scattering
curves in Fig. 16.3. We see that the leftmost
parts of the curves may correspond to each
other: the interval 0 < x < 5 with m = 1.5 in
Fig. 16.3 matches the interval 0 < 1/λ < 5 µm−1
in Fig. 16.4(b). Remembering that x = 2πa/λ,
this suggests a constant grain radius a, given by
2πa ≈1 µm, or a ≈0.16 µm.
In the blue wavelength region (λ = 0.44 µm),
x = 2.3 and, according to the upper Fig. 16.3,
Qext ≈2. Using A = 2 mag for the interstellar ex-
tinction at r = 1 kpc, we get, substituting (16.5)
into (16.7), n ≈4 × 10−7 m−3. This should give
the order of magnitude of the interstellar dust
density.
As a summary we could say that a consider-
able fraction of the interstellar extinction might
be due to grains of diameter 0.3 µm and particle
density of the order of 10−7 m−3 = 100 km−3.
Example 16.2
Estimate the time interval be-
tween successive collisions of a hydrogen atom
in interstellar gas.
Two atoms will collide if the separation be-
tween their centres becomes less than 2r, where
r is the radius of the atom. Thus, the microscopic
cross section for the collision is σ = π(2r)2 =
4πr2. The macroscopic cross section, or the num-
ber of collisions of an H atom per unit length, is
then Σ = nσ, where n is the number density of
the H atoms. The mean free path l of an atom
is the inverse of the macroscopic cross section,
l = 1/Σ, and the time between two collisions is
t = l/v, where v is the velocity of the atom.
Considering the numerical values, the Bohr ra-
dius of an H atom is r = 5.3 × 10−11 m. Taking
n = 1 cm−3 we get l = 2.8×1013 m ≈0.0009 pc.
The average velocity is not far from the root mean
square velocity at T = 125 K, given by (5.33):
v =

3kT
m
= 1760 ms−1.
These values of l and v give t = l/v = 510 years
for the collision interval. Taking into account the
velocity distribution in the gas, the mean free path
appears to be shorter by a factor of 1/
√
2, which
reduces the time to about 400 years.
Example 16.3
Consider the lowest rotational
transition of the CO molecule. For 12CO the fre-
quency of this line is ν(12CO) = 115.27 GHz,
and for 13CO, ν(13CO) = 110.20 GHz. Estimate
the optical thickness of each line in a molec-
ular cloud, where the observed brightness tem-
peratures of the lines are Tb(12CO) = 40 K and
Tb(13CO) = 9 K.
For the 12CO line, hν/k = 5.5 K. Thus, the
Rayleigh–Jeans approximation is valid if the tem-
perature is considerably higher than 5 K. This is
not always the case, but the measured value of
Tb(12CO) suggests that the approximation can be
used.
Ignoring the background, (16.19) gives
Tb = Texc

1 −e−τν
.
The optical thickness τν is proportional to the
opacity or the absorption coefﬁcient αν [see
(4.16)], and αν is evidently proportional to the
number of CO molecules present. Other differ-
ences between the lines are small, so we can write
τν(12CO)
τν(13CO) ≈n(12CO)
n(13CO).
Adopting the terrestrial value n(12CO)/n(13CO)
= 89, we set

would be practically equal, and the optical thick-

Star Clusters and Associations
Several collections of stars can be picked out in
the sky, even with the naked eye. Closer study re-
veals that they really do form separate clusters in
space. E.g. the Pleiades in Taurus and the Hyades
around Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus,
are such open star clusters. Almost the whole of
the constellation Coma Berenices is also an open
star cluster. Many objects appearing as nebulous
patches to the unaided eye, when looked at with
a telescope, turn out to be star clusters, like Prae-
sepe in the constellation Cancer, or double cluster
in Perseus (Fig. 17.1). In addition to open clusters
some apparently nebulous objects are very dense
globular clusters, such as those in Hercules and
in Canes Venatici (Fig. 17.2).
The ﬁrst catalogue of star clusters was pre-
pared by the French astronomer Charles Messier
in 1784. The ﬁrst version contained only 45
objects, but later Messier himself and Pierre
Méchain expanded the catalogue to include 103
objects. Later seven more objects were added,
possibly observed by Messier. Messier was inter-
ested in comets, not in those fuzzy objects, and
the reason for the catalogue was to avoid false
alarms. The catalogue contains a mixture of very
different objects, like about 30 globular clusters
and the same number of open clusters, gas nebu-
lae and galaxies.
A larger catalogue, published in 1888, was the
New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clus-
ters of Stars prepared by the Danish astronomer
John Louis Emil Dreyer. The catalogue numbers
of objects in this list are preceded by the initials
NGC. For example, the large globular cluster in
Hercules is object M13 in the Messier catalogue,
and it is also known as NGC 6205. The NGC cat-
alogue was supplemented with the Index Cata-
logue in 1895 and 1910. The objects of this cata-
logue are given the initials IC.
With a small telescope stars of distant clus-
ters and galaxies cannot be distinguished as sep-
arate objects; instead the target looks nebulous.
Therefore their true nature was only little by lit-
tle with spectroscopy and large telescopes. That’s
why those old catalogues contain all kinds of dif-
ferent objects.
Even now there is no catalogue of open clus-
ter complete to some limiting magnitude. The
data are collected from several catalogues pub-
lished by various astronomers, and therefore the
nomenclature is not consistent. The problem is
that open clusters concentrate close the plane of
Milky Way, and there are a lot of background
stars. Thus identifying the cluster members may
require rather detailed studies of the properties of
the stars. Also the members may already have dis-
persed to a very wide area making it difﬁcult to
decide which of them belong to the same clus-
ter.
17.1
Associations
In 1947 the Soviet astronomer Viktor Amaza-
spovich Ambartsumyan discovered that there are
groups of young stars scattered over so large re-
gions of the sky that they would be very difﬁcult
to identify merely on the basis of their appear-
ance. These associations may have a few tens of

members. One association is found around the
star ζ Persei, and in the region of Orion, there are
several associations.
Associations are groups of very young stars.
They are usually identiﬁed on the basis either
of absolutely bright main sequence stars or of
T Tauri stars. According to the type, one speaks
of OB associations and T Tauri associations. The
most massive stars of spectral class O stay on the
main sequence for only a few million years, and
therefore associations containing them are neces-
sarily young. The T Tauri stars are even younger
stars that are in the process of contracting towards
the main sequence.
Studies of the internal motions in associations
show that they are rapidly dispersing. There are
so few stars in an association that their gravity
cannot hold them together for any length of time.
The observed motions have often conﬁrmed that
the stars in an association were very close to-
gether a few million years ago (Fig. 17.3).
Large amounts of interstellar matter, gas and
dust nebulae often occur in connection with asso-
ciations, supplying information about the connec-
tion between star formation and the interstellar
medium. Infrared observations have shown that
stars are now forming or have recently formed in
many dense interstellar clouds.
Associations are strongly concentrated in the
spiral arms in the plane of the Milky Way. Both in
the Orion region and in the direction of Cepheus,
three generations of associations have been iden-

17.2
Open Star Clusters
Open clusters usually contain from a few tens to
a few hundreds of stars. The kinetic energy of
the cluster members, the differential rotation of
the Milky Way (Sect. 17.3) and external gravita-
tional disturbances tend to gradually disperse the
open clusters. Still, many of them are fairly per-
manent; for example, the Pleiades is many hun-
dreds of millions of years old, but nevertheless,
quite a dense cluster.
The distances of star clusters—and also of
associations—can be obtained from the photo-

362

Star Clusters and Associations
metric or spectroscopic distances of their bright-
est members. For the nearest clusters, in partic-
ular for the Hyades, one can use the method of
kinematic parallaxes, which is based on the fact
that the stars in a cluster all have the same average
space velocity with respect to the Sun. The proper
motions in the Hyades are shown in Fig. 17.4.
They all appear to be directed to the same point.
Figure 17.5 explains how this convergence can be
understood as an effect of perspective, if all clus-
ter members have the same velocity vector with
respect to the observer. Let θ be the angular dis-
tance of a given star from the convergence point.
The angle between the velocity of the star and

(van Bueren, H.G. (1952): Bull. Astr. Inst. Neth. 11)
Fig. 17.5 If all stars move in the same direction, their tan-
gential velocity components appear to be directed towards
the convergence point K
the line of sight will then also be θ. The veloc-
ity components along the line of sight and at right
angles to it, vr and vt, are therefore given by
vr = v cosθ,
vt = v sinθ.
(17.1)
The radial velocity vr can be measured from the
Doppler shift of the stellar spectrum. The tangen-
tial velocity vt is related to the proper motion μ
and the distance r:
vt = μr.
(17.2)
Thus the distance can be calculated:
r = vt
μ = v sinθ
μ
= vr
μ tanθ.
(17.3)
By means of this method, the distances of the
individual stars can be determined from the mo-
tion of the cluster as a whole. Since the method
of (ground-based) trigonometric parallaxes is re-
liable only out to a distance of 30 pc, the mov-
ing cluster method is an indispensable way of de-
termining stellar distances. The distance of the
Hyades obtained in this way is about 40 pc. The
distance obtained from the trigonometric paral-
laxes measured directly by the Hipparcos satellite
in the 1990’s is 46 pc. The Hyades is the nearest
open cluster.
The observed HR diagram or the correspond-
ing colour–magnitude diagram of the Hyades
and other nearby star clusters show a very well-
deﬁned and narrow main sequence (Fig. 17.6).
Most of the cluster members are main sequence
stars; there are only a few giants. There are quite
a few stars slightly less than one magnitude above
the main sequence. These are apparently binary
stars whose components have not been resolved.
To see this, let us consider a binary, where both
components have the same magnitude m and the
same colour index. If this system is unresolved,
the colour index will still be the same, but the ob-
served magnitude will be m −0.75, i.e. slightly
less than one magnitude brighter.
The main sequences of open clusters are gen-
erally located in the same section of the HR or
colour-magnitude diagram (Fig. 17.7). This is be-
cause the material from which the clusters formed

Fig. 17.7 Schematic colour–magnitude diagrams of star
clusters. M3 is a globular cluster; the others are open clus-
ters. Cluster ages are shown along the main sequence. The
age of a cluster can be told from the point where its stars
begin to turn off the main sequence. (Sandage, A. (1956):
Publ. Astron. Soc. Pac. 68, 498)
has not varied much, i.e. their initial chemical
composition has been fairly constant. In younger
clusters the main sequence extends to brighter
and hotter stars and earlier spectral types. Usu-
ally one can clearly see the point in the diagram
where the main sequence ends and bends over to-
wards the giant branch. This point will depend
very strongly on the age of the cluster. It can
therefore be used in determining the ages of open
clusters. Star clusters are of central importance in
the study of stellar evolution.
The colour–magnitude diagrams of star clus-
ters can also be used to determine their distances.
The method is called main sequence ﬁtting. By
means of multicolour photometry the reddening
due to interstellar dust can be removed from the
observed colours B −V of the stars, yielding the
intrinsic colours (B −V )0. Most star clusters are
so far away from us that all cluster members can
be taken to be at the same distance. The distance
modulus
mV0 −MV = 5lg
r
10 pc
(17.4)
will then be the same for all members. In (17.4),
mV0 is the apparent, MV the absolute visual mag-
nitude of a star, and r the distance. It has been
assumed that the extinction due to interstellar
dust AV has been determined from multicolour
photometry and its effect removed from the ob-
served visual magnitude mV:
mV0 = mV −AV.
When the observed colour–magnitude dia-
gram of the cluster is plotted using the apparent
magnitude mV0 rather than the absolute magni-
tude MV on the vertical axis, the only change
will be that the position of the main sequence
is shifted vertically by an amount correspond-
ing to the distance modulus. The observed (mV0,
(B −V )0) diagram may now be compared with
the Hyades (MV, (B −V )0) diagram used as
a standard. By demanding that the main se-
quences of the two diagrams agree, the distance
modulus and hence the distance can be deter-
mined. The method is very accurate and efﬁcient.
It can be used to determine cluster distances out
to many kiloparsecs.
17.3
Globular Star Clusters
Globular star clusters usually contain about 105
stars. The distribution of the stars is spherically

364
17
Star Clusters and Associations
symmetric, and the central densities are about ten
times larger than in open clusters. Stars in glob-
ular clusters are among the oldest in the Milky
Way, and therefore they are of great importance
for studies of stellar evolution. There are about
150–200 globular clusters in the Milky Way.
The colour-magnitude diagram of a typical
globular cluster is shown in Fig. 17.8. The main
sequence only contains faint red stars; there is
a prominent giant branch, and the horizontal and
asymptotic branches are clearly seen. The main
sequence is lower than that of the open clusters,
because the metal abundance is much lower in the
globular clusters.
The horizontal branch stars have a known ab-
solute magnitude, which has been calibrated us-
ing principally RR Lyrae type variables. Because
the horizontal branch stars are bright, they can
be observed even in distant clusters, and thus us-
ing them the distances of globular clusters can be
well determined.
Using the known distances, the linear sizes of
globular clusters can be calculated. It is found
that most of the mass is concentrated to a central
core with a radius of about 0.3–10 pc. Outside
this there is an extended envelope with a radius
that may be 10–100 times larger. At even larger
radii stars will escape from the cluster because of
the tidal force of the Galaxy.

cluster M5. In addition to the main sequence one can see
the giant branch bending to the right and to its left the hor-
izontal brunch. (Arp, H. (1962): Astrophys. J. 135, 311)
The masses of globular clusters can be roughly
estimated from the virial theorem, if the stel-
lar velocities in the cluster have been measured.
More precise values are calculated by ﬁtting theo-
retical models to the observed density and veloc-
ity distributions. In this way masses in the range
104–106 M⊙have been obtained.
The globular clusters in the Milky Way fall
into two classes. In the classiﬁcation given in
Table 18.1 these correspond to intermediate and
halo population II. The disk globular clusters are
concentrated towards the centre and the plane of
the Milky Way and they form a system that is
rotating with the general rotation of the Milky
Way. In contrast, the halo clusters are almost
spherically distributed in an extensive distribution
reaching out to at least 35 kpc. The system of halo
clusters does not rotate, but instead the velocities
of individual clusters are uniformly distributed in
all directions. The abundance of heavy elements
is also different in the two classes of clusters. For
disk clusters it is typically about 30 % of the so-
lar value, for halo clusters it is only about 1 %. In
some clusters the heavy element abundances are
only 10−3 times the solar value. The smallest val-
ues, as low as 10−4–10−5 have been detected in
some ﬁeld stars of the halo. They therefore give
important information about the production of el-
ements in the early Universe and during the for-
mation of the Milky Way.
All globular clusters are old, and the halo clus-
ters are among the oldest known astronomical ob-
jects. Determining a precise age is difﬁcult, and
requires both accurate observations of the turn-
off point of the main sequence in the HR dia-
gram, as well detailed theoretical stellar evolu-
tion models. The ages obtained have been about
13 × 109 years. This age is close to the age of
the Universe calculated from its rate of expansion
(see Chap. 20).

something about the stability of the cluster?

stars in the cluster, and the average distance
of each pair is R. Thus the potential energy is

where m = 1M⊙. The kinetic energy is

The Milky Way
On clear, moonless nights a nebulous band of
light can be seen stretching across the sky. This
is the Milky Way (Fig. 18.1). The name is used
both for the phenomenon in the sky and for the
large stellar system causing it. The Milky Way
system is also called the Galaxy—with a capital
letter. The general term galaxy is used to refer to
the countless stellar systems more or less like our
Milky Way.
The band of the Milky Way extends round the
whole celestial sphere. It is a huge system con-
sisting mostly of stars, among them the Sun. The
stars of the Milky Way form a ﬂattened disk-like
system. In the direction of the plane of the disk
huge numbers of stars are visible, whereas rela-
tively few are seen in the perpendicular direction.
The faint light of distant stars merges into a uni-
form glow, and therefore the Milky Way appears
as a nebulous band to the naked eye. A long-
exposure photograph reveals hundreds of thou-
sands of stars (Fig. 18.2).
In the early 17th century Galileo Galilei, us-
ing his ﬁrst telescope, discovered that the Milky
Way consists of innumerable stars. Already in
the late 18th century William Herschel attempted
to determine the size and shape of the Milky
Way by means of star counts. Only early in the
20th century did the Dutch astronomer Jacobus
Kapteyn obtain the ﬁrst estimate of the size of
the Milky Way. The true size of the Milky Way
and the Sun’s position in it became clear ﬁnally
in the 1920’s from Harlow Shapley’s studies of
the space distribution of globular clusters.
In studying the structure of the Milky Way, it is
convenient to choose a spherical coordinate sys-
tem so that the fundamental plane is the symme-
try plane of the Milky Way. This is deﬁned as the
symmetry plane of the distribution of neutral hy-
drogen, and it agrees quite closely with the sym-
metry plane deﬁned by the distribution of stars in
the solar neighbourhood (within a few kpc).
The basic direction in the fundamental plane
has been chosen to be the direction of the centre
of the Milky Way. This is located in the constella-
tion Sagittarius (α = 17 h 45.7 min, δ = −29◦00′,
epoch 2000.0) at a distance of about 8.5 kpc. The
galactic latitude is counted from the plane of the
Galaxy to its pole, going from 0◦to + 90◦, and
to the galactic south pole, from 0◦to −90◦. The
galactic coordinate system is shown in Fig. 18.3
(see also Sect. 2.8).
18.1
Methods of Distance
Measurement
In order to study the structure of the Milky Way,
one needs to know how various kinds of objects,
such as stars, star clusters and interstellar matter,
are distributed in space. The most important ways
of measuring the distances will ﬁrst be consid-
ered.
Trigonometric Parallaxes
The method of tri-
gonometric parallaxes is based on the apparent
yearly back-and-forth movement of stars in the
sky, caused by the orbital motion of the Earth.

Observatory)
From Earth-based observations the trigonometric
parallaxes can be reliably measured out to a dis-
tance of about 30 pc; beyond 100 pc this method
is no longer useful. The situation is, however,
changing. The limit has already been pushed to
a few hundred parsecs by the Hipparcos satellite,
and Gaia will mean another major leap in the ac-
curacy.
The Motion of the Sun with Respect to the
Neighbouring Stars. The Local Standard of
Rest
The motion of the Sun with respect to the
neighbouring stars is reﬂected in their proper mo-
tions and radial velocities (Fig. 18.4). The point
towards which the Sun’s motion among the stars
seems to be directed is called the apex. The op-
posite point is the antapex. The stars near the
apex appear to be approaching; their radial veloc-
ities have the largest negative values, on the av-
erage. In the direction of the antapex the largest
(positive) radial velocities are observed. On the
great circle perpendicular to the apex-antapex di-
rection, the radial velocities are zero on the aver-
age, but the proper motions are large. The average
proper motions decrease towards the apex and the
antapex, but always point from the apex towards
the antapex.
In order to study the true motions of the stars,
one has to deﬁne a coordinate system with respect
to which the motions are to be deﬁned. The most
practical frame of reference is deﬁned so that the
stars in the solar neighbourhood are at rest, on
the average. More precisely, this local standard
of rest (LSR) is deﬁned as follows.
Let us suppose the velocities of the stars be-
ing considered are distributed at random. Their
velocities with respect to the Sun, i.e. their radial
velocities, proper motions and distances, are as-
sumed to be known. The local standard of rest is
then deﬁned so that the mean value of the veloc-
ity vectors is opposite to the velocity of the Sun
with respect to the LSR. Clearly the mean veloc-
ity of the relevant stars with respect to the LSR
will then be zero. The motion of the Sun with re-
spect to the LSR is found to be:
Apex coordinates
α = 18 h00 min = 270◦
l = 56◦
δ = +30◦
b = +23◦
Solar velocity
v0 = 19.7 kms−1
The apex is located in the constellation of Her-
cules. When the sample of stars used to deter-
mine the LSR is restricted to a subset of all the

stars in the solar neighbourhood, e.g. to stars of
a given spectral class, the sample will usually
have slightly different kinematic properties, and
the coordinates of the solar apex will change cor-
respondingly.
The velocity of an individual star with respect
to the local standard of rest is called the pecu-
liar motion of the star. The peculiar velocity of
a star is obtained by adding the velocity of the
Sun with respect to the LSR to the measured ve-
locity. Naturally the velocities should be treated
as vectors.
The local standard of rest is at rest only with
respect to a close neighbourhood of the Sun. The
Sun and the nearby stars, and thus also the LSR,
are moving round the centre of the Milky Way at
a speed that is ten times greater than the typical
peculiar velocities of stars in the solar neighbour-
hood (Fig. 18.5).
Statistical Parallaxes
The velocity of the Sun
with respect to neighbouring stars is about
20 km s−1. This means that in one year, the Sun
moves about 4 au with respect to the stars.
Let us consider a star S (Fig. 18.6), whose an-
gular distance from the apex is ϑ and which is at
a distance r from the Sun. In a time interval t the
star will move away from the apex at the angular
velocity u/t = μA because of the solar motion.
In the same time interval, the Sun will move the

distance s. The sine theorem for triangles yields
r ≈r′ = s sinϑ

,
(18.1)
because the distance remains nearly unchanged
and the angle u is very small. In addition to the
component μA due to solar motion, the observed
proper motion has a component due to the pe-
culiar velocity of the star. This can be removed

North galactic pole (NGP) in equatorial coordinates. The
galactic longitude l is measured from the galactic centre
along the galactic plane. The coordinates of the Galactic
centre are precessed from the deﬁning equinox 1950 and
are not very accurate (see A.P. Lane (1979), PASP, 91,
405)
Fig. 18.4 Because of the motion of the Sun towards the
apex, the average radial velocity of the nearby stars ap-
pears largest in the apex and antapex directions
by taking an average of (18.1) for a sample of
stars, since the peculiar velocities of the stars in
the solar neighbourhood can be assumed to be
randomly distributed. By observing the average
proper motion of objects known to be at the same
distance one thus obtains their actual distance.
A similar statistical method can be applied to ra-
dial velocities.
Objects that are at the same distance can be
found as follows. We know that the distance mod-
ulus m−M and the distance r are related accord-
ing to:
m −M = 5lg(r/10 pc) + A(r),
(18.2)
where A is the interstellar extinction. Thus ob-
jects that have the same apparent and the same
absolute magnitude will be at the same distance.
It should be noted that we need not know the ab-
solute magnitude as long as it is the same for all
stars in the sample. Suitable classes of stars are

main sequence A4 stars, RR Lyrae variables and
classical cepheids with some given period. The
stars in a cluster are also all at the same distance.
This method has been used, for example, to de-
termine the distance to the Hyades as explained
in Sect. 17.2.
Parallaxes based on the peculiar or apex mo-
tion of the Sun are called statistical or secular par-
allaxes.
Main Sequence Fitting
If the distance of a
cluster is known, it is possible to plot its HR dia-
gram with the absolute magnitude as the vertical
coordinate. Another cluster, whose distance is to
be determined, can then be plotted in the same
diagram using the apparent magnitudes as the
vertical coordinate. Now the vertical distance of
the main sequences tells how much the apparent
magnitudes differ from the absolute ones. Thus
the distance modulus m −M can be measured.
This method, known as the main sequence ﬁtting,
works for clusters whose stars are roughly at the
same distance; if the distances vary too much,
a clear main sequence cannot be distinguished.
Photometric Parallaxes
The determination of
the distance directly from (18.2) is called the
photometric method of distance determination
and the corresponding parallax, the photomet-
ric parallax. The most difﬁcult task when using
this method usually involves ﬁnding the absolute
magnitude; there are many ways of doing this.
For example, the two-dimensional MKK spec-
tral classiﬁcation allows one to determine the ab-
solute magnitude from the spectrum. The abso-
lute magnitudes of cepheids can be obtained from
their periods. A specially useful method for star
clusters is the procedure of main sequence ﬁtting.
A condition for the photometric method is that
the absolute magnitude scale ﬁrst be calibrated by
some other method.
Trigonometric parallaxes do not reach very
far. For example, even with the Hipparcos satel-
lite, only a few cepheid distances have been ac-
curately measured by this method. The method
of statistical parallaxes is indispensable for cal-
ibrating the absolute magnitudes of bright ob-
jects. When this has been done, the photometric

the initial luminosity function Ψ (MV) for main sequence
stars in the solar neighbourhood. The functions give the
number of stars per cubic parsec in the magnitude inter-
val [MV −1/2,MV + 1/2]; they are actually the prod-
ucts DΦ and DΨ , where D is the stellar density function
(in the solar neighbourhood)
method can be used to obtain distances of objects
even further away.
Other examples of indicators of brightness, lu-
minosity criteria, are characteristic spectral lines
or the periods of cepheids. Again, their use re-
quires that they ﬁrst be calibrated by means of
some other method. It is a characteristic fea-
ture of astronomical distance determinations that
the measurement of large distances is based on
knowledge of the distances to nearer objects.

Stellar Statistics
The Stellar Luminosity Function
By system-
atically observing all stars in the solar neighbour-
hood, one can ﬁnd the distribution of their abso-
lute magnitudes. This is given by the luminosity
function Φ(M) (Fig. 18.7), which gives the rela-
tive number of main sequence stars with absolute
magnitudes in the range [M −1/2,M +1/2]. No
stars appear to be forming at present in the re-
gion of space where the luminosity function has
been determined. The age of the Milky Way is
10–15 Ga, which means that all stars less massive
than 0.9M⊙, will still be on the main sequence.
On the other hand, more massive stars, formed
early in the history of the Milky Way, will have
completed their evolution and disappeared. Low-
mass stars have accumulated in the luminosity
function for many generations of star formation,

372
18
The Milky Way
whereas bright, high-mass stars are the result of
recent star formation.
By taking into account the different main se-
quence lifetimes of stars of different masses and
hence of different magnitudes, one can deter-
mine the initial luminosity function Ψ (M), which
gives the brightness distribution at the time of star
formation, the zero age main sequence luminos-
ity function. The relation between the function Ψ
and the observed luminosity function is
Ψ (M) = Φ(M)T0/tE(M),
(18.3)
where T0 is the age of the Milky Way and
tE(M) is the main sequence lifetime of stars of
magnitude M. Here we assume that the birth rate
of stars of magnitude M has remained constant
during the lifetime of the Milky Way. The initial
luminosity function is shown in Fig. 18.7.
The Fundamental Equation of Stellar Statis-
tics. The Stellar Density
A crucial problem for
studies of the structure of the Milky Way is to ﬁnd
out how the density of stars varies in space. The
number of stars per unit volume at a distance r in
the direction (l,b) from the Sun is given by the
stellar density D = D(r,l,b).
The stellar density cannot be directly observed
except in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Sun. However, it can be calculated if one knows
the luminosity function and the interstellar ex-
tinction as a function of distance in a given direc-
tion. In addition the number of stars per unit solid
angle (e.g. per square arc second) can be deter-
mined as a function of limiting apparent magni-
tude by means of star counts (Fig. 18.8).
Let us consider the stars within the solid an-
gle ω in the direction (l,b) and in the distance
range [r,r + dr] (Fig. 18.9). We let their lumi-
nosity function Φ(M) be the same as in the so-
lar neighbourhood and their unknown stellar den-
sity D. The absolute magnitude M of the stars of
apparent magnitude m is, as usual,
M = m −5lg(r/10 pc) −A(r).
The number of stars in the apparent magnitude
interval [m−0.5,m+0.5] in the volume element
Fig. 18.8 The stellar density is determined by means of
star counts. In practice, the counting is done on photo-
graphic plates. (Cartoon S. Harris)

The stars of apparent magnitude m in the given

ber N(m), one has to integrate dN(m) over all

Equation (18.5) is called the fundamental equa-
tion of stellar statistics. Its left-hand side, the
number of stars in the apparent magnitude inter-
val [m −0.5,m + 0.5] in the solid angle ω, is
obtained from the observations: one counts the
stars of different magnitudes in a chosen area of
a photographic plate. The luminosity function is
known from the solar neighbourhood. The extinc-
tion A(r) can be determined for the chosen areas,
for instance, by means of multicolour photome-
try. In order to solve the integral equation (18.5)
for D(r,l,b), several methods have been devel-
oped, but we shall not go into them here.
Figure 18.10(a) shows the stellar density in the
solar neighbourhood in the plane of the Milky
Way, and Fig. 18.10(b) in the direction perpen-
dicular to the plane. There are several individual
concentrations, but e.g. spiral structure cannot be
observed in such a limited region of space.
The Distribution of Bright Objects
Using
stellar statistical methods, one can only study
the close neighbourhood of the Sun, out to about
1 kpc at the most. Absolutely faint objects can-
not be observed very far. Since the solar neigh-
bourhood appears to be fairly representative of
the general properties of the Milky Way, its study
is naturally important, giving information e.g. on
the distributions and luminosity functions of stars
of various spectral types. However, in order to get
an idea of the larger-scale structure of the Milky
Way, one has to make use of objects that are as
absolutely bright as possible, and which can be
observed even at large distances.
Examples of suitable objects are stars of early
spectral types, H II regions, OB associations,
open star clusters, cepheids, RR Lyrae stars, su-
pergiants and giants of late spectral types, and
globular clusters. Some of these objects differ
greatly in age, such as the young OB associations,
on the one hand, and the old globular clusters, on
the other. Any differences in their space distribu-
tion tell us about changes in the general structure
of the Milky Way.
The young optical objects, the H II regions,
OB associations and open clusters, are strongly
concentrated in the plane of the Milky Way (Ta-
ble 18.1). Figure 18.11 shows that they also ap-
pear to be concentrated in three drawn-out bands,
at least within the observed region. Since these
types of objects in other galaxies are known to
be part of a spiral structure, the observed bands
in the Milky Way have been interpreted as por-
tions of three spiral arms passing through the so-
lar neighbourhood. Stars of later spectral types
seem to be much more evenly distributed. Apart

Old objects, particularly the globular clusters,
have an almost spherical distribution about the
centre of the Milky Way (Fig. 18.12). The space
density of old objects increases towards the galac-
tic centre. They can be used to determine the dis-
tance of the Sun from the galactic centre; the
value of this distance is about 8.5 kpc. More
recent measurements using other methods have
given a distance of 8 kpc (26,000 light years).
Stellar Populations
Studies of the motions of
the stars in the Milky Way have revealed that the
orbits of stars moving in the galactic plane are al-
most circular. These stars are also usually young,
a few hundred million years at the most. They
also contain a relatively large amount of heavy
elements, about 2–4 %. The interstellar mate-
rial similarly moves in the galactic plane in al-
most circular orbits. On the basis of their motions
and their chemical composition, the interstellar
medium and the youngest stars are collectively
referred to as population I.
Outside the plane of the Milky Way, an almost
spherically symmetric halo extends out to over
50 kpc and even further out there is a corona. The
stellar density is largest near the galactic centre
and decreases outwards. The halo contains very

little interstellar matter, and its stars are old, per-
haps up to 13 × 109 years. These stars are also
very metal-poor. Their orbits may be very ec-
centric and show no preference for the galactic
plane. On the basis of these criteria, one deﬁnes
stars of population II. Typical population II ob-
jects are the globular clusters, and the RR Lyrae
and W Virginis stars.
While the Sun and the closest stars move much
like the stars of population I, the stars of popula-
tion II have large velocities with respect to the lo-
cal standard of rest, up to more than 300 km s−1.
In reality their velocities at the solar distance
from the galactic centre are quite small and may
sometimes be opposite to the direction of mo-
tion of the LSR. The large relative velocities
only reﬂect the motion of the LSR with a veloc-
ity of about 220 km s−1 round the galactic cen-
tre.
Between these two extremes, there is a se-
quence of intermediate populations. In addition
to populations I and II, one generally also speaks
of a disk population, including the Sun, for in-
stance. The typical motions, chemical compo-
sition and age of the various populations (Ta-
ble 18.1) contain information about the evolu-
tion of our Galaxy and about the formation of its
stars.
18.3
The Rotation of the Milky Way
Differential Rotation. Oort’s Formulas
The
ﬂatness of the Milky Way is already suggestive
of a general rotation about an axis normal to the
galactic plane. Observations of the motions both
of stars and of interstellar gas have conﬁrmed
this rotation and shown it to be differential. This
means that the angular velocity of rotation de-
pends on the distance from the galactic centre
(Fig. 18.13). Thus the Milky Way does not ro-
tate like a rigid body. Near the Sun, the rotational
velocity decreases with radius.
The observable effects of the galactic rotation
were derived by the Dutch astronomer Jan H.
Oort. Let us suppose the stars are moving in cir-
cular orbits about the galactic centre (Fig. 18.14).
This approximation is acceptable for population I
stars and gas. The star S, seen from the Sun ⊙
at galactic longitude l at distance r, has circular
velocity V at a distance R from the centre. Sim-
ilarly for the Sun the galactic radius and velocity
are R0 and V0. The relative radial velocity vr of
the star with respect to the Sun is the difference
between the projections of the circular velocities
on the line of sight:
vr = V cosα −V0 sinl,
(18.6)

components of the velocities
Fig. 18.14 In order to derive Oort’s formulas, the veloc-
ity vectors of the Sun and the star S are divided into com-
ponents along the line ⊙S and normal to it
where α is the angle between the velocity vector
of the star and the line of sight. From Fig. 18.14
the angle CS⊙= α + 90◦. By applying the sine
theorem to the triangle CS⊙one obtains
sin(α + 90◦)

or

(18.7)
Denoting the angular velocity of the star by
ω = V/R and that of the Sun by ω0 = V0/R0,
one obtains the observable radial velocity in the
form
vr = R0(ω −ω0)sinl.
(18.8)
The tangential component of the relative ve-
locity of the Sun and the star is obtained as fol-
lows. From Fig. 18.14,
vt = V sinα −V0 cosl = Rω sinα −R0ω0 cosl.
The triangle ⊙CP gives
R sinα = R0 cosl −r,
and hence
vt = R0(ω −ω0)cosl −ωr.
(18.9)

18.3
The Rotation of the Milky Way
377
Oort noted that in the close neighbourhood of
the Sun (r ≪R0), the difference of the angular
velocities will be very small. Therefore a good
approximation for the exact equations (18.8) and
(18.9) is obtained by keeping only the ﬁrst term of
the Taylor series of ω −ω0 in the neighbourhood
of R = R0:
ω −ω0 =
 dω

tial rotation according to Oort’s formulas as functions
of galactic longitude. (a) Radial velocities for objects at
a distance of 1 and 2 kpc. (Compare with Fig. 18.13.)
Strictly, the longitude at which the radial velocity vanishes
depends on the distance. Oort’s formulas are valid only in
the close vicinity of the Sun. (b) Proper motions
Equation (18.10) says that the observed radial
velocities of stars at the same distance should
be a double sine curve as a function of galactic
longitude. This has been conﬁrmed by observa-
tions (Fig. 18.15(a)). If the distance to the stars
involved is known, the amplitude of the curve de-
termines the value of the Oort constant A.
Independently of distance, the proper motions
of the stars form a double sine wave as a function
of galactic longitude, as seen in Fig. 18.15(b).
The amplitude of the curve is A and its mean
value, B.
In 1927 on the basis of this kind of analy-
sis, Oort established that the observed motions
of the stars indicated a differential rotation of
the Milky Way. Taking into account an extensive
set of observational data, the International As-
tronomical Union IAU has conﬁrmed the present
recommended values for the Oort constants:
A = 15 kms−1 kpc−1,
B = −10 kms−1 kpc−1.
The Oort constants obey some interesting re-
lations. By subtracting (18.13) from (18.11), one

A + B = −

(18.16)
Knowing the values of A and B, one can cal-
culate the angular velocity ω0 = 0.0053′′/year,
which is the angular velocity of the local standard
of rest around the galactic centre.
The circular velocity of the Sun and the LSR
can be measured in an independent way by us-
ing extragalactic objects as a reference. In this
way a value of about 220 km s−1 has been ob-
tained for V0. Using (18.15) one can now calcu-
late the distance of the galactic centre R0. The
result is about 8.5 kpc, in good agreement with
the distance to the centre of the globular clus-
ter system. The direction to the galactic centre
obtained from the distribution of radial veloci-
ties and proper motions by means of (18.10) and
(18.14) also agrees with other measurements.
The orbital period of the Sun in the Galaxy ac-
cording to these results is about 2.5 × 108 years.
Since the Sun’s age is nearly 5 × 109 years, it
has made about 20 revolutions around the galac-
tic centre. At the end of the previous revolution,
the Carboniferous period had ended on Earth and
the ﬁrst mammals would soon appear.
The Distribution of Interstellar Matter
Ra-
dio emission from interstellar gas, in particular
that of neutral hydrogen, is not strongly absorbed
or scattered by interstellar dust. It can therefore
be used to map the structure of the Milky Way on
large scales. Radio signals can be detected even
from the opposite edge of the Milky Way.
The position of a radio source, for example an
H I cloud, in the Galaxy cannot be directly deter-
mined. However, an indirect method exists, based
on the differential rotation of the Galaxy.
Figure 18.16 is a schematic view of a situation
in which gas clouds on the circles P1,P2,... are
observed in the direction l (−90◦< l < 90◦). The
angular velocity increases inwards, and therefore
the greatest angular velocity along the line of
Fig. 18.16 Clouds P1, P2, ... seen in the same direction
at various distances
sight is obtained at the point Pk, where the line
of sight is tangent to a circle. This means that the
radial velocity of the clouds in a ﬁxed direction
grows with distance up to the maximum velocity
at cloud Pk:
vr,max = Rk(ω −ω0),
(18.17)
where Rk = R0 sinl. The distance of cloud Pk
from the Sun is r = R0 cosl. When r increases
further, vr decreases monotonically. Figure 18.17
shows how the observed radial velocity in a given
direction varies with distance r, if the gas moves
in circular orbits and the angular velocity de-
creases outwards.
The neutral hydrogen 21 cm line has been par-
ticularly important for mapping the Milky Way.
Figure 18.18 gives a schematic view of how the
hydrogen spectral line is made up of the radia-
tion of many individual concentrations of neutral
hydrogen, clouds or spiral arms. The line com-
ponent produced by each cloud has a wavelength
which depends on the radial velocity of the cloud
and a strength depending on its mass and density.
The total emission is the sum of these contribu-
tions.
By making observations at various galactic
longitudes and assuming that the clouds form at
least partly continuous spiral arms, the distribu-

18.3
The Rotation of the Milky Way

Fig. 18.17 The radial velocity as a function of distance
(shown schematically)
tion of neutral hydrogen in the galactic plane
can be mapped. Figure 16.17 shows a map of
the Milky Way obtained from 21 cm line obser-
vations of neutral hydrogen. It appears that the
neutral hydrogen is concentrated in spiral arms.
However, interpretation of the details is difﬁcult
because of the uncertainties of the map. In order
to obtain the distances to the gas clouds, one has
to know the rotation curve, the circular velocity
as a function of the galactic radius. This is deter-
mined from the same radial velocity observations
and involves assumptions concerning the density
and rotation of the gas. The interpretation of the
spiral structure obtained from radio observations
is also still uncertain. For example, it is difﬁcult
to ﬁt the radio spiral structure to the one obtained
near the Sun from optical observations of young
stars and associations.
The Rotation, Mass Distribution and Total
Mass of the Milky Way
In (18.17) the galac-
tic longitude l gives the galactic radius Rk of the
clouds with maximum radial velocity. By mak-
ing observations at different longitudes, one can
therefore use (18.17) to determine the angular ve-
locity of the gas for various distances from the
galactic centre. (Circular motions must be as-
sumed.) In this way, the rotation curve ω = ω(R)
Fig. 18.18 Clouds at different distances have different
velocities and therefore give rise to emission lines with
different Doppler shifts. The observed ﬂux density proﬁle
(continuous curve) is the sum of the line proﬁles of all
the individual line proﬁles (dashed curves). The numbers
of the line proﬁles correspond to the clouds in the upper
picture
and the corresponding velocity curve V = V (R)
(= ωR) are obtained.
Figure 18.19 shows the rotation curve of the
Milky Way. Its central part rotates like a rigid
body, i.e. the angular velocity is independent of
the radius. Outside this region, the velocity ﬁrst
drops and then begins to rise gradually. A maxi-
mum velocity is reached at about 8 kpc from the
centre. Near the Sun, a little further from the cen-
tre, the rotational velocity is about 220 km s−1.
According to earlier opinions, the velocity con-
tinues to decrease outwards. This would mean
that most of the mass is inside the solar radius.
This mass could then be determined from Ke-
pler’s third law. According to (6.34),
M = R0V 2
0 /G.
Using the values R0 = 8.5 kpc and V0 =
220 kms−1, one obtains
M = 1.9 × 1041 kg = 1.0 × 1011 M⊙.

This gives an escape velocity near the Sun Ve =

stars moving in the direction of galactic rotation,
l = 90◦, with velocities larger than 90 km s−1
with respect to the local standard of rest, since the
velocity of such stars would exceed the escape ve-
locity. This has been conﬁrmed by observations.
The preceding considerations have been based
on the assumption that near the Sun, the whole
mass of the Galaxy can be taken to be concen-
trated in a central point. If this were true, the
rotation curve should be of the Keplerian form,
V ∝R−1/2. That this is not the case can be estab-
lished from the values of the Oort constants.

Using the properties (18.15) and (18.16) of the
Oort constants, one ﬁnds
(A −B)/(A + B) = 2
(18.19)
for a Keplerian rotation curve. This disagrees
with the observed value and thus the assumed Ke-
plerian law does not apply.
The mass distribution in the Milky Way can
be studied on the basis of the rotation curve. One
looks for a suitable mass distribution, such that
the correct rotation curve is reproduced. Recently
distant globular clusters have been discovered,
showing that the Milky Way is larger than ex-
pected. Also, observations of the rotation curve
outside the solar circle suggest that the rotational
velocity might begin to rise again. These results
suggest that the mass of the Galaxy might be as
much as ten times larger than had been thought.
18.4
Structural Components of the
Milky Way
We have seen how the structure of the Milky Way
can be globally described by means of an almost
spherical halo of old stars and a disk of gas and
young and middle-aged stars. Due to its structure
the Milky Way belongs to disk galaxies, which
are discussed in the next chapter. In a more de-
tailed picture more small-scale features can also
be distinguished.
The Thick Disk
In the traditional scheme di-
viding the stars of the Milky Way into a se-
ries of populations it was left undecided whether

the populations should be considered as qualita-
tively different classes or merely steps along a
continuous sequence. As the quality and quan-
tity of observations have improved, it has become
clear that what was deﬁned as the intermediate
population II really represents a separate compo-
nent of the Milky Way with a pattern of element
abundances stellar motions that separate it clearly
from the old (thin) disk. This population is now
referred to as the thick galactic disk. A thick disk
has also been detected in some other galaxies, but
it does not appear to be a universal feature of all
disk galaxies.
The Galactic Bar
As will be seen in the next
chapter, Sect. 19.1, a large fraction of all disk
galaxies are barred, with an elongated light distri-
bution at the centre. The ﬁrst indication that this
might also be the case for the Milky Way was
found in velocity measurements of neutral hydro-
gen, which were incompatible with gas moving
along circular orbits. In 1971 W.W. Shane showed
that the motions of the gas could be explained,
if there is a central bar pointing about 20◦away
from the direction of the Galactic centre.
It is more difﬁcult to detect a bar in observa-
tions of the stars. This was ﬁrst done using the
COBE satellite, which (apart from mapping the
cosmic microwave background, see Sect. 19.7)
also made a map of the sky at the infrared wave-
lengths dominated by the light of old stars. Be-
cause of perspective, the nearer end of the bar at
positive galactic longitude will look slightly dif-
ferent than the farther end. Such an asymmetry
was present in the infrared map, consistent with
a bar with an axial ratio of 0.6.
Later conﬁrmation of the existence of the bar
has come from mapping of the central distribu-
tion of old stars using near-infrared photometric
distances, see Fig. 18.20.
Spiral Structure
As mentioned earlier, the
Milky Way appears to be a spiral galaxy
(Fig. 18.21), but there is no general agreement on
the detailed form of the spiral pattern. For exam-
ple, in 1976 Y.M. Georgelin and Y.P. Georgelin
determined the distances of H II regions by ra-
dio and optical observations. In the optical region

Galactic pole. Solid symbols indicate the mean positions
of red clump giants in given directions, and the thick
grey lines represent the range of their distances. The line
through the mean distances illustrates a bar of 3 kpc length
inclined 22.5◦to the direction to the Galactic centre.
The contour map shows a model of the bar derived from
infrared observations. (C. Babusiaux, G. Gilmore 2005,
MNRAS 358, 1309, Fig. 6)
Fig. 18.21 General view of the spiral pattern of the Milky
Way. Different tracers of spiral arms lead to somewhat dif-
ferent patterns, but they tend to agree that a four-armed
pattern like the one indicated here gives the best over-
all representation. The names of the arms are those most
commonly used. See also Fig. 18.11. (Y. Xu et al. 2006,
Science 311, 54)

their method is independent of assumptions about
the galactic rotation law. They then ﬁtted four spi-
ral arms through the H II regions.
Later investigations using a variety of meth-
ods, both optical and radio have conﬁrmed that
a four-armed pattern gives the best descrip-
tion of the spiral structure in the Sun’s vicinity
(Fig. 18.22). The pitch angle of the spiral in this
model is about 11.3◦. Three of the arms start at
the position of the galactic bar.
The cause of the spiral structure is a long-
standing problem. A small perturbation in the
disk will quickly be stretched into a spiral shape
by differential rotation. However, such a spiral
would disappear in a few galactic revolutions,
a few hundred million years.
An important step forward in the study of the
spiral structure was the density wave theory de-
veloped by Chia-Chiao Lin and Frank H. Shu
in the 1960’s. The spiral structure is taken to be
a wavelike variation of the density of the disk.
The spiral pattern rotates as a solid body with an
angular velocity smaller than that of the galactic
rotation, while the stars and gas in the disk pass
through the wave.
The density wave theory explains in a natural
way why young objects, like molecular clouds,
H II regions and bright young stars are found in
the spiral arms. As gas passes through the wave,
it is strongly compressed. The internal gravity of
the gas clouds then becomes more important and
causes them to collapse and form stars.
It takes about 107 years for the material to pass
through a spiral arm. By that time, the hot, bright
stars have ﬁnished their evolution, their ultravio-
let radiation has ceased and the H II regions have
disappeared. The less massive stars formed in the
spiral arms are spread out in the disk by their pe-
culiar velocities.
It is not yet clear what gives rise to the spiral
wave. For some further discussion of spiral struc-
ture, see Sect. 19.4.
The Galactic Centre
Our knowledge of the
centre of the Milky Way is mostly based on radio
and infrared observations (Fig. 18.22). In the op-
tical region the view towards the centre is blocked
already by the dark clouds in the Sagittarius spiral
arm about 2 kpc from us. The galactic centre is in-
teresting because it may be a small-scale version

18.5
The Formation and Evolution of the Milky Way

of the much more violently active nuclei of some
external galaxies (see Sect. 19.7). It therefore pro-
vides opportunities to study at close hand phe-
nomena related to active galaxies. At the galac-
tic centre there us supermassive black hole with a
mass of nearly 5 × 106 M⊙
As one approaches the galactic centre the stel-
lar density continues to rise towards a sharp cen-
tral peak. In contrast, the galactic gas disk has
a central hole of radius about 3 kpc. This may
be due to the galactic bar, which will channel gas
into the galactic nucleus leaving a gas-free zone
at larger radii.
Inside the central hole there is a dense gas
disk. Its radius is about 1.5 kpc in neutral hy-
drogen, but most of its mass is molecular and
concentrated within 300 pc of the nucleus. In
this region the mass of molecular gas is about
108 M⊙, or 5 % of the total molecular mass of
the Milky Way. The molecular clouds are prob-
ably conﬁned by the pressure from surrounding
very hot (T ≈108 K) gas. This hot gas may then
expand vertically, forming a galactic wind. Gas
lost to a wind or to star formation is replenished
with infalling gas from larger radii.
The central 10 pc are dominated by the ra-
dio continuum source Sgr A and a dense star
cluster observed in the infrared. There is also
molecular gas with complex motions and signs
of star formation activity. Within Sgr A there
is a unique point-like radio continuum source
known as Sgr A∗. The position of Sgr A∗agrees
to within 1′′ with the centre of a cluster of stars
that is much denser than anything observed in the
galactic disk.
The stellar density of the central star cluster
can be as high as 3 × 1014 stars per cubic parsec,
while around the Sun it is just one star per cubic
parsec. The stars of the cluster orbit the central
black hole. Motions of the innermost stars have
been followed since the end of the 1990’s. A cou-
ple of stars have already managed to make a full
revolution around the centre (Fig. 18.23), the pe-
riods being 16 and 11.5 years. When the period is
known and the size of the orbit is seen the mass of
the central body can be calculated. The researches
working with the Keck telescope got in 2014 a
value of 4.6 ± 0.7 × 106 solar masses.

Way during over 15 years. The background image was

According to VLBI measurements the diam-
eter of the accretion disk surrounding the black
hole is less than 10 au. Eruptions observed at
infrared wavelengths, lasting only about twenty
minutes, point to the same size. It can be calcu-
lated that the diameter of the black hole is about
0.2 au.
18.5
The Formation and Evolution
of the Milky Way
Like all galaxies the Milky Way is supposed to
have formed through the collapse of a region of
higher than average density in the Universe. The
general view of how this happened will be pre-
sented in the next two chapters,in particular in
Sects. 19.8 and 20.7. Some traces of the forma-
tion process will be preserved in the properties of
local stars of different ages. These represent in-
formation about the formation of the Milky Way
that is not available for other galaxies.
The Ages of Stars
The most direct way of
studying the evolution of the Milky Way is by
means of the observed ages of stars. The tra-
ditional sequence of populations described in
Sect. 18.2 is also a sequence corresponding to

stars, in order of increasing
age. (K. Freeman,

stars of different ages. The oldest component, the
stellar halo forms an almost spherical distribu-
tion of stars with ages 12–14 Ga, representing the
oldest part of the Milky Way.
In contrast, the old and young population I
consists of stars with ages less than 10 Ga, which
were initially formed in a very thin layer that has
been thickened by encounters with spiral arms
and molecular cloud complexes.
Intermediate between these two, as we have
noted, is the thick disk with an age about 10–
12 Ga. Another intermediate population in the
Milky Way is the central bulge including the
galactic bar, and containing stars of ages 7–11 Ga.
Chemical Enrichment
The history of the for-
mation of the Milky Way is preserved in the prop-
erties of its older stars, above all in their “chemi-
cal” composition, i.e. the abundances of elements
and isotopes heavier than helium. (All these heav-
ier elements are often referred to as “metals” in
the astrophysical jargon.)
Only hydrogen and helium were present as the
ﬁrst stars formed. As successive generations of
stars evolved, nuclear reactions produced heavy
elements, some of which were returned to the in-
terstellar gas in supernova explosions or stellar
winds. These heavy elements were then incorpo-
rated into the following generation of stars, grad-
ually increasing the metal abundance in the inter-
stellar medium.
Some of the stars formed were of low mass,
and had life-times long enough that they are still
present. Their chemical composition will reﬂect
the abundances in the interstellar medium at the
time they were formed. Studying the chemical
abundances of stars of different ages therefore
gives information on the star formation history of
the Milky Way, both on the rate at which stars
have formed at a given epoch and on the masses
and other characteristics of those stars when they
formed.
One commonly used indicator of the metal
abundance in stars is the mass of iron relative
to hydrogen, in logarithmic units and measured
relative to the solar values, [Fe/H]. Figure 18.24
shows the value of [FE/H] for different types of
objects of various ages. The general picture is
that the metal abundance rose rapidly during the
ﬁrst billion years and has afterwards grown only
slowly. The lowest values of [Fe/H] discovered in
old halo stars are about −5.
Many models have been developed describ-
ing the chemical evolution of the Milky Way
and other galaxies, incorporating prescriptions
for star formation, and infall of gas from the
outside. In particular the rapid early rise of the
metal abundance is difﬁcult to explain in the sim-

18.6
Examples
385
plest models. This difﬁculty, the scarcity of old
metal-poor disk stars, has become known as the
“G dwarf problem”, since the oldest stars still
on the main series are of spectral class G. The
most direct way that the G dwarf problem can be
avoided is to suppose that a large portion of the
interstellar gas was accreted after the formation
of the oldest stars.
Formation of the Milky Way
Galaxies are
thought to have formed when gas clouds of higher
than average density in the Universe collapsed
under their own gravity. As the gas is compressed
stars are born in it. After the end of the collapse
the cloud settles into a quasi-stationary state.
Evolution continues at a slower pace. Evolving
stars return chemically enriched gas to interstel-
lar space, where it is mixed with remaining, un-
processed gas and star formation continues.
There are two competing pictures of how
galaxy formation proceeds. In the monolithic col-
lapse model it is assumed that large galaxies form
coherently in the collapse of a massive cloud con-
taining the bulk of the material constituting the
galaxy. In the hierarchical picture most of the
stars form in much smaller clouds, which later ag-
glomerate together to form the galaxies we now
observe. The evidence for these pictures in other
galaxies will be considered in the next chapter.
The case of the Milky Way already shows that
the contrast of the monolithic and the hierarchical
picture is oversimpliﬁed. Some aspects of galac-
tic structure ﬁt more naturally into a monolithic
theory. For example, the rapid collapse of the
halo, followed by a more gradual build-up of the
disk ﬁts with this picture. The pattern of chemical
abundances are also homogeneous in a way that is
more compatible with a pattern of star formation
that was uniform throughout galactic history.
Other observations are indicative of a hier-
archical formation history. For example, stellar
abundance patterns in the thick disk differ from
those in the old thin disk. The most natural way of
explaining this is that the thick disk formed by the
accretion of one or more small satellite galaxies
with different histories of star formation. Another
sign of the importance of the infall of satellite
galaxies is the existence of systems such as the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which appears to be in
the course of being disrupted by the Milky Way.
There is about ﬁve times as much dark matter
as visible matter. Recent simulations have con-
ﬁrmed that this dark matter has an essential role
in the formation of galaxies. During the ﬁrst bil-
lion years of the universe the dark matter formed
gravitational condensates to which the visible
matter was concentrated to form initial galax-
ies. Formation of the current galaxies has been
a complicated process that involved effects of the
dark matter, interactions, collisions and mergers
of galaxies.
18.6
Examples
Example 18.1 Show that if the stars are uni-
formly distributed in space and there is no in-
terstellar extinction, the number of stars brighter
than apparent magnitude m is
N0(m) = N0(0) × 100.6m.
Let us suppose ﬁrst that all stars have the same
absolute magnitude M. The distance in parsecs of
those stars having the apparent magnitude m is
r = 10 × 100.2(m−M).
In order to appear brighter than m, a star has to
be within a sphere of radius r. Because the stellar
density is constant, the number of such stars is
proportional to the volume:
N0(m) ∝r3 ∝100.6m.
The result does not depend on the absolute
magnitudes of the stars, so that the same result
still applies when the magnitudes are not equal,
as long as the luminosity function does not de-
pend on distance. Thus the equation is generally
valid under the stated conditions.
Example 18.2 (The Estimation of Distances by
Means of Oort’s Formulas) An object in the
galactic plane at longitude l = 45◦has the radial
velocity of 30 km s−1 with respect to the LSR.
What is its distance?

According to (18.10),
vr = Ar sin2l.
Thus
r =

Asin2l =
30 kms−1
15 kms−1 kpc−1 = 2 kpc.
In practice, the peculiar velocities are so large that
this method cannot be used for distance determi-
nation. Oort’s formulas are mostly suitable only
for statistical studies.
Example 18.3 (Discussion of the Gravitational
Field of a Uniform Disk) It can be shown that the
gravitational ﬁeld of a homogeneous inﬁnite thin
disk is constant and directed towards the plane of
the disk. If the mass per unit area of the disk is σ,
the gravitational ﬁeld is
g = 2πGσ.
A test particle located outside the plane will
therefore get a constant acceleration towards
the plane. Taking a numerical example, assume
a mass of 1011 M⊙distributed uniformly on a cir-
cular disk 20 kpc in diameter. The mass per unit
area will be a
σ =
1011 × 2 × 1030 kg
π(104 × 3.086 × 1016 m)2
= 0.67 kgm−2.
The corresponding gravitational ﬁeld is
g = 2.8 × 10−10 ms−2.
Let a star be located at d = 1 kpc above the plane,
initially at rest (not very near the edge of the disk,
in order to keep our approximation valid). The
disk will pull it towards the plane, and when the
star crosses the plane, it has acquired a velocity
given by
v =

2gd = 130 kms−1.
The time required to reach the plane is
t = v/g = 15 × 106 a.

19
Galaxies
The galaxies are the fundamental building blocks
of the Universe. Some of them are very simple in
structure, containing only normal stars and show-
ing no particular individual features. There are
also galaxies that are almost entirely made of neu-
tral gas. On the other hand, others are complex
systems, built up from many separate interact-
ing components—stars, neutral and ionised gas,
dust, molecular clouds, magnetic ﬁelds, cosmic
rays.... The galaxies may form small groups or
large clusters in space. At the centre of many
galaxies, there is a compact nucleus that may
sometimes be so bright that it overwhelms all the
normal radiation of the galaxy.
The luminosity of the brightest normal galax-
ies may correspond to 1012 solar luminosities,
but most of them are much fainter—the smallest
ones that have been discovered are about 105 L⊙.
Since galaxies do not have a sharp outer edge,
to some extent their masses and radii depend on
how these quantities are deﬁned. If only the bright
central parts are included, a giant galaxy may typ-
ically have a mass of about 1013 M⊙, and a radius
of 30 kpc, and a dwarf, correspondingly, 107 M⊙,
and 0.5 kpc.
When the existence of dark matter was con-
ﬁrmed the whole ﬁeld of galactic research was
changed. It was only the dark matter that helped
to give a consistent model for the origin and evo-
lution of galaxies.
The fraction of dark matter of the total mass of
galaxies varies considerably. In big galaxies there
is about ﬁve times as much dark matter as ordi-
nary visible matter. In the smallest galaxies the
ratio of the dark matter to the visible matter can
be hundreds or even thousands.
When smaller and smaller galaxies have been
found the boundary between star clusters and
galaxies has become obscure. The smallest galax-
ies are similar to dense star clusters. Therefore
some researches have redeﬁned galaxies: a star
system is a galaxy if in addition to stars it con-
tains also dark matter.
19.1
The Classiﬁcation of Galaxies
A useful ﬁrst step towards an understanding of
galaxies is a classiﬁcation based on their various
forms. Although such a morphological classiﬁca-
tion must always be to some extent subjective, it
provides a framework within which the quanti-
tative properties of galaxies can be discussed in
a systematic fashion. However, it should always
be remembered that the picture thus obtained will
be limited to those galaxies that are large and
bright enough to be easily visible in the sky. An
idea of the consequent limitations can be obtained
from Fig. 19.1, showing the radii and magnitudes
of normal galaxies. One sees that only within
a narrow region of this diagram can galaxies be
easily found. If a galaxy has too large a radius for
its magnitude (small surface brightness), it will
disappear in the background light from the night
sky. On the other hand, if its radius is too small,
it looks like a star and is not noticed on a photo-
graphic plate. In the following, we shall mainly
be concerned with bright galaxies that ﬁt within
these limits.

If a classiﬁcation is to be useful, it should
at least roughly correspond to important phys-
Fig. 19.1 Magnitudes and diameters of observable extra-
galactic objects. Objects to the upper left look like stars.
The quasars in this region have been discovered on the ba-
sis of their spectra. Objects to the lower right have a sur-
face brightness much smaller than that of the night sky.
In recent years large numbers of low surface brightness
galaxies have been discovered in this region. (Arp, H.
(1965): Astrophys. J. 142, 402)
ical properties of the galaxies. Most classiﬁca-
tions accord in their main features with the one
put forward by Edwin Hubble in 1926. Hubble’s
own version of the Hubble sequence is shown
in Fig. 19.2. The various types of galaxies are
ordered in a sequence from early to late types.
There are three main types: elliptical, lenticu-
lar, and spiral galaxies. The spirals are divided
into two sequences, normal and barred spirals.
In addition, Hubble included a class of irregular
galaxies. In lenticular and spiral galaxies the mat-
ter is concentrated in a ﬂat disk and thus they can
be called collectively as disk galaxies.
The elliptical galaxies (Fig. 19.6) appear in the
sky as elliptical concentrations of stars, in which
the density falls off in a regular fashion as one
goes outwards. Usually there are no signs of in-
terstellar matter (dark bands of dust, bright young
stars). The ellipticals differ from each other only
in shape and on this basis they are classiﬁed as
E0, E1, ..., E7. If the major and minor axes of an
elliptical galaxy are a and b, its type is deﬁned to
be En, where
n = 10

(19.1)
An E0 galaxy thus looks circular in the sky. The
apparent shape of an E galaxy depends on the
direction from which it is seen. In reality an
E0 galaxy may therefore be truly spherical or
it may be a circular disk viewed directly from
above.

sion. At this stage the existence of type S0 was still

The Classiﬁcation of Galaxies

Fig. 19.3 The classiﬁcation of normal spiral and S0 galaxies. (Mt. Wilson Observatory)
A later addition to the Hubble sequence is
a class of giant elliptical galaxies denoted cD.
These are generally found in the middle of clus-
ters of galaxies. They consist of a central part
looking like a normal elliptical surrounded by an
extended fainter halo of stars.
In the Hubble sequence the lenticulars or
S0 galaxies are placed between the elliptical and
the spiral types. Like the ellipticals they contain
only little interstellar matter and show no signs
of spiral structure. However, in addition to the
usual elliptical stellar component, they also con-
tain a ﬂat disk made up of stars. In this respect
they are like spiral galaxies (Figs. 19.3, 19.4).
The characteristic feature of spiral galaxies is
a more or less well-deﬁned spiral pattern in the

disk. Spiral galaxies consist of a central bulge,
which is structurally similar to an E galaxy, and
of a stellar disk, like in an S0 galaxy. In addi-
tion to these, there is a thin disk of gas and other
interstellar matter, where young stars are being
born, forming the spiral pattern. There are two se-
quences of spirals, normal Sa–Sb–Sc, and barred
SBa–SBb–SBc spirals. In the barred spirals the
spiral pattern ends at a central bar, whereas in
the normal spirals the spiral pattern may end at
an inner ring or continue all the way to the cen-
tre. The position of a galaxy within the spiral se-
quence is determined on the basis of three criteria
(which are not always in agreement): later types

have a smaller central bulge, more narrow spiral
arms and a more open spiral pattern. The Milky
Way Galaxy is thought to be of type SABbc (in-
termediate between Sb and Sc, and between nor-
mal and barred spirals).
The classical Hubble sequence is essentially
based on bright galaxies; faint galaxies have been
less easy to ﬁt into it (Fig. 19.5). For example,
the irregular galaxies of the original Hubble se-
quence can be divided into the classes Irr I and
Irr II. The Irr I galaxies form a continuation of
the Hubble sequence towards later types beyond
the Sc galaxies. They are rich in gas and contain
many young stars. Type Irr II are somewhat irreg-
ular small ellipticals containing only few young
stars but a lot of interstellar dust.
The smallest irregular galaxies are classiﬁed
as dIrr (dwarf irregulars). Another large group
of dwarf galaxies are the spherical or elliptic
dwarf galaxies dSph (dwarf spheroidals) and dE

(dwarf ellipsoids). They are much smaller than
ordinary elliptic galaxies or the stellar density is
much lower. Recently new kinds of even smaller
galaxies have been found. The include ultrafaint
dwarfs (uFd), blue compact dwarfs (BCD) and
ultracompact dwarfs (UCD) (Fig. 19.7).
In addition to the precise morphological clas-
siﬁcation a simpler classiﬁcation based on colours
was introduced at the beginning of the 2000’s.
The idea to classify fast the millions of new
galaxies found by modern digital survey pro-
grams as well as the very faint galaxies whose
shape is difﬁcult to distinguish. When galaxies
are plotted like stars in a colour–magnitude dia-
gram they are seen to form two distinct regions:
red galaxies (red sequence) and blue galaxies
(blue sequence) (Fig. 19.8). The red galaxies are
mainly ellipticals with old stars and blue galaxies
mainly spirals with younger stars.
19.2
Luminosities and Masses
Distances
In order to determine the absolute lu-
minosities and linear dimensions of galaxies one
needs to know their distances. Distances are also
needed in order to estimate the masses of galax-
ies, because these estimates depend on the abso-
lute linear size. Distances within the Local Group

side the Milky Way, most importantly by means
of variable stars. On the very large scale (be-
yond 50 Mpc), the distances can be deduced on
the basis of the expansion of the Universe (see

Fig. 19.8 A colour–magnitude graph contains 144,000
galaxies from the Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS). Bright-
ness increases from left to right. Galaxies are clearly di-
vided into two regions, red and blue. (Blanton et al., 2003,
ApJ 592, 819)
Sect. 20.1). In order to connect these two re-
gions one needs methods of distance determina-
tion based on the properties of individual galax-
ies.
To some extent local distances can be deter-
mined using structural components of galaxies,
such as the sizes of H II regions or the mag-
nitudes of globular clusters. However, to mea-
sure distances of tens of megaparsecs, one needs
a distance-independent method to determine the
absolute luminosities of entire galaxies. Several
such methods have been proposed. For example,
a luminosity classiﬁcation has been introduced
for late spiral types by Sidney van den Bergh. This
is based on a correlation between the luminosity
of a galaxy and the prominence of its spiral pat-
tern. Nowadays this method is not considered ac-
curate enough.
Other distance indicators are obtained if there
is some intrinsic property of the galaxy, which is
correlated with its total luminosity, and which can
be measured independently of the distance. Such
properties are the colour, the surface brightness
and the internal velocities in galaxies. All of these
have been used to measure distances to both spi-
ral and elliptical galaxies.
For example, the absolute luminosity of a gala-
xy should depend on its mass. The mass, in turn,
will be reﬂected in the velocities of stars and gas
in the galaxy. Accordingly there is a relationship
between the absolute luminosity and the velocity
dispersion (in ellipticals) and the rotational ve-
locity (in spirals). Since rotational velocities can
be measured very accurately from the width of
the hydrogen 21-cm line, the latter relationship
(known as the Tully–Fisher relation) is perhaps
the best distance indicator currently available.
The luminosity of the brightest galaxies in
clusters has been found to be reasonably constant.
This fact can be used to measure even larger dis-
tances, providing a method which is important in
cosmology.
Luminosities
The deﬁnition of the total lumi-
nosity of a galaxy is to some extent arbitrary,
since galaxies do not have a sharp outer edge. The
usual convention is to measure the luminosity of
a galaxy out to a given value of the surface bright-
ness, e.g. to 26.5 mag/sq.arcsec. For a given Hub-
ble type, the total luminosity L may vary widely.
As in the case of stars, the distribution of
galaxy luminosities is described by the luminos-
ity function Φ(L) (Fig. 19.9). This is deﬁned so
that the space density of galaxies with luminosi-
ties between L and L + dL is Φ(L)dL. It can
be determined from the observed magnitudes of
galaxies, once their distances have been estimated
in some way. In practice, one assumes some suit-
able functional form for Φ(L), which is then ﬁt-
ted to the observations. One common form is
Schechter’s luminosity function,
Φ(L)dL = Φ∗
 L
L∗
α
e−L/L∗d
 L
L∗

. (19.2)
The values of the parameters Φ∗, L∗, α are obser-
vationally determined for different types of ob-
jects; in general, they will be functions of posi-
tion.
The shape of the luminosity function is de-
scribed by the parameters α and L∗. The relative
number of faint galaxies is described by α. Since
its observed value is about −1.1, the density of
galaxies grows monotonically as one goes to-
wards fainter luminosities. The luminosity func-
tion falls off steeply above the luminosity L∗,

clusters of galaxies. The open symbols have been ob-
tained by omitting the cD galaxies. The distribution is then
well described by (19.2). The cD galaxies (ﬁlled symbols)
cause a deviation at the bright end. (Schechter, P. (1976):
Astrophys. J. 203, 297)
which therefore represents a characteristic lu-
minosity of bright galaxies. The observed L∗
corresponds to an absolute magnitude M∗=
−21.0 mag. The corresponding magnitude for the
Milky Way Galaxy is probably −20.2 mag. The
cD giant galaxies do not obey this brightness dis-
tribution; their magnitudes may be −24 mag and
even brighter.
The parameter Φ∗is proportional to the space
density of galaxies and is therefore a strong func-
tion of position. Since the total number density
of galaxies predicted by relation (19.2) is inﬁ-
nite, we deﬁne n∗= density of galaxies with
luminosity > L∗. The observed average value
of n∗over a large volume of space is n∗=
3.5×10−3 Mpc−3. The mean separation between
galaxies corresponding to this density is 4 Mpc.
Since most galaxies are fainter than L∗, and
since, in addition, they often belong to groups,
we see that the distances between normal galax-
ies are generally not much larger than their diam-
eters.
Masses
The distribution of mass in galaxies is
a crucial quantity, both for cosmology and for
theories of the origin and evolution of galax-
ies. Observationally it is determined from the
velocities of the stars and interstellar gas. To-
tal masses of galaxies can also be derived from
their motions in clusters of galaxies. The results
are usually given in terms of the corresponding
mass-luminosity ratio M/L, using the solar mass
and luminosity as units. The value measured in
the solar neighbourhood of the Milky Way is
M/L = 3. If M/L were constant, the mass distri-
bution could be determined from the observed lu-
minosity distribution by multiplying with M/L.
Unfortunately, there is no universally valid value
for the ratio M/L.
The masses of elliptical galaxies may be ob-
tained from the stellar velocity dispersion given
by the broadening of spectral lines. The method
is based on the virial theorem (see Sect. 6.10),
which says that in a system in equilibrium, the
kinetic energy T and the potential energy U are
related according to the equation
2T + U = 0.
(19.3)
Since ellipticals rotate slowly, the kinetic energy
of the stars may be written
T = Mv2/2,
(19.4)
where M is the total mass of the galaxy and v the
velocity width of the spectral lines. The potential
energy is
U = −GM2/2R,
(19.5)
where R is a suitable average radius of the galaxy
that can be estimated or calculated from the light
distribution. Introducing (19.4) and (19.5) into
(19.3) we obtain:
M = 2v2R/G.
(19.6)
From this formula the mass of an elliptical
galaxy can be calculated when v2 and R are
known. Some observations of velocities in ellipti-

cal galaxies are given in Fig. 19.10. These will be
further discussed in Sect. 19.4. The value of M/L
derived from such observations is about 10 within
a radius of 10 kpc. The mass of a bright elliptical
might thus be up to 1013 M⊙.
The masses of spiral galaxies are obtained
from their rotation curve v(R), which gives the
variation of their rotational velocity with radius.
Assuming that most of the mass is in the almost
spherical bulge, the mass within radius R, M(R),
can be estimated from Kepler’s third law:
M(R) = Rv(R)2/G.
(19.7)
Some typical rotation curves are shown in
Fig. 19.11. In the outer parts of many spirals,
v(R) does not depend on R. This means that
M(R) is directly proportional to the radius—the
further out one goes, the larger the interior mass
is. Since the outer parts of spirals are very faint,
at large radii the value of M/L is directly pro-
portional to the radius. For the disk, one ﬁnds
that M/L = 8 for early and M/L = 4 for late
spiral types. The largest measured total mass is
2 × 1012 M⊙.
In order to measure the mass at even larger
radii where no emission can be detected, motions
in systems of galaxies have to be used. One pos-
sibility is to use pairs of galaxies. In principle, the
method is the same as for binary stars. However,
because the orbital period of a binary galaxy is
about 109 years, only statistical information can

be obtained in this way. The results are still uncer-
tain, but seem to indicate values of M/L = 20–30
at pair separations of about 50 kpc.
A fourth method to determine galaxy masses
is to apply the virial theorem to clusters of galax-
ies, assuming that these are in equilibrium. The
kinetic energy T in (19.4) can then be calcu-
lated from the observed redshifts and the poten-
tial energy U, from the separations between clus-
ter galaxies. If it is assumed that the masses of
galaxies are proportional to their luminosities, it
is found that M/L is about 200 within 1 Mpc of
the cluster centre. However, there is a large vari-
ation from cluster to cluster.
There are also two newer and more accu-
rate methods for mass determination. The ﬁfth
method utilises the X-ray radiation coming from
the hot gas around galaxies or galaxy clusters
(Fig. 19.12). The temperature of the gas around
galaxy clusters is as high as 107, even E8 K. Since
cloud seems to be more or less stable there must
be a massive gravitational well preventing the gas
from escaping. The dependence between the total
mass of the galaxy cluster and the gas tempera-
ture is almost linear: the hotter the gas the more
mass there is. The total mass of the richest galaxy
clusters is over 1015 solar masses, and only about
1 % of this is in the form of visible matter.
Gravitational lenses (Sect. 19.7) are the most
accurate method. A light ray passing by a galaxy
is bent and the amount of bending depends on the
mass of the galaxy. The method is generally used
to determine masses of galaxy clusters but it can
also be used for individual galaxies if the lensing
galaxy forms several images of the background
object or clearly distorts its shape. Gravitational
lenses have ﬁnally conﬁrmed that only about one
sixth of the mass of galaxies is ordinary matter
(like stars or gas) and the rest dark matter.
Dark Matter
the most precise value for the
dark matter has been obtained by the WMAP and
Planck satellites which have studied the details
of the cosmic background radiation. As it will be
mentioned in Chap. 20, about 31 % of the total
content (mass + energy) of the universe is mat-
ter. The ﬁnal results of the Planck satellite pub-
lished in 2015 show that the contribution of ordi-
nary matter is 5 % and of cold dark matter 26 %.
The distribution of the dark matter can nowa-
days be determined by weak and strong gravita-
tional lenses. The result is that the dark matter

gravitational lenses. (NASA, ESA, Harald Ebeling (Uni-
versity of Hawaii at Manoa) & Jean-Paul Kneib (LAM))
appears as wide halos around galaxies and galaxy
clusters (Fig. 19.13).
The nature of the dark matter is not yet known.
It interacts with baryons almost only by its grav-
ity. It is known to be “cold”, which means that
the velocities of the particles are low unlike with
neutrinos that always travel almost at the speed of
light.
It is assumed that the dark matter consists
of unknown elementary particles. Possible candi-
dates are light axions or heavy particles predicted
by supersymmetry theories (WIMP, weakly in-
teracting massive particle) like neutralinos. Their
mass might be of the order 100 GeV–1 TeV, or
hundreds of proton masses. Underground scintil-
lation detectors and the LHC accelerator at the
CERN are used to search for particles of the dark
matter.

Ellipticals and Bulges
In all galaxies the oldest
stars have a more or less round distribution. In the
Milky Way this component is represented by the
population II stars. Its inner parts are called the
bulge, and its outer parts are often referred to as
the halo. There does not appear to be any phys-
ically signiﬁcant difference between the bulge
and the halo. The population of old stars can be
best studied in ellipticals, which only contain this
component. The bulges of spiral and S0 galaxies
are very similar to ellipticals of the same size.
The surface brightness distribution in elliptical
galaxies essentially depends only on the distance
from the centre and the orientation of the major
and minor axis. If r is the radius along the major
axis, the surface brightness I(r) is well described
by de Vaucouleurs’ law:
log I(r)
Ie
= −3.33
 r
re
1/4

.
(19.8)
The constants in (19.8) have been chosen so
that half of the total light of the galaxy is ra-
diated from within the radius re and the sur-
face brightness at that radius is Ie. The parame-
ters re and Ie are determined by ﬁtting (19.8) to
observed brightness proﬁles. Typical values for
elliptical, normal spiral and S0 galaxies are in
the ranges re = 1–10 kpc and Ie corresponds to
20–23 magnitudes per square arc second.

to a straight line in this representation. It ﬁts well with
an E galaxy, but for type cD the luminosity falls off more
slowly in the outer regions. Comparison with Fig. 19.15
shows that the brightness distribution in S0 galaxies be-
haves in a similar fashion. cD galaxies have often been
erroneously classiﬁed as S0. (Thuan, T.X., Romanishin,
W. (1981): Astrophys. J. 248, 439)

Suppl. 46, 177)
Although de Vaucouleurs’ law is a purely
empirical relation, it still gives a remarkably
good representation of the observed light distri-
bution. However, in the outer regions of ellipti-
cal galaxies, departures may often occur: the sur-
face brightness of dwarf spheroidals often falls
off more rapidly than (19.8), perhaps because
the outer parts of these galaxies have been torn
off in tidal encounters with other galaxies. In
the giant galaxies of type cD, the surface bright-
ness falls off more slowly (see Fig. 19.14). Such
galaxies are usually at the centre of dense galaxy
clusters, and during billions of years they have
absorbed several smaller galaxies. The stars of
the disrupted galaxies usually remain orbiting
the giant galaxy in its outskirts increasing the
brightness of the outer parts. cD galaxies have
been called the cannibals of the world of galax-
ies.
Although the isophotes in elliptical galaxies
are ellipses to a good approximation, their el-
lipticities and the orientation of their major axes
may vary as a function of radius. Different galax-
ies differ widely in this respect, indicating that

19.3
Galactic Structures
399
the structure of ellipticals is not as simple as it
might appear. In particular, the fact that the direc-
tion of the major axis sometimes changes within
a galaxy suggests that some ellipticals may not
be axially symmetric in shape. A probable reason
is that many galaxies of different shapes rotating
in different directions have assimilated to the cur-
rent galaxies.
From the distribution of surface brightness,
the three-dimensional structure of a galaxy may
be inferred as explained in Box 19.1. The rela-
tion (19.8) gives a brightness proﬁle which is very
strongly peaked towards the centre. The real dis-
tribution of axial ratios for ellipticals can be sta-
tistically inferred from the observed one. On the
(questionable) assumption that they are rotation-
ally symmetric, one obtains a broad distribution
with a maximum corresponding to types E3–E4.
If the true shape is not axisymmetric, it cannot
even statistically be uniquely determined from
the observations.
Disks
A bright, massive stellar disk is char-
acteristic for S0 and spiral galaxies, which are
therefore called disk galaxies. There are indica-
tions that in some ellipticals there is also a faint
disk hidden behind the bright bulge. In the Milky
Way the disk is formed by population I stars.
The distribution of surface brightness in the
disk is described by the expression
I(r) = I0 e−r/r0.
(19.9)
Figure 19.11 shows how the observed radial
brightness distribution can be decomposed into
a sum of two components: a centrally domi-
nant bulge and a disk contributing signiﬁcantly at
larger radii. The central surface brightness I0 typ-
ically corresponds to 21–22 mag./sq.arcsec, and
the radial scale length r0 = 1–5 kpc. In Sc galax-
ies the total brightness of the bulge is generally
slightly smaller than that of the disk, whereas in
earlier Hubble types the bulge has a larger total
brightness. The thickness of the disk, measured
in galaxies that are seen edge-on, may typically
be about 1.2 kpc. Sometimes the disk has a sharp
outer edge at about 4r0.
The Interstellar Medium
Elliptical and S0 ga-
laxies contain very little interstellar gas. How-
ever, in some ellipticals neutral hydrogen amount-
ing to about 0.1 % of the total mass has been de-
tected, and in the same galaxies there are also
often signs of recent star formation. In some
S0 galaxies much larger gas masses have been
observed, but the relative amount of gas is very
variable from one galaxy to another. The lack of
gas in these galaxies is rather unexpected, since
during their evolution the stars release much more
gas than is observed.
The relative amount of neutral hydrogen in
spiral galaxies is correlated with their Hubble
type. Thus Sa spirals contain about 2 %, Sc spi-
rals 10 %, and Irr I galaxies up to 30 % or more.
The distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen
has been mapped in detail in nearby galaxies by
means of radio observations. In the inner parts of
galaxies the gas forms a thin disk with a fairly
constant thickness of about 200 pc, sometimes
with a central hole of a few kpc diameter. The gas
disk may continue far outside the optical disk, be-
coming thicker and often warped from the central
disk plane.
Most of the interstellar gas in spiral galaxies is
in the form of molecular hydrogen. The hydrogen
molecule cannot be observed directly, but the dis-
tribution of carbon monoxide has been mapped
by radio observations. The distribution of molec-
ular hydrogen can then be derived by assuming
that the ratio between the densities of CO and H2
is everywhere the same, although this may not
always be true. It is found that the distribution
obeys a similar exponential law as the young stars
and H II regions, although in some galaxies (such
as the Milky Way) there is a central density min-
imum. The surface density of molecular gas may
be ﬁve times larger than that of H I, but because
of its strong central concentration its total mass is
only perhaps two times larger.
The distribution of cosmic rays and magnetic
ﬁelds in galaxies can be mapped by means of
radio observations of the synchrotron radiation
from relativistic electrons. The strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld deduced in this way is typically
0.5–1 nT. The observed emission is polarised,

showing that the magnetic ﬁeld is fairly well-
ordered on large scales. Since the plane of po-
larisation is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld,
the large-scale structure of the magnetic ﬁeld can
be mapped. However, the plane of polarisation is
changed by Faraday rotation, and for this reason
observations at several wavelengths are needed in
order to determine the direction of the ﬁeld. The
results show that the ﬁeld is generally strongest
in the plane of the disk, and is directed along
the spiral arms in the plane. The ﬁeld is thought
to have been produced by the combined action
of rising elements of gas, perhaps produced by
supernova explosions, and the differential rota-
tion, in principle in the same way as the pro-
duction of solar magnetic ﬁelds was explained in
Chap. 13.
The Outer Parts of Galaxies
Even the outer-
most parts outside the visible disk are not empty.
Recently they have been seen to contain several
different kinds of matter. The most abundant is
the dark matter extending around the galaxy as a
sphere or slightly ﬂattened ellipsoid to a distance
of tens of times further than the visible matter.
Hot gas is the second largest component. Its
high temperature and great abundance were sur-
prising. For example, the Milky Way is sur-
rounded by a region of hot gas extending as a
spherical cloud as far as to 150 kiloparsecs. The
temperature of the gas is 1–2.5 × 106 K and the
total mass about the same order of magnitude as
the total mass of the stars in the Milky Way.
The third component comprises of separate
gas clouds having greater velocities than other
matter of the galaxy. Some of the clouds come
from the centre of the Milky Way, some from
other galaxies.
Yet another component consists of star clusters
and star streams. In addition to globular clusters

19.4
Dynamics of Galaxies
401
galaxies are accompanied by star concentrations
that are remnants of dwarf galaxies assimilated
to the galaxy. For example, the globular cluster
M54 is not an original Milky Way cluster but a
remnant of the Sagittarius dwarf ellipsoid moving
through the central part of the Milky Way. Dis-
rupting dwarf galaxies are sometimes seen as star
streams around the galaxy (Fig. 19.16).
Box 19.1 (Three-Dimensional Shape of Galax-
ies) Equations (19.8) and (19.9) describe the
distribution of galactic light projected on the
plane of the sky. The actual three-dimensional
luminosity distribution in a galaxy is obtained
by inverting the projection. This is easiest for
spherical galaxies.
Let us suppose that a spherical galaxy has
the projected luminosity distribution I(r) (e.g.
as in (19.8)). With coordinates chosen ac-
cording to the ﬁgure, I(r) is given in terms
of the three-dimensional luminosity distribu-
tion ρ(R) by
I(r) =
 ∞
−∞
ρ(R)dz.
Since z2 = R2 −r2, a change of the variable of
integration yields
I(r) = 2
 ∞

This is known as an Abel integral equation
for ρ(R), and has the solution

Introducing the observed I(r) into this expres-
sion, one obtains the actual luminosity dis-
tribution ρ(R). In the ﬁgure the solid curve
shows the three-dimensional luminosity distri-
bution obtained from the Vaucouleurs’ law (the
dashed line).
If the galaxy is not spherical, its three-
dimensional shape can only be determined if
its inclination with respect to the line of sight
is known. Since galactic disks are thin and of
constant thickness, the inclination i of a disk
galaxy is obtained directly from the axis ratio
of its projected image: sini = b/a.
When the inclination is known, the real axis
ratio of the bulge q0 can be determined from the
projected value q. For a rotationally symmetric
bulge the relation between q and q0 is
cos2 i = 1 −q2
1 −q2
0
.
The ﬂattenings of disk galaxy bulges obtained
from this relation lie in the range q0 = 0.3–0.5.
Since the inclinations of ellipticals are gener-
ally unknown, only the statistical distribution
of q can be determined from that of q0.
19.4
Dynamics of Galaxies
We have seen how the masses of galaxies can be
derived from observed velocities of stars and gas.

402
19
Galaxies
The same observations can be used to study the
internal distribution of mass in more detail.
Slowly Rotating Systems
The dynamics of el-
liptical galaxies and disk galaxy bulges are stud-
ied by means of the Doppler shifts and broad-
enings of stellar absorption lines. Since a given
absorption line is the sum of contributions from
many individual stars, its Doppler shift gives their
mean velocity, while its broadening is increased
by an amount depending on the dispersion of stel-
lar velocities around the mean. By observing how
the wavelengths and widths of spectral lines be-
have as functions of the radius, one can get some
insight into the distribution of mass in the galaxy.
Examples of the observed radial dependence
of the rotational velocity and velocity disper-
sion derived for some ellipticals were given in
Fig. 19.10. The observed rotational velocities are
often small (<100 kms−1), while the velocity
dispersion may typically be about 200 km s−1. If
elliptical galaxies were in fact ellipsoids of revo-
lution, there should be a statistical relation (when
projection effects have been taken into account)
between ﬂatness, rotational velocity and velocity
dispersion. Such a relationship has been observed
for fainter ellipticals and for disk galaxy bulges.
However, some of the brightest ellipticals rotate
very slowly. Therefore their ﬂattening cannot be
due to rotation.
The radial dependence of the velocity disper-
sion gives information on the distribution of mass
within the galaxy. Since it also depends on how
the shapes of stellar orbits in the galaxy are dis-
tributed, its interpretation requires detailed dy-
namical models.
Some ellipticals have different velocity sys-
tems. An extreme case is NGC 4550 classiﬁed as
E7/S0. Half of its stars orbit the centre in one di-
rection and the rest in the opposite direction. This
indicates that the galaxy is a merger of two spiral
galaxies that originally rotated in opposite direc-
tions. Mutual distances of stars in ellipticals are
so large that collisions do not occur and the cur-
rent system is very stable.
Rotation Curves
In spiral galaxies the distri-
bution of mass can be studied directly using the
observed rotational velocities of the interstellar
gas. This can be observed either at optical wave-
lengths from the emission lines of ionised gas
in H II regions or at radio wavelengths from the
hydrogen 21 cm line. Typical galactic rotation
curves were shown in Fig. 19.11.
The qualitative behaviour of the rotation curve
in all spiral galaxies is similar to the rotation
curve of the Milky Way: there is a central por-
tion, where the rotational velocity is directly pro-
portional to the radius, corresponding to rigid
body rotation. At a few kpc radius the curve turns
over and becomes ﬂat, i.e. the rotational veloc-
ity does not depend on the radius. In early Hub-
ble types, the rotation curve rises more steeply
near the centre and reaches larger velocities in
the ﬂat region (Sa about 300 km s−1, Sc about
200 km s−1). A higher rotational velocity indi-
cates a larger mass according to (19.7), and thus
Sa types must have a larger mass density near
the centre. This is not unexpected, since a more
massive bulge is one of the deﬁning properties of
early type spirals.
A decrease of the rotational velocity at large
radii would be an indication that most of the mass
is inside that radius. In some galaxies such a de-
crease has been detected, in others the rotational
velocity remains constant as far out as the obser-
vations can reach.
Spiral Structure
Spiral galaxies (Fig. 19.17)
are relatively bright objects. Some have a well-
deﬁned, large-scale two-armed spiral pattern,
whereas in others the spiral structure is made up
of a large number of short ﬁlamentary arms. From
galaxies where the pattern is seen in front of the
central bulge, it has been deduced that the sense
of winding of the spiral is trailing with respect
to the rotation of the galaxy. However, the rule is
not absolute: there are also galaxies with leading
arms.
The spiral structure is most clearly seen in the
interstellar dust, H II regions, and the OB asso-
ciations formed by young stars. The dust often
forms thin lanes along the inner edge of the spiral
arms, with star forming regions on their outside.
Enhanced synchrotron radio emission associated
with spiral arms has also been detected.

A well formed wide spiral pattern is relatively
common, and hence it must be a long lasting phe-
nomenon. The spiral pattern is generally thought
to be a wave in the density of the stellar disk,
as discussed in Sect. 18.4. As the interstellar
gas streams through the density wave a shock,
marked by the dust lanes, is formed as the in-
terstellar gas is compressed, leading to the col-
lapse of molecular clouds and the formation of
stars. The density wave theory predicts charac-
teristic streaming motions within the arm, which
have been detected in some galaxies by observa-
tions of the H I 21 cm line.
There may be several reasons producing spiral
arms. The most common is an external perturba-
tion when another galaxy passes by at a close dis-

404

tance creating a wave in the galaxy. Other sources
of perturbation could be the bar of the galaxy or
the gravitational ﬁeld of a temporary “trafﬁc jam”
of stars.
A single close encounter or a trafﬁc jam can
explain temporary spiral arms but not more per-
manent features. The differential rotation of the
galaxy tends to wipe out the arms during a few
revolutions or in a few hundreds of millions of
years. Some renewal mechanism is needed to
keep the arms permanent.
Standing waves can explain the permanence.
Birth of spiral arms and their motion gener-
ate density waves travelling through the whole
galaxy. The waves can be reﬂected or refracted
by the central bulge. When wave fronts moving
in different directions meet they can either damp
or amplify each others. Spiral arms are standing
waves, fronts of ampliﬁed waves, seen as concen-
trates of stars and gas clouds. The spiral forms
move around the galaxy at constant speed.

Stellar Ages and Element
Abundances in Galaxies
From the Milky Way we know that stars of pop-
ulations I and II are different not only in respect
to their spatial distribution, but also in respect to
their ages and heavy element abundances. This
fact gives important evidence about the formation
of the Milky Way, and it is therefore of interest if
a similar connection can be found in other galax-
ies.
The indicators of composition most easily
measured are the variations of colour indices in-
side galaxies and between different galaxies. Two
regularities have been discovered in these varia-
tions: First, according to the colour–luminosity
relation for elliptical and S0 galaxies, brighter
galaxies are redder. Secondly, there is a colour–
aperture effect, so that the central parts of galax-
ies are redder. For spirals this relationship is due
to the presence of young, massive stars in the
disk, but it has also been observed for elliptical
and S0 galaxies.
Galactic spectra are composed of the spectra
of all their stars added together. Thus the colours
depend both on the ages of the stars (young stars
are bluer) and on the heavy element abundance Z
(stars with larger Z are redder). The interpreta-
tion of the observational results thus has to be
based on detailed modelling of the stellar com-
position of galaxies or population synthesis.
Stars of different spectral classes contribute
different characteristic absorption features to the
galaxy spectrum. By observing the strength of
various spectral features, one can ﬁnd out about
the masses, ages and chemical composition of
the stars that make up the galaxy. For this pur-
pose, a large number of characteristic properties
of the spectrum, strengths of absorption lines and
broad-band colours are measured. One then at-
tempts to reproduce these data, using a represen-
tative collection of stellar spectra. If no satisfac-
tory solution can be found, more stars have to
be added to the model. The ﬁnal result is a pop-
ulation model, giving the stellar composition of
the galaxy. Combining this with theoretical stellar
evolution calculations, the evolution of the light
of the galaxy can also be computed.
Population synthesis of E galaxies show that
practically all their stars were formed simulta-
neously about 13–14 × 109 years ago, which is
close to the age of the universe Most of their light
comes from red giants, whereas most of their
mass resides in lower main sequence stars of less
than one solar mass.
Since all stars have roughly the same age, the
colours of elliptical galaxies are directly related
to their metallicities. Thus the colour–luminosity
relation indicates that Z in giant ellipticals may
be double that in the solar neighbourhood, while
it may be smaller by a factor 100 in dwarfs. Simi-
larly, the radial dependence of the colours can be
explained if the value of Z at the centre is an or-
der of magnitude larger than it is at larger radii.
The stellar composition of disk galaxy bulges
is generally similar to that of ellipticals. The ele-
ment abundances in the gas in spirals can be stud-
ied by means of the emission lines from H II re-
gions ionised by newly formed stars. In this case
too, the metallicity increases towards the centre.
The birth histories of galaxies explain partly
the different metallicities and age distributions.
As we will see later, galaxies collide and merge
in the span of billions of years. Most clearly this

19.6
Systems of Galaxies

is seen in dwarf galaxies having sow few stars
that even a single merger leaves a distinct signa-
ture. Figure 19.18 shows the age distribution of
two Milky Way’s neighbour galaxies. A few of
the stars of Leo A were born immediately after
the origin of the universe but most of the stars
were born during the last 5–6 billion years. The
stars of the Carina dwarf galaxy were born dur-
ing three separate periods, at the age of 1–2, 6–8
and about 11 billion years.
19.6
Systems of Galaxies
The galaxies are not smoothly distributed in
space; rather, they form systems of all sizes:
galaxy pairs, small groups, large clusters and su-
perclusters formed from several groups and clus-
ters. The larger a given system, the less its density
exceeds the mean density of the Universe. On the
average, the density is twice the background den-
sity for systems of radius 5 Mpc and 10 % above
the background at radius 20 Mpc.
Interactions of Galaxies
Galaxies do not
evolve in isolation; instead, they interact continu-
ously with other galaxies. Each large galaxy has
experienced encounters or collisions with several
other large galaxies and tens or even hundreds
encounters with much smaller galaxies.
Among the most common distortions are
“bridges” and “tails” caused by tidal forces dur-
ing an encounter (Fig. 19.19). Sometimes a small
galaxy breaks down and forms a ring in the equa-
torial plane of the larger galaxy or sometimes on
a polar orbit. The most striking ring galaxies are
born when a dense galaxy passes straight through
another one (Fig. 19.20). In many cases the ef-
fects of collisions are seen as starbursts when the
gas and dust clouds of the galaxies meet, con-
dense and start to produce new stars. Sometimes
image processing is needed to show faint but
sharp rings around a galaxy (Fig. 19.21).
The interactions between galaxies are not al-
ways dramatic. For example, the Milky Way
has two satellites, the Large and Small Mag-
ellanic Clouds (see Fig. 19.5), which are Irr I
type dwarf galaxies at about 60 kpc distance.
It is thought that approximately 5 × 108 years
Fig. 19.18 The age distribution of the dwarf galaxies in
Leo and Carina shows that the stars of the galaxies were
formed in separate collision episodes. (Tolstoy, Hill, Tosi,
2009, Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 47, 371)
ago, these passed the Milky Way at a distance of
about 10–15 kpc, leaving behind the Magellanic
Stream, a 180◦long thin stream of neutral hy-
drogen clouds. Systems of this type, where a gi-
ant galaxy is surrounded by a few small compan-
ions, are quite common. Computations show that
in many such cases the tidal interactions are so
strong that the companions will merge with the
parent galaxy at the next close approach. This is
likely to happen to the Magellanic Clouds.
During earlier epochs in the Universe, when
the density was larger, interactions between galax-
ies must have been much more common than at
present. Thus it has been proposed that a large
fraction of bright galaxies have undergone ma-
jor mergers at some stage in their history. In
particular, there are good reasons to believe that
the slowly rotating, non-axisymmetric giant el-
lipticals may have formed by the merger of disk
galaxies.

Groups
The most common type of galaxy sys-
tems are small, irregular groups of a few tens of
galaxies. A typical example is the Local Group,
which contains two larger galaxies in addition to
the Milky Way—the Andromeda Galaxy M31,
an Sb spiral of about the same size as the Milky
Way with two dwarf companions, and the smaller
Sc spiral M33. The rest of the about 50 members
of the Local Group are dwarfs; about 20 are of
type dE and 10 of type Irr I. The diameter of the
Local Group is about 1.2 Mpc.
Clusters
A system of galaxies may be deﬁned
to be a cluster if it contains a larger number (at
least 50) of bright galaxies. The number of mem-
bers and the size of a cluster depend on how they
are deﬁned. One way of doing this is to ﬁt the

observed distribution of galaxies within a cluster
with an expression of the form (19.8). In this way
a characteristic cluster radius of about 2–5 Mpc is
obtained. The number of members depends both
on the cluster radius and on the limiting magni-
tude. A large cluster may contain several hundred
galaxies that are less than two magnitudes fainter
than the characteristic luminosity L∗of (19.2).
Clusters of galaxies can be ordered in a se-
quence from extended, low-density, irregular sys-
tems (sometimes called clouds of galaxies) to
denser and more regular structures (Fig. 19.23).
The galaxy type composition also varies along
this sequence in the sense that in the loose irregu-
lar clusters, the bright galaxies are predominantly
spirals, whereas the members of dense clusters
are almost exclusively type E and S0. The nearest
cluster of galaxies is the Virgo Cluster at a dis-
tance of about 15 Mpc. It is a relatively irregu-
lar cluster, where a denser central region contain-
ing early galaxy types is surrounded by a more
extended distribution of mainly spiral galaxies.
The nearest regular cluster is the Coma Cluster,
Fig. 19.22 A theoretical X-ray spectrum for plasma with
a temperature of 108 K. Most of the radiation comes
from the bremsstrahlung of electrons, peaking at 8.6 kilo-
electronvolts (thick line). Superimposed are spectral lines

roughly 90 Mpc away. In the Coma Cluster a cen-
tral pair of giant ellipticals is surrounded by a ﬂat-

tened (axis ratio about 2 : 1) system of early type
galaxies.
Earlier galaxy groups were studied as con-
glomerates of visible galaxies. Recently two
other, more massive, components have been in-
cluded.
First of all, galaxy clusters are surrounded
by large clouds of hot gas, as mentioned in
Sect. 19.2. The gas can be observed by its X-
ray emission. The spectrum shows features typ-
ical for bremsstrahlung of electrons and lines of
totally ionised metals (like FeXXIV). Tempera-
ture measured from X-ray spectra are 107–108 K.
The total mass of the gas in the poorest clusters
is about 5 times and in the richest clusters even
20 times as big as the mass inside the galaxies.
Part of the gas comes from the galaxies (jets of

19.7
Active Galaxies and Quasars
409
quasars, supernova explosions), but most of it is
hydrogen and helium from the big bang.
Besides in X-ray images the existence of the
hot gas is seen also as extra spots in the cosmic
background radiation, caused by the Sunyayev-
Zel’dovich effect. Photons of the background ra-
diation hit electrons of the hot gas and receive
some extra energy (inverse Compton scattering).
Below 218 GHz the radiation is slightly cooler
and above 218 GHz a little brighter. The diameter
of the spot is about one arc minute and the tem-
perature difference from the surroundings 0.1–1
millikelvins (Fig. 19.25). One of the main objec-
tives of the Planck satellite was to ﬁnd gas clouds
around galaxy clusters using this phenomenon.
The ﬁnal catalogue of Planck (2015) contains
over 1600 objects most of which are previously
unknown galaxies with redshifts z = 0 −1.5.
Without a strong source of gravitation the hot
gas would quickly disperse into space. The grav-
itation is caused by dark matter; its mass is about
ﬁve times as big as that of the ordinary matter
(hot gas + visible galaxies) in the cluster. Grav-
itational lenses have been used to investigate the
dark matter in galaxy clusters (Sect. 19.7).
Superclusters
Groups and clusters of galaxies
may form even larger systems, superclusters. For
example, the Local Group belongs to the Lo-
cal Supercluster, a ﬂattened system whose centre
is the Virgo Cluster, containing tens of smaller
groups and clouds of galaxies. The Coma Clus-
ter is part of another supercluster. The diame-
ters of superclusters are 10–20 Mpc. However,
on this scale, it is no longer clear whether one
can reasonably speak of individual systems. Per-
haps it would be more accurate to think of the
distribution of galaxies as a continuous network,
where the large clusters are connected by walls
and strings formed by smaller systems. Between
these there remain empty regions containing very
few galaxies, which can be up to 50 Mpc in di-
ameter (Figs. 19.24, 20.8).
19.7
Active Galaxies and Quasars
So far in this chapter we have been concerned
with the properties of normal galaxies. In some

ble constant. The thickness of the slices is about 10◦.

galaxies, however, the normal galaxy is overshad-
owed by violent activity. This activity is produced
in the nucleus, which is then called an active
galactic nucleus (AGN).
The luminosities of active galactic nuclei may
be extremely large, sometimes much larger than
that of the rest of the galaxy. It seems unlikely
that a galaxy could maintain such a large power
output for long. For this reason it is thought that
active galaxies do not form a separate class of
galaxies, but rather represent a passing stage in
the evolution of normal galaxies.
Activity appears in many different forms.
Some galaxies have an exceptionally bright nu-
cleus similar to a large region of ionised hydro-
gen. These may be young galaxies, where near

and the total mass of the galaxy cluster about 1015 solar
masses. Optical images of the same location show a dis-
tant galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2106–5844, which has a red-
shift z = 1.13. (Foley, Andersson, Bazin, de Haan, Ruel et
al., 2011, ApJ 731, p. 89)
the centre large numbers of stars are forming and
evolving into supernovae (starburst nuclei). In
other nuclei the radiation cannot have been pro-
duced by stars, and the most plausible source of
energy in these nuclei is the gravitational energy
of a supermassive black hole (mass > 108 M⊙).
In some galaxies, the spectral lines are unusually
broad, indicating large internal velocities. These
may be either rotational velocities near a black
hole or due to explosive events in the nucleus.
In some galaxies, jets are seen coming out of the
nucleus. Many active galaxies radiate a nonther-
mal spectrum, apparently synchrotron radiation
produced by fast electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld.
The classiﬁcation of active galaxies has been
developed rather unsystematically, since many
of them have been discovered only recently, and
have not been completely studied. For example,
the Markarian galaxies catalogued by Benyamin
Yerishevich Markarian in the early 1970’s are
deﬁned by strong ultraviolet emission. Many
Markarian galaxies are Seyfert galaxies; others
are galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation.
The N galaxies form another class closely similar
to the Seyfert galaxies.
Two natural basic classes of active galaxies are
the Seyfert galaxies and the radio galaxies. The
former are spirals; the latter are ellipticals. Some
astronomers think that the Seyfert galaxies repre-
sent the active stage of normal spiral galaxies and
the radio galaxies that of ellipticals.
Seyfert Galaxies
The Seyfert galaxies are
named after Carl Seyfert, who discovered them
in 1943. Their most important characteristics are
a bright, pointlike central nucleus and a spectrum
showing broad emission lines. The continuous
spectrum has a nonthermal component, which is
most prominent in the ultraviolet. The emission
lines are thought to be produced in gas clouds
moving close to the nucleus with large velocities.
On the basis of the spectrum, Seyfert galaxies
are classiﬁed as type 1 or 2. In a type 1 spec-
trum, the allowed lines are broad (correspond-
ing to a velocity of 104 kms−1), much broader
than the forbidden lines. In type 2, all lines are
similar and narrower (<103 kms−1). Transitions
between these types and intermediate cases have
sometimes been observed. The reason for the dif-
ference is thought to be that the allowed lines are
formed in denser gas near the nucleus, and the
forbidden lines in more diffuse gas further out. In
type 2 Seyfert galaxies, the denser gas is missing
or obscured.
Almost all Seyfert galaxies with known Hub-
ble types are spirals; the possible exceptions
are of type 2. They are strong infrared sources.
Type 1 galaxies often show strong X-ray emis-
sion.
The true Seyfert galaxies are relatively weak
radio sources. However, there are compact ra-
dio galaxies with an optical spectrum that is es-
sentially the same as for Seyfert galaxies. These
should probably be classiﬁed with the Seyfert
galaxies. In general, the stronger radio emission
seems to come with a type 2 spectrum.
It is estimated that about 1 % of all bright spi-
ral galaxies are Seyfert galaxies. The luminosi-
ties of their nuclei are about 1036–1039 W, of the

19.7

same order as all the rest of the galaxy. Brightness
variations are common.
Radio Galaxies
By deﬁnition, radio galaxies
are galaxies that are powerful radio sources. The
radio emission of a radio galaxy is non-thermal
synchrotron radiation. The radio luminosity of ra-
dio galaxies is typically 1033–1038 W, and may
thus be as large as the total luminosity of a nor-
mal galaxy. The main problem in explaining ra-
dio emission is to understand how the electrons
and magnetic ﬁelds are produced, and above all,
where the electrons get their energy.
The forms and sizes of the radio emitting re-
gions of radio galaxies have been studied ever
since the 1950’s, when radio interferometers
achieved the resolution of optical telescopes. The
characteristic feature of a strong radio galaxy is
a double structure: there are two large radio emit-
ting regions on opposite sides of the observed
galaxy. The radio emitting regions of some ra-
dio galaxies are as far apart as 6 Mpc, almost ten
times the distance between the Milky Way and
Andromeda galaxies. One of the smallest dou-
ble radio sources is the galaxy M87 (Fig. 19.26),
whose two components are only a few kpc distant
from each other.
The double structure of radio galaxies appears
to be produced by ejections from the nucleus.
However, the electrons in the radio lobes can-
not be coming from the centre of the galaxy, be-
cause they would lose all their energy during such
a long transit. Therefore electrons have to be con-
tinuously accelerated within the radio-emitting
regions. Within the radio lobes there are almost
point-like regions, hot spots. These are generally
symmetrically placed with respect to the nucleus,
and are apparently consequences of nuclear ejec-
tions.
“Tailed” radio sources also exist. Their ra-
dio emission mainly comes from one side of the
galaxy, forming a curved tail, which is often tens
of times longer than the diameter of the galaxy.
The best examples are NGC 1265 in the Perseus
cluster of galaxies and 3C129, which appears
to be in an elliptical orbit around a companion
galaxy. The tail is interpreted as the trail left by
the radio galaxy in intergalactic space.
Another special feature revealed by the radio
maps is the presence of jets, narrow lines of ra-
dio emission, usually starting in the nucleus and
stretching far outside the galaxy. The best known
may be the M87 jet, which has also been observed
as an optical and X-ray jet. The optically ob-
served jet is surrounded by a radio source. A simi-
lar radio source is seen on the opposite side of the
nucleus, where no optical jet is seen. Our near-
est radio galaxy Centaurus A also has a jet ex-
tending from the nucleus to near the edge of the
galaxy.
VLBI observations of radio jets have also re-
vealed superluminal motions: in many compact
sources the components appear to be separating
faster than the speed of light. Since such veloci-
ties are impossible according to the theory of rel-
ativity, the observed velocities can only be appar-
ent, and several models have been proposed to ac-
count for them.
Quasars
The ﬁrst quasar was discovered in
1963, when Maarten Schmidt interpreted the op-
tical emission lines of the known radio source
3C273 as hydrogen Balmer lines redshifted by
16 %. Such large redshifts are the most re-
markable characteristics of the quasars. Properly
speaking, the word quasar is an abbreviation for
quasistellar radio source, and some astronomers
prefer to use the designation QSO (quasistellar
object), since not all quasars emit radio radia-
tion.
Optically the quasars appear almost as point
sources, although improved observational tech-
niques have revealed an increasing number of
quasars located inside more or less normal galax-
ies (Fig. 19.27). Although the ﬁrst quasars where
discovered by radio observations, only a small
fraction of all optically identiﬁed quasars are
bright radio sources. Most radio quasars are point
sources, but some have a double structure like the
radio galaxies. Satellite X-ray pictures also show
the quasars to be pointlike.
In the visible region the quasar spectra are
dominated by spectral lines with rest wavelengths
in the ultraviolet. The ﬁrst observed quasar red-
shifts were z = 0.16 and 0.37, and later searches
have continued to turn up ever larger redshifts.

The present record is 8.7, but three objects have
redshift 10. If these are quasars their light must
have been emitted when the age of the universe
was only 500 million years. The large inferred
distances of the quasars mean that their luminosi-
ties have to be extremely large. Typical values lie
in the range of 1038–1041 W. The brightness of
quasars may vary rapidly, within a few days or
less. Thus the emitting region can be no larger
than a few light-days, i.e. about 100 au.
The quasars often have both emission and ab-
sorption lines in their spectra. The emission lines
are very broad and are probably produced in
the quasar itself. Much of the absorption spec-

trum consists of densely distributed narrow lines
that are thought to be hydrogen Lyman α lines
formed in gas clouds along the line of sight to
the quasar. The clouds producing this “Lyman
α forest” (Fig. 19.28) are young galaxies or pro-
togalaxies, and they therefore provide important
evidence about the formation of galaxies. Lyman
α forests can be used to map intergalactic gas
clouds up to redshift z = 6 (Fig. 19.29). Fur-
ther out Lyman α absorption lines cannot be seen
since most of the hydrogen is neutral.
Uniﬁed Models
Although the forms of galac-
tic activity may at ﬁrst sight appear diverse, they
can be uniﬁed within a fairly widely accepted
schematic model in such a way that the properties
of each individual object depend on a few param-
eters only.

414
19
Galaxies
According to this model, most galaxies con-
tain a compact central nucleus, which is a super-
massive black hole, with mass 107–1010 M⊙, sur-
rounded by a disk or ring of gas. The source of
energy is the gravitational energy released as gas
is accreted into the black hole. The disk may also
give rise to a jet, where some of the energy is con-
verted into perpendicular motions along the rota-
tional axis. Thus active galactic nuclei are simi-
lar to the nucleus of the Milky Way, although the
masses of both the black hole and the gas disk
may be much larger.
Deducing the mass of the central black hole
is difﬁcult and uncertain. However, using a vari-
ety of methods involving the motions of stars and
gas at the centre of nearby galaxies black hole
masses for about 30 galaxies have been deter-
mined. The most important result of these studies
is that there is a close relationship between the
black hole mass and the central velocity disper-
sion of the galaxy. According to the virial theo-
rem the velocity dispersion is a measure of the
bulge mass, and therefore the conclusion is that
there is a close relationship between the mass of
the bulge and the mass of the central black hole.
The ﬁrst characteristic parameter of the uni-
ﬁed model is obviously the total luminosity. For
Fig. 19.29 Simulation of hydrogen distribution in space.
The light emitted by a quasar goes through different gas
clouds creating a Lyman α forest. (Renyue Cen, Princeton
University)
example, the only essential difference between
Seyfert 1 galaxies and radio-quiet quasars is the
larger luminosity of quasars. Another basic pa-
rameter is the radio brightness, which may be re-
lated to the strength of a jet. On the basis of their
radio luminosity one can connect Seyfert galaxies
and radio-quiet quasars on one hand, and radio
galaxies and radio quasars on the other.
The third important parameter of uniﬁed mod-
els is the angle from which we happen to view
the nuclear disk. For example, if the disk is seen
edge-on, the actual nucleus is obscured by the
disk. This could explain the difference between
Seyfert types 1 and 2: in type 2 we do not see
the broad emission lines formed near the black
hole, but only the narrower lines from the disk.
Similarly a galaxy that looks like a double radio
source when seen edge-on, would look like a ra-
dio quasar if the disk were seen face-on. In the
latter case there is a possibility that we may be
seeing an object directly along the jet. It will then
appear as a blazar, an object with rapid and vio-
lent variations in brightness and polarisation, and
very weak or invisible emission lines. If the jet
is almost relativistic, its transverse velocity may
appear larger than the speed of light, and thus su-
perluminal motions can also be understood.
One prediction of the uniﬁed model is that
there should be a large number of quasars where
the nucleus is obscured by the disk as in the
Seyfert 2 galaxies. In analogy with the Seyfert
galaxies these objects are referred to as type 2
AGN or quasars. Because of the obscuration
such sources would not be included in surveys
at optical, UV, or soft X-ray wavelengths. In
hard X-rays the obscuration is less, and in the
far infrared the absorbed energy is re-radiated.
Searches for type 2 quasars have been made at
these wavelengths with the Chandra X-ray satel-
lite and with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
indications from these searches are that at least
3/4 of all supermassive black holes are heavily
obscured.
Gravitational Lenses
An interesting pheno-
menon ﬁrst discovered in connection with quasars
are gravitational lenses. Since light rays are bent
by gravitational ﬁelds, a mass (e.g. a galaxy)

placed between a distant quasar and the observer
will distort the image of the quasar. The ﬁrst ex-
ample of this effect was discovered in 1979, when
it was found that two quasars, 5.7′′ apart in the
sky, had essentially identical spectra. It was con-
cluded that the “pair” was really a double image
of a single quasar. Since then several other grav-
itationally lensed quasars have been discovered
(Fig. 19.30).
Gravitational lenses have also been discov-
ered in clusters of galaxies. Here the gravitational
ﬁeld of the cluster distorts the images of dis-
tant galaxies into arcs around the cluster centre.
Currently some two hundred individual galaxies
and twenty galaxy clusters are known to pro-
duce lensed images of background galaxies or
quasars. Such systems are called strong gravita-
tional lenses (Fig. 19.31).

appears as two images on both sides of the lensing galaxy

by different amounts. The image of the galaxy becomes slightly ﬂattened
Recently emphasis has moved towards weak
gravitational lenses, which are much more com-
mon (Fig. 19.32). The lens does not produce sep-
arate images or arcs from a background but only
ﬂattens its shape. Since the axial ratio changes
only by 1–2 %, the weak lenses cannot be used
to study shapes of individual galaxies because
their original shapes are not known. However, if
hundreds or thousands of galaxies around a mass
concentration are measured, statistical analysis
shows the ﬂattening. In the 2010’s weak lenses
are routinely used to observe the distribution of
the invisible matters.
Figure 19.13 showed an example about dark
matter clouds around a galaxy cluster.

The Origin and Evolution of
Galaxies
Because the speed of light is ﬁnite we see distant
galaxies at earlier stages in their life. In the next
chapter we show how the age of a galaxy with
given redshift can be calculated based on the rate
of expansion of the Universe. However, this rela-
tionship will depend on the cosmological model,
which therefore always has to be speciﬁed when
studying the evolution of galaxies.
Evolution of galaxies began when the ﬁrst
stars were born at redshifts 10–20. The universe
consisted of neutral hydrogen and helium only,
and the temperature of the gas had dropped be-
low 100 kelvins. The ﬁrst stars were very mas-
sive and shortlived. Radiation from the ﬁrst stars,
galaxies and quasars rapidly ionised the interstel-
lar and intergalactic gas. This era is called the
time of ionisation. Ionisation was almost com-
plete when the redshift reached z = 6, and ever
since 99.9 % of the hydrogen has been ionised.
Towards the end of the reionisation, at redshifts
6–15, massive galaxies (M > 1010M⊙) were al-
ready born. Current observations of galaxies go
back to redshifts 10–12.
According to the currently widely accepted
cosmological models most of the matter in the
Universe is in a form that emits no radiation,
and is only observable from its gravitational ef-
fects. In this Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory
(see Sect. 20.7) the ﬁrst systems to collapse and
start forming stars were small, with masses like
those of dwarf galaxies. Larger galaxies were
formed later as these smaller fragments collected

19.8
The Origin and Evolution of Galaxies

into larger clumps. This model, where most stars
are formed in small galaxies is usually described
as the hierarchical model.
A large part of our theoretical ideas on galaxy
evolution is based on numerical simulations of
the collapse of gas clouds and star formation in
them. Using some prescription for star formation
one can try to compute the evolution of the spec-
tral energy distribution and the chemical abun-
dances in the resulting galaxies. The results of
the models can be compared with the observa-
tional data presented in the previous sections of
this chapter.
The density distribution of dark matter is ex-
pected to be very irregular, containing numerous
small-scale clumps. The collapse will therefore
be highly inhomogeneous, both in the hierarchi-
cal and in the monolithic picture, and subsequent
mergers between smaller systems should be com-
mon. There are additional complicating factors.
Gas may be expelled from the galaxy, or there
may be an inﬂux of fresh gas. Interactions with
the surroundings may radically alter the course of
evolution—in dense systems they may lead to the
complete merging of the individual galaxies into
one giant elliptical. Much remains to be learned
about how the formation of stars is affected by
the general dynamical state of the galaxy and of
how an active nucleus may inﬂuence the forma-
tion process.
Our observational knowledge of galaxy evo-
lution is advancing very rapidly. Essentially all
the relationships described earlier in this chap-
ter have been studied as functions of time. Still,
a complete generally accepted description of the
way the Universe reached its present state has not
yet been established. Here we can only mention
a few of the most central aspects of the processes
leading to the galaxies we observe to-day.
Density and Luminosity Evolution
The most
basic way of studying the formation and evolu-
tion of galaxies is by counting their numbers, ei-
ther the number brighter than some given magni-
tude limit (as was already done by Hubble in the
1930’s, see Sect. 20.1) or else the number den-
sity as a function of redshift. The counts can be
compared with the numbers expected if there is
Fig. 19.33 Galaxy counts in the U, B, I, and K wave-
length bands. The counts are compared to those in a cos-
mological model without evolution. The cosmological pa-
rameters correspond to the currently preferred “concor-
dance” model (see Sect. 19.5). (H.C. Ferguson et al., 2000,
ARAA 38, 667, Fig. 4)
Fig. 19.34 The deepest image taken by the Hubble space
telescope and published in 2014. The total exposure time
is 27 days. The original picture contains about 15,000 faint
galaxies. (NASA, ESA, H. Teplitz, M. Rafelski, A. Koeke-
moer, R. Windhorst and Z. Levay)
no evolution, which depend on the cosmological
model. They can therefore be used either as a cos-

mological test, or as a test of evolutionary mod-
els. However, the present situation is that more
reliable cosmological tests are available, and the
number counts are mainly used to study the evo-
lution of galaxies.
There are two ways in which the number
counts are affected by galaxy evolution. In den-
sity evolution the actual number of galaxies is
changing, whereas in luminosity evolution only
the luminosity of individual galaxies is evolv-
ing. The simplest form of luminosity evolution
is called passive luminosity evolution, and is due
to the changing luminosity of stars during nor-
mal stellar evolution. Pure luminosity evolution
is expected to be predominant in the monolithic
picture. In the hierarchical picture density evolu-
tion will be more prominent, since in this picture
smaller galaxies are to a greater extent being de-
stroyed to produce larger more luminous ones.
Figure 19.33 gives an example of the results of
number counts. A model without evolution can-
not explain these observed counts, and various

19.8
The Origin and Evolution of Galaxies
419
models incorporating evolutionary effects have to
be introduced. However, a unique model cannot
be determined using just the number counts.
Distant Galaxies
A more direct approach to
galaxy formation is the direct search for the most
distant objects visible. In Fig. 19.34 we show the
Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), an area of the
sky observed with the Hubble Space Telescope.
The total exposure time through different ﬁlters
was 27 days. The image contains over 15,000
galaxies. Over 5000 are seen as dots; their red-
shift is aver 6. The other ones, seen as extended
objects, give information on galaxy evolution at
redshifts 1–5.
The most important observation is that with in-
creasing redshift the Hubble classiﬁcation breaks
down and ﬁnally disappears. Around redshift
z = 3 the spiral galaxies resembling the current
ones have disappeared almost completely. In-
stead, there are different irregular and strange
galaxies.
Figure 19.35 shows examples of distant galax-
ies in the range z = 2–4. Over 10 % are “chain
galaxies”, about 20 % “clump clusters”, 15 %
“doubles” and 10 % “tadpoles”. About 30 % are
evolving spirals and 10 % ellipticals.
Another important observation is that in the
past galaxies were smaller than nowadays. Even
if the mass or luminosity of a galaxy were sim-
ilar to a modern galaxy its diameter at z = 3 is
only one tenth. The most probable explanation is
that the outer parts grow in several small mergers.
Collision of a dwarf galaxy does not considerably
increase the mass of the great galaxy but brings
more stars to its outskirts increasing its diameter.
The observation clearly indicates how important
mutual collisions have been in the evolution of
galaxies towards their current forms.
Evolution of AGN
The ﬁrst clear indication of
cosmic evolution was in the numbers of radio
galaxies and quasars. Already in the late 1960’s
it was becoming clear that the density of quasars
was increasing dramatically towards higher red-
shifts (Fig. 19.36). Roughly, the number density
of quasars increases relative to the present den-
sity by a factor 100 out to a broad maximum at
Fig. 19.36 Quasar activity at different redshifts accord-
ing to X-ray and infrared observations (gray areas and the
gray line). The black line corresponds to the stellar birth
rate in Fig. 19.37. (Madau ja Dickinson, 2014, Ann. Rev.
Astron. Astrophys. 52)

ferent symbols correspond to values obtained in different

redshift about 2. The observed behaviour may be
due to either density or luminosity evolution. The
density of radio galaxies also has a maximum
at redshifts about 1.5–3, which is sometimes re-
ferred to as the quasar era.
The Star Formation History of the Universe
Since the Universe contained only neutral gas as
the ﬁrst stars began to form, the most general de-
scription of how galaxies came to be is in terms
of the rate at which the gas is being turned into
stars. The star formation history going back to

420

a redshift about 8 is shown in Fig. 19.37. The star
formation rate was about an order of magnitude
larger than its current value at redshift 1–2. For
even larger redshifts it seems to have remained
nearly constant or decreased slowly.

Cosmology
Cosmology is a science studying the structure and
evolution of the whole Universe. Research in cos-
mology tries to answer questions such as: How
large and how old is the Universe? How was it
born? How is matter distributed? How were the
elements formed? What will be the future of the
Universe?
After the demise of the Aristotelian world pic-
ture, it took hundreds of years of astronomical ob-
servations and physical theories to reach a level at
which a satisfactory modern scientiﬁc picture of
the physical universe could be formed. The de-
cisive steps in the development were the clariﬁ-
cation of the nature of the galaxies in the 1920’s
and the general theory of relativity, which gives a
basis for theoretical research of the universe, de-
veloped by Einstein in the 1910’s. Yet, just a few
decades ago there was a lot of room for armwaiv-
ing and all kinds of speculations. Only recently
the observations made with satellites have given
reasonably precise values for some parameters
and some alternative models could be excluded.
The central tenet of modern cosmology is the
model of the expanding universe, getting all the
time more supporting observational evidence.
20.1
Cosmological Observations
The Olbers Paradox
The simplest cosmolog-
ical observation may be that the sky is dark at
night. This fact was ﬁrst noted by Johannes Ke-
pler, who, in 1610, used it as evidence for a ﬁnite
universe. As the idea of an inﬁnite space ﬁlled
with stars like the Sun became widespread in con-
sequence of the Copernican revolution, the ques-
tion of the dark night sky remained a problem. In
the 18th and 19th centuries Edmond Halley, Loys
de Chéseaux and Heinrich Olbers considered it in
their writings. It has become known as the Olbers
paradox (Fig. 20.1).
The paradox is the following: Let us suppose
the Universe is inﬁnite and that the stars are uni-
formly distributed in space. No matter in what di-
rection one looks, sooner or later the line of sight
will encounter the surface of a star. Since the sur-
face brightness does not depend on distance, each
point in the sky should appear to be as bright as
the surface of the Sun. This clearly is not true.
The modern explanation of the paradox is that the
stars have only existed for a ﬁnite time, so that the
light from very distant stars has not yet reached
us. Rather than proving the world to be ﬁnite in
space, the Olbers paradox has shown it to be of
a ﬁnite age.
Extragalactic Space
In 1923 Edwin Hubble
showed that the Andromeda Galaxy M31 was
far outside the Milky Way, thus settling a long-
standing controversy concerning the relationship
between the nebulae and the Milky Way. The
numerous galaxies seen in photographs form
an extragalactic space vastly larger than the di-
mensions of the Milky Way. It is important for
cosmology that the distribution and motions of
the basic components of extragalactic space, the
galaxies and clusters of galaxies, should every-
where be the same as in our local part of the

Cosmology
Fig. 20.1 The Olbers paradox. If the stars were uniformly
distributed in an unending, unchanging space, the sky
should be as bright as the surface of the Sun, since each
line of sight would eventually meet the surface of a star.

tunen)
Universe. Galaxies generally occur in various
systems, ranging from small groups to clusters
of galaxies and even larger superclusters. The
largest structures observed are about 100 Mpc in
size (see Sect. 19.6). They are thus signiﬁcantly
smaller than the volume of space ( a few thousand
Mpc in size) in which the distribution of galaxies
has been investigated. One way of studying the
large-scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribu-
tion is to count the number of galaxies brighter
than some limiting magnitude m. If the galax-
ies are uniformly distributed in space, this num-
ber should be proportional to 100.6m (see Exam-
ple 18.1). For example, the galaxy counts made
by Hubble in 1934, which included 44,000 galax-
ies, were consistent with a galaxy distribution in-
dependent of position (homogeneity) and of di-
rection (isotropy). Hubble found no “edge” of the
Universe, nor have later galaxy counts found one.
Similar counts have been made for extragalac-
tic radio sources. (Instead of magnitudes, ﬂux
densities are used. If F is the ﬂux density, then
because m = −2.5lg(F/F0), the number count
will be proportional to F −3/2.) These counts
mainly involve very distant radio galaxies and
quasars (Fig. 20.2). The results seem to indicate
that the radio sources were either much brighter
or much more common at earlier epochs than at
present (Sect. 19.8). This constitutes evidence in
favour of an evolving, expanding universe.
In general the simple geometric relation be-
tween brightness and number counts will only
hold for objects that are uniformly distributed in
space. Local inhomogeneities will cause depar-
tures from the expected relationship. For more
distant sources the geometry of the Universe as
well as cosmic evolution will change the basic
100.6m behaviour.
Hubble’s Law
(See Fig. 20.3.) In the late
1920’s, Hubble discovered that the spectral lines
of galaxies were shifted towards the red by an
amount proportional to their distances. If the red-
shift is due to the Doppler effect, this means that
the galaxies move away from each other with ve-
locities proportional to their separations, i.e. that
the Universe is expanding as a whole.
In terms of the redshift z = (λ −λ0)/λ0, Hub-
ble’s law can be written as
z = (H/c)r,
(20.1)
where c is the speed of light, H is the Hub-
ble constant and r the distance of the galaxy.
For small velocities (V ≪c) the Doppler redshift
z = V/c, and hence
V = Hr,
(20.2)
which is the most commonly used form of Hub-
ble’s law.
For a set of observed “standard candles”, i.e.
galaxies whose absolute magnitudes are close
to some mean M0, Hubble’s law corresponds to

a linear relationship between the apparent mag-
nitude m and the logarithm of the redshift, lgz.
This is because a galaxy at distance r has an ap-
parent magnitude m = M0 + 5lg(r/10 pc), and
hence Hubble’s law yields
m = M0 + 5lg

cz
H × 10 pc

= 5lgz + C,
(20.3)
where the constant C depends on H and M0.
Suitable standard candles are e.g. the brightest
galaxies in clusters and Sc galaxies of a known
luminosity class. Some other methods of dis-
tance determination for galaxies were discussed
in Sect. 19.2. Most recently, type Ia supernovae
(Sect. 14.4) in distant galaxies have been used to
determine distances out to the redshift z = 1.7,
where departures from Hubble’s law are already
detectable.
If the Universe is expanding, the galaxies were
once much nearer to each other. If the rate of ex-
pansion had been unchanging, the inverse of the
Hubble constant, T = H −1, would represent the
age of the Universe. If the expansion is gradually
slowing down, the inverse Hubble constant gives
an upper limit on the age of the Universe In fact,
current indications (discussed later in this chap-
ter) are that the rate of expansion is accelerating
at present. In that case the age of the Universe
may also be larger. However, H −1 will still be an
estimate for the age of the Universe.
One reason for the difﬁculty in determining
the value of the Hubble constant is the uncer-

al., 2013, ApJ 763, 35)
tainty in extragalactic distances. A second prob-
lem is that the measured values of the velocity V ,
corrected to take into account the motion of the
Sun within the Local Group, contain a signiﬁ-
cant component due to the peculiar motions of the
galaxies. These peculiar velocities are caused by
local mass concentrations like groups and clus-
ters of galaxies. It is possible that the Local Group
has a signiﬁcant velocity towards the centre of the
Local Supercluster (the Virgo Cluster). Because
the Virgo Cluster is often used to determine the
value of H, neglecting this peculiar velocity leads
to a large error in H. The size of the peculiar ve-
locity is not yet well known, but it is probably
about 250 km s−1.
The most ambitious recent project for deter-
mining H used the Hubble Space Telescope in
order to measure cepheid distances to a set of
nearby galaxies. These distances were then used
to calibrate other distance indicators, such as the
Tully–Fisher relation and type Ia supernovae. The
ﬁnal result was H = (72 ± 8) kms−1 Mpc−1.
The largest remaining source of error in this result
is the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud,
used for calibrating the cepheid luminosity.
Nowadays the most accurate value for the
Hubble constant is obtained by studying the
angular power spectrum of the background
radiation (Sect. 20.7). According to the mea-
Fig. 20.4 It is nowadays assumed that at the beginning
the expansion rate of the Universe was slowing down un-
til about 5 billion years ago the deceleration changed to
acceleration. The age of the Universe calculated from the
current value of the Hubble constant is bigger than the ac-
tual age
surements of the Planck satellite H = (67.7 ±
0.5) kms−1 Mpc−1 and the age of the Universe is
13.80 ± 0.02 Ga.
The form of Hubble’s law might give the im-
pression that the Milky Way is the centre of
the expansion, in apparent contradiction with the
Copernican principle. Figure 20.5 shows that, in
fact, the same Hubble’s law is valid at each point

20.1

law does not mean that the Milky Way (O) is the centre of
the Universe. Observers at any other galaxy (O′) will see

in a regularly expanding universe. There is no
particular centre of expansion.
The Thermal Microwave Background Radia-
tion
The most important cosmological discov-
ery since Hubble’s law was made in 1965. In that
year Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered
that there is a universal microwave radiation, with
a spectrum corresponding to that of blackbody ra-
diation (see Sect. 5.6) at a temperature of about
3 K (Fig. 20.7). For their discovery, they received
the Nobel prize in physics in 1979.
The existence of a thermal cosmic radiation
background had been predicted in the late 1940’s
by George Gamow, who was one of the ﬁrst
to study the initial phases of expansion of the
Universe. According to Gamow, the Universe at
that time was ﬁlled with extremely hot radia-
tion. As it expanded, the radiation cooled, until at
present, its temperature would be a few kelvins.
After its discovery by Penzias and Wilson, the
cosmic background radiation has been studied at
wavelengths from 50 cm to 0.5 cm. The ﬁrst de-
tailed measurements, made from the COBE (Cos-
mic Background Explorer) satellite showed that
it corresponds closely to a Planck spectrum at
(2.725 ± 0.002) K (Fig. 20.6). More recently the
CMB has been mapped in even greater detail by
the WMAP satellite.
The existence of the thermal cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) gives strong support
to the belief that the Universe was extremely hot
in its early stages. The background is very nearly
isotropic, which supports the isotropic and ho-
mogeneous models of the Universe. The COBE
Fig. 20.6 Observations of the cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation made by the COBE satellite in 1990 are
in agreement with a blackbody law at 2.7 K
and WMAP satellites have also detected temper-
ature variations of a relative amplitude 6 × 10−6
in the background. These ﬂuctuations are inter-
preted as a gravitational redshift of the back-
ground produced by the mass concentrations that
would later give rise to the observed structures
in the Universe. They are the direct traces of ini-
tial irregularities in the big bang, and provide im-
portant constraints for theories of galaxy forma-
tion. Perhaps even more importantly, the ampli-
tude of the ﬂuctuations on different angular scales
have provided crucial constraints on the cosmo-
logical model. We shall return to this question in
Sect. 20.7.
The Isotropy of Matter and Radiation
Apart
from the CMB, several other phenomena con-
ﬁrm the isotropy of the Universe. The distribu-
tion of radio sources, the X-ray background, and
faint distant galaxies, as well as Hubble’s law are
all isotropic. The observed isotropy is also evi-
dence that the Universe is homogeneous, since
a large-scale inhomogeneity would be seen as an
anisotropy.
The Age of the Universe
Estimates of the ages
of the Earth, the Sun and of star clusters are im-
portant cosmological observations that do not de-
pend on speciﬁc cosmological models. From the
decay of radioactive isotopes, the age of the Earth
is estimated to be 4600 million years. The age of
the Sun is thought to be slightly larger than this.

The ages of the oldest star clusters in the Milky
Way are 10–15 Ga.
The values thus obtained give a lower limit to
the age of the Universe. In an expanding universe,
the inverse Hubble constant gives another esti-
mate of that age. It is most remarkable that the
directly determined ages of cosmic objects are so
close to the age given by the Hubble constant.
This is strong evidence that Hubble’s law really
is due to the expansion of the Universe. It also
shows that the oldest star clusters formed very
early in the history of the Universe.
The Relative Helium Abundance
A cosmo-
logical theory should also give an acceptable ac-
count of the origin and abundances of the ele-
ments. Even the abundance of the elementary par-
ticles and the lack of antimatter are cosmological
problems that have begun to be investigated in the
context of theories of the early Universe.
Observations show that the oldest objects con-
tain about 25 % by mass of helium, the most
abundant element after hydrogen. The amount of
helium produced is sensitive to the temperature of
the Universe, which is related to that of the back-
ground radiation. The computations made for the
standard models of the expanding Universe (the
Friedmann models) yield a helium abundance of
exactly the right size.
20.2
The Cosmological Principle
One hopes that as ever larger volumes of the Uni-
verse are observed, its average properties will be-
come simple and well deﬁned. Figure 20.7 at-
tempts to show this. It shows a distribution of
galaxies on a plane. As the circle surrounding the
observer O becomes larger, the mean density in-
side the circle becomes practically independent
of its size. The same behaviour occurs, regardless
of the position of the centre of O: at close dis-
tances, the density varies randomly (Fig. 20.8),
but in a large enough volume, the average den-
sity is constant. This is an example of the cosmo-
logical principle: apart from local irregularities,
the Universe looks the same from all positions in
space.
The cosmological principle is a far-reaching
assumption, which has been invoked in order to
put constraints on the large variety of possible
cosmological theories. If in addition to the cos-
mological principle one also assumes that the
Universe is isotropic, then the only possible cos-
mic ﬂow is a global expansion. In that case, the
local velocity difference V between two nearby
points has to be directly proportional to their sep-
aration (V = Hr); i.e. Hubble’s law must apply.
The plane universe of Fig. 20.7 is homoge-
neous and isotropic, apart from local irregular-

ities. Isotropy at each point implies homogene-
ity, but homogeneity does not require isotropy.
An example of an anisotropic, homogeneous uni-
verse would be a model containing a constant
magnetic ﬁeld: because the ﬁeld has a ﬁxed di-
rection, space cannot be isotropic.
We have already seen that astronomical obser-
vations support the homogeneity and isotropy of
our observable neighbourhood, the metagalaxy.
On the grounds of the cosmological principle,
these properties may be extended to the whole of
the Universe.
The cosmological principle is closely related
to the Copernican principle that our position in
the Universe is in no way special. From this prin-
ciple, it is only a short step to assume that on
a large enough scale, the local properties of the
metagalaxy are the same as the global properties
of the Universe.
Homogeneity and isotropy are important sim-
plifying assumptions when trying to construct
cosmological models which can be compared
with local observations. They may therefore rea-
sonably be adopted, at least as a preliminary hy-
pothesis.

Homogeneous and Isotropic
Universes
Under general conditions, space and time coordi-
nates in a universe may be chosen so that the val-
ues of the space coordinates of observers moving
with the matter are constant. It can be shown that
in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, the line
element (Appendix B) then takes the form

known as the Robertson–Walker line element.
(The radial coordinate r is deﬁned to be dimen-
sionless.) R(t) is a time-dependent quantity rep-
resenting the scale of the Universe. If R increases

Fig. 20.9 The two-dimensional analogues of the Fried-
mann models: a spherical surface, a plane and a saddle
surface
with time, all distances, including those between
galaxies, will grow. The coefﬁcient k may be
+1, 0 or −1, corresponding to the three possi-
ble geometries of space, the elliptic or closed, the
parabolic and the hyperbolic or open model.
The space described by these models need not
be Euclidean, but can have positive or negative
curvature. Depending on the curvature, the vol-
ume of the universe may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. In
neither case does it have a visible edge.
The two-dimensional analogy to elliptical
(k = +1) geometry is the surface of a sphere
(Fig. 20.9): its surface area is ﬁnite, but has no
edge. The scale factor R(t) represents the size of
the sphere. When R changes, the distances be-
tween points on the surface change in the same
way. Similarly, a three-dimensional “spherical
surface”, or the space of elliptical geometry, has
a ﬁnite volume, but no edge. Starting off in an
arbitrary direction and going on for long enough,
one always returns to the initial point (unless the
distance is increased too much by the expansion).
When k = 0, space is ﬂat or Euclidean, and the
expression for the line element (20.4) is almost
the same as in the Minkowski space. The only
difference is the scale factor R(t). All distances
in a Euclidean space change with time. The two-
dimensional analogue of this space is a plane.
The volume of space in the hyperbolic geom-
etry (k = −1) is also inﬁnite. A two-dimensional
idea of the geometry in this case is given by a sad-
dle surface or a horn becoming inﬁnitely wider.
In a homogeneous and isotropic universe,
many physical quantities will depend on time
through the scale factor R(t). For example, from
the form of the line element, it is evident that all
distances will be proportional to R (Fig. 20.10).
Fig. 20.10 When space expands, all galaxy separations
grow with the scale factor R: r′ = [R(t′
0)/R(t0)]r
Thus, if the distance to a galaxy is r at time t, then
at time t0 (in cosmology, the subscript 0 refers to
the present value) it will be
R(t0)
R(t) r.
(20.5)
Similarly, all volumes will be proportional to R3.
From this it follows that the density of any con-
served quantity (e.g. mass) will behave as R−3.
It can be shown that the wavelength of ra-
diation in an expanding universe is proportional
to R, like all other lengths. If the wavelength at
the time of emission, corresponding to the scale
factor R, is λ, then it will be λ0 when the scale
factor has increased to R0:
λ0
λ = R0
R .
(20.6)
The redshift is z = (λ0 −λ)/λ, and hence
1 + z = R0
R ;
(20.7)
i.e. the redshift of a galaxy expresses how much
the scale factor has changed since the light was
emitted. For example, the light from a quasar
with z = 1 was emitted at a time when all dis-
tances were half their present values.
For small values of the redshift, (20.7) ap-
proaches the usual form of Hubble’s law. This can
be seen as follows. When z is small, the change
in R during the propagation of a light signal will
also be small and proportional to the light travel
time t. Because t = r/c approximately, where r
is the distance of the source, the redshift will be

20.4
The Friedmann Models
429
proportional to r. If the constant of proportional-
ity is denoted by H/c, one has
z = Hr/c.
(20.8)
This is formally identical to Hubble’s law (20.1).
However, the redshift is now interpreted in the
sense of (20.7).
As the universe expands, the photons in the
background radiation will also be redshifted. The
energy of each photon is inversely proportional to
its wavelength, and will therefore behave as R−1.
It can be shown that the number of photons will
be conserved, and thus their number density will
behave as R−3. Combining these two results, one
ﬁnds that the energy density of the background
radiation is proportional to R−4. The energy den-
sity of blackbody radiation is proportional to T 4,
where T is the temperature. Thus the temperature
of cosmic background radiation will vary as R−1.
20.4
The Friedmann Models
The results of the preceding section are valid in
any homogeneous and isotropic universe. In order
to determine the precise time-dependence of the
scale factor R(t) a theory of gravity is required.
In 1917 Albert Einstein presented a model
of the Universe based on his general theory of
relativity. It described a geometrically symmet-
ric (spherical) space with ﬁnite volume but no
boundary. In accordance with the cosmologi-
cal principle, the model was homogeneous and
isotropic. It was also static: the volume of space
did not change.
In order to obtain a static model, Einstein had
to introduce a new repulsive force, the cosmo-
logical term, in his equations. The size of this
cosmological term is given by the cosmological
constant Λ. Einstein presented his model before
the redshifts of the galaxies were known, and tak-
ing the Universe to be static was then reasonable.
When the expansion of the Universe was discov-
ered, this argument in favour of the cosmological
constant vanished. Einstein himself later called it
the biggest blunder of his life. Nevertheless, the
most recent observations now seem to indicate
that a non-zero cosmological constant has to be
present.
The St. Petersburg physicist Alexander Fried-
mann and later, independently, the Belgian Geor-
ges Lemaître studied the cosmological solutions
of Einstein’s equations. If Λ = 0, only evolving,
expanding or contracting models of the Universe
are possible. From the Friedmann models exact
formulas for the redshift and Hubble’s law may
be derived.
The general relativistic derivation of the law of
expansion for the Friedmann models will not be
given here. It is interesting that the existence of
three types of models and their law of expansion
can be derived from purely Newtonian consider-
ations, with results in complete agreement with
the relativistic treatment. The detailed derivation
is given on Box 20.1, but the essential character
of the motion can be obtained from a simple en-
ergy argument.
Let us consider a small expanding spherical re-
gion in the Universe. In a spherical distribution of
matter, the gravitational force on a given spher-
ical shell depends only on the mass inside that
shell. We shall here assume Λ = 0.
We can now consider the motion of a galaxy
of mass m at the edge of our spherical region.
According to Hubble’s law, its velocity will be
V = Hr and the corresponding kinetic energy,
T = mV 2/2.
(20.9)
The potential energy at the edge of a sphere of
mass M is U = −GMm/r. Thus the total energy
is
E = T + U = mV 2/2 −GMm/r,
(20.10)
which has to be constant. If the mean density of
the Universe is ρ, the mass is M = (4πr3/3)ρ.
The value of ρ corresponding to E = 0 is called
the critical density, ρc. We have

whence
ρc = 3H 2
8πG.
(20.12)
The expansion of the Universe can be com-
pared to the motion of a mass launched vertically
from the surface of a celestial body. The form of
the orbit depends on the initial energy. In order
to compute the complete orbit, the mass M of
the main body and the initial velocity have to be
known. In cosmology, the corresponding param-
eters are the mean density and the Hubble con-
stant.
The E = 0 model corresponds to the Eu-
clidean Friedmann model, the Einstein–de Sitter
model. If the density exceeds the critical density,
the expansion of any spherical region will turn
to a contraction and it will collapse to a point.
This corresponds to the closed Friedmann model.
Finally, if ρ < ρc, the ever expanding hyperbolic
model is obtained. The behaviour of the scale fac-
tor in these three cases is shown in Fig. 20.11.
These three models of the universe are called
the standard models. They are the simplest rel-
ativistic cosmological models for Λ = 0. Mod-
els with Λ ̸= 0 are mathematically more compli-
cated, but show the same general behaviour.
The simple Newtonian treatment of the expan-
sion problem is possible because Newtonian me-
chanics is approximately valid in small regions
of the Universe. However, although the resulting
equations are formally similar, the interpretation

of the quantities involved (e.g. the parameter k)
is not the same as in the relativistic context. The
global geometry of the Friedmann models can
only be understood within the general theory of
relativity.
Consider two points at a separation r at the
time t. Let their relative velocity be V . If the dis-
tance at t0 is r0 then
r = R(t)
R(t0) r0
and
V = ˙r =
˙R(t)
R(t0) r0,
(20.13)
and thus the Hubble constant is
H = V
r =

R(t).
(20.14)
The deceleration of the expansion is described
by the deceleration parameter q, deﬁned as
q = −R ¨R/ ˙R2.
(20.15)
The deceleration parameter describes the change
of the rate of the expansion ˙R. The additional fac-
tors have been included in order to make it dimen-
sionless, i.e. independent of the choice of units of
length and time.
The value of the deceleration parameter can
be expressed in terms of the Hubble constant and
density. Substitute the deﬁnition of H and the ex-
pression of ¨R (from Box 20.1) to the deﬁnition
of q. We get
q = 4πG

ρ0R3

R3H 2 .
(20.16)
The density is usually expressed in terms of the
density parameter Ω deﬁned as Ω = ρ/ρc, so
that Ω = 1 corresponds to the Einstein–de Sitter
model. Thus
Ω = 8πG
3
ρ0R3

(20.17)
Hence there is a simple relation between Ω
and q:
Ω = 2q.

The value q = 1/2 of the deceleration parameter
corresponds to the critical density Ω = 1. Both
quantities are in common use in cosmology. It

20.5

should be noted that the density and the decelera-
tion can be observed independently. The validity
of (20.18) is thus a test for the correctness of gen-
eral relativity with Λ = 0.
20.5
Cosmological Tests
A central cosmological problem is the question of
which Friedmann model best represents the real
Universe. Different models make different obser-
vational predictions. Recently there has been con-
siderable progress in the determination of the cos-
mological parameters, and for the ﬁrst time there
is now a set of parameters that appear capable
of accounting for all observations. In the follow-
ing, some possible tests will be considered. These
tests are related to the average properties of the
Universe. Further cosmological constraints can
be obtained from the observed structures. These
will be discussed in Sect. 20.7.
The Critical Density
If the average density ρ
is larger than the critical density ρc, the Uni-
verse is closed. For the Hubble constant H =
100 kms−1 Mpc−1, the value of ρc = 1.9 ×
10−26 kgm−3, corresponding to roughly ten hy-
drogen atoms per cubic metre. Mass determina-
tions for individual galaxies lead to smaller val-
ues for the density, favouring an open model.
However, the density determined in this way
is a lower limit, since there may be signiﬁcant
amounts of invisible mass outside the main parts
of the galaxies.
If most of the mass of clusters of galaxies
is dark and invisible, it will increase the mean
density nearer the critical value. Using the virial
masses of X-ray clusters of galaxies (Sect. 19.2),
one ﬁnds Ω0 = 0.3. Considerations of the ob-
served velocities of clusters of galaxies indicate
that the relative amount of dark matter does not
increase further on even larger scales.
Neutrinos have a small mass (about 10−4 elec-
tron mass). A large neutrino background should
have been produced in the big bang. In spite of
the small suggested mass of the neutrinos, they
can still form a part of the mass of the Universe.
Nowadays it is known that the mass of the neu-
trino is too small to explain the dark matter prob-
lem. Also, they move at relativistic speeds and are
too “hot” to form the observed structures. Instead
much recent work in cosmology has been based
on the hypothesis of Cold Dark Matter (CDM),
i.e. the idea that a signiﬁcant part of the mass of
the Universe is in the form of non-relativistic par-
ticles of an unknown kind.
It is understood that the mean density of the
University cannot be reliably determined from
the observations of the current constituents of the
Universe. Instead, a very precise value for the
mean density is found by studying the details of
the cosmic background radiation, since that gives
a single picture of the contents of the whole Uni-
verse. The measurements show that the density is
exactly the critical density, which means that the
space is ﬂat. The most recent result of Planck ob-
tained in 2015 gives a curvature of 0.001±0.004,
meaning that the deviation from zero is at most
0.5 %.
The Magnitude-Redshift Test
Although for
small redshifts, all models predict the Hubble re-
lationship m = 5lgz+C for standard candles, for
larger redshifts there are differences, depending
on the deceleration parameter q. This provides
a way of measuring q.
The models predict that galaxies at a given
redshift look brighter in the closed models than
in the open ones (see Fig. 20.4). Measurements
of type Ia supernovae out to redshifts z = 1.7 us-
ing the Hubble Space Telescope have now shown
that the observed q is inconsistent with models
having Λ = 0. Assuming Ω0 = 0.3 these obser-
vations require ΩΛ = 0.7, where ΩΛ is deﬁned
below in Box 20.1.
The Angular Diameter-Redshift Test
Along
with the magnitude-redshift test, the relation be-
tween angular diameter and redshift has been
used as a cosmological test. Let us ﬁrst consider
how the angular diameter θ of a standard object
varies with distance in static models with differ-
ent geometries. In a Euclidean geometry, the an-
gular diameter is inversely proportional to the dis-
tance. In an elliptical geometry, θ decreases more
slowly with distance, and even begins to increase
beyond a certain point. The reason for this can be
understood by thinking of the surface of a sphere.

432
20
Cosmology
For an observer at the pole, the angular diameter
is the angle between two meridians marking the
edges of his standard object. This angle is small-
est when the object is at the equator, and grows
towards the opposite pole. In a hyperbolic geom-
etry, the angle θ decreases more rapidly with dis-
tance than in the Euclidean case.
In an expanding closed universe the angular
diameter should begin to increase at a redshift
of about one. This effect has been looked for in
the diameters of radio galaxies and quasars. No
turnover has been observed, but this may also be
due to evolution of the radio sources or to the
selection of the observational data. At smaller
redshifts, the use of the diameters of clusters of
galaxies has yielded equally inconclusive results.
Evolutionary effects are the most important
factors for the uncertainty. We know that the
sizes of large scale structures are changing while
the Universe is evolving. The evolution of the
structures has been investigated using cosmo-
logical simulations (e.g. Millennium, Illustris
Fig. 20.14). The simulations give estimates for
the object sizes at different redshift, and these val-
ues can be compared with the actual observations.
The results are consistent with the cosmological
ΛCDM concordance model.
Basically the same idea can be applied to the
angular scale of the strongest ﬂuctuation in the
cosmic microwave background. The linear size
of these depends only weakly on the cosmolog-
ical model and can therefore be treated as a stan-
dard measuring rod. Their redshift is determined
by the decoupling of matter and radiation (see
Sect. 20.6). Observations of their angular size
have provided strong evidence that Ω0 +ΩΛ = 1,
i.e. the Universe is ﬂat.
Primordial Nucleosynthesis
The standard mo-
del predicts that 25 % of the mass of the Universe
turned into helium in the “big bang”. This amount
is not sensitive to the density and thus does not
provide a strong cosmological test. However, the
amount of deuterium left over from helium syn-
thesis does depend strongly on the density. Al-
most all deuterons formed in the big bang unite
into helium nuclei. For a larger density the colli-
sions destroying deuterium were more frequent.
Thus a small present deuterium abundance indi-
cates a high cosmological density. Similar argu-
ments apply to the amounts of 3He and 7Li pro-
duced in the big bang. The interpretation of the
observed abundances is difﬁcult, since they have
been changed by later nuclear processes. Still,
present results for the abundances of these nuclei
are consistent with each other and with a den-
sity corresponding to Ω0 about 0.04. Note that
this number only refers to the mass in the form
of baryons, i.e. protons and neutrons. Since the
virial masses of clusters of galaxies indicate that
Ω0 is about 0.3, this has stimulated models such
as the CDM model, where most of the mass is not
in the form of normal baryons.
Ages
The ages of different Friedmann models
can be compared with known ages of various
systems. The age t0 of a Friedmann model with
given Ω0 and ΩΛ is obtained by integrating equa-
tion (8) of Box 20.1. This gives
t0 = H −1
0
 1
0
da

Ω0a−1 + ΩΛa2 + 1
−Ω0 −ΩΛ
−1/2.
(20.19)
This age is required to be larger than the ages of
the oldest known astronomical objects.
If the density is critical and Λ = 0, t0H0 =
2/3. Thus if H0 = 75 kms−1 Mpc−1, the age is
t0 = 9 Ga. Larger values of Ω0 give smaller ages,
whereas positive values of Λ lead to larger ages.
It has been a source of embarrassment that the
best values of H have tended to give an age for
the Universe only marginally consistent with the
ages of the oldest astronomical objects. With the
introduction of a positive cosmological constant
and a slight downward revision of stellar ages this
problem has disappeared. In 2003 the WMAP re-
sults gave an age of 13.7 Ga. A more recent value
by the Planck satellite is 13.80 ± 0.02 Ga.
The best current parameter values give 13–
14 Ga for the age of the Universe.
The “Concordance” Model
In summary there
has been a remarkable recent convergence be-
tween different cosmological tests. The resulting
model has a positive cosmological constant, and

20.6
History of the Universe
433
most of the matter is cold and dark. It is thus re-
ferred to as the ΛCDM model. The best parame-
ter values are H = 70 kms−1 Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.7,
Ω0 = 0.3, with cold dark matter making up 85 %
of the total density.
The concordance model is by no means deﬁni-
tive. In particular the reason for the cosmological
constant is a major puzzle. In order to allow for
the possibility that Λ is variable it has become
customary to refer to it as dark energy, saving the
term cosmological constant for the case of a con-
stant Λ. Even if some alternative mechanism can
produce the same effect as a non-zero Λ, ﬁnding
at least one set of acceptable parameters, thanks
to the WMAP and Planck satellites, is an impor-
tant step forward.
An additional set of constraints on the cosmo-
logical model comes from the large-scale struc-
tures of the Universe. These constraints, which
contribute further support for the concordance
model, will be considered in Sect. 20.7.
20.6
History of the Universe
We have seen how the density of matter and of ra-
diation energy and temperature can be computed
as functions of the scale factor R. Since the scale
factor is known as a function of time, it is possi-
ble to calculate how these quantities change with
time.
When we back in time R is decreasing. Since
ρ ∝R−3, T ∝R−1, densities and temperatures
at the beginning were so immense that all theo-
ries about the physical processes taking place are
highly conjectural. Nevertheless attempts have
been made at understanding the most fundamen-
tal properties of the Universe on the basis of
modern theories of particle physics. For example,
no indications of signiﬁcant amounts of antimat-
ter in the Universe have been discovered. Thus,
for some reason, the number of matter particles
must have exceeded that of antimatter particles by
a factor of 1.000000001. Because of this symme-
try breaking, when 99.9999999 % of the hadrons
were annihilated, 10−7 % was left later to form
galaxies and everything else. It has been specu-
lated that the broken symmetry originated in par-
ticle processes about 10−35 s after the initial time.
Fig. 20.12 The energy densities of matter and radiation
decrease as the Universe expands. Nucleon–antinucleon
pairs annihilate at 10−4 s; electron–positron pairs at 1 s
The breaking of fundamental symmetries in
the early Universe may lead to what is known as
inﬂation of the Universe. In consequence of sym-
metry breaking, the dominant energy density may
be the zero-point energy of a quantum ﬁeld. This
energy density will lead to inﬂation, a strongly
accelerated expansion, which will dilute irregu-
larities and drive the density very close to the
critical value. One may thus understand how the
present homogeneity, isotropy and ﬂatness of the
Universe have come about. In the inﬂationary
picture the Universe has to be very nearly ﬂat,
Ω0 +ΩΛ = 1. The inﬂationary models also make
speciﬁc predictions for the form of the irregulari-
ties in the CMB. These predictions are in general
agreement with what has been observed.
As the Universe expanded, the density and
temperature decreased (Fig. 20.12) and condi-
tions became such that known physical princi-
ples can be applied. During the hot early stages,
photons and massive particles were continually
changing into each other: high-energy photons
collided to produce particle-antiparticle pairs,
which then were annihilated and produced pho-
tons. As the Universe cooled, the photon ener-
gies became too small to maintain this equilib-
rium. There is a threshold temperature below
which particles of a given type are no longer
produced. For example, the threshold tempera-
ture for hadrons (protons, neutrons and mesons)
is T = 1012 K, reached at the time t = 10−4 s.
Thus the present building blocks of the atomic
nuclei, protons and neutrons, are relics from the
time 10−8–10−4 s, known as the hadron era.

434
20
Cosmology
Even before the hadron era, when the age of
the Universe was about 10−12 s, the dark mat-
ter particles forming about 5/6 of all matter were
born. They were decoupled from radiation around
10−9 s and started to form structures to which the
ordinary matter started to condense hundred mil-
lion years later.
The Lepton Era
In the time period 10−4–1 s,
the lepton era, the photon energies were large
enough to produce light particles, such as elec-
tron–positron pairs. Because of matter-antimatter
symmetry breaking, some of the electrons were
left over to produce present astronomical bodies.
During the lepton era neutrino decoupling took
place. Previously the neutrinos had been kept
in equilibrium with other particles by fast par-
ticle reactions. As the density and temperature
decreased, so did the reaction rates, and ﬁnally
they could no longer keep the neutrinos in equi-
librium. The neutrinos decoupled from other mat-
ter and were left to propagate through space with-
out any appreciable interactions. It has been cal-
culated that there are at present 600 such cosmo-
logical neutrinos per cubic centimetre, but their
negligible interactions make them extremely dif-
ﬁcult to observe. After the neutrino decoupling
the amount of free neutrons kept decreasing as
they decayed to protons and electrons.
The Radiation Era
After the end of the lep-
ton era, about 1 s after the initial time, the most
important form of energy was electromagnetic ra-
diation. This stage is called the radiation era. At
its beginning the temperature was about 1010 K
and at its end, about one million years later, when
the radiation energy density had dropped to that
of the particles, it had fallen to about 40,000 de-
grees. At the very beginning of the radiation era
within a few hundred seconds helium was pro-
duced.
Just before the epoch of helium synthesis, the
number ratio of free protons and neutrons was
changing because of the decay of the free neu-
trons. After about 100 s the temperature had
dropped to about 109 K, which is low enough
for deuterons to be formed. All remaining neu-
trons were then incorporated in deuterons; these,
in turn, were almost entirely consumed to pro-
duce helium nuclei. Thus the amount of helium
synthesised was determined by the number ratio
of protons and neutrons at the time of deuterium
production t = 100 s. Calculations show that this
ratio was about 14 : 2. Thus, out of 16 nucleons,
2 protons and 2 neutrons were incorporated in
a helium nucleus. Consequently 4/16 = 25 % of
the mass turned into helium. This is remarkably
close to the measured primordial helium abun-
dance.
Only the isotopes 2H, 3He, 4He and 7Li were
produced in appreciable numbers by nuclear pro-
cesses in the big bang. The heavier elements have
formed later in stellar interiors, in supernova ex-
plosions and perhaps in energetic events in galac-
tic nuclei.
Radiation Decoupling. The Matter Era
As
we have seen, the mass density of radiation (ob-
tained from the formula E = mc2) behaves as
R−4, whereas that of ordinary matter behaves as
R−3. Thus the radiation mass density decreases
more rapidly. At the end of the radiation era it
became smaller than the ordinary mass density.
The matter era began, bringing with it the for-
mation of galaxies, stars, planets and human life.
At present, the mass density of radiation is much
smaller than that of matter. Therefore the dynam-
ics of the Universe is completely determined by
the density of massive particles.
Soon after the end of the radiation era, radia-
tion decoupled from matter. This happened when
the temperature had dropped to a few thousand
degrees, and the protons and electrons combined
to form hydrogen atoms. It was the beginning of
the “dark ages” at redshifts z = 1000–100, be-
fore stars and galaxies had formed, when the Uni-
verse only contained dark matter, blackbody radi-
ation, and slowly cooling neutral gas.
At present, light can propagate freely through
space. The world is transparent to radiation: the
light from distant galaxies is weakened only by
the r−2 law and by the redshift. Since there is
no certain detection of absorption by neutral gas,
there must have been a reionisation of the Uni-
verse. It is thought that this occurred around z =
5–10.

The Formation of Structure
As we go backward in time from the present, the
distances between galaxies and clusters of galax-
ies become smaller. For example, the typical sep-
aration between galaxies is 100 times their di-
ameter. At the redshift z = 101 (R(now)/R(t) =
100) most galaxies must have been practically in
contact. For this reason galaxies in their present
form cannot have existed much earlier than about
z = 100. Since the stars were presumably formed
after the galaxies, all present astronomical sys-
tems must have formed later than this.
It is thought that all observed structures in the
Universe have arisen by the gravitational collapse
of small overdensities. Whereas the presently ob-
servable galaxies have undergone considerable
evolution, which makes it difﬁcult to deduce their
initial state, on larger scales the density variations
should still be small and easier to study. These
are the structures considered in the present sec-
tion. The later evolution of galaxies is discussed
in Sect. 19.8, and the formation of the Milky Way
in Sect. 18.5.
The Statistical Description of Large-Scale
Structure
The departures from strict homo-
geneity in the Universe are random in charac-
ter, and must therefore be described using statis-
tical methods. Perhaps the most straightforward
way of doing this is to take regions of a given
size, speciﬁed in terms of their mass, and give the
probability distribution for relative density varia-
tions on that scale.
A second method is to consider the spatial
separations between individual objects such as
galaxies or clusters. The distribution of these sep-
arations is used to deﬁne the correlation function,
which is a measure of the clustering of the objects
in question.
A third method to describe large-scale ﬂuctu-
ations is by means of the power spectrum. Here
the density variations (in space or in projection
on the sky) are represented as sum of waves. The
power spectrum is the squared amplitude of these
waves as a function of wavelength.
All three methods are representations of the
density variations in the Universe, and they are
Fig. 20.13 The motion of the Milky Way in relation to
the microwave background can be seen in the measure-
ments of WMAP. One side of the sky is darker (colder),
and the other side is lighter (warmer). The horizontal
stripe is the densest part of the Milky Way. (Photo NASA)
theoretically closely related. However, in practice
they are observed in different ways, and there-
fore, which representation is most suitable de-
pends on what kind of observations are being
analysed. The density variations are usually de-
scribed by means of a spectral index n and an
amplitude σ8 to be introduced below.
The Growth of Perturbations
In order to de-
scribe the growth of structures in the Universe,
consider a given region containing the mass M.
If its density is slightly larger than the mean den-
sity, its expansion will be slightly slower than that
of the rest of the Universe, and its relative over-
density will grow. The rate of growth as a func-
tion of mass depends on the relative importance
of the material components of the Universe, dark
matter, radiation, and ordinary baryonic matter.
It is assumed that there is an initial distribu-
tion of perturbations where the ﬂuctuations with
mass M have an amplitude that is proportional
to M−(n+3)/6. The spectral index n is a cosmo-
logical parameter to be determined from observa-
tions.
The ﬁrst step in structure formation is when
a given mass comes within the horizon, i.e. when
there has been enough time since the big bang
for light signals to cross the given region. During
the radiation era the horizon mass grows propor-
tionally to t3/2, and thus the time at which the
mass M comes within the horizon will be propor-
tional to M2/3. Any perturbation will initially be
larger than the horizon mass, and while this is the
case it grows in proportion to t. Once a matter

436
20
Cosmology
perturbation comes inside the horizon its ampli-
tude will remain constant. This constant ampli-
tude will behave as tM−(n+3)/6, which is propor-
tional to M−(n−1)/6. If n = 1, the perturbations
enter the horizon with an amplitude that is inde-
pendent of mass. We shall see that the observed
value of n is in fact very close to 1.
Perturbations of both dark and baryonic mat-
ter density will behave as described above during
the radiation era. At the end of the radiation era at
time tEQ, when the mass densities of radiation and
(non-relativistic) matter become equal, the ampli-
tude of the perturbations will be given by the hori-
zon mass MEQ ≈1016 M⊙for M ≪MEQ, and
will be proportional to M−(n+3)/6 for M ≫MEQ.
After equality the dark matter perturbations will
be free to start growing again as t2/3, independent
of mass.
Unlike dark matter, ordinary baryonic matter
perturbations cannot grow as long as the Universe
remains ionised. Instead there is a minimum mass
of a collapsing gas cloud given by the Jeans mass
MJ:
MJ ≈
P 3/2
G3/2ρ2 ,
(20.20)
where ρ and P are the density and pressure in the
cloud (see Sect. 6.11). The value of MJ before
decoupling was
MJ = 1018 M⊙
(20.21)
and after decoupling
MJ = 105 M⊙.
(20.22)
The reason for the large difference is that before
decoupling, matter feels the large radiation pres-
sure (P = u/3, see Box 11.1). After decoupling,
this pressure no longer affects the gas.
The large Jeans mass before decoupling means
that overdense regions of normal gas cannot start
growing before z = 1000. Rather than growing
they oscillate like sound waves. After decoupling
a large range of masses become Jeans unsta-
ble. By then density perturbations of dark matter
have had time to grow, and the gas will therefore
rapidly fall into their potential wells. The ﬁrst
stars will start forming in the collapsing regions,
and will reionise the Universe.
Fig. 20.14 Cosmological
simulations are used to
study the evolution of the
structures of the Universe.
The international Illustris
simulation shows how the
network of dark matter
evolves from redshift z = 4
(bottom frame) to z = 0
(topmost frame). (Illustris
Collaboration, www.
illustris-project.org)
Because the expansion of the Universe works
against the collapse, the density of Jeans unstable
regions grows rather slowly. In order to produce
the observed systems, the density perturbations at
decoupling cannot be too small. In models with-
out dark matter the variations in the CMB pre-
dicted on this basis tended to be too large. In the
CDM model the predicted variations are of the
expected amplitude.
In the CDM model the amplitude of ﬂuc-
tuations on scales about MEQ and smaller de-
pends only weakly on mass. This is why the
CDM model leads to an hierarchical description
of structure formation. In this picture, systems of
all masses above 105 M⊙begin forming after de-
coupling. Because smaller systems will collapse

20.7
The Formation of Structure
437
more rapidly, they are the ﬁrst to form, at redshifts
about 20. Once the ﬁrst sources of light, starbursts
or AGNs, had formed, they could reionise the gas.
This marked the ending of the dark ages at red-
shifts z = 10–5.
The redshift of reionisation is still not well
known, and is therefore treated as a parameter to
be determined in tests based on large-scale struc-
tures. It is usually expressed by means of τ, the
optical depth to electron scattering of the back-
ground radiation. A larger value of τ corresponds
to a higher electron density, implying reionisation
at a higher redshift. Since galaxies can be seen at
redshifts larger than 6, the corresponding value of
τ = 0.03 represents a minimum. The ﬁnal results
(2012) of the observations with WMAP gave τ =
0.081 ± 0.012, which would have corresponded
to a redshift 10.1 ± 1.0. The ﬁnal results (2015)
of Planck the gave 8.8 ± 0.1 as the mean redshift
of reionisation.
One ﬁnally has to ask where the initial pertur-
bations came from. An attractive feature of the
inﬂationary model is that it makes speciﬁc pre-
dictions for these initial perturbations, deriving
them from quantum effects at very early times.
In this way the observed properties of the largest
astronomical systems contain information about
the earliest stages of our Universe.
Fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Back-
ground
One important way of studying the
large-scale structure of the early Universe is by
means of the irregularities of the cosmic mi-
crowave background. The overdensities that were
later to give rise to observed structures should
also give rise to temperature variations of the
CMB.
The temperature variations in the microwave
background have been mapped, ﬁrst by the COBE
satellite, then by WMAP (Fig. 20.13) and Planck.
A map of the CMB according to Planck is shown
in Fig. 20.15. The observed variations are in qual-
itative agreement with the scenario for structure
formation described above.
A more quantitative view of the observations
is provided by the power spectrum of the obser-
vations shown in Fig. 20.16. This shows the am-
plitude of the temperature variations as a function
of angular scale on the sky.
Fig. 20.15 Temperature distribution of the background
radiation according to the measurements of the Planck
satellite. Dark areas are colder, light areas warmer and
more dense. (Planck Collaboration)
The physical processes we have described give
rise to the features in the power spectrum. Thus
the ﬁrst peak is produced by perturbations that
have just had time to collapse to a maximum den-
sity since equality of matter and radiation, be-
fore bouncing back. The linear size of this peak
does not depend strongly on the exact parame-
ters of the model, and its position (angular scale)
can therefore be used as a standard measuring rod
in the diameter—redshift test. The second and
third peaks in the power spectrum, the “acous-
tic peaks”, correspond to perturbations that have
bounced back and collapsed again, respectively.
The positions and amplitudes of these features
in the power spectrum depend on the cosmolog-
ical parameters. Thus the WMAP observations
of the CMB can be ﬁtted using a model con-
taining six free parameters: the Hubble constant,
the densities of dark matter and baryons, the op-
tical depth τ, and the amplitude σ8 and shape
n of the initial perturbations. The curvature of
the Universe, 1 −Ω0 −ΩΛ can be set equal to
zero, which determines the value of ΩΛ. The re-
sults of WMAP and Planck have given values for
these parameters in full agreement with the con-
cordance model.
Very Large Scale Structure
After decoupling
structures on different scales are free to grow. The
important dividing line is whether a given over-
density is still expanding with the rest of the Uni-
verse or whether it has had time to recollapse.
Systems that have recollapsed will fairly rapidly

virialise, i.e. settle down into a stationary state.
Such systems can be considered real astronomi-
cal systems.
The largest astronomical systems are clusters
of galaxies. For some time there was controversy
about whether even larger structures, superclus-
ters, existed. The controversy was settled in the
1970’s when it was realised that this largely de-
pended on what was meant by superclusters. Re-
gions of higher density existed on scales larger
than clusters of galaxies (a few Mpc), all the way
up to 100 Mpc, but they did not really form indi-
vidual structures in approximate equilibrium like
the clusters of galaxies.
Between these two alternatives are structures
that are only now turning round and beginning to
recollapse. One way of specifying the amplitude
of the initial ﬂuctuations is to give the scale of this
transition point. This scale corresponds roughly
to a present linear size of 8 Mpc, and for this rea-
son the ﬂuctuation amplitude is commonly given
by means of σ8, the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations
at present scale 8 Mpc. Because of the way it has
been chosen σ8 should be close to 1.
Smaller systems will already have collapsed.
There are many ways of statistically describing
their large-scale distribution. One of the most
studied descriptors of clustering is the corre-
lation function, ξ(r). Consider two inﬁnitesi-
mal volumes dV1 and dV2 separated by the dis-
tance r. If there were no clustering, the proba-
bility of ﬁnding galaxies in these volumes would
be N2 dV1 dV2, where N is the number density
of galaxies. Because of clustering this probability
is actually N2(1 + ξ(r))dV1 dV2. The correlation
function thus measures the higher probability of
ﬁnding galaxies near each other.
Although there are ways of estimating the cor-
relation function from the distribution on the sky,
a more reliable estimate can be made by mapping
the distribution of galaxies in three dimensions,
using redshifts to determine their distances. The
distribution from one such survey (SDSS, Sloan
Digital Sky Survey) is shown in Fig. 20.17.
As expected, the general form of the correla-
tion function is a power law (close pairs are abun-
dant, distant pairs rarer). It has been known since
the 1970’s that the correlation function is approx-
imately proportional to rγ . The constant of pro-
portionality is related to the amplitude σ8 and the
exponent γ is related to the index n of the initial
perturbations. The observed value of γ is about
1.8, depending to some extent on the sample of
objects studied.
At large separations the curve shows an un-
expected maximum, observed for the ﬁrst time
in 2005. This is the same highest acoustic peak
seen in the angular power spectrum of Planck.
The observation conﬁrms the ΛCDM cosmology
and shows that the acoustic waves born around
z = 1000 have remained till the present time and
are seen in the distribution of galaxies. The same
peak has been seen later in the larger SDSS sur-
vey.

found “bump” in more detail. The value of h is the Hubble
constant divided by 100, or about 0.7. Thus a difference
100h−1 corresponds to a distance of about 150 Mpc (about
6 degrees on the sky). The bump tells about acoustic os-
cillations of baryons, i.e. large scale acoustic waves of the
visible matter. (Eisenstein et al., 2005, ApJ 633, 560)
In order to determine the cosmological param-
eters the (three-dimensional) power spectrum of
the galaxy distribution is usually used. It is then
compared to theoretical power spectra that de-
pend on the parameters in order to ﬁnd the best-
ﬁtting model. The optical depth parameter τ does
not affect these tests. The results have been com-
pletely consistent with the concordance model.
The Concordance Model Again
We have dis-
cussed the use of the cosmic microwave back-
ground and the large-scale distribution of galax-
ies in order to determine the cosmological param-
eters. Both methods independently give consis-
tent results. Combining them produces even more
(formally) accurate values. Furthermore, these
values are in agreement with the ones obtained
from the traditional cosmological tests discussed
in Sect. 20.5.
There are eight basic parameters describing
the concordance model. According the ﬁnal re-
sults of Planck (2015) they are:
Hubble constant H0 6.7 ± 0.5 kms−1 Mpc−1,
baryon density parameter Ωb 0.049 ± 0.001,
mass density parameter Ω0 0.259 ± 0.006,
redshift of reionisation zri 8.8 ± 1.1,
spectral index n 0.967 ± 0.004,
ﬂuctuation amplitude σ8 0.82 ± 0.01.
Other, less comprehensive tests, such as the
gravitational lensing by cosmic structures, the
velocities induced by mass concentrations, and
the number of clusters of galaxies, have added
support to the concordance model. This remark-
able agreement between many independent deter-
minations of the cosmological parameters have
earned the model its name. Once the parameters
necessary for a general description of the Uni-
verse are reasonably well known, other compo-
nents, such as gravitational waves or neutrinos,
can be included in the cosmological model. This
new development has been called the era of pre-
cision cosmology. However, it should still not be
forgotten that in the model one has to assume the
presence of both dark matter and dark energy, nei-
ther of which is based on any evidence apart from
their role in cosmology.
20.8
The Future of the Universe
The standard models allow two alternative pros-
pects for the future development of the Uni-
verse. Expansion may either go on forever, or it
may reverse to a contraction, where everything
is eventually squeezed back to a point. In the
ﬁnal squeeze, the early history of the Universe
would be repeated backwards: in turn, galaxies,
stars, atoms and nucleons would be broken up.
Finally the state of the Universe could no longer
be treated by present-day physics. It is not known
whether the collapse would continue to a single
point or would the Universe avoid the singularity
and start a new expansion.
However, according to the current observa-
tions, this is not the fate of the Universe. Instead,
the expansion will continue forever, even at an
accelerating pace.
In the open models the future is quite differ-
ent. The evolution of the stars may lead to one of
four end results: a white dwarf, a neutron star or
a black hole may be formed, or the star may be
completely disrupted. After about 1011 years, all

440
20
Cosmology
present stars will have used up their nuclear fuel
and reached one of these four ﬁnal states.
Some of the stars will be ejected from their
galaxies; others will form a dense cluster at the
centre. In about 1027 years the central star clus-
ters will become so dense that a black hole is
formed. Similarly the galaxies in large clusters
will collide and form very massive black holes.
Not even black holes last forever. By a quan-
tum mechanical tunnelling process, mass can
cross the event horizon and escape to inﬁnity—
the black hole is said to “evaporate”. The rate
of this phenomenon, known as the Hawking pro-
cess, is inversely proportional to the mass of the
hole. For a galactic-mass black hole, the evapo-
ration time is roughly 1098 years. After this time,
almost all black holes will have disappeared.
The ever expanding space now contains black
dwarfs, neutron stars and planet-size bodies (un-
less the predictions of a ﬁnite proton lifetime of
about 1031 years are conﬁrmed; in that case all
these systems will have been destroyed by pro-
ton decay). The temperature of the cosmic back-
ground radiation will have dropped to 10−20 K.
Even further in the future, other quantum phe-
nomena come into play. By a tunnelling pro-
cess, black dwarfs can change into neutron stars
and these, in turn, into black holes. In this way,
all stars are turned into black holes, which will
then evaporate. The time required has been esti-
mated to be 101026 years! At the end, only radi-
ation cooling towards absolute zero will remain
(Fig. 20.18).
Fig. 20.18 According to current results the future of the
Universe looks like this. After a very, very long time all
matter will have changed to radiation. The wavelength of
the radiation will increase inﬁnitely in an ever expanding
and cooling space
It is of course highly doubtful whether our
current cosmological theories really are secure
enough to allow such far-reaching predictions.
New theories and observations may completely
change our present cosmological ideas.

Ω0 > 1, = 1 and < 1. More generally, the con-

Box 20.2 (Three Redshifts) The redshift of
a distant galaxy is the result of three different
mechanisms acting together. The ﬁrst one is the
peculiar velocity of the observer with respect
to the mean expansion: the Earth moves about
the Sun, the Sun about the centre of the Milky
Way, and the Milky Way and the Local Group

of galaxies is falling towards the Virgo Cluster.
The apparatus measuring the light from a dis-
tant galaxy is not at rest; the velocity of the
instrument gives rise to a Doppler shift that
has to be corrected for. Usually the velocities
are much smaller than the speed of light. The
Doppler shift is then
zD = v/c.
(1)
For large velocities the relativistic formula has
to be used:
zD =

c + v
c −v −1.
(2)
The redshift appearing in Hubble’s law is the
cosmological redshift zc. It only depends on the
values of the scale factor at the times of emis-
sion and detection of the radiation (R and R0)
according to
zc = R0/R −1.
(3)
The third type of redshift is the gravitational
redshift zg. According to general relativity,
light will be redshifted by a gravitational ﬁeld.
For example, the redshift of radiation from the
surface of a star of radius R and mass M will
be
zg =
1
√1 −RS/R −1,
(4)
where RS = 2GM/c2 is the Schwarzschild ra-
dius of the star. The gravitational redshift of the
radiation from galaxies is normally insigniﬁ-
cant.
The combined effect of the redshifts can be
calculated as follows. If the rest wavelength λ0
is redshifted by the amounts z1 and z2 by two
different processes, so that
z = λ2 −λ0

or
(1 + z) = (1 + z1)(1 + z2).
Similarly, the three redshifts zD, zc and zg will
combine to give an observed redshift z, accord-
ing to
1 + z = (1 + zD)(1 + zc)(1 + zg).

(b) How is this related to the Olbers paradox?
(a) Imagine a circle with radius x around the ob-
server. A fraction s(x), 0 ≤s(x) ≤1, is cov-
ered by trees. Then we’ll move a distance dx
outward, and draw another circle. There are
2πnx dx trees growing in the annulus lim-
ited by these two circles. They hide a dis-
tance 2πxnD dx or a fraction nD dx of the
perimeter of the circle. Since a fraction s(x)
was already hidden, the contribution is only
(1 −s(x))nD dx. We get

For example, if there are 2000 trees per

can see to a distance of 50 m, on the average.

eventually meet a stellar surface in any direc-

Astrobiology
Is there life elsewhere in the universe? And if
there is, are there any intelligent beings? How
did life emerge on the Earth, and, as a matter
of fact, how do we deﬁne life and intelligence?
These are probably the most interesting unsolved
questions in science. During the last few decades
a whole new ﬁeld of astrobiology has evolved
around these problems.
21.1
What Is Life?
There have been several science ﬁction tv-series
showing extraterrestrial life forms. Usually the
sentient beings have appeared quite humanlike,
except of some appendices or other rather trivial
features that try to make them unattractive. They
may even have sex with humans. However, if the
foreign life forms have evolved independently, in-
terbreeding would be totally impossible.
The chemistry of foreign beings could be to-
tally different from ours. Could we even under-
stand that they are living beings? In fact, what is
life? It seems that life is an elusive concept, dif-
ﬁcult to deﬁne in terms of just a few properties.
We have only one example of life, and therefore
it is difﬁcult to make general conclusions of its
properties. However, we can assume that certain
properties of the known life forms may be gener-
alised also to foreign life.
Common features of all terrestrial life forms
are reproduction and evolution. If living be-
ings produced exact replicas of themselves, there
would be no evolution and no adaptation to
changing environments. Thus the reproduction
process must be slightly imperfect leading to
a variety of descendants. This will give material
for the natural selection, ‘survival of the ﬁttest’.
Natural selection is a fairly general principle,
working in some sense also outside of biology.
Are there any other general principles related to
the evolution of life? If we could ﬁnd even one ex-
ample of life that evolved independently of ours,
this would vastly improve our knowledge.
Energy consumption is also characteristic of
life. Life requires increasing order, i.e. decreasing
entropy. Local decrease of entropy is not against
thermodynamics: it only means that a living be-
ing must be able to take energy in some form
and utilise it for reproduction, growth, motion or
other purposes.
To produce similar offsprings a living being
must have the ability to store information and
pass it to its descendants. All terrestrial life forms
use DNA or RNA molecules composed of nu-
cleotides for storing information (see next sec-
tion).
Carbon can combine to form very complex
molecules. Silicon can also form large molecules
but they are not as stable as carbon compounds,
and silicon cannot form rings like carbon. Maybe
some simple life forms could be based on silicon,
or on something quite different that we have not
even thought of.
Also a liquid solvent is needed. Our own life
would not be possible without water. It remains
liquid in a much wider temperature range than
most other substances, which makes it a good sol-
vent. Yet in the astronomical sense the tempera-

Astrobiology
ture range is rather limited. In a colder environ-
ment, methane or ammonium might act as the sol-
vent.
The basic building block of all terrestrial life
forms is the cell. It has a membrane surrounding
liquid cytoplasm. The cell membrane is semiper-
meable and functions as a two-way ﬁlter that lets
certain molecules go in and others come out; this
selective transport is mediated via speciﬁc pro-
teinaceous channels. There are two kinds of cells,
simpler prokaryotic cells and more complex eu-
karyotic cells. In eukaryotic cells the genetic ma-
terial, in the form of DNA molecules, is inside
a nucleus, surrounded by a nuclear membrane. In
the prokaryotic cells there is no separate nucleus,
and the DNA ﬂoats coiled in the cytoplasm.
Terrestrial life is divided into three domains,
Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. Both Bacteria
and Archaea contain usually a single prokaryotic
cell. Eukarya contains all more complex beings,
like animals and plants.
According to this scheme viruses are not
alive although they have certain properties com-
mon to living beings. There are also some other
molecules, such as viroids and prions, that are not
classiﬁed as living; yet they are not quite inani-
mate.
If even the deﬁnition of terrestrial life leads to
such borderline cases, a more general deﬁnition
of all possible kinds of life is truly challenging.
Facing this problem we have to restrict our dis-
cussion to life that, at least to some extent, re-
sembles our own.
21.2
Chemistry of Life
The set of really important elements is relatively
small; it includes hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), ni-
trogen (N), carbon (C), sulphur (S) and phosphor
(P). The heavier elements can be remembered by
the mnemonic SPONC.
The importance of carbon is in its ability to
make lots of different very complex molecules,
which are essential for life. There are three ba-
sic types of molecules that function as common
building blocks to all life: lipids for membranes,
nucleotides and amino acids.
Amino acids consist of three different compo-
nents, a carboxyl (COOH), an amine part (NH2)
and a side chain, which can be just a single hydro-
gen or a more complex structure. Altogether there
are dozens of different amino acids, but only 20
of them are used in genetically coded proteins.
Amino acids can join to form more com-
plex molecules, proteins. Typically, up to sev-
eral hundred amino acids are needed for a pro-
tein molecule. Proteins have numerous functions:
they support structures, they act as catalysts in
nearly all biological reactions, in which case they
are called enzymes, they carry messages as hor-
mones, and so on.
Nucleotides are basic building blocks of the
genetic material, DNA and RNA. A nucleotide
has three components, a sugar, a phosphate group
and a base. The phosphate parts are always the
same. All DNA molecules have the same sugar
part; also all RNA molecules have the same sugar
part, which, however, differs from the sugar of the
DNA molecules by having one additional oxygen
atom. The base can be one of ﬁve different types,
adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine
(T), or uracil (U). DNA molecules contain bases
A, G, C and T, and RNA molecules A, G, C
and U.
Nucleotides join to form long chains. The de-
oxyribonucleic acid or DNA (Fig. 21.1) consists
of two such chains that are bound together as two
intertwined helices. The corresponding bases join
together by hydrogen bonds. The bases come al-
ways in matching pairs, AT, TA, CG, or GC.
A helix is like a screw that can be either left- or
righthanded. All terrestrial DNA molecules have
the same handedness or chirality: they are all of
L-type, or lefthanded. The reason for the asym-
metry is not quite understood.
The DNA molecule contains information on
how to make proteins. Three consecutive base
pairs form a code, called a codon, that speci-
ﬁes one amino acid. Usually thousands of such
triplets together contain instructions for building
a protein.
The basic units of heredity are called genes.
They are regions of DNA whose ﬁnal products
are either proteins or RNA molecules.
Human cells contain some 25,000 genes, and
the DNA consists of 3 × 109 base pairs. In plants

21.2
Chemistry of Life
447
Fig. 21.1 (a) The DNA molecule consists of two strands
of alternating phosphate groups and sugars connected
by matching base pairs. When the information stored in
a fragment of the DNA is needed, the strands separate and
the bases are used to produce an RNA molecule that will
contain the same information. (b) The strands coil to form
a double helix. (Webb: Where is everybody?)
the numbers can be much higher, but the simplest
known bacterial genomes have only a few hun-
dred genes. It has been estimated that the mini-
mum number of genes needed for a living being
is about 200–300.
Actually, only a part of the DNA contains ge-
netic information. The rest is called junk-DNA
since it has no known function. The fraction of
Fig. 21.1 (Continued)
the junk-DNA is highly variable; in some bacte-
ria the amount is very small.
The DNA is the storage of the genetic code,
but the code is not functional directly from the
DNA. Instead a complex molecular translation
machinery is needed to execute the instructions.
First, the instructions encoded in the genetic
sequence are copied (or transcribed) into another
type of nucleic acid. This ribonucleic acid or
RNA resembles the DNA but has one more oxy-
gen atom in its sugar. Different RNA molecules
serve several roles in the translation process.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the information
in the DNA to an organ called ribosome, com-
posed of several RNA’s and multiple proteins.
There another RNA, the transfer RNA (tRNA),
brings amino acids into the reaction site, and
still another RNA molecule, or one of the ribo-
somal RNA’s (rRNA) forms the linkages (peptide
bonds) between the adjacent amino acids.
RNA molecules have to carry instructions for
making just one protein, and thus they are much
shorter than DNA molecules. Still they contain
similar information, and in some simple life

448
21

forms like viruses they can act as the storage of
the genetic code.
21.3
Prerequisites of Life
Just after the big bang there were hardly any other
elements than hydrogen and helium. Heavier ele-
ments are needed, both for life itself and for solid
planets on which life can evolve. Thus at least
some of the earliest stars had to explode as su-
pernovas and eject their fusion products to the in-
terstellar space.
Most stars in elliptic galaxies and globular
clusters are very old and have a low metallicity.
Therefore they are not very probable locations for
life. The most suitable places for life seem to be
the disk populations of spiral galaxies, contain-
ing young stars with high abundances of heavier
elements.
Not all places of the galactic disk are equally
proﬁtable. Far out from the galactic centre the
star birth rate and consequently the metallicity is
low. Close to the centre, metallicity is high but
the environment is rather hostile. Star density is
very high, and therefore radiation is intense, and
nearby stars disturb planetary orbits. A rough es-
timate is that only about 20 % of the stars of
the Milky Way or a similar galaxy lie within the
galactic habitable zone.
Assume that a star is in the galactic habitable
zone. The star has its own habitable zone where
habitable planets can exist. This zone is usually
deﬁned as the region where the temperature is be-
tween the freezing and boiling points of water.
For a fast-rotating perfect blackbody (A = 0 in
Eq. (7.51)) orbiting the Sun this would mean that
its distance should be in the range 0.56–1.04 au.
Planets, however, are not blackbodies, and the
real situation is more complicated. If a planet has
a high albedo, it reﬂects away most of the inci-
dent radiation and its temperature will be much
lower. But depending on the chemical composi-
tion of the atmosphere and possible clouds the
greenhouse effect may increase the temperature
considerably. Many gases are transparent to visi-
ble light, allowing it to heat the surface. Most of
the energy is emitted back in the infrared region,
which is effectively absorbed by these green-
house gases, such as water vapour, carbon diox-
ide and methane, and thus remains trapped in the
atmosphere.
If the star is cool, the habitable zone is very
narrow. Hot stars have wider habitable zones, but
their main sequence phase is short, giving little
time for life to evolve. Thus main sequence stars
not too different from the Sun are usually con-
sidered the best candidates for having habitable
planets.
During the main sequence phase a star will be-
come a little brighter, which will push the hab-
itable zone slightly outwards. Thus the region
where the temperature remains suitable for a long
period of time is narrower than the habitable zone
at any given moment. The continuously habitable
zone can be deﬁned as the region that remains
habitable for a time that is comparable to the main
sequence phase of the star. For the Sun the es-
timates of the width of this region vary at least
from 0.06 au up to 0.2 au. The problem is how to
model albedo and greenhouse effects over a very
long period of time.
Binary stars are very common, but at least ear-
lier it was thought that they could not have habit-
able planets, since planetary orbits would be com-
plicated or unstable. However, there are two kinds
of possible orbits that might be suitable. If the
components of a binary are far away from each
other, each component could have a planetary
system of its own. Or, if it’s a close binary, there
can be distant planets orbiting the whole binary
system.
21.4
Hazards
Even if life could emerge, there are many hazards
that may wipe it out. By looking at the Moon we
can see that meteor bombardment was very in-
tense in the young solar system. Collision of a big
asteroid or comet could be fatal, the immediate
devastation caused by the explosion being only
one of the consequences. The collision would
eject a lot of dust to the atmosphere cooling the
climate for several years. The mass extinction 65
million years ago seems to have been caused by

21.4
Hazards
449
Fig. 21.2 In the young solar system small objects col-
lided continuously to larger planets, threatening seriously
the evolution of life. Later collisions and perturbations by
planets have cleaned away most of the potentially danger-
ous objects. Still collisions take place even nowadays. In
1994 comet Shoemaker-Levy collided to Jupiter after dis-
integrating into several parts. Traces of the collisions of
the fragments were seen as dark spots in the atmosphere of
Jupiter. In June 20, 1908, an explosion happened in Tun-
guska, Siberia, hewing down trees in a couple of thousand
square kilometres. The explosion was possibly caused by
a comet with a diameter of about hundred metres
such an event. As the comet Shoemaker-Levy hit-
ting Jupiter (Fig. 21.2) in 1994 showed, such col-
lisions are still possible. Fortunately they are not
very frequent any more.
Almost all of the currently known exoplanets
are Jupiter-like giants. They seem to be neces-
sary for habitable planets, because their pertur-
bations clean the young solar system from debris
by ejecting it outside the planetary system. How-
ever, many of the known giant planets move on
highly eccentric orbits, and they may disturb also
the orbits of earthlike planets. Thus it is further
required that the giant planets should be on nearly
circular orbits and not too close to the star.
Also smaller planets have participated in clear-
ing the regions around their orbits, which is re-
ﬂected in the new deﬁnition of a planet (Sect. 7.1).
Seasons depend on the obliquity of the rota-
tion axis and the eccentricity of the orbit. High
values will lead to strong seasonal temperature
variations. In the case of the Earth the Moon
seems to have a stabilising effect; without the
Moon the tilt of the axis would have varied much
more, possibly causing more severe ice ages fatal
to life. Hence also a relatively big moon seems to
be in the shopping list of a habitable planet. How-
ever, recently there have been some objections to
this requirement.
We have only recently started to understand
the rather delicate balance and complex feedback
effects working in the atmosphere. Currently the
climate is warming due to the increasing green-
house effect, but the Earth has experienced also
quite opposite phases. If the albedo increases, the
amount of energy reaching the surface decreases,
glaciers and snow cover expand, and the amount
of clouds increases till most of the atmospheric
humidity is solidiﬁed as snow and ice. All this
will increase the albedo further, speeding up this
icehouse effect. There is geological evidence of
global glaciation periods 750–580 million years
ago and possibly also 2.3 billion years ago. The
Snowball Earth hypothesis assumes that the cli-
mate cooled down for millions of years and the
whole surface was covered by a layer of ice at
least one kilometer thick. During the long cold
period most of the living organisms, all of which
at that time lived in water, became extinct. Vol-
canic activity was still going on, adding more car-
bon dioxide to the atmosphere. Finally the result-
ing greenhouse effect started to warm the climate.
There are many factors that seem to be crucial
for life. Some of them may not look very impor-
tant, but might still have made it impossible for

450
21
Astrobiology
life to emerge. However, in many cases we don’t
know how important they really are or if they are
equally crucial for foreign life forms.
21.5
Origin of Life
One way to try to understand the origin of the ter-
restrial life is to start with the available atoms and
molecules and see if they could produce life. Dur-
ing the last decades there has been considerable
progress, but the process is very complicated and
not yet well understood. Here we can only outline
brieﬂy how it might have happened.
In a famous experiment in 1953 Harold Urey
and Stanley Miller sent energy in the form of
electric sparks through a gas mixture supposed
to be similar to the early atmosphere of the
Earth, containing methane, ammonia, hydrogen
and water vapour. After a few days the solution
contained several organic compounds, including
some amino acids. At that time it was assumed
that the early atmosphere was reducing. More re-
cent studies suggest that this is not quite true, and
the earliest atmosphere was rather neutral, con-
taining mostly CO2, CO, N2, H2O and maybe
some H2. Such an atmosphere would have pro-
duced organic compounds much slower, if at all.
Some amino acids have been found in me-
teorites. Thus they seem to have been already
present in the nebula from which the planetary
system condensed. Complex organic molecules
have been found also in interstellar molecule
clouds (Sect. 15.3). There have even been claims
of detecting the simplest amino acid, glycine, but
the results are controversial.
The next step, putting the basic blocks to-
gether to form DNA or RNA molecules, is much
more difﬁcult. This looks like the chicken and
egg paradox: the information contained in the
DNA is needed to make proteins, and proteins
are needed to catalyse the production of the nu-
cleotides, which are the building blocks of the nu-
cleic acids. So which came ﬁrst?
In the 1980’s Sidney Altman and Thomas
Cech found that some RNA molecules can act as
catalysts. Since RNA resembles DNA, it can store
genetic material to some extent. Thus there is no
need for the DNA and proteins. Even RNA frag-
ments cannot be synthesised easily, but as they
act as enzymes and can replicate, it is assumed
that the initial chemical evolution ﬁrst led to short
and relatively simple RNA molecules. Eventually
some of then combined to more complex ones,
some of which were better adapted to the envi-
ronment either by replicating faster or by being
more durable. Thus the natural selection started
to produce more complex molecules; this chem-
ical evolution was working already before actual
life emerged.
The ﬁrst cell-like structures could evolve
from asymmetric molecules or lipids, one end
of which attracts water and the other end re-
pels water. In water such molecules tend to form
bi-layered membranes where the hydrophilic or
water-attracting end points outwards and hy-
drophobic or water-repelling end inwards. Fur-
ther on, such membranes form spontaneously
spherical vesicles. If RNA happened to get in-
side such a membrane, it may have been protected
from the environment, and could have been con-
tained within its own chemical environment. In
some cases this could have improved its replica-
tion, and thus led to further increase its concen-
tration within the vesicle.
A rather common assumption is that the ﬁrst
primitive life forms were RNA life. However, re-
cently this theory has been challenged. RNA has
some drawbacks. It is not as stable as DNA, and
its replication is not as accurate as the protein me-
diated replication of DNA. If the life was initially
based on RNA, evolution led ﬁnally to the appear-
ance of DNA molecules. Since DNA is superior
to RNA due to its stability, it soon took over the
role of information carrier.
Currently the energy of sunlight is utilised
by plants and some bacteria in photosynthe-
sis, which produces carbohydrates from water
and carbon dioxide. There are also organisms
that do not need sunlight but can use chemi-
cal energy to produce organic matter in a pro-
cess called chemosynthesis. Such organisms have
been found e.g. near hydrothermal vents on mid-
ocean ridges (Fig. 21.3). These vents eject hot
mineral-rich water to the ocean. Even though
the temperature can be as high as 400 °C, the

21.5
Origin of Life
451
Fig. 21.3 Black smokers in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are
hydrothermal vents that sprout hot mineral-rich water.

search Program (NURP); NOAA)
high pressure prevents the water from boiling.
Although this is too hot for life, there are re-
gions around the vents where the temperature is
suitable for such thermophiles. They could have
been the ﬁrst life forms, in which case life did not
emerge in a Darwinian warm pond but in a hot
pressure kettle. However, this is also a matter of
debate.
This kind of bottom-up approach tries to build
life from the simple constituents already avail-
able in the interstellar space. Another approach,
the top-down method, tries to trace life back in
time as far as possible.
The oldest sediment rocks on the Earth, found
in Isua in western Greenland, are 3.8 Ga old.
Since they contain sediments, deposited by water,
and pillow lavas, formed in water, the tempera-
ture at that time could not have a value very dif-
ferent from the current one. The solar luminosity
was then lower than nowadays, but the difference
was compensated by a higher amount of decaying
radioactive materials and remanent heat of the re-
cently born Earth.
Oldest signs of life are almost as old. These
signs are, however, just isotope ratios that can be
interpreted as results of bacterial life. The carbon
isotope 12C is about 100 times as abundant as the
heavier isotope 13C. The lighter isotope is some-
what more reactive and tends to be enriched in
living organisms. In the Isua rocks there are sed-
iments with a small excess of 12C, which might
indicate some kind of life.
In the Warrawoona Group in Australia there
are 3.5 Ga old formations that look like stro-
matolites, mounds consisting of layers of mi-
crobial cells and calcium carbonate. If they are
real stromatolites, they may have been formed by
cyanobacteria, but this is still a matter of debate.
In the early times, at least for a billion years,
photosynthesis was non-oxygenic. Cyanobacte-
ria were possibly the ﬁrst organisms capable of
oxygenic photosynthesis. They started to produce
oxygen, but initially it was dissolved in water and
consumed in different oxidation reactions. Even-
tually also the amount of atmospheric oxygen
started to rise, and 2.2 Ga ago it reached 10 %
of the current value, i.e. about 2 % of the total
abundance in the atmosphere.
First eukaryotes appeared in the fossil record
2.1 Ga ago and multicellular organisms 1.5 Ga
ago. The fossil evidence becomes much clearer
towards the end of the Proterozoic era. The Edi-
acara fauna, which is about 600 million years old,
contains the oldest fossils of big and complex an-
imals. These were softbodied animals. At the end
of the Cambrian period 543 million years ago
traces of the Ediacara fauna disappear and are re-
placed by a huge variety of new animals, many
with protecting shields. This increase in the vari-
ety of life forms is called the Cambrian explosion.
All life forms use similar genetic codes, which
indicates that they have the same origin. This
forefather of all life is called LUCA, the Last Uni-
versal Common Ancestor.
Relationships of living beings can be studied
by comparing their DNA or RNA. The more the
molecules of two species differ, the more distant
the species are in the evolutionary sense. These

A branch is the older the

common ancestor, LUCA.
(Adapted from Webb:
Where is everybody?)
distances can be plotted as a map, called the phy-
logenetic tree (Fig. 21.4).
The phylogenetic tree, as we now know it, has
three branches, the domains of Archaea, Bacte-
ria and Eukarya. The organisms closest to the
root are thermophiles that live close to hydrother-
mal vents or in hot water. Obviously, the LUCA
lived in such a hot environment. However, RNA
molecules do not remain intact in such hot en-
vironments. If the earliest life was RNA life, it
would have evolved in a cooler environment. Cur-
rently we do not know the real birthplace of life.
Although the phylogenetic tree points to a
common origin, there may have been other starts,
too, but natural selection has eliminated the other
ones that were less competitive.
21.6
Are We Martians?
Mars and the Earth have very similar rotation pe-
riods and axial tilts. Since the notorious ‘discov-
ery’ of canals, Mars and its inhabitants have been
a popular subject in science ﬁction stories. Later
observations revealed a very thin atmosphere and
low temperature, which make Mars a rather hos-
tile place. Finally, the Viking landers showed
a marred planet. Yet the possibility of some sim-
ple life forms cannot be excluded.
In 1984 a meteorite was found in the Allan
Hills region in Antarctica and labelled as ALH
84001 (Fig. 21.5). The piece of rock was esti-
mated to be 3.9 Ga old. Chemistry of the mete-
orite shows that it had originated on Mars; an im-
pact had thrown it to an orbit that brought it to the
Earth.
In 1996 a group of NASA scientists an-
nounced that the meteorite contained structures
resembling fossilised microbes and compounds
that could be products of living organisms, such
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (or PAH)
and magnetite. However, they can be produced by
other processes, too. Not surprisingly, the results
and the implications of Martian life caused a lot
of scepticism. Only further Mars expeditions and

ALH 84001 found in
Antarctica has a chemical
composition that indicates
its Martian origin. The

substances that can be

organisms. The wormlike
structures resemble
bacteria. It is, however,
reasonable to ask whether
one single sample can
prove that once there was
life on Mars. (NASA)
possible in situ experiments can decide whether
there has been life on Mars.
In case there has really been life on Mars, there
are several possibilities:
• Life originated independently on the Earth and
Mars.
• Life originated only on the Earth and was then
transported to Mars.
• Life originated only on Mars and was trans-
ported to the Earth.
It seems that life on the Earth emerged almost
as soon as the conditions became favourable. It
has been argued that the life appeared even too
quickly. This problem would be solved if life
originated on Mars. The surface of the more dis-
tant and smaller Mars had cooled down faster
to become habitable before the Earth. Thus life
would have had more time to evolve on Mars,
and was transferred to the Earth when conditions
here became suitable. Thus our earliest ancestors
could be Martian bacteria. Presently such consid-
erations are, however, just speculations.
The idea of life spreading from one celestial
body to another is known as panspermia. The
idea dates back to the antiquity, but its ﬁrst seri-
ous advocate was the Swedish chemist Svante Ar-

454
21
Astrobiology
rhenius, who published a book on the subject in
1908. Of the later proponents, Sir Fred Hoyle was
the most famous. Panspermia ﬁt well to his cos-
mology: the universe had no beginning, neither
did life, but had always existed. Thus the tough
problem of the origin of life was neatly avoided.
Now panspermia, in a certain more limited
sense, begins to seem a little more possible the-
ory. Primitive life forms can survive inside me-
teorites in the coldness and lethal radiation of
the interplanetary space long enough to travel
from one planet to another. Interstellar distances,
though, are too long, and the probability of a me-
teoroid from one planetary system hitting another
system is too low. It seems obvious that our life
has originated here in our own solar system.
21.7
Life in the Solar System
Once there may have been life on Mars. Although
probes have not detected signs of life, it is not
impossible that there might still be some mi-
croscopic life, but we cannot expect to ﬁnd any
macroscopic life forms. The same is true for other
places in our solar system.
Mercury has no atmosphere, Venus is too hot,
and the giant planets have no solid surface. Be-
sides the Earth and Mars this leaves only some
satellites as possible habitats. It has also been
speculated that there might be living things ﬂoat-
ing in the atmospheres of the giant planets, but
the emergence and evolution of such things seems
rather improbable.
Europa as well as some other icy satellites
are nowadays considered potential places for life.
Their surfaces are too cold, but tidal heating
keeps the interiors warm enough. Big satellites
rotate synchronously, but if the orbit is not per-
fectly circular, the orbital velocity varies accord-
ing to Kepler’s second law. Thus the satellite li-
brates just like our Moon, which means that the
direction of the tidal distortion keeps changing.
Also the distance to the planet varies, and there-
fore the magnitude of the tidal force varies, too.
These effects deform the satellite continuously
giving rise to tidal heating.
Europa’s surface is covered by ice. In some
places the ice cover is broken into plates that ob-
viously have moved relative to each other. The ro-
tation period of the surface differs from the rota-
tion period of the magnetic ﬁeld, which is frozen
to the interior. Observations seem to indicate that
the ice cover ﬂoats on an ocean.
The illumination under the ice is too dim for
photosynthesis, but there might be thermal vents
as in the oceans of the Earth. Hence the ocean
could be a habitat for microbes that can utilise
the thermal energy.
Titan is the only satellite with a thick atmo-
sphere. The atmosphere is also rich in organic
compounds, like methane. Methane dissociates
rapidly, and thus the high methane content means
that there must be a source of new methane. Liv-
ing organisms are one such source, but because
of its coldness Titan does not look like a promis-
ing place for life. A more plausible theory was
that there was a methane ocean on Titan but the
Huygens probe revealed a rather dry landscape,
which, however, has signs of liquid ﬂows. Radar
images sent by the Cassini probe show some dark
areas that might be methane lakes (Fig. 8.25).
21.8
Detecting Life
If we ﬁnd a potentially habitable planet, is there
any hope that we can see if life has emerged on
it? The question can be answered by studying
whether we can ﬁnd life on the Earth from satel-
lite observations. In 1990 the Galileo probe made
just such experiments, and it seems that it is in-
deed possible to detect life, at least the kind of
life we have on the Earth. Similar observations of
the Moon showed no traces of life.
The detection is based on spectroscopic obser-
vations that can reveal some signatures of life.
These signatures are in the infrared part of the
spectrum, thus requiring observations made out-
side the atmosphere.
There are two emission features that are strong
indicators of life, ozone and methane. Photosyn-
thesis is the most probable source of molecular
oxygen, which is then broken into two oxygen
atoms by ultraviolet radiation. The free oxygen
atoms join to molecules to form ozone. Methane
is also produced by living beings. It is quickly ox-
idised, and has to be continuously replenished to

21.9

keep the level noticeable. However, there can be
large reservoirs of methane, particularly in cold
environments. Thus methane itself is not a sign
of life, but if it is found together with ozone, the
evidence becomes more convincing.
Another feature is the infrared reﬂectance
spectrum of the green plants. Chlorophyll absorbs
visible light, particularly blue and red, but there
is a distinct cutoff called the red-edge, seen as
a steep gradient of the spectrum between 690 and
740 nm. Longer wavelengths are very effectively
reﬂected to avoid excessive heating.
21.9
SETI—Detecting Intelligent Life
Mankind has been sending radio transmissions
for almost a century. Our radio signals are now
ﬁlling a sphere with a radius of almost one
hundred lightyears. Another civilisation orbiting
a nearby star might be able to pick up this trans-
mission with a big radio telescope. Such leakage
radiation is, however, very weak. Sensitivity of
our own radio receivers has increased enormously
since they were invented. Thus it has been possi-
ble to reduce the power of the transmitters, and
the signals leaking to space have become weaker.
Also, more and more signals are sent in cables
and optical ﬁbres. If another civilisation has un-
dergone similar development, detecting leakage
signals is extremely difﬁcult. Chances are much
better if the signal has been sent intentionally to-
wards potential receivers in the hope that some-
body will detect it.
One might think that galaxies and star clusters
are worth listening, since there are many stars in
the narrow beam of the telescope. Unfortunately,
it is not quite so. Other galaxies are so far away
that the signal could be too weak to be detected.
Globular clusters consist of very old stars with
low metallicity. Thus the probability of ﬁnding
a habitable planet is tiny indeed. Open clusters
are relatively young, and life may not have had
time to evolve to a communicating civilisation.
Thus galaxies and star clusters are not the best
places to search for signs of life.
What frequency should we use? If the sending
and receiving party have developed radio astron-
omy, they must be aware of certain common fre-
quencies, like the hydrogen 21 cm radiation. Such
a wavelength itself may not be a good choice be-
cause of the background noise, but some of its
multiples or a sum of two common frequencies
might fall in the quiet part of the radio spectrum.
A good frequency could be the H2O maser emis-
sion at 22 GHz. Around this frequency the sky
is pretty quiet except for a few sources. But it
is not enough to listen to those frequencies only,
since they are Doppler shifted due to the relative
motion of the transmitter and receiver. And if the
transmitter and/or receiver are on planets orbiting
a star, the Doppler shift will change periodically.
Fortunately, current receivers are capable of fol-
lowing millions of frequencies simultaneously.
Radio emission from natural sources can be
steady noise or vary in a periodic, quasiperiodic
or chaotic manner. If we want to send a signal to
be recognised as artiﬁcial, it should contain a pat-
tern that cannot arise naturally. It could e.g. con-
tain an increasing number of pulses representing
the ﬁrst few prime numbers.
Although most SETI research concentrates on
radio frequencies, also optical wavelengths have
recently been considered seriously. Pulsed lasers
pack a lot of energy to a short pulse (lasting typi-
cally one nanosecond) conﬁned to a very narrow
wavelength band and a narrow beam. The ﬂash
can be even brighter than the central star. If such
a signal were pointed towards us, it should be rel-
atively easy to detect. Such optical SETI research,
or OSETI, has already been started, but it is still
behind the radioastronomical SETI.
In 1974 Frank Drake used the Arecibo radio
telescope to send a message towards the globular
cluster M13 (which is not a good place for life).
The message contained 1679 pulses (Fig. 21.6).
This number has exactly two factors, 23 and 73.
Thus the receiver, who obviously must under-
stand some mathematics, could guess that the
message contains a two-dimensional picture. If
we ever detect such a message, we can be pretty
certain of its artiﬁcial origin, even if we were not
able to interpret the message.
The ﬁrst serious SETI project (Search for Ex-
traTerrestrial Civilisations) was carried out in
1960, also by Frank Drake. This project Ozma
observed two nearby stars, τ Cet and ε Eri, at the
21 cm wavelength. Since then radio technology

456

Astrobiology
Fig. 21.6 The signal sent with the Arecibo radio tele-
scope consists of 1679 pulses. The number 1679 has only
two factors, 23 and 73, so obviously the signal represents
a twodimensional image of 23 × 73 pixels. A lot of in-
formation about the sender is coded in the image, but it
is difﬁcult to say whether the receiving civilisation could
interpret it. In any case, the artiﬁcial origin of the signal is
indisputable
has improved enormously, and currently we are
able to listen to a huge number of channels at the
same time.
There are two basic search strategies. In a tar-
geted search we listen to a few objects that are po-
tential candidates for harbouring life. In a wide-
sky survey large areas of the sky are scanned.
Most current projects belong to the latter cate-
gory.
Observing time with large telescopes is ex-
pensive, and priority is given to projects that can
be expected to produce positive results. In some
projects, like SERENDIP, this problem is avoided
by having the receiver sit piggyback on some
other instrument and listen to whatever the tele-
scope happens to be observing. Thus the SETI
project does not need any dedicated time of its
own. The drawback is, of course, that many of
the target areas may not be interesting in the SETI
sense.
Detecting a potentially artiﬁcial signal among
the huge amount of data requires a lot of comput-
ing power. The seti@home project has connected
millions of computers to an enormous virtual ma-
chine to analyse the data. Anyone with a com-
puter connected to the Internet can load a screen-
saver program that will automatically fetch pack-
ets of data and send back the results.
Thus far not a single message sent by another
civilisation has been conﬁrmed. There have been
some interesting cases, but they have been single
bursts of unknown origin. They have not been de-
tected later, not even with more sensitive instru-
ments.
21.10 Number of Civilisations
Although no extraterrestrial civilisation has been
found, we can try to estimate their number. The
SETI pioneer Frank Drake suggested a formula
for calculating the number of civilisations in the
Milky Way capable of communication at a given
instant:
N = R × fp × fh × fl × fi × fc × L,
(21.1)
where N is the total number of communicating
civilisations in the Milky Way, R is the annual
birth rate of stars, fp is the fraction of stars pos-
sessing planets, fh is the fraction of planets be-
ing habitable, fl is the fraction of habitable plan-
ets having some kind of life, fi is the fraction of
these planets having intelligent life, fc is the frac-
tion of intelligent civilisations that have devel-
oped means for interstellar communication, and
ﬁnally L is the time in years that such a civilisa-
tion has been communicating. All the f -factors
are probabilities that are in the range [0,1].

21.11
Exercises
457
The astronomical factors (R, fp and fh) are
the only ones that are known with any accuracy.
The biological factors, fl and fi, involve a lot of
guesswork. The last two factors, fc and L, are
even harder, since they are related to the socio-
logical behaviour of the exocivilisation.
Actually, the formula was intended as the ba-
sis of the agenda of an inﬂuential SETI meeting
held in Green Bank in 1961. It splits the prob-
lem nicely into smaller subproblems that can be
discussed separately. But using the formula to
ﬁnd the actual number of civilisations is not very
meaningful, since so many of the factors are to-
tally unknown. In the most “optimistic” case we
could ﬁnd out that the distance between neigh-
bouring civilisations is just a few parsecs, but giv-
ing the probabilities small (possibly more realis-
tic) values, their product might be so minute that
we ought to be alone in the Milky Way. At least
the formula shows how little we know.
Even if favourable conditions and evolution of
communicating civilisations were relatively com-
mon, the last factor may turn out to be the limiting
one. If the lifetime of a civilisation is short com-
pared to the age of the universe, the chances of
hearing a message from another star are poor.
Earlier many astronomers seemed to think that
exocivilisations would not be that rare, while bi-
ologists showed that the evolution of life had so
many obstacles that we should not expect to ﬁnd
other civilisations in our neighbourhood. Now we
understand better both the biochemistry of early
life and the many problems in having a habitable
planet. Although opinions vary considerably, we
might guess that very simple microbe-like life is
relatively common, but intelligent, communicat-
ing beings might be extremely rare.

ton of TNT corresponds to the energy of 4.184 ×
109 joules.

22
Exoplanets
The Copernican principle means that the Earth
has gradually lost its special status: it is just a
planet orbiting a relatively common star in an or-
dinary galaxy. But how common planetary sys-
tems are? Nowadays we think that they belong to
the normal life of a star. However, it is difﬁcult
to make ground based observations of exoplan-
ets, i.e. planets orbiting some other star than our
Sun. The light reﬂected by the planet is so dim
that it is swamped with the light of the star. The
situation is, however, improving thanks to evolv-
ing observation methods.
22.1
Other Planetary Systems
At the beginning of 2016 over 1300 planetary
systems and a total of over 2000 planets had been
found. The numbers have increased rapidly dur-
ing the last few years. It seems that the birth of
planetary systems is more and more closely re-
lated to the birth process of stars.
Due to the observing methods most of the
known exoplanets are rather massive. Recently
also planets about the size of the Earth have been
detected. The next big question is if any of them
is suitable for harbouring life.
Origin of planetary systems have been studied
using theoretical calculations. Most calculations
have dealt with single stars around which stable
planetary orbits are easier to ﬁnd. However, stable
orbits are also possible around wide binary stars
either close to one of the components, or so far
that the planet orbits both components.
The Milky Way contains about 1011 stars.
Maybe 109–1010 of them have suitable condi-
tions for a planetary system.
The ﬁrst exoplanet was found in 1992. It was
quite a strange object, orbiting a pulsar. Pulsars
are ﬁnal stages of stellar evolution, and planets
orbiting the star should be destroyed.
Some earlier observations had given hints
about exoplanets but they were not conclusive.
The ﬁrst exoplanet orbiting an ordinary star was
found in 1995 around β Pictoris.
In addition to planets orbiting a star there are
some indications of rogue planets that have es-
caped from planetary systems. Star density in star
birth regions can be so high that the perturba-
tions of other stars throw planets away from their
original orbits. Such runaway planets are even
more difﬁcult to detect than planets orbiting other
stars.
22.2
Observational Methods
Although only a few planets can be observed
directly with current methods, the existence of
planets can be deduced using several indirect
methods.
Astrometric methods are based on perturba-
tions of the proper motion or radial velocity of
the star. If the mass of the star is big enough the
centre of mass will be clearly displaced from the
star. For example, the centre of mass of our solar
system is outside the surface of the Sun, and the
Sun as well the planets orbit around this point.

Exoplanets
Therefore the motion of the Sun through space is
not linear but shows particularly the 12 year pe-
riod of Jupiter’s orbital motion.
Earliest observations were based on similar as-
trometric measurements as with binary stars. The
wobble of the star caused by a planet is so minute
that the results were not conclusive. The advan-
tage of the method is that it does not depend on
the angle between the orbital plane and the line of
sight.
Much more precise results have been obtained
by studying the periodic changes of the radial ve-
locities of stars using the Doppler effect. The ra-
dial velocities of many nearby stars show indeed
periodic variations indicating that they have mas-
sive invisible companions. The method makes
it possible to detect Jupiterlike planets around
nearby planets, but smaller ones are too light to
cause detectable variations in the radial veloc-
ity of the star. This is why most of the currently
known exoplanets are more massive than Jupiter.
This method works the better the closer the ob-
server is to the orbital plane of the orbit. If the or-
bital plane is almost perpendicular to the line of
sight no Doppler shift cannot be seen.
A third method is based on transits of plan-
ets: when a planet is between the star and the ob-
server it occults a part of the stellar disk. Such
events have already been observed with ground
based telescopes, but especially the Kepler space-
craft sent by NASA in 2009 has investigated them
by following about one hundred thousand stars in
the galactic habitable zone. The method works,
of course, only if the observer is very close to the
orbital plane of the planet. Yet over a thousand
planets have been found, many of which are about
the size of the Earth. Planetary transits are seen
as very regular dimming of the star. At the same
time the satellite has observed also other kinds of
brightness variations, thus advancing studies of
variable stars.
A fourth method is gravitational lensing. If a
star passes in front of a background star its grav-
ity will bend the light, and the background star
will look brighter. If the front star has planets the
brightening is slightly stronger than without plan-
ets.
Also rogue planets can be detected with the
transit or gravitational lens methods. Then the
brightness will change only once and for a very
short period. Interpretation of such events is prob-
lematic: is it really a planet or a phenomenon of
the star itself.
A ﬁfth method is timing, which is well applied
to regularly variable stars. A planet causes the
distance of the star vary slightly, which changes
the periodicity of the brightness variation of the
star in a regular manner.
This was the method that gave the ﬁrst con-
vincing evidence of exoplanets in 1992 when the
pulsation of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 showed
regular variation. The discovery was strange
since a pulsar should not have planets. The ob-
jects may be second generation planets that con-
densed from the material ejected by a supernova
explosion. Later the same method has also re-
vealed some planets around variable stars.
Direct imaging of exoplanets is not yet an ef-
fective search method. The ﬁrst images show ob-
jects whose existence has already been conﬁrmed
with other methods (Fig. 22.1).
Fig. 22.1 A detailed image of the circumstellar disk
around β Pictoris was obtained with the ESO ADONIS
adaptive optics system at the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla,
Chile, and the Observatoire de Grenoble coronagraph at
the wavelength of 1.25 microns in 1996. The full extent
of the disk is about 1500 AU. The area around the star
masked by the coronagraph is only 24 AU (correspond-
ing to a distance from the Sun to halfway between Uranus
and Neptune). No planets are directly seen but their grav-
itational effects can be detected as a bending of the main
plane in the inner part of the disk. (ESO)

Properties of Exoplanets

Also young recently born stars can indicate
planetary systems. Many stars are surrounded by
a dust disk (Fig. 22.2). The easiest way to explain
the infrared radiation of some young stars is to
assume a massive disk surrounding the star and
interacting with the star. Later the disk can evolve
to a planetary system. Such disks have been de-
tected around e.g. Vega and β Pictoris.
Fig. 22.2 The ﬁrst image of an exoplanet was obtained
in 2004 with the VLT telescope. The mass of the planet is
about ﬁve times the mass of Jupiter and it orbits a brown
dwarf at a distance of 55 AU. (ESO)
22.3
Properties of Exoplanets
For practical reasons it is easiest to ﬁnd big plan-
ets orbiting close to a star. They affect the posi-
tion of the star most strongly, and due to the short
orbital period the periodicity of the variations is
most easy to detect. Therefore many of the exo-
planets are such “hot jupiters”. This is seen in the
distribution of Fig. 22.3. A great majority of the
exoplanets found this far are clearly more mas-
sive than the Earth. This is another example of a
statistical bias caused by a selection effect typ-
ical in astronomy. There may be a lot of Earth-
sized planets but they are extremely difﬁcult to
observe.
The planetary orbits of our own solar system
are nearly circular. If Mercury is excluded the
eccentricity of every orbit is less than 0.1. Or-

uncertain

462

bits of the exoplanets, on the other hand, can be
very eccentric (Fig. 22.4). Theories concerning
the evolution of planetary systems must be able to
explain how the eccentricities decrease by, for ex-
ample, collisions of minor bodies or mutual per-
turbations of planets.
When also solid earthlike planets can be ob-
served the next question is, if any of them has an
environment suitable for life. After that we can
investigate if their spectra show features typical
for life mentioned in the previous chapter.

Units of Angle and Solid Angle
Radian is the
angular unit most suitable for theoretical studies.
One radian is the angle subtended by a circular
arc whose length equals the radius. If r is the ra-
dius of a circle and s the length of an arc, the arc
subtends an angle
α = s/r.
Since the circumference of the circle is 2πr,
we have
2π rad = 360◦
or
1 rad = 180◦/π.
In an analogous way we can deﬁne a stera-
dian, a unit of solid angle, as the solid angle sub-
tended by a unit area on the surface of a unit
sphere as seen from the centre. An area A on the
surface of a sphere with radius r subtends a solid
angle
ω = A/r2.
Since the area of the sphere is 4πr2, a full
solid angle equals 4π steradians.

Taylor Series
Let us consider a differentiable real-valued func-
tion of one variable f : R →R. The tangent to
the graph of the function at x0 is
y = f (x0) + f ′(x0)(x −x0),
where f ′(x0) is the derivative of f at x0. Now,
if x is close to x0, the graph of the tangent at x
will not be very far from the graph of the function
itself. Thus, we can approximate the function by
f (x) ≈f (x0) + f ′(x0)(x −x0).
The approximation becomes worse, the more the
derivative f ′ varies in the interval [x0,x]. The
rate of change of f ′ is described by the second
derivative f ′′, and so on. To improve accuracy,
we have to also include higher derivatives. It can
be shown that the value of the function f at x is
(assuming that the derivatives exist)

Many problems involve small perturbations, in
which case it is usually possible to ﬁnd expres-
sions having very rapidly converging Taylor ex-
pansions. The great advantage of this is the re-
duction of complicated functions to simple poly-
nomials. Particularly useful are linear approxima-
tions, such as
√

2x,

etc.

Vector Calculus
A vector is an entity with two essential proper-
ties: magnitude and direction. Vectors are usually
denoted by boldface letters a, b, A, B etc. The
sum of the vectors A and B can be determined
graphically by moving the origin of B to the tip of
A and connecting the origin of A to the tip of B.
The vector −A has the same magnitude as A, is

466
A
Mathematics
parallel to A, but points in the opposite direction.
The difference A −B is deﬁned as A + (−B).
Addition of vectors satisﬁes the ordinary rules
of commutativity and associativity,
A + B = B + A,
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.
A point in a coordinate frame can be speciﬁed
by giving its position or radius vector, which ex-
tends from the origin of the frame to the point.
The position vector r can be expressed in terms
of basis vectors, which are usually unit vectors,
i.e. have a length of one distance unit. In a rectan-
gular xyz-frame, we denote the basis vectors par-
allel to the coordinate axes by ˆi, ˆj and ˆk. The po-
sition vector corresponding to the point (x,y,z)
is then
r = xˆi + y ˆj + z ˆk.
The numbers x, y and z are the components of r.
Vectors can be added by adding their compo-
nents. For example, the sum of
A = axˆi + ay ˆj + az ˆk,
B = bxˆi + by ˆj + bz ˆk,
is
A + B = (ax + bx)ˆi + (ay + by) ˆj + (az + bz)ˆk.
The magnitude of a vector r in terms of its com-
ponents is
r = |r| =

x2 + y2 + z2.
The scalar product of two vectors A and B is
a real number (scalar)
A·B = axbx +ayby +azbz = |A||B|cos(A,B),
where (A,B) is the angle between the vectors A
and B. We can also think of the scalar product
as the projection of, say, A in the direction of B
multiplied by the length of B. If A and B are
perpendicular, their scalar product vanishes. The
magnitude of a vector expressed as a scalar prod-
uct is A = |A| =
√
A · A.
The vector product of the vectors A and B is
a vector
A × B = (aybz −azby)ˆi + (azbx −axbz) ˆj
+ (axby −aybx)ˆk
=

.
This is perpendicular to both A and B. Its length
gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by
A and B. The vector product of parallel vec-
tors is a null vector. The vector product is anti-
commutative:
A × B = −B × A.
Scalar and vector products satisfy the laws of
distributivity:
A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C,

A.5
Matrices
467
A × (B + C) = A × B + A × C,
(A + B) · C = A · C + B · C,
(A + B) × C = A × C + B × C.
A scalar triple product is a scalar

Here the cross and dot can be interchanged and
the factors permuted cyclically without affecting
the value of the product. For example A×B ·C =
B × C · A = B · C × A, but A × B · C = −B ×
A · C.
A vector triple product is a vector, which can
be evaluated using one of the expansions
A × (B × C) = B(A · C) −C(A · B),
(A × B) × C = B(A · C) −A(B · C).
In all these products, scalar factors can be
moved around without affecting the product:
A · kB = k(A · B),
A × (B × kC) = k

A × (B × C)

The position vector of a particle is usually
a function of time r = r(t) = x(t)ˆi + y(t) ˆj +
z(t)ˆk. The velocity of the particle is a vector,
tangent to the trajectory, obtained by taking the
derivative of r with respect to time:
v = d
dt r(t) = ˙r = ˙xˆi + ˙y ˆj + ˙z ˆk.
The acceleration is the second derivative, ¨r.
Derivatives of the various products obey the
same rules as derivatives of products of real-
valued function:
d
dt (A · B) = ˙A · B + A · ˙B,
d
dt (A × B) = ˙A × B + A × ˙B.
When computing a derivative of a vector product,
one must be careful to retain the order of the fac-
tors, since the sign of the vector product changes
if the factors are interchanged.
A.5
Matrices
Assume we have a vector x with components
(x,y,z). We can calculate another vector x′ =
(x′,y′,z′), the components of which are linear
combinations of the original components:
x′ = a11x + a12y + a13z,
y′ = a21x + a22y + a23z,
z′ = a31x + a32y + a33z.
This is a linear transform that maps the vector x
to a vector x′.
We can collect the coefﬁcients to an array,
called a matrix A:
A =
⎛
⎝
a11
a12
a13
a21
a22
a23
a31
a32
a33
⎞
⎠.
A general matrix can consist of an arbitrary num-
ber of rows and columns. In this book we need
only matrices operating on vectors of a three-
dimensional space, and they always have three
rows and columns. Two subscripts refer to the dif-
ferent elements of the matrix, the ﬁrst one giving
the row and the second one the column.
When using matrix formalism it is convenient
to write vectors in the form of column vectors:
A =
⎛
⎝
x
y
z
⎞
⎠.

468
A
Mathematics
We now deﬁne that the product of a matrix and
a column vector
x′ = Ax
or
⎛
⎝
x′
y′
z′
⎞
⎠=
⎛
⎝
a11

a21
a22
a23
a31
a32
a33
⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝

y
z
⎞
⎠
means just
x′ = a11x + a12y + a13z,
y′ = a21x + a22y + a23z,
z′ = a31x + a32y + a33z.
Comparing these equations we see, for example,
that the ﬁrst component of x′ is obtained by tak-
ing the ﬁrst row of the matrix, multiplying the
components of the vector x by the correspond-
ing components of that row, and ﬁnally adding
the products.
This deﬁnition can easily be generalised to the
product of two matrices. The elements of the ma-
trix
C = AB
are
cij =

k
aikbkj.
This is easy to remember by noting that we take
the row i of the ﬁrst factor A and the column j of
the second factor B and evaluate the scalar prod-
uct of the two vectors. For example
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠
=
⎛

⎞
⎠.
When multiplying matrices, we have to be
careful with the order of the factors, because usu-
ally AB ̸= BA. If we multiply the matrices of
the previous example in the reverse order, we get
quite a different result:
⎛
⎝
1
2
0
2
1
1
1
3

⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝

⎠=
⎛
⎝

⎠.
A unit matrix I is a matrix, which has ones on
its diagonal and zeros elsewhere:
I =
⎛
⎝
1
0
0
0
1
0
0
0
1
⎞
⎠.
If a vector or a matrix is multiplied by a unit ma-
trix, it will remain unchanged.
If the product of two matrices is a unit matrix,
the two matrices are inverse matrices of each oth-
ers. The inverse matrix of A is denoted by A−1.
It satisﬁes the equations
A−1A = AA−1 = I.
In spherical astronomy we need mainly rota-
tion matrices, describing the rotation of a coordi-
nate frame. The following matrices correspond to
rotations around the x, y and z axes, respectively:
Rx(α) =
⎛
⎝
1
0
0
0
cosα
sinα
0
−sinα
cosα
⎞
⎠,
Ry(α) =
⎛
⎝
cosα
0
sinα
0
1
0
−sinα
0
cosα
⎞
⎠,
Rz(α) =
⎛
⎝
cosα
sinα
0
−sinα
cosα
0
0
0
1
⎞
⎠.
If the angle is α = 0, only a unit matrix remains.
The elements of a rotation matrix can easily
be determined. For example, a rotation around the
x axis will leave the x coordinate unaffected, and
thus the ﬁrst row and column must be zeroes, ex-
cept for the diagonal element, which must be one.
This will leave four elements. When the angle is
zero, the matrix has to reduce to a unit matrix;
thus the diagonal elements must be cosines and
the other ones sines. The only problem is to de-
cide, which of the sines will get the minus sign.

A.6
Multiple Integrals
469
This is most easily done by testing the effect of
the matrix on some basis vector.
The inverse matrix of a rotation matrix cor-
responds to a rotation in the opposite direction.
Thus it is obtained from the original matrix by
replacing the angle α by −α. The only change
in the matrix is that the signs of the sines are
changed.
For example, the precession matrix is a prod-
uct of three rotation matrices. Since the matrix
product is not commutative, these rotations must
be carried out in the correct order.
A.6
Multiple Integrals
An integral of a function f over a surface A
I =

A
f dA
can be evaluated as a double integral by express-
ing the surface element dA in terms of coordinate
differentials. In rectangular coordinates,
dA = dx dy
and in polar coordinates
dA = r dr dϕ.
The integration limits of the innermost integral
may depend on the other integration variable.
For example, the function xey integrated over the
shaded area is

The surface need not be conﬁned to a plane.
For example, the area of a sphere is

A.7
Numerical Solution
of an Equation
We frequently meet equations defying analyti-
cal solutions. Kepler’s equation is a typical ex-
ample. If we cannot do anything else, we can
always apply some numerical method. Next we
shall present two very simple methods, the ﬁrst
of which is particularly suitable for calculators.
Method 1: Direct Iteration
We shall write the
equation as f (x) = x. Next we have to ﬁnd an
initial value x0 for the solution. This can be
done, for example, graphically or by just guess-
ing. Then we compute a succession of new it-
erates x1 = f (x0), x2 = f (x1), and so on, un-
til the difference of successive solutions becomes
smaller than some preset limit. The last iterate xi
is the solution. After computing a few xi’s, it is
easy to see if they are going to converge. If not,
we rewrite the equation as f −1(x) = x and try
again. (f −1 is the inverse function of f .)
As an example, let us solve the equation x =
−lnx. We guess x0 = 0.5 and ﬁnd
x1 = −ln0.5 = 0.69,
x2 = 0.37,
x3 = 1.00.
This already shows that something is wrong.
Therefore we change our equation to x = e−x and
start again:
x0 = 0.5,
x1 = e−0.5 = 0.61,
x2 = 0.55,
x3 = 0.58,
x4 = 0.56,
x5 = 0.57,
x6 = 0.57.

A.7
Numerical Solution of an Equation
471
Thus the solution, accurate to two decimal places,
is 0.57.
Method 2. Interval Halving
In some patholog-
ical cases the previous method may refuse to con-
verge. In such situations we can use the foolproof
method of interval halving. If the function is con-
tinuous (as most functions of classical physics
are) and we manage to ﬁnd two points x1 and x2
such that f (x1) > 0 and f (x2) < 0, we know
that somewhere between x1 and x2 there must be
a point x in which f (x) = 0. Now we ﬁnd the
sign of f in the midpoint of the interval, and se-
lect the half of the interval in which f changes
sign. We repeat this procedure until the interval
containing the solution is small enough.
We shall try also this method on our equation
x = −lnx, which is now written as f (x) = 0,
where f (x) = x + lnx. Because f (x) →−∞,
when x →0 and f (1) > 0, the solution must be
in the range (0,1). Since f (0.5) < 0, we know
that x ∈(0.5,1). We continue in this way:
f (0.75) > 0
⇒
x ∈(0.5,0.75),
f (0.625) > 0
⇒
x ∈(0.5,0.625),
f (0.563) < 0
⇒
x ∈(0.563,0.625),
f (0.594) > 0
⇒
x ∈(0.563,0.594).
The convergence is slow but certain. Each iter-
ation restricts the solution to an interval which is
half as large as the previous one, thus improving
the solution by one binary digit.

B
Theory of Relativity
Albert Einstein published his special theory of
relativity in 1905 and the general theory of rel-
ativity ten years later. Especially the general the-
ory, which is essentially a gravitation theory, has
turned out to be very important for the theories of
the evolution of the Universe. Therefore it is ap-
propriate to consider here some basic principles
of relativity theory. A more detailed discussion
would require sophisticated mathematics, and is
beyond the scope of this very elementary book.
B.1
Basic Concepts
Everyone knows the famous Pythagorean theo-
rem
s2 = x2 + y2,
where s is the length of the hypotenuse of
a right-angle triangle, and x and y are the
lengths of the other two sides. (For brevity, we
have denoted s2 = (s)2.) This is easily gener-
alised to three dimensions:
s2 = x2 + y2 + z2.
This equation describes the metric of an ordinary
rectangular frame in a Euclidean space, i.e. tells
us how to measure distances.
Generally the expression for the distance be-
tween two points depends on the exact location
of the points. In such a case the metric must be
expressed in terms of inﬁnitesimal distances in
order to correctly take into account the curva-
ture of the coordinate curves. (A coordinate curve
is a curve along which one coordinate changes
while all the others remain constant.) An in-
ﬁnitesimal distance ds is called the line element.
In a rectangular frame of a Euclidean space it is
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2,
and in spherical coordinates
ds2 = dr2 + r2
dθ2 + cos2 θ dφ2
.
Generally ds2 can be expressed as
ds2 =

i,j
gij dxi dxj,
where the xi’s are arbitrary coordinates, and the
coefﬁcients gij are components of the metric ten-
sor. These can be functions of the coordinates,
as in the case of the spherical coordinates. The
metric tensor of an n-dimensional space can be
expressed as an n × n matrix. Since dxi dxj =
dxjdxi, the metric tensor is symmetric, i.e. gij =
gji. If all coordinate curves intersect perpendic-
ularly, the coordinate frame is orthogonal. In an
orthogonal frame, gij = 0 for all i ̸= j. For exam-
ple, the spherical coordinates form an orthogonal
frame, the metric tensor of which is
(gij) =
⎛
⎝
1
0
0
0
r2
0
0
0
r2 cos2 θ
⎞
⎠.
If it is possible to ﬁnd a frame in which all the
components of g are constant, the space is ﬂat.

Theory of Relativity
we have g11 = g22 = g33 = 1; hence the space
is ﬂat. The spherical coordinates show that even
in a ﬂat space, we can use frames in which the
components of the metric tensor are not constant.
The line element of a two-dimensional spherical
surface is obtained from the metric of the spheri-
cal coordinate frame by assigning to r some ﬁxed
value R:
ds2 = R2
dθ2 + cos2 θ dφ2
.
The metric tensor is
(gij) =
1
0
0
cos2 φ

.
This cannot be transformed to a constant tensor.
Thus the surface of a sphere is a curved space.
If we know the metric tensor in some frame,
we can compute a fourth-order tensor, the curva-
ture tensor Rijkl, which tells us whether the space
is curved or ﬂat. Unfortunately the calculations
are slightly too laborious to be presented here.
The metric tensor is needed for all computa-
tions involving distances, magnitudes of vectors,
areas, and so on. Also, to evaluate a scalar prod-
uct, we must know the metric. In fact the com-
ponents of the metric tensor can be expressed as
scalar products of the basis vectors:
gij = ˆei · ˆej.
If A and B are two arbitrary vectors
A =

B.2
Lorentz Transformation.
Minkowski Space
The special theory of relativity abandoned the ab-
solute Newtonian time, supposed to ﬂow at the
same rate for every observer. Instead it required
that the speed of light must have the same value c
in all coordinate frames. The constancy of the
speed of light follows immediately from the ba-
sic assumptions of the special theory of relativity.
This is possible only if different observers mea-
sure time intervals differently.
Let us send a beam of light from the origin. It
travels along a straight line at the speed c. Thus,
at the moment t its space and time coordinates
satisfy the equation
x2 + y2 + z2 = c2t2.
(B.1)
Next we study what the situation looks like in an-
other frame, x′y′z′, moving at a velocity v with
respect to the xyz frame. Let us select the new
frame so that it coincides with the xyz frame
at t = 0. Also, let the time coordinate t′ of the
x′y′z′ frame be t′ = 0 when t = 0. And ﬁnally we
assume that the x′y′z′ frame moves in the direc-
tion of the positive x axis. Since the beam of light
must also travel at the speed c in the x′y′z′ frame,
we must have
x′2 + y′2 + z′2 = c2t′2.
If we require that the new (dashed) coordinates
be obtained from the old ones by a linear trans-
formation, and also that the inverse transforma-
tion be obtained simply by replacing v by −v,
we ﬁnd that the transformation must be
x′ =
x −vt

1 −v2/c2 ,
y′ = y,
z′ = z,
t′ = t −vx/c2

1 −v2/c2 .
(B.2)
This transformation between frames moving at
a constant speed with respect to each other is
called the Lorentz transformation.
Because the Lorentz transformation is derived
assuming the invariance of (B.1), it is obvious
that the interval
s2 = −c2t2 + x2 + y2 + z2
of any two events remains invariant in all Lorentz
transformations. This interval deﬁnes a metric in

four-dimensional spacetime. A space having such
a metric is called the Minkowski space or Lorentz
space. The components of the metric tensor g are
(gij) =

⎟⎟⎠.
Since this is constant, the space is ﬂat. But it is
no longer an ordinary Euclidean space, because
the sign of the time component differs from the
sign of the space components. In the older litera-
ture, a variable ict is often used instead of time,
i being the imaginary unit. Then the metric looks
Euclidean, which is misleading; the properties of
the space cannot be changed just by changing no-
tation.
In a Minkowski space position, velocity, mo-
mentum and other vector quantities are described
by four-vectors, which have one time and three
space components. The components of a four-
vector obey the Lorentz transformation when we
transform them from one frame to another, both
moving along a straight line at a constant speed.
According to classical physics the distance of
two events depends on the motion of the observer,
but the time interval between the events is the
same for all observers. The world of special rel-
ativity is more anarchistic: even time intervals
have different values for different observers.
B.3
General Relativity
The Equivalence Principle
Newton’s laws re-
late the acceleration, a, of a particle and the ap-
plied force F by
F = mia,
where mi is the inertial mass of the particle, re-
sisting the force trying to move the particle. The
gravitational force felt by the particle is
F = mgf,
where mg is the gravitational mass of the particle,
and f is a factor depending only on other masses.
The masses mi and mg appear as coefﬁcients re-
lated to totally different phenomena. There is no
physical reason to assume that the two masses
should have anything in common. However, al-
ready the experiments made by Galilei showed
that evidently mi = mg. This has been veriﬁed
later with very high accuracy.
The weak equivalence principle, which states
that mi = mg, can therefore be accepted as
a physical axiom. The strong equivalence prin-
ciple generalises this: if we restrict our observa-
tions to a sufﬁciently small region of spacetime,
there is no way to tell whether we are subject to
a gravitational ﬁeld or are in uniformly acceler-
ated motion. The strong equivalence principle is
one of the fundamental postulates of general rel-
ativity.
Curvature of Space
General relativity descri-
bes gravitation as a geometric property of the
spacetime. The equivalence principle is an ob-
vious consequence of this idea. Particles mov-
ing through spacetime follow the shortest possi-
ble paths, geodesics. The projection of a geodesic
onto a three-dimensional space need not be the
shortest way between the points.
The geometry of spacetime is determined by
the mass and energy distribution. If this distribu-
tion is known, we can write the ﬁeld equations,
which are partial differential equations connect-
ing the metric to the mass and energy distribution
and describing the curvature of spacetime.
In the case of a single-point mass, the ﬁeld
equations yield the Schwarzschild metric, the line
element of which is

Here M is the mass of the point; r, θ and φ are or-
dinary spherical coordinates. It can be shown that
the components cannot be transformed to con-
stants simultaneously: spacetime must be curved
due to the mass.
If we study a very small region of spacetime,
the curvature has little effect. Locally the space is
always a Minkowski space where special relativ-
ity can be used. Locality means not only a limited
spatial volume but also a limited interval in time.

Theory of Relativity
Unlike in the Newtonian formalism in general
relativity there are no equations of motion de-
scribing the motion of a particle. It is possible
to use the positions of the bodies to compute the
metric tensor of the space and then the geodesics
representing the orbits of the bodies. When the
bodies are moving, the metric of the space keeps
changing, and thus this method is very laborious.
The PPN (Parametrised Post-Newtonian) formal-
ism has been developed for practical calculations,
yielding approximate equations of motion. It con-
tains ten constants, the values of which are spe-
ciﬁc for Einstein’s theory of gravity. Alternative
theories give different values for these constants.
The formalism therefore provides a framework
for experimental tests of general relativity.
The PPN formalism is an approximation that
can be used if velocities are well below the speed
of light and the gravitational ﬁeld is weak and
hence the curvature of the space is low.
B.4
Tests of General Relativity
General relativity gives predictions different from
classical physics. Although the differences are
usually very small, there are some phenomena in
which the deviation can be measured and used to
test the validity of general relativity. At presents
ﬁve different astronomical tests have veriﬁed the
theory.
First of all the orbit of a planet is no longer
a closed Keplerian eclipse. The effect is strongest
for the innermost planets, whose perihelia should
turn little by little. Most of the motion of the peri-
helion of Mercury is predicted by Newtonian me-
chanics; only a small excess of 43 arc seconds
per century remains unexplained. And it so hap-
pens that this is exactly the correction suggested
by general relativity.
Secondly a beam of light should bend when
it travels close to the Sun. For a beam grazing
the surface, the deviation should be about 1.75′′.
Such effects have been observed during total so-
lar eclipses and also by observing pointlike radio
sources, just before and after occultation by the
Sun.
The third classical way of testing general rela-
tivity is to measure the redshift of a photon climb-
ing in a gravitational ﬁeld. We can understand
the redshift as an energy loss while the photon
does work against the gravitational potential. Or
we can think of the redshift as caused by the
metric only: a distant observer ﬁnds that near
a mass, time runs slower, and the frequency of
the radiation is lower. The time dilation in the
Schwarzschild metric is described by the coefﬁ-
cient of dt; thus it is not surprising that the radi-
ation emitted at a frequency ν from a distance r
from a mass M has the frequency
ν∞= ν

1 −2GM
c2r ,
(B.3)
if observed very far from the source. This grav-
itational redshift has been veriﬁed by laboratory
experiments.
The fourth test employs the slowing down of
the speed of light in a gravitational ﬁeld near the
Sun. This has been veriﬁed by radar experiments.
The previous tests concern the solar system.
Outside the solar system binary pulsars have been
used to test general relativity. An asymmetric sys-
tem in accelerated motion (like a binary star)
loses energy as it radiates gravitational waves. It
follows that the components approach each other,
and the period decreases. Usually the gravita-
tional waves play a minor role, but in the case of
a compact source the effect may be strong enough
to be observed. The ﬁrst source to show this pre-
dicted shortening of period was the binary pulsar
PSR 1913+16.

the expressions used in the Astronomical Almanac. They
give the magnitudes as functions of the phase angle α. In-
terior planets can be observed at relatively large phase an-
gles, and thus several terms are needed to describe their
phase curves. Phase angles of the exterior planets are al-
ways small, and thus very simple expressions are sufﬁ-
cient. The magnitude of Saturn means the magnitude of
the planet only; the total magnitude also depends on the
orientation of the rings

Table C.16 Periodic comets with several perihelion
passages observed. N = number of passages observed,
τ = time of perihelion passage, P = sidereal period,
q = perihelion distance, e = eccentricity, ω = argument
of perihelion (1950.0), Ω = longitude of ascending node
(1950.0), i = inclination, l = longitude of perihelion, de-
ﬁned here as l = Ω + arctan(tanω cosi), b = latitude of
perihelion (sinb = sinω sini), Q = aphelion distance. The
elements are affected by planetary perturbations as well
as reaction forces due to evaporating material the amount
of which is difﬁcult to predict

Answers to Exercises
Chapter 2
2.1 The distance is ≈7640 km, the northern-
most point is 79◦N, 45◦W, in North Greenland,
1250 km from the North Pole.
2.2 The star can culminate south or north of
zenith. In the former case we get δ = 65◦, φ =
70◦, and in the latter δ = 70◦, φ = 65◦.
2.3 (a) φ > 58◦7′. If refraction is taken into ac-
count, the limit is 57◦24′. (b) φ = δ = 7◦24′.
(c) −59◦10′ ≤φ ≤−0◦50′.
2.4 Pretty bad.
2.5 λ⊙= 70◦22′, β⊙= 0◦0′, λ⊕= 250◦22′,
β⊕= 0◦0′.
2.6 (c) Θ0 = 18 h.
2.8 α = 6 h 45 min 9 s, δ = −16◦43′.
2.9 vt = 16.7 kms−1, v = 18.5 kms−1, after ≈
61,000 years. μ = 1.62′′ per year, parallax 0.42′′.
Chapter 3
3.1 (a) The ﬂux density in the focal plane as well
as the exposure time are proportional to (D/f )2.
Thus the required exposure is 3.2 s. (b) 1.35 cm
and 1.80 cm. (c) 60 and 80.
3.2 (a) 0.001′′ (note that the aperture is a line
rather than circular; therefore the coefﬁcient 1.22
should not be used). (b) 140 m.
Chapter 4
4.1 0.9.
4.2 The absolute magnitude will be −17.5 and
apparent 6.7.
4.3 N(m + 1)/N(m) = 103/5 = 3.98.
4.4 r = 2.1 kpc, EB−V = 0.7, and (B −V )0 =
0.9.
4.5 (a) m = 1.06 mag, m = 2.42. (b) τ =
−ln0.856 ≈0.98.
Chapter 5
5.2 n = 166, which corresponds to λ = 21.04 cm.
Such transitions would keep the population of the
state n = 166 very high, resulting in downward
transitions also from this state. Such transitions
have not been detected. Hence, the line is pro-
duced by some other process.
5.3 If we express the intensity as something per
unit wavelength, we get λmax = 1.1 mm. If the
intensity is given per unit frequency, we have
λmax = 1.9 mm. The total intensity is 2.6 ×
1013 Wm−2 sterad−1. At 550 nm the intensity is
practically zero.

Answers to Exercises
5.4 (a) L = 1.35 × 1029 W. The ﬂux in the given
interval can be found by integrating Planck’s
law numerically. Using the Wien approximation
a rather complicated expression can be derived.
Both methods give the result that 3.3 % of the ra-
diation is in the visual range, thus LV = 4.45 ×
1027 W. (b) At a distance of 10 pc the observed
ﬂux density is 3.7 × 10−9 Wm−2. (b) 10.3 km.
5.5 Mbol = 0.87, whence R = 2.0R⊙.
5.6 T = 1380 K. There are several strong ab-
sorption lines in this spectral region, reducing the
brightness temperature.
5.8 vrms ≈6700 kms−1.
Chapter 6
6.1 va/vp = (1 −e)/(1 + e). For the Earth this
is 0.97.
6.2 a = 1.4581 AU, v ≈23.6 kms−1.
6.3 The period must equal the sidereal rotation
period of the Earth. r = 42,339 km = 6.64R⊕.
Areas within 8.6◦from the poles cannot be seen
from geostationary satellites. The hidden area is
1.1 % of the total surface area.
6.4 ρ = 3π/(GP 2(α/2)3) ≈1400 kgm−3.
6.5 M = 90◦, E = 90.96◦, f = 91.91◦.
6.6 The orbit is hyperbolic, a = 3.55 × 107 AU,
e = 1 + 3.97 × 10−16, rp = 2.1 km. The comet
will hit the Sun.
6.7 The orbital elements of the Earth calculated
from Table C.12 are a = 1.0000, e = 0.0167,
i = 0.0004◦, Ω = −11.13◦, ϖ = 102.9◦, L =
219.5◦. The geocentric radius vector of the Sun
in the ecliptic coordinates is
r =
⎛
⎝
0.7583
0.6673
0.0
⎞
⎠.
The corresponding equatorial radius vector is
r =
⎛
⎝
0.7583
0.6089
0.2640
⎞
⎠,
which gives α ≈2 h 35 min 3 s, δ ≈15.19◦.
The exact direction is α = 2 h 34 min 53 s, δ =
15.17◦.
Chapter 7
7.1 Assuming the orbits are circular, the greatest
elongation is arcsin(a/1 AU). For Mercury this
is 23◦and for Venus 46◦. The elongation of a su-
perior planet can be anything up to 180◦. The sky
revolves about 15◦per hour, and thus correspond-
ing times for Mercury and Venus are 1 h 30 min
and 3 h 5 min, respectively. In opposition Mars is
visible the whole night. These values, however,
depend on the actual declinations of the planets.
7.2 (a) 8.7◦. (b) The Earth must be 90◦from
the ascending node of Venus, which is the situ-
ation about 13 days before vernal and autumnal
equinoxes, around March 8 and September 10.
7.3 (a) If the radii of the orbits are a1 and a2, the
angular velocity of the retrograde motion is
dλ
dt =
√
GM
√a1a2(√a1 + √a2).
(b) In six days Pluto moves about 0.128◦corre-
sponding to 4 mm. For a main belt asteroid the
displacement is almost 4 cm.
7.4 If the orbital velocity of the planet is v the
deviation in radians is
α = v
c = 1
c

GM⊙
a
.
This is greatest for Mercury, α = 0.00016 rad =
33′′. This planetary aberration must be taken into
account when computing accurate ephemerides.
The deviation is largest when the planet is in con-
junction or opposition and moves almost perpen-
dicularly to the line of sight.

7.5 p = 0.11, q = 2, and A = 0.2. In reality the
Moon reﬂects most of the light directly back-
wards (opposition effect), and thus q and A are
much smaller.
7.6 m = 0.9. The surface brightness remains
constant.
7.7 The absolute magnitude is V (1,0) = 23.
(a) m = 18.7. (b) m = 14.2. At least a 15 cm tele-
scope is needed to detect the asteroid even one
day before the collision.
7.8 Using the values of Appendix C, the gravita-
tional acceleration is 9.865 m/s2 at the poles and
9.799 m/s2 on the equator. On the equator then
rotational velocity is 464 m/s and the centrifugal
acceleration 0.034 m/s2; thus the total accelera-
tion is on 9.765 m/s2.
Chapter 8
8.1 Psid = 11.9 a, a = 5.20 AU, d = 144,000 km.
Obviously the planet is Jupiter.
8.2 (a) Hint: If there is a synodic period P there
must be integers p and q such that (n2 −n1)P =
2πp and (n3 −n1)P = 2πq. Sometimes one can
see claims that the conﬁguration of the whole
planetary system will recur after a certain period.
Such claims are obviously nonsense. (b) 7.06 d.
8.3 Apply (7.1), where now P1 = 24.62 and
P2 = 30.30. Hence P1,2 = 131.34 h = 5 d 11 h
20 min. One revolution as seen from the surface
of Mars takes 131.34 hours. Thus Deimos seems
to move 360/131.34 = 2.74 degrees an hour.
8.4
According to Example 8.1 the distance of
the Roche limit is R ≈2.5 × R, where R is the
radius of the planet. The following table gives the

The nearest satellites and inner edges of rings

The mass of hydrogen atoms that could be packed
in one cubic metre is (1/5.5 × 10−11)3 × 1.67 ×
10−27 × 0.74 = 7428 kg. The density of Jupiter
calculated this way would be 7428 kg/m3. The
actual density is only 1326 kg/m3.

10.1 The period is P = 1/

2 years and the rela-
tive velocity 42,100 ms−1. The maximum sepa-
ration of the lines is 0.061 nm.
10.3 Substituting the values to the equation of
Example 10.1 we get an equation for a. The so-
lution is a = 4.4 AU. The mass of the planet is
0.0015M⊙.

0.0012 nm.

16.1 2.6 kpc and 0.9 kpc, a = 1.5 mag/kpc.
16.2 7 kms−1.
16.3 The velocity of the proton is v = 0.0462c =
1.38 × 107 ms−1. The radius of the orbit is r =
mv/qB = 0.01 AU.
Chapter 17
17.1 7.3.
17.2 The potential energy is approximately U =
−G(m2n2/(2R)), where m is the mass of one
star, n the number of stars (there are n(n −
1)/2 ≈n2/2 pairs), and R the radius of the clus-
ter. The average velocity is ≈√Gmn/(2R) =
0.5 kms−1.
Chapter 18
18.1 μ = 0.0055′′ a−1.
18.2 (a) 5.7 kpc. (b) 11 kpc. Possible reasons
for the discrepancy include: (1) The distance is
so large that the approximations used for deriv-
ing Oort’s formulae are not very good. (2) Taking
into account the interstellar extinction will reduce
the distance in (b). (3) The peculiar velocity of the
star was neglected.
18.3 (a) 3 (and the Sun). (b) The number is of the
order of 100,000. This is a typical selection ef-
fect: bright stars are rare but they are visible overt
long distances.
18.4 (a) If the thickness of the disk is H, the light
has to travel a distance s = min{r,(H/2)secb} in
the interstellar medium. Thus the magnitude will
be m = M + 5lg(r/10 pc) + as. (b) s = 200 pc,
m = 10.2.

Answers to Exercises

Chapter 19
19.1 (a) 26, (b) 25.
19.2 The diameter must be of the order one light-
week ≈1200 AU. M = −23.5. If this is the
bolometric magnitude, the luminosity is L ≈2 ×
1011 L⊙, corresponding to 210L⊙AU−3.
Chapter 20
20.1 r = v/H = 93 Mpc (if H = 75), diameter
is 35 kpc, M = −20.4. Potential sources of error
include: (1) inaccuracy of the Hubble constant,
(2) peculiar velocity of the galaxy, (3) intergalac-
tic extinction, (4) only 2-dimensional projection
is observed, and the edge depends on the limiting
magnitude used.
20.2 If H = 50 kms−1 Mpc−1, r = 51 Mpc, or
74 times the distance of M31. If H is doubled,
the distance is reduced to half of that, but is still
higher than the value obtained in Exercise 19.1.
A possible explanation is the peculiar velocity of
the galaxy.
20.3 mν = 1.5 × 10−35 kg, or 0.00002 times the
mass of the electron.
Chapter 21
21.1 If the greenhouse effect is neglected, the
distances corresponding to temperatures 373 K
and 273 K are 0.47 AU and 0.87 AU, respec-
tively. The effective temperature of the young Sun
was T =
4√
0.7 × 5785 K = 5291 K. The corre-
sponding limits then were 0.39 AU and 0.73 AU.
Thus the continuously habitable zone would ex-
tend from 0.47 to 0.73 AU.
21.2 If there are n stars in a volume V , the dis-
tance between the nearest neighbours is of the or-
der
3√V/n. If binary and triple stars in Table C.17
are counted as single objects, there are 47 stars
in a volume of 520 cubic parsecs. (a) If a frac-
tion 0.01 of them is habited, the average distance
between neighbouring civilisations is 10 parsecs;
(b) 100 parsecs.
21.3 Since comets are mostly dirty ice, the den-
sity is close to that of water. Thus the mass of the
comet is about 5 × 108 kg. A freely falling ob-
ject will reach a velocity that is the same as the
escape velocity from the Earth, 11 km/s. The ki-
netic energy of the comet is at least 3 × 1016 J,
corresponding to 7.6 megatons of TNT or 500 Hi-
roshima bombs.
Chapter 22
22.1 The centre of gravity of the Sun and Jupiter
is about 743,000 km from the centre of the Sun,
i.e. somewhat outside the solar surface. From a
distance of 10 pc this subtends an angle of 0.0005
arcsecond. Thus the total amount of oscillation is
one milliarcsecond.
22.2 Jupiter covers a fraction 0.0106 of the so-
lar disc, corresponding to 0.0115 magnitudes. For
the Earth the change is 0.0001 magnitudes.

bright regions. The wavelength of 8 microme-
ters has been coded red, and 5.8 microns, orange.
They represent dust heated by the stars. Light
of 4.5 microns (green) shows hot gas and dust,
and light of 3.6 microns (blue) is from starlight.

Plate 21 The dark cloud Barnard 68 in the con-
stellation of Ophiuchus. B68 is a dense molecu-
lar cloud, which is just starting to contract and
later form new stars. The diameter of the cloud
is 7 light-months (0.2 parsecs), and its distance is
about 500 light-years. It was photographed by the
Antu (VLT 1) Telescope in 1999. (Photo ESO)
Plate 22 The star V838 Monocerotis brightened
suddenly in early 2002. The outburst lasted sev-
eral weeks and sent a sphere of light spread-
ing into the surrounding interstellar medium. The
light-echo has illuminated the dust clouds around
the star and unveiled never-before-seen patterns.
This photo was taken by the Hubble Space Tele-
scope at the end of 2004, nearly three years after
the outburst. (Photo NASA/ESA)
Plate 23 The Rosette Nebula in Monoceros be-
longs to the same extensive dust and gas complex
as the Orion Nebula. Within the Rosette Nebula
there is a young star cluster called NGC 2244,
which gives energy to the cloud. The ultraviolet
light from the stars makes the hydrogen glow red,
and the oxygen, greenish. The picture is about 1
degree wide, and it was taken by the MegaPrime
Camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
on Mauna Kea in 2003. (Photo CFHT/J.-C. Cuil-
landre)
Plate 24 The Helix Nebula is one of the nearest
planetary nebulae and also one of the apparently
widest. Its diameter is nearly one degree (two full
Moons side by side), but its surface brightness is
so low it cannot be seen by the naked eye. It is lo-
cated in the constellation of Aquarius. This com-
posite photograph combines an ultra-sharp mo-
saic by the Hubble Space Telescope with a wide
view by the WIYN 0.9 meter Telescope on Kitt
Peak. (Photo NASA/NOAO/ESA)
Plate 25
Radio image of the Cassiopeia A su-
pernova remnant. Cas A is one of the bright-
est radio sources in the sky. This image was
made at three different frequencies: 1.4 GHz,
5.0 GHz and 8.4 GHz, with the Very Large Ar-
ray radio telescope in New Mexico. The radiation
comes mainly from relativistic electrons. (Image
NRAO/AUI)
Plate 26
The remnant of the Tycho supernova
in X-rays. The supernova exploded in 1572 and
was observed by Tycho Brahe. During the last
years, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory has made
observations of this object. The image shows an
expanding bubble of extremely hot gas (in green
and red) inside a shell of rapidly moving elec-
trons (blue). (Image NASA/Chandra)
Chapter 19. Galaxies
Plate 27
Part of the Andromeda Galaxy M31,
photographed with the Japanese Subaru 8.4 m
telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The nucleus of
the galaxy is outside the picture on the upper left.
The stars with the vertical lines are foreground
stars in our Milky Way. M31 is a sister galaxy
to our Milky Way, with similar star clusters, dust
and gas clouds and spiral arms. (Photo Subaru
Telescope, NOAJ)
Plate 28
The most detailed infrared view of
the Andromeda Galaxy so far was obtained by
the Spitzer Telescope in 2004. While the Sub-
aru picture (Plate 27) shows the starlight from
the galaxy, the Spitzer picture records the infrared
radiation from the dust in the spiral arms at the
wavelength of 24 micrometers. The spiral arms

with their warm dust and star-forming clouds can
be seen much more clearly than at visual wave-
lengths. (Photo Spitzer/NASA)
Plate 29
The central part of the active galaxy
Centaurus A, NGC 5128, seen by the Hubble
Space Telescope. The whole galaxy is crossed by
a thick dust lane with intricate wisps of warm
dust and gas. At the centre of the galaxy, behind
the dust shroud, lies a black hole, which sends
powerful jets in two directions. The jets can be
seen only in X-rays or at radio wavelengths. For
a wider view of Centaurus A see the next Plate.
(Photo NASA)
Plate 30
New pictures of the outer parts of
Centaurus A have revealed several ring-like fea-
tures, which contain faint blue stars. The rings
may have been formed in interactions with other,
smaller galaxies, which have collided with Cen-
taurus A and lost part of their stars to this giant
galaxy. (Photo Cerro Tololo International Obser-
vatory, NOAO/NSF)
Plate 31
A well-known galaxy-quasar pair: in
the center the galaxy NGC 4319, and on the up-
per right, the quasar Markarian 215. Although the
pair seems to belong together, in reality this is
a case of chance alignment. The distance to the
quasar is 14 times larger than the distance to the
galaxy. (Photo Hubble Space Telescope/NASA)
Plate 32
A small group of interacting galax-
ies called Seyfert’s Sextet. As the name implies,
there seem to be six galaxies engaging in a cos-
mic dance. The number of interacting galaxies is
however only four. The small well-deﬁned spiral
galaxy to the right of the center, lies nearly ﬁve
times further away than the others. And the right-
most “galaxy” isn’t actually a galaxy at all, but
a long “tidal tail” of stars torn off from the other
galaxies. (Photo Hubble Space Telescope/NASA)
Chapter 20. Cosmology
Plate 33 The Hubble Space Telescope has pho-
tographed several deep sky ﬁelds to get represen-
tative samples of the Universe. This photograph is
the Hubble Deep Field South in the constellation
Tucana, and it contains thousands of never-before
seen galaxies up to the distance of 12 Ga. The
small red dot in the middle of the photograph is
a distant quasar, whose light was studied with the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, to map
invisible clouds of hydrogen gas between us and
the quasar. (Photo NASA)
Plate 34 Temperature ﬂuctuations in the cosmic
microwave background. The observations were
made with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) in 2002. From the scale depen-
dence of the ﬂuctuations we can estimate the av-
erage density of the Universe (very near the crit-
ical density), and the age of the Universe (about
13.7 Ga). (Photo WMAP/NASA)
