Foreword
Mixed Messages: Using the Bible and Qurʾān in Swahili tracts is the result of 
many years’ interest in how tracts are used in East Africa, starting when I lived 
in Tanzania and subsequently Kenya. This interest led to research on tracts 
in Swahili, in ‘Muslim Affirmation through Refutation, a Tanzanian example’ 
(MA Diss. University of Birmingham, 1999) and ‘The use of Scripture in Swahili 
Tracts by Muslims and Christians in East Africa’ (PhD Diss. University of 
Birmingham, 2008). The book draws on this and subsequent research explor-
ing how scripture is used in tracts.
My thanks go to many people who have helped and supported me through 
the process of writing the book:
The tract sellers in Kenya and Tanzania who were happy to show me tracts 
and to talk with me about them;
Librarians and archivists at the following libraries whose assistance has been 
invaluable: St Paul’s University, Limuru; University of Birmingham, Edgbaston 
campus and the Orchard Learning Resource Centre, Selly Oak; School of 
Oriental and African Studies, London University; Rhodes House Library, 
University of Oxford; Edinburgh University and University of Bayreuth.
Colleagues and former students at St Philip’s Theological College, Kongwa, 
Tanzania and St Paul’s University, Limuru, Kenya, especially Esther Mombo, 
Joseph Galgalo, and Johnson Mbillah, former General Adviser for the 
Programme for Christian-Muslim Relations in Africa (PROCMURA); the Junior 
Scholars involved in the ‘Sharia Debates and Their Perception by Christians 
and Muslims in Selected African Countries Project’ and Franz Kogelmann, 
University of Bayreuth for their help and encouragement; Colleagues at the 
Centre for Muslim-Christian Studies, Oxford and colleagues working with me 
on the Christian-Muslim Relations. A Bibliographical History 1500–1900 pro-
ject; the late Sigvard von Sicard, my mentor and supervisor; Louise Buglass 
for the Map. Phyll Chesworth for the tremendous support she has given me, 
spending many hours patiently correcting my English and discussing the 
Swahili translations with me.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Mixed Messages: Using the Bible and Qurʾān in Swahili Tracts gives an over-
view of how Swahili has been used in religious tracts in East Africa during 
the long twentieth century. The competition between two missionary faiths, 
Christianity and Islam, gave rise to the publication and distribution of short 
booklets. In these, verses of scripture, from both the Bible and the Qurʾān, were 
used to promote the truth claims of either faith, often whilst seeking to refute 
the other faith.
Why ‘mixed messages’? Christianity and Islam are in competition with each 
other, with both faiths wanting to ‘win’ more followers. The writers of the tracts 
are seeking to gain advantage through the use of each other’s scriptures, in 
order to clearly demonstrate the superiority of their own faith. Readers are 
shown the superiority of one faith through denigration of the other faith. This 
results in ‘mixed messages’ where scripture is misinterpreted whether through 
ignorance or deliberately.
The book reviews the history of the use of tracts in East Africa and exam-
ines how Swahili versions of the Bible and Qurʾān were used in these tracts. 
Understanding of the past allows for an in-depth examination of tracts that 
were in circulation at the turn of the twentieth century. The book also exam-
ines what is known about the writing and production of the tracts and, through 
an analysis of selected passages of scripture used in the tracts, considers how 
these passages are differently interpreted by Christians and Muslims to pro-
mote their own faith.

Start of Interest in Tracts
When walking around any East African town on Fridays, as you reach the 
area near the main Mosque you will find stalls selling many different things 
related to Islam, be it prayer hats or DVD s of sermons. Amongst the items on 
sale there will be booklets. Likewise, when attending church on Sundays, often 
there will be a bookstall which will include a selection of booklets for sale. 
These booklets are often sold for a very low price or may be given away free 
by the stall-holder.

Chapter 1
The booklets, which can also be called tracts, tend to be short and to serve a 
specific purpose of informing and challenging the reader about an issue.
The subject matter of these booklets often concerns basic teachings about 
the faith and belief of the Mosque or Church; it may be specifically denomina-
tional, or may be theological or spiritual in nature. Amongst the booklets there 
may well be ones that relate to other faiths. These can be explanations of how 
to live with our neighbour of a different faith or they may be presenting ways 
of reaching members of the other faith in order to convert them.
Many of the booklets are in English, particularly in Kenya and Uganda; 
however, others are printed in a local vernacular, especially Swahili, which is 
an official ‘national language’ in Kenya and Tanzania. Often the booklets in 
Swahili are translated either from European or Asian languages, but increas-
ingly they are being written locally in Swahili and occasionally also translated 
into other languages.
In early 1990, when living in Tanzania and working at a theological college, 
a locally-produced tract was sent to the college. It used passages from the Bible 
to show why Christianity was false and to demonstrate that Islam was the true 
religion. The anonymous tract Sisi ni wasomaji wakudumu … (We are constant 
readers …) was written in response to various Christian publications circu-
lating in Tanzania in the late 1980s. Three of these are named, including Isa 
(Yesu Kristo) Ndani ya Qur’an na Biblia (Isa (Jesus Christ) in the Qurʾān and 
the Bible) produced by the Tanzania Evangelical Literature Ministry (TELM), 
which is examined in detail in chapter 7. The tract makes a series of statements 
about Christianity and the Apostle Paul, followed by Bible references, used to 
show that Christians have been misled. The tract claims that Jesus’s true mes-
sage had been hidden from Christians; if they had known it, they would be 
Muslims, rather than followers of Paul. A copy of the tract, together with an 
annotated translation, is given in Appendix 2.
It was the study of that tract which led onto further research and the dis-
covery of the range of material, using both the Bible and the Qurʾān, available 
to both Muslims and Christians. That research led to the writing of this book.
Muslim and Christians have used the Bible and the Qurʾān in their preach-
ing and writing to convince each other of the unique truth of their own faith. 
The ways in which scripture is used in the tracts gives mixed messages, in that 
scripture, both the Bible and the Qurʾān, is used to support the truth claims of 
each faith, often whilst denigrating the faith of the ‘other’. The scripture of the 
‘other’ is at times affirmed and shown respect, whilst at other times it is por-
trayed as flawed and incorrect.
With the passage of time, since the tracts were collected and analysed, 
much has changed, especially in the ways that material is disseminated. The

Introduction
growth of the internet and social media means that the situation is much more 
dynamic. Most of the material examined is now more readily available through 
the internet, together with interpretations and misinterpretations from within 
East Africa as well as from around the world.
2	
Interaction and Outreach of the Two Faiths
As we live in an increasingly pluralistic society, an understanding of the 
inter-relationship between different faiths is becoming more important. If 
faith groups are to live together harmoniously it is necessary for them to be 
able to understand each other. When two faiths such as Islam and Christianity 
exist side by side, both of which are ‘missionary religions’ with scriptural 
imperatives to share their faith with others, it is important to understand how 
they conduct that outreach towards each other.
For Muslims this is daʿwa, inviting or calling others to the faith. Several 
verses can be cited from the Qurʾān to show the purpose of daʿwa, such as 
Al-Naḥl (16):125,1 where Muḥammad was told:
[Prophet], call [people] to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good 
teaching. Argue with them in the most courteous way, for your Lord 
knows best who has strayed from His way and who is rightly guided.
The need to conduct daʿwa is explained in Al-Baqara (2):143:
We have made you [believers] into a just community, so that you may bear 
witness [to the truth] before others and so that the Messenger may bear 
witness [to it] before you. We only made the direction the one you used 
to face [Prophet] in order to distinguish those who follow the Messenger 
from those who turn on their heels: that test was hard, except for those 
God has guided. God would never let your faith go to waste [believers], 
for God is most compassionate and most merciful towards people.
And Āl ʿImrān (3):104:
Be a community that calls for what is good, urges what is right, and for-
bids what is wrong: those who do this are the succesful ones.

Chapter 1
For Christians this is euangelizō (evangelism), telling others the ‘good news’ 
of Christ. Several verses of the Bible show the purpose of evangelism, such as 
Matthew 28:19–202 where Jesus addressed his disciples telling them to:
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them all in the 
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching 
them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I 
am with you always, to the end of the age.
One of the methods that both faiths have used to reach out to tell others is 
through literature. Such literature often uses scripture to present persuasive 
reasons as to why one faith is the correct one and why followers of the other 
faith are mistaken.
Hugh Goddard in Muslim Perceptions of Christianity (1996) reviewed litera-
ture written by Muslims in Egypt concerning Christianity and Christians. He 
distinguished between the different approaches, classifying them on a scale 
between Polemical and Eirenical.
Kate Zebiri in Muslims and Christians Face to Face (1997) gave an analysis 
of contemporary Muslim writings on Christianity and contemporary Christian 
writings on Islam, in order to explore the issues central to Christian-Muslim 
relations. One particular comment of hers, concerning populist writing, was 
influential in starting this study. It explained her exclusion of the writings of 
Ahmed Deedat (1918–2005) and the reasons why she had not incorporated 
Tracts in her survey:
It is a sobering thought that Deedat gains more exposure than any of the 
writers cited in this chapter, although strictly speaking the quality of his 
work, which after all hardly aspires to go beyond the level of rhetoric and 
apologetic, is poor even by the standards of religious polemic. It is on the 
basis of both quality and genre (as with Christian missionary literature, 
tracts were not incorporated) that his works have not been included […].
Zebiri, 1997: 47–8
This highlighted a gap in the study of such literature, both Muslim and 
Christian. This book sets out to investigate this area of literature.
In ‘Muslim Affirmation through Refutation, A Tanzanian Example’ 
(Chesworth, 1999), a brief survey of tracts in Swahili was carried out, covering

Introduction
the period from the 1890s until the present. The study led to the consideration 
of the ways in which Christians and Muslims use such material to reach people 
of the other faith.
The situation in East Africa is special, in that a local language, Swahili, rather 
than Arabic, has become the lingua franca of Islam. At the same time, it has 
become the official language of two of the countries, Kenya and Tanzania. This 
means that much Muslim material has been written directly in Swahili, rather 
than simply being translated from European or Asian languages. This is espe-
cially true of tracts (short treatises and pamphlets), many of which are readily 
available at very low cost throughout East Africa. Some groups producing such 
tracts have been influenced by external forces, including the writings, visits 
and videotapes of Ahmed Deedat and others.
The scriptures quoted in the tracts presented here are all in Swahili, although 
in a few instances the Arabic text for a passage from the Qurʾān is also given. 
Making the Bible available in a local vernacular has been one of the main ways 
in which the message of Christianity has been promulgated, whereas for Islam, 
their scripture is only regarded as being the Qurʾān when it is in Arabic, lead-
ing to tensions when versions have been produced in other languages. In most 
cases the title of the versions will give an indication that it is a commentary on 
the Qurʾān and should be seen as giving an interpretation of the Qurʾān, and 
should not be regarded as the actual Qurʾān.
By the 1930s in East Africa, pragmatism set in, when it was acknowledged 
that many Muslims were not able to read the Qurʾān; even if they had memo-
rised it, they did not understand it, they could only repeat it like a parrot (Bang, 
2003: 126).
Issues about the ‘translatability of scripture’ have been raised by Lamin 
Sanneh, Translating the message: The missionary impact on culture (1989), 
Hussein Abdul-Raof, Qur’an translation: Discourse, texture and exegesis (2001) 
and Abdallah Saeed in The Qur’an: An Introduction (2008). A detailed discus-
sion of these issues is given in the section ‘Scripture in Swahili’ in chapter 5.
Much has been written about Islam and Christianity and how their intel-
lectuals relate to each other. However, little work has been done on the use of 
‘popular literature’ in the form of tracts and their use in outreach. Swahili has 
been examined as a language and some work has been done on its develop-
ment as a religious language but, little has been done on the use of Swahili in 
tracts.
The book sets out to understand the range of religious tracts using Swahili 
that are available in East Africa, to set them in their historical context, exam-
ining how both Muslims and Christians use scripture, rather than focusing on 
one group’s use.

Chapter 1
Studies of tracts have largely concentrated on Muslim examples, for 
instance Chanfi Ahmed’s, Les Conversions à l’Islam Fondamentaliste: Le cas 
de la Tanzanie et du Kenya (2008), which examines tracts by Ngariba and 
Kawemba, or Samadia Sadouni’s, La controverse Islamo-Chrétienne en Afrique 
du Sud: Ahmed Deedat at les nouvelles forms de débat (2011), which examines 
Deedat and his approach to using the Bible to convince Christians that they 
are wrong.
In Mihadhara as a method of Islamic daʿwah in Kenya (2012), Joseph Mutei 
examines the public debates and how Muslim preachers, including Ngariba 
and Kawemba, use the Bible in their talks.
Joseph Wandera has carried out extensive research on Muslim-Christian 
interaction in ‘Christian-Muslim co-existence in the light of sacred texts and 
present contexts. With special reference to Mihadhara in Nairobi’ (2008); ‘The 
Use of Sacred Texts by Islamic Public Preachers in Mumias, Western Kenya’ 
(2015) and Public Preaching and Interfaith Relations: The Influence of Muslim 
and Pentecostal Leaders in Western Kenya (2018) where he examines the situa-
tion from both the Muslim and the Christian perspective.
Marloes Janson and Birgit Meyer discuss the need to develop a ‘framework 
for the study Christian-Muslim encounters in Africa’ (2016, Africa, 615–19), in 
order ‘to explore the possibilities and impossibilities of a comparative study of 
Islam and Christianity’ (615).
A number of scholars have done this, looking at Muslims and Christians in 
specific contexts. These include:
David Robinson’s Muslim Societies in African History (2004) which has case 
studies on ‘Ethiopia: Muslims in “a Christian Nation”’ (108–23) and ‘Buganda: 
Religious Competition for the Kingdom’ (153–68), examining Muslim and 
Christian interaction in an historical context.
The role of scripture in politics in Africa is addressed in Scriptural politics: 
The Bible and the Koran as political models in the Middle East and Africa, edited 
by Niels Kastfelt (2003). In it various studies examine competition between 
Islam and Christianity and how both the Bible and the Qurʾān have been used 
to establish state models; of note for East Africa are the chapters by Holger 
Bernt Hansen and Michael Twaddle. Hansen, in ‘The Bible, the Qurʾan and 
the African polity: Towards a secular state’ (42–54) gives an overview of the 
continent, before using Uganda as a case study, whilst Twaddle, in ‘The Bible, 
the Qurʾan and political competition in Uganda’ (139–54), focuses on Uganda, 
giving an historical analysis that helpfully raises some of the linguistic compe-
tition between Swahili and Luganda.
The Cross versus the Crescent: Religion and Politics in Tanzania from the 1880s 
to the 1990s (2005) by Lawrence Mbogoni gives an overview of how Islam and

Introduction
Christianity competed with each other. Of note in the context of this book are 
the chapters on ‘Early Christian Polemic in Kiswahili against Islam’ (63–88) 
and ‘Muslim Mihadhara against Christianity in the 1990s’ (171–84).
Muslim-Christian Encounters in Africa, edited by Benjamin Soares (2006), 
includes studies on several regions and different situations, such as the 
re-introduction of Sharia in Northern Nigeria and its impact on communi-
ties there (Ostien, Kogelmann); the divide between Muslims and Christians 
because of butchery in Ethiopia (Ficquet); missionary legacy in Egypt and 
Sudan (Sharkey); conversion in colonial Nigeria (Shankar) and outreach strat-
egies in East Africa (Chesworth).
Barbara Cooper’s Evangelical Christians in the Muslim Sahel (2006) exam-
ines the impact of Christian missions on a strongly Muslim area of Niger 
through a series of case studies, giving a detailed account covering the French 
colonial period and post-independence. This is complemented by Shobana 
Shankar’s Who shall enter paradise? Christian origins in Muslim Northern 
Nigeria, ca. 1890–1975 (2014) which examines how Christianity began and 
developed in Northern Nigeria, where the British policy in the colonial period 
strictly restricted Christian missionary activities.
Sharī‘a in Africa Today: Reactions and Responses, edited by John Chesworth 
and Franz Kogelmann (2014), includes chapters by African researchers who 
looked at the interaction between Muslims and Christians. Salma Mohamed 
Abdalla, in ‘Contradicting State Ideology in Sudan’ examined Christian-Muslim 
relations among Internally Displaced Persons in camps in Khartoum; Chikas 
Danfulani, in ‘Education is Education’ examined Muslim women’s views 
on Education in Northern Nigeria in a context where state education was 
viewed with suspicion as being both Western and Christian; Halkano Abdi 
Wario’s ‘Debates on Kadhi’s Courts and Christian-Muslim Relations in Isiolo 
Town’ looked at voter education for the referendum on a new constitution in 
Northern Kenya.
The presence of African Traditional religions provides an additional factor 
in understanding how Muslims and Christians interact. Examples of studies 
on this subject are J.D.Y. Peel’s final work, Christianity, Islam, and Oriṣa Religion: 
Three Traditions in Comparison and Interaction (2016) and Beyond Religious 
Tolerance: Muslims, Christians, and Traditionalists in an African Town edited by 
Insa Nolte, Olukoya Ogen and Rebecca Jones (2017) which looks at the Ede, who 
live in a Yoruba town in south-west Nigeria. Different relationships between 
faiths are examined through various situations, including at the Polytechnic 
and Interfaith marriages.
The emergence of ‘Chrislam’ amongst mainly Yoruba communities in urban 
Nigeria mentioned by J.D.Y. Peel (2016), is further explored by Marloes Janson

in ‘Unity through diversity: A case study of Chrislam in Lagos’ (2016, Africa, 
646–72), and developed further in ‘Moses is Jesus and Jesus is Muhammad: 
The Chrislam movement’, in Crossing religious boundaries: Islam, Christianity 
and ‘Yoruba Religion’ in Lagos, Nigeria (2021, 58–89). Two groups in Lagos, 
who combine aspects of both Islam and Christianity in their worship and 
use both the Bible and Qurʾān, are studied by Janson. These groups arose in 
Lagos in the 1970s at a time of religious revival and increasing inter-ethnic 
and inter-religious confrontation. Chrislam can be understood as a ‘mixing of 
Christian and Muslim beliefs and practices’ without trying to harmonise the 
two faiths (Janson), and may be regarded as pluralistic, rather than syncretistic.
Both Hans Olsson, in Jesus for Zanzibar. Narratives of Pentecostal belong-
ing, Islam, and Nation (2016) and Arngeir Langås, in Unity is strength. The Joint 
Committee of Religious Leaders for Peace in Zanzibar, 2005–2013 (2017) present 
aspects of Christian-Muslim interaction in the complex situation of Zanzibar, 
with a Muslim majority and a significant Christian presence, where religion, 
ethnicity and political allegiances can result in heightened tensions.
Benjamin Soares ‘Reflections on Muslim-Christian Encounters in West 
Africa’ (2016) provides an invaluable overview of recent literature and research 
on Muslim-Christian encounters in Africa.
All these studies wrestle with the tension of whether it is possible to draw 
comparisons between the two traditions or one seeks only to record what is 
observed. This book seeks to record what is observed, both in the historical 
records and in the ways that scripture is used in tracts. It also draws compari-
sons between the ways that Muslims and Christians use and interpret scripture 
in the tracts examined.

Data Collection
In order to understand the use of tracts by Muslims and Christians in East 
Africa during the early part of the twenty-first century, the research was carried 
out in the following ways:
By collecting tracts that were in circulation from around 1980–2005, to 
gather information from the tracts themselves as to their publishing his-
tory and contemporary use.
By examining archival records to collect information on tracts and 
their historical use by both Muslims and Christians in East Africa to gain 
an understanding of the range and variety of tracts that have been and 
continue to be in circulation in East Africa.

Introduction
This research revealed the wide range of tracts in circulation in East Africa 
and showed that many were prepared to teach and inform adherents about 
aspects of their own faith. Others, however, had been written to reach out to 
those of the other faith, either eirenically or polemically.
This book focuses on tracts that make use of scripture and other religious 
material to inform or attack the other. To do this, the contents of a number 
of tracts published in Swahili were examined in detail, to assess the range of 
scripture used in the tracts.
As several versions of the Qurʾān and the Bible are available in Swahili it was 
important to gain an understanding of the history of these versions and their 
reception and to understand different attitudes towards the translatability of 
scripture. Specifically, Islam has resisted the use of languages other than Arabic 
for reading the Qurʾān, whereas Protestant Christianity has favoured reading 
the Bible in the vernacular. Depending on when the various tracts were written 
or translated into Swahili, different versions of the Qurʾān and Bible were used 
in the texts. In some instances, the authors may have also attempted to give 
their own rendition of scripture in Swahili.
The passages of scripture from the Qurʾān and the Bible, together with other 
religious material, were identified to study the ways in which the various writ-
ers used and interpreted them.
From the over one hundred tracts in Swahili written by Muslims or Christians 
that were collected, the range of groups producing them was assessed and it 
was decided to limit the groups to Muslim tracts from the Sunnī tradition and 
Christian tracts from the Protestant tradition. Other groups were excluded in 
the analysis due to limitations of space and time. For instance, tracts from Shīʾa 
and Ibāḍī Muslim groups and the Aḥmadiyya, as well as those from Roman 
Catholic, Orthodox Christian or Pentecostal groups, were not included.
It was also found that many Christian tracts published in Swahili had been 
translated from other languages. As only one Christian group, Biblia ni Jibu, 
was found to be writing its material in Swahili, it was necessary to include 
Christian tracts that had been translated from other languages, to show a rep-
resentative range of use of scripture.

Background of Islam and Christianity in Kenya and Tanzania
Much has been written about the history of Islam and Christianity in East 
Africa. This section records the key events and refers to the literature to pro-

Demography
Reliable religious demographics are difficult to obtain and vary depending 
on the source (Chesworth, 2007a: 123–4). Both Kenya and Tanzania conduct 
ten-yearly censuses, but do not ask about religious affiliation.
4.1.1	
Kenya
In Kenya the reported percentage of Christians varies between 60% and over 
80%, whilst that for Muslims varies from less than 10% to more than 30%, with 
a small percentage of traditionalists. The Pew Forum on Religion and Public 
Life gives the percentages as:
[A]pproximately 88.5% of the population is Christian, including 62.6% 
Protestant and 25.9% Catholic. An additional 7% of the population is 
Muslim and 4.2% indicate no religion.
Pew Forum, 2009
The World Christian Database gives the percentages for 2015 as:
Christian 80.3%, Muslim 7.9%, Ethnoreligionists 9.3%.
WCD, 2018
whereas the World Fact Book published by the Central Intelligence Agency of 
the USA (CIA) gives the percentages as:
Christian 83%, Muslim 11.2%, Traditionalists 1.7%.
CIA, 2018
Coast Province, including Mombasa and Lamu, has a majority of Muslims, dat-
ing back from the arrival of the first Muslims in the ninth century CE, or pos-
sibly earlier; North-East Province and Eastern Provinces have many Muslims, 
especially amongst the pastoralists in the North and amongst the Somali com-
munity. Muslims are also found in all large towns as well as in pockets in Rift 
Valley and Western Provinces, dating back to the development of Arab trade 
routes in the nineteenth century.

Tanzania
No consensus has been reached as to the actual proportions of Christians and 
Muslims within the country. As only one post-Independence national cen-
sus, that of 1967, has asked a question concerning religious affiliation, only

Introduction
estimates of the proportions are available. Even the 1967 figures are interpreted 
differently by C.K. Omari and A.M. Kettani. Omari (1984: 5), quoting the census 
data, reports them as:
Muslim 30%; Christian 32% and Traditionalists 37%,
whereas Kettani (1985: 219), using the same figures, says that the proportions 
are:
Muslim 31.7%; Christian 31.2% and Traditionalists 36.0%.
Both Omari (1984: 5) and Kettani (1985: 219) say that the official approach to 
the existence of the three main religions in the country is to give equal per-
centages of 30 to each, for the sake of convenience, rather than the true pic-
ture. Both Christian and Muslim sources can be found which state that they 
are the larger community:
Christians 44% 
Smith, 1994: 11
Muslims 70%
Bakari, 1993: 84
The World Christian Database gives the percentages for 2015 as:
Christian 56.5%, Muslim 31.6%, Ethnoreligionists 11.3%,
WCD, 2018
whereas the CIA’s World Fact Book states the percentages as:
[M]ainland – Christian 61.4%, Muslim 35.2%, folk religion 1.8%;
Zanzibar – almost entirely Muslim.
CIA, 2018
The proportion of Christians and Muslims is probably closer to 40% for each, 
with a slightly greater number of Christians, but this is hotly contested by 
Muslims.
The coastal regions have a majority of Muslims, together with signifi-
cant numbers inland around Tabora, Ujiji and Bukoba, all on the Arab trade 
routes. Most large towns have a Muslim presence, even where the indigenous

population has rejected Islam. The population of the Islands of Zanzibar 
and Pemba is nearly all Muslim. The islands joined Tanganyika as the United 
Republic of Tanzania, following a revolution in January 1964, just after inde-
pendence. Previously they had been ruled by the Sulṭān of Zanzibar, an Ibāḍī 
Muslim of Omani origins. Before the European colonization in the 1880s the 
Sulṭān had controlled the 10 mile coastal strip of the mainland and obtained 
guarantees of the continuance of sharīʿa (Islamic law) after the strip was occu-
pied by Germany and Britain (Chesworth, 2009, 2011a).
4.2	
Islam
Islam arrived in East Africa within a short time of Muḥammad’s death, brought 
by traders. It became established on the coast and spread inland from the 
eighteenth century. Muslims are to be found throughout the whole of East 
Africa, with concentrations in all urban areas and in Northern Kenya, Western 
and Southern Tanzania as well as the coastal regions (Trimingham, 1964; Safari, 
1994; Nzibo, 1984, 1995). During the colonial period, the coastal strip was under 
the rule of the Sulṭān of Zanzibar and sharīʿa was applied (Freeman-Grenville, 
1962, 1988; Trimingham, 1964). Muslims were involved in the independence 
struggles and have a sense of having been disinherited at independence, which 
took place in Tanganyika in 1961 and in Kenya and in Zanzibar in 1963 (Lodhi, 
1986, 1994; Lodhi and Westerlund, 2000; Kindy, 1972; Said, 1998).
Most African and Ḥaḍramī Arab Muslims are Sunnī, following the Shāfiʿī 
Madhdhab (School of Law). Many Asians are members of one of the Shīʾa 
groups (Bakari, 1995); there is an Ibāḍī presence due to those with Omani 
origins (Hoffman, 2004). The various Sufi turuq (orders) present have had an 
effect on the spread of Islam (Nimtz, 1980). Wahhābi-inspired reform move-
ments have recently made an impact among younger Muslims (Kahumbi, 1995; 
Chande, 1998).
Two books examine coastal Islam in Tanzania: Gerard van de Bruinhorst, in 
‘Raise your voices and kill your animals’ (2007), studies the Muslim community 
in Tanga, North-Eastern Tanzania, and Felicitas Becker, in Becoming Muslim 
in Mainland Tanzania, 1890–2000 (2008), studies the Muslim community in 
South-Eastern Tanzania.
With reference to Kenya, Mohamed Mraja, in Islamic impacts on marriage 
and divorce among the Digo of Southern Kenya (2007), examines the challenges 
of Islam on Digo culture and tradition concerning marriage and divorce and 
Janet McIntosh, in The edge of Islam (2009), examines the Muslim community 
in Malindi.
These books help to explain the history and experience of Islam amongst 
coastal Muslims in Tanzania and Kenya.

Christianity
When Vasco da Gama reached East Africa in 1498, he was accompanied by 
Catholic missionaries (Chesworth, 2014b: 304–7; Mkenda, 2015: 800–4; Furtado 
Martins, 2015: 808–10; Mombo, 2017: 551–5). However, the Christian presence 
established during the sixteenth century did not survive the withdrawal of the 
Portuguese at the end of the seventeenth century (Sundkler and Steed, 2000).
Christian missionaries returned in 1844 when Ludwig Krapf, serving with the 
British Church Missionary Society (CMS), arrived in Zanzibar and then moved 
to Mombasa. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Protestant and 
Catholic missionary societies arrived from Britain (Anderson-Morshead, 1955; 
Hewitt, 1971, Chesworth, 2022a), Germany (von Sicard, 1970; Wright, 1971) and 
France (Kollman, 2005) and opened up ‘mission stations’ in different parts of 
East Africa, which were later to be designated as ‘spheres of interest’ (Oliver, 
1964; Sundkler and Steed, 2000).
Amongst the Protestant denominations, the earliest to become established 
were the Anglicans, Lutherans and Unitas Fratrum (Moravians) in Tanzania 
and the Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians in Kenya. They were followed 
both in Kenya and Tanzania by the Society of Friends (Quakers), the Seventh 
Day Adventists and the Africa Inland Mission, which formed its own denomi-
nation, Africa Inland Church (Oliver, 1964; Sahlberg, 1986).
Various Roman Catholic orders sent missions to East Africa: the Missionaries 
of Africa, known as White Fathers (WF) arrived in 1878; the Holy Ghost Fathers 
(HGF) also known as Spiritans arrived in 1885 and the Benedictines arrived in 
1887 (Frederiks and Chesworth, 2022; Oliver, 1964; Kollman, 2005 and 2022).
Christianity succeeded in attracting followers through preaching and the 
provision of education and health services (Beidelman, 1982), and spread espe-
cially in inland areas, away from the Muslim presence (Hastings, 1996). After 
the Second World War, there was a rapid growth of Pentecostal churches in 
East Africa (Hofer, 2006) and African Instituted Churches (AICs), particularly 
in Kenya (Barrett, 1968).

Relations between Christians and Muslims
At independence, Muslims were at an educational disadvantage, meaning 
that often they were unable to gain government employment; this increased a 
sense of being ‘second-class’ (Said, 1998).
In the early years of independence, Christian-Muslim relations in general 
were harmonious. Tensions increased due to a variety of factors, particularly 
the growth of a more aggressive style of outreach: evangelistic campaigns by 
Christians, often called ‘Crusades’ (Mlahagwa, 1999), and the development of 
Comparative Religious Study by Muslim preachers, using the Bible to show

Chapter 1
the truth of Islam in mihadhara (Chesworth, 2006; Wandera, 2008, 2016 and 
2018; Mutei, 2012). In Tanzania, Muslims and Christians were warned by the 
government not to preach against other religions. In 1998 the then President, 
Benjamin Mkapa, spoke about kashfa za dini (religious slander), which was 
seen as an attack on Muslims by the government (Njozi, 2000; Mbogoni, 2005).
The place of sharīʿa, which has been followed for centuries on the coast, 
using a system of Kadhi’s (Arabic: qāḍi) Courts, has recently become an issue 
in Kenya, where its place in the constitution is questioned, and on mainland 
Tanzania, where it was abolished after independence. This has increased ten-
sions between Muslims and Christians (Mwakimako, 2007; Chesworth, 2009 
and 2011b; Wario, 2014; Kopwe, 2013 and 2014; Sesi, 2013).
In August 1998, the American Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi were 
bombed by al Qaida which led to heightened tensions between Muslims and 
their governments. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 on the US served to remind people 
how Americans had been seen to look after their own, rather than Kenyans and 
Tanzanians, at the time of the embassy bombings in East Africa. This contrib-
uted to anti-American feelings.
The impact of terrorism on the Muslim community in East Africa is dis-
cussed by Abdallah Kheir in ‘Islam and Muslims in Kenya before and after 
September 11’ and by A.F. Tamim in ‘The War on Terror, Islamic Threat, Public 
Policy and the Phenomenon of Exclusion by Integration: The Case of Tanzania’, 
both 2007.
Tensions have also been raised as to who has the right to slaughter animals 
for the community. In most parts of Eastern Africa Muslims have become 
butchers supplying both Muslim and Christian communities. In some areas 
suspicion has been raised against Muslims that they are using the profits to 
help fund terrorism. Some Christian groups attempted to start their own butch-
eries, which led to tragic results in Tanzania, where an Assemblies of God pas-
tor was killed in Buserere in February 2013 (Ng’atigwa, 2013: 144–5; Chesworth, 
2017: 397–9).
Franz Wijsen (2007) captures the tensions throughout Africa between the 
different faiths when he writes:
Africa is a continent where 40% of the people are Muslims, 40% are 
Christians and 20% are adherents of Indigenous Religions; where reli-
gious extremism is growing, both in Islam and Christianity […] where 
Christianity grows fast but Islam grows faster; where there is a real 
battle raging between Islam and Christianity to win the hearts of the 
‘untouched’.

Introduction
Both Christian and Muslim outreach can at times lead to a heightening of 
tension and increasing divisions between the communities.
5	
‘Crusades’ and Mihadhara
Christians and Muslims have both used public rallies in order to reach out and 
try to convert, or often antagonize, each other.
5.1	
Christian Outreach
From the mid-1980s, Christians began to organise outreach in the form of pub-
lic rallies. These ‘Crusades’ are usually held on open ground in an easily acces-
sible part of a town. Meetings are held daily in the late afternoons for up to two 
weeks. They usually have several choirs and a well-known speaker, either from 
within the country or abroad (Chesworth, 2006).
A feature of some of these meetings has been the trend of being aggres-
sive toward other religions. Muslims have found this approach offensive and 
threatening.
In addition, street preachers are to be found in any large town, often provid-
ing lunchtime ‘entertainment’ for workers.
Another form of current evangelism is the use of radio and television by 
evangelists. In Kenya, the state broadcasting channel, Kenya Broadcasting 
Corporation (KBC), and Family TV both regularly broadcast programmes fea-
turing evangelists. Family TV has a regular lunch-time spot featuring Bennie 
Hinn, who also visits Kenya and holds rallies. Two regular ‘tele-evangelists’ 
are Bishop Margaret Wanjiru of Jesus is Alive Ministries and Evangelist Pius 
Muiru of Maximum Miracle Centre (Galgalo, 2003; Chesworth, 2006). In 2006, 
Hope FM, a Christian radio station in Nairobi, was violently attacked after it 
persisted in broadcasting phone-in programmes concerning Muḥammad and 
Islam, despite threats.
Some Christian groups have been involved in polemical preaching amongst 
Muslims. In Tanzania, one group, Biblia ni Jibu (The Bible is the Answer) has 
been particularly outspoken and its leader has been stopped from speaking 
and arrested on several occasions.
5.2	
Muslim Outreach
Muslim outreach (daʿwa) has become increasingly visible in recent years, 
using a variety of methods, some of which are copied from methods used by 
Christians.

Chapter 1
One reason for the greater level of activity is the return of students from 
Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, which has brought friction not 
only between the graduates and conservative Muslims, but also between them 
and the followers of other religions especially Christianity (Kahumbi, 1995: 
172). This in turn has led to polemical public debates (mihadhara) in big towns 
like Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru; foreign preachers from Tanzania often 
conduct these (Chesworth, 2006; Ahmed, 2008; Wandera, 2008, 2016 and 2018; 
Mutei, 2012; Wario and Amara, 2013; Mfumbusa, 2014: 255–6).
In January 1998, President Mkapa, speaking at a meeting in Tabora, spoke 
out against ‘People who go about distributing cassettes, booklets and conven-
ing meetings where they insulted and ridiculed other religions’ (Aziz, 1998: 2). 
This speech was seen by Muslims as an open attack only on them, whereas both 
faith groups have used these methods. The Muslim weekly An Nuur reported 
such apparent discrimination, when an Assemblies of God Church was given 
permission to hold a meeting whilst at the same time the Imam of Chaurembo 
Mosque was taken in by the police for planning a meeting. Muslims were upset 
by this action which they saw as a clear case of discrimination against them 
(An-Nuur, 1999: 197).
Muslim preachers began using mihadhara from 1984 onwards as a method of 
presenting ‘comparative religious study.’ This followed a visit to Dar es Salaam 
in 1981 by the South African Muslim polemicist Ahmed Deedat (d. 2005). He 
subsequently visited Nairobi and Mombasa in 1993. The Muslim preachers’ 
approach is modelled on Deedat’s. The speaker commonly uses the Bible to 
show the truths of Islam, demonstrating that the ‘Five Pillars’ of Islam were 
being followed by Jesus and Moses and challenging the listeners as to why it is 
that Muslims still follow these practices, whilst Christians have rejected them 
(Chesworth, 2011a, 2011b and 2013a).
In addition, Paul is vilified, as the perverter of Jesus’s message. The preach-
ers argue that if Christians knew what Jesus had really taught, they would 
revert to Islam.
In recent times, Muslims have become suspicious of certain Christian 
groups who have been offering educational support for Muslim children, as 
some of these groups insist on the children receiving Christian education 
as part of the sponsorship (Kabia, 2006: 49–50; Stambach, 2010; Mfumbusa, 
2014: 251–3).
The way in which scripture is used in outreach by Muslims and Christians 
is a part of the struggle to win the ‘battle’. This book seeks to understand how 
scripture is used in contemporary tracts in Swahili available in East Africa.

Introduction
5.3	
Mijadala (Discussions)
Whilst most public rallies are presented in such a way as to favour the faith 
of the organisers, some attempts have been made to allow speakers to pres-
ent their arguments in an unbiased manner. In 2009 at Ukunda, on the south 
coast near Mombasa, Kenya, Oscar Osindo, a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, 
organised a series of joint discussions; these were deliberately called mijadala 
(discussions), rather than mihadhara (Osindo, Mjadala, 2009).
The ground rules for these meetings indicate that every attempt was made 
to allow for balance. Each of the talks had an agreed topic, and a Muslim and a 
Christian jointly chaired the session. The audience was cautioned not to cheer 
when points were ‘scored’ by one or other of the speakers. The speakers were 
given a set amount of time to speak, and to respond. In addition, each speaker 
had a reader to read from agreed versions of the Qurʾān and Bible. In all cases 
both speakers used both the Qurʾān and the Bible to demonstrate their case.
This approach can be seen as being less partisan and allowing greater oppor-
tunity for the speakers to present their case. However, the audience disregarded 
the chair and cheered when they perceived that their ‘side’ was winning.

Tracts
As was indicated at the start of the chapter this study of the origins of tracts 
and their use has been conducted over a number of years. This has allowed 
the collection of material that was in circulation during the last decades of the 
twentieth century and the opening decade of the twenty-first century, afford-
ing a snapshot of a method of distribution which is now superseded by the use 
of the internet and social media. However, the contents of the tracts under dis-
cussion are still influential; the ways in which they use scripture, to defend one 
faith and to disparage the other, still continue to be used in current discourses 
in social media and on the internet. This study reflects how such material was 
presented in print media that was readily available within East Africa.

Historical Background to Tracts
To understand the use of tracts in East Africa at the end of the twentieth cen-
tury and the start of the twenty-first century, a survey was carried out of organ-
isations writing and publishing religious tracts for use in East Africa from the 
nineteenth century onwards.

Chapter 1
The work of two British groups, the Society for Promoting Christian 
Knowledge (SPCK) and the Religious Tract Society (RTS) was studied. This 
was carried out through use of archives and published sources. The use of 
tracts in East Africa in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by two British 
missionary societies, the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Mombasa and 
the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) in Zanzibar, was exam-
ined through the societies’ archives at the University of Birmingham and the 
Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. This was done so as to understand the 
ways in which the societies worked in producing tracts, and their interaction 
with other agencies, in particular SPCK and RTS, who provided grants for the 
production of various tracts.
Tracts produced in the twentieth century by various German missionary 
societies, mainly Lutheran, were examined, using the annual Kalenda and pub-
lished sources. This was done to gain a broader perspective of the approaches 
of Protestant missions working in East Africa in areas with a significant Muslim 
presence.

Collection of Tracts
So as to discover what tracts are in current circulation, visits were made to var-
ious places within East Africa, to a mixture of large cities and smaller regional 
towns, to collect religious tracts written in Swahili, from both Muslim and 
Christian sources, regardless of the date of their first publication. In particular 
tracts originally written in Swahili were examined where possible, rather than 
those translated from other languages. Having collected around a hundred dif-
ferent tracts, those that used scripture to promote or defend one faith against 
the claims of the other were examined to find out how scripture was used.
Several locations for systematic collection of material were chosen:
Major urban centres with significant numbers of both Muslims and Christians 
were visited and tracts collected between 2000 and 2003:
In Tanzania:
Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Morogoro;
Subsequently, Tanga and Zanzibar
In Kenya:
Nairobi and Mombasa
Selected smaller rural towns were surveyed in December 2000 and January 2001:

Introduction
In Tanzania:
Musoma and Ngara
In Kenya:
Kisii
It was found that little material was readily available in the smaller towns 
in Kenya and Tanzania. Following the visit to Ngara in January 2001, Furaha 
Jackson Kamana, an Anglican priest and former student of this researcher sent 
tracts that had been collected in Ngara.
A survey conducted in Kampala in July 2001 found virtually no tracts were 
available in Swahili, so no further collection of material was attempted in 
Uganda.
Most of the tracts collected were found in the larger urban centres; dupli-
cates of material collected in Tanzania were also found in Kenya, particularly 
in Mombasa.
Some of the tracts were already in the author’s possession, having been 
collected between 1990 and 2000 in Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Morogoro and 
Nairobi when living in Kongwa, Dodoma Region, Tanzania. Being unable to 
visit Mombasa until June 2003, two people from Mombasa, Rhoda Luvuno 
Dzombo, in December 2000, and Ferdinand Manjewa in June 2001, who were 
students at St Paul’s United Theological College, Limuru, visited booksellers to 
gather duplicate material.
All the tracts collected are listed separately in the Bibliography.

Criteria for Selection of Tracts
Each tract was read, their original language of composition and the scriptures 
used were noted. Those that used passages from the Qurʾān and/or the Bible 
were chosen for closer study. In particular, the ways in which the passages of 
scripture were interpreted and presented by the writers were examined. The 
following questions were asked:
How were the passages of scripture used to support what the writer was 
saying, concerning their own faith or that of the other?
Did they follow the usual patterns of interpretation? Were the mean-
ings of the passages from the Qurʾān and the Bible presented from an 
‘orthodox’ point of view by both Muslims and Christians?
Or, did the writers seemingly interpret passages of scripture so as to 
denigrate the other?

Introduction
Did the various writers make use of earlier exegetes of the passages?
Did they use material from other scholars to support their arguments?
In their use of scripture and its interpretation, were they responding 
to other understandings of the passages of scripture to defend or attack?
Eight tracts were selected.
Tracts by Muslim writers:
1)	
Mussa Fundi Ngariba and Mohamed Ali Kawemba, Uislamu Katika Biblia
2)	
Saidi Musa, Maisha ya Nabii Isa (Alahais Salam)
3)	
Abbas Gombo Kanoni, Kwa Nini Niliacha Ukristo na Nikawa Muislamu
4)	
Warsha ya Waandishi wa Kiislamu, Uislamu ni Njia Sahihi ya Maisha
	
Tracts by Christian writers:
1)	
Tanzania Evangelical Literature Ministry, Isa (Yesu Kristo) Ndani ya 
Kurani na Biblia
2)	
Iskander Jadeed, Hapana! Dini ya Kristo Haijabatalishwa
3)	
K.K. Alavi, Kutafuta Uhakika
4)	
Cecil Simbaulanga, Je Roho Mtakatifu ndiye yule Msaidizi?
Five of the tracts were written in Swahili and three had been translated from 
another language.
All the selected tracts use scripture; the extent of this use ranges from 
Maisha ya Nabii Isa (Alahais Salam) by Saidi Musa with nineteen Qurʾānic 
passages, to Kwa Nini Niliacha Ukristo na Nikawa Muislamu by Abbas Gombo 
Kanoni, which has over two hundred Biblical and eleven Qurʾānic passages.
Each of the tracts is introduced with a short biography of the author and an 
outline of the tract and details of where it was collected and what is known of 
its publishing history; this is introduced more fully in chapter 6.

Categories of Selected Tracts
In order to compare approaches used by Muslim and Christian writers, the 
selected tracts have been grouped into the following categories:
Using scripture to refute the other’s faith
Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20
Testimonies of those who have moved from one faith to the other
Teaching material to train readers

For each category a Muslim tract is paired with a Christian tract, with passages 
given in Swahili with an English translation to show how scripture is used.

Outline of Book
After this Introduction, the book is divided into two parts.
Part 1, Tracts and Translation in East Africa, gives the historical background 
to the tracts being used in East Africa from the nineteenth century and during 
the twentieth century. This will help the reader to better understand the con-
text of the tracts that are presented in Part 2.
Chapter 2 examines early Christian tracts in East Africa, tracing records of 
the earliest tracts to be circulated in the early 1840s by the American Consul 
to Zanzibar, Mr R.P. Waters. The use of tracts by Christians in East Africa is 
then surveyed, revealing the support that British religious societies, in par-
ticular the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and Religious 
Tract Society (RTS), gave to the Anglican missionaries working with Church 
Missionary Society (CMS) and Universities’ Mission to Central Africa (UMCA). 
Two early publications are examined in detail: Msafiri, a Swahili translation of 
Pilgrim’s progress, and Raha isiyo karaha (Unhampered happiness), the earli-
est Christian tract to be written in Swahili and published in Mombasa using 
Arabic script.
Chapter 3 surveys Christian tracts in East Africa during the twentieth cen-
tury, drawing on the records of Protestant missions. The chapter shows the 
variety of titles available from both German Protestant, mainly Lutheran, mis-
sions and the Anglican missions. It looks at the colonial period, with UMCA 
discussing future plans for working amongst Muslims at a synod in 1944 and at 
preparations for the post-colonial period, with the Islam in Africa Project being 
started in 1959 with a survey of Muslim activity in Africa by the International 
Missionary Council. The use of a network of bookshops to aid the dissemi-
nation of the material is assessed. The chapter ends by examining Christian 
outreach after independence and looking at material produced for use in Bible 
colleges to teach students about Islam and Christian-Muslim relations.
Chapter 4, Muslim tracts in East Africa during the Twentieth century, exam-
ines the literary response of Muslims in their tracts and looks at how Muslims 
in East Africa began producing tracts in order to propagate their faith. It notes 
the important role played by Sh. al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui (1890–1949) and Sh. 
Abdalla Saleh al-Farsy (1912–82) in using Swahili in their writing to ensure that 
their meaning was clearly understood. Research conducted in 1960 by Bethwell 
Kiplagat and Sigvard von Sicard shows the range of tracts that were available

Introduction
then, many of which were found to still be in circulation at the time of this 
present research. Following independence, new approaches in propagating 
the Muslim message were introduced, in particular using the Bible so as to 
refute Christianity, following the methods developed by Ahmed Deedat. This 
led to the establishing of Muslim Preachers of the Bible, especially those call-
ing themselves Jumuiya ya Wahubiri wa Kiislamu Tanzania (Society of Muslim 
Preachers of Tanzania) (JUWAKITA).
In Chapter 5, Swahili as a religious language and its use in different versions 
of the Bible and Qurʾān is described and set in context. The different versions 
of scripture in Swahili are introduced; these demonstrate the attitudes and 
approaches to translation of different groups as well as raising questions as to 
the translatability of scripture. This becomes significant when one considers 
that the two earliest versions of the Qurʾān in Swahili were not by Muslims. 
The variety of Swahili dialects is noteworthy as many of the selected texts use 
non-standard Swahili, and reflect dialectical forms of Swahili, particularly in 
regard to spelling and, occasionally, sentence structure and grammar.
In summary, Part 1 sets the historical context and introduces the different 
ways that Muslims and Christians have used material written in Swahili, exam-
ples of which are examined in detail in Part 2.
Part 2, Muslim and Christian Tracts, uses eight tracts, four written by Muslims 
and four written by Christians, to examine how passages of scripture from the 
Qurʾān and the Bible are utilised.
Chapter 6, Tracts in current circulation in East Africa, introduces the eight 
selected tracts and describes how they are presented in the subsequent chap-
ters. It also sets out the criteria used for selection, focusing on their use of 
scripture.
Chapter 7, Using scripture to refute the other’s faith, discusses a Muslim tract 
Uislamu Katika Biblia (Islam in the Bible) by Mussa Fundi Ngariba (died 1993) 
and Mohammed Ali Kawemba, and a Christian tract Isa (Yesu Kristo) Ndani ya 
Kurani na Biblia (Isa (Jesus Christ) in the Qurʾān and Bible). Both tracts make 
extensive use of scripture, both the Bible and the Qurʾān, with the purpose of 
refuting the other’s faith.
Chapter 8, Jesus in the Qurʾān, Al-Māʾida (5):112–20, examines Saidi Musa’s 
Maisha ya Nabii Isa (Alahais Salam) (The Life of the Prophet ʿĪsā (Peace be 
upon Him)) and Iskander Jadeed’s Hapana! Dini ya Kristo Haijabatalishwa (No! 
The Religion of Christ has not been Abrogated), which both use parts of the 
same passage from the Qurʾān, Al-Māʾida (5):112–20, to advance their argu-
ments, but in different ways.
Chapter 9, Testimonies of converts, looks at tracts written by people who 
have converted to the other faith, explaining why they chose to leave their faith

and join the other. These are Kwa Nini Niliacha Ukristo na Nikawa Muislamu 
(Why I left Christianity and I became a Muslim) by Abbas Gombo Kanoni and 
Kutafuta Uhakika (In Search of Assurance) by K.K. Alavi.
Chapter 10, Teaching those of your own faith, presents tracts that were pre-
pared for members of their own faith, in order to instruct them about aspects 
of the other faith. The tracts identified are Uislamu ni Njia Sahihi ya Maisha 
(Islam is the True Way of Life) written by Warsha ya Waandishi wa Kiislamu and 
Je Roho Mtakatifu ndiye yule Msaidizi? (Is the Holy Spirit really that Helper?) by 
Cecil Simbaulanga, the leader of Biblia ni Jibu.
The book ends with concluding remarks drawing together Parts 1 and 2 and 
raising issues arising from the the mixed messages presented by the tracts.

Chapter 2
Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
This chapter surveys the use of tracts in East Africa since the earliest recorded 
examples in the 1840s. It looks first at Christian tracts in the nineteenth cen-
tury, with special attention being paid to the support given by the Society for 
the Promoting of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and the Religious Tract Society 
(RTS) to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and the Universities’ Mission to 
Central Africa (UMCA). It examines the procedures followed to produce tracts, 
and the first tracts to be published and printed in East Africa, using the exam-
ple of a tract by W.E. Taylor, Raha isiyo karaha (1897).
1	
The First Christian Tracts in East Africa
In January 1844, Ludwig Krapf arrived in Zanzibar, the first CMS missionary 
to arrive in East Africa. He records that the American Consul, Mr R.P. Waters, 
was a ‘zealous friend of the mission’ (Krapf, 1968: 122) and that he was already 
distributing tracts (Krapf, 1968: 127). In his journals, Krapf records a discussion 
with Waters, who gives reasons why Krapf should remain in Zanzibar, includ-
ing that ‘A Missionary would besides distribute a vast number of tracts to the 
Natives and Europeans, who continually visit this place’ (CMS/CA5/O16/164 
8th January 1844: 22). This sentence only appears in the original manuscript, 
‘Log of journey from Aden to Mombasa’ and does not appear in the printed 
edition. This demonstrates that tracts were viewed as a method of outreach for 
‘Evangelical’ Christians in the mid-nineteenth century. Later in the journals, 
Krapf records a meeting with the Muslim governor of the island of Pemba:
We touched at the island of Pemba […] where the governor received me 
kindly […] He asked me many questions concerning the politics and reli-
gion of Europe, and expressed a wish for an Arabic Bible. This I sent him 
afterwards through Mr. Waters.
Krapf, 1968: 127
When he reached Lamu he records that:

Chapter 2
An Arab chief from Lamu who saw me reading the Psalms asked me for 
the book, and being much pleased with it begged for a complete Bible. 
Arabic tracts would have been eagerly welcomed by the people.
Krapf, 1968: 130
The Proceedings of the Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East for 1844 
records that:
During this journey Dr. Krapf distributed a large number of portions of 
the Scriptures. He remarks – It is really pleasing to see the desire which 
the people have for obtaining books.
CMS Proceedings, 1844: 50
From these reports we can see that both Krapf and Waters saw the distribution 
of tracts as being an important method of outreach.1
The coastal peoples of East Africa used Swahili, which had been written 
using Arabic script from at least the sixteenth century. Swahili as a language is 
dealt with in chapter 5.
UMCA was started following the call by David Livingstone ‘to overthrow the 
African slave trade with Christianity’ (Anderson, 1977: 13). In 1861 UMCA sent 
missionaries to Shire, in present-day Malawi, but, following the death of their 
leader, Bishop Charles Mackenzie, they withdrew in 1862. In 1864 UMCA sent 
missionaries to Zanzibar, with Bishop William Tozer as their leader; they estab-
lished themselves there and worked to halt the slave trade and to establish a 
Christian presence (Sahlberg, 1986: 34).
Missionaries were keen to promote literacy, by teaching people to read and 
write, to enable them to learn about the Christian faith through reading Bibles 
and other catechetical material. This led to an interest in printing so as to pro-
vide reading matter.
In 1875 Henry M. Stanley, whilst at the court of the ruler of Buganda, Kabaka 
Mutesa, was asked to explain the Bible to the Kabaka. This was an enquiry, 
resulting from the Kabaka having already been influenced by the Qurʾān given 
to him by Arab traders, which had also stimulated an interest in the written 
word (Sundkler and Steed, 2000: 572). Stanley had with him, as an interpreter, 
Dallington Maftaa, who was a pupil of the UMCA School on Zanzibar. Together 
they prepared ‘a little Swahili book of Bible selections, embracing all the princi-
pal events from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ’ (Sundkler and Steed, 
1	 See Chesworth ‘Ludwig Krapf’ (2022c: 195–204) for a brief biography and description of his 
interaction with Islam in East Africa.

Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
2000: 568). This ‘little book’ can be regarded as being a tract, although it seems 
unlikely that it was actually printed.
Also in Buganda, Alexander Mackay, one of the earliest CMS missionaries, 
who was posted there in 1877, set up a printing-press so that tracts and Bibles 
could be printed (Sundkler and Steed, 2000: 570). In 1890 Bishop Tucker took 
supplies of tracts from the UMCA book-store in Zanzibar (UMCA/Home 14 
Correspondence Letter Book 1890–1899: 20) and in 1896 he reports on finding 
tracts abandoned at Eldama Ravine after a caravan en-route to Uganda was 
attacked by the local Nandi people.
On arriving on the river bank (the Guaso Masa) I found books, letters, 
fragments of boxes, and (strangest of all) fragments of plaster images 
scattered about in all directions. […] Here and there were tracts of vari-
ous kinds (Protestant) and broken crucifixes. It was strange to see a tract 
on “Christ our Righteousness” lying on the ground side by side with a 
broken plaster image.
CMS Proceedings, 1896: 94
The plaster images (statues) in the wreckage came from loads left behind by 
the Roman Catholic Bishop Henry Hanlon, that were then sent on with the 
CMS advance party. In 1907 in Busoga, Uganda, the President of the Chief’s 
Council, Twasenga, used to distribute copies of Mateka, the CMS ‘beginners’ 
booklet’ (Sundkler and Steed, 2000: 592). The distribution of material by 
Twasenga, together with the example of Waters mentioned above, illustrates 
the trend seen earlier in Britain where tracts were readily distributed by lay 
Christians who wished to help to propagate the Gospel.

Support from SPCK and RTS for Work in East Africa
Both SPCK and RTS were providing support for the various missions working 
in East Africa. The records of meetings and letter-books from archives of the 
various societies serve to illustrate how this support was achieved.

SPCK
Allen and McClure record that CMS ‘chiefly asked for books, reading-sheets, 
and tracts, etc., and type for their mission printing-press’ (Allen and McClure, 
1898: 359).

Chapter 2
In 1887, SPCK provided a grant of £79 for a printing-press and type for CMS 
(Allen and McClure, 1898: 517). This printing-press was based in Frere Town, 
the community for freed slaves, established by CMS on the mainland, across 
the creek from Mombasa Island. The CMS Proceedings for 1887 reports that:
Mr. Dodd, lately working with the Universities’ Mission, preferring the 
views and methods of the C.M.S., has, with Bishop Smythies’ approval, 
been engaged temporarily to manage the new printing-press.
CMS Proceedings, 1887: 36
Mr Dodd was replaced the following year by Mr Pratley, a printer by trade, 
who had been in training at the CMS training institution in Islington (CMS 
Proceedings, 1888: 48).
Apparently SPCK’s terms for giving equipment were unclear to CMS. This 
is shown in a letter that F. Baylis, Africa Group Secretary, wrote to W.G. Peel, 
Bishop of Mombasa, in November 1904, when a request for additional assis-
tance for type from CMS to SPCK had elicited a lengthy explanation from Allen, 
secretary to SPCK. The letter from Baylis to Peel says:
2. Printing-Press at Frere Town. – In addition to matters on the enclosed 
documents, I have only to add a few words about Frere Town Press. On 
submitting the application for more Type to the S.P.C.K. we were told the 
S.P.C.K. never made grants of Presses or Type except to become Diocesan 
property, and then only to the Bishop on his own request. Reference was 
made to an earlier grant from the S.P.C.K. for what we were calling our 
Press. Evidently the S.P.C.K. considered their grant made in 1887 for the 
purpose of the Press and Type as making the Press Diocesan property, 
so that they are not prepared for us to look upon it as C.M.S. property. 
I am corresponding with Mr. Allen on the subject. I think it is new to us 
to learn that this was their view in making the grant, and we shall do our 
best to put the matter on a right footing with them. I should think it likely 
that we shall feel the right thing is to say the Press is to be looked upon 
as Diocesan property, and, if so, it will lie with you to judge whether you 
care to ask for any Type with a view to making it more effective, knowing 
that it must in that case be, in the last resort, your own responsibility to 
control and work the Press.
It seems that the S.P.C.K. now make it a condition that Press or Type be 
not used for printing any version or portion of the Bible or Prayer-Book 
without previous sanction of the S.P.C.K. Foreign Translation Committee.

Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
Perhaps if you do feel led to ask for more Type you will let any appli-
cation pass through our hands, or at least let us know that you make it.
CMS Letter-book (outgoing) 10 January 1901–26 October 1906 XCMS/B/OMS/A5/
G3 L9: 337
The importance of separation between mission and diocese for SPCK is clear. 
A factor that may have been forgotten by SPCK was that when the original 
grant had been made in 1887, Frere Town had been a part of the Diocese of 
Eastern Equatorial Africa begun in 1884 with its headquarters in Mombasa. 
James Hannington (1847–85), the first bishop, was killed in October 1885 en 
route to Uganda, Henry Parker (d. 1888) was the second bishop; in 1890 Alfred 
Tucker (1849–1914) became bishop and remained as Bishop of the Diocese of 
Uganda with William Peel (d. 1916) becoming the first Bishop of the Diocese of 
Mombasa in 1899 (Hamilton and Twaddle, 2004; Pirouet, 2004).
It becomes clear from correspondence and minutes that CMS asked for 
support in the publishing of material. SPCK is mentioned twice in a letter of 
January 1903 from Gladstone in the CMS offices in London, to Burt, in Mombasa.
6. Swahili “Notes on the Catechism” and Kikuyu Vocabulary. We shall be 
prepared to ask the S.P.C.K. to print these books when we receive the MS.
9. Swahili books granted by the S.P.C.K. On an application made by your 
Executive Committee some time ago the S.P.C.K. have kindly granted a 
number of Swahili books. We enclose a copy of the invoice sent to us.

This shows that CMS was in effect given the material granted them by SPCK at 
Net value and would be expected to sell it at the prices listed, remitting the Net 
value of the material to SPCK as a donation. For instance, the item listed as ‘24 
Miscellaneous Stories & Translations’ had a selling price of 1/-, a total value of 
24/- and was provided at a cost of 18/-, that is, a 25% discount. When these had 
been sold, CMS were expected to send a donation to SPCK of 18/-.
SPCK apparently was more generous to UMCA and it gave grants to help 
establish the Diocese of Zanzibar and to establish schools and colleges. 
Between 1868 and 1898 SPCK awarded a total of £1936 to UMCA (Allen and 
McClure, 1898: 517).
A letter written on 22 June 1896 from C.J. Viner, the Lay [Financial] Secretary 
for UMCA, to SPCK, accompanying a cheque for £22/12/2 from the sale of SPCK 
books and tracts in their bookshop in Zanzibar, shows that UMCA had a sim-
ilar agreement with SPCK to that with CMS, concerning remitting donations 
from the sales of books granted to them (UMCA/Home 14 Correspondence 
Letter Book 1890–1899: 496). There is similar correspondence between Baylis 
and Taylor at CMS, explaining the processes and then reporting money being 
remitted ‘home’ for payment to RTS and SPCK (CMS Letter-book (outgoing)

and was translated into at least eighty African languages; at least 22 were pub-
lished by RTS and 4 by SPCK (Hofmeyr, 2004: 240–2). In 1888, RTS supported 
the production of a Swahili version of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, Msafiri 
in Swahili (Hofmeyr, 2004: 242).
The translator’s preface is of interest as it shows remarkable co-operation 
between UMCA and CMS missionaries.
The first five sections of this book contain a nearly verbatim translation 
of the first part of the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ and were written almost wholly 
by the late Bishop Steere.
[…] The language used is Swahili, as commonly understood in Zanzibar.
The metrical rendering of the original Preface is due to the kindness 
and scholarship of the Rev. W.E. Taylor, B.A., of the Church Missionary 
Society’s staff at Mombasa. It is written in the dialect of Swahili current 
in that town and neighbourhood.
Madan, 1888: 5
In spite of the support of W.E. Taylor for the UMCA edition, in 1897 the CMS 
annual report mentions that E.C. Gordon has translated Pilgrim’s Progress into 
Swahili and that it has been published by RTS (CMS Proceedings, 1897: 96).
C.J. Viner (UMCA), in a letter of 1 August 1890 to the Editorial Secretary 
CMS, informed him that Bishop Tucker had collected a number of different 
titles from the UMCA bookshop in Zanzibar prior to his journey to Uganda. 
Amongst these were ‘200 copies of Swahili Pilgrim’s Progress printed for us by 
RTS towards which we paid £9’ (UMCA/Home 14 Correspondence Letter Book 
1890–1899: 20). This indicates that UMCA contributed a part of the cost of pub-
lication for the first edition. Then, after five years, the first edition had sold out 
and UMCA approached RTS concerning a re-print.
C.J. Viner wrote to L.B. White of RTS concerning the printing of a new edi-
tion of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress:
26th April 1893, The Revd Dr. L.B. White, Religious Tract Society
My Dear Sir,
In 1888 your Committee very kindly issued for this Mission a Swahili 
version of ‘Pilgrims’ Progress’. I understand that all the copies printed 
were sent out to our headquarters in Zanzibar.
The book has been found very useful and we have constant requests 
for more copies which we are unable to supply. We shall be very grateful 
to your Society if you could repeat your kind grant and furnish us with 
another 1000 copies.
Mr A.C. Madan, our [illegible] Swahili scholar is now in England & 
would gladly revise the proofs.

UMCA
UMCA soon began a printing-press and was actively producing material locally 
from as early as the 1870s. C.J. Viner, writing to CMS in 1890, concerning books 
taken by Bishop Tucker, includes ‘1280 copies of Holy Scripture printed at 
our Mission Press in Zanzibar’ (UMCA/Home 14 Correspondence Letter Book 
1890–1899: 20).3

Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
Steere [d. 1882]’. It also lists books in Swahili, some of which concern Islam: 
Muhammadi (Life of Mohammad) 1889 and Koran na Biblia (The Qurʾān and the 
Bible) 1900, both by A.C. Madan (Zanzibar, 1905: 6–7, 11). Other books include 
the Bible and Prayer Book and those used for teaching both Christianity and 
general Education; however, it must be assumed that this other material used 
Swahili in Roman script (Zanzibar, 1905: 6).
Edward Steere (1829–82) was a UMCA missionary in Zanzibar from 1864–82, 
and the third Bishop of Zanzibar. Cedric Frank writing about Steere says:
Every day he spent at Zanzibar, he was wont, soon after breakfast, to go 
to the printing office, where he remained until nearly noon, revising and 
correcting proof-sheets of his various Swahili translations. Often he set 
up the type himself and sewed together the pages of the little pamphlets 
and tracts which came to him wet from the press.
Frank, 1952: 40–1
The UMCA printing-press was busy and Steere ensured that the standard of 
work was creditable. A small meeting-room was built on the site of the former 
slave market, where the Cathedral would be built. Steere wrote to a friend ‘The 
room was filled to overflowing with listeners and the tracts and papers we were 
able to print were eagerly snatched from my hands’ (Frank, 1952: 40).
In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, various tracts 
concerning Islam were published and distributed by UMCA including: 
Muhammadi maisha yake pamoja na habari za Waislamu na Maturuki (The life 
of Muḥammad together with information on Muslims and Turks) published in 
1898; Shuhuda za dini ya Kimasihia pamoja na kupeleleza kidogo dini ya Isilamu 
(Witnesses to the religion of the Messiah together with a small investigation 
of the religion of Islam) by J. Murray 1905; and, writing in 1936, Al-Amin b. Aly 
also refers to two books by Dale: Tarjuma ya Kur’an (Translation of the Qurʾān) 
and Maisha ya Muhammad (The Life of Muḥammad) (Lacunza Balda, 1997: 99, 
fn. 15). By Tarjuma ya Kur’an, Al-Amin b. Aly is probably referring to the Swahili 
Qurʾān Tafsiri ya Kurani ya Kiarabu kwa lugha ya Kiswahili pamoja na Dibaji na 
maelezo Machache (Translation of the Arabic Qurʾān into the Swahili language 
together with a Preface and a few brief explanations) by Godfrey Dale, pub-
lished in 1923 (Chesworth, 2022b: 440–57).
The wide range of tracts that were available at that time with the purpose 
of attracting Muslims to Christianity indicates that some of the Christian 
Missions, the UMCA in particular, saw this as a key aim.

W.E. Taylor and Raha Isiyo Karaha
Tracing the history of this tract serves to illustrate the way in which a tract came 
into being, and also the longevity of many tracts. William Ernest Taylor (1856–
1927), a CMS missionary who worked in Mombasa from 1880–97, is described 
by P.J.L. Frankl as Swahili Scholar extraordinary (Frankl, 1993: 37; Chesworth, 
2022d: 278–89. Taylor chose not to live in Frere Town with the other CMS mis-
sionaries, but rather to be on the island, living in Mombasa. There he worked 
hard at studying Swahili with many of the learned scholars. Before his ordina-
tion as a priest by Bishop Hannington in 1885, he spent some of his time doing 
medical work, the result of one year’s medical study in Edinburgh (Frankl, 
1999: 160). In the 1883 Proceedings of the Church Missionary Society for Africa 
and the East it is reported that:
Mr. Taylor, though not a fully qualified medical man, has a considerable 
surgical practice, not only among the people attached to the Mission, 
but also among the Suahili, Arabs and Hindus of Mombasa and its 
neighbourhood.
He writes, ‘I have had many opportunities of preaching Christ in my 
medical practice, and have been able to lend Arabic works, as Al Kindy 
and Pfander’s Mizan, in quarters where they may do good. Of the Arabs 
resident in Mombasa, there are several said to be well disposed towards 
Christianity, but afraid to declare their belief’.
CMS Proceedings, 1883: 44
His developing ability in Swahili enabled him to evangelise as he practised. 
In addition, he was a regular speaker in the market-place (Chesworth 2006: 
161–2). There he sang evangelical hymns, which he had composed using the 
local musical measures (Frankl, 1993: 38).
Whilst he was on leave in 1892, he married Catherine Tesseyman, and on his 
return to Mombasa later that year he began working on producing a tract Raha 
isiyo Karaha, which he translates as ‘Unhampered Happiness!’ and ‘Joy with-
out Alloy’ (CMSG/C11 Foreign Literature Committee: Taylor in letter 12.08.1901); 
Farouk Topan translates it as ‘Comfort without Discomfort’ (Topan, 1992: 345, 
fn. 15). The tract was first produced in 1893 and a copy was sent to CMS and pre-
sented at a committee meeting held on 25 July 1893; this copy can no longer be 
traced in the CMS archives. The entry for Taylor in the Register of Missionaries 
and Native Clergy 1804–1904 states: ‘Tract, printed by himself at Mombasa, 
presented Oct., 1893, which he claims to be the first book in Native charac-
ters printed and published in E. Eq. Africa’ (CMS Register 1904: 190). As the 
al-Maṭbʿa al-Sulṭāniyya (Sultanate Press) had begun operating in 1879–1880,

printing in Arabic script (Sadgrove, 2005: 153), Taylor’s claim to be the first has 
to be doubted.
By reading the Letters and the Minutes from Frederick Baylis and the Group 3 
Committee of the CMS Parent Committee (PC), it is possible to re-construct 
the history of the various editions of the tract. CMS records from 1880 were 
kept in a highly sophisticated manner.
Group 3 referred to the Group Committee which met to attend to Africa, 
Palestine, Egypt and New Zealand. The committee met once a month to dis-
cuss reports from each field and to make recommendations to the Parent 
Committee (Williams, 1990: 268, fn. 12). They usually met on or around 24th 
of each month to discuss the East Africa Mission. The incoming papers were 
numbered chronologically for each year. ‘A printed précis was prepared for 
each meeting of the Group Committee. This included a summary of the con-
tents and the proposals for committee action. These precis [sic] became the 
agenda papers for the committee and were pasted into the précis book on the 
left-hand side. On the right-hand side the action of the relevant committees 
and secretaries was noted’ (Williams, 1990: 265, fn5).
At the meeting of Group 3 Committee which was held on 25 July 1893, the 
tract Raha isiyo Karaha appears under items 183 and 184. Item 184 records ‘Copy 
of “Unhampered Happiness” in Swahili (Arabic characters), reproduced by the 
mimeograph’, whilst Item 183 appears as:

CMS Precis book (incoming) 1892–1895 XCMS/B/OMS/A5/G3 P 4 25.07.1893
Interpreting this information, it can be seen that Taylor had produced the tract 
in ‘Native Character’, meaning Swahili in Arabic script, by using a mimeograph. 
The purchase of the mimeograph machine and a typewriter had previously 
been approved by the Parent Committee. A mimeograph was a machine, pat-
ented by Thomas Edison in 1876, but not given that name until 1887. The Arabic 
script was written on a stencil, which was then placed on a slate block, then 
inked, using a roller; a sheet of paper was then placed above it and the case 
closed; when opened, the image on the stencil had been copied onto the paper.
Having succeeded in obtaining a mimeograph, Taylor then wanted to 
employ an assistant to help him in the reproduction of more tracts. The Group 3 
Committee recommended it, and this was adopted by the Parent Committee 
on 1 August and a letter was written to Rev. A.G. Smith on 4 August 1893. The 
CMS secretaries wrote their response to the Rev. A.G. Smith, rather than to 
Taylor. This is because the decision would then have to be discussed by the 
Frere Town Finance Committee (FTFC) and Smith was the corresponding sec-
retary for CMS in Frere Town.
The Frere Town Finance Committee (FTFC) discussed the proposal: the 
Precis book, for the Group 3 Committee of 24 October 1893, records ‘Item 248, 
Minutes of Frere Town Finance Committee. 2. Mr Taylor is glad of the grant 
for producing Swahili Tracts’ (CMS Precis book (incoming) 1892–1895 XCMS/B/
OMS/A5/G3 P 4 24.10.1893).
The Meeting of Group 3 Committee 24 November 1893 records ‘Item 269 
Minutes of Frere Town Finance Committee 14. P.C. requested to grant $96 for 
1894 for producing literature in Swahili characters. (lxxxv) request grant for

Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
The records of decision-making by the various committees of CMS reveal 
that Taylor had produced a tract and that he needed assistance to produce 
more copies. The grant for 1894 was awarded, yet no clear reference was sub-
sequently made to the production of tracts by this method nor was mention 
made of who was employed to assist Taylor.
The next reference to the tract appears in Extracts from the Annual Letters of 
the Missionaries for the year 1894–95 where Taylor reports:
Mr. Bailey, the accountant, with wonderful skill, reproduced some Arabic- 
Swahili (character) tracts on the typograph or cyclostyle, and we were 
hoping to make use of them with great effect, but the printing off is not 
so satisfactory in producing a legible copy as at home; and I fear that his 
trouble was thrown away.
CMS Extracts, 1895: 9
From this it seems that the work of the mimeograph was not successful and 
that during 1894 Taylor had worked with J.A. Bailey, the CMS accountant, who 
had been in Frere Town since 1889, using a cyclostyle, an implement for cutting 
stencils, with a small toothed wheel, but that the results were unsatisfactory.
It is known that in 1897 the RTS published the tract with ‘blue covers with a 
black imprint in the middle of (to us) the back cover and Roman print oppo-
site the Arabic text’ (letter from Taylor to Staples, 12.08.1901). It appears that 
the Arabic script was set and then cast in zinc moulds. ‘The book was photo’d 
on Zinc Plates, & Moulds taken after printing’ (Taylor to Baylis, 07.08.1901), 
whilst it seems that the moulds for Roman script were broken up, or lost, after 
the print run (Taylor to Staples, 20.08.01). Fifty copies were sent to Mombasa 
and it is reported that another mission received 250 copies (CMS Precis book 
(incoming) January 1900–February 1907 XCMS/B/OMS/A5/G3 P 6). Lacunza 
Balda lists the same pamphlet as being published in 1897, but published by 
SPCK (Lacunza Balda, 1997: 126).
As no record of applications for grants for the 1897 edition of the tract 
appears in CMS correspondence, it seems that Taylor had negotiated its pub-
lication directly with RTS. In a letter (dated 19th August 1901, G/C 11 Foreign 
Literature Committee) from Henry Clark at RTS to Staples at CMS he sends 
their ‘file-copy’ of the 1897 tract. The RTS Archives revealed no mention of the 
request for funds for printing the tract in the minutes of the weekly commit-
tee meetings for this period. However, RTS records for correspondence for this 
period are incomplete.
In August 1901, Taylor, now in Britain, having heard from F. Burt in Mombasa 
that the supplies of the tract were exhausted, began the process of negotiating 
for its re-printing. Correspondence to Baylis and H.E. Staples at CMS and Henry

Clark at RTS eventually led to the matter being discussed at the September

record:

RTS gave £11 for the costs of printing the new edition; grant-in-aid of £5, that 
is, the cost of some of the material, rather than actual money, was also given 
(CMS Precis book (incoming) January 1900–February 1907 XCMS/B/OMS/A5/

Early Christian Tracts in East Africa
RTS reprinted five hundred copies of the tract in Arabic script only. 
The cover, dated 1902, states that it is published by the Religious Tract 
Society (RTS) for the ‘CMS Mission in Swahililand’ (RTS, 1902: cover) see 
Figure 2.2. Of these, 250 copies were sent to Mombasa (CMS Letter-book (out-
going) 10 January 1901–26 October 1906 XCMS/B/OMS/A5/G3 L 9: 165, Letter 
Gladstone to Burt, December 1902).
The tract continued to be seen as having a purpose, as in 1935, in A.R. Pittway’s 
Annual Letter to CMS, he relates that the tract had been re-printed in Nairobi 
in Arabic script, and is ‘causing a stir’.

Chapter 2
We then got an old tract reprinted. This tract was written by a missionary 
named Taylor who worked at Mombasa years ago, and was written in dia-
logue form representing a conversation between a missionary doctor and 
a Moslem priest. It very clearly shews the failure of the Moslem religion 
to meet man’s deepest needs and the adequacy of the Gospel. This tract 
created quite a stir and I was told in the street by a leading Moslem that 
if it were not for the British being in authority I should have by this time 
been killed.
CMS Annual Letter, Pittway, 1935: 3
The tract was reproduced in what appears to be a photographic copy of 
the 1902 RTS re-printing. At the end of the tract is written, ‘Published by 
C.M.S. Bookshop, Nairobi and printed in East Africa by W. Boyd & Co. (Printers) 
Ltd. Nairobi’ (Taylor, 1934: 13). See Figure 2.3.
Another re-printing was undertaken later: P.J.L. Frankl refers to ‘a printing

(hymns). The passage ends with the Qur’anic invocation: Wa’l hamdulillahi 
(And praise is due to Allah)’ (1992: 345). This passage does not appear in the 
Roman script edition published in 1940.
In 1960, Bethwell Kiplagat and Sigvard von Sicard report finding a copy, together 
with some books by Godfrey Dale of UMCA, and they comment ‘unfortunate 
comparisons and arguments have caused these books to become obnoxious in 
the eyes of E.A. Muslims. They should, therefore, be read with this in mind and 
not be made the sole source of information in regard to Islam’ (Kiplagat and 
von Sicard, 1960: 32).
Frankl reports that Shaykh al-Amin bin Aly Mazrui wrote against this tract 
and others as he ‘resented the printed attacks made by Christian missionar-
ies upon Islam’ (Frankl, 1993: 38). Also, Lacunza Balda quotes Mazrui writ-
ing in 1936 ‘Christians have composed many books to show to the peoples of 
East Africa the wickedness of the Islamic religion and its teachings, and have 
insulted the apostle Muhammad’ (Lacunza Balda, 1997: 99).
This exploration into the history of one tract serves as an example to show 
the lengths to which writers went to ensure that material was produced and 
made available. It also demonstrates the period of time over which such mate-
rial had an influence, in that, over forty years after it was first produced, it was 
denounced by Mazrui. Yet in 1960, Kiplagat and von Sicard found that it was 
still available.
This chapter surveyed the use of tracts by Christians in East Africa, revealing 
the support that British religious societies, in particular, SPCK and RTS, gave 
to the Anglican missionaries working with CMS and UMCA. The next chapter 
continues by reviewing tracts produced and distributed in East Africa during 
the twentieth century.

Chapter 3
Christian Tracts in East Africa during the 
Twentieth Century
During the Nineteenth century most of the tracts available in East Africa had 
been produced by Anglican Missionary Societies. Towards the end of that cen-
tury, other missionary societies became established and began producing their 
own tracts. This chapter starts with a survey of tracts produced by German 
Missionary Societies, which were mainly Lutheran, in Deutsch Ostafrika 
(German East Africa [GEA]). With the expansion of literacy after the First 
World War, tracts gained a wider audience as reading matter became increas-
ingly important. Christian tracts produced at the end of the colonial period 
and during the first years of independence are surveyed.

Tracts from Lutheran Missionary Societies in Deutsch Ostafrika
As a part of the ‘scramble for Africa’, Germany chose to colonise East Africa 
and formed Die Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (The Society for German 
Colonisation) on the initiative of Dr Carl Peters. Peters and his party arrived 
in Tanganyika in 1884, forming the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft (The 
German East African Company) in 1885. The Berlin Conference (1884–5), 
which ‘carved-up’ Africa amongst the European powers, led to the formation 
of Deutsch Ostafrika in 1886 (von Sicard, 1970: 28–9). The first Lutheran mission 
arrived in Dar es Salaam in 1887, Evangelische Missiongesellschaft für Deutsche 
Ostafrika (EMDOA) (The Protestant Missionary Society for German East 
Africa), commonly referred to as Berlin III. Different missionary societies were 
founded in Berlin and they were differentiated by the use of a Roman numeral. 
Berlin I: Gesellschaft zur Beförderung der evangelischen Missionen unter den 
Heiden founded in 1824; Berlin II: Gossnersche Missionsverein founded in 1836 
(von Sicard, 1970: 53–4). When the German Protestant missions arrived, they 
found Anglican missions, UMCA and CMS, and Roman Catholic missions, Holy 
Ghost Fathers (HGF) and the Missionaries of Africa, more often known as 
White Fathers (WF), with established mission stations in many areas of GEA.1

1914 lists details of the missions and when they arrived in German East Africa. 
Carl Hellberg (1965), Sigvard von Sicard (1970) and Marcia Wright (1971) have

literature, including tracts. Printing presses were established in Dar es Salaam 
and Vuga, in the Usambara mountains.

Christian Tracts in East Africa
The table in Führer 1914 lists Bielefelder Mission, a reference to Bethel 
Mission, which was based in Bielefelder and founded in 1890 by Friedrich von 
Bodelschwingh (1831–1905). In 1890 EMDOA was reorganised and became more 
distanced from the German government (Sahlberg, 1986: 61). Marcia Wright 
says that EMDOA ‘ultimately achieved respectability as the Bethel Mission 
under Friedrich von Bodelschwingh’ (Wright, 1971: 7).
The 1914 Führer lists the tracts and books published by the various missions; 
those which concern Islam are shown in Table 3.2. The table shows that the 
different German Missions were producing a range of material for educating 
Christians and for reaching out to Muslims.
Rigorous academic study of Islam in German East Africa was under-
taken by Martin Klamroth and Carl Heinrich Becker. Klamroth was Mission- 
superintendent in Dar es Salaam; in 1911 he wrote ‘Der literarische Charakter des 
ostafrikanischen Islams’ (The Literary Character of East African Islam), pub-
lished in Die Welt des Islams. Becker, working at the Hamburg Kolonialinstitut, 
wrote Materialen zur Kenntnis des Islam in Deutsch-Ostafrika (Materials for 
understanding Islam in German East Africa) published in Der Islam in 1913. 
Carl Heinrich Becker’s work was published in English in 1968 as ‘Materials for 
the Understanding of Islam in German East Africa’. This was edited and trans-
lated by B.G. Martin and published in Tanzania Notes and Records No. 68, 1968, 
31–61.

Christian Tracts in East Africa
Moslems in African Languages’ (Patton, 1923: 153). Section one concerns 
‘Swahili Districts’; the report defines the reach of Swahili as a language and 
summarises its development as a written language, quoting Alice Werner, a 
lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). It estimates that 
fifty-five Christian books in Swahili are available (Patton, 1923: 155). The report 
concludes by examining material particularly to do with Islam:
Several books have been written to inform the Christian Church in this 
part of Moslem Africa about the nature of Islam. They include a Life of 
Mohammed by Canon Dale, and a little book on Information about Arabs 
and Mohammedanism. To these may soon be added a Swahili version of 
the Koran by Canon Dale of Zanzibar. Christian hymns in Swahili have 
found a powerful evangelistic force, but no Christian poet has arisen to 
write the Gospel stories in the type of popular verse in which most of 
the Moslem literature is composed. It is thought that a special issue for 
Moslems of the book of Proverbs in Swahili might have great appeal. At 
a conference held at Dar es Salaam by missionaries in East Africa just 
before the war, to consider Moslem evangelisation, the creation of a 
strong Swahili literature was considered an imperative necessity. The 
Berlin Mission began the circulation of a Swahili magazine in German 
East Africa, where no district is untouched by Islam.
Patton, 1923: 155–6
Christian missions and churches were writing and using tracts in their work 
amongst Muslims, and Muslims were responding to what was being said and 
written.

Christian Outreach at the End of the Colonial Period
The First World War led to changes in East Africa. The former German East 
Africa became a British Protectorate, and was named Tanganyika Territory 
(Iliffe, 1979: 247). The inter-war years (1918–39) led to changes within the mis-
sions. German missionaries were deported in 1917 and their stations were 
handed over to other missions or left to local control (Anderson, 1977: 75). The 
German missions were allowed to return from 1925 onwards. In some cases 
they found that the church membership had grown in their absence (Fiedler, 
1996: 113).
Godfrey Dale, a UMCA Missionary who had been based in Zanzibar for 
many years and published the first version of the Qurʾān in Swahili in 1923, 
which is discussed in detail below. In 1909 he published a work concerning 
the doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity: Khabari za dini za

Kiislamu kwa mukhtasari pamoja na maelezo ya ihtilafu zilizopo kati ya dini 
ya Kiislamu na dini ya Kikristo (Notes on Mohammedanism, with answers to 
some Mohammedan objections to Christianity; See Chesworth, 2022b 450–6). 
Of this work Lacunza Balda says:
This was a clear attempt to continue the approach Dale’s predecessors had 
followed in the past: first of all, the plan to provide Swahili translations 
of Christian texts and, secondly to print religious tracts, destined more 
specifically for Muslims with the view of attracting them to Christianity.
Lacunza Balda, 1997: 99
The missions were aware of the Muslim presence and relevant literature was 
being produced and made available. The 1929 stock list of books from the SPCK 
Bookshop in Dar es Salaam shows the following titles, concerning Islam, being 
available:
Contrast between Christianity and Muhammedanism [G. Dale, 1904 
lectures]
Habari za dini ya Kiislamu (Information about the religion of Islam 
[G. Dale, 1909])

The Kalenda 1937, a Church Year Book which includes a lectionary of Bible 
readings and information of work in the Lutheran church, printed for the use 
of church workers and members, lists the following titles as being available 
through the Mission at Usambara:

These lists show that Christian missions were making material available as 
they continued to be concerned about the influence of Islam on Christians.
In the Kalenda 1938, published by Usambara Agentur, Mission Lwandai, the 
formation of the Tanganyika Missionary Council (TMC) in 1936 is announced 
and different Protestant missions working in Tanganyika are listed, together 
with their locations (Kalenda 1938: 34–6). The Kalenda 1939 reports on the 
missions in Zanzibar and Kenya, also the formation of the Kenya Missionary 
Council (KMC) (Kalenda, 1939: 32). These ecumenical groups, TMC and KMC, 
later became key church organisations as the countries approached inde-
pendence; they became the Christian Council of Tanzania (CCT) and National 
Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) respectively.
See Table 3.3 for a list of the Protestant Missions that were working in East 
Africa in the late 1930s.
During the Second World War (1939–45), the German missionaries were 
interned and missionaries from non-German missions were sent to assist the 
Lutheran and Moravian churches. Those sent included Gustav Bernander, 
transferred from Southern Rhodesia in 1941, and Bengt Sundkler, transferred 
from South Africa in 1942, both from the Church of Sweden Mission; other 
missionaries came from the Norwegian Lutheran Mission and the Swedish 
Evangelical Missionary Society (Bernander, 1968: 155; Kalenda, 1951: 28).

Planning for the Future
3.1	
UMCA
The churches continued to grow and UMCA missionaries began to plan for 
the future. In 1943 they were preparing for a Diocesan conference to be held 
in 1944. An item in a ‘Preparatory Memorandum’ raises the question as to 
whether it would be possible to establish ‘in Zanzibar a small college or House 
of priest and lay experts in Islamics?’ (UMCA/Box A 4 (1) Diocese of Zanzibar 
Official Papers, Preparatory Memoranda for Diocesan Conference Part III 
October 1943). This proposal was then expanded:
Their aims would be:
(a)	 To explore all avenues of approach to Moslems and to the 
Mohammaden religion, and to study their doctrines and practices 
with a view to finding the best means to present Christian truth as 
the answer to all these.
(b)	 To act as advisers on all problems connected with Islam to other 
priests in the Diocese who wanted expert advice to help in their 
work with Moslems.
(c)	 To get in touch with the younger generation of educated Moslems. 
In this connection, their house would be a centre where such young 
men would be encouraged to come for discussion, social inter-
course, reading, study circles, lectures etc.

Christian Tracts in East Africa
The community might include an Indian Priest who would work and visit 
amongst Indian Moslems in Zanzibar.
(d)	 But the predominating aim would be to endeavour to show the 
young modern educated Moslem the meaning of sacramental 
Christianity, not only its devotional but also its social implications.
It is just here that Moslems are in complete ignorance of what we believe 
and the consequences of our belief for the world as it is today. They need 
to be shown that we have a solution for the ills of the world founded on 
the Living Christ present in His body the church.
UMCA/Box A 4 (1) Diocese of Zanzibar Official Papers, Preparatory Memoranda for 
Diocesan Conference Part III October 1943
The proposal, as set out above, seems to be far-sighted and to show an aware-
ness of the need for training and equipping Christians to enable them to live 
alongside and reach out to their Muslim neighbours. When the Diocesan 
Conference took place in 1944 these innovative ideas were not adequately 
addressed. The methods of evangelism were discussed, and the following pro-
posals were made:
We recommend the development of a system of Lantern Lectures; to 
this end we suggest that an appeal for such lanterns should be made in 
England, in order that every Parish may have one, with suitable supply of 
slides in each Archdeaconry.
Public Preaching, which consists of preaching the Gospel without 
attacks on other religions, if used with care, will also be of great value. 
[…] [W]e recommend that the Literature Committee produce a series of 
Evangelistic Tracts, some of them to be in Arabic Script, for use largely in 
connection with Lantern Lectures and Public Preaching but also for use 
by themselves.

Tracts were prepared; four of them, Swahili in Roman script, are lodged in the

As well as UMCA planning for after the war, other missions also made prepara-
tions, and as the 1950s arrived, it became apparent that the colonial period was 
ending. The missions had to meet the challenge of ‘handing over’ and begin-
ning national churches (see Chesworth, 2014a: 235–40, for further details).
3.2	
Islam in Africa Project (IAP)
In 1957 the International Missionary Council (IMC) met in Ghana and ‘a 
request was made to the staff of the I.M.C. and its Administrative Committee 
to make plans for a study of the problems raised by missionary work in areas of 
Moslem influence in Africa.’ This led to consultations being held at Oegstgeest, 
Netherlands, in September 1958, and Hartford, Connecticut, in October 1958. It 
was proposed ‘to send a messenger to selected areas of Africa’ (Benignus, 1959: 
1). Pierre Benignus, of the Paris Missionary Society, was sent and travelled for 
four months at the beginning of 1959 to:
(a)	 Arouse concern, interest and support within church and mission 
bodies and Christian councils in the areas visited.
(b)	 Make contact with persons of special competence already working 
on the approach to Islam in Africa Project to secure their collabora-
tion and to discuss the whole project with them.
(c)	 Discover what church and mission bodies should and can become 
participants in this advance. More specifically, he should try to find 
the most favourable locations in areas of the three types indicated 
above, and begin local consultations as to the nature of the work 
that might best be undertaken in each such situation. (+)
(d)	 To make contact with training institutions which should be related 
to this concern.
	
	
(+) The three forms of Islam referred to are: 1) Entrenched Islam 
2) New-Islamic Situations 3) Situations of Maximum Fluidity.

Christian Tracts in East Africa
His report was a thorough review of the situation in each country and an 
assessment of the level of co-operation between churches and missions. It was 
presented to the IMC Administrative Committee in July 1959. It was suggested 
in the report that a more detailed survey of East Africa was needed. The main 
recommendation was to establish an infrastructure with suitably trained work-
ers placed to facilitate local committees (Benignus, 1959: 29), and the establish-
ment of the Islam in Africa Project (IAP). This was initially based at Ibadan in

Bookshops
Education was a major task of the missions. With increasing literacy, the need 
for suitable reading material was realised. The missions operated bookshops 
and bookselling safaris (journeys) using mobile bookshops and sending col-
porteurs out on bicycles. Colporteurs are still active. Up to the mid 1990s, stu-
dents from St Philip’s Theological College, Kongwa, in central Tanzania, were 
sent out with a metal suitcase of books, to accompany preaching teams on 
practical placements (personal experience). Seventh Day Adventists now call 
colporteurs, Literature Evangelists; in 1999 they were active in outreach in 
Nairobi (Literature Evangelist, July–September 2000, Number 658: 7).
Bookshops were seen as being important in the preparation for a post-colonial 
future. Details of Christian bookshops were given in the Christian Literature 
Council report presented at the All-Africa Christian Literature Conference in 
Kitwe, in June 1961:
CMS in Kenya – taken over by ESA [Educational Supply Association]

Christian Outreach Post-Independence
The production of material by Muslims has been in response to the great vari-
ety of materials that have been produced by Christians. The following exam-
ples illustrate the breadth of Christian material available in East Africa:
The Kalenda 1960 lists three titles available under Imani nyingine (Other 
faiths):
Muhamadi, Maisha na Mafundisho yake. (Muḥammad, his Life and 
Teachings) Sh.1/90
Muhamadi au Kristo? (Muḥammad or Christ?) Sh.-/35
Hatari za Islamu katika Afrika Mashariki. (The Danger of Islam in East 
Africa) Sh.-/15
Kalenda 1960: covers
The first two of these titles had been available for many years. For Muhamadi 
au Kristo? (Muḥammad or Christ?), the copy examined is dated 1951. On the 
last page there is a footnote:
Kitabu hiki kimekwisha kutengenezwa mara ya kwanza na mchun-
gaji P. Wohlraub, Mtae, mwaka wa 1912: mara ya pili na mchungaji 
E. Dammann, Tanga, mwaka wa 1935; kimepigwa chapa tena mwaka wa 
1948, 2000; 1951, 5000.
This book was initially prepared by Rev. P. Wohlraub, Mtae, in 1912; the 
second time by Rev. E. Dammann, Tanga, in 1935; it was printed again in 
1948, 2000 [copies]; 1951, 5000 [copies].
Wohlraub, 1951
However, Hatari za Islamu katika Afrika Mashariki (The danger of Islam in East 
Africa) was only published in 1956. It was written by Gustav Bernander, of the 
Church of Sweden Mission, and originally advertised for sale in bundles of 100 
copies for 9/-. From the title it appears to have been written as a warning to 
Christians against Islam and thus indicates the attitude of many within the 
church at that time.

Christian Tracts in East Africa
Another tract published in Swahili at this time was Kuwaelezea Waislamu 
Injili (Explaining the Gospel to Muslims), by J. Crossley, of the Islam in Africa 
Project, which was translated by Marjorie Stanway (USCL, 1961, printed in 
Britain). The English original of this is listed for enquirers in the pamphlet 
Questions Muslims Ask, a carefully worded pamphlet produced by the Ghana 
Committee of the Islam in Africa Project. Questions Muslims Ask was origi-
nally written in French, by Claude Molla. It was also translated into Swahili, in 
the 1960s. The first part has now been re-written and is available in Swahili as 
Maswali Wayaulizayo Waislamu; it is also available in French and English.
Many of these tracts had the specific purpose of introducing Muslims to 
Christianity. James Holway comments on the effectiveness of tracts: that 
Muslims could read them unobtrusively and that ‘Muslims reading Bible por-
tions and tracts are becoming Christians’ (Holway, 1971: 270).
Several books have been produced on Islam and Muslim-Christian rela-
tions include: Wana wa Ibrahimu: Wakristu [sic] na Waislamu (The Children 
of Abraham: Christians and Muslims), written by H.P. Anglars. This was pub-
lished originally by the Catholic Seminary at Kipalapala, Tabora, during the 
1960s and covers the life of Muḥammad, the spread of Islam in Africa and the 
differences between Christianity and Islam.
The book is set out in three sections, with the first section relating the life 
of Muḥammad in some detail over 40 pages, including ‘Ndoa za Muhammad’ 
(pp. 28–32) the marriages of Muḥammad, and using this information to exam-
ine Christian teaching on marriage and to discuss the question of a Christian 
who marries a Muslim, giving scripture references from the Bible and Qurʾān. 
The second section deals with the spread of Islam, especially in Africa, includ-
ing trade, slavery and ruling (pp. 66–75). The third section is 22 lessons com-
paring the beliefs of the children of Abraham (pp. 90–189).
Lissi Rasmussen comments that this book has a more positive approach to 
Muslims (Rasmussen, 1993: 93). She also explains that ‘It tries to help Christians 
and Muslims to appreciate each other’s faith as two sides of divine revelation 
and thus come to appreciate one another as human beings […]’ (1993: 94). 
Whilst this is correct, it reads today as a defence of Christianity and a warning 
against Islam.
Ushirikiano kati ya Wakristo na Waislamu (1979), a translation of Christian 
Witness among Muslims, and Njia ya Nabii Muhammad Wakristo waufahamu 
Uislamu (1989), a translation of The Way of the Prophet: An Introduction to 
Islam written by David Brown, were both published by Central Tanganyika 
Press (CTP) for the Swahili Text Book Committee (STBC) of the Association of 
Theological Institutions of East Africa (ATIEA). ATIEA is an interdenominational

organisation with members throughout East Africa. The Swahili Text Book 
Committee is mainly active in Tanzania; its Secretary is the Manager of Central 
Tanganyika Press, which publishes the work commissioned by the Committee 
to be written or translated.3
These two books were used in teaching at Bible Schools, particularly in 
Tanzania, where certificate level courses were taught in Swahili. Njia ya Nabii 
Muhammad has five chapters; the first is Muḥammad the Prophet of Mecca 
(pp. 1–21); chapter two, the Glory of Islam, presents the spread of Islam, the 
faith and practice and the denominations within Islam (pp. 22–39); chapter 
three, Muḥammad the Messenger of Islam, covers the Hijra to Medina and the 
years there (pp. 40–55); the chapter ends with ‘the way of the Cross’ (pp. 55–7) 
setting out the centrality of Christ; chapter four describes foundational differ-
ences between Islam and Christianity (pp. 58–68) and chapter five, ‘there is no 
other way’ (pp. 69–83) sets out why Christianity is the only way and warns of 
the dangers of Islam.
Both Anglars’ and Brown’s books use scripture, the Bible and Qurʾān, to 
explain and to support their case for the primacy of Christianity over Islam.
This chapter has examined the use of tracts and teaching material produced 
by Christians during the twentieth century, with the preparations made by 
mission and church for work after Independence. Much of the material pro-
duced can be regarded as being polemical and antagonistic towards Islam.
The next chapter examines the literary response of Muslims and the tracts 
they produced during the twentieth century.

Chapter 4
Muslim Tracts in East Africa during the 
Twentieth Century
In this chapter Muslim tracts produced at the end of the colonial period 
and during the first years of independence are surveyed. They were written 
by those Muslim leaders who saw the importance of writing in Swahili. The 
approach used in some of the tracts has also influenced contemporary tract 
writers, whilst some of those mentioned are still in circulation.
The Muslim community in East Africa was aware of the missionary activi-
ties of the Christian missions and noted the use of tracts. The Muslim rulers 
and the ʿUlamāʾ (Scholars) knew of developments in other parts of the Muslim 
world, especially through newspapers published in the Middle East and cor-
respondence (Sadgrove, 2004). In 1879 the Sulṭān of Zanzibar, Sayyid Bargash 
b. Saʿīd (r. 1870–88) set up a printing press al-Maṭbaʿa al-Sulṭāniyya (Sultanate 
Press), which used Arabic script and was the first Arabic press in East Africa 
(Sadgrove, 2005: 151–78). The initial responses to Christian missionaries tended 
to be spoken or sung, as was the case reported by W.E. Taylor in 1894 writing 
about the response to the open-air meetings held in Mombasa:
Wherever one goes one hears the words, “Tela sizue!” (Taylor, don’t make 
innovations!) being the refrain of one of the most popular songs, a sort of 
parody of one of our choruses.
Taylor, AL 1895
In this case the response had been set to the tune of one of the Christian 
choruses.
Islam in East Africa began to spread inland during the 1920s, although an 
earlier period of growth of Islam ‘up-country’ had happened following the 
arrival of Sudanese soldiers from the Nuba Mountains of Central Sudan, who 
became known as ‘Nubians’. The German authorities recruited Sudanese mer-
cenaries to act as askaris (soldiers) in 1888 (Iliffe, 1979: 95; Chande, 1998: 43, 
48). In Kenya and Uganda, ‘Nubians’ were also being recruited by the British 
from the remnant of Emin Pasha’s forces, during the late 1880s (Trimingham, 
1964: 26; Twaddle, 1995: 3). The ‘Nubians’ were sent to work ‘up-country’ and 
introduced Islam to many communities.

Chapter 4
Reasons for the growth of Islam in the 1920s include: the change in 
‘world-view’ of men (in particular) who had served as soldiers or worked in 
indentured labour and needed a religion that would embrace this wider 
experience (Buruku, 1973: 96–9; Haule, 1973: 160–2) and the perceived close 
relationship between the colonial government and the church, leading to a 
rejection of Christianity.
During the 1930s and 1940s, East African ʿulamāʾ, largely of Omani or 
Hadrami origin, began to write tracts to inform and educate Muslims. By this 
time, following the growth of Islam during the 1920s, it was possible to differ-
entiate between those Muslims who were from the pwani (coastal regions), 
who were Islamicised, and those of the bara (up-country) who had little 
Islamic knowledge. Many ʿulamāʾ were deeply conservative and considered 
that Arabic was the only proper medium of instruction for Muslims to learn 
about Islam. However, Some, notably Sh. Al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui (1890–1949) 
and Sh. Abdalla Saleh al-Farsy (1912–82), were concerned about the fact that 
most Muslims were not conversant with Arabic. Being pragmatic, they realised 
that it was better to use Swahili as the medium of education, being surer of it 
being understood, rather than relying only on Arabic (Lacunza Balda, 1993b: 
232; Kresse, 2007: 97).
Kai Kresse discusses the key role that al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui held in the 
Muslim community:
In 1930, he began to write, print (in ‘cyclostyle’), and distribute free pam-
phlets giving Islamic advice on current issues of social life. These weekly 
publications were initially written in Arabic script and called ‘Sahifa’ 
(page) because they consisted of a double-sided copy of a single page. 
After sixteen months, the volume grew to a bilingual publication in 
Arabic and Swahili in Latin script. It appeared as ‘Al-Islah’ for another 
twelve months before collapsing because Sheikh al-Amin had to take 
over the position of Qadi of Mombasa.
Kresse, 2003: 286
A selection of Mazrui’s essays from Sahifa, Uwongozi (Guidance), have been 
published, with an English translation (Kresse, 2016).1
Al-Farsy regarded this approach as an encouragement for others to write:
1	 See Guidance (Uwongozi) by Sheikh al-Amin Mazrui pp. 30–1 for a list of Mazrui’s publications 
and English translations.

Muslim Tracts in East Africa
Now many people write religious books in Kiswahili, but it was he who 
started this good thing-even if many people imitate him in this today. 
Thus, everyone who writes religious pamphlets in Kiswahili will get their 
reward from God (thawabu) for having performed this good deed, and Sh. 
Al-Amin will get it (as well) since he was the one who opened this door.
al-Farsy, 1989: 121
Kresse demonstrates the importance of the written medium and it is inter-
esting to note that al-Amin used the same methods for printing his earliest 
pamphlets, by cyclostyle, using Arabic script, as Taylor had done forty years 
previously.
The main purpose of these tracts was to instruct Muslims about their faith, 
in a language that they could understand, and to counter both the perceived 
Africanising of Islam, especially through the spread of turuq (Sufi Orders), and 
the threat of the Aḥmadiyya Mission from Pakistan. The Islamic Foundation 
in Nairobi published Abuʾl-Aʿla-Maudūdī’s The Qadiani Problem in 1978, which 
attacks the legitimacy of the Aḥmadiyya as being truly Muslim. 
The main Sufi orders present in East Africa are the Qādiriyya and the 
Shādhiliyya (Nimtz, 1980: 57–60; Trimingham, 1964: 98–101). The Sufi Orders 
were viewed with suspicion by the coastal Arab-Muslim elite, as there seems 
to have been a supremacist attitude that fluency in Arabic was essential for 
a Muslim to be regarded as being able to understand Islam. The openness of 
the Sufi Orders to Africanising influences and the possibility of achieving a 
position within the hierarchy without Arabic or formal Muslim education was 
attacked by the coastal ʿulamāʾ. August Nimtz (1980) and Justo Lacunza Balda 
(1997) both examine this in detail.
Many tracts were published and widely distributed from the 1940s onwards, 
especially by East African Muslim Welfare Society (EAMWS) from Mombasa, 
see Table 4.1. These were readily available in both Kenya and Tanganyika until 
the 1960s, and are still found today. Justo Lacunza Balda (1989, 1993a, 1993b, 
1997), Roman Loimeier (2003) and Kai Kresse (2003, 2007) have all written 
extensively on the role that al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui, Abdalla Saleh al-Farsy and 
others played in helping East African Muslims to be informed of their own 
faith and culture.

Muslim Tracts in East Africa
1	
Muslim Outreach at the Time of Independence
At this time, Muslims were also producing material with the aim of outreach. 
Jean-Marie Gaudeul, who explains that the reason he set about compiling 
Encounters and Clashes came from his experiences working in an African 
country [Tanzania] (1999:cover), said he discovered that ‘Unexpectedly, […] a 
Muslim would quote a modern author whom few Priests if any, in that country, 
had heard of’ (1990: i). He names Maurice Bucaille (The Bible, The Qur’an and 
Science) as an example of an author being quoted. To illustrate the truth of this, 
Aziz (1998) quotes Deedat, Bucaille, Mawdūdī, ʿAtʿur-Rahim, also Harnack and 
Schillebeeckx.
Gaudeul (1990: 332–7) translates a tract published in Mombasa in 1962, Kwa 
nini sikuwa Mkristo (Why I am not a Christian), by Maalim Said bin Ahmad 
and published by the Muslim Youth Cultural Society, which is purportedly 
responding to a letter from a Christian. The tract seeks to differentiate between 
Paul’s Religion and the Christianity of Jesus. It is a common approach used 
in Muslim polemics to attack Paul as the ‘perverter’ of the message of Jesus, 
arguing that if Jesus’s message had been followed, Christians would have rec-
ognised Muḥammad as being sent by God and that Islam was the fulfilment of 
the message given by Jesus. A tract with a similar approach Kwa nini niliacha 
Ukristo (Why I left Christianity) by Abbas Gombo Kanoni is examined below 
in detail (see chapter 9).
Another example is Mtume Muhammad katika Vitabu Vitakatifu (The 
Apostle Muḥammad in the Holy Books), written by al-Amin b. Aly, 3rd printing 
1955, which begins:
Ushuhuda wa Vitabu Vitakatifu kwa Mtume Muhammad. Twaonesha 
hapa ushahidi kidogo wa vitabu vitakatifu vinavyoaminiwani [sic] 
Wakristo wote Protestant na Romani [sic] Catholic, uonesha kwamba 
Mtume Muhammad ndie Mtume wa haki aliyekuwa akitarajiwa kuja 
baada ya Bwana Isa Masihi.
The witness of the Holy Books to the Apostle Muḥammad. We show here 
a small part of the evidence of the Holy Books that are believed by all 
Christians Protestant and Roman Catholic, showing that the Apostle 
Muḥammad is truly the Apostle who was expected to come after the Lord 
Jesus the Messiah.

Chapter 4
This example illustrates an aspect of many Muslim tracts, using the Bible to 
show the alleged veracity of Islam. Issues such as these are raised in several of 
the tracts examined below.
A valuable source of information concerning Muslim tracts that were avail-
able in East Africa in 1960 is A Report on Islam in Kenya for The Department of 
Biblical Study and Research of Christian Council of Kenya, written by Bethwell 
Kiplagat and Sigvard von Sicard, as a part of the preparations for setting up the 
Islam in Africa Project.
In Pierre Benignus’ report on his journey, concerning East Africa he wrote:
The Christian Council of Kenya, aware of the problem, has set aside in its 
budget a sum for a three-months’ study in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. 
The presence in Tanganyika of Pastor von Sicard, an expert who at the 
moment has a missionary post, should permit this plan being carried out 
in 1960. The Lutheran World Federation, to which he belongs, has been 
asked to release him for this enquiry. In addition it is planned to appoint 
an African student from Makerere College as his fellow-worker.
Benignus, 1959: 28
Bethwell Kiplagat, then a student at Makerere College, and later to become a 
distinguished Kenyan diplomat,2 accompanied Sigvard von Sicard, a Swedish 
Lutheran missionary working in Tanganyika. They travelled around Kenya and 
the report gives an invaluable ‘snapshot’ of Islam in Kenya at the end of the 
colonial era; it details Muslim presence and activities throughout Kenya and 
would repay further analysis.

this work by al-Farsy, published in 1989].
Kiplagat and von Sicard, 1960: 32
The list includes the early juzuu of al-Farsy’s Qur’an Takatifu as well as some of 
his best-known works, many of which are still available, almost seventy years 
later.
These works by Muslims, listed by Kiplagat and von Sicard, show that 
Muslims were producing material and that they were as adept at using the 
printed medium to disseminate ideas as were Christians.

New Methods of Muslim Outreach
In the early 1960s, the writings of Ahmed Hoosen Deedat (1918–2005), who was 
based in South Africa, began to appear in East Africa. One example, printed in 
South Africa in English and available in Mombasa is: Muhammad (PBUH) in 
the Old and New Testaments. Lacunza Balda (1997: 101) refers to a Swahili trans-
lation of this text, Mtume Muhammad katika Biblia (The Apostle Muḥammad 
in the Bible), dated 1965. Other Deedat tracts that have been translated into 
Swahili include: Biblia asema nini juu ya Muhammad (S.A.W.)3 (What does 
the Bible say about Muḥammad (P.B.U.H.), dated 1988 (Lacunza Balda, 
1997: 101); Adam Traders of Mombasa lists several titles including Uislamu 
katika Biblia (Islam in the Bible); Je! Yesu Alisulubiwa? (Was Jesus Crucified?). 
Audio-cassettes and, more recently, videos of Deedat’s debates and talks are 
popular and have been widely distributed in both Kenya and Tanzania.

Muslim Tracts in East Africa
Ahmed Deedat, who founded the Islamic Propagation Centre International 
(IPCI), was based in Durban, South Africa. He developed the Comparative 
Religions Approach, using the Bible to attack Christianity and to demonstrate 
the truth of Islam. His approach can be described as ‘Apologetics through 
Polemics’ (Westerlund, 2003: 263). He was born in Surat, India, joining his 
father in South Africa in 1927, where he attended school as far as standard six, 
but was unable to continue further due to lack of finances (Vahed, 2005: 88).
Deedat explained that his zeal to attack Christianity began in 1939. Whilst 
working in a store at Adams Mission, he was stung by the insults to Islam 
thrown at him by trainee Christian missionaries. He was looking in the back of 
the store for reading matter, when he ‘discovered by pure chance’ a dusty copy 
of Iẓhar al-Ḥaqq (The Demonstration of Truth) by Raḥmat Allāh al-Kayrānawī. 
He used this to debate with the trainee missionaries and it became the basis of 
his own approach (Deedat, 1992a: 62; Vahed, 2013: 31–2).
From this beginning he went on to write booklets challenging the truth 
of the Bible and Christianity, and to hold debates with Christian Evangelists 
throughout the world. His populist polemical style has been well received by 
many Muslims (Lockhat, 1994: 1–2). Brian Larkin examined Deedat’s methods, 
calling them ‘Islamic evangelism’ (2008: 101). Samadia Sadouni (1997, 1998, 
2007, 2011), David Westerlund (2003) and Goolam Vahed (2013) have written 
about Deedat in detail.
A visit to Tanzania by Deedat is described by H.M. Njozi. He reports how, 
in June 1981, as Secretary General of the Muslim Students Association of the 
University of Dar es Salaam (MSAUD), he invited Ahmed Deedat to speak at a 
conference in Dar es Salaam, where Deedat gave a lecture on Muḥammad in 
the Bible. Further, Njozi reports that after the first lecture, six Catholic sem-
inarians embraced Islam and pressure was put on MSAUD to cancel the sec-
ond lecture, following a letter to the leadership of Baraza Kuu la Waislamu 
waTanzania (Supreme Council of Muslims of Tanzania, (BAKWATA)), by both 
Tanzanian Episcopal Conference (TEC) and CCT. Njozi reports that he went to 
the Vice-President to ask him to allow the meeting to go ahead and that four 
Christians embraced Islam at that meeting (Njozi, 2000: 11–12). The visit meant 
that many Muslims were exposed to Deedat’s methods and style of polemical 
preaching. Tanzanian preachers have followed the approach used by Deedat, 
notably Mussa Fundi Ngariba and Mohammed Ali Kawemba whose Uislam 
katika Biblia (Islam in the Bible) is one of the tracts examined below.
Ahmed Deedat returned to East Africa again in May 1993 when he spent 
one week in Kenya, speaking in Nairobi and Mombasa. In addition to the talks, 
which were conducted in the evening, mainly in mosques, he also ran training 
sessions known as Combat Kit Classes. These classes were held in the morning,

restricted to a small group, with a separate class for women. Each participant 
was given a Bible and Deedat then took them through the booklet Combat Kit 
Against Bible Thumpers, showing them which passages of the Bible to use in 
order to respond to questions from Christians. These talks and training ses-
sions were videoed and are available for viewing through the Truthway TV web-
site (https://truthway.tv/en/deedat/index.html). His pamphlets, in English, are 
also available through the same website. They give an insight into the methods 
used by Deedat and indicate his influence on many of the Muslim preachers in 
East Africa who seek to emulate him (Chesworth, 2011a, 2011b, 2013).
The chapter has looked at how Muslims, in East Africa, began producing 
tracts to propagate their faith, using Swahili in order to ensure that it was 
clearly understood. More work needs to be done to assess the contents of these 
tracts and their purpose. In publishing selected essays from Mazrui’s Uwongozi, 
Kresse and Mwakimako (2016) have given a model for others to use in looking 
at the writings of other Muslim authors, such as al-Farsy and Kasim Mazrui.
Having looked at the history of tracts produced in East Africa, by Muslims 
and Christians, we now look at Swahili as a religious language and the versions 
of the Bible and Qurʾān in Swahili.

Chapter 5
Swahili as a Religious Language
1	
Introduction
In order to examine Swahili as a religious language and its use in outreach lit-
erature in East Africa, it is helpful to understand its origins.
Swahili is a language which originally developed among the people of the 
East African Coast. It is also known as Kiswahili; the prefix ki- is used to indi-
cate language, the prefix u- indicates place, and the prefix m-/wa- indicates 
person/people. Swahili is one of the Bantu family of languages, which Farouk 
Topan defines as:
[L]anguages which are spoken in the southern third of Africa, from 
Cameroon and Kenya to South Africa. The languages share striking fea-
tures of grammar – all nouns, for example, belong to one of a number of 
concord-classes, with characteristic prefixes and agreements and a con-
siderable common lexicon.
Topan, 1999: 917
Grammatically, Swahili is Bantu in structure, but a significant proportion 
of the vocabulary is Arabic in origin. Derek Nurse writes ‘Assessment of the 
Arabic component [in Swahili] […] ranges from ca. 20% to 50% of the total 
vocabulary’ (Nurse, 1997: 277), whilst I. Bosha claims that 44.3% of Swahili 
words have an Arabic origin (Bosha, 1990: 39). The Arabic element in Swahili 
is an important consideration in this study, as its presence has influenced the 
religious language used by Muslims and Christians. Whilst this research is not 
intended to focus on linguistics, it is necessary to have some understanding of 
the way in which the language has developed and spread.
Ali and Alamin Mazrui describe Swahili as having developed through four 
distinct stages:
The Islamic stage, when the language culturally and idiomatically was 
associated closely with Islam.
The ecumenical stage, when the language also came to serve the pur-
poses of Christianity.
The secular stage, when the main influences on the language have 
been non-religious and when its role has been overwhelmingly secular.

The universalist stage, when the language has become the most widely 
used African language
adapted from Mazrui and Mazrui, 1998: 126
Changes in Swahili as a language came about as it evolved, the result of the 
new requirements put upon it. Mazrui and Mazrui discuss its evolution into an 
ecumenical language:
[A] medium of worship and theology for Christianity and indigenous 
African religion, as well as Islam. Kiswahili is now the language of a 
Christian hymn, of an Islamic sermon, and of funeral rites in African tra-
ditional creeds. Swahili religious concepts which were originally intended 
only for Muslim discourse have now penetrated the vocabulary of the 
Bible and of African initiation rites. The ecumenicalization of Kiswahili 
is part and parcel of its universalization.
Mazrui and Mazrui, 1998: 171
Topan discusses the Islamic and Christian stages in terms of how they had an 
influence on Swahili. He identifies three different possible ways in which Islam 
had an influence on Islamic Swahili:
6.	 (i)		
The original Arabic term was Swahilised, e.g. rūḥ (Ar.) >roho (Sw.) 
[Spirit]
(ii)	 The original Arabic term was Swahilised and, additionally, given a 
Bantu synonym, e.g. rasūl (Ar.) >rasuli/mtume (Sw.) [Messenger/
Apostle]
(iii)	 The original Arabic term was generally not adopted but the con-
cept was given a Swahili term, [e.g. Allāh (Ar.) >Mngu/Mungu 
(Sw.) [God]
adapted from Topan, 1992: 335
The influence of Christianity on the language is further discussed below, when 
examples of some of the problems that the early missionary translators faced 
are examined.
Until the coming of Christian missionaries and European colonisers in the 
second half of the nineteenth century, Swahili was written using Arabic script. 
The missionaries and colonial authorities generally chose to use Roman script. 
Orthography and spelling varied between dialects and mission. If Swahili was 
to become the lingua franca of the region there was a need to standardise 
Swahili.

Swahili as a Religious Language

Standardising Swahili
The colonial powers, Britain and Germany, used Swahili as a language of 
administration and communication and this influenced its development as a 
language.
The colonial authorities in the Belgian Congo also used Swahili as an official 
language for the South-Eastern parts of the country. The story of its introduc-
tion and development as a distinct language, together with its significance in 
the colonial politics of the Congo are related in Language and colonial power: 
the appropriation of Swahili in the Belgian Congo, 1880–1938, Johannes Fabian 
(1986). Christian missionaries had mainly used Roman script for their Bible 
translations and educational books, however some publishing was done using 
Arabic script, e.g. St. John’s Gospel in Swahili (Arabic Script), BFBS by W.E. Taylor 
(1897).
The decision to use only Roman script for Swahili was made by the colo-
nial authorities at the end of the 19th Century. In German East Africa this 
was decided in the 1890s following the visit of Inspector Winkellman in 1893, 
who saw the Christian missions using Roman script and recommended the 
change to the government which was using Arabic script for announcements 
in Swahili (von Sicard, 1970: 159). The Mazruis explain that during the 1905 
Colonial Congress, Carl Meinhof ‘proposed that Kiswahili be dis-Islamized 
[sic] by replacing the Arabic script […] with the Roman script and Arabic loan 
words with German terms’ (Mazrui and Mazrui, 1995: 39).
After the First World War, the idea of a standard form of Swahili gained 
ground as the British now controlled Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, and Tanganyika 
(Mazrui and Mazrui, 1995: 44). The formal process of standardisation of Swahili 
began in 1925, with an Inter-Territorial Conference of the Committee for the 
Standardisation of the Swahili Language, which sat at Dar es Salaam and chose 
the Zanzibar dialect of Swahili, Kiunguja, rather than Kimvita of Mombasa or 
any of the other dialects, as standard Swahili, and regularised the orthography 
of Swahili in Roman script (Broomfield, 1930: 77–80; Wright, 1965: 48). A fuller 
account of the process of standardising Swahili is given by Wilfred Whiteley in 
Swahili: The Rise of a National Language (1969) chapter five, pages 79–96.
In the ‘Notes and News’ section of Africa (April 1931) there is a summary of 
the Inter-territorial Language Committee Resolutions and it was noted that:
An Inter-Territorial Language Committee had been formed […] The first 
meeting was held in Nairobi, Kenya Colony, April 1930 […] That the stand-
ard Swahili is that which was adopted by the Committee for the stand-
ardization of the Swahili Language which sat at Dar es Salaam in 1925,

which was subsequently confirmed by a Conference held at Mombasa in 
1928, […] The gist of the resolutions [is]:-
‘That the Zanzibar dialect with such modification as may be required 
be adopted as the standard form of Swahili.
That in deciding on the modification, Bantu words be employed wher-
ever possible, but due regard should be paid to Arabic words and those of 
other foreign languages which are established and have become part and 
parcel of the Swahili language.
That pending their revision, Steere’s Swahili Exercises and the gram-
matical portions of Steere’s Handbook are recommended as being 
the most suitable for adoption as standard grammars, and Madan’s 
Dictionaries as a standard work.
Notes and News, 1931: 239–40
It seems that one aspect of the standardising of Swahili and of using Roman 
script was to ‘de-Islamise’ the language. Mission schools taught using vernac-
ulars: many missionaries still regarded Swahili as too Islamic. The Colonial 
authorities had to impose the use of Swahili in education (Iliffe, 1979: 339; 
Mazrui and Mazrui, 1995: 47).
From this time, Swahili, using Roman script, became the usual medium for 
printed works. Following the standardisation of Swahili and the establishment 
of the Inter-territorial Language (Swahili) Committee (ILC), all books that 
were to be published and to be used in government schools were submitted 
to them for approval. G.W. Broomfield, writing in January 1931, explains that:
The four territories now have shauri moja (one policy) with regard to 
Swahili. A permanent secretary has been appointed, also ‘readers’ in each 
territory who revise all Swahili books and manuscripts submitted to them 
on the lines of the principles of standardization already agreed upon. In 
future no books will be used in Government and assisted schools of East 
Africa unless they have been approved, with regard to their Swahili, by 
the Inter-territorial Language Committee.
Broomfield, 1931: 84–5
The inside title page of books published in the territory included an impri-
matur from the ILC. An example of this is Historia ya Kibiblia: Katika Lugha 
ya Kiswahili, published by the Lutheran Church in 1956, which has this 
statement:

Swahili as a Religious Language
The Swahili in which this book is written has been approved by the 
Interterritorial [sic] Language (Swahili) Committee for the East Africa 
Dependencies.
B.J. Ratcliffe, Secretary, I.L.C. (1956: Title Page)
Interestingly, Broomfield adds that ‘No pressure will be brought to bear upon 
the missions with regard to the Swahili of their religious books, but they will 
hardly seek to perpetuate types of Swahili which will rapidly become obsolete’ 
(Broomfield, 1931: 85). This may well explain why the mission sought approval 
for the above example, as it would want the book to be available for use in 
schools.
Arabic script continued to be used, as Robin Lamburn reports that dur-
ing the 1930s in Tunduru, Southern Tanganyika, many had: ‘no knowledge of 
the Roman script, but who are fluent in the reading and writing of Swahili in 
Arabic script’ (King, Fiedler and White, 1991: 125). J.W.T. Allen, writing in 1945, 
in his Introduction to Arabic Script for Students of Swahili, commends the study 
of Swahili written in Arabic script for the following reasons:
A man will often tell you that he cannot read or write, because believing 
you to be unable to read “Kiswahili” [Swahili], he assumes that you are 
asking him only about “Kizungu” [any European language]. If this fact 
were realized the literacy figures for East Africa would be found to be 
very different from those that will be found in reports. As soon as it is 
discovered that you can manage the script a surprisingly large amount of 
correspondence will begin to appear, not with educated Arab or Arabized 
people on the Coast only, but with persons who would normally be 
assumed without question to be illiterate.
Allen, 1945: 5
Allen was also concerned that Swahili speakers should be able to read Swahili 
in Roman script; in 1938 he published Maandiko ya Kizungu: yaani kitabu cha 
kusomea herufi wanazozitumia wazungu (Writing of Swahili [in Roman script]: 
that is a book to read the letters that are used by Europeans). Kizungu was 
also used to refer to Standardised Swahili by those used to using Arabic script 
(Khalid, 1977: 155).
From this it can be deduced that producing tracts in Swahili in Arabic script, 
such as Raha isiyo Karaha, had a real purpose, in that initially they would be 
readily understood by more people than were able to understand Swahili in 
Roman script.

Chapter 5
More recently there has been a movement to re-introduce Swahili in Arabic 
script. In 1997 Yahya Ali Omar (with P.J.L. Frankl) published ‘An Historical 
Review of the Arabic Rendering of Swahili Together with Proposals for the 
Development of a Swahili Writing System in Arabic Script’, which details the 
history of Arabic script and the opposition to it, together with a detailed argu-
ment for its re-introduction.
At much the same time, Ali Muhsin al-Barwani in his preface to Tarjama ya 
Al-Muntakhab katika tafsiri ya Qur’ani tukufu (1995 and 2000) presented the 
case for the re-introduction of the use of Arabic script for Swahili.
Kazi tuliyonayo [ni] […] Kufundisha watu kutumia harufi za Kiarabu 
kuandikia Kiswahili kama walivyokuwa wakiandika wote hapo zamani 
kabla ya kuja wakoloni. […] Kwa majaribio yangu nimeweza kuwafundi-
sha vijana kadhaa wakadhaa wa Kitanzania kusoma na kuandika kwa 
harufi za Kiarabu kwa muda wa siku chache tu na wakaweza kuisoma 
Qurʾani popote nilipowafungulia. Nimetunga kijitabu juu ya hayo nili-
chokiita: “Jifunze Kusoma na Kuandika Kiarabu kwa Wiki Tatu”, ambacho 
kimepigwa chapa.
Al-Barwani, 2000: viii
The work that we have is […] To teach people to use Arabic letters to 
write Swahili as they all did before the coming of the colonials. […] As 
an experiment I have been able to teach various Tanzanian youth to read 
and write using Arabic letters in only a few days and they were able to 
read the Qurʾān wherever I opened it. I have written a booklet concerning 
this which I have called: Jifunze Kusoma na Kuandika Kiarabu kwa Wiki 
Tatu [Learn to read and write Arabic in three weeks], which is already 
published.1
Since that was written, Kiswahili (Swahili using Arabic characters), a small dic-
tionary, was published in 2003 in Zanzibar by A.O. Mohamed and A. Owhida. 
In these two books, the Swahili used is closer to that of Zanzibar Swahili than 
standard Swahili.
John Mungane in The story of Swahili, 2015, examines the history of the lan-
guage and gives a helpful overview of colonialism and the standardisation of 
Swahili (2015: 192–226).

Christian Missionaries’ Translational Labours
3.1	
Problems Facing Christian Missionaries When Translating 
into Swahili
In the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries arrived in East Africa before 
the European powers began to ‘scramble for Africa’. Protestant missionaries, 
in particular, were adamant that ‘the Word of God’ needed to be understood 
by those being evangelised. Early missionaries, such as Krapf and Steere, were 
involved in translation work. They produced grammars and lexicons as well as 
primers, in order to teach others Swahili as a written language. The impetus 
for this was to then produce a version of the Bible in Swahili, as well as other 
religious material.
The question of the best way to translate the Bible, and questions as to how 
to find suitable words in Swahili for Bible translation, arose at various levels.
Three examples are given to illustrate some of the issues that were faced by 
early translators:
3.1.1	
Miss Barton’s Understanding of Swahili
Mabel Barton was accepted for service by CMS in February 1888, at the age 
of 22. She undertook preparatory training at The Willows, the CMS training 
college for women in north London, and in July 1889 set off for the Eastern 
Equatorial Africa Mission, based in Frere Town. In her annual report to CMS in 
1890, Miss Mabel Barton, who was teaching children in Mombasa, complained 
of the paucity of Swahili language as a means of communicating the message 
of Christianity.
A class which would simply be play if given in English, becomes a hard 
lesson in Swahili to the teacher out here. The language is so poor, one 
word having to do duty for six English ones. For instance, they use the 
same word for God’s throne in heaven as they use for a tiny three-legged 
stool [kiti] – all the chair they know of. What idea of the throne can they 
have? Also crown [kilemba] is the same word as turban. The children have 
never seen a crown, and must imagine that ‘a crown for little children’ is 
something like the head-gear worn by the Arabs! The idea of ‘sacrifice’ 
[dhabihu] too – I wonder when they can take it in at all. The word used 
for ‘offerings’ [sadaka] means to them putting a few pice [coins of small 
value] in the bag on Sundays. We think they must have wonderful intel-
lects to have grasped what they have, and of course it falls upon us to 
explain these words, which is not easy in a new language.
CMS Proceedings, 1891: 48

Chapter 5
In writing this, Miss Barton demonstrates her own incomplete understand-
ing of Swahili and the nuances that it is capable of. Her description of kiti 
as meaning both God’s throne and three-legged stool is an example. Kiti cha 
enzi – literally chair of authority – would be used for God’s throne, whereas a 
kiti chenye miguu mitatu – chair having three legs – could be used for stool, but 
in fact kigoda (three legged stool) and kikalio (small seat) differentiate stools 
from chairs. It is to be noted that neither of the dictionaries by Krapf (1882) and 
Madan (1903) give these latter words as alternatives. Similarly, the other words 
she mentions would be better understood than she supposes.
Part of her ‘ignorance’ at the time she wrote may well have been that, as she 
had only arrived in East Africa in July 1889 (CMS Register, 1904: 277), she would 
have had only a limited amount of time to learn Swahili. That, despite this, 
CMS still published her remarks in their Proceedings perhaps reflects the desire 
of the mission to use such reports, however naïve they may now appear, so as 
to provide information for the supporters ‘at home’.
In 1890 she married Arthur Smith, an ordained CMS Missionary who had 
been in the mission field since 1887; they retired from the mission in 1903 (CMS 
Register, 1904: 277, 217).
3.1.2	
Isa Masiya or Yesu Kristo?
A major issue for the Christian missions was to decide what words should be 
used for Jesus Christ in Swahili. Should it follow the Arabic form, ʿĪsā al-Masīḥ 
(Isa Masiya, in Swahili) the title that Muslims in East Africa were familiar with? 
Or should it be based on the Greek, Yesu Kristo? The different mission agencies 
and publishers had different views, with UMCA favouring Isa Masiya and CMS 
favouring Yesu Kristo. This led, in 1894, to SPCK refusing to publish a Swahili 
hymn book prepared by W.E. Taylor because he used ‘Jesu’ (CMS Precis Book G3 
A5 P4: 1892–1895: 23.10.1894: item 196). The issue remained unresolved, partly 
because of the inability of missionaries from CMS and UMCA to agree to dis-
cuss revisions of Bible translations, even though the Home Committees actu-
ally encouraged them to. In April 1892, R. Lang and F.E. Wigram from CMS head 
office wrote to Taylor telling him to organise a conference to meet with UMCA 
and to discuss revisions, as had been suggested by the Committee two and a 
half years previously (CMS Out-going Letters Book G3 A5 L6: 1890–1893: 304). 
One reason for the disagreement having arisen was their use of different dia-
lects of Swahili, CMS using Kimvita and UMCA using Kiunguja. The Frere Town 
Translational sub-committee, meeting in 1894, ‘saw no prospect of compro-
mise on the part of the Universities’ Mission with regard to translation’ (CMS 
Precis Book G3 A5 P4: 1892–1895: 23.10.1894: item 195).

Swahili as a Religious Language
This failure to come to an agreement on a common translation for Jesus 
Christ in Swahili led, in 1906, to a meeting organized at the behest of the 
then Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, between CMS and UMCA 
together with SPCK and BFBS, who were both publishing Bibles in Swahili. 
Frederick Baylis from CMS then wrote to Bishops Peel and Tucker to let them 
know of the discussions.
Letter from F. Baylis to Bishops Tucker and Peel, February 8th 1906.
Swahili rendering of Our Lord’s Name. – We were approached the 
other day with a request from the S.P.C.K. to send representatives to a 
small Conference the Archbishop was gathering at Lambeth Palace to 
consider the question of the usage in East Africa as to the Title for Our 
Lord in S.P.C.K. publications. The matter arose, it seems through the 
Universities Mission asking the S.P.C.K. to produce the prayer-book in 
which the title for Our Lord was to be a transliteration of ‘Jesus Christ,’ 
(Yesu Kristo) instead of some form of the Arabic words for ‘Jesus, The 
Messiah.’ (Isa, Masiya). The S.P.C.K. were bound to get the Archbishop’s 
concurrence: and when he knew how usually in other English Missions 
in the neighbourhood the Semitic form prevails and not the Greek, he 
felt it was a matter on which consultation was necessary. We have had 
the Conference (Mr. Binns and Mr. Blackledge representing our expert 
knowledge; Mr. Sharp of the B. & F.B.S. was also present), and evidently 
the Archbishop felt it was no easy matter for him to decide; and when 
someone suggested that it would be possible for three, if not all the four 
East African Bishops to meet at home this year, he took to the idea of 
inviting the Bishop of Zanzibar specially to England that he might meet 
with you and Bishop Tucker/Peel, and possibly the Bishop of Likoma, 
who is now at home. At His Grace’s request, I am writing to tell you that 
he hopes you will be willing to give him the help of your advice when you 
are home, and suggests that you should, if you are able, prepare yourself 
for the consultation by getting beforehand what you are able in the shape 
of any united opinion from your Mission. I might say that, so far as I could 
gather, the drift of thought in the Conference we have had, there was a 
very general feeling that a different spelling than ‘Isa Masiya’ is clearly 
advisable: but the larger question before the Archbishop was whether the 
whole set of terms – Christ, Christian, Christianity, Christmas, &c. – are 
to be recast in one or more of the East African languages. I suppose ruling 
questions will be, whether uniformity over so large an area as that includ-
ing Swahili, Luganda and kindred dialects must be aimed at, and, if so,

whether it is wisest to retain the Semitic or admit the Greek. The Bishop 
of Zanzibar seems to say that only the C.M.S. Missions, to his knowledge, 
retain now the Semitic; but Mr. Blackledge was able to quote the Roman 
Catholics in Uganda, while he had to say also that he thought some 
strength of opinion was growing in Uganda (against his own opinion) 
that the Greek form should be introduced. There seems to be much evi-
dence that even in Bantu languages as well as in languages of other groups 
where Mohammedanism does not prevail, the Greek form has been cus-
tomary. In that respect the position which prevails in India seems to have 
reproduced itself in Africa, though touch with Mohammedanism seems 
naturally to have led to the Semitic usage, while many Mohammedan dis-
tricts have transliterated the Greek. Mr. Sharp seemed to suggest that no 
strong effort should be made to divert people from this historical usage, 
but that, in cases where the matter was in question, as in the Universities 
Mission in East Africa, it might be possible, while printing one form of 
phrase in a text, to show by marginal notes that it was the equivalent to 
the other, and that the other could if desired, be used instead.

The use of the ‘Semitic’ (Arabic) titles seemed to have proponents from 
amongst the CMS groups, whereas UMCA appeared to prefer the Greek, an 
apparent shift from the discussions reported in 1894. The discussion seems to 
have taken into account the Muslim usage of Isa Masiya, as well as the use by 
other Bantu languages of Yesu Kristo. The Greek transliteration was adopted 
and is used by all the translations of the Bible now in circulation.
The difference of opinion between CMS and UMCA could well have been 
the result of the mutual suspicion and antagonism between the two socie-
ties, due to their different ‘churchmanship’, as well as their preferred Swahili 
dialects. This is seen, at a later date, in the correspondence during the 1940s 
between the translators of the Union Version where they argued that the others 
did not know Swahili, fuelled by the differences between Kimvita and Kiunguja 
(Mojola, 1999: 71).
Walbert Bühlmann, in his section on Jesus Christus (1950: 219–22), dis-
cusses the use of Yesu by Christian missions and states that Yesu is used in all 
Catholic books as well as in Protestant books. He appears to be unaware of the 
discussions between UMCA and CMS; he does however also note the use of 
Isa [Aisa] in Extraits des Lettres Circulaires by Mgr. H. Streicher, published in 
1909. Bühlmann also cites the Catechism by R.P. Baur, Zanzibar, 1867 as using

221–2).
In the texts to be examined the tract writers use both Isa and Yesu; in the 
translations into English these have been retained to show what was used in 
the original Swahili text. Some writers in fact switch between the two usages 
within a paragraph.
3.1.3	
What Word Can Be Used for ‘Holy’?
When translating the Bible and the key concepts of faith, early translators had 
problems finding words which gave the right sense for a concept. This led to 
some words being used which perhaps do not actually give the idea that the 
translators were looking for. For example, the early translators of the Bible 
into Kikuyu, from 1904–18 regularly met as a committee comprising CMS and 
Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) missionaries. They met in the mornings 
and then discussed problems of translation in the afternoon with Kikuyu stu-
dents of the school (CSM Barlow Papers 1786/5, Minutes of the United Kikuyu 
Language Committee, of May 22nd 1908).
When the Kimeru translation of the Bible was being prepared, a decision 
over the word for Holy Spirit was made and Kirundu U’mutheru was chosen; 
Kirundu does give the meaning of spirit in Kimeru, however it has the sense of 
‘evil-spirit’ and as such was not the best word to use; more recent translations 
use Mwoyo Mũkembu (Jamleck Gikunda: personal communication, July 2007).
P.J.L. Frankl and Yahya Ali Omar, in a paper ‘The Idea of “the Holy” in Swahili’, 
examine the question of what word to use for ‘Holy’ in Swahili.
It is sometimes said that the Bantu languages have a preference for con-
crete words and a paucity of abstract concepts, and, indeed, there is no 
entry for ‘holy’ […] in Guthrie’s Comparative Bantu (1971). However it 
would be quite wrong to deduce […] that the concept of ‘holy’ is absent 
in the Bantu family of languages. The Swahili language is a member of 
that family and […] may be described as an Islamic language. So it is not 
in the least remarkable that Christian collocations of ‘holy’ such as Holy 
Ghost, Holy Orders, Holy Communion are not to be found in kiSwahili 
cha kiSwahili [Swahili language as used by Swahili speakers, that is, not a 
neologism]. But what of the very word ‘holy’? Is there a lexical equivalent 
in kiSwahili cha kiSwahili?
The available evidence suggests that in the mid-nineteenth century, at 
the second-coming of the European-Christians to the East African coast, 
there was no lexical equivalent for ‘holy’, or its near synonym ‘sacred’, in

the spoken language of the Swahili people. To claim thus is not so much to 
comment on an apparent lacuna in the lexis of the Swahili language, but 
rather to remark on a conceptual difference in the Islamic and Christian 
use of language. This is because Swahili has other ways of expressing the 
idea that persons, books, places and times are ‘holy’. […]
In Krapf’s Swahili-English dictionary in four large manuscript vol-
umes dated 1846–1853, there is no entry for takatifu, although -takasa, 
-takata, and -takatika are all included. Had the derived form takatifu 
been in existence in the 1840s Krapf would have included it. [In Krapf’s 
published dictionary takatifu occurs, together with examples of use: roho 
takatifu Holy Ghost; utakatifu holiness (Krapf, 1882: 355).] […] It is proba-
ble, therefore, that the word takatifu was invented (derived from -takata) 
for or by European-Christian missionaries some time between 1853 and 
1870 when it appears in Steere’s Handbook. […]
In the second half of the nineteenth century European-Christian 
missionaries coming to the eastern coast of Africa must have found 
the lexis of the Swahili language ‘wanting’ for the primary task of Bible 
translation and ‘wanting’ too, of course, for a good many liturgical terms. 
The word ‘holy’, for example had biblical and liturgical importance for 
European-Christian missionaries in East Africa, whatever their denomi-
nation. But how was ‘holy’ to be translated in Swahili? One obvious pos-
sibility is that a missionary took the stem of the intransitive verb -takata 
‘be thoroughly clean’, and transformed it into an adjective by suffixing -fu, 
giving takatifu ‘holy’, and then changed it into an abstract noun by means 
of the prefix -u, giving utakatifu ‘holiness’, or into a concrete noun with 
the prefix m- ‘a holy person, a saint’. Alternatively, these linguistic gym-
nastics may have been performed by an obliging Swahili who had an 
understanding of what was required.
Edward Steere, […] did a great deal of Bible translation […] with par-
ticular reference to ‘holy’ in Swahili, it should be noted that, in Isaiah 6:3, 
for example, he translated the threefold repetition of the Hebrew qadōsh 
‘holy’, as takatifu. Likewise in ‘as he spoke by the mouth of his holy 
Prophets’ (Luke 1:70), ‘holy’ is rendered by watakatifu.
Frankl and Omar, 1999: 109–11
An extended extract from Frankl and Omar has been given as it explains in 
detail the processes that were undertaken to ‘create’ a word to give the idea of 
‘Holy’ in Swahili. It is of note that when Muslim writers have given the mean-
ing of the Qurʾān in Swahili they have also followed Christian writers and used 
takatifu, rather than forming a Swahili word based on the Arabic qudus.

Swahili as a Religious Language
Walbert Bühlmann, in a section headed Heiligkeit (1950: 293–300), discusses 
the use of takatifu, recording its use by Krapf in his manuscript translation of 
the Epistle to the Romans, which Bühlmann dates as 1845, and in a Catholic 
Catechism prepared by Etienne Baur of the Holy Ghost Fathers (HGF), pub-
lished in Zanzibar in 1867 (Bühlmann, 1950: 298). Bühlmann gives the title of 
the Catechism prepared by Baur as Katekismou Kisouahili na Kifranza tcha 
Vasouahili na Vatoumoua oua Angoudia na Mrima oua Souahili. Catéchisme 
Souahili et Français pour les Souahili et les Noirs de la Côte Orientale d’Afrique. 
Par le R.P. Baur, Zanzibar 1867. Paul Kollman discusses the production of the 
Catechism by pére Etienne (2005: 96–7).
The use by Krapf of takatifu as early as 1845, when it is not in the manu-
script version of his dictionary, is odd. Baur’s use in 1867 accords with Frankl 
and Omar’s supposition that it came into use before its appearance in Steere’s 
Handbook published in 1870 (1999: 109–14).

Translating the Word
When Ludwig Krapf first arrived in Mombasa, in 1844, he was not initially 
aware that Swahili was in fact a written language.
At Mombas Dr. Krapf studied the Sooahelee [Swahili] and Wonica lan-
guages. Sooahelee he considers indispensable, whether the Missionary 
proceed to the Galla [Oromo] or other Tribes along the coast. Neither of 
these languages has been reduced to writing.
CMS Proceedings, 1845: 49
This may well have been because it was written using Arabic script, so from a 
cursory inspection, the differences between Swahili and Arabic as languages 
may not have been apparent, particularly in Kimvita. The misunderstanding 
that Krapf was the first to render Swahili into a written form continued. Cedric 
Frank, writing in 1952 about Edward Steere, wrote ‘It must not be thought that 
Steere was the founder of written Swahili. Previous work on the language had 
already been done by Dr Krapf […]’ (Frank, 1952: 38). Krapf was diligent in his 
language work and embarked on translating parts of the Bible and compiling a 
dictionary. The annual reports note his progress on the translation of books of 
the Bible and of material for a dictionary.
Translational Labours. In the work of translation Dr Krapf has espe-
cially abounded, as will be seen from the following enumeration of the 
manuscripts which he has sent home. The book of Genesis, the Acts of 
the Apostles, the Epistles to the Romans, Galatians, and Ephesians, the

General Epistles of St. Peter, and the First General Epistle of St. John, in 
the Sooahelee language; and the Gospels of St. Luke and St. John in both 
the Sooahelee and Wonica languages. He has also compiled a Dictionary, 
containing 10,000 words of the Sooahelee, Wonica, and Wakamba lan-
guages; and has prepared a Grammar of the same languages for the use 
of future Missionaries.
CMS Proceedings, 1846: 53–4
He later reflected that his initial work needed extensive revision.
Translational Labours. In this department Dr. Krapf has been most assid-
uously employed, whenever his health and other engagements have per-
mitted. In little more than two years he has translated nearly the whole 
of the New Testament into the Sooahelee language. He is desirous, how-
ever, that no part of it should be printed until he shall have brought his 
maturer acquaintance with the language to bear upon a careful revision 
of it. He has sent home a Vocabulary, containing about 2200 words in 
the Sooahelee, Wonica, Pokomo and Galla languages; and is engaged on 
a very extensive Sooahelee Dictionary. The letters A and B, which he has 
finished, contain about 4000 words.
CMS Proceedings, 1847: 50
His translation of Chapters 1–3 of Genesis was published in 1847. Then, in 1851, 
An Outline of the Elements of the Kisuahéli language, with special reference to 
the Kinika dialect and A Vocabulary of six East-African languages – Kisuahéli, 
Kikámba, Kipokómo, Kiháua, and Kigálla were published by CMS at 2/6 and 5 
shillings (CMS Proceedings, 1851: 125).
Krapf continued developing the material that comprised his Swahili diction-
ary, however, he was unable to find a publisher for many years. A copy of the 
manuscript of the dictionary was offered to UMCA for £100 in 1866, who dis-
cussed its purchase (UMCA/Home Executive Committee and Sub-Committee 
Book No. 2 1865–1899: 24). Four manuscript volumes of Krapf’s ‘Dictionary 
of the Suahili Language’ (1846–53) (USPG X 158–161) are held at the Bodleian 
Library, University of Oxford. The Swahili words are given in Roman script (as 
well as in Arabic script, for the first few entries in Volume 1 A–J), followed by a 
definition and an example of its use. Correspondence inside the front cover of 
Volume 1 from R.C. Bridges, University of Aberdeen and USPG, in 1969, shows 
that the society was unsure how the manuscript had come into their hands; 
Bridges suggests that it may have been the copy that Krapf had given to Thomas 
Wakefield of the United Methodist Free Churches. A letter from P.J.L. Frankl,

dated 21 January 1990, to the Archivist at Rhodes House Library also indicates 
uncertainty as to how the manuscript arrived with UMCA. The Minutes of the 
UMCA Executive Committee only make one reference to it being offered to 
them for sale and a decision being delayed until Bishop Tozer was present; he 
did attend meetings later in 1866 so it is possible that UMCA did purchase it.
The Suahili-English Dictionary was eventually published posthumously 
in 1882, by Trübner and Co. of London, Robert Cust (1821–1909) Honorary 
Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, and Member of the Committees of 
Church Missionary Society and British and Foreign Bible Societies writes in 
his Introduction:
While a few sheets remained in the press, the venerable compiler fell on 
his last sleep, leaving the great work of his holy and useful life incom-
pleted; on his table lay a corrected proof sheet, as some of his latest 
thoughts before his sudden call had been devoted to what he deemed an 
important factor in the great enterprise of converting the Pagan tribes 
of East Equatorial Africa, all of whom spoke this language, or kindred 
dialects.
The Committee were perfectly aware of a difference of opinion exist-
ing between two schools of scholars – that of Zanzibar, and that of 
Mombása. They were also perfectly aware that Dr. Krapf was the first in 
this linguistic field, was a scholar of high European repute; they laid stress 
upon the fact, that the Dictionary was his, and that of his lamented friend 
Dr. John Rebmann […]
There may be a difference of opinion on the mode of rendering the 
language into a modified form of the Roman Alphabet, and the mode of 
spelling
Cust in Krapf, 1882: v–vi
The dictionary became the basis for future dictionaries, notably that of 
A.C. Madan (1903) and Frederick Johnson’s revision of Madan’s dictionary 
(1939).
Krapf’s fellow CMS missionary, Johann Rebmann, also worked on translat-
ing parts of the Bible and gaining an understanding of Swahili Grammar. In 
1859 he reported as follows:
I have finished the translation of the Gospel of St. Luke into Kisuáheli, 
and have been most agreeably surprised to find how beautifully the word 
of God reads in that language also. I intend to send it to Bombay by April 
next, to have it printed, especially for the Africans in that place. For its

orthography, I have adopted the standard alphabet of Dr. Lepsius, as 
nearly as the Kisuáheli language admits it. As an appendix to the Gospel, 
I intend to print the elements of a spelling-book, for which two leaves will 
be sufficient, nothing being required but the alphabet, and a number of 
syllables. Every consonant (with but few exceptions) being followed by 
a vowel in this language, a quick boy will learn to read within a month’s 
time, as I have had several proofs among the Wanika, and also among the 
Suáhelis.
CMS Proceedings, 1859: 57
This report indicates something of Rebmann’s appreciation of writing and 
learning to read Swahili using the Roman alphabet. The different ways that 
the word Swahili is written in these reports to CMS give an indication as to the 
changes in transliteration: Sooahelee (1845), Suahéli (1851) Suáheli (1859) and 
Suahili (1882).
It seems that the early translators made an attempt to translate as accu-
rately as they could. In doing this, they faced several difficulties: Did they fully 
understand the language? Did their orthography correctly transliterate Arabic 
script to Roman script? How much freedom did they have in translating Holy 
Scripture? If ‘native’ speakers were prepared to help, did they understand what 
was to be expressed?
Edward Steere (1829–82), a UMCA missionary and third Bishop of Zanzibar, 
whilst acknowledging the work that Krapf had done, was sceptical as to the 
value of that work. Cedric Frank reports him as writing in an article for the 
Monthly Reporter (1882) published by BFBS:
All the Europeans told us that Krapf’s books were of no use at all, […] 
Not because he had misconceived the language but because he had been 
to some extent misled by a pedantic clique of so-called learned men in 
Mombasa, who induced him to accept as pure Swahili an over-refined 
kind of dialect, scarcely or not at all intelligible to the mass of the nation, 
and, further, because of a singularly confused style of writing and spell-
ing, so that the works were of scarcely any use to a mere beginner!
Frank, 1952: 38–9
Steere published A handbook of Swahili language as spoken at Zanzibar 
(1870) and began translating the Bible and many other works with the help of 
Zanzibaris (Topan 1992: 337). He also published Swahili Exercises (1878), which 
was then revised by A.B. Hellier and given ILC approval in 1933 as ‘the standard

grammar of the Swahili language, and as embodying the conclusions of the 
Committee itself’ and then republished many times (Steere and Hellier, 1952:i).
W.E. Taylor, writing in his Annual Letter in 1895, relates the difficulties of 
some of the people in Mombasa who helped him with translation:
Some able Mohammedan ‘lay’ men, whose orthodoxy is looked upon 
here as beyond suspicion, leaders in the scrupulous observance of their 
religious rites and ceremonies, have not only discussed with us the claims 
we press upon them with patience, but have even lent their abilities to 
us in the service of our translational work, and one, as a teacher of the 
language to some of our younger members […] an old blind man and 
very needy, but an accomplished scholar of Swahili and Arabic, always 
formerly refused to give an opinion on linguistic questions where religion 
was involved – often just where we needed criticism and guidance […] – 
because he feared he might be ‘selling his soul.’
Another, before giving me his free advice and help, asked me to satisfy 
him on the question, In what sense is Christ the Son of God? It being a 
Mohammedan misunderstanding of our doctrine to think that we teach 
God to stand in relations to Him Who is the Only-begotten Son, identi-
cal to those of earthly generation. Satisfying him that we held no such 
blasphemy, and endeavouring to state clearly the Mystery of the Eternal 
Generation, I was allowed to make critical use of my friend in the final 
touches to the Gospel of St. John, to which he has listened not only with-
out overt objection, but with great apparent interest, and has lent his 
considerable talents and linguistic acquirements to the better rendering 
of some of the more difficult passages.
CMS, Taylor AL, 1895: 584
CMS and UMCA had worked on Bible translations in the Swahili of the sphere 
they were working in, but, as Mission work spread inland, doubts arose as to 
its suitability. These Bible translations were in the ‘pure’ Swahili of the coast, 
which some missionaries considered to be too difficult for people of the bara 
(up-country) to understand. Farouk Topan discusses the approaches which 
Krapf and Rebmann in Mombasa, using Kimvita, and Steere in Zanzibar, using 
Kiunguja, used in Bible translation (Topan, 1992: 336–8).
For Steere, ʿKi-Mvita (as written by Krapf) rendered the (linguistic) works of 
Krapf and Rebmann ‘scarcely any use to a mere beginner’, while to Rebmann 
the Ki-Unguja was ‘low and vulgar’ (Topan, 1992: 338), a view also expressed by 
R.S. O’Fahey, who grew up in Mombasa, in a discussion in May 2003. Abdallah

Chapter 5
Khalid refers to Zanzibar Swahili as Arab Kijinga-jinga (Khalid, 1977: 120). 
Krapf’s attitude to Kiunguja appears to change later, as, in the Preface of his 
dictionary, published posthumously in 1882, he writes:
[L]atterly it occurred to me that the Zanzibar dialect was not without 
usefulness, as it is spoken by a very large number of people along the 
coast, and also affords for the translator the resource of being able to 
adopt at will an Arabic word when in difficulty for a proper expression 
in Kisuahili.
Krapf, 1882: xii
Arthur Madan (1846–1917), also a UMCA missionary, published a Swahili-English 
dictionary in 1903, which he described as ‘an annotated vocabulary of the 
dialect of Swahili commonly spoken in Zanzibar city. […] It is based on the 
lists of words […] furnished by Bishop Steere’s Handbook of Swahili […] and 
on Krapf’s Dictionary of Swahili […] Later sources have been drawn upon, 
especially Père Sacleux’s (Madan, 1903: iii). Charles Sacleux (1856–1943) was a 
French missionary of the Holy Ghost Fathers (HGF), who worked in Zanzibar 
and Bagamoyo (1879–98). He devoted much of his time to Swahili language 
study and became renowned as a lexicographer. Frankl notes that ‘Sacleux was 
fortunate to have studied Swahili before it was influenced by standardization 
and, later by English language patterns’ (Frankl, 2004a). Sacleux first produced 
his Dictionnaire francais-swahili in 1891 (Madan, 1903: iii); the final edition 
was published in 1939 and can be considered as the ‘definitive Swahili lexicon’ 
(Frankl, 2004a).

Scripture in Swahili
The role of missionary activity in the development of language and culture 
and the issue of translatability was addressed in Translating the Message: The 
Missionary Impact on Culture by Lamin Sanneh (1989). Sanneh primarily exam-
ines the ways Christian missionaries have influenced language and culture; 
however, the difference in approach between Christianity and Islam is also 
examined. He writes:
I suggest that by contrasting Christian mission with its Islamic coun-
terpart, we gain a fuller appreciation for their distinctive attitudes to 
translatability. Whereas for Christians, mission has come preeminently 
to mean translation, for Muslims mission has stood stubbornly for the 
nontranslatability of its Scriptures in the ritual obligations. Yet, in their

Swahili as a Religious Language
different ways, both religions have made tremendous gains as missionary 
faiths. The implications for cultural pluralism of such worldwide success 
by the two traditions are of abiding importance for everyone concerned. 
If we understand such contrasting themes in mission, it should prevent 
us from making facile or invidious comparisons. But more positively, it 
should enable interreligious exchange to take place on a more realistic 
basis, so that the issues raised in Islam’s universal faith-order may instruct 
Christians caught in the vernacular consequences of translatability, and, 
conversely, the Christian insights of vernacular self-understanding within 
the divine providence may encourage Muslims to show more interest in 
cultures and languages other than that mandated by the sacred Arabic. 
Such mutual instruction can only enhance the cause of peace and human 
solidarity and be a telling common witness to religious open-mindedness 
in a broken world.
Sanneh, 1989: 7–8
For East Africa, it is reasonable to question the premise that Islam has ‘stood 
stubbornly for nontranslatability’, since it was the realisation by al-Amin b. Aly 
Mazrui, in the 1930s, that Islam had to use Swahili as the medium of commu-
nication to inform and educate Muslims, that led him and Saleh al-Farsy to 
produce a Swahili version of the Qurʾān and to write tracts in Swahili.
The difficulties arising from translating any text from one language to 
another are acute. This becomes more significant when it is scripture that is 
translated. For both the Bible and the Qurʾān the versions available in Swahili 
have potential difficulties. For the Bible, most versions were translated by 
teams led by European missionaries who sometimes had difficulties with 
identifying equivalences and used words which might have been accurate at a 
basic level, but had a nuanced meaning different to that which the translator 
intended. For the Qurʾān, even translating it into Swahili leads to its veracity as 
the Qurʾān being questioned.
Muslims ascribe to Arabic the status of a revealed language, for it is the 
medium in which the Qurʾān, the sacred scripture of Islam, was revealed. 
In several passages the Qurʾān bears testimony to its own Arabic unique-
ness, what the authorities call its Iʿjāz, or ‘inimitable eloquence’ (see 
Qurʾān 10:38–39; 11:1–2, 16; 16:104–5; 28:49; 39:24, 29; 41:41–42; 43:1–3). The 
author of the Qurʾān, who is God, thus came to be associated with its 
speech, so that the very sounds of the language are believed to originate 
in heaven. Consequently, Muslims have instituted the sacred Arabic for 
the canonical devotions. Given the lay character of Islam, these canoni-
cal devotions have brought the sacred Arabic to the level of the ordinary

believer, although normally it is religious specialists who understand the 
language in any satisfactory fashion.
Sanneh, 1989: 212
Since Sanneh’s work, several Muslim writers have explored the issues of trans-
latability. Abdallah Saeed (2008) writes on translating the Qurʾān:
Given the large number of non-Arabic-speaking Muslims today (approx-
imately 80 per cent of all Muslims) the level of debate concerning the 
translation of the Qurʾān has increased. Muslim opinions vary widely on 
this issue, ranging from the extremely conservative view that translation 
of the Qurʾān is impossible or illegitimate to much more accommodating 
perspectives.
Muslims who argue that the Qurʾān cannot be translated provide a 
number of reasons for their viewpoint. For instance, a theological argu-
ment is that the Qurʾān is the Word of God and, hence, has a unique style 
that cannot be matched, even in Arabic. They argue that if a piece of writ-
ing like the Qurʾān cannot be imitated in Arabic, it follows that it can 
never be replicated in an entirely different language.
A linguistic argument is that translation from one language to another 
is always laden with difficulties. The meaning of a word in one language 
may not fully be conveyed in translation, resulting in the loss of part of 
the original meaning. This problem is amplified in the case of words 
whose meanings are associated with the cultural and linguistic context 
of a particular language and its community.
Saeed, 2008: 126
Hussein Abdul-Raof discusses in his Qur’an Translation: Discourse, Texture and 
Exegesis (2001) under the heading ‘Translation for accessibility of meaning’, 
the levels of equivalence that are attempted in translating: ‘A translator who 
aspires to achieve total lexical and/or textual equivalence is chasing a mirage: 
total equivalence at any level of language is impossible, relative equivalence at 
any level is possible’ (Abdul-Raof, 2001: 5–8).
This leaves the translator with a paradox: what level of equivalence should 
be attempted to achieve a valid translation, which both respects the original 
text and is comprehensible in the target language. ‘In each text there exist 
simultaneously three different but interrelated meanings: the ideational, inter-
personal, and textual meanings’ (Abdul-Raof, 2001: 14).
Fred Leemhuis (2006) sets out the circumstances in which it is permissible 
to attempt a translation:

Swahili as a Religious Language
The Qurʾān was thought to demonstrate and employ all the superior 
peculiarities of the Arabic language and thus it could not be rendered 
into another language […] An accurate rendering was thought to be 
impossible because it was believed that non-Arabic languages did not 
have at their disposal such extensive possibilities for the use of the figu-
rative language.
In the second place, the Arabic word for ‘translation’ (tarjama) appar-
ently meant a literal translation. If one were to make a literal translation 
of the Qurʾān, a translation that manifested all the subtleties of the origi-
nal Arabic text, then the miracle would be equalled. If a translation could 
be considered a kind of commentary, an ‘exegesis’ in another language 
that was not meant to replicate the original text, but was only to aid 
understanding, then it was permitted.
Leemhuis, 2006: 155
We have seen that qualified approval has been given for translating the Qurʾān; 
how can this then be approached? The search for relevant translation methods 
can be traced to the work of Eugene Nida (1914–2011), whose work on Dynamic 
Equivalence resulted in a revolution in translating the Bible from the 1960s 
onwards. His legacy has been reassessed by Philip Stine (2004). For translators 
Nida establishes a number of priorities:
–	 Contextual consistency takes priority over verbal consistency, so that a word 
in the source language may be rendered in several ways in different contexts;
–	 Functional equivalence takes priority over formal equivalence; the meaning 
is more important for the translator than the form itself;
–	 Oral language takes priority over written language. Punctuation or capitali-
zation, for example, cannot be used to disambiguate;
–	 The needs of the audience take priority over the actual forms of the lan-
guage, so that jargon and technical vocabulary are to be avoided. (Stine, 
2004: 132)
Christiane Nord examined the tensions between being faithful to the original 
text and making that text understandable for the target audience.
Translations considered ‘faithful’ in the intertextual sense often risk 
betraying the communicative intentions of the author.
My approach to translation thus stands on two pillars: functionalism 
(i.e. the aim of making the target text work for target-culture receivers) 
and loyalty (i.e. taking into account the intentions and expectations of 
all the partners in the interaction named translation). To ‘take account’ 
does not imply ‘doing what the others expect you to do’. It means that

translators have to consider the subjective theories of their partners and 
explain their translational purposes and methods if they behave in a way 
that may be contradictory to these theories.
Nord, 2001: 185–6, 195–6
Saeed gives three possible approaches that can be taken by a translator:
Some translators attempt to convey the meaning of the Qurʾān as they 
understand it. Although they may perceive themselves to be objective, 
their choice of words will still be influenced by their worldview. For 
instance, many traditionalist translators may not be particularly con-
cerned with issues of gender equality, and often provide interpreta-
tions of the text that emphasize patriarchal understandings and gender 
inequality.
In contrast, some translators attempt to remain aware of the influ-
ence their views may have by providing a translation that is as literal 
as possible, expressing their own understanding of the text in separate 
commentaries. Although their final choice of words will, to some extent, 
be influenced by their own understandings, these translators tend to be 
more conscious of this.
The third approach of some translators is to include phrases and 
words in the translation that reflect their own opinions but may have 
very little connection with the text’s actual meaning. This is perhaps best 
described as claiming to translate the text, but actually providing a trans-
lation which includes a commentary in the body of the translation itself.
Saeed, 2008: 129
Having reviewed various possible approaches to translating scripture that have 
been used, we now turn to examine versions of the Bible and the Qurʾān in 
Swahili.
4.1	
The Bible in Swahili
The Bible has been translated into Swahili several times. The first transla-
tion of any part of the Bible into Swahili that was published was of Genesis 
Chapters 1–3, in 1847, translated by J.L. Krapf and assisted by Ali bin Mohedin, 
who was the qāḍī (Judge, Swahili Kadhi) in Mombasa (Kalugila, 1997:11; 
Waruta, 1975: 22). The complete New Testament was first published in 1883, 
with revisions in 1892, by the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), in 
Kiswahili cha Kiunguja (Zanzibar Swahili); this was mainly the work of Bishop 
Edward Steere. The Swahili translations of the Gospels of John and Matthew

were transliterated into Arabic script and published in 1888 and 1891 (Mojola, 
1999: 67). Arthur Madan (1846–1917), together with Percy Bateman and assisted 
by Petro Limo and Cecil Majaliwa, further revised it in the light of the new 
English Revised Version (RV) which was published in 1885 and a new edition 
was published in 1893, printed at the Zanzibar Mission Press (Mojola, 1999: 67; 
Kalugila, 1997: 18). The Old Testament in Zanzibar Swahili was published in 
1895, leading to the first complete Bible in swahili (Bedford, 1954: 58). This was 
revised several times with the last set of corrections being in 1923; it was then 
reprinted several times until 1947 (Peltola, 1957: 23–4).
The New Testament in Kiswahili cha Kimvita (Mombasa Swahili) was pub-
lished in 1909 and the Old Testament in 1914, the main translation task having 
been done by H.K. Binns and W.E. Taylor, who were both CMS Missionaries 
(Mojola, 1999: 5). See Figure 5.1.
It was considered by Karl Roehl that the Swahili used in these versions was 
too heavily dependent on Arabic and seen as too Islamic (Roehl, 1930: 197). 
Karl Roehl (1870–1951) of the Bethel Mission, a German Lutheran, argued that

Chapter 5
‘the publication of a Swahili Bible with fewer Arabic loan-words than the pres-
ent one seems a necessity for the people of the hinterland’ (Roehl, 1930: 200). 
Roehl’s New Testament was a revision of a translation by Martin Klamroth 
(Berlin Mission), which, because of the outbreak of the First World War, had 
never been published. Roehl was assisted in his translation by Martin Nganisya 
and Andrea Ndekeja (Mojola, 1999: 69). Osotsi Mojola writes that Roehl aimed 
at fully utilising Kiunguja, whilst ‘capturing its expanded use and function in 
the interior’ (Mojola, 1999: 68). Broomfield was critical of Roehl’s approach, 
and queried whether Swahili really was a Bantu language that needed to be 
‘purified’ of Arabic loan-words, which he understood to be Roehl’s position 
(Broomfield, 1931: 78–9). He commented that when there was a need to cre-
ate new words when translating, it was easier to ‘Bantuize’ Arabic words than 
English words (Broomfield, 1930: 521). In 1937 the Württemburg Bible Society 
published Roehl’s Bible Translation Biblia ndio Maandiko Matakatifu yote ya 
Agano la Kale nayo ya Agano Jipya katika Msemo ya Kiswahili (The Bible, that 
is all the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament and the New Testament in the 
Swahili speech). See Figure 5.2.
Bedford describes it as ‘Bantuized’ Swahili and notes that it contained prints 
of Bible scenes and as such was the first illustrated Bible in East Africa (1954: 
60). It was published again in 1961, in 1995 and again in 2004, when 2,000 
additional copies were printed (Mojola, 1999: 72; Mtingele, 2007, personal

communication). Topan has written informatively about these earlier trans-
lations and the disagreements between Roehl and Broomfield (1992: 338–42).
Missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church carried out some translation 
work. Emile Brutel, of the Missionaries of Africa (White Fathers – WF), had his 
translation of the four Gospels and Acts using Kiswahili cha Kiunguja published 
in 1923 (Bühlmann, 1950: xii) in Algiers, the Mother House of the Order, but it 
did not achieve a wide circulation. Charles Sacleux, of the Holy Ghost Fathers 
(HGF), published selections of both the Old Testament and New Testament, 
Hadisi ya Dini (Religious Stories) which was published in Bagamoyo (3rd 
edition 1925); his complete New Testament was published in Grasse in 1937 
(Mojola, 1999: 68).
This meant that, in addition to the Catholic New Testaments, three different 
translations of the whole Bible were available in Swahili, which led to confu-
sion and disagreement over the understanding and interpretation of the Bible. 
Examples of this confusion will be seen in the tracts examined below.
In 1942, a decision was made by the British and Foreign Bible Society 
(BFBS), to produce a unified translation rather than rely on either Kimvita or 
Kiunguja Swahili (Bedford, 1954: 22). The committee of translators was led by 
Canon H.J. Butcher of the CMS and Canon A.B. Hellier of the UMCA. These 
two represented not only two different traditions of churchmanship within 
Anglicanism, but also the use of the Swahili of Mombasa and Zanzibar. Mojola 
recounts some of the disagreements between the two groups, ostensibly on lin-
guistic ability (1999: 71), but in effect they were a reflection of the two extremes 
of Anglican churchmanship that they represented. The complete Maandiko 
Matakatifu ya Mungu Yaitwayo Biblia yaani Agano la Kale Na Agano Jipya 
Katika Lugha ya Kiswahili (The Holy Scriptures of God called the Bible, that is 
the Old Testament and the New Testament in the Language of Swahili) transla-
tion was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1952. See Figure 
5.3. The approach to translation is very similar to that of the English Revised 
Standard Version, also published in 1952, the method of translation being neno 
kwa neno (word for word) (BHN, 1977: Preface), that is, a literal translation. This 
version is commonly called the Union Version. Inside the cover of the 1994 edi-
tion it says in English, ‘The Holy Bible in Kiswahili Union Version Published as 
Maandiko Matakatifu’. The 1952 edition says ‘The Holy Bible in Swahili Union 
Version’. It is the most widely used Swahili Bible and has been made available 
at greatly discounted prices. In 1989 it sold for Tanzanian Shillings 200/=, in 
1997 it sold for Tanzania Shillings 500/=, in 2007 it sold for 5,500/=. The value of 
the Tanzanian Shilling fell in this period: in 1989, 200/= was equivalent to One 
pound Sterling; in 1998, 500/= was equivalent to 50 pence Sterling; in 2007,

5,500/= was equivalent to Two pounds Sterling; in 2022, 25,000/= was equiva-
lent to around Eight pounds Sterling.
The 1997 edition, Biblia yenye Itifaki, included a concordance. In 1998 the 
then General Secretary of the Tanzanian Bible Society, Rev Albert Mongi, 
based in Dodoma, reported that it cost around Five Pounds Sterling to print 
and import a Bible, the selling price only covering costs within Tanzania. The 
‘real’ cost of the Bibles is covered by donations from supporters of the various 
national Bible Societies around the world, working together under the United 
Bible Societies (UBS).
In 1950, in an article on the early history of the RTS, Gordon Hewitt wrote of 
the need to critically re-assess the earlier translations of the Bible:
To-day, when the planning of literature has taken on a new importance in 
missionary strategy, it is proper that the convictions which governed the

Swahili as a Religious Language
work of an earlier generation should be critically examined. Translation 
is now seen to be a much more difficult and complicated matter than it 
appeared to be a hundred and fifty years ago. Much of the work of the 
earlier translators of the Bible requires to be done again, and the ear-
lier accumulations of popular Christian literature are properly regarded 
unsuitable for reprinting. Further, the rapid growth of adult literacy has 
created a demand for a new type of literature which as yet hardly exists. 
Those wrestling with the problems of retranslating the Bible, or coping 
with the aftermath of a literacy campaign, may be excused for some 
impatience, and indeed exasperation, at the curiously amateur way in 
which the older literature was apparently produced.
Hewitt, 1950: 92
The fact that this was realised at this point is good, but the challenge went 
largely unheeded for a time.
In 1963, J.W.T. Allen criticised the existing translations as being by those 
who had European languages as a first language, who can never know Swahili 
well enough to give a translation that ‘deceives the reader that it is his native 
language’. He also criticised the use of limited vocabulary in translations of 
the Bible. He argued for the need for a Bible translated by Swahili speaking 
Christians who can learn Greek and Hebrew and who are not afraid of using 
difficult words and technical terms (Allen, 1963: 126). The reason for this can 
be seen in the history of Bible Translation in East Africa. It was usually car-
ried out by expatriate missionaries, with, up to that time, very little input from 
people with Swahili as their first language. Finally, Allen states what he sees as 
the value of having ‘a single authoritative version […] usable throughout the 
Swahili world […] it would have a unifying effect […] at the same time doing 
something to undermine the feeling that Christianity is foreign’ (1963: 127).
Allen’s plea was partially addressed in 1972, when the Bible Societies 
decided that a modern language Swahili Bible was needed and began work on 
Biblia Habari Njema (The Good News Bible). The New Testament and Psalms 
were published in 1977; however, the complete Bible, including Apocrypha, 
was not published until 1995 (BHN, 1995: Preface). See Figure 5.4. The team 
of translators were all East Africans, and inter-confessional; they included 
Peter Renju, Cosmas Haule, Jared Mwanjalla, David Mhina, Amon Mahava, 
Ammon Oendo, Douglas Waruta, and Leonidas Kalugila (Mojola, 1999: 9). 
This translation uses the maana kwa maana (meaning for meaning) approach 
and is similar in style to the English Good News Bible. It can be regarded as 
a translation using functional equivalence, which is more readily accessible 
to the ordinary reader. Ernst-August Gutt explains that equivalence is ‘the

dominant evaluative concept in translation […] “equivalence”: the quality of 
translated text is assessed in terms of its equivalence to the original text’ (1991: 
10). However, this version of the Bible has taken time to gain wide acceptance, 
due, in part, to the differences in language, and readers’ reluctance to change 
from the Union Version.
Two further Catholic translations of the New Testament appeared, using 
standard Swahili. One, published in Morogoro in 1958, was by Alfons Loogman 
(WF), who had previously published the Gospel of Matthew (Mombasa, 1936) 
and the Gospel of John (Bagamoyo, 1938) (Bühlmann, 1950: xii). The second 
was by Alkuin Bundschur, and published in Ndanda in 1985; neither achieved 
a wide circulation and so have had a limited impact (Kalugila, 1997: 32; Mojola, 
1999: 73).
In 1963, Mathias Mnyampala produced a poetic version of the gospels, Utenzi 
wa Enjili Takatifu (Poem of the Holy Gospels) which was originally published 
by the Swahili Committee for East Africa, as a supplement to their Journal. 
Noss and Renju report that in his Introduction Mnyampala assures:
[T]he reader that he uses the very same words that are found in the four 
Gospels, he affirms that he has also changed them into poetry by short-
ening and lengthening as necessary to create the measures and rhyme 
of the stanzas. His rendering is not a translation but a retelling of the 
essence of the Gospel story.

Swahili as a Religious Language
Utenzi wa Enjili Takatifu relates the story of Jesus, from his birth to his death, 
resurrection and ascension in 1,215 four-line rhyming verses. Noss and Renju 
describe Mnyampala’s work as being in the ‘classic’ form of utenzi, using quat-
rains with ‘the first three lines having a vocalic rhyme in the last syllable of the 
last word of each line, while the fourth line carries a […] rhyme with all stanza 
final lines throughout the poem’ (Noss and Renju, 2004: 34). An illustrated edi-
tion was subsequently published in Ndanda in 1967.
In 1967, a Catholic edition of the Union Version was produced, in two vol-
umes; this incorporated a Swahili translation of the Introduction to each book 
together with footnotes from the Jerusalem Bible, as well the Deuterocanonical 
Books. This was published by Tabora Mission Press, Kipalapala, Tabora (Tanner, 
1978: 123).
The Deuterocanonical Books are also known as the Apocrypha: these are 
books which are not included in the Hebrew Bible, but are included in the 
Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Old Testament which dates from 
the second century BC. They are also in the Latin Vulgate Bible, and the Roman 
Catholic Church regards them as canonical. Protestant churches regard them 
as extra-canonical, but worthy of study.
Living Bibles International, now called Biblica, published Biblia ya Uzima 
(Living Bible) in 1984. A fully revised edition, renamed Neno: Agano Jipya (The 
Word: New Testament), was published in 1989, because the first edition was 
found to have many serious errors and shortcomings (Mojola, 1999: 9). One 
edition, published in 1996, has parallel Swahili and Arabic texts. For many 
years it appeared as if only the New Testament was to be published, however, 
in 2006 an on-line version of Neno: Biblia Takatifu was published, including the 
Old Testament; a print version was made available in 2009. This translation fol-
lows the ethos of the English New International Version of the Bible and could 
be regarded as being a paraphrase using functional equivalence.
In 1996, Julius Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania, published poetic 
versions of the Four Gospels and the Book of Acts in Swahili. They appeared 
as separate volumes with a preface by the Archbishop of Dar es Salaam and 
were published by Benedictine Publications, Ndanda. The volumes are Utenzi 
wa Enjili: Kadiri ya Utongo wa Matayo (Poem of the Gospel: The deeds of God 
Almighty by Matthew); Utenzi wa Enjili: Kadiri ya Utongo wa Marko; Utenzi wa 
Enjili: Kadiri ya Utongo wa Luka; Utenzi wa Enjili: Kadiri ya Utongo wa Yohana; 
Utenzi wa Matendo ya Mitume, all published in 1996 (Noss and Renju, 2004: 
22, 33). The intention was to publish the whole of the New Testament in this 
form, but following Nyerere’s death in 1999 this did not happen. Philip Noss 
and Peter Renju have written about them and the use of the Tenzi (Poetic) form 
(Noss and Renju, 2004: 19–34; 2007: 41–50).

The UBS undertook an extensive consultation concerning the Union Version. 
This included corrections and changing some words that are considered 
archaic, or have changed their meaning. It was published as the Revised Union 
Version (RUV) in 2006. The preface of the new edition states:
Suala la kuwa na Toleo Jipya la Biblia ya SUV limetokana na ukweli 
kwamba Biblia hiyo ina maneno kadhaa ambayo hayatumiki tena. Zaidi 
ya hayo nayo matumizi ya kisarufi pengine sisawa.
The question of a New Edition of the SUV [Swahili Union Version] comes 
about because of the truth that this Bible has a number of words that 
are not now used. In addition to this the use of grammar is not always 
correct.
RUV, 2006: vii
The text is presented in two columns, with an Introduction to each book and 
footnotes giving cross references to other biblical passages and some alterna-
tive readings. A comparison of the text of the passages of scripture examined, 
in the RUV and the Union Version, found only fifteen differences in the ten 
passages, a total of forty-one verses. They consist of changes of spelling, e.g. 
wanaume for waume (humanity) (Acts 2:22); use of a different word, giving the 
same meaning, e.g. atamtuma (he will send him) Instead of atampeleka (he 
will send/take him) (John 14:26); some additional words to clarify a phrase, e.g. 
kizazi cha (generation of) is added in Jude 1:14, inserted between mtuwa and 
saba baada ya Adamu (the seventh person after Adam); changes in capitali-
sation, e.g. Romans 3:21 UV has torati na manabii whereas RUV has Torati na 
Manabii. Changing the order of a phrase, e.g. Matthew 15:23. The RUV reads: 
Kwa kuwa anaendelea kutupigia makelele (Because she continues to shout 
loudly at us), whilst the UV reads: kwa maana anapiga kelele (because she 
is making a noise). None of the passages examined in part two have changes.
See Appendix 1 for examples of Bible passages in Swahili from the different 
versions discussed.

The Qurʾān in Swahili
The use of a translation of the Qurʾān in any language has been viewed with 
suspicion by the ʿUlamāʾ. This was the case in East Africa, with the religious 
teachers of Lamu, Mombasa and Zanzibar being deeply mistrustful of any 
attempts to produce a Swahili translation. Because of this, when the Qurʾān 
appears in Swahili, or any language other than Arabic, it is referred to as pre-
senting the ‘meaning’ of the Qurʾān, and not as a translation. Five complete 
versions of the Qurʾān are available in Swahili.

Swahili as a Religious Language
The first version, by a missionary of the Universities’ Mission to Central 
Africa (UMCA), Godfrey Dale (1861–1941), was published in 1923. Dale served 
with UMCA from 1889–1897 when he retired. He then rejoined from 1902–22. 
In addition to his translation of the Qurʾān, he was also the author of several 
books on Islam (Blood, 1957: 87, 167; 1962: 87, 203, 403). He titled the version 
of the Qurʾān: Tafsiri ya Kurani ya Kiarabu kwa lugha ya Kiswahili pamojaa na 
Dibaji na maelezo Machache (Translation of the Arabic Qurʾān into the Swahili 
language together with a Preface and a few brief explanations). See Figure 5.5. 
Each sūra begins with the name and the total number of verses. The text itself 
was not versified, nor did it have an Arabic parallel text. Dale explained, in an 
article in the Moslem World, written at the time of publication that:
In East Africa there is a stereotyped edition of the Arabic Koran, very 
cheap; and it is this edition which has the largest circulation. This has 
been taken as a standard text, and the Swahili translation corresponds 
with it, page with page. The number of each page in the translation cor-
responds with the original.
Dale, 1924: 9
In the same article, Dale also went on to explain his hoped for outcomes of 
producing the Qurʾān:
1)	
Everything that is made manifest is light. If it is good, it is seen to be 
good; if evil it is seen to be evil, by the general moral sense of mankind, 
especially when that moral sense is under the guidance and control of 
the Spirit of God. There can be no satisfactory conclusion reached when 
much of the evidence required is hidden from view.
2)	
Ignorance will be proved to be ignorance, and inaccuracy will be proved 
to be inaccuracy.
3)	
The general African public will no longer be able to say, ‘If these Christians 
could read the Koran they might not remain Christian.’
4)	
The general African public will know what the Koran actually does teach 
on such subjects as slavery, polygamy, divorce; and will compare it with 
Christian teachings. And as Christian teaching has largely prevailed on 
these subjects in the past, why should we doubt whether it will prevail 
in the future?
5)	
Modern Islam in Africa is very largely unhistorical, especially on the sub-
ject of Mohammed’s infancy, later conversion, miraculous power and sin-
lessness. We shall be very much surprised if our teachers do not make full 
use of all the passages in the Koran which run counter to the extravagant 
belief of a later idealism with regard to Mohammed (Dale, 1924: 8).

Chapter 5
Because Dale was not a Muslim, these reasons for producing a version of the 
Qurʾān in Swahili were viewed with suspicion. His ability to understand Arabic 
and his style of writing in Swahili were questioned.
Anne Bang regards Dale’s purpose in producing a Swahili version of the 
Qurʾān as being:
[T]o provide a tool for the missionaries active in Zanzibar. He was also 
of the view that a vernacular version of the Quran would be beneficial 
to the Muslim population, whose religious education chiefly consisted 
of ‘parrot-like’ memorisation of the Arabic text. […] Unsurprisingly, his 
work did not make it into either the government schools or the Quranic 
schools. It was, however, used in the mission schools.
Bang, 2003: 176–7

Swahili as a Religious Language
The Swahili of the text does not follow the spelling of standard Swahili, as it 
was published before the setting up of the Inter-territorial Language (Swahili) 
Committee for the East Africa Dependencies (ILC). The meaning of the text 
is clear and understandable, however the 140 pages of maelezo (comments), 
which appear as endnotes ‘reveal a biased turn of mind’ (Frankl, 1998: 192) and 
tend to be polemical.
R.S. O’Fahey states that ‘Three years after Dale’s translation there was pub-
lished in Zanzibar an “authorized” colonial translation of selected chapters of 
the Qurʾān’ (2000: 17). O’Fahey also writes about the development of Swahili 
literature in this paper; see also his articles on ‘Arabic Literature in the Eastern 
Half of Africa’ (2005a) and ‘The Study of Swahili’ (2005b). This was part of an 
initiative to upgrade education on Zanzibar. The Education Department of the 
Protectorate of Zanzibar had been concerned as to how African Muslim pupils 
were to gain sufficient understanding of their faith, including the Qurʾān. It 
was noted ‘that no textbooks were available in Swahili for the explanation 
of Qurʾānic texts and Islamic practice and theology’ (Bang, 2003: 179). The 
Department of Education’s Annual Report for 1926 relates what eventuated:
‘Aya zilizochaguliwa katika Kuraani Takatifu’ and ‘Risalat al Jamia’. The 
first of these books was printed in the Government Press, Zanzibar, in 
1926, and there are some 6,000 copies in stock which are available for sale 
to other territories at three annas per copy.
	
The second is now ready for the press.
These books produced as the result of a meeting of the Kadhis of 
Zanzibar held to discuss the teaching of Muḥammadan religion in our 
district schools.
In the former, passages from the Kuran are given and explained, while 
in the second the principles and religious duties are expounded in detail.
The original text was contributed by the late Sheikh Ahmed bin Abi 
Bakr bin Sumeit el-Alawi, the chief Kadhi, in Arabic; and the Swahili 
translation has been prepared in collaboration by Kadhi Sheikh Taher 
bin Abi Bakr el-Amawi and members of this department.
The Arabic text is printed on the right and the Swahili text on the left 
of each page.
The books are pronounced by the Kadhis as being sufficient in them-
selves for all the Kuran teaching required in elementary schools where 
the pupils are African Muslims. The Arabic language is of no use to such 
pupils except for the teaching of their religion. These books reduce the 
use of Arabic for this purpose to a minimum.

Chapter 5
Anne Bang explains that a committee was formed, including Aḥmad b. Abī 
Bakr b. Sumayṭ (1861–1925), Ṭāhir b. Abī Bakr al-Amawī (1877–1938) and 
William Harold Ingrams (1897–1973). Sumayṭ selected the passages for use 
and provided the initial Swahili translation, Ṭāhir and Ingrams then read the 
proofs (Bang, 2003: 178–80). In 1926 the Education Department published Aya 
zilizochaguliwa katika Kuraani takatifu Kwa Sababu ya Kutumiwa Katika Vyuo 
Vya Unguja (Selected Verses from the Holy Qurʾān for the use in the schools of 
Zanzibar), as a booklet of around twenty pages. This was followed by Risalat 
al-Jamia (Treatise on Various Subjects).
By 1927 both Aya Zilizochaguliwa and Risalat were in use in government dis-
trict schools; their reception was mixed, with protests from Pemba and else-
where as it was perceived as being an attack on Arabic, especially with the 
introduction of Latin script for Swahili (Bang, 2003: 181).
The second complete version, Kurani Tukufu (The Glorious Qurʾān), by 
Mubarak Aḥmad Aḥmadi, an Indian, using Standard Swahili, was published by 
the Aḥmadiyya in 1953. See Figure 5.6.

Swahili as a Religious Language
This is versified counting the Basmala as the first verse, with a parallel Arabic 
text. Each sūra begins with the title in transliterated Arabic, information as to 
where it was revealed, either Mecca or Medina, the number of ayā (verses) and 
how many pauses in recitation there are. Mafungu (portions) is used here for 
the Arabic waqf. Footnotes give brief explanatory notes, often defending the 
Aḥmadi interpretation of the ayā. Thirty thousand copies have been printed in 
the first four editions up to the one printed in 1991 in Dar es Salaam. A revised 
edition was published in 2008. This version was received with great suspicion 
and was regarded as propagating the ideas of the Aḥmadiyya.
In 1954, al-Farsy published a pamphlet, Marejezo ya Upotofu wa Tafsiri ya 
Makadiani ya Khataman Nabiyyin (Corrections of the Perverse Qadianiyya 
Translation of the Seal of the Prophets), attacking the translation (Lacunza 
Balda, 1997: 110, 124).
When the Aḥmadiyya announced the project, both al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui 
(1891–1949) and Abdalla Saleh al-Farsy (1912–82) began to produce their own 
versions, publishing them as individual juzuu (Swahili, Section of the Qurʾān, 
one-thirtieth, Arabic juzʾ). Mazrui only completed a few juzuu before he died. 
Al-Amin b. Aly Mazrui produced a version of Juzuu Amma ( juzʾʿĀmma) for 
the young pupils of al-Ghazali Muslim School, Mombasa in the early 1930s; 
this is still published by Adam Traders. In 1936 he began work on Al-Fātiḥa 
and Al-Baqara, which were published in Lahore in 1940 and subsequently in 
Nairobi in 1980. Kasim Mazrui took over the project and Āl ʿImrān and Al-Nisāʾ 
were published in 1981 (Frankl, 1998: 192). Each sūra begins with the title in 
transliterated Arabic, with a Swahili explanation, then where it was revealed 
and the total number of verses.
In Zanzibar, Abdalla Saleh al-Farsy began producing his own version, which 
was based on his broadcast Friday sermons and as such should be consid-
ered as a ‘free version’ of the original (Topan, 2007, discussion). This view is 
supported by his student Saidi Musa in his brief biography of al Farsy. Musa 
reports that from 1939 al Farsy had a radio programme, Mawaidha (Counsel), 
which was broadcast each Monday, Thursday and Saturday evening at 6.15 pm. 
The broadcasts would have included readings from his rendition of the Qurʾān 
(Musa, 1986: 59).
Sections of the Qurani Takatifu were then initially published in Mwongozi, 
a Zanzibari weekly newspaper during the 1950s (Glassman, 2000: 422). By 
1960 the first twelve juzʾ were published as Tafsiri ya Kurani. Juzuu ya awali. 
Albaqarah (Interpretation of the Qurʾān, the early juzʾ. Albaqarah) (Kiplagat 
and von Sicard, 1960: 32).
J.S. Trimingham, writing in 1964, reported on this early edition of Al-Farsy’s 
work:

Chapter 5
This translation has been appearing in parts since 1956 and about 
twelve out of thirty parts have so far been published. The Swahili ver-
sion, in parallel columns with the Arabic text, is called Tafsiri ya Kurani, 
‘Commentary (= paraphrase) on the Qurʾān’, since the Qurʾān cannot 
be translated. Its production compares unfavourably with that of the 
Aḥmadīs and it is surprisingly little known outside Zanzibar, since the 
shaikhs do not encourage its circulation in order to preserve their own 
distinction as masters of holy writ. Many Muslims, apologetic about the 
use of the Aḥmadī version, were quite unaware that an orthodox one 
existed, and very rarely could it be found among the book stocks in the 
shops.
Trimingham, 1964: 110–11, fn. 1
This report is informative about the attitude of the ʿUlamāʾ and the limited 
awareness of the work, prior to the complete Qurani Takatifu (The Holy 
Qurʾān) being published in 1969 by the Islamic Foundation in Nairobi, as a 
single volume. See Figure 5.7. This is versified with Arabic parallel text and 
extensive footnotes. Each sūra begins with the title in transliterated Arabic, 
where it was revealed, the number of ayā and the number of stops in the rec-
itation, Makara (pause in reading to allow another to take up the reading). 
The footnotes consist largely of responses to the Makadiyani (Qadiani), that is, 
Aḥmadi’s version of the Qurʾān, rather than any response to the Dale version. 
Subsequent editions have included Msingi wa Kufahamu Qurani (Foundation 
of Understanding the Qurʾān) by Abuʾl-Aʿla-Maudūdī, and his Introduction to 
each sūra was included in the 1997 edition. It has been published in eight edi-
tions with a total of 123,000 copies being printed. Another version is available, 
which includes a third parallel column with transliterated Arabic. It does not 
include the introductory material found in other editions. This edition does 
not appear to have been published by the Islamic Foundation and no publish-
ing details are given.
Abdalla al-Farsy, a Zanzibari who had worked as a teacher and government 
official before Independence, continued to work for the new government in 
Zanzibar after the revolution in 1964, but eventually left in 1967, when the 
general political situation became desperate (Loimeier, 2003: 251). When he 
moved to Kenya, he was nominated as Chief Kadhi of Kenya, a post he held 
for 14 years. Kadhi is the Swahili for qāḍī. Kadhi is the official form used in 
the Kenyan legal system and constitution. His being chosen as Chief Kadhi 
led to the Kenyan scholars feeling that they had been overlooked and an ‘out-
sider’ had been imposed on them. This may have been one of the factors for 
their attacks on his version of the Qurʾān (Loimeier, 2003: 251). In 1970, Ahmed

Ahmed Badawiy, one of the scholars from Lamu, collected the views of a num-
ber of Kenyan scholars from the coast in Fimbo ya Musa: Maonyesho ya Tafsiri 
Mpya ya Sheikh A.S. Al-Farsy (The Rod of Moses: An exposé of the new inter-
pretation by Sheikh A.S. Al-Farsy), which was a detailed critique and attack 
on al-Farsy for his Swahili version of the Qurʾān. Lacunza Balda describes the 
reasons for these attacks as being a result of al-Farsy having refused to meet 
with the scholars to discuss his translation; also that they were concerned at 
the loss of ‘authority’ once the Qurʾān became accessible to all (Lacunza Balda, 
1997: 113–14). The ʿUlamāʾ of Riyadha Mosque, Lamu, founded in 1889 by Salih 
b. Alawi Jamalil-Lail (1844–1935), originally from a sharīf family in Comoros 
(Kresse, 2007: 87), had long considered themselves as having greater authority 
than the ʿUlamāʾ of Zanzibar and Mombasa.
James Holway, writing in 1971, comments on the reception of al-Farsy’s 
translation:
Appearing as it does after 16 years of controversy between Aḥmadīya mis-
sionaries and Sunni teachers, it is not surprising that there are a number

of references in the commentary to the Waahmadiyya or Makadiani. On 
the other hand, references to Dale, and indeed to Christianity, are scanty. 
Insofar as the commentary is polemical, it would appear to defend the 
orthodox position against heretics rather than defend the superiority of 
Islam over Christianity.
Holway, 1971: 104
In addition to James Holway (1971), Justo Lacunza Balda (1993 and 1997) and 
Hassan Ma‌ʾayergi (1994) have also written about the first three versions of the 
Qurʾān in Swahili.
Imtiyaz Yusuf regards Qurani Takatifu as ‘reflecting the influences of Islamic 
Modernists Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–98) and Muhammad Abduh’. Yusuf 
also comments that it ‘is a polemical retort to the Swahili translation of the 
Qurʾān by the Qadianis [Aḥmadi]’; furthermore he links this anti-Qadiani 
stance with the support given to al-Farsy by the Islamic Foundation and 
Abuʾl-Aʿla-Maudūdī (1992: 351).
In 1995, Sheikh Ali Muhsin al-Barwani (1919–2006) published Tarjama ya 
Al-Muntakhab katika tafsiri ya Qur’ani tukufu (An interpretation of selected 
passages being an exegesis of the Holy Qurʾān) in two volumes, versified with 
Arabic parallel text. See Figure 5.8. Each sūra begins with the title in transliter-
ated Arabic, where it was revealed and then a detailed introduction. P.J.L. Frankl, 
in a review of al-Barwani’s Qurʾān, explains the meaning of al-Muntakhab as ‘a 
selection from various Qurʾānic commentaries, compiled by a team of scholars 
of the Holy Qurʾān of al-Azhar in Cairo’; it is this that al-Barwani has translated 
into Swahili (Frankl, 1998: 192).
Al-Barwani is a Zanzibari, born in 1919. He studied at King’s College, 
Makerere, Uganda from 1937–42, when it was the only University in East Africa. 
He worked as an assistant Agricultural Officer at Mangwapani and subse-
quently edited an independent newspaper on Zanzibar, Mwongozi (Guide). He 
was a leader of the Zanzibar National Party (ZNP) at the time of Independence 
in December 1963. The revolution in January 1964 ousted the ZNP which was 
seen as being closely identified with the Sulṭān, thus seen as ‘pro-Arab’ and 
‘anti-African’, and brought the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) into power. It was 
under these circumstances that al-Barwani was imprisoned in 1964. He was 
released in 1974, and on being refused a Tanzanian passport, he escaped to 
Kenya, claiming refugee status, and eventually settled in Dubai (Frankl, 2006; 
Glassman, 2000: 419, 422).
A second edition of the Qurʾān was published as a single volume in 2000. In 
the Preface, al-Barwani explains why he has produced his translation:

drawn to write in Swahili, so that my fellow Swahili people who do not 
know Arabic are able to understand and receive guidance, just as I have 
been guided. […] well I can see a great inheritance for those readers 
of Swahili who have already tasted the sweetness of the Qurʾān in the 
translations of Sheikh Al-amin bin Aly Mazrui and Sheikh Abdulla Saleh 
Al-Farsy or for those who have heard the translation of Jalalayn read in 
the Mosque.
al-Barwani, 2000: vii
Jalalayn refers to: Tafsīr al-Jalālayn: ‘Commentary of the two Jalāls,’ Jalāl 
ad-dīn al-Suyūti’s (d. 1505) completion of the tafsīr of his teacher, Jalāl ad-dīn 
al-Mahallī (d. 1459) (Bewley, 1998: 93).
In a review, Frankl comments that al-Barwani ‘has deliberately eschewed 
the standardized language for his translation […] and turned rather to the 
language of his parents [Zanzibar Swahili]. As a consequence, he has given to 
the Swahili-speaking world both a translation and a work of art’ (Frankl, 1998: 
192–3).
The complete text of al-Barwani’s version is readily available through the 
internet, with links to it from many sites. P.J.L. Frankl and Yahya Ali Omar, 1999: 
109–14, make reference to al-Barwani’s version in their discussion on the origin 
of the Swahili word for Holy takatifu.
Another Swahili version of the Qurʾān is Quran Tukufu (The Glorious 
Qurʾān) by Sheikh Ali bin Juma bin Mayunga of Dar es Salaam.2 It is versi-
fied with Arabic parallel text. Each sūra begins with the title in transliterated 
Arabic, where it was revealed and the number of ayā.
This version is of interest in that it is prepared from a Shiʾa perspective; 
the Introduction was written by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi (died 2002), 
the Chairman of Ahluʾl-Bayt Assembly of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, dated 
June 2002. In 1968 Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi helped found the Bilal Muslim 
Mission of Tanzania, based in Dar es Salaam, which he directed for many years.
Other people have produced Swahili versions of some of the juzuu. These 
include Saidi Musa (b. 1944) who, according to Justo Lacunza Balda (1997), has 
been working on a new version and commentary of the Qurʾān (1997: 116).
In 2000, Machano Makame Machano from Zanzibar, and living in Zanzibar 
Town, published Tafsiri ya Qur-an Juzuu ya Pili (Interpretation of the Qur’ān 
Second Juzʾ), as part of his plan to publish the entire Qurʾān, when funds 
allowed. The closing paragraph of the book states that the work was completed

on Thursday 3 February 1994, yet it was not published until 2000, indicating 
the need to raise funds for publishing. The verses are given in Swahili with 
parallel Arabic text. This is followed, after every few verses, by a detailed expla-
nation of the meaning of the verses.
In the Foreword, Machano states:
[K]wa yule mwenye kutaka madhumuni na sababu ya kuandika tafsiri hii 
basi arejee katika juzuu ya kwanza.
For anyone who wishes to know the purpose and reasons for writing this 
interpretation well they should refer to the first juzʾ.
Machano, 2000: i3
Machano further explains that he was born at Donge Mtambili and now 
resides at Mwembe Makumbi, working at Lumumba Secondary School, and 
further explaining that on Saturday and Sunday evenings he can be found at 
Mchangani Mosque, whilst on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings he 
can be found at Saateni Mosque. This information is given in order to encour-
age donations to help the publication of further parts of the Tafsiri. Because 
material so far published by Machano does not include any of the passages 
studied, examples are not included in the Appendix.
More recently, Al-Kashif (an uncovering), an exegetical commentary by 
Sheikh Muhammad Jawad Mughniyya, and translated by Sheikh Hasan 
Mwalupa, has become available through the al-Itrah Foundation. It is versi-
fied with Arabic parallel text. Each sūra begins with the title in transliterated 
Arabic, with a Swahili translation, and where it was revealed. An extensive 
commentary is given after each section of verses. So far only twelve juzuu are 
available.
Several of the versions discussed, as well as Al Farsy, insert explanatory exe-
getical comments.
Parentheses or brackets are used in many versions of the Qurʾān. They serve 
two functions: when the writer wishes to make the reading of the text clearer 
to the reader, and when the writer wishes to make an exegetical comment 
within the text.
In the first case, where words or phrases are included which are not in the 
Arabic text of the Qurʾān, they are enclosed in parentheses, in order to indi-

understand. This can be seen in Yūsuf ʿAlī The Holy Qurʾān, which has been 
criticised for its extensive use of parentheses.
The following extract compares the Yūsuf ʿAlī version with Haleem and 
Al-Farsy for Āl ʿImrān (3):50:
Haleem:
I have come to confirm the truth of the Torah which preceded me, and to 
make some things lawful to you which used to be forbidden. I have come 
to you with a sign from your Lord. Be mindful of God, obey me:
Yūsuf ʿAlī:
(I have come to you), To attest the Law which was before me. And to make 
lawful to you part of what was (before) forbidden to you; with a Sign from 
your Lord. So fear Allah and obey me.
Al-Farsy:
Na (nitakuwa) msadikishaji wa yale yaliyokuwa kabla yangu katikaTau-
rati; na (nimekuja) ili ni kuhalalishieni baadhi ya yale mliyoharimishiwa, 
na nimekujieni na hoja kutoka kwa Mola wenu. Kwa hivyo mcheni 
Mwenyezi Mungu na nitiini.
Yūsuf ʿAlī uses parentheses twice, inserting ‘I have come to you’ and an addi-
tional ‘before’. Both these insertions help to make clear the meaning of the 
verse, although it should be noted that Haleem uses ‘used to’ instead of ‘before’ 
without using parenthesis. Looking at the same verse in the Swahili version by 
Al-Farsy, he inserts nitakuwa (I will be) and nimekuja (I have come), both of 
which clarify the meaning of the verse.
In the second case when the writer chooses to add an exegetical comment 
to the Qurʾānic text it is also enclosed in parentheses. El-Ezabi criticises three 
English versions of the Qurʾān whose writers have used parentheses to com-
ment on the text. Concerning M.M. Khan and M.T. al-Hilālī’s The Noble Qurʾān, 
he says:
In their translation of [Al-Fātiḥa] 1:7, [they] commented within the main 
text in parentheses in a way which suggests this is implicitly understood 
from the text at a time when it is only a commentary based on their

interpretation (or misinterpretation) of the text in question. Their ques-
tionable commentaries are [emphasised in bold] […]

7.	 The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the 
way) of those who earned Your Anger (such as the Jews), nor of those 
who went astray (such as the Christians).
Given that this translation is the official one approved, distributed and 
propagated all over the world by the Saudi authorities […] the deviation 
is significant […].
El-Ezabi, 2005: 6–7
Al-Farsy uses parentheses in order to make the meaning of a verse clear as 
well as to include exegetical commentary. Farouk Topan said, concerning the 
exegetical comments inserted parenthetically in the text of Qurani Takatifu, 
that the translation was based on al-Farsy’s broadcast Friday sermons and as 
such should be considered as a ‘free version’ of the original (Topan, 2007, dis-
cussion). This fits with Trimingham’s opinion regarding al-Farsy’s version as a 
paraphrase (1964: 110, fn. 1).
The five complete versions of the Qurʾān in Swahili are not all readily acces-
sible. The version most used is the one by al-Farsy. Dale’s has been rejected 
as it is by a Christian; Aḥmadi’s has also been rejected as it is by an Aḥmadi 
and so is viewed with suspicion as being heretical. In addition to its perceived 
orthodoxy, al-Farsy’s has had the most copies published, at a subsidised price, 
by the Islamic Foundation. The second edition in 1974 included this statement 
‘25/- Kote Katika Afrika ya Mashariki. Hii ndiyo bei iliyo punguzwa kwa msaada 
wa The Islamic Foundation’ (Twenty Five Shillings everywhere in East Africa. 
This is the price subsidized by The Islamic Foundation). Al-Barwani’s version 
has yet to achieve wide circulation and is sold at around twice the price of 
the al-Farsy version. However, its availability through the internet is making it 
better known and more readily accessible than the other versions. Because it 
appeared after most of the tracts under discussion in this research were pub-
lished, any differences in the interpretation in Al-Barwani’s version have had 
no effect on the texts under discussion.
In this chapter, Swahili as a religious language and its use in different ver-
sions of the Bible and Qurʾān have been described and set in context. The vari-
ety of Swahili dialects is significant as selected tracts are examined in the next 
part. This is because many of the selected texts use non-standard Swahili, and 
reflect dialectical forms of Swahili, particularly in regard to spelling and, occa-
sionally, sentence structure and grammar.

Chapter 6
Tracts in Current Circulation in East Africa
The availability of tracts in East Africa, produced by both Christians and 
Muslims was examined in Part 1. The growth in use of tracts by Muslim writers 
in East Africa was examined through copies of the tracts that were published 
and referred to in archival sources. This was done to understand the develop-
ment of the use of tracts by Muslims, in particular the use of Swahili as the lan-
guage of communication. Likewise, the use of tracts by Christian writers was 
surveyed; Christian tracts were mainly produced by missionaries and often 
translated into Swahili from other languages.
Because the tracts being studied were published in Swahili, an understand-
ing of Swahili’s development as a religious language is important. This is traced 
through archival material, copies of scripture and tracts, and through litera-
ture on the history of Swahili as a language. In particular, the use of Roman 
script, the standardisation of Swahili and the versions of the Bible and Qurʾān 
in Swahili were examined. This historical and linguistic work is a necessary 
preparation for the primary focus of the book.
As explained in chapter 1, to discover what tracts are in current circulation, 
visits were made to various places within East Africa, to a mixture of large cities 
and smaller regional towns, to collect tracts from both Muslim and Christian 
sources. Having collected around a hundred different tracts, those that used 
scripture to promote or defend one faith against the claims of the other were 
examined to find out how scripture was used.
This chapter sets out how this was carried out and how the material is pre-
sented in the following chapters.
1	
Criteria for Selection of the Tracts to Be Examined
Once the tracts had been collected, they were assessed to determine which 
tracts would be examined.
Three criteria were used for selecting the tracts:
–	 Purpose of composition
–	 Language of composition
–	 The use of Scripture

Purpose of Composition
Tracts are written for different purposes; of the ones collected, their purposes 
can be classified as being one or more of the following:
–	 Tracts used for outreach, specifically written for the reader of another faith.
–	 Tracts used for training the faithful in methods of outreach.
–	 Tracts being catechetical in purpose, providing teaching material for the 
believer in order to inform them of the basics of their faith.
As the purpose of this study is to examine the tracts’ use and interpretation 
of scripture, it was decided to select tracts that can be identified as being for 
outreach or for training the faithful in outreach, rather than those that were 
only catechetical.
3	
Language of Composition
It was decided that the tracts selected for study should be ones published in 
Swahili. The reason for this was that one of the aims of the study was to explore 
the use of Swahili as a religious language. Tracts originally written in Swahili 
were looked for in preference to those translated from other languages.
An initial survey found that much of the material written by Christians was 
translated from other languages. This meant that it was necessary to select 
some translated material, as insufficient material originally written in Swahili 
was found.
Of the selected tracts, five were written originally in Swahili, and three were 
translated from other languages, chosen because they fitted the other criteria, 
in their purpose of composition and use of scripture.
It was necessary to have an awareness of the processes involved in writing 
the tracts and using scripture, especially the Muslim view that the versions of 
the Qurʾān in languages other than Arabic can only be considered to be inter-
pretations of scripture and not the scripture itself. Christians have used the 
vernacular for scripture since the earliest times, although in some traditions 
one language became the only acceptable one for scripture.
For instance: the Ethiopian Coptic Church continued to use Gə’əz, long 
after it ceased to be a language known by ordinary people (Wondmagegnehu 
and Motovu, 1970: 51–2); the use of the Latin and the Vulgate by the Roman 
Catholic Church until after the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s (Howell, 
1986: 521).

The Use of Scripture
Scripture is used in tracts to inform and persuade. Both Muslims and Christians 
use their own scriptures in tracts. Many tracts used in outreach, or in training 
for outreach, use scriptures of the other faith.
In the selection process, the presence of passages of scripture was important. 
It was found that the tracts included passages from the Bible and the Qurʾān as 
well as other religious material, notably the use of Ḥadīth and commentaries 
on the Qurʾān. In addition, many of the Muslim tracts included material from 
Western secular writers. For each of the tracts, the range and purpose of quo-
tations from scripture were noted.

The Original Language of Composition
As already noted, five of the selected tracts were originally written in Swahili; 
of these, four were Muslim tracts, whilst only one was a Christian tract. For 
the tracts that have been translated from other languages, it is not always clear 
what language it was originally written in; some may originally have been in 
Arabic, English, German or Urdu.
7	
Title and Subject Matter
All the Muslim tracts selected indicate a concern with Jesus, the Bible and 
Christianity or the Unity of God. There are indications that they were written 
in order to attract Christians, or to assist Muslims in talking to Christians. The 
Christian tracts selected have all been written with the purpose of outreach to 
Muslims, or to assist Christians in talking to Muslims.

Authors of Tracts
The authors of Muslim tracts include some locally well-known Muslim writ-
ers or preachers, such as Saidi Musa, Mussa Fundi Ngariba and Mohamed 
1	 ISIM – International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World, Leiden. In 2000 
Gerard van de Bruinhorst collected over 1,200 tracts and pamphlets in Tanzania and Kenya 
for ISIM; these were catalogued (Bruinhorst, 2001: 6).

Ali Kawemba. Other tracts were selected as they were written by a former 
Christian who became a Muslim, Abbas Gombo Kanoni.
Of the Christian material, one is a testimony written by a former Muslim, 
one is an unsigned tract, giving an address for further information for inter-
ested readers, one is a training worksheet, and one is a signed tract which 
raises issues about the truth of Islam.

Use of Scripture
All the selected tracts use scripture; the extent of this use ranges from Maisha 
ya Nabii Isa (Alahais Salam) by Saidi Musa with nineteen Qurʾānic passages, 
to Kwa Nini Niliacha Ukristo na Nikawa Muislamu by Abbas Gombo Kanoni, 
which has over two hundred Biblical and eleven Qurʾānic passages.

Chapter 6
In order to compare approaches used by Muslim and Christian writers, the 
selected tracts have been grouped into the following categories:
	 Using scripture to refute the other’s faith (chapter seven)
	 Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20 (chapter eight)
	 Testimonies of those who have moved from one faith to the other (chapter 
nine)
	 Teaching material to train readers (chapter ten)
These different approaches are examined by presenting a Muslim and a 
Christian authored tract. In each case, extracts from the tracts are given in 
Swahili, followed by an English translation and an analysis of the way the 
author uses scripture.

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
The Muslim tract examined in this chapter is Uislamu Katika Biblia (Islam in 
the Bible) by Mussa Fundi Ngariba (died 1993) and Mohammed Ali Kawemba, 
and the Christian tract is Isa (Yesu Kristo) Ndani ya Kurani na Biblia (Isa (Jesus 
Christ) in the Qurʾān and Bible) produced by Tanzania Evangelical Literature 
Ministry. Both tracts make extensive use of scripture, both the Bible and the 
Qurʾān, with the purpose of refuting the other’s faith.

Chapter 7
Darul Arquam Islamic Library, 1990, 84 pages. This is a full tran-
script of a meeting held in Tabora in 1986. The transcript includes 
passages that are virtually the same as Uislamu katika Biblia. It is 
possible that this transcript is the basis of Uislamu katika Biblia, 
even though the published version of the transcript post-dates the 
tract.
Mussa Fundi Ngariba (d. 1993) and Mohammed Ali Kawemba,1 both from Ujiji 
in Western Tanzania, are Manyema in origin, in that their grandfathers were 
brought to Ujiji from the Manyema district of the Congo during the nineteenth 
century. Ngariba studied under Shaykh Mussa Hussein in Ujiji (Chande, 1998: 
153). They became well-known during the 1980s when they travelled extensively 
through Tanzania and Kenya with Jumuiya ya Wahubiri wa Kiislamu Tanzania 
(Society of Muslim Preachers of Tanzania; JUWAKITA) speaking about ‘com-
parative religious study’ (Chesworth, 2006: 170). This was conducted in the 
form of mihadhara (public debates), where the two speakers would use the 
Bible to present reasons why Christians had been misled. The tract is based on 
their mihadhara presentations.2
The approach used by Ngariba and Kawemba is strongly influenced by 
Ahmed Deedat who visited Dar es Salaam in 1981 and gave two talks organ-
ised by the Muslim Students’ Association of the University of Dar es Salaam 
(MSAUD) (Njozi, 2000: 11–12). It seems likely that Ngariba and Kawemba and 
the other members of JUWAKITA based their style and approach on Deedat. 
Certainly the Comparative Religious Study approach only began to be used in 
East Africa in 1984, following Deedat’s visit (Aziz, 1998: 2). The tract uses some 
of the same material that Deedat used and it can be supposed that the writ-
ers had access to a selection of Deedat’s tracts and cassette recordings (Smith, 
1988: 107–8; Lacunza Balda, 1993a: 28; Chande, 1998: 153 footnote 36).
The tract is introduced by A.S. Suleiman who explains that Ngariba and 
Kawemba:
1	 Chanfi Ahmed reports that after 2000 Kawemba moved to Oman (Ahmed, 2008: 350).
2	 For a detailed exploration of the methods used by Ngariba and Kawemba see Chesworth, 
2006: 168–72. Joseph Mutei analysed video recordings of mihadhara conducted by Ngariba 
and Kawemba (Mutei, 2012: 35–43); see also Chanfi Ahmed, 2008: 332–50).

Chapter 7
As Suleiman states, the tract was produced for the benefit of those who were 
unable to attend the mihadhara of Ngariba and Kawemba. The way that scrip-
ture is used in the tract shows its origins as material for use in mihadhara. This 
will be reflected on, in the passages from the tract examined below.
The tract begins with a section on One God and the Religion of Islam 
(pp. 1–6). Then a question is asked ‘Nani ameleta dini mpya’ (Who has brought 
a new religion) (p. 7); this is explained as being Paul (pp. 8–12):
Bila ya dini ya Paulo, dini ya Uislamu wa Musa ingaliendelea bila ya kik-
wazo katika Uislamu wa Yesu na kufikia Uislamu kama ulivyofundishwa 
na Nabii Muhammad (S.A.W.).
Without the religion of Paul, the Islam of Moses would have continued 
without hindrance in the Islam of Jesus and arrive at the Islam as taught 
by the Prophet Muḥammad (P.B.U.H.).
page 11
In the next section, the claim of Muḥammad to be the successor to Moses 
is tested against the claims of Jesus (pp. 12–17). The first part concludes with 
a warning of the dangers of false belief (pp. 17–19); this section includes an 
example of material that is also used by Ahmed Deedat, indicating a possible 
source for some of the material that is used in the tract:
Yeye amechaguliwa na mtaalamu wa komputa wa Kimarekani kuwa ni 
wa mwanzo katika watu 100 wakuu katika dunia katika historia.
He [Muḥammad] was chosen by an American computer expert as the 
first among 100 most important people in the world in history.
page 18
This information comes from Muhummed (pbuh) the Greatest by Ahmed 
Deedat, where he cites a book The 100: a ranking of the most influential persons 
in history, by Michael H. Hart, first published in 1978, whom he describes as an 
historian, mathematician and astronomer. Deedat explains that Hart ranked 
the top one hundred from the point of view of their influence on people, and 
that Muḥammad is ranked as number one (Deedat, 1995: 105). The text of 
Muhummed (pbuh) the Greatest is found in The Choice: Islam and Christianity 
Volume One; it is also listed as Booklet number 20, with an off-print of the chap-
ter about Muḥammad from The 100 by Michael Hart as Booklet number 21.

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
The material up to this point reflects the material used by Mussa Fundi 
Ngariba during mihadhara.
The second part of the tract uses the Nguzo za Uislamu (Pillars of Islam) 
(page 20) and reflects the material used by Mohamed Ali Kawemba in talks. 
Each of the Pillars are presented, using passages from the Bible. Shahada 
(Credal statement) (page 20), Sala (Prayer) (pp. 20–7), Kutoa Zaka (The giv-
ing of offerings) (pp. 28–30), Kufunga Mwezi wa Ramadhani (To fast during 
Ramaḍān) (pp. 30–1), Kwenda Kuhiji Makka (Going to Mecca on pilgrimage) 
(pp. 32–4).
For each Pillar, passages from the Bible are used to show that these practices 
are found in the Bible, so demonstrating that Muslims, in following these prac-
tices, were being faithful to God, whereas Christians did not even follow what 
was in the Bible.
The quotes from the Qurʾān are from Qurani Takatifu (al-Farsy) and the 
quotes from the Bible are from Biblia Union Version.
The approach of the tract is polemical, very much reflecting the mihadhara 
it is based on.
In 1998 the then President of Tanzania, Benjamin Mkapa, warned preachers 
of kashfa za dini (religious slander). Mihadhara were then severely restricted 
(Njozi, 2000: 150). A group of Christians led by Cecil Simbaulanga formed 
Biblia ni Jibu (The Bible is the Answer), as a response to the Mihadhara of 
Ngariba and Kawemba.
The preface by Suleiman reflects the polemical approach:
DIBAJI
Masihi bin Maryam hakuwa zaidi isipokuwa ni Mtume (tu). (Na) bila ya 
shaka Mitume wengi wamepita kabla yake. (Hawajaona)? Na Mamake 
ni Mwanamke Mkweli. (Na) Wote wawili walikuwa wakila chakula (na 
kwenda choo. Basi Waungu gani wanaokula na kwenda choo)? Tazama 
jinsi tunavyowabainishia Aya, kisha tazama jinsi wanavyogeuzwa

Katika siku za mwanzo za Uislamu kulikuwa na mashirikiano baina ya 
Waislamu na Wakristo. Waislamu walipokuwa wakiadhibiwa Makka 
mwanzoni mwa risala yake, Mtume Muhammad (s.a.w.) aliwataka baadhi 
ya masahaba wake waende Uhabeshi ambako watu wakiabudu Mungu

The Messiah son of Mary was nothing more other than an Apostle (only). 
(And) without a doubt many Apostles came before him. (Have they not

Qurʾān [Al-Māʾida] 5:75
In the early days of Islam there was co-operation between Muslims 
and Christians. When Muslims were persecuted in Mecca at the start 
of his mission, the Messenger Muḥammad (s.a.w.) wanted a number of 
his companions to go to Ethiopia where people worshipped one God. 
Certainly “People of the BYZANTINE religion, saw the religion of Islam 
as a sprout of ARIANISM and they understood Islam as one of the Sects 
of Christianity” (A. Vasiliev in Byzantinism by Baynes and Moss – p. 309).
Suleiman, in Ngariba and Kawemba: iii
The Preface to the tract begins with Suleiman quoting Al-Māʾida [5]  verse 
75, using the al-Farsy version, whilst the English version uses The Meaning of 
the Glorious Qurʾān by Marmaduke Pickthall. Suleiman does not then use the 
verse directly, rather he uses a quotation by A. Vasiliev, about the Byzantine 
understanding of Islam being a ‘Sect’ of Christianity. The correct details for 
this reference are: Byzantium: an introduction to east Roman civilization edited 
by Norman H. Baynes and H.St.L.B. Moss, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948. The 
actual quote is from A.A. Vasiliev, Chapter 11, ‘Byzantium and Islam’ pp. 308–25. 
The quotation is found on page 309, not 390; it reads: ‘At first Byzantine the-
ologians viewed Islam as a ramification of Arianism and placed it on a level 
with other Christian sects.’ This is the same wording as in the English version 
of the tract.
The Swahili word used, Madhehebu can also be translated as ‘denomina-
tion’, whilst kikundi is also used for ‘sect’. The understanding that Islam was 
initially viewed as a Christian heresy is correct, in that John of Damascus (675–
753) included a chapter on Islam in part two of The Fount of Knowledge: De 
Haeresibus (On Heresies) as one Christian Heresy, out of over one hundred. 
See Daniel Sahas (1972) for the text and commentary on the chapter on Islam.

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
Ngariba and Kawemba start the tract by seeking to demonstrate that 
there is only ‘One God One Religion’. They use Al-Shūrā [42]:13 together with 
Ephesians 4:4–6 to demonstrate that there is only one religion.
Mungu Mmoja Dini Moja:
Vile Mwenyezi Mungu anamwambia Mtume Muhammad katika 
Quran sura 42:13
“Amekupeni sharia ya dini ile ile aliyomuusia Nuhu na tuliyo kufunulia 
wewe na tuliyo wausia Ibrahimu na Mussa na Issa, kwamba simamisheni 
dini wala msifarikiane kwayo, (kwa ajili ya dini); ni ngumu kwa wenye 
kushirikisha (dini hii) unayowaitia; Mwenyezi Mungu humchagua kwake 
amtakaye na humuongoza kwake aelekeaye (kwake).”
Hebu tutazame Biblia inasema nini, kwani ndicho kitabu kilichotan-
gulia na chenye habari ya Mitume iliyokuja kabla ya Mtume Muhammad 
(s.a.w.). Biblia inasema katika Waefeso 4:4–6
“Mwili mmoja, na Roho moja, kama mlivyo itwa katika tumaini moja 
la wito wenu. Bwana mmoja, imani moja, ubatizo mmoja. Mungu mmoja, 
naye ni Baba wa wote, aliye juu ya yote na katika yote na ndani ya yote.”
Maneno haya yanaweza kuelezwa kama hivi:-
Mwili mmoja:
Sisi sote ni asili moja kutoka kwa Nabii Adam (a.s.w.)
Roho moja:
Ujumbe, Ufunuo, wahyi waliopokea Mitume ni aina 
moja.
Tumaini moja:
Kama tulivyoitwa katika tumaini moja la wito na 
ndivyo tunavyotakiwa tuwe katika tumaini moja 
katika kuitikia mbele ya Mola wetu.
Bwana mmoja:
Mwenyezi Mungu kila muda anamtuma Nabii kwa-
watu wake. Na yule nabii huwa ni Bwana kwa hao 
watu.
Imani moja:
Tumeamrishwa kuamini kuwa Mwenyezi Mungu ni 
mmoja, baba wa wote Aliyejuu ya yote, katika yote na 
ndani ya yote.
Kwa ufupi, ilivyokuwa Mwenyezi Mungu ni mmoja na dini lazima iwe 
moja tu.
One God One Religion:
Likewise Almighty God tells the Apostle Muḥammad in the Qurʾān 
Sūra [Al-Shūrā] 42:13

Chapter 7
‘He has given you the law of that same religion that he gave to Noah 
and that which we revealed to you and that which we gave to Abraham 
and Moses and ʿĪsā, that you should strengthen the religion, and not be 
divided, (for the sake of religion); it is hard for those who share in (this 
religion) to which you call them; Almighty God chooses who he wishes 
and leads him so that he should come to (him).’
Well let us look at what the Bible says, because indeed it is the book 
that came before and with news of the Apostles which came before the 
Apostle Muḥammad (s.a.w.). The Bible says in Ephesians 4:4–6
‘One body, and one Spirit, as you were called in the one hope of your 
call. One Lord, one faith, one baptism. One God, and he is Father of all, he 
who is above all and in all and within all.’
These words can be explained in this way:
One Body:
We all have one origin through the Prophet Adam (a.s.)3
One Spirit:
Message, Revelation, inspiration that the Apostles 
received is of one kind.
One Hope:
As we were called in one hope of [our] calling and as 
such we are expected to be of one hope in being called 
before our God.
One Lord:
Almighty God each time sends a Prophet for his people. 
And that Prophet is Lord for those people.
One Faith:
We are commanded to believe that Almighty God is 
one, father of all He who is above all, with all and in 
everything.
Briefly, just as Almighty God is one then it is necessary that religion 
should be one only.
Ngariba and Kawemba: 1–2
Ngariba and Kawemba quote the whole of verse 13 from Al-Shūrā to introduce 
a passage from the New Testament of the Bible, Ephesians 4:4–6, which they 
use to demonstrate the truth of the verse from the Qurʾān. Oneness is seen as 
important; it was used in their mihadhara, as Peter Smith reports concerning 
a Public Debate in Tabora in 1986, ‘The theme of the lectures “The Word of 
God” was introduced with the words: there is one God, one people and one reli-
gion. It is unacceptable then that the people in the audience should be of different 
religions’ (Smith, 1988: 107 his emphasis). Their purpose, as stated by Smith, 
explains the approach used by them in this passage.

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
The various elements of the verses from Ephesians are used to emphasise the 
idea of ‘one’. Most of the appearances of ‘one’ found in the Ephesians verse are 
used, but ‘One Baptism’ is ignored. They are used to demonstrate that ‘Just as 
Almighty God is one then it is necessary that religion should be one only’.
Mwili mmoja (One Body): states that all of humanity is descended from 
Adam, therefore we are all of one body.
Roho moja (One Spirit): the idea that all the prophets received one mes-
sage is stated; Ngariba and Kawemba use Mtume (Apostle/Messenger) rather 
than Nabii (Prophet) in this section. This may reflect that they were specifically 
referring to the rasūl (messenger) rather than to the prophets. Here ‘One’ is 
given in a neutral form moja; in the Bible it has an additional m-, which would 
indicate life, leaving the question as to whether it is deliberate or a typograph-
ical error.
Tumaini moja (One Hope): the use of Mola rather than Mungu for God in 
this context is of note. Mola from the Arabic mawlā (lord), is used for God, but 
can also be used for Lord, in a religious sense, whereas the Arabic mawlā has 
the sense of temporal lordship, rather than spiritual.

Chapter 7
Bwana mmoja (One Lord): The idea that God sends a prophet to a particular 
people, at a specific time, is used by Ngariba and Kawemba. They use Bwana in 
relation to prophet, stating that a prophet is Lord of the people he is sent to. In 
the colonial period, bwana was used as an honorific accorded to the colonial-
ists. More recently it has been mainly used in its religious sense, Bwana being 
used by Christians to refer to Jesus.
Imani moja (One Faith): in this section the supremacy of God is empha-
sised; this consciously reflects the sentiments of both Al-Shūrā 13 and the 
Ephesians 4:4–6 passages, leading to the concluding statement that: ‘If God is 
one, it is necessary that there should only be one religion’.

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
Nataka kumkumbusha msomaji hapa kuwa Yesu, mwana wa Mariamu, 
atarudi kwa ulimwengu huu kabla ya siku ya kiyama.
I want to remind the reader here that Jesus, son of Mary, will return to the 
earth before the day of judgement.
page 1
It then uses the Qurʾān and Ḥadith to show that Jesus will return again. A series 
of questions are asked and answered with references from the Qurʾān.
The second section begins by asking Je, Waweza Kusema Kwamba Yesu Kristo 
Alikuwa Nabii Tu? (Can we say that Jesus Christ was only a Prophet?) and Yesu 
Kristo ni Nani? (Who is Jesus Christ?) (page 2). This section presents passages 
from the Qurʾān and the Bible, set out side by side to answer the question. It 
seeks to demonstrate that Jesus was more than a Prophet.
The third section asks Kwa Nini Akaja Yesu, Basi? (Well, why did Jesus come?) 
and explains Sababu ya Kuja Kwa Yesu (Upendo wa Mungu wakukomboa) (The 
Reason for the Coming of Jesus (The love of God to save)) (page 6). This section 
uses the Bible to demonstrate that Adhabu ya Dhambi ni Mauti (The punish-
ment for sin is death) (page 7) and concludes by setting out the four things 
needed for a person to be saved.
Quotes from the Qurʾān are from Qurani Takatifu (al-Farsy), those from the 
Bible are from Biblia Union Version, ḥadīth are quoted from Ṣaḥiḥ Bukhārī.
It is more polemical than eirenic in its approach.
The tract quotes four of the verses from Āl ʿĪmrān [3]:45–9, verses 45, 47, 46 
then 49, out of sequence, together with Al-Nisāʾ [4]:171, as part of a series of 
statements followed by questions to be considered by the reader.
PILI: Kurani Husema: Yesu Kristo ndiye NENO LA MWENYEZI 
MUNGU (ALLAH) (Sura No. 3 Aali Imran:45) (Kumbukeni) waliposema 
Malaika: “Ewe Mariamu! Mwenyezi Mungu anakupa habari njema lito-
kalo kwake: Jina lake Masihi, Isa….
Swali: Je, nabii mwingine awaye yote awezakusema eti yeye ni Neno la 
Mwenyezi Mungu (ALLAH)?
SECONDLY: The Qurʾān says: Jesus Christ is indeed the WORD OF 
ALMIGHTY GOD (ALLĀH) (Sūra No. 3 Āl ʿĪmrān:45)
(Remember) when the Angels said: “Oh Mary! Almighty God gives you 
good news that comes from him: His name is Messiah, ʿĪsā….
Question: Is there any other prophet who is able to say that he is the 
Word of Almighty God (Allāh)? (TELM Isa:1)

Chapter 7
The tract calls Jesus the Word of Almighty God, however, through what may 
well be a failure in proof-reading the tract omits neno (word) from the verse 
quoted, thus the meaning of the statement and subsequent question is lost. 
Al-Farsy reads:
Ewe Maryamu! Mwenyezi Mungu anakupa khabari njema za (kumzaa 
mtoto bila ya mume, bali kwa kutamkwa) Neno tu litokalo Kwake (la 
kukwambia ‘Zaa’ ukazaa pasina kuingiliwa). Jina lake ni Masih, Isa […].

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
Oh Mary! Almighty God brings you good news of (giving birth to a child 
without a man, rather by pronouncement) a Word that only comes from 
Him (of telling you to ‘Bear’ without intercourse). His name is Messiah, 
Īsā […].
Āl ʿĪmrān (3):45
It is possible that when the writers copied the verse from al-Farsy, they became 
confused by the bracketed insertions and so omitted Neno. All the Swahili ver-
sions include Neno in the verse, as do English versions by Haleem, Pickthall 
and Yūsuf ʿAli.
‘Word’ is understood in different ways by Muslims and Christians. The 
Christian doctrine of the ‘Word’ is that the Bible is the written Word of God 
and that Jesus is the Word of God made flesh (Kateregga and Shenk, 1985: 109). 
The Muslim understanding of ‘Word’ is that Jesus is ‘a Word from God’. For 
the Muslim view of Word, see Geoffrey Parrinder ‘Jesus as Word’ (1996: 45–8); 
Matthias Radscheit, ‘Word of God’ (2006b: 541–8).
The Christian understanding of ‘Word’ is presented in the tract, claiming 
that Jesus alone is the Word of Almighty God.
TATU: Kurani husema: Yesu Kristo ni Roho iliyotoka kwake Mwenyezi 
Mungu.
“Masihi Isa bin Mariamu ni Mtume wa Mwenyezi Mungu na tamko 
lake alilompelekea Mariamu. Na ni roho iliyotoka kwake.” (Sura No. 4 An 
Nisaa: 171)
Swali: Tena, kunaye nabii yeyote mwingine awezaye kudai kwamba 
yeye ni Neno la Mwenyezi Mungu (ALLAH) na Roho kutoka kwake?
THIRDLY: The Qurʾān says: Jesus Christ is a Spirit that came from 
Almighty God himself.
“The Messiah Jesus son of Mary is an Apostle of Almighty God and his 
proclamation [word] that he brought to Mary. And he is a spirit which 
came from him” (Sūra No. 4 Al-Nisāʾ:171).
Question: Again, is there any other prophet who is able to assert that 
he is the Word of Almighty God (ALLĀH) and the Spirit from him? 
(TELM Isa:2)
Only a part of the verse is quoted, not including the reference to the Trinity. 
The role of Jesus as the Word of Almighty God and the Spirit from God and 
the uniqueness of Jesus’s relationship with God is emphasised, without any 
explanation.

Chapter 7
The statements continue by quoting verses Āl ʿĪmrān [3]:47, 46 and then 49:
NNE: Kurani huhubiri kuzaliwa kwa Yesu Kristo na Mwanamwali (Bikira)
Alisema (mwanamwali Mariamu) “Mola wangu! Nitapataje mtoto, na 
hali mtu ye yote hakunigusa?” (Sura No. 3 Aali Imran:47)
Swali: Kwa nini Kristo ndiye alichaguliwa awe na uzazi huu wa aina 
ya pekee usio wa kawaida? Hakuna mtu mwingine yeyote kabla yeye au 
baada yake aliyezaliwa kwa njia hii ya ajabu ambayo ni vigumu kuaminika

na yenye ishara kuu. Kwa nini akawa ni Kristo? Kwa nini Mwenyezi 
Mungu (Allah) alichagua kuingilia na kugeuza njia ya maumbile iliyo ya 
kawaida ya uzazi kwa namna hii?
TANO: Kurani husema: Yesu Kristo alihubiri tangu utoto. “Naye atazu-
ngumza na watu katika utoto wake na katika utu uzima wake na atakuwa 
katika watu wema (kabisa).” (Sura No. 3 Aali Imran:46)
Swali: Je, nabii awaye yote aweza kudai kuwa mtakatifu?
SITA: Kurani husema kuwa Kristo aliishi ulimwenguni ili awaongoze 
watu kwenye Haki na kufanya ishara iliyokuu pamoja na kuwafufua wafu! 
(Sura No. 3 Aali Imran:49).
FOURTHLY: The Qurʾān preaches about the birth of Jesus Christ by a 
Maiden (Virgin)
She said (the maiden Mary) “Oh my Lord! How will I get a child, when 
no man has touched me?” (Sūra No. 3 Āl ʿĪmrān:47)
Question: Why was Christ chosen to have this birth of a kind that was 
unique and not usual? There is no other person before him or after him 
who was born in this amazing way which is difficult to believe in and is 
a major sign. Why did he become Christ? Why did Almighty God (Allāh) 
choose to enter in and to change the way of creation from the usual for 
birth in this way?
FIFTHLY: The Qurʾān says: Jesus Christ preached from childhood.
“And he will talk with people in his childhood and in his adulthood 
and he will be among good people (absolutely).” (Sūra No. 3 Āl ʿĪmrān:46)
Question: Is any among the prophets able to claim that he is holy?
SIXTHLY: The Qurʾān says that Christ lived on the earth so that he 
should lead the people in Justice and to perform great signs as well as 
raising people from the dead! (Sūra No. 3 Āl ʿĪmrān:49) (TELM Isa:2).
Only the first part of verse 47 is quoted. It is prefaced by a statement that Jesus’s 
birth by a mwanamwali (maiden), then adding bikira (virgin), is related in the 
Qurʾān.
Mwanamwali (mwali) has a range of nuanced meanings, here it seems to 
suggest a girl who has reached puberty and started menstruating. The word is 
formed by joining mwana child, offspring, with mwali girl of marriageable age 
(Mulokozi, 2001: 233–5).
The question that is asked appears to be an attempt to lead the reader to 
consider why God chose to make Jesus so different in terms of his ‘unique’ 
birth.

Chapter 7
The fifth statement states that the Qurʾān says that Jesus preached from 
his childhood. Verse 46 is then quoted in full. The question that is asked, con-
cerning whether a prophet can claim to be holy, does not directly relate either 
to the verse or the statement. The tract seems to want the reader to question 
whether any prophet, other than Jesus, can be called holy.
The sixth statement in the sequence is the final one and has no question. It 
quotes a part of verse 49, stating that Jesus lived on earth to lead all people in 
justice, performing signs and raising people from the dead.
The tract uses verses from Āl ʿĪmrān in the sequence 47, 46 then 49, later 
using 45; it is not clear as to why they are used in this sequence, rather than in 
numerical order.
The tract later quotes verse 45 in full, set in parallel with verses from John’s 
Gospel, which use Word as a title for Jesus.
NENO LA MUNGU
Sura No. 3 Aali-Imran:45
(Kumbukeni) waliposema Malaika: “Ewe Mariamu! Mwenyezi Mungu 
anakupa habari njema (kumzaa mtoto bila ya mume, bali kwa kutamkwa) 
neno tu litokalo kwake. Jina lake ni Masih, Isa (Kristo Yesu).”
Yohana 1:1, 14
“Hapo mwanzo kulikuwako Neno … naye Neno alikuwa Mungu.” 
“Naye Neno alifanyika mwili, akakaa kwetu; nasi tukauona utukufu wake, 
utukufu kama wa Mwana pekee atokaye kwa Baba; amejaa neema ya 
kweli.”
THE WORD OF GOD
Sūra No. 3 Āl ʿĪmrān:45
“(Remember) when the Angels said: ‘Oh Mary! Almighty God brings 
you good news (to give birth to a child without a husband, rather by a 
pronouncement) a word only coming from him. His name is Messiah, 
ʿĪsā (Jesus Christ)’.”
John 1:1, 14
“In the beginning was the Word … and the Word was God.” “And the 
Word was made flesh, he lived amongst us; and we saw his glory, glory like 
that of the only Son who comes from the Father; he was filled with true 
grace” (TELM Isa:4).
Verse 45 is quoted correctly, including neno, and also including one of al-Farsy’s 
inserted comments. The two passages have no explanatory comment, apart

Using Scripture to Refute the Other’s Faith
from the heading ‘The Word of God’. It must be assumed that the reader will 
understand that the Bible refers to Jesus as the ‘Word made flesh’.
Both tracts use a large number of passages of scripture, in an attempt to 
convince the reader of the truth of the faith being argued for at the expense 
of the other faith. This is done through refutation as well as reinterpretation of 
the texts. In several cases only parts of passages are used, giving rise to the risk 
that the meaning of the text may be misunderstood. The two tracts make use 
of the other’s scripture with the express purpose of making truth claims about 
their own faith.

Saidi Musa wrote his tract in Swahili, whilst Iskander Jadeed’s tract is trans-

Both tracts make extensive use of the Qurʾān, in fact Saidi Musa only quotes 
the Qurʾān and makes no direct reference to the Bible.

Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20
Region, Tanzania, growing up as a Muslim; after completing Primary School, he 
moved to the coast in 1962 and began to study under Abdalla al-Farsy, who con-
sidered him as his ‘heir’. In the ijāza (certificate) given to Saidi Musa by al-Farsy 
in 1980, it states that ‘the line of transmission and knowledge went back to 
Sheikh al-Amin b. Aly’ (Lacunza Balda, 1989: 250). Saidi Musa established 
an Islamic training centre in his home village, the Simbom Centre, Ugweno, 
Moshi. Lacunza Balda says that Saidi Musa has influenced other Muslims in 
East Africa, whilst managing not to identify himself with any specific Muslim 
group (Lacunza Balda, 1997: 115).
Roman Loimeier says that Saidi Musa ‘could be regarded as a major thinker 
of reformist Islam in Tanzania. He has published numerous texts on issues of 
Islam, mostly in Kiswahili, among them a biography of his teacher’ (2005a: 223, 
see also pp. 584–5 for a biographical entry on Saidi Musa). He also reports that 
Saidi Musa had moved to live in Dar es Salaam.
This tract relates the story of ʿĪsā (Jesus), using the Qurʾān as its source, with-
out any references to the Bible. Saidi Musa uses Isa for Jesus, rather than Yesu; 
where this appears ʿĪsā is given rather than Jesus in the English translation. 
Several of the other tract writers use Isa interchanging it with Yesu. It begins 
with ʿĪsā’s grandparents (pp. 5–7), the birth and up-bringing of Mary, his mother 
(pp. 8–10) and his own birth (pp. 11–16). It is made clear that ʿĪsā is not the Son 
of God (pp. 16–18). ʿĪsā’s life, upbringing and call are presented (pp. 18–21). ʿĪsā 
preaches to the people and they demand a miracle (pp. 21–2). Various miracles 
are presented by ʿĪsā, by permission of Almighty God (pp. 22–33). There is then 
an ‘Admonition’:
Mwenyezi Mungu hakuzaa wala hakuzaliwa; wala hakujizaa kwani 
wakati aliokuwa hayuko.
Almighty God did not give birth nor was he born; nor did he give birth to 
himself because there is no time when he was not present.
page 34
The opening phrase quotes Al-Ikhlāṣ (112):3 with an additional comment.This 
is explained in the remainder of the tract (pp. 34–40).
The quotes from the Qurʾān are similar to Qurani Takatifu (al-Farsy), with 
some minor alterations. The passages quoted are given in Arabic and Swahili, 
verse by verse. Saidi Musa may have produced his own Swahili version of the 
passages.

Chapter 8
The Bible is not directly quoted, but several Biblical passages are retold in 
Musa’s own words.
The approach of the tract is polemical, whilst retaining a high respect for 
Jesus.
Having earlier used verses Al-Māʾida (5):112–15 (pp. 29–31), Musa uses 
Al-Māʾida (5):116–20.
Musa sets the passage in its context of qiyāma (Resurrection) on the yawm 
ad-Dīn (the day of judgement). He then gives a lengthy explanation of the 
passage.

SIKU YA KIYAMA NABII ISA A.S. ATAKANUSHA KUWA 
HAKUWAAMBIA WATU WAKE WAMFANYEYEYE NA MAMA 
YAKE KUWA NI WAUNGU:
Mwenyezi Mungu amesema katika Qurani Juzuu ya 7 ya Suratil Maidah 
katika Aya ya 116–120 kuwa:
Na (kumbukeni) atakaposema Mwenyezi Mungu: Ewe Isa bin 
Maryam! Je, wewe uliwaambia watu; Nifanyeni mimi na Mama yangu 
kuwa waungu badala ya Mwenyezi Mungu? (Nabii Isa) asema: Utakatifu 
ni wako (huna mshirika). Hainifalii mimi kusema ambayo sihaki yangu 
(kuyasema) kama ni ngalisema bila shaka ungalijua, unayajua yaliyomo 
nafsini mwangu, lakini mimi si yajui yaliyomo nafsini mwako. Kwa hakika 
wewe ndiye mjuzi wa yaliyofichikana.”
Sikuwaambia lolote ila yale uliyoniamrisha ya kwamba: Mwabuduni 
Mwenyezi Mungu, Mola wangu na Mola wenu. Na nilikuwa shahidi juu 
yao nilipokuwa nao, na uliponiondosha wewe ukawa mchungaji juu yao 
na wewe shahidi.

Chapter 8
Ikiwa utawaadhibu, basi bila shaka hao ni watumwa wako na kama 
utawaacha, basi hakika wewe ndiye mwenye nguvu na mwenye hekima.
Mwenyezi Mungu atasema: Hii ndiyo siku ambayo wasemao kweli, 
utawafaa ukweli wao. Watapata bustani zipitazo mbele yake mito. Humo 
watakaa milele. Mwenyezi Mungu amewawia radhi nao wewe radhi naye 
huko ndiko kufuzu kulikoku kubwa.
Mweneyzi Mungu mwenye ufalme wa mbingu na ardhi na vilivyoku-
wemo. Naye ni muweza juu ya kila kitu.
MAELEZO:
Imekuwa ni ada kuwa watu wanazaliwa kutokana na Baba na Mama. 
Lakini Nabii Isa amezaliwa bila ya Baba, kama Nabii Adam alivyoumbwa 
bila ya Baba wala Mama, na Hawa alivyoumbwa kutokana na Baba bila 
Mama. Huu ni uwezo wa Mwenyezi Mungu tu. Amefanya yote (1) Adam 
bila Baba wala Mama (2) Hawa bila Mama ila Baba (3) Isa bila Baba ila 
Mama.
Kuonyesha kuwa hakuna limshindalo Mwenyezi Mungu kwani ni 
mwenye mamlaka ya kila kitu asiyeshindwa na chochote. Amefanya hivyo 
ili kutuonyesha kwamba anaweza kuumba watu kwa namna aitakayo. 
Kwa Mungu hakuna la ajabu limshindalo kama ilivyo kwa wanadamu.
Wamepotea watu zama walipodai kuwa Isa na Mama yake ni waungu 
na hali hakuna dalili hata moja inayothibitisha madai hayo.
Basi siku ile ya Kiyama ambayo Mwenyezi Mungu atakusanya viumbe 
katika hadhara, kwa ajili ya hisabu yao; Mwenyezi Mungu atamwuliza 
Mtume Isa kwa kuwasimanga wale makafiri hali ya kusema: “Ati wewe 
uliwaambia watu kuwa: Nifanyeni mimi na mama yangu waungu wawili 
asiyekuwa Mwenyezi Mungu?” Basi Nabii Isa atasema: “Nakutakasa ewe 
Mola utakasifu unaokuwa laiki yako. Hainiwii kwangu niseme yale yasio 
kuwa ni haki yako! Bila shaka ningalisema hivyo mjuzi ni wewe; hakika 
wewe unajua yaliyofichika na katika kifua changu. Ni kweli kwamba 
mimi sikusema ila yale uliyoniamrisha. Nimefikisha utume ulionituma. 
Nikiwaambia watu wangu wakuabudu wewe peke yako wala wasikufanye 
kuwa una mshirika. Nikawa ninawakazania wakutii twaa ya kweli kweli. 
Uliponiondosha wewe ndiye uliyekuwa mchungaji wao kwa kujua wali-
yotenda na waliyosema na wao ni waja wako. Ukipenda utawaadhibu ili 
adhabu hiyo iwe ni malipo yao ya kumwabudu asiyekuwa wewe, na kama 
ukipenda utawasamehe.”
Basi Nabii Isa hakuwaamrisha watu wake wamfanye kuwa yeye ni 
Mwanawa Mungu bali watu ndio waliomsingizia.

Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20
ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT THE PROPHET ʿĪSĀ (AS) WILL 
DENY THAT HE TOLD HIS PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE 
HE AND HIS MOTHER AS GODS:
Almighty God said in the Qurʾān 7th Juzʾ of Sūra Al-Māʾida [5] in verses 
116–120 that:
And (remember) when Almighty God will say: Oh ʿĪsā son of Mary! Did 
you tell people; Make me and my Mother gods instead of Almighty God? 
(Prophet ʿĪsā) says: Holiness is yours (you have no associate). It is not 
proper for me to say that which is not my right (to say) if I said it no doubt 
you would know, you know what is in my soul, but I do not know what is 
inside your soul. Certainly you are the discerner of that which is hidden.”
I did not tell them anything other than that which you commanded 
me that: You should worship Almighty God, my Lord and your Lord. And 
I was a witness concerning them when I was with them, and when you 
removed me you became pastor to them and you are a witness.
If you will admonish them, then no doubt they are your slaves and if 
you leave them, then certainly you indeed are powerful and wise.
Almighty God will say: This indeed is the day that the truthful will ben-
efit from their truthfulness. They will receive gardens with rivers passing 
through them. There they will live eternally. Almighty God is indeed con-
tented with them and they are contented with him.
Almighty God with dominion of heaven and earth and all that is within 
it. He is the enabler of everything.
EXPLANATION
It is customary that people are born from a Father and Mother. But 
Prophet ʿĪsā was born without a Father, as Prophet Adam was created 
without Father or Mother, and Eve was created from a Father without 
a Mother. This is through the ability of Almighty God only. He did all 
(1) Adam without a Father or Mother (2) Eve without a Mother but a 
Father (3) ʿĪsā without a Father but a Mother.
To demonstrate that there is nothing that defeats Almighty God 
because he has authority over everything and he is not defeated by any-
thing. He did this so as to show us that he is able to create people in the 
way that he wishes. For God there is no wonder that defeats him as it is 
for humanity.
When people claim that ʿĪsā and his Mother are gods they are eternally 
lost and there are no signs even one that prove these claims.
So on that day of Judgement when Almighty God will gather creatures 
in a meeting, in order to count them; Almighty God will ask the Apostle

Chapter 8
ʿĪsā to deride those infidels who said: “Say did you tell people that: Make 
me and my mother as two gods in order that he should not be Almighty 
God?” So Prophet ʿĪsā will say: “I sanctify you oh Lord sanctification that 
is appropriate to you. It is not for me to say that which is not your right. 
No doubt if I had said this discernment is yours; certainly you know what 
is hidden in my breast. It is true that I did not say other than what you 
commanded me. I have completed the errand that you sent me on. I told 
my people to worship you alone and that they should not make you to 
have an associate. I have emphasised to them that they should truly truly 
silently submit to you. When you removed me you indeed were their pas-
tor knowing what they did and said and they are your slaves. If you want 
you will punish them so that this punishment is their payment for wor-
shipping that which was not you, and if you wish you will forgive them.”
So Prophet ʿĪsā did not command his people to make him Son of God 
rather people indeed falsely accused him.
Musa: 35–7
Musa uses the passage to introduce a wider argument concerning Jesus’s ori-
gins. He compares Jesus not having a Father with Adam and Eve, not to show 
that Jesus is less than them, but to show that nothing is impossible for God and 
that he can do anything that he wishes.
In verse 116, Musa uses hainifalii (it is not proper for me) whilst Al-Farsy uses 
hainijuzii (it is not suitable for me). Al-Barwani and Mughniyya also use haini-
falii, Dale uses hainijuzu, the Aḥmadi and Mayunga versions use hainipasi (it is 
not appropriate for me). In standard Swahili a negative ending to a verb, in the 
present tense, changes the concluding vowel to -i. The double -ii ending is not 
Standard Swahili. As a Verb, -falii comes from -faa (be proper), forming -falia in 
the prepositional form, the final -a changing to -i in the negative.
Musa then comments on the passage, clearly stating that those who believe 
that Jesus and Mary are gods are eternally lost. The idea that Christians believed 
that Mary was also a god arose because the Church had called Mary Theotokos 
(God Bearer) from the time of Origen in the third century, and approved the 
title at the Councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451); the Latin title Dei 
Genetrix (Mother of God) makes it even more explicit. In this he is following 
classical tafsīr and the Muslim refutation of Christian understanding of Mary 
(Stowasser, 2003: 295).
Musa explains the meaning of the passage by re-telling it in an expanded 
form. He emphasises that Jesus had done as God had asked him to, stating that 
those who had not followed the teaching that Jesus had given them, from God, 
should be punished.
The second tract examined in this chapter is:

Not Abrogated 48 pages
Jadeed Iskander came from an elite Muslim family in Syria and was born in 
1929. Entering military service during the Second World War, serving in the 
Free French army, he became a Christian and for many years wrote evangelis-
tic books and tracts. He died in 1989. In For the sake of the Truth, he recounts 
the story of ‘Taufik’, which is an account of his life. Several of his publications 
are available through Njia ya Uzima, including: Yanipasa nifanye nini nipate 
Kuokoka? (What must I do to be saved?); Msalaba katika Injili na Qurani (The 
Cross in the Gospel and the Qurʾān); Tunasali Vipi? (How should we pray?); 
Kutokosea kwaTorati na Injili (The Infallibility of the Torah and the Gospel).
This tract is part of the Njia ya Uzima correspondence course. It examines 
the idea of abrogation, arguing that the religion of Christ has not been super-
seded by Islam. Jadeed uses the Qurʾān and the Bible, together with al-Ṭabarī 
and al-Jalālayn, to demonstrate that Christianity has not been abrogated.
In this tract Iskander Jadeed seeks to refute the claim made by a 
correspondent:
Sisi Waislamu tumetunukiwa na neema ya Mungu kwa sababu ameifanya 
Kurani yetu iambatane na dini zote za mbinguni. Kwa sababu hiyo, dini 
ya Kiislamu imbatilisha dini zingine zote zilizokuwako kabla yake
We Muslims have been favoured by God because He has made our Qur’an 
inclusive of all the heavenly religions. Thus, Islam has abrogated all the 
religions that proceeded it.

Chapter 8
He starts by setting out the HOJA: (Purpose) of the tract (p. 2) then addresses 
the correspondent as Ndugu Yangu Mpendwa (My dear brother) (pp. 3–6) with 
his own question:
Kwa nini (mimi) ninaamini kwamba Yesu alikufa au kwamba aliuawa, 
huku Kurani inasema kwamba Mungu alimfufua?
Why do (I) believe that Jesus died or that he was killed, when in the 
Qur’an it says that God raised him up?
Before making several references to al-Tabari and the Qurʾān to make his case.
The tract then addresses the question of abrogation, Je, Uislamu Unabatilisha 
Dini Nyingine Zote Zilizotangulia? (Does Islam Abrogate All Religions that 
preceded it?) (pp. 6–21) using several passages from the Qurʾān. Only in the 
final pages does he quote the Bible.
The passages quoted from the Qurʾān use the Qurani Takatifu (al-Farsy) and 
the passages quoted from the Bible use Biblia Union Version.
The tract is polemical in approach and tone.

Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20
Jadeed uses Al-Nisāʾ verse 157 in relation to Al-Māʾida (5):116–17 as part of a 
discussion as to whether or not Jesus died. Part of this passage is shown in 
Figure 8.4.
Kwa hakika, kuna vifungu katika Kurani ambavyo vinasuluhisha swala la 
kama Kristo alikufa, ijapokuwa wafafanuzi wengine wameshikilia kabisa 
ile tafsiri ya moja kwa moja ya maneno haya, “Hali hawakumwua wala 
hawakumsulubu” (Surat An Nisaa: 157). Kwanza kabisa kati ya vifungu 
hivyo ni maneno ya Kurani ambako Mwenyezi Mungu anasema kwamba:
“Ewe Isa bin Maryamu! Je, wewe uliwaambia watu ‘Nifanyeni mimi na 
mama yangu kuwa waungu badala ya Mwenyezi Mungu?’ Aseme (Nabii 
Isa) ‘Wewe umetakasika … Sikuwaambia lolote ila yale uliyoniamrisha … 
na uliponikamilisha muda wangu, Wewe ukawa mchungaji juu yao.’” 
(Surat Al Maidah 116–117)
Certainly, there are some verses in the Qurʾān that reconcile the ques-
tion of whether Christ died, although other interpreters have completely

grasped that interpretation of these words in detail, “They did not kill nor 
crucify him” (Sūra Al-Nisāʾ:157). First of all in these verses are the words of 
the Qurʾān where Almighty God says that:
“Oh ʿĪsā son of Mary! Did you tell people ‘Make me and my mother gods 
instead of Almighty God?’ He said (Prophet ʿĪsā) ‘You are sanctified … I did 
not tell them anything other than that which you commanded … and when 
you completed my time, You became their pastor.’” (Sūra Al-Māʾida 116–117) 
Jadeed: 5–6
Jadeed uses the passage to argue that Jesus did indeed die. The English version 
of the tract has ‘and when you let me fall asleep (die)’, whilst the Swahili reads 
‘uliponi kamilisha muda wangu’ (and when you completed my time), which 
is far less specific, as the verb kamilisha is not automatically associated with 
death. The Arabic root word for -kamili is kamāla which has a range of mean-
ings – complete, finish, bring to perfection (Bosha, 1993: 123).
Jadeed quotes Raḥmat Allāh al-Kayrānawī’s Iẓhār al-ḥaqq to introduce the 
verse and the idea that the scriptures that preceded the Qurʾān are not super-
seded by the Qurʾān.
Katika kitabu chake kiitwacho, Idhhar Al-Haqq, Hajj Rahmat Allah 
Al-Hindi alisema kwamba,
“Ile hoja kwambaTorati imebatilishwa na Zaburi na kwamba Zaburi 
imebatilishwa na Injili na kwamba Injili imebatilishwa na Kurani haina 
msingi wo wote katika Kurani wala katika Hadith.”
Huyo msomi amesema ukweli katika hayo aliyoyasema. Kurani, 
kinyume na hoja za wale wanaoamini katika kubatilishwa, hukana kabisa 
hoja hizo, kwakuwa inasema kwamba:
“Amekupeni Sharia ya dini ile ile aliyomuusia Nuhu na tuliyokufunulia 
wewe na tuliyowausia Ibrahimu na Musa na Isa, kwamba simamisheni 
dini wala msifarikiane kwayo” (Suratush Shuura: 13).
Kwa vile hayo ndiyo maoni ya Kurani kuhusu dini iliyoitangulia, 
nijambo la upuzi kusema kwamba Kurani imebatilisha Biblia au kwamba 
Uislamu umebatilisha yale yaliyoitangulia kuhusu dini ya Mungu kati-
kaTorati na Injili. Siwezi kufahamu jinsi Mwislamu yeyote anavyokubali 
kushikilia maoni hayo na huku shabaha kubwa ya Kurani yake ni kum-
wongoza kwa maagizo na sheria za watu wa Kitabu, kwa maana inasema 
kwamba:
“Mwenyezi Mungu anataka kukubainishieni na kukuongozeni katika 
mwendo wa wale waliokutangulieni, na kukukhafifishieni. Na Mwenyezi 
Mungu ni Mjuzi na Mwenye hikima!” (Surat An Nisa: 26).

Jesus in the Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):112–20
In his book which is called, Iẓhār al-ḥaqq, Hajj Raḥmat Allāh Al-Hindi 
said that,
“The claim that the Torah has been abrogated by the Psalms and that 
the Psalms have been abrogated by the Gospel and the Gospel has been 
abrogated by the Qurʾān has absolutely no foundation in the Qurʾān nor 
in the Hadith.”
This learned person stated the truth in what he said. The Qurʾān, oppo-
site to what those believers in abrogation say, denies these views com-
pletely, as it says that:
“He has given you this Law of religion the same as he gave Noah and 
which we revealed to you and we gave to Abraham and Moses and ʿĪsā, 
that you strengthen the religion and do not differ from them.” (Sūra 
Al-Shūrā: 13).
Therefore, this is indeed the view of the Qurʾān concerning religions 
that preceded it, it is a matter of folly to say that the Qurʾān has abrogated 
the Bible or that Islam has abrogated that which came before concerning 
the religion of God in the Torah and Gospel. I can’t understand how any 
Muslim agrees to hold these views and here the main intention of the 
Qurʾān is to guide by the injunctions and laws of the people of the Book, 
because it says that:
“Almighty God wishes to make clear to you and to lead you in the ordi-
nances of those who came before you; and to turn to you [in Mercy]. And 
Almighty God is All-Knowing All-Wise!” (Sūra Al-Nisāʾ [4]: 26) 
Jadeed: 13–14
The quotation from Iẓhār al-ḥaqq together with the verse from Al-Shūrā is used 
to deny the charge made by Muslims that the Qurʾān has abrogated (naskh) the 
earlier books from God, particularly the Tawrat (Torah) and Injīl (Gospel). The 
way that the quotation is used appears to give it a different meaning to that 
which Raḥmat Allāh intended, in that he denies a sequential abrogation, with 
the Psalms superseding the Torah, then the Psalms being superseded by the 
Gospel, rather than abrogation of the Bible by the Qurʾān.
The verse from Al-Shūrā is used to support the contention that the earlier 
books have not been superseded. This is supported by the use of Al-Nisāʾ (4):26 
which indicates that the earlier books have a continuing purpose.
Whilst it appears that Jadeed had read Iẓhār al-ḥaqq, in fact the quotation 
he gives comes from William St Clair Tisdall’s 1910 revised English edition of 
Pfander’s Mīzān al-ḥaqq (The balance of truth):

Chapter 8
Shaikh Ḥājī Raḥmatuʾllāh of Dehli, in his Iẓhāruʾl Ḥaqq ( ّ�إ  ظ هارا لْحق), pub-
lished in A.H. 1284, Vol. i, pp. 11 and 12, says that the statement that the 
Taurāt was abrogated by the Zabūr and the Zabūr by the appearance of 
the Injīl ‘is a falsehood of which there is no trace in the Qurʾān or in the 
Commentaries….’
Pfander, 1986: 58
Jadeed presents the quotation as if it was directly from a Muslim source, 
whereas, in fact he quotes a Christian source, who is quoting from a Muslim 
source. The quotation given from Iẓhār al-ḥaqq is not found in the current 
English edition (2003). It seems that Tisdall quoted from an Arabic edition, as 
the quotation is given in Arabic as a footnote.
Both tracts use the Qurʾān to discuss Jesus in order to demonstrate the truth 
of their own understanding of who Jesus was and that their own faith is the 
true faith.
The authors each use the verses from this passage for their own different 
purposes. Musa uses it to further discuss Jesus’s origins, broadly following clas-
sical tafsīr. Jadeed also makes use of tafsīr, to further his own arguments in 
defence of Christianity, using the passage to examine whether Jesus actually 
died.

Testimonies of Converts
The two tracts discussed in this chapter are written by people who have con-
verted to the other faith, explaining why they chose to leave their faith and join 
the other. One is by a Tanzanian, and written in Swahili, explaining why he 
became a Muslim; the other by an Indian, translated into Swahili, explaining 
why he became a Christian.

ground. He states that he was born in 1933 and grew up in Ndonno, Tabora 
Region, that his parents were Roman Catholic Christians, and that he was bap-
tised Paul, and attended Shule ya Seminari (Junior Seminary) at Itaga, Tabora. 
Junior Seminaries are Secondary Schools, which are used by the Catholic 
Church as a part of the process of preparing candidates for the priesthood. 
However not all students who attend a Junior Seminary would go forward to a 
Senior Seminary for further training. He explains that the school was a:

[…] shule ambayo huwateyarisha [sic] wanafunzi wake wapate kuwa 
Mapadri.
[…] a school that prepared its students in order that they should become 
Priests.
Kanoni:i
He states that he was a Christian from childhood until the month of Ramaḍān 
in 1968 when he changed his religion. In his second tract Sikumkana Yesu Bali 
Mtume Paulo he refers to his father-in-law being an Anglican priest, serving 
at Muheza, Tanga Region. In both tracts, he gives his address as PO Box 801, 
Arusha, Tanzania.
This tract, at one hundred pages long, is the longest of those selected. Using 
over two hundred passages from the Bible, as well as 11 from the Qurʾān, it has 
the greatest number of references of any of the tracts studied.
The tract sets out to demonstrate, using the Bible, why the writer ceased to 
be a Christian and became a Muslim. The first section, Mungu Mmoja Katika 
Nafsi Tatu (One God with three persons) (pp. 2–30), examines the paradox of 
the Christian Trinity.
In an ‘excursus’, (pp. 22 and 59–60), the differences found between two ver-
sions of the Swahili New Testament are used to show that Christians caused 
the deliberate ‘corruption’ (taḥrīf) of the Bible.
The next section, Je, Yesu Alitumwa Kuwaongoza Watu Gani? (Which people 
was Jesus sent to lead?) (pp. 30–45) sets out to demonstrate that Jesus was sent 
to the Jews and not to others.
The following section, (pp. 46–69), examines the ways in which Christian 
beliefs and actions are wrong, including sub-sections on drunkenness 
(pp. 50–2) and statues in churches (pp. 54–6).
The final section, (pp. 69–100), introduces Muḥammad as a Prophet fore-
told in the Bible: in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament by Jesus and 
by John in the Book of Revelation. The author also uses the Gospel of Barnabas 
(pp. 89–91). The tract concludes by comparing Christianity with Islam.
The quotes from the Qurʾān are from Kurani Tukufu (Aḥmadi). The com-
plete Qurani Takatifu was first published in 1969. In Sikumkana Yesu Bali Mtume 
Paulo, Kanoni refers to becoming a Muslim in 1968. It is possible that Kwanini 
niliacha Ukristo na Nikawa Muislamu was written before the publication of 
Qurani Takatifu and that the Aḥmadi translation was the only one available to 
him. The quotes from the Bible are from Biblia Union Version.
On several occasions a comparison of Swahili translations of the Bible 
dated 1945 and 1950 is made, using the Gospels of John and Matthew and the

Epistle of Jude. The 1945 version texts cited accord with earlier versions of the 
Zanzibar Swahili translation, and the 1950 version is the same as the Swahili 
Union Version. It seems unlikely that Kanoni would have been familiar with 
any of the Swahili Bibles produced by Roman Catholics. One reason for this 
is that Kanoni attended school during the 1950s, before the Second Vatican 
Council (1963–5), which encouraged the reading of the Bible by laity and 
promulgated the use of vernacular languages in worship. Another factor is that 
even though Kanoni attended a Roman Catholic Junior Seminary (Secondary 
School) in Tabora Region, none of the Swahili versions of the Bible were pub-
lished at Kipalapala until 1967, well after Kanoni left school. Kipalapala is the 
Benedictine Priory in Tabora, where Tanganyika Mission Press is based.

Chapter 9
The approach is generally polemical, with a self-defensive attitude as to why 
he chose to become a Muslim.
Kila mtu atakaye kisoma kitabu hiki ataona kuamua kwangu kuiacha 
dini ya Kikristo hakukufanywa kwa sababu ya tamaa fulani, bali kulifan-
ywa kwa sababu ya ukweli ambao tumekwisha kuuona.
Each person who reads this book will see that my decision to leave the 
religion of Christianity was not done because of some ambition, rather it 
was done because of the truth that we have already seen.

He shows a high regard for the scriptures and for Jesus in particular.
Kanoni uses passages from the Old and New Testaments in order to explain 
why he left Christianity and became a Muslim.
Kanoni, accuses Christians of taḥrīf (corruption) of scripture. Three differ-
ent New Testament verses are used in this accusation; John 1:18 appears twice.
“JE, KUITWA YESU ‘MWANA’ KUNA MAANA GANI?”
Nilipokuwa nikihojiana na mkuu fulani wa dini ya Kikristo juu ya nafsi 
ya pili ya Mungu, yaani Yesu, Mkuu huyu alinionyesha sehemu fulani 
katika Biblia palipokuwa pameandikwa “Mungu Mwana”. Na kutokana 
na ushahidi huu Wakristo wote wanaamini kwamba Yesu ni Mungu 
Mwana akiwa ni nafsi ya pili ya Mungu.
Kusema kweli neno hili “Mungu-Mwana” kama lilivyoonyeshwa katika 
Biblia ni neno la bandia lililo pachikwa tu katika Biblia. Neno hili lime-
pachikwa makusudi ili ile nia yao ya kumpandisha Yesu iweze kufaulu. 
Neno hili “Mungu-Mwana” halikuwemo katika Biblia za zamani, neno 
hili limeongezwa tu katika Biblia za siku hizi.

“WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CALL JESUS ‘SON’?”
When I was discussing with a certain leader of the Christian religion 
concerning the second person of the Godhead, that is Jesus, that leader 
showed me a certain part in the Bible where it was written “God-Son”. 
And resulting from this testimony all Christians believe that Jesus is 
God’s Son and that he is the second person of the Godhead.
To tell the truth this word “God-Son” as it is shown in the Bible is a 
counterfeit word that is inserted only in the Bible. This word is inserted 
on purpose in order that that desire of theirs to raise up Jesus should 
succeed. This word “God-Son” was not in the old Bible, this word was only 
added in the Bible of these days.
In the Bible that was printed in 1945
John 1:18 is written:-
“The only son that is in the Father’s breast.”
But in the Bible that was printed in 1950
John 1:18 is written:-
“God the only Son that is in the Father’s breast.”
I think that you will see that the old Bible does not know this word 
“God-Son” rather it only knows the word “Son”. When in this time of light 
when many of the people are aware, these writers are able to dare to 
change the Bible and to write words that are able to mislead their fol-
lowers, so, how many changes that are greater than this were able to be 
changed by these writers in the time of darkness? No doubt today’s Bible 
is filled with many things that are not the truth which were able to be 
added according to the inclination of those writers.
That way, this word “God-Son” is not the word of truth, rather it is a 
“counterfeit” word. It was only added so that they could dare to make the 
lie of their faith that has no foundation, that of the Holy Trinity.

Chapter 9
The passage begins by asking what it means to call Jesus ‘Son’. The tract uses 
the different words found in two versions of the Swahili Bible. The first version 
that Kanoni calls the Bible of 1945, uses ‘Son’, this is Kitabu cha Agano Jipya la 
Bwana na Mwokozi Wetu Yesu Kristo Kimefasirika katika Maneno ya Kiyunani 
(New Testament in Swahili (Zanzibar)) (Book of the New Testament of Our Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Christ which is translated from the Greek Text in Zanzibar 
Swahili) which had been reprinted from an edition which had last been cor-
rected in 1923 (Peltola, 1957: 24). Edward Steere’s version was first published 
in 1879, with revisions in 1883; this was further revised by Arthur Madan and 
Percy Jones-Bateman, and printed in 1892 by BFBS. With further revisions by 
Jones-Bateman, Herbert Woodward, assisted by Petro Limo and Cecil Majiliwa, 
it was printed in Zanzibar in 1893. A final revision was undertaken by Frank 
Weston and Godfrey Dale and published in 1921, according to Kalugila and 
Mojola, whilst Peltola says 1923 (Kalugila, 1997: 15–24; Mojola, 1999: 66–7; 
Peltola, 1957: 23–4).

The second version, which he calls the Bible of 1950, includes ‘God’; this 
is Kitabu cha Agano Jipya la Bwana na Mwokozi Wetu Yesu Kristo (The New 
Testament in Swahili Union Version) (Book of the New Testament of Our Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Christ, Swahili Union Version) which was the first edition 
of the new Union Version. This had been a co-operative effort encouraged by 
the BFBS. The work was carried out by missionaries from UMCA, who used 
Zanzibar Swahili, and CMS, who used Mombasa Swahili, to produce a version 
of the Bible in Standard Swahili, with support from Richard Reusch (Lutheran) 
(Mojola, 1999: 70). Work had begun in the early 1930s with the Gospel of 
Luke: work done by Godfrey Dale (UMCA), corrected by Alfred Pittway and 
H.J. Butcher (CMS), being assessed by G.W. Broomfield (UMCA) and printed 
in 1934 (Kalugila, 1997: 29). Tentative versions of the other Gospels were pub-
lished by CMS in 1945 and the whole New Testament in 1950 (Mojola, 1999: 70).
Kanoni would have been at school in 1950 and it is possible that he was pre-
sented with the new version while he was there. Whereas, his father-in-law, as 
an Anglican priest in Muheza, almost certainly would have had a copy of the 
New Testament in Zanzibar Swahili (1945).
It is perhaps it is to be expected that Kanoni was surprised at the differ-
ences between the two versions of the passage, as the reason for the differ-
ence between the two versions originates in variant readings in the text of the 
Greek New Testament, something that it is unlikely that a layperson would be 
aware of.
The current Greek New Testament (GNT 5th Edition, 2019) reads:
monogenēs theos ho ōn eis ton kolpon tou patros
(the only one of God that is in the breast of the father)
The first two words, monogenēs (unique: adjective, nominative masculine sin-
gular) and Theos (God: noun nominative masculine singular) are the ones in 
contention. The apparatus of the The Greek New Testament (5th edition 2019) 
(GNT) shows a variant reading, ho monogenēs uios, uios (son, heir, offspring: 
noun nominative masculine singular); it also lists which manuscripts give each 
of the readings. The GNT has an extensive apparatus, in the form of footnotes 
which show variant readings found in different manuscripts. Bruce Metzger 
describes the procedures of the committee, which weighed the evidence of the 
manuscripts, and a majority chose one version, and the minority view is also 
given (Metzger, 1975: 198).
From 1898, the various editions of the Greek New Testament compiled by 
Eberhard Nestle were based on a comparison of the available manuscripts and

other printed editions. The decision to change from uios (son) to theos (God) in 
the text only came after the editorial committee of the United Bible Societies 
included additional early papyri versions of the gospels when they were mak-
ing decisions for the new edition. Papyri refers to early texts that were written 
on papyrus (a paper made from the pith of the papyrus plant), rather than on 
parchment. The papyri are often fragments of text which are identified by 𝔓 
followed by a superscript number. The papyri are: 𝔓66 which is dated around 
200, copies are found in Cologny, Switzerland, Cologne, Germany and Dublin, 
a fragment which includes John 1:1–6:11, and 𝔓75 which is dated early third cen-
tury, the only copy is in Cologny, a fragment which includes John 1:1–11:45. Both 
of which have theos (God) rather than uios (son) (Metzger, 1975: 198). These 
papyri were not published in critical editions until 1956 (𝔓66) 1976 (𝔓75) so 
they will not have affected decisions on the Swahili versions (Aland and Aland 
1987: 100–1). The earlier readings were considered as stronger by a majority of 
the committee, who regarded the change from theos (God) to uios (son) to be 
the result of scribal assimilation (Metzger, 1975: 198). In his commentary on 
John, G. Beasley-Murray argues that either reading fits with Johannine theol-
ogy and could be possible (Beasley-Murray, 1999: 2).
This explanation has been given to demonstrate that there are differ-
ent readings of the verse, which centre on the presence or absence of ‘Son’. 
The Zanzibar Swahili version says Mwana wa pekee (the only son) whilst the 
Union Version says Mungu Mwana pekee (God the only son). When these ver-
sions were being prepared, those who were translating more often relied on 
English versions of the New Testament, rather than using the Greek version 
as a basis. The King James Version (1611) of the Bible was the only one avail-
able in English when Edward Steere was working; the key phrase says ‘Only 
begotten Son’. However, in the 1940s those working on the Union Version would 
have had access to the Revised Version (1885) and early drafts of the Revised 
Standard Version (published 1946), which says ‘the only Son’, with a footnote 
saying ‘Other ancient authorities read God’, whilst the later New Revised 
Standard Version (1989) has ‘God the only Son’, with a footnote saying ‘Other 
ancient authorities read It is an only Son, God, or It is the only Son’. Those who 
worked on the Zanzibar Swahili version could possibly have used Constantin 
von Tischendorf’s Editio octava critica maior (1869–72), but they had published 
the first Swahili edition before New Testament in Original Greek by Brooke 
Westcott and Fenton Hort was published in 1881. The 13th Edition of Novum 
Testamentum Graece by Erwin Nestle was published in 1927 and would have 
been available to those working on the Union Version. This edition would have 
shown theos (God) as an alternative reading supported by a number of early 
manuscripts (See Aland and Aland, 1987: 18–20).

Because the variant reading was known, those working on John’s Gospel 
would have discussed the possibility of using Mungu Mwana pekee rather than 
Mwana wa pekee. It is not surprising that Kanoni, finding these two differ-
ent versions, says: ‘This word is inserted on purpose’, that is taḥrīf (deliberate 
corruption).
Kanoni gives two reasons as to why the change was made:
… in order that that desire of theirs to raise up Jesus should succeed.
It was only added so that they could dare to make the lie of their faith 
that has no foundation, that of the Holy Trinity.
Kanoni: 22
The passage asks the meaning of Mungu Mwana: it can be translated as ‘God 
the Son’ as there is no possessive wa (of) to make it God’s Son.
Kanoni uses this variation to raise the possibility that many other changes 
could have been deliberately and perniciously made in the past during the 
‘wakati wa giza’ (time of darkness). This could possibly reflect the ideas of 
a period of jahiliyya (ignorance) that Sayyid Quṭb wrote about in Maʿālim fi 
ʿl-Ṭariq (Milestones) (Quṭb, 1990), as Quṭb’s ideas were being made known in 
Tanzania during the 1960s (Chande 1998: 144).
In a later section, the tract specifically places a charge of taḥrif, that the 
Bible is continuously being changed. Three New Testament verses are used: 
Jude 1:14, Matthew 10:23 and John 1:18 is again examined.
BIBLIA KUBADILISHWA MANENO YAKE KILA MWAKA
Kuna ushahidi pia kwamba Biblia ni kitabu kinachobadilishwa badil-
ishwa kila mwaka. Maandishi yake ni maandishi yanayofanyiwa mabada-
liko “amendments”. Ushahidi ufuatao unaweza kuthubutisha jambo 
hili:-
Injili ya mwaka wa 1945: Yuda 1:14 Imeandikwa:-
“Na Enok, wa saba baada ya Adam, alitoa maneno ya unabii juu ya hao, 
akisema, Angalia, Bwana alikuja na elfu kumi za watakatifu wake.”
Maneno haya yanataja juu ya “elfu kumi za Watakatifu.”
Injili ya mwaka 1950: Yuda 1:14 Imeandikwa:-
“Na Henoko, mtu was aba baada ya Adamu, alitoa maneno ya Unabii 
juu ya hao, akisema, Angalia, Bwana alikuja na watakatifu wake maelfu 
maelfu.”
Katika maneno haya imeandikwa “maelfu maelfu”, yaani wasio na 
idadi. Lakini Injili ya Kiingereza inasema “ten thousand of Saints.”
Katika Biblia ya 1945 neno “elfu kumi” limo; lakini Biblia ya mwaka 
1950 neno hili limeondolewa, na badala yake limeingizwa neno jingine

nalo ni “maelfu maelfu”. Je, ni nani aliyekuwa amewapa habari waan-
dishi hawa kwamba neno “elfu kumi” lilikuwa ni neno lisilofaa na neno 
“maelfu maelfu” lilikuwa ndilo neno sahihi?
Hali kadhalika, Injili ya mwaka 1945: Mathayo 10:23:-
“Hamtaimaliza miji yote ya Israeli hata ajapo Mwana wa Adamu.”
Lakini katika Injili ya mwaka 1950 neno hili “Yote” limeondolewa, 
kwani imeandikwa:-
MATHAYO 10:23 Imeandikwa:-
“Hamtaimaliza miji ya Israeli hata ajapo Mwana wa Adamu.”
Ili wapate ushahidi wakumpandishaYesu kidogo kidogo na kufaulu 
kumpa daraja la Kimungu, wameweza kufanya mabadaliko yafuatayo 
katika Biblia:
Injili ya mwaka 1945: YOHANA 1:18 Imeandikwa:-
“Mwana wa pekee aliyekatika kifua cha Baba.”
Lakini katika Injili ya mwaka 1950 neno jipya limeongezwa nalo ni 
“Mungu”. Neno hili limeongezwa ili uweze kupatikana ushahidi wakump-
andisha Yesu na kumpatia daraja la Kimungu, kwani imeandikwa:-
YOHANA 1:18 Kwamba:-
“Mungu Mwana pekee aliyekatika kifua cha Baba.”
Sasa iwapo katika wakati huu wa nuru, waandishi hawa wanathubutu 
kufanya ujasiri wa kuyaingilia na kuyabadilisha kwa hiari zao maneno 
wanayosadiki kuwa ni maneno ya Mwenyezi Mungu, je, ilikuwaje katika 
enzi za giza wakati watu walikuwa hawajui chochote? Bila shaka katika 
nyakati hizo ni mengi yaliyobadilishwa ambayo leo watu wanaambiwa 
kuyakubali kuwa ni maneno ya Mwenyezi Mungu.
THE BIBLE HAS ITS WORDS CHANGED EVERY YEAR
There is also testimony that the Bible is a book that is changed contin-
uously each year.
Its writing is writing that undergoes changes “amendments”. The fol-
lowing testimony will demonstrate this matter:-
The Gospel of 1945 in Jude 1:14 it is written:-
“And Enoch, the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied concern-
ing this, saying, See, the Lord came with ten thousand of his holy ones.”
These words mention “ten thousand of his holy ones.”
The Gospel of 1950 in Jude 1:14 it is written:-
“And Enoch, the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied concern-
ing this, saying, ‘See, the Lord came with thousand thousands of his holy 
ones.’”
In these words it says “thousand thousands”, that is without number. 
But the Gospel in English says, “ten thousand of Saints.” In the Bible of 1945

the words “ten thousand” are there; but in the Bible of 1950 these words 
have been removed, and instead of these another has been inserted, that 
is “thousand thousands”. So, who is it that has told these writers that “ten 
thousand” is not suitable and that “thousand thousands” is indeed the 
correct word?
Likewise, the Gospel of 1945: Matthew 10:23:-
“You will not finish all the towns of Israel before the coming of the Son 
of Adam.”
But in the Gospel of 1950 this word “All” is removed, because it is 
written:-
MATTHEW 10:23 It is written:-
“You will not finish the towns of Israel before the coming of the Son 
of Adam.”
So that they get a testimony that will gradually raise up Jesus and suc-
ceed in giving him the rank of Godhood, they were able to make the fol-
lowing changes in the Bible:
The Gospel of 1945: JOHN 1:18 It is written:-
“The only son that is in the Father’s breast.”
But in the Gospel of 1950 a new word is added that is “God”. This word 
is added in order to get testimony to raise Jesus to the rank of Godhood, 
that is why it is written:-
JOHN 1:18 That:-
“God the only Son that is in the Father’s breast.”
Now if at this time of light, these writers are daring to have the audac-
ity to insert and change freely the words that they believe are the words 
of Almighty God, so, how was it in the dominion of darkness of the time 
when people knew nothing? No doubt in those times much was changed 
that today people are told to accept are the words of Almighty God.
Kanoni: 59–60
Kanoni quotes the same two versions of the Bible that he used in the earlier 
section. Now he is specifically charging the translators with continuously mak-
ing ‘amendments’, which word appears in English in the tract. In each verse the 
two versions quoted show a difference in the Swahili.
The first example given is Jude 1:14; the whole verse is quoted. The final 
phrase is the one with different text in Swahili.
Hagiais muriasin autou
(myriads of his holy ones)

Chapter 9
The difference being questioned concerns the meaning of one Greek word 
muriasin (dative feminine plural noun), which has a range of meanings: group 
of ten thousand, myriad; countless thousands (Newman 1971: 119). The 1945 
Zanzibar Swahili says elfu kumi (ten thousand), whilst the 1950 UV Swahili says 
maelfu (thousand thousands). The other Swahili Bibles all agree with the UV 
with variations on maelfu or maelfu wa maelfu.
Having noted the difference, Kanoni then looked at the passage in English, 
which he quotes in English: ‘ten thousand of Saints’; he has used the King James 
Version (KJV) of the Bible, which seems to support his argument. Kanoni was 
at school in the 1940s and early 1950s and could have used the KJV in English. 
The RSV was published during this period, but was not readily available in East 
Africa. However, the text of the KJV is misquoted in the tract as an ‘s’ is omit-
ted: the KJV actually reads: ‘ten thousands of saints’, which is closer to the UV 
Swahili version, which he attacks, than the Zanzibar Swahili version, which he 
appears to take as the normative version.
The tract then questions who has the authority to tell the translators of the 
new version of the Swahili Bible to make such changes? This is then supported 
by additional examples, beginning with Matthew 10:23.
Hamtaimaliza miji yote ya Israeli [NTZS] 1945
Hamtaimaliza miji ya Israeli [NTUV] 1950
you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel [NRSV]
(ou mē telesēte tas poleis tou Israēl)
(you shall certainly not come to an end of the towns of Israel)
The change that is questioned is the absence of yote (all) in the UV. The Greek 
word telesēte (aorist subjunctive 2nd person plural: to complete, to come to 
the end) allows for the inclusion of yote in that it has the sense of comple-
tion. Likewise, the omission of yote does not change the sense of the phrase 
in Swahili.
It appears that Kanoni has chosen the example because he found a differ-
ence, without considering whether it makes any difference to the meaning of 
the text. Both Habari Njema and Neno include yote, whereas Roehl omits it.
Introducing the final example, Kanoni then gives the reason for questioning 
the changes.
So that they get a testimony that will gradually raise up Jesus and succeed 
in giving him the rank of Godhood, they were able to make the following 
changes in the Bible.

Then John 1:18 is presented and the insertion of Mungu (God) is again ques-
tioned. Kanoni explains what he believes is the reason why the translators 
have done it:
This word is added in order that there is testimony to raise Jesus to the 
rank of Godhood.
Kanoni uses the verse to add to the ‘evidence’, without the detailed argument 
that he set out in the earlier section.
He completes this section by contrasting the present, wakati huu wa nuru 
(this time of light), with the past, enzi za giza (dominion of darkness). He won-
ders at the audacity and daring of the translators to make such changes and 
asks, if they can do this when we live in the light, how many more corruptions 
were made in the past?
In his arguments, Kanoni does not appear to be referring to the classical 
attacks on Christians for taḥrīf; his argument seems to be based on the differ-
ences between two versions of the Swahili Bible. The resulting attack is not dis-
similar and appears to be rooted in the different understanding of the text of 
the Qurʾān and the Bible by Muslims and Christians. For Muslims, the Qurʾān 
is the true text only in the original Arabic and anything in a different language 
can only be an interpretation of the text and not the text itself. Whereas, for 
Christians, the Bible is the Word of God, in whatever language it is read in. 
The New Testament was written originally in Greek, but has been translated 
into the languages (vernaculars) of the people using it from the time of the 
early church. A Syriac document, the Diatessaron, which is a harmony of the 
gospels, came into use by the end of the second century, and various Latin 
versions during the third century (Aland and Aland, 1987: 182–9). The use of 
the vernacular form from at least the second century was so that the believers 
could understand it clearly.

Njia ya Uzima also lists an English version, In Search of Assurance, 
32 pages
The tract is published by Njia ya Uzima (Way of Life), which also published 
one of the other tracts being examined, Hapana! Dini ya Kristo Haijabatilishwa. 
Njia ya Uzima is an organisation, which began in 1987, linked to Call of Hope. 
It was started by Rudi Hofmeister, a German based in Nairobi, working with 
several Kenyans. From 1992, it had a branch in Arusha, run by Fred Mleli, a 
Tanzanian, originally from a Muslim family, who worked as an Evangelist in 
Dar es Salaam with the Lutheran Church during the 1960s. Njia ya Uzima oper-
ates a correspondence course, where correspondents answer a set of questions 
at the back of the tract, sending the answers off in order to receive another 
tract. It also runs seminars to train church workers (Eric, 1998: 27–8). The mate-
rial used is translated from German and English and comes from Call of Hope, 
based in Stuttgart, Germany; the Good Way, based in Rikon, Switzerland; or 
from Light of Life, based in Villach, Austria. These European groups produce a 
lot of material, including reprints of Karl Pfander’s Mīzān ul-Ḥaqq: The Balance 
of Truth (Light of Life, 1986), as well as the many tracts used for the correspond-
ence courses. Some of the material can be considered as polemical and even 
offensive.
K.K. Alavi was born in 1951 in Cherukunnu, in Kerala State, India. He 
describes his father as being a mulla (religious teacher). From the age of five 
he had attended the madrasa and learnt Arabic. The tract is his testimony; in 
it he relates his spiritual journey from the time when, as a child, he bought a 
Christian tract, The Heart of Pak. Alavi relates that he was forced by his father 
to burn The Heart of Pak as a child after his father discovered that he had been 
attending a Christian Sunday School (Alavi: 11).
The Heart of Pak is an illustrated tract, 24 pages long, that tells the story of a 
conversation between a Korean boy and a missionary, and how Pak is taught 
to trust in Jesus. The English version was written by May Sundell Brown and 
appears to have been first published in 1960.
Alavi relates his life up to when he became a Christian in 1970, whilst attend-
ing a Bible course at Concordia Seminary, Nagercoil, then working for Operation

Mobilisation and studying Theology at Concordia Seminary, St Louis, Missouri, 
where he completed his studies in 1975. The tract ends with twenty questions 
for the reader to complete and send to Njia ya Uzima, to receive a further tract.
The quotations from the Qurʾān are also given in Arabic; the Swahili gener-
ally follows Qurani Takatifu by al-Farsy. The quotations from the Bible follow 
Biblia Union Version.
The tract is generally eirenic in tone whilst demonstrating why the author 
left Islam.
Alavi quotes most of ([Al-Nisāʾ] 4:171) using it to emphasise the attributes 
of Jesus.
Pia Kurani inampa Yesu sifa fulani ambazo ni tofauti na zile ambazo 
wamepewa manabii wengine au mitume. Yesu ameelezwa kuwa ni Neno 
la Mungu na roho iliyotoka kwa Mungu:
“Enyi watu wa Kitabu! Msipindukie mipaka katika dini yenu, wala 
msiseme juu ya Mwenyezi Mungu ila yaliyo kweli. Masihi Isa bin 
Maryamu ni Mtume wa Mwenyezi Mungu na tamko lake alilompele-
kea Maryamu. Na ni roho iliyotoka Kwake. Basi mwamini ni Mwenyezi

Chapter 9
Mungu na Mitume yake; wala msiseme ‘watatu …’ Jizueni; itakuwa bora 
kwenu. Bila shaka Mwenyezi Mungu ni Mungu mmoja tu …” (4:171).
	
Kadhalika, malaika Jibr’ail (au Gabrieli) alimwambia Mariamu 
kwamba:
“… akasema: Ni kama hivyo Mola wako amesema: Haya ni sahali 
Kwangu, na ili Tumfanye Muujiza kwa wanadamu na rehema itokayo 
kwetu; na hili ni jambo lililokwisha hukumiwa” (19:21 ling. 21:91).
Kila jambo ambalo Kurani inanena juu ya Yesu huonyesha kwamba 
Yesu ni mtu tofauti: Uhusiano wake na Mungu kama Neno la Mungu na 
roho iliyotoka kwa Mungu; kazi zake za ajabu; jinsi alivyokuwa akiponya 
watu; jinsi alvyowafufua wafu (3:49); alivyopaa kwenda mbinguni hadi 
leo.
Also the Qurʾān gives Jesus certain praise that is different from that given 
to other prophets or apostles. Jesus is explained as being the Word of God 
and the spirit that comes from God:
“Oh people of the Book! Do not overturn the limits of your religion, 
nor should you say of Almighty God other than that which is true. The 
Messiah Jesus son of Mary is a Messenger of Almighty God and his proc-
lamation [word] that he brought Mary. And he is a spirit that came from 
Him. So believe in Almighty God and his Apostles; nor should you say 
‘three …’ Restrain yourself; it will be better for you. No doubt Almighty 
God is only one God …” ([Al-Nisāʾ] 4:171).
Similarly, the Angel Jibrāʾīl (or Gabriel) told Mary that:
“… he said: It is like this your Lord said: That is easy for Me, and to 
make him a Miracle for humans and a mercy from us; and this is a thing 
that has already been determined” ([Maryam]19:21 cf. [Al-Anbiyāʾ] 21:91).
Each thing that the Qurʾān states about Jesus shows that Jesus is a dif-
ferent person: his relationship with God as the Word of God and spirit 
that came from God; his amazing work; how he healed people; how he 
raised them from the dead ([Āl ʿImrān] 3:49); he ascended to heaven until 
today.
ALAVI: 24–5
Alavi makes no attempt to use this passage to explain or to defend the Trinity, 
even though he includes the Qurʾān’s rejection of it. Rather, the passage is used 
to show that the Qurʾān sees Jesus as a different person, because of his relation-
ship with God.
Alavi uses the titles, Word of God and spirit that comes from God, twice. 
In the reference to ‘word’ the Swahili uses ‘tamko’ which is translated as

‘proclamation’; this follows al-Farsy, where it gives the sense of ‘a word’ of God, 
a ‘command’ that was given by God, when Mary conceived Jesus at the com-
mand of God.
Alavi quotes Al-Māʾida [5]:72, 73, whilst relating his testimony, explaining 
his journey from Islam to Christianity.
Kabla sijaonana na marafiki zangu wapya wa Kikristo, nilikuwa nikiwa-
chukia sana Wakristo kwa sababu niliambiwa mambo mabaya juu yao. 
Walakini nilipochunguza tabia ya mmishonari yule, maisha yake, na jinsi 
alivyowafikiria Waislamu, nilijua kwamba mambo yale mabaya niliyokuwa 
nimeyasikia juu ya Wakristo hayakumhusu yeye. Jambo hilo lilinifanya 
nifikirie sana. Je! upendo wake ulikuwa mkubwa kupita ulewa Waislamu? 
Je, Yesu, Masihi wa Mungu, alikuwa amemfanyia mambo mengi kuliko 
yale ambayo nabii wangu alikuwa amenifanyia? Nilichanganyikiwa sana 
kwakuwa nilisadiki kwamba ikiwa mtu si Mwislamu, yeye ni kafir hata 
angekuwa ni Mkristo anayeamini kuwa Mungu ni Masihi. Mtu wa namna 
hiyo amekataliwa na Mungu. Kwa maana Kurani inasema kwamba:

Chapter 9
Bila ya shaka wamekufuru wale waliosema, Mwenyezi Mungu ni 
Masihi, (Isa) bin Maryamu. Na (hali ya kuwa) Masihi alisema: “Enyi wana 
wa Israili! Mwabuduni Mwenyezi Mungu, Mola wangu na Mola wenu. 
Kwani anayemshirikisha Mwenyezi Mungu, hakika Mwenyezi Mungu 
atamharimishia Pepo, na mahali pake (patakuwa) ni Motoni, na madhal-
imu hawatakuwa na wasaidizi.”
	
Kwa hakika wamekufuru wale waliosema: “Mwenyezi Mungu nim-
moja katika (wale waungu) watatu. Hali hakuna mungu ila Mwenyezi 
Mungu mmoja. Na kama hawataacha hayo wayasemayo, kwa yakini 
itawakamata wale wanaoendelea na ukafiri miongoni mwao – adhabu 
iumizayo” (5:72, 73).
Nilitafakari pia jinsi nilivyofikiria kwamba kwa vile nilikuwa Mwislamu 
niliyemnyenyekea Mungu, basi nilikuwa mtakatifu zaidi ya Wakristo. 
Walakini, wakati nilipozidi kujihoji juu ya hali yangu ya uovu, niligundua 
kwamba yule mmishonari ndiye aliyekuwa amejitoa maisha yake kwa 
Mungu. Tabia yake ilithibitisha hivyo. Niliona kwamba upendo wake uli-
toka kwa Yesu Kristo, kama vile kitabu cha “Moyo wa Paku” kilivyoeleza.
Before I had met with my new Christian friends, I had greatly detested 
Christians because I was told bad things concerning them. But when I 
studied the character of that missionary, his life, and how he thought of 
Muslims, I knew that those bad things that I had heard about Christians 
did not concern him. This made me think very hard. Was his love so much 
greater than that of the Muslims? Was Jesus, the Messiah of God, able to 
do so much more for him than that which my prophet was able to do for 
me? I was very confused because I accepted that if a person was not a 
Muslim, he is an infidel even if he is a Christian who believes that God is 
the Messiah. A person of this sort is rejected by God. Because the Qurʾān 
says:
Certainly they have blasphemed who say that Almighty God is the 
Messiah (Jesus) child of Mary. And (when) the Messiah said: “You peo-
ple of Israel! Worship Almighty God your Lord and my Lord. Because he 
that associates anything with Almighty God, certainly Almighty God will 
forbid him Paradise, and his dwelling (will be) in the Fire. And the unjust 
will not have any helpers.”
Certainly, they have blasphemed, those who say: “Almighty God is 
One of (those) three (gods). There is no God except the One Almighty 
God. And if they do not cease what they are saying, certainly it will seize 
them – those that continue with their blaspheming amongst them – a 
punishment will fall down upon them” ([Al-Māʾida] 5:72, 73).

I also pondered as to how I thought that because I was a Muslim I was 
respectful to God, so I was more holy than Christians. But, the time that I 
continued to consider my evil state, I discovered that that missionary had 
indeed given his life for God. His character showed this. I saw that his love 
came from Jesus Christ, as the book “The Heart of Pak” explained. 
Alavi: 12–14
Alavi relates how his previous opinion of Christians has been challenged 
through the witness of an un-named Christian missionary. He makes clear his 
former understanding, calling Christians kafir (infidel). He uses the verses to 
show the Qurʾānic teaching condemning shirk (associating partners with God) 
and what will happen to Christians as a result of being guilty of it.
Alavi is clearly impressed at the witness and life of the Christian missionary, 
likening it to the teaching in a tract he bought as a young child, The Heart of 
Pak.
Alavi quotes Al-Māʾida (5):117 together with Āl ʿImrān (3):55 so as to differen-
tiate between the meaning of two phrases.
(Kumbukeni) Mwenyezi Mungu aliposema: Ewe Isa! Mimi nitakutimi-
zia muda wako wa kuishi. Na nitakuleta kwangu, na nitakutakasa na 
wale waliokufuru, mpaka siku ya Kiyama. Kisha marejeo yenu yatakuwa 
kwangu, nikihukumu ni katika yale mliyokuwa mkikhitalifiana (3:55).
Sikuwaambia lo lote ila yale uliyoniamrisha: ya kwamba “Mwabuduni 
Mwenyezi Mungu, Mola wangu na Mola wenu.” Na nilikuwa shahidi juu 
yao nilipokuwa nao; na uliponikamilisha muda wangu, Wewe ukawa 
mchungaji juu yao, na Wewe shahidi juu ya kila kitu. (5:117)
Je! tafsiri ya Picktall ya Mutawaffika (“Mimi nitakutimizia” 3:55) na 
tawaffaitani (“na uliponikamilisha muda wangu” 5:117) nisawa? Baadhi ya 
vitabu vya Kiislamu vya ufafanuzi ambavyo vinaheshimiwa, hutafsiri hivi 
maneno hayo: “nitakusababisha kufa” ili kutuonyesha kuwa kifo cha Yesu 
kilifuatiwa na kupaa kwake kwenda mbinguni.
Katika kila tukio, maelezo ya Biblia hayatoi nafasi kwa watu kutafsiri 
njia mbali mbali juu ya wakati, mahali, na mambo yaliyosababisha kifo 
cha Yesu. Yesu alisulubiwa, akafa, na akazikwa. Kusulubiwa kwake kuli-
fanyika nje ya kuta za Yerusalemu. Kulifanyika wakati Pilato alipokuwa 
liwali wa Uyahudi. Mambo hayo ni ukweli wa historia. Biblia hueleza 
habari za kifo cha Yesu katika lugha inayoeleweka, isiyo na mafumbo. 
Biblia huonyesha wazi jinsi Yesu alivyokufa, akafufuka na akapaa mbin-
guni. Huonyesha makusudi ya matukio hayo muhimu katika maisha yake.

Chapter 9
(Remember) When Almighty God said: Oh ʿĪsā! I will complete your time 
for living. And I will bring you to me, and I will sanctify you from those 
who blaspheme, until the day of Judgement. Then your return will be to 
me, I will judge between you in the matters in which you dispute ([Āl 
ʿImrān] 3:55).
I did not tell them anything other than what you commanded me: 
that “Worship Almighty God, my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a wit-
ness concerning them when I was with them; and when you completed 
my time, You became their pastor, and You are a witness concerning 
everything ([Al-Māʾida] 5:117).
Are Pickthall’s translation of Mutawaffīka (“I will complete for you” 
[Āl ʿImrān] 3:55) and tawaffaytanī (“and when you completed my time” 
[Al-Māʾida] 5:117) the same? Some of the respected books of Islamic exe-
gesis explain these words like this: “I will cause you to die” so as to show 
us that the death of Jesus was followed by his ascension to heaven.
In each case, the explanations of the Bible do not give people the 
opportunity to interpret in different ways, concerning the time, place, 
and matters that caused the death of Jesus. Jesus was crucified, he died, 
and was buried. His crucifixion was done outside the walls of Jerusalem. 
It was done at the time that Pilate was the administrator of Judea. These 
things are the truth of history. The Bible relates the death of Jesus in clear 
language, without hidden meanings. The Bible shows openly how Jesus 
died, rose from the death and ascended to heaven. This shows the pur-
pose of the important events in his life.
Alavi: 27–8
Alavi questions whether Pickthall’s interpretation of a phrase in the two verses 
gives the same meaning. The transliteration of mutawaffīka and tawaffaytanī 
follows Neal Robinson in his chapter ‘The Meaning of the Verb tawaffāʾ’ (1991: 
117–26). It is possible that the translator of the tract has not fully understood 
that the root word in Arabic is the same in both instances. The Swahili ver-
sion used follows al-Farsy who uses nitakutimizia (I will complete for you), 
ni- I, -ta- indicates Future tense, -ku- object prefix: you, -timiza – to complete, 
the ending -zia indicates that the Verb is in the Prepositional (Applied) form, 
in Āl ʿImrān (3):55; and uliponikamilisha (when you completed me), u- you, 
-li- indicates Past tense, -po- Relative infix, for time or place, -n­i- object pre-
fix: me, -kamili – to complete, the ending -sha indicates that the Verb is in the 
Causative form. In English these can both give the sense of completion, but are 
quite different words in Swahili.
Alavi explains that some Islamic tafsīr of these passages give an interpre-
tation meaning that God will ‘cause Jesus’s death’, once he had ascended to 
heaven. He uses this to contrast with the Bible, stating that it is not possible to

give different interpretations of explanations given in the Bible. Specifically, he 
relates this to the accounts of Jesus’s crucifixion, death and burial. In this, Alavi 
appears not to acknowledge the wide range of exegetical comments concern-
ing these events. He is wishing to defend the truths of the Bible, as he under-
stands them, against the refutations found in the Qurʾān.
This tract quotes Āl ʿĪmrān (3):45–50 twice. In the first case, after an intro-
ductory paragraph, verses 45–50 are given in full; they are then followed by a 
brief comment showing the writer’s realisation of the importance of the Torah 
and Injīl.
Niligundua kwamba Isa ana sehemu muhimu sana katika Kurani na pia 
katika Hadithi au desturi za Kiislamu. Niliona katika Kurani kwamba Isa 
ni wa muhimu sana kuliko mtume wangu Muhammad. Haukupita muda 
mrefu, mara yule mwalimu pamoja na wazazi wangu wakawa na mashaka 
kuhusu nilivyotamani kujifunza zaidi habari za Isa. Walinishauri kwamba 
nisisitize kujifunza juu ya Muhammad. Nilizidi kushangazwa na aya za 
Kurani zilizokuwa zikinena habari za Yesu, kuhusu kuzaliwa kwake kwa 
ajabu, na kazi zake za ajabu.
“(Kumbukeni) waliposema Malaika: ‘Ewe Maryamu! Mwenyezi Mungu 
anakupa khabari njema za neno tu litokalo kwake. Jina lake ni Masih, Isa, 
mwana wa Maryamu, mwenye hishima katika dunia na Akhera, na mion-
goni mwa waliopelekwa mbele na Mwenyezi Mungu (Allah).
Naye atazungumza na watu katika utoto wake na katika utu uzima 
wake, na (atakuwa) katika watu wema kabisa.’
Maryamu akasema: Mola wangu! Nitapataje mtoto, na hali mtu yo yote 
hakunigusa? Akasema: Ndivyo vivyo hivyo; Mwenyezi Mungu huumba 
anavyopenda: anapohukumu jambo huliambia ‘Kuwa’, likawa.
Na (Mwenyezi Mungu) atafunza kuandika na kujua ilimu na Taurati 
na Injili.
Na (atamfanya) Mtume kwa wana wa Israili, (kuwaambia): 
“Nimekujieni na hoja kutoka kwa Mola wenu, ya kwamba nakuumbieni, 
katika udongo, kama sura ya ndege, kisha nampuliza, mara anakuwa 
ndege, kwa idhini ya Mwenyezi Mungu. Na ninawaponesha vipofu na 
wenye mabalanga, na ninawafufua (baadhi ya) waliokufa, kwa idhini ya 
Mwenyezi Mungu, na nitakwambieni mtakavyovila na mtakavyoweka 
akiba katika nyumba zenu. Bila shaka katika haya imo hoja kwenu ikiwa 
nyinyi ni watu wa kuamini!
Na (nitakuwa) msadikishaji wa yale yaliyokuwa kabla yangu katika 
Taurati; na (nimekuja) ili nikuhalalishieni baadhi ya yale mliyoha-
rimishiwa, na nimekujieni na hoja kutoka kwa Mola wenu. Kwa hivyo 
mcheni Mwenyezi Mungu na nitiini” (3:45–50).

Chapter 9
Pia niligundua kwamba Kurani hutaja mambo hasa ya Agano la Kale, 
yaani Taurati na pia mambo ya Agano Jipya, yaani Injili. Jambo hilo lilin-
ifanya nisadiki maagano hayo kwa sababu ni mwongozo na nuru (5:46).
I discovered that ʿĪsā has a very important part in the Qurʾān and also 
in the Ḥadīth, or the traditions of Islam. I saw in the Qurʾān that ʿĪsā is 
of the utmost importance above my apostle Muḥammad. Not very long 
had passed, suddenly that teacher together with my parents had worries 
about the way I desired to learn more about Jesus. They advised me that 
I should concentrate on learning about Muḥammad. I continued to be 
astonished at the verses of the Qurʾān that talked of Jesus, concerning his 
amazing birth and his amazing work.
“(Remember) when the Angels said: ‘Oh Mary! Almighty God gives you 
good news of a word only that comes from him. His name is the Messiah, 
ʿĪsā, Son of Mary, one who is respected on earth and the hereafter and 
among those who were brought before Almighty God (Allāh).
And he will talk to the people during his childhood and when he 
becomes an adult, and (he will be) among the good people.’”
Mary said: “My Lord! How will I get a child when no-one has ever 
touched me?” He said: Indeed it will be like this; Almighty God creates as 
he desires; when he decrees something, he says ‘Be’, [and] it is.
And (Almighty God) will teach to write and to know knowledge and of 
the Torah and Gospel.
And (he will make him) an Apostle to the children of Israel (to tell 
them): “I have come to you with a concern from your God, that I create for 
you the form of a bird from clay, afterwards I breathed on it and straight 
away it becomes a bird, by the consent of Almighty God. And I heal the 
blind and those with skin disease, and I raise (some of) those who have 
died, by the consent of Almighty God, and I will tell you what you will eat 
and what you will store in your houses. Without doubt there is a sign for 
you if you are believing people!
And (I will be) a trustworthy witness for those matters which were 
before me in the Torah; and (I have come) so that I might legitimize some 
of that which was forbidden you, and I have come to you with signs from 
your God. Therefore fear Almighty God and obey me” ([Āl ʿĪmrān] 3:45–50).
Also I discovered that the Qurʾān especially mentions things from the 
Old Testament, that is the Torah and also things from the New Testament, 
that is the Injīl. This circumstance made me accept these testaments 
because they are a guide and light. ([Al-Māʾida] 5:46).

Alavi uses this verse to illustrate his growing realisation of how often Jesus 
is found in the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth. He makes a comparison between Jesus and 
his apostle Muḥammad, revealing his doubts to his parents and to his teacher, 
who told him to concentrate on learning about Muḥammad. He quotes the 
verses to show Jesus’s ‘amazing birth and his amazing work’. He concludes by 
commenting that he had discovered that the Qurʾān referred to things also 
found in the Old Testament and the New Testament, which led him to accept 
the testaments as a ‘guide and light’.
The approach by Alavi is to use verses from the Qurʾān to speak for him, to 
show that Jesus is different and that his readers should look at the Qurʾān and 
make a similar discovery.
Alavi quotes a part of the passage ([Al-Nisāʾ] 4:157–9).
Yamkini, kufuatana na Surat An-Nisaa, Waislamu wanakataa ukweli wa 
Biblia kuhusu kifo cha Yesu, kufufuka kwake na kupaakwake:
“Na kwa kusema kwao: ‘Sisi tumemwua Masihi Isa, mwana wa 
Maryamu Mtume wa Mungu,’ hali hawakumwua wala hawakumsu-
lubu, bali walibabaishiwa. Na kwa hakika wale walio khitalifiana katika 
hiyo wamo katika shaka nalo. Wao hawana yakini juu ya hili, isipokuwa 
wanafuata dhana tu. Na kwa yakini hawakumwua….” (4:157–9)
Possibly, following Sūra Al-Nisāʾ, Muslims deny the truth of the Bible con-
cerning the death of Jesus, his resurrection and his ascension:
“And they say: ‘We killed the Messiah ʿĪsā, son of Mary, Apostle of 
God,’ when they neither killed him nor crucified him, rather they were 
confused. And certainly those who are confused in this are together with 
doubts. They have no certainty about this, except they follow only a sur-
mise. And for certain they did not kill him….” ([Al-Nisāʾ] 4:157–9) 
Alavi: 26
The verses are used to explain why Muslims deny the crucifixion, whilst stating 
that the Bible gives the true account of what happened. Alavi examines the 
verses in conjunction with Al-Ṣaff (61):6, using them to show the importance 
of this passage in his own personal journey of faith.
Hata hivyo, swali hili lilinisumbua sana mawazo yangu. Je! vipi kuhusu 
Muhammad ambaye Kurani inadai kwamba kuja kwake kulitabiriwa na 
Yesu?

Chapter 9
“Na aliposema Isa bin Mariamu: Enyi wana wa Israili! Mimi ni Mtume 
wa Mwenyezi Mungu kwenu, nisadikishaye yaliyokuwa kabla yangu 
katika Taurati, nikutoa habari njema ya Mtume atakaye jia nyuma yangu 
ambaye jina lake litakuwa Ahmad (yaani Mwenye kushukuriwa). Lakini 
alipowajia kwa hoja zilizowazi, walisema: Huu ni udanganyifu uliyodha-
hiri” (61:6).
Neno la Kiarabu la “Mwenye Kushukuriwa” ni Ahmad, ambalo lin-
amaana sawa na Muhammad. Je! Maandiko haya hayana maana kuwa 
Yesu alinena habari za kuja kwa Muhammad? Hivyo ndivyo nilivyokuwa 
nimefundishwa, tena nikaamini hivyo.
Nilichunguza Biblia ili nione jinsi ilivyokuwa ikisema juu ya 
Muhammad, lakini sikuona kitu. Niliwauliza waalimu wangu nao 
wakasema kwamba hakuna jambo hilo. Wakati niliposoma kitabu cha 
Kiislamu kilicho na maelezo au tafsiriya Kurani, niliona kwamba wame-
nukulu aya fulani za Biblia ambazo zina husiana na sura hiyo ya 61:6. Aya 
ambayo ilinukuliwa ni,
“Nami nitamwomba Baba, naye atawapa Msaidizi mwingine ili akae 
nanyi hata milele” (Yohana 14:16)
Neno la Kiyunani kuhusu Msaidizi ni “Parakletos”. (Vitabu vya Injili 
viliandikwa katika lugha ya Kiyunani.) Yule mfafanuzi alisema kwamba 
neno la asilia lilikuwa ni Perikultos [sic], ambalo maana yake ni “Mwenye 
Kushukuriwa”. Alisema kwamba Wakristo walibadilisha neno Perikultos 
[sic] kwa Parakletos ili kukwepa lisilete maana ya Mtume Muhammad.
Mimi sikufahamu lugha ya Kiyunani, na kwakuwa ilikuwa vigumu 
kwangu kuiacha imani yangu niliyokuwa nayo kwa Mtume Muhammad, 
nilijiona kwamba nina dhiki. Bado Muhammad alikuwa na nafasi kubwa 
moyoni mwangu, nami niliona vigumu kuiondoa imani yangu kwake 
kama nabii.
Nilimwuliza profesa wa Kiyunani kuhusu maneno haya mawili, naye 
akanijibu hivi: Perikultos [sic] ni neno ambalo halipo katika kitabu cha 
Mtakatifu Yohana. Bali neno Parakletos lipo. Huonyesha jinsi ahadi 
ya Yesu (Yohana 14:16) ilivyotimizwa wakati Roho Mtakatifu alipokuja 
(Matendo 2:1–11), ambaye huishi siku zote na watu, kama mfariji na 
kiongozi.
Basi, nililiweka tatizo hilo katika mikono ya Mungu ili aweze kunipa 
ufahamu. Siku moja usiku, baada ya maombi yangu na nilipokuwa kitan-
dani, nilikosa usingizi. Nilisikia sauti ikisema kwamba: “Amka ili usome!” 
Nilidhani kwamba hayo ni mawazo yangu tu. Lakini nilisikia hivyo tena 
na tena. Niliamka, nikafungua Biblia yangu. Nilisoma mara kadhaa aya 
hizi zifuatazo katika Yohana 14: 15–17:

“Mkinipenda mtazishika amri zangu. Nami nitamwomba Baba, naye 
atawapa Msaidizi mwingine ili akae nanyi hata milele. Ndiye Roho wa 
kweli ambaye ulimwengu hauwezi kumpokea, kwa kuwa haumwoni 
wala haumtambui bali ni nyi mnamtambua maana anakaa kwenu naye 
atakuwa ndani yenu.”
Nilipokuwa nikisoma aya hizi, maswali mengi yalinijia akilini 
mwangu. Nilijiuliza kwamba, je! Nimewahi kusoma katika Kurani au 
Hadith kwamba Muhammad ni roho wa kweli ambaye siku zote yuko 
nasi, na kwamba nimshauri ambaye ulimwengu hauwezi kumwona wala 
kumjua, au kwamba anaishi ndani yangu? Ndipo nilipotambua kwamba 
maneno haya hayahusu nabii ajaye na hayawezi kumhusu mwanadamu 
awaye yote. Nilikumbuka kwamba maandiko haya yametimizwa katika 
Matendo 2:1–11, wakatiwa maisha ya wale Wakristo wa kwanza waliom-
wamini Yesu. Sasa nimeelewa ukweli huo mkuu. Mshauri ambaye Yesu 
aliahidi ni Roho Mtakatifu, Roho wa milele wa Mungu aliyehai na wala 
simalaika Jibra’il (au Gabrieli).
Even so, this question greatly bothered my thoughts. So! What is it con-
cerning Muḥammad about whom the Qurʾān claims that his coming was 
prophesied by Jesus?
“And when ʿĪsā son of Mary said: Oh you children of Israel! I am an 
Apostle of Almighty God to you, I who confirm that which was before 
me in the Torah, and give good news of the Apostle who will come after 
me whose name will be Aḥmad (that is He who should be thanked). But 
when he came to them with clear arguments, they said: This is clearly 
trickery” [Al-Ṣaff] (61:6).
The Arabic word for “He who should be Praised” is Aḥmad, which has 
an identical meaning as Muḥammad. So! does this writing not mean that 
Jesus spoke about the coming of Muḥammad? That is how I was taught, 
and I believed this.
I studied the Bible so that I could see whether it spoke of Muḥammad, 
but I did not see anything. I asked my teachers and they said that there 
was nothing concerning this matter. When I read an Islamic book con-
cerning the explanation or exegesis of the Qurʾān, I saw that they copied 
certain verses from the Bible that related to this Sūra [Al-Ṣaff] 61:6. The 
verse that was copied is,
“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper to be 
with you forever” (John 14:16).
The Greek word concerning Helper is “Parakletos”. (The books of the 
Gospel were written in the Greek language.) The exegete said that the root

word is Perikultos [sic], which has the meaning of “He who is Thanked”. 
He said that Christians changed the word Perikultos [sic] for Parakletos so 
that it should not give the meaning of the Apostle Muḥammad.
I did not understand the Greek language, and because it was hard 
for me to leave my belief in the Apostle Muḥammad, I was distressed. 
Muḥammad still had a great place in my heart, and I saw that it was hard 
to reject my belief in him as a prophet.
I asked a professor of Greek concerning these two words, and he 
answered like this: Perikultos [sic] is a word that is not in the Book of 
Saint John. But the word Parakletos is there. It shows how the promise 
of Jesus (John 14:16) was fulfilled when the Holy Spirit came (Acts 2:1–11), 
that dwells all the days with people, as a consoler and guide. So, I placed 
this problem in the hands of God so that he could give me understand-
ing. One day at night, after my prayers and I was in bed, I was unable to 
sleep. I heard a voice that said: “Get up so that you can read!!” I thought 
that this was only my own thoughts. But I heard this again and again. I 
got up, I opened my Bible. I read several times the following verses in 
John 14:15–17:
“If you love me you will keep my laws. And I will ask the Father, and 
he will give you another Helper to be with you forever. That is the Spirit 
of truth that the world is unable to receive, because it does not see him 
nor recognise him but you recognise him because he lives with you and 
he will be within you.”
When I read these verses, many questions came into my mind. I asked 
myself that, so! have I previously read in the Qurʾān or the Ḥadīth that 
Muḥammad is the spirit of truth who is with us all the time, and that he 
is an advisor whom the world is unable to see or know, or that he lives 
within me? Then I understood that these words did not concern a coming 
prophet and it could not concern any human. I remembered that these 
writings were fulfilled in Acts 2:1–11, at the time of those first Christians 
who believed in Jesus. Now I understood this great truth. The advisor that 
Jesus promised is the Holy Spirit, the everlasting Spirit of God who is alive 
and not the angel Jibrāʾīl (or Gabriel).
Alavi: 29–30
Alavi uses Al-Ṣaff (61):6, which is associated by Muslims with the verses from 
John as it refers to Muḥammad being foretold in the Bible and gives him the 
name Aḥmad. Aḥmad is understood by some as a name of Muḥammad (Déclais, 
2003: 501–2). If Aḥmad is taken as an ‘elative’ it is interpreted as ‘more highly 
praised’ (Robinson, 1991: 6). The Swahili word used in the tract is shukuriwa

(be thanked), it is unclear why this word was used by the translators of the 
tract rather than -sifiwa (be praised), as praised is used in the English version 
of the tract, following a common interpretation of the meaning of Aḥmad. The 
tract relates the struggles that Alavi faced between his respect and belief in 
Muḥammad as a prophet and his reading of the Bible and the interpretation 
given by his Muslim teachers.
Perikultos seems to be a typographical error for Periklutos, which is how 
A. Guthrie and E.F.F. Bishop transliterate it in ‘The Paraclete, Almunhamanna 
and Aḥmad’ published in 1951 (Guthrie and Bishop, 1951: 253). The English ver-
sion of Khan’s tract, uses Periklutos.
The tract then gives an explanation of the Muslim interpretation of 
John 14:16: ‘that Christians changed the word Perikultos [sic] for Parakletos so 
that it should not give the meaning of the Apostle Muḥammad.’ Alavi then 
relates that he consulted ‘a professor of Greek’ to explain the Greek words 
to him. Presumably this refers to one of the teachers at Concordia Seminary, 
Nagercoil, where he enrolled for a one-year Bible course in June 1970 (Alavi: 
22).
Alavi uses his own testimony to contrast the Muslim and Christian inter-
pretations of the verses. Verses 15–17 are then repeated to raise questions as to 
which interpretation is the correct one.
In the final phrase, when Alavi acknowledges that the verses refer to the 
Holy Spirit, ‘the everlasting Spirit of God who is alive and not the angel Jibrāʾīl 
(or Gabriel)’ he does not mention Muḥammad. Rather, he names the angel 
Jibrāʾīl, whom the tract has only previously mentioned once, in relation to a 
verse in the Qurʾān where he is giving a message to Mary (Alavi: 23). This lack 
of an explanation is perhaps because Alavi is primarily writing for Muslims, 
who would understand the role that the angel Jibrāʾīl, as a messenger of God, 
has in the Qurʾān.
Both Kanoni and Alavi are keen to demonstrate that scripture supports their 
reasons for converting. Kanoni’s polemical approach and willingness to criti-
cise the Biblical text, with accusations of deliberate alteration of the text, con-
trasts with Alavi, who is more eirenic in tone and more respectful to the text of 
the Qurʾān. Both are actively seeking ways to encourage others to follow them 
in leaving one faith and converting to the other.

The origins of Warsha ya Waandishi wa Kiislamu (Muslim Writers’ Workshop) 
(Warsha), can be traced to Muhammad Hussein Malik, a Pakistani who went 
to Tanzania in 1964 to teach mathematics in Secondary Schools and also taught 
the dini (religion) periods to Muslim students. When some of his former stu-
dents went to the University of Dar es Salaam, he encouraged them to write, 
and they met each week at his home. They also became involved in Muslim 
Students’ Association of the University of Dar es Salaam (MSAUD) and later, 
together with Malik, they worked for Baraza Kuu la Waislamu wa Tanzania 
(Supreme Council of Muslims of Tanzania) (BAKWATA). Their activist involve-
ment in trying to change the direction of BAKWATA led to the government

deporting Malik in 1982. He moved to Kenya where he worked with the Islamic 
Foundation, helping Warsha to publish several books. The main writer for 
Warsha is Mohamed Said (born 1952) who helped to maintain the impetus of 
Warsha after Malik’s departure. Said has also published several ‘research arti-
cles’ and was critical of the government’s educational policies (Chesworth, 
2006: 175–85).
Mohamed Said, worked for the Harbour Authority in Tanga and published a 
number of books about the role of Muslims in the Independence struggles. The 
Life and Times of Abdulwahid Sykes (1924–1968) (1998), which was also published 
in Swahili (2002). His website: Mohamed Said: Historia, Siasa na Maendeleo 
Tanzania (Mohamed Said: History, Politics and Progress of Tanzania) http://
www.mohammedsaid.com/ includes copies of a number of articles about the 
role of Christianity in denying the rights of Muslims in Tanzania.1
This tract was probably written whilst members of Warsha were working 
for BAKWATA and originally published through the Islamic Foundation, after 
Malik began working with them in Nairobi.
In seven chapters it presents different aspects of life and shows how in all 
things Islam can be the only satisfactory way of life. It begins with Mwanadamu 
hawezi kuishi bila Dini Njia ya Maisha (Man is unable to live without Religion, 
the Way of Life) (pp. 1–22), which contrasts different approaches to religion, 
before concluding that Islam is the correct one. This is then demonstrated in 
Uislam Ndio Njia Pekee ya Maisha Iliyo Sahihi (Islam is indeed the only cor-
rect way of life) (pp. 23–9) and Namna ya Kuufuata Uislam (The way to fol-
low Islam) (pp. 30–6). The uniformity of all God’s apostles is then emphasised 
(pp. 37–8). Chapter five (pp. 39–43) and chapter six (pp. 45–61) are an extended 
examination of Human Rights and Islam’s right to supervise them. The final 
chapter asks Ni Yupi Mwenye Utu Kamili (Who is it who has the perfect person-
ality) (pp. 62–5).
The tract uses the Qurʾān to support all the points that are made. The transla-
tion used largely follows the Qurani Takatifu (al-Farsy), but with slight changes, 
which seem to be for emphasis. Using Sūra Āl ʿImrān (3):19 as an example of

Lacunza Balda comments ‘The difference lies in the fact that, according to the 
Warsha translation, religion (dini), is understood as Njia ya Maisha (The Way of 
Life). In al-Farsy’s view there is certainly no indication to suggest that the term 
“religion” might mean “way of life”’ (Lacunza Balda, 1997: 122).
Dini translated here as ‘religion’, comes from the Arabic dīn which has a 
wider range of meanings including judgement and retribution as well as an 
obligation to ‘discharge the debt of worship’ (Gardet, 1999: 293).
The approach is apologetic in that it only uses the Qurʾān, but it is also 
polemical in tone, as it attacks the actions of other societies in order to show 
that Islam is the correct way.
Warsha use several verses: Al-Shūrā (42):13, Āl ʿImrān (3):84–5 and Al-Bayyina 
(98):1, 6, to demonstrate that Muḥammad followed the teaching of the earlier 
Prophets, beginning with Adam, and that there is only one religion.

Chapter 10
Adam (a.s.) mpaka Nabii Muhammad (s.a.w.) walifundisha Njia moja 
na MOJA PEKEE, na Maisha nayo ni UISLAM (Utiifu na unyenyekevu 
kwa Mwenyezi Mungu) ambao itikadi yake tumeiona kwa urefu hapo 
nyuma. Hivyo madai ya kuwa kuna Dini nyingine Sahihi (ya kweli mbele 
ya Mwenyezi Mungu) kuliko hii moja kama wanavyodai Wakristo, 
Mayahudi (Juddaists [sic]) na watu wa dini nyinginezo si kweli kabisa na 
wala hawana uthibitisho wowote juu ya madai yao. Ndio maana Mtume 
Muhammad (s.a.w.) kabla ya kupewa Utume, pamoja na kwamba aliku-
tana na Mayahudi an Wakristo, hukuvutia kabisa na dini zao kwa sababu 
hakuona tofauti yoyote iliyopo kati ya hao waliosema kuwa wanaamini 
na wale jamaa zake Makuraysh ambao hawakuamini. Maovu yote yali-
yokuwa yakifanywa na Makuraysh ambayo yalikuwa yakimkera sana ali-
yakuta yakifanywa vile vile na Mayahud an Wakristo. Kwa mfano jamaa 
zake walikuwa walevi, wazinifu, wacheza kamari, waonevu, wanyang-
anyi, waongo, walaghai, na kadhalika, Mayahudi na Wakristo nao wali-
kuwa wakifanya maovu hayo hayo. Baada ya kupewa Utume, Mtume 
Muhammad (s.a.w.) alifahamishwa na Mola wake kuwa dini ni moja 
tu na Ndio Dini ya Mitume wote waliletwa hapa ulimwenguni. Qur’an 
Tukufu inatueleza haya katika Sura ya 42 (Ash-Shura) Aya ya 13):
“Amekupeni Sharia ya dini ile ile aliyomwusia Nuhu na tuliyokufunu-
lia wewe na tuliyowausia Ibrahimu na Musa na Isa, kwamba simamish-
eni dini wala msifarikiane kwayo, (kwa ajili ya dini); ni ngumu kwa 
washirikina (dini hii) unayowaitia; (42:13).
Pia katika Sura 3 (Al-Imran) Aya ya 84 Mwenyezi Mungu (s.w.) 
Anatuambia:
“Sema: ‘Tumemwamini Mwenyezi Mungu, na yale tuliyoteremshiwa 
na yale yaliyoteremshiwa Ibrahim na Ismail na Ishak na Yaakub na 
wajukuu na yale aliyopewa Musa na Isa na Manabii wengine kutoka kwa 
Mola wao. Hatubagui bana [sic] yao hata mmoja, na sisi tunanyenyekea 
Kwake’.” (3:84)
Pia Mtume (s.a.w.) alifahamishwa na Mola Wake kwamba Mayahudi na 
Wakristo pamoja na kudai kwao kuwa wanamuamini Mwenyezi Mungu 
na Mitume wao, hawakuwa Waislam kwa sababu walikuwa wakiamini 
kwa kutamka tu katika vinywa vyao lakini katika nyoyo zao na vitendo 
vyao walikuwa Makafiri kama walivyokuwa Makurayshi. Haya pia yame-
thibitishwa katika Qur’an Tukufu Sura 98 (Al-Bayyinah) Aya ya 1 na 6 (98:1 
na 6).
“Wale walio kufuru miongoni mwa watu wa Kitabu (Mayahudi na 
Wakristo) na Washirikina hawa kukufuru mpaka ilipowajia hoja iliyo 
dhahiri (juu ya ukweli).” ([98]:1).

“Bila shaka wale waliokufuru miongoni mwa watu waliopewa Kitabu 
na Washirikina wataingia katika moto wajahannamu, wakae humo 
milele, hao ni waovu waviumbe.” ([98]:6)
Kwa hiyo Mtume (s.a.w.) ndiye alitufahamisha ukweli huu ya kwamba 
NJIA YA MAISHA YA KWELI NA SAHIHI ni MOJA TU na atakayefuata 
njia nyingine isiyo kuwa hii atakuwa hana chake hapo kesho Kiyama ni 
kama Qur’an Tukufu inavyotueleza katika Sura ya 3 (Al-Imran) Aya ya 85:
“Na anayetaka dini isiyokuwa ya Kiislamu basi haitakubaliwa naye. 
Naye Akhera atakuwa katika wenye khasara (kubwa kabisa).” (3:85).
Likewise, we see following the difficulty that was there at the time of 
Prophet Abraham (a.s.), Prophet Lot, Ishmael and Isaac were chosen to 
be the helpers of the Prophet Abraham in various places at one time. 
Therefore, the matter to consider is that all the Apostles beginning with 
the Prophet Adam (a.s.) until the Prophet Muḥammad (s.a.w.) taught 
One way and ONE ONLY, and that Life is ISLAM (Obedience and humil-
ity for Almighty God) which belief we have seen in detail previously. So 
the claims that there is another Religion which is Correct (true before 
Almighty God) more than this one, as claim Christians and Jews (Judaists) 
and people of other religions is completely untrue and nor do they have 
any proof at all for their claims. Indeed the Apostle Muḥammad (s.a.w.) 
before being given his Apostleship, together with the fact that he met 
with Jews and Christians, was not drawn to their religions at all because 
he could not see any difference within them between those who said they 
were believers and those relatives of his the Quraysh who were unbe-
lievers. All evil that was done by the Quraysh that annoyed him greatly 
when he met it was likewise done by Jews and Christians. For example 
his family were drunkards, adulterers, gamblers, tyrants, robbers, liars, 
tricksters, etc. Jews and Christians themselves also performed these evil 
acts. After being given Apostleship, the Prophet Muḥammad (s.a.w.) was 
instructed by his Lord that religion is only one and indeed that is the 
religion of all the Apostles who were brought here to earth. The Glorious 
Qurʾān explains this in Sūra 42 (Al-Shūrā) Verse 13):
“He has given you the Law of the same religion that he gave Noah and 
which we revealed to you and that we gave to Abraham and Moses and 
ʿĪsā, that strengthen the religion and do not differ with them, (for the sake 
of the religion); it is hard for those who associate with (this religion) to 
which you call them; ([Al-Shūrā] 42:13).
Also in Sūra 3 (Āl ʿImrān) Verse 84 Almighty God (s.w.) tells us:

Chapter 10
“Say: ‘We believe in Almighty God, and that which was sent down to 
us and that which was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and 
Jacob and his descendants [literally: grand-children] and that which was 
given to Moses and ʿĪsā and other Prophets from their Lord. We make no 
distinction between one and another, and to Him we bow our will.’” ([Āl 
ʿImrān] 3:84)
Also the Apostle (s.a.w.) was informed by His Lord that the Jews and 
Christians together with claiming that they believe in Almighty God and 
their Messengers, were not Muslims because they only believed with 
their mouths but in their hearts and in their actions they were Infidels 
in the same way as the Quraysh. This is also confirmed in the Glorious 
Qurʾān Sūra 98 (Al-Bayyina) Verses 1 and 6 (98:1 and 6).
“Those who were disbelievers amongst the people of the Book (Jews 
and Christians) and the Superstitious they did not believe in you until 
there came a clear witness (of the truth).” ([Al-Bayyina 98]:1).
“Certainly, those who disbelieved amongst the People who were given 
the Book and the Superstitious will enter in fires of hell, they will stay 
there for ever, they are the worst of creatures.” ([Al-Bayyina 98]:6)
Therefore, the Apostle (s.a.w.) indeed informed us of this truth that 
the WAY OF TRUE AND CORRECT LIFE is ONLY ONE and he who 
will follow another way than this will have nothing tomorrow at the Day 
of Judgement as the Glorious Qurʾān explains to us in Sūra 3 (Āl ʿImrān) 
Verse 85:
“And he who wants a religion other than Islam it will not be accepted 
of him. For him the Hereafter will be a (very great) loss.” ([Āl ʿImrān] 3:85).
Warsha: 24–6
In its introduction to Al-Shūrā (42):13 the tract makes clear that all the proph-
ets from Adam, whom Muslims consider to be a prophet, have faithfully taught 
‘One way and ONE ONLY […] ISLAM’, and that the Christians and Jews falsely 
claim that there is more than one correct religion.
The tract comments that Muḥammad was not attracted to Judaism and 
Christianity as religions, as he saw no difference in the behaviour of the adher-
ents and that of the Quraysh, his own people, who had turned from monothe-
ism. Examples of unacceptable behaviour are listed, and then verses from Āl 
ʿImrān and Al-Bayyina are quoted, on a similar theme. The tract implies that 
the Jews and Christians of Muḥammad’s time were munāfiqūn (hypocrites) 
as they ‘only believed with their mouths [and not] in their hearts’; they were 
called kafirūn (infidels) as were the Quraysh. By calling Jews and Christians 
kafirūn the tract goes beyond the teaching of orthodox Islam.

Warsha was strongly influenced by Hussain Malik who was the initiator and 
mentor of the group. Malik used a similar approach when he taught them. See 
Chesworth (2006: 176–9) for an analysis of the influence that Hussain Malik 
had on Warsha. In his The Mission of Jesus: Divine Principles of World Order 
Malik quotes Al-Shūrā (42):13 as part of his Introduction to the book to show 
that Jesus was the follower of the same religion as earlier prophets, with the 
same message and preparing the way for Muḥammad (Malik, 1993: xiii–xv).

Worksheet written by Cecil Simbaulanga for his organization Biblia 
ni Jibu to train Christians who are talking to Muslims.
This is the only Christian tract studied here written directly in Swahili. It is 
produced by a group called Biblia ni Jibu (The Bible is the Answer). Biblia ni 
Jibu describes itself as ‘a national non-profit making organisation founded as a 
fellowship of churches, church related organisations and individuals working 
for Evangelization of Muslims in Tanzania’ (Biblia ni Jibu, nd: 1).
This group was founded by Cecil Simbaulanga in late 1992, as a response 
to Muslim preachers in Dar es Salaam. Cecil Simbaulanga is originally from 
Songea in Southern Tanzania, but he is based in Dar es Salaam. In Biblia ni Jibu: 
Brief History the organisation explains its origins:

Chapter 10
[in] October 1992 at Mnazi Mmoja Grounds in Dar es Salaam where 
Muslim preachers had been conducting open-air debate with Christians 
aimed at ridiculing the Bible and Christianity. The preaching was aimed 
at distorting Christian Doctrines, Biblical Messages and Christian History. 
It is said that its impact was grave as many Christians were converted to 
Islam. Realizing that Christianity was under attack by Muslim zealots, a 
few young Christians led by Cecil Simbaulanga felt a strong need to work 
closely together regardless of their denominations, to respond to chal-
lenges posed by the Muslim preachers.
Biblia ni Jibu, nd: 1
Once Biblia ni Jibu was formed, they collected the questions used by Muslim 
preachers to ridicule the Bible and Christianity, in order to be able to respond 
to them. They gathered 150 questions, then used the Bible to answer them. 
The name of the group came from this: Biblia ni Jibu, meaning The Bible is the 
Answer (Biblia ni Jibu, nd: 1). Because of religious tensions in 1993 following 
attacks on Pork Butchers’ Shops, mihadhara were banned and Biblia ni Jibu did 
not begin preaching until 1996, then:
After the 1998 Mwembechai Killings in Dar es Salaam, “Biblia ni Jibu” 
stopped its activities and went into hiding for fear of being tortured by 
state machinery as police rounded up many militant preachers. Cecil 
Simbaulanga and Moses Ndimbo were also remanded. They stayed under 
police custody for 17 days. In May 1999, Cecil was remanded [again] for 
11 days.
Biblia ni Jibu, nd: 1
From 1999, Simbaulanga prepared a series of Worksheets, to be used to train 
members of Biblia ni Jibu. Tuzumgumze No. 1 Somo la Dini (Let us talk/discuss 
Number 1. The Lesson of Religion) was the first of the worksheets; four others 
were collected in February 2001 when the researcher met Cecil Simbaulanga 
in Tanga. Six additional worksheets, written either by Simbaulanga, or 
Eleutery H. Kobelo were also available on the Biblia ni Jibu website.
They are all written in a simplistic manner and are naïve in content and 
approach.
When this material was written, Cecil Simbaulanga had no theological 
training; since then he has studied at St Mark’s College, Dar es Salaam (2002–5) 
for a Certificate in Theology (Mtweve, e-mail: 14.08.07).
Biblia ni Jibu operated a website http://biblianijibu.netfirms.com/ which 
contains material aimed at challenging Muslims and answering their questions.

The group has also continued to hold public debates and has caused tensions. 
Meetings can be conducted in Mosques and Churches without Police permis-
sion, whereas meetings held in public areas require a Police Permit. In the case 
of the meeting in Kigoma, the Police took out an injunction to stop the meet-
ing, even though it was being held in a church.
Tanzania Daima, a web-based newspaper, reports on 22 August 2006 
that police stopped a meeting in a Moravian Church in Kigoma where Cecil 
Simbaulanga was to speak on Ujue uislamu asili yake (You should know the 
origins of Islam). It was reported that the speech would be an attack on the 
influence of the Organisation of Islamic Conferences (OIC) in Tanzania, which 
is given as the reason for police intervening (Tanzania Daima, 22.08.2006).
Simbaulanga and his colleagues have continued to be watched closely by 
the police. The United States Department of State Human Rights Report for 
Tanzania in 2008 says:
In October a trial magistrate dismissed the 2006 case against Christian 
minister Cecil Simbaulanga for lack of evidence; Simbaulanga had been 
arrested for “inflammatory preaching” that insulted Islam. However, he 
still had to answer other charges of insulting Islam in a separate incident 
in Kigoma region.
US Dept. of State 2009
More recently, Cecil Simbaulanga, calling himself Evangelist Apologist, has 
published a number of tracts, including, Hivi ni kweli Yesu Kristo ndiye Issa wa 
Quran? (Is it true that Jesus Christ is indeed Isa of the Qurʾān), Majibu ya vitabu 
vya Kiislam kuhusu asili ya Uislamu (Answers to Muslim books concerning the 
origins of Islam), Chanzo cha Mihadhara ya Kidini Tanzania: Biblia ni Jibu 1992–
2021 (Origin of religious debates in Tanzania: The Bible is the answer 1992–
2021) which are available through his Facebook page, he also has a YouTube 
channel with several talks posted.
Material on the Biblia ni Jibu website is as poorly typed as the printed tracts 
are and contains typographical and grammatical errors.
The tract Je Roho Mtakatifu ndiye yule Msaidizi? (Is the Holy Spirit really 
that Helper?) begins with a Foreword (page 1) that states that when Muslims 
ask questions concerning the apostleship of Muḥammad they run to the Bible 
because the Qurʾān is insufficient. It then sets out the case for Muḥammad 
being the msaidizi (helper) and raises questions to ask about this (pp. 2–3). The 
work of the Holy Spirit is then explained (pp. 2–5) before concluding with how 
Jesus’s promise to send a Helper came to pass and a warning against those who 
claim that Muḥammad is that Helper (pp. 5–6).

Chapter 10
The tract can be regarded as being polemical in its approach. It concentrates 
on passages from John’s Gospel that concern Jesus’s promise to send a Helper, 
using them to emphasise the case against Muḥammad, and also using eight 
passages from the Qurʾān to argue its case.
Simbaulanga uses John 14:15–17 to test the claim that Muḥammad could be 
the ‘helper’.
Yohana 14:15–17 Mkinipenda mtazishika amri zangu nami nitamwomba 
baba naye atawapa msaidizi mwingine ili akae nanyi hata milele ndiye 
roho wa kweli, ambaye ulimwengu hauwezi kumpokea, kwa kuwa

akina Yohana, Petro, Yakobo n.k. walimpokea Mohammad? Au yeye

Kwa maana hiyo huyo msaidizi ambaye ni roho wa kweli ataletwa

a)	Je, kama ni Muhammad waislamu wanakubali kuwa Bwana Yesu 
ndiye aliyemleta Muhammad?

John 14:15–17 If you love me you will keep my laws and I will ask the 
Father and he will give you another helper so that he will dwell with you 
always and he is the spirit of truth, who the world are not able to receive, 
because they will not see nor will they will they recognise, rather you will 
recognise because he will live with you and he will be within you.
In these verses there are things that are important to know
1.	 WHO IS THE HELPER – (SPIRIT OF TRUTH)
2.	 WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THE HELPER
3.	 HE WILL LIVE FOREVER
4.	 THE WORLD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE HIM
5.	 THE WORLD WILL NOT SEE THAT HELPER
6.	 THE WORLD WILL NOT RECOGNISE IT
7.	 THE RECIPIENTS OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, THAT IS THE 
DISCIPLES OF THE LORD JESUS, RECOGNISE HIM
8.	 AGAIN, IT IS THE RECIPIENTS, THAT IS, THE DISCIPLES OF 
LORD JESUS, WITH WHOM HE WILL DWELL

Companions and the Muslims?

John, Peter, James etc. receive Muḥammad? Or did he see the disci-
ples of Jesus?
4.	 Because in the world are Muslims who deny Jesus John 15:18–19. 
Therefore they are not able to receive him.
5.	 The Lord Jesus said that the helper the spirit of truth is not seen but 
Muḥammad was seen.
6.	 Muḥammad died and the helper will live forever
These things of the Lord Jesus are very serious [lit. heavy] not just to 
be read in a superficial way [;] it is essential that it be considered atten-
tively. Often Muslims use these verses that were said by the Lord Jesus 
to say that it is Muḥammad. Well then let’s look at the characteristics 
of the helper and also his work as I began to say of the promises of the 
helper, the Lord Jesus began to discuss it beginning with John 14:15 
and 16, in the verses in Chapter 16 he describes the work of that helper
Questions to ask oneself
	
1.	 Who is it that brought that helper
	
2.	 Verse 7 the Lord Jesus said but I will go to my place and I will 
send him to you.
	
In this way that helper who is the spirit of truth will be brought by 
the Lord Jesus.
a)	If it is Muḥammad do Muslims agree that it was the Lord Jesus 
that brought Muḥammad?
b)	If that helper is Muḥammad, will they agree that there is a 
‘boss’ who brought him and that he Muḥammad is a helper?
c)	If the helper is the Prophet as they themselves say, who is it 
that brought the prophets? Without a doubt the answer is 
God. According to verse 7 the Lord Jesus said but I will go to 
my place and I will send him to you. Do they agree that Jesus is 
God?
d)	If the helper is Muḥammad did the disciples of the Lord Jesus 
see him?
Simbaulanga: 1–3 [Emphasis in the original]
The tract gives John 14:15–17 and then lists eight things that it is important for the 
reader to know, concerning the characteristics of the ‘Helper’. These are in cap-
itals, as if to emphasise their importance to the reader. It states that the ‘World’ 
will not be able to ‘receive’, ‘see’ or be able to ‘recognise’ the ‘Helper’. ‘World’ 
here is used in a religious sense, echoing Romans 16:2 ‘Do not be conformed

to this world […]’, which would be understood by the intended readers of the 
worksheet, who would have largely come from a Christian background and be 
familiar with the use of ‘World’ in this manner. The list concludes by clearly 
stating that the ‘recipients’ would be the ‘disciples’, who would both ‘recognise’ 
the ‘Spirit of truth’ and that the Spirit would dwell in them.
Having set out what should be understood, it then asks ‘if the helper is 
Muḥammad’ and gives six responses which question whether Muḥammad 
could be the ‘helper’.
These appear to be used as points in any discussion with Muslims concern-
ing whether or not Muḥammad is the ‘helper’.
The final section examines the characteristics of the ‘helper’ using John 16:7, 
without quoting it:
Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for 
if I do not go away, the Advocate [Helper] will not come to you; but if I go, 
I will send him to you.
New Revised Standard Version
The reader is asked, ‘who is it who sends the helper?’ and a series of four state-
ments are given, which attempt to demonstrate through an exercise in logic: 
if Jesus is the one to send the ‘Helper’, Jesus is God; and if Muḥammad is the 
‘Helper’ did Jesus’s disciples see him?
Simbaulanga uses the passage, together with John 16:7, to provide readers of 
the worksheet with points, which are set out using a form of logic, to help them 
to respond to Muslims in discussion.
Simbaulanga does not mention the accusations of change in the text, rather 
he uses logic.
Simbaulanga quotes a part of Al-Māʾida (5):75 by itself as part of his attack 
on the idea of Muḥammad being the ‘helper’ promised by Jesus:
a)	Kama huyo msaidizi ni Muhammad ni wapi alipomtukuza Yesu?
Qurani Al-Maidah 5.75 Masih bin Maryamu si chochote ila ni mtume tu 
na bila shaka mitume wengi wamepita kabla yake. (hawajaona) na mam-
ake ni mwanamke mkweli (na) wote wawili walikuwa wakila chakula (na 
wakienda choo basi waungu gani wanao kula na kwenda choo? …
b)	Kwa aya hiyo Muhammad amemkashifu Masihi.
a)	If that helper is Muḥammad where is it that he praises Jesus?
Qurʾān Al-Māʾida (5):75 The Messiah son of Mary is nothing other than 
a messenger and without doubt many other messengers came before 
him. ([H]ave they not seen) that his mother is a true woman (and) the

two of them were eating food (and they went to the toilet well what gods 
are they that eat and go to the toilet? …
b)	With this verse Muḥammad slanders the Messiah.
Simbaulanga: 4
The tract asks where is it that Muḥammad praises Jesus. Using Al-Farsy’s ver-
sion, the verse is quoted and the references to Jesus being nothing more than 
a messenger and going to the toilet are used to show that rather than praising 
Jesus, Muḥammad slanders the Messiah. The passage does not explain that 
Jesus and the Messiah refer to the same person, assuming that this would be 
understood by the readership.
A series of Qurʾānic verses are quoted in order to refute the claim that 
Muḥammad is the true Spirit, the ‘Helper’.
Tunaona katika mafundisho ya Muhamad akisema.
(a) (Qurani Surat Al –Anam 6:101 wanyama) inamkinikaje awe na 
mwana hali hana mke?….
(b) Suraf As – SAATFAT: 37: 47–49 peponi watapata wanawake
(c) Suraf AL – WAQIAH: 56:22–23 watapata wanawake wenye macho

(d) Suraf AT-TAWBA 9:30 Na Mayahudi wanasema Uzenni mwana

We see in the teaching of Muḥammad that he says.

tiful eyes (of cups)

Chapter 10
(without measure) those that imitate the words of those who blas-
phemed before them. Almighty God will destroy them as they are.
Through the evidence of these few verses of the Qurʾān it is confirmed 
that Muḥammad is not the helper, that is the true Spirit because he did 
not take Jesus’s words and teach them, in contrast he opposed the teach-
ings of the Lord Jesus.
Simbaulanga: 5 [Emphasis in the original]
Simbaulanga gives references to various passages, making a brief statement, 
without quoting the text, with the aim of shocking and sensationalising, with-
out any attempt at explanation. The section finishes with a statement which 
has little basis from the passages quoted, claiming that these verses make it 
clear that Muḥammad is not the helper.
The tract’s purpose is to equip other Christians to enable them to respond to 
challenges made by Muslim preachers. The tract uses a series of ‘proof texts’ to 
make a case, interpreting scripture in such a way as to advance the argument, 
regardless of whether it is a correct understanding of the passage. The approach 
and style used is similar to that used by Muslim preachers of the Bible, such as 
Ngariba and Kawemba and was developed to counter that approach.
The two tracts were prepared by groups who had definite objectives: Warsha 
seeking to revive Islam and to provide teaching to help fellow believers; Cecil 
Simbaulanga and Biblia ni Jibu wanting to counteract the perceived threat of 
Muslim Preachers of the Bible and mihadhara to Christians. Both tracts were 
prepared to inform members of the faith of the authors. Both tend to be dog-
matic and didactic in style and content. Both tracts seek to shape attitudes to 
the ‘other’ in a particular way concomitant with the views of the authors.

Chapter 11
Concluding Remarks
The ways in which the tracts looked at in the previous chapters use scripture 
serve to illustrate Muslim use of the Bible and Christian use of the Qurʾān and 
the mixed messages that are presented to the reader.
In part 1, the range and availability of Christian tracts in Swahili in East Africa 
since the middle of the nineteenth century was looked at. This demonstrated 
that Christian missionaries in their tracts were seeking to present the truth of 
Christ, whilst acknowledging the presence of Islam, often in a manner aimed 
at ‘warning’ Christians of the dangers of the other faith. Also, that Muslims 
were producing tracts, largely aimed at educating their fellow Muslims, rather 
than referring to Christianity.
That Swahili can be used as a religious language to communicate the mes-
sages of Christianity and Islam was substantiated. One question raised by 
translators was: ‘Should the Bible in Swahili use words which had their origins 
in Arabic, the language of the Qurʾān?’ To avoid doing so, circumlocutions were 
used, or Latin root words were used for names, as in the case of Moses, usually 
Musa, but in some Bible versions given as Mose.
For Muslims, using Swahili words which may be understood differently by 
Christians, such as neema, grace/mercy, or using neologisms constructed by 
Christians, such as takatifu for Holy also was a potential source of confusion.
Thus, it became clear that the use of ‘loan words’ from Greek and Hebrew, 
often via English for Christians, or from Arabic for Muslims, led to a failure 
to communicate adequately, potentially giving rise to confusion due to mixed 
messages being communicated.
It is clear that ‘mixed messages’, that is, hearing one thing and understand-
ing it in a different way, were present in the material produced during the colo-
nial period.
Setting the contemporary use of tracts within its historical context allows 
for an understanding of the approaches used in the tracts in the second part.
The tracts studied and their use of scripture, as presented in the second 
part, reveal that mixed messages continued after independence, when most of 
the tracts studied in the second part were written.
There were three different purposes for the tracts studied.
Some were written to inform and convince the ‘other’ of the truth claims 
of one’s faith, through the use of scripture, in order to refute the other’s faith.

Chapter 11
Other tracts were testimonies of those who had changed from one faith to 
the other, using scripture in order to show how one scripture is wrong, or sup-
ports the truth of the other.
Finally, some tracts were written as teaching material to train readers of 
one’s own faith about the faith of the ‘other’.
Analysis of the tracts showed them to be mainly polemical in content and 
approach, with very little use of eirenic or apologetic language. The writers 
of most of the tracts were careful not to be offensive about either Jesus or 
Muḥammad, but the language used about Christians or Muslims was often 
more robust.
Generally, the verses of scripture were used poorly; the tendency was to 
use parts of verses to make or to prove a point, otherwise several verses were 
quoted from different sources, which might well overwhelm the reader, who 
would then not notice jumps in logic.
It was found that Christian interpretation of Bible passages generally 
accorded with accepted Protestant Christian understanding of the pas-
sages, but with a very poor standard of exegesis, with little insight or correct 
application.
Likewise, it was found that Muslim interpretation of Qurʾānic passages gen-
erally accorded with Sunnī interpretation of the material. Some of the tracts 
written by Muslims did attempt tafsīr of the Qurʾān, notably Saidi Musa and 
Warsha.
When Christian tracts used the Qurʾān, and Muslim tracts used the Bible, 
the interpretation often differed from the interpretation given by the respec-
tive faith. Both Christian and Muslim tracts appeared to deduce the interpre-
tation needed from the verses of scripture, with little attempt at understanding 
the context in which the scripture was revealed.
It can be seen through the examples of text translated and interpreted that 
whilst the writers were used to quoting the scriptures, it often appeared that 
they had a limited understanding of both their own and the other faith. Verses 
were often taken out of context and used as ‘proof texts’ to support specific 
points.
Muslims’ understanding of scripture is different from that of Christians, 
meaning that any new version of a biblical passage in Swahili that contains 
differences compared with another version is seen by Muslims as an illustra-
tion that Christians are changing their scripture to support their own personal 
viewpoint, charging them with taḥrīf (corruption) of scripture. This is in con-
trast with their understanding of their own scripture, in Arabic, as unchang-
ing and unalterable. This accounts for many of the points of criticism against 
Christians in Muslim tracts.

Concluding Remarks
The material examined also revealed problems with understanding the 
meaning of one’s own scripture and faith as well as the other’s. This raises 
questions about how translatable scripture is, both in the process of transla-
tion, whether word for word or dynamic equivalence, as well as how key words 
are understood by each faith.
Whatever their purpose, all the tracts used scripture to promote their own 
faith against the other’s faith. The approaches used and the tenor of the argu-
ments echo the polemic often found in public debates, Mihadhara.
Some Muslim writers charged Christians with changing the meaning of the 
Bible, taḥrīf, in order to ‘hide’ the truth. This ‘truth’ might be that Muḥammad 
is revealed in the Bible, or that different versions of the Bible in Swahili say 
different things, raising doubts about the veracity of the text.
Likewise some Christian writers used the Qurʾān in Swahili and failed to 
differentiate the interpretation, tafsīr, from the text, doing this to ridicule the 
Qurʾān and Islam.
In using the scripture in order to discredit it, the writers are giving mixed 
messages, which gives rise to the question as to the value of using each other’s 
scripture.
If you are convinced of the truth of your own faith and its scripture, whether 
the Bible or the Qurʾān, should you use the scripture of the other at all? By 
using the other’s scripture, it is being accorded a legitimacy, even if it is being 
ridiculed or disparaged.
From a Muslim perspective it can be argued that parts of the Bible are 
acknowledged as Scripture and as such can be quoted: Tawrā (Torah, the first 
five books of the Old Testament), Zabur (Psalms) and Injīl (Gospel of Jesus), as 
well as various Old Testament figures, who are named in the Qurʾān. However, 
many other books of the Bible are used in the tracts to show the truth of Islam, 
or raise doubts about Christianity.
For Christians, as the Qurʾān was written down more recently than the Bible, 
its very status as scripture is questionable, so using it to support the truths of 
Christianity is regarded as dubious.
Mixed messages result from the ways in which the tracts use scripture to 
show their own faith favourably, while raising doubts about the other faith 
through deliberate, ignorant or accidental misinterpretation. The rise in lit-
eracy and the availability of the material in the tracts have in some ways pro-
duced new tensions between the faith communities.
Much of the material was polemical in tone and approach, leading one to 
question whether winning the argument wins the convert, or if it hardens atti-
tudes as to the wrongness of the ‘other’, confirming the reader in their own 
preconceptions about the other faith.

Chapter 11
The historical survey and the detailed examination of the selected tracts 
reveal that both Muslim and Christian authors present mixed messages in 
their writings. Whilst seeking to gain the attention and potential support of 
the reader through using scripture, either from the Bible or the Qurʾān, the 
interpretation given of the passages added a layer of confusion, leading to the 
reader questioning the legitimacy of the text. This questioning of legitimacy in 
turn could be regarded as a way of reaching to the other by casting doubts on 
their own faith.
The use of the Qurʾān in Christian tracts, when the tract writer is most likely 
to treat the passage to suit their own purposes, results in its misinterpretation. 
This results in difficulties for pious Muslims, especially when the passages 
of scripture from the Qurʾān are in Arabic. The very presence of verses from 
the Qurʾān in Arabic gives the tract an exalted status meaning that it is diffi-
cult to dispose of, as it includes sacred text. Ahmed Deedat saw that as one of 
the tricks of Christian evangelists to inveigle their message into the homes of 
Muslim believers (Deedat, Combat Kit Against Bible Thumpers, video).
The use of the Bible in Muslim tracts, where the author may well be refuting 
selected passages of scripture to affirm the truth of Islam, results in confusion 
for the Christian, especially when apparent inconsistencies seen in various 
versions of the Bible are used to raise doubts as to the veracity of Christian 
scripture. This is seen in the locally produced tract Sisi ni wasomaji, which can 
be seen in Appendix 2.
The purpose of the tracts examined can be seen as an attempt to use the 
scripture of the other, to attract or to attack. However, the legitimacy of quot-
ing each other’s scripture and determining who has the right to interpret scrip-
ture is key to the reception of these tracts in the communities for which they 
are produced.
Printed tracts are now reducing in importance as communication through 
print is superseded by electronic forms of communication. Tracts in print 
form may soon cease to circulate, as the faith communities increasingly turn 
to electronic media to propagate their message, through the internet and text 
messaging. However, the texts of the tracts themselves may well continue to 
be used through websites. One tract, by Cecil Simbaulanga, for Biblia ni Jibu, 
was web-based, and as such can be regarded as an early attempt to use the 
then-nascent internet to reach a wider audience with the contents. A study of 
Muslim websites in East Africa during the early years of the century revealed 
the problems of developing and hosting websites. It was found that at that 
time most sites were dependent on diaspora groups to provide the expertise; 
many of these groups subsequently lost interest, and the sites were aban-
doned (Chesworth, 2007b).The growth of satellite channels, with Christian

Concluding Remarks
‘televangelists’ broadcasting for many hours a week, and the Muslim Peace TV, 
based in Mumbai, continuing to broadcast Ahmed Deedat, ‘Man with a mis-
sion’, each week, has led to globalisation of the message, with less possibility of 
contextualisation from a local perspective. SMS text services sending out daily 
scripture portions, and social media developing ‘private networks’ where truth 
claims are presented, and others challenged, add a new dynamic. Many of the 
ways in which scripture is used and abused through new media reflect its use 
in the tracts, which in turn echo how Christians and Muslims have used each 
other’s scriptures since the seventh century.1
External influences are increasing, and more content is now in English, 
rather than Swahili, leading to potential problems of incomplete comprehen-
sion. Whilst literacy in English is fairly high in Kenya, it is less so in Tanzania, 
so understanding of the message in English is more restricted there, so Swahili 
still has a role in ensuring better understanding. DVD s of sermons and sem-
inars which are sold outside mosques and churches are locally made; many 
of these are in Swahili, allowing the possibility that the message will be more 
clearly communicated.
Muslims and Christians living in the same place interact with each other, 
often with little or no difficulty, agreeing to disagree about matters of faith, or 
avoiding the subject. Many will have some knowledge of the other’s scripture, 
often mediated by tracts such as those examined in this volume.
However, the ways in which passages from the Bible and the Qurʾān are used 
in the tracts, and particularly when similarly used in preaching settings, can 
and do lead to increased tensions between Muslims and Christians. This has 
been seen in Kenya, where Ngariba and Kawemba were deported on ‘security 
grounds’ after they were invited to speak in Mombasa in 1987, as they were seen 
to be provoking Muslim agitation (Impact International, 1987: 5). In Tanzania 
they were also ordered out of Tanga region; later they were allowed to return 
and speak in mosques, but not outdoors (Chande, 1998: 153, 155).
Cecil Simbaulanga was arrested for ‘inflammatory preaching’ that insulted 
Islam, and stopped from speaking in Kigoma in 2006 (Tanzania Daima, 
22.08.2006).
These particular Muslim and Christian preachers also present their views in 
their tracts and these serve to increase disquiet amongst communities.
This disquiet has also been seen in Tanzania with unrest following demon-
strations as to who has the right to butcher animals, leading to the death of an 
Assemblies of God pastor in 2012 in Buseresere (Chesworth, 2017: 397–9).

Chapter 11
The continued dissemination of the ideas and approaches seen in much of 
the material examined in the book is likely to lead to increased community 
unrest and lack of harmony amongst the faith communities.
Tracts are ephemeral, by their very nature they are produced at minimal cost 
and tend to be printed on poor quality paper, meaning that they will not last 
long. Also, they can be regarded as being ‘grey literature’ not published with an 
ISBN and not appearing in library catalogues. With digitisation, increasingly 
such ephemeral material is being recorded and stored in electronic libraries, 
many with internet portals. This has several consequences for the reader and 
for the researcher. Hard to locate material is now more accessible for future 
research and PDF copies can easily be circulated by groups wishing to use 
these tracts.
Understanding the ways in which scripture in Swahili has been used in 
tracts, through the historical overview, together with the close examination 
of selected passages from the Bible and the Qurʾān used in the tracts, leads to 
an awareness that scripture is all too often interpreted to favour the writer’s 
arguments. With the rapid development of new media, the tracts examined, 
and those collected and listed in the bibliography, are rapidly disappearing 
from circulation as physical objects. However, as was seen with the on-line 
tract from Biblia ni Jibu, the approach used in the tracts examined, continues 
to feature in material circulating on the internet, through video streaming and 
in social media, as in the case of Cecil Simbaulanga. Whilst Mohamed Said, 
became more involved in writing academic articles. examining the history of 
events in Tanzania, using his website as a platform to inform others.
How to present the message of either faith within the East African con-
text remains a challenge. Lamin Sanneh, Translating the message, Hussein 
Abdul-Raof, Qur’an translation and Abdallah Saeed in The Qur’an: An 
Introduction all raise the issues of how to mediate the meaning and message of 
scripture within a specific linguistic and cultural setting. With the enormous 
changes in communication in recent years, through the internet and social 
media, this becomes an even greater challenge, when local and global increas-
ingly converge and conflict. Context becomes dynamic, leading to changes in 
language and culture, which means that mixed messages all too often result, 
with different generations having very different understanding of what is said. 
The move to electronic media was made evident during the course of the 
research, when a SIM card was purchased for the use of a visitor. The vendor 
decided that the purchaser was in need of spiritual guidance and signed up the 
mobile number to receive a daily Bible text; it could equally easily have been a 
passage from the Qurʾān. The messages being broadcast continue to be mixed.

Qurʾānic Passages
A selection of the passages which are discussed in the study is presented. Various 
Swahili versions of the Qurʾānic passages are given as well as the passages in English.
The English version of The Qurʾān (2004) [Haleem] is presented first, followed by: 
Qurani Takatifu [al-Farsy] (1969), as the most readily available Swahili version of the 
Qurʾān; Tafsiri ya Kurani ya Kiarabu [Dale] (1923); Kurani Tukufu [Aḥmadi] (1953); 
Tarjama ya Al-Muntakhab katika tafsiri ya Qur’ani tukufu Qur’ani Tukufu [Al-Barwani] 
(1995); Quran Tukufu [Mayunga] (2002); Al-Kashif [Mughniyya] (2002). This last one is 
incomplete; only the juzuu that have been published appear.
Note: Dale is not versified. Dale set his passages to have the same pagination as a 
readily available Arabic Qurʾān (Dale, 1924: 9). The Aḥmadi version includes versifica-

Those who say, ‘God is the Messiah, son of Mary,’ have defied God. The Messiah 
himself said, ‘Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.’ If any-
one associates others with God, God will forbid him from the Garden, and Hell 
will be his home. No one will help such evildoers.
73	
Those people who say that God is the third of three are defying [the truth]: 
there is only One God. If they persist in what they are saying, a painful punish-
ment will afflict those of them who persist.
74	
Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness, when God is most forgiv-
ing, most merciful?

The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger; other messengers had come 
and gone before him; his mother was a virtuous woman; both ate food [like 
other mortals]. See how clear We make these signs for them; see how deluded

Bila ya shaka wamekufuru wale waliosema, “Mwenyezi Mungu ni Masihi 
(Isa) bin Maryamu.” Na (hali ya kuwa) Masihi alisema: “Enyi wana wa Israili! 
Mwabuduni Mwenyezi Mungu, Mola wangu na Mola wenu. Kwani anayem-
shirikisha Mwenyezi Mungu, hakika Mwenyezi Mungu atamharimishia Pepo, 
na mahali pake (patakuwa) ni Motoni na madhalimu hawatakuwa na wasaidizi

Bila shaka watu wale wasemao ya kuwa Mungu ni Masihi mwana wa Mariamu 
wamekufuru: kwa maana Masihi alisema, Enyi wana wa Israeli, mwabuduni 
Mungu, Bwana wangu na Bwana wenu: mtu aliye yote atakaempa Mungu 
mshirika, Mungu atamharamishia Bustani, na moto utakuwa kao lake, wala 
hapana wasaidizi kwao wenye kudhulumu. Wao wasemao ya kuwa Mungu ni 
watatu wa watatu wamekwisha kukufuru. Hapana Mungu illa Mungu mmoja; 
nao wasipo acha kusema wasemavyo, hakika yake adhabu kali itawapata wale 
miongoni mwao walio makafiri. Je! hawatatubu na kumwelekea Mungu na 
kumwomba ghofira? Maana Mungu ni mwenye ghofira na mwenye rehema. 
Masihi, mwana wa Mariamu, ni mtume tu, mitume wengine wamemtangulia: 
na mama yake alikuwa msema kweli: wote wawili walikula chakula. Tazama 
jinsi tunavyowadhihirishia ishara zetu: kiisha tazama jinsi wanavyogeuka 
upande. Sema, Je! Mnataka kuabudu pamoja na Mungu kitu kisichoweza kud-
huru wala kusaidia? Lakini Mungu anasikia, anajua.

Appendix 2
WE ARE CONSTANT1 READERS of various articles2 prepared by believers of Christian 
denominations. Some of these articles are:-
(1)	ISA (JESUS) IN THE QURAN AND THE BIBLE, which is distributed by the 
Christian Council of Tanzania, P.O. Box 696, MOROGORO3
(2)	Alhidayat (Guidance)4
GUIDELINES FOR TRUTH, P.O. Box 28963, NAIROBI5
(3)	Articles prepared by MAKUMIRA THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE6 P.O. Box 55 
USA-RIVER ARUSHA
FOR THE PRESENT WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER some of the many questions that we 
have been asked by our researchers/enquirers.7 And in answering, as usual, we will use 
evidence from within the Bible8 and by God’s9 ability in forthcoming issues10 we will 
deal with the accumulation11 of questions that we have been asked.
GOD IS ONLY ONE.12 Evidence from (1) The Old Testament:-
GENESIS 1:1; DEUTERONOMY 5:7, 4:35; EXODUS 20:3; ISAIAH 44:6, 45:5, 43:10–11; 
HOSEA 13:4; PSALMS 83:18, 81:9, 18:32.
1	 	
Kudumu – remain, continue, endure, last, abide; from daima Adv. – constantly.
2	 	
Makala – Possible meanings – article, treatise, piece of writing.
3	 	
This document is actually distributed by Tanzania Evangelical Literature Ministry 
(T.E.L.M.) P.O. Box 1009 Morogoro, Tanzania – This group is associated with the Christian 
Council of Tanzania and the now defunct writing unit. See Chapter 7, pp. 130–7.
4	 	
Arabic not Swahili. The meaning would be readily understood by Muslims in East Africa.
5	 	
The address is that of Evangel Publishing. The present General Manager knows nothing 
about Alhidayat. Evangel does print for other groups including Njia ya Uzima.
6	 	
This refers to the Lutheran Theological College at Makumira, now part of Tumaini (Hope) 
University. What specific articles are referred to here has not been determined. The 
College has published Africa Theological Journal for many years; more recently, in 1993, it 
started publishing Jarida la Kichungaji (Pastoral Journal) in Swahili. In his Introduction, 
Drønen relates his reception on arrival at Makumira (1995: 7): being questioned sharply 
by a student as to who he was and what he was doing and then being apologised to: ‘We 
are afraid of Muslims who are trying to undermine our college’.
7	 	
Watayarishaji – literally – they who prepare. To translate this as ‘preparers’ does not make 
sense. The context seems to imply either those doing research on the subject or, possibly, 
enquirers.
8	 	
The Swahili version of the Bible most likely to have been used by the authors is Biblia, 
Maandiko Matakatifu Union Version, published by the Bible Society of Tanzania.
9	 	
Mola – Allah, Lord (God), God – from Arabic mawlā – God. Elsewhere in the Document, 
the more usual form of Mungu is used. Mola is more often used by Muslims, than 
Christians or Traditionalists (Johnson, 1939: 295). Possibly this is an attempt to differenti-
ate between the Muslim God and the Christian God.
10		
This phrase also appears in the Warsha statement about Sofia Kawawa. ‘By the will of 
Allah, in the forthcoming issues we shall deal with …’ (Warsha, 1988: 39).
11		
Mlundikano – from rundika or lundika – to accumulate.
12		
With the meaning ‘One God’. Ngariba and Kawemba use this as a heading in their booklet 
(1997: 3).

EPHESIANS 4:4–7; 1 CORINTHIANS 8:4–5.
WARNING AGAINST ASSOCIATING14 God, he who has no likeness with anything else:
EXODUS 20:4; LEVITICUS 26:1; DEUTERONOMY 4:15–20; ISAIAH 44:9–20; 
ROMANS 1:23; PSALM 97:7. Paul15 teaches the trinity16 2 CORINTHIANS 13:14.17
JESUS IS A MESSENGER:18
HEBREWS 12:24; 9:15; 3:1–4; JOHN 17:3; 4:42, 4:19, 4:34, 5:36, 5:42, 5:17,

50, 8:26, 17:18; HEBREWS 3:1
JESUS DENIES THAT HE IS CALLED CHRIST:19 MATTHEW 16:20, 24:4; LUKE 9:18
PAUL TEACHES people that Jesus is indeed the Christ: ACTS 18:5–6, 9:22, 17:3.
PAUL STARTED20 the religion of Christianity there in Antioch and not in Jerusalem – 
ACTS 11:26.
PAUL WAS NOT an apostle21 nor a disciple22 of Jesus – ACTS 9:26
PAUL WAS a great enemy of Jesus – ACTS 26:9–12.
THE NAMES AND NUMBER of the disciples of Jesus – MATTHEW 10:2–4
13		
Injili – literally the Gospel, from the Greek euangelizō but Swahili usage gives it the mean-
ing of New Testament according to both Johnson (1939: 143) and Bosha (1993: 112), how-
ever Khamisi (1981: 85) gives its meaning as Gospel.
14		
Kumshirikisha – literally – give a share to him, but implies ‘to associate with’. Possible 
alternative translation WARNING AGAINST GIVING. Shirk – associating, this is the worst 
sin of Islam. “There is no difference between him who worships an idol and him who 
worships Christ or any other; the word shirk signifies nothing other than the man giving 
himself someone to worship in addition to God”, Gimaret (1997: 485) quoting al-Rāzī.
	
	
All the verses listed here concerning associating are warnings against idols and worship-
ping them. It is not being used to attack the Christian understanding of Jesus. However, it 
may be an attack on the statues found in the Roman Catholic Churches in Tanzania.
15		
Paul is named 30 times in the Document.
16		
Utatu – trinity, being triple, threefoldness, from Tatu – three (Johnson, 1939: 457).
17		
This is the formulation used for the Grace in Christian Worship. Each member of the Holy 
Trinity is named.
18		
Mtume – literally - one who is sent, more usually translated as Apostle, but here to fit in 
with the Islamic view of Jesus, Messenger is more appropriate. Swahili uses mtume with 
Muḥammad rather than the Arabic rasūl. Frankl and Omar discuss this use of Mtume for 
Muḥammad (1999:110).
19		
The text actually says: JESUS DENIES THAT HE IS NOT CALLED CHRIST. Double nega-
tives are not usually used in Swahili; they often cause confusion for Swahili speakers using 
English and vice-versa. This could indicate that this part of the Document was in fact 
translated from another language, in a rather too literal way.
20		
It is written in the present tense STARTS.
21		
mtume translated here as apostle rather than messenger.
22		
mwanafunzi – literally student or pupil but in relation to Jesus translated as disciple.

Appendix 2
HOW THE JEWS understood Paul – ACTS 24:5
THE TRIBE23 of Paul is Roman ACTS 22:23–29
PAUL SAYS that he does not deserve to be called an Apostle – 1 CORINTHIANS 15:9.
LATER Paul claims that he was given his apostleship by Jesus when24 Jesus had already 
departed ACTS 22:6–9, compare with ACTS 9:3–9
PAUL SAYS he does so through the temerity of boasting25 – 2 CORINTHIANS 11:16–17.
23		
kabila – usually translated as tribe or clan; in this case the fact that Paul is a Roman citizen 
is referred to. The Bible Reference quoted uses Mrumi, a form which could imply tribal 
affiliation or citizenship. E.g. A member of the Gogo people would be called Mgogo, a 
Tanzanian – Mtanzania. In verse 28 of Acts chapter 9 when referring to the citizenship of 
the Tribune the Swahili uses wenyeji huu – this citizenship. The Greek text uses Rōmaīos – 
Roman, which is translated Mrumi, and politeia – citizenship, which is translated wenyeji.
24		
wakati – literally means time but it seems to be being consistently used here to give the 
meaning – when.
25		
Quoted almost directly from 2 Corinthians 11:17b “katika ujasiri wa kujisifu”.

PAUL ALSO casts out spirits27 – ACTS 16:18
INDEED PAUL is he whom Jesus foretold would come to cast out spirits and Jesus will 
reject him MATTHEW 7:22
PAUL SAYS his Testament (The New Testament) does not come from God but on the 
contrary it is of humankind only, GALATIANS 3:15, reconcile this with the account of 
Jesus28 MATTHEW 15:8–9.
Likewise in GALATIANS 5:7–9 Paul says that his teaching does not come from the Lord 
(God).29 Paul says that he did not come to teach the truth 1 CORINTHIANS 2:1–2, Paul 
says that it would be better to die rather than cause his boasting to be invalid
[1] CORINTHIANS 9:15.30
JESUS SAYS that he did not come to refute the Torah31 rather to fulfil it MATTHEW 
5:17–19, BUT Paul rejects the Torah – ROMANS 7:6; GALATIANS 3:23–25,
Luke and Mark are servants (followers)32 of Paul PHILEMON 1:23–24;
2 TIMOTHY 4:11–12. The Laws that were given to all the Prophets is the Torah –

Page numbers are placed centrally at the top of pages 2–5 in the Document.
27		
Pepo – refers to disembodied spirits, -wema – good, -baya – bad. Different from, roho – 
spirit or life, as Roho Mtakatifu – Holy Spirit (see below).
28		
Ngariba and Kawemba (1987: 10) also use these two Bible references together, linking 
them with, “Now let us see what Jesus says and compare this with Paul’s teachings”.
29		
Mungu is used here for God, rather than Mola.
30		
Ngariba and Kawemba (1987: 10) interpret this verse saying “In other words Paul confesses 
that he does not speak on the authority of Jesus, and that he is motivated by boastfulness 
and self-glorification”.
31		
Taurati – the Torah, the Mosaic Books of Law, the Pentateuch, from the Arabic tawrāt.
32		
Wahudumu – servants, from the Arabic khadam – servant or attendant (Bosha, 1993: 90) 
rather than the more commonly used watumishi – servants, from tuma – to employ, send, 
(hence one sent, directed, a servant) the same root as mtume. Wafuasi – followers, adher-
ents, disciples (Johnson, 1939: 99).
33		
Ngariba and Kawemba (1987:26) use this verse to show that God’s word has been changed.
34		
Adamu – translated here as Adam, can also be understood as man. Mwanadamu – human 
being, is formed from a contraction of Mwana wa Adamu.
35		
Holy – Mtakatifu – Frankl and Omar argue that the word takatifu is a Christian Missionary 
construct developed in the 19th Century for the concept of ‘holy’. Bishop Steere used it to 
translate the Hebrew qāḏôš in Isaiah 6:3 ‘Holy, holy, holy’. It has also been adopted by 
Muslims, when translating the Qurʾān, for the Arabic al-Qudus (1999: 109–113). See above, 
pp. 79–81.
36		
The Qurʾānic understanding of the Angel Gabriel is as the carrier of messages from God 
to His Messengers.

WORK: The Reconciler between God and the Prophets 1 JOHN 4:13, 2 CHRONICLES 15:1; 
MATTHEW 12:18, 12:28; 1 CORINTHIANS 12:4–11; LUKE 3:21–22.
THEREFORE THE HOLY SPIRIT cannot possibly be God – ROMANS 1:20–23; 
ECCLESIASTES 12:7, 3:21; NUMBERS 16:22; JOB 12:10; ISAIAH 57:16; REVELATION 22:6.
THE HOLY Spirit dwells within all prophets 1 JOHN 4:12–13, 4:1; JOHN 16:7–14.
The Word Father is God – MATTHEW 23:9; JOHN 20:17; GENESIS 1:1
Jesus is not that word37 that is mentioned in JOHN 1:1, as Jesus himself denied it in 
JOHN 17:6–8, 15:3, 14:24.
RATHER THIS WORD is the word38 “There is no god but God”39 DEUTERONOMY 5:7; 1 
PETER 1:25, 2 PETER 1:19–21; ISAIAH 40:8.
GOD creates by a word JAMES 1:18
WE LIVE, we move40 because of [the ability of] God – ACTS 17:27–28
THE WORD OF GOD is sharp like a sword and it has great strength – HEBREWS 4:12, 
JEREMIAH 23:29.
CHILDREN OF GOD in the Bible:-
(1) All believers are the children of God – JOHN 1:12
(2) All the Apostles are the children of God – EXODUS 4:22
37		
Neno – Word, used in John 1.1 to translate the Greek logos which John uses to express the 
concept of God’s thought or self-expression, inseparable from God and understood by 
Christians to be Jesus Christ.
38		
kalima – word – from the Arabic, this is a very rare form in Swahili (Bosha, 1993: 123). It 
is used to refer to the Muslim credal statement, the Shahāda. It can also be seen as being 
used to differentiate it from Neno – word, which is used to translate and stand for the 
Greek logos.
39		
The opening phrase of the Shahāda in transliterated Arabic ‘Laa ilaaha illa-llaahu’. This 
is similar to the way that it is transliterated in Mafundisho ya Qur’an: Shahada “Lailaha 
illa-llah” (Warsha, 1982: 16).
	
	
The formal transliteration is ‘lā ilāha illāʾllāh’ (Gimaret, 1997: 486).
40		
This closely follows Acts 17:28a ‘Kwa maana ndani yake yeye tunaishi, tunakwenda na kuwa 
na uhai wetu.’ From Paul’s speech/sermon in the Areopagus in Athens, where he is quot-
ing Epimenides the Cretan (RSV margin).

(3) Men and women are the children of God – 2 CORINTHIANS 6:[1]8
(4) The Companions are also the children of God – 1 JOHN 3:1
(5) Judges and lawyers are the children of God – PSALM 82:641
(6) The Prophet David is a child of God – PSALM 89:26–27
(7) The Prophet Solomon is a child of God – [1] CHRONICLES 22:10
(8) Continue to read: JOHN 8:42, 20:17; MATTHEW 5:9, 1 TIMOTHY 2:5.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORSHIP (TO PRAY)
First is to perform ceremonial ablutions42 – EXODUS 17:21,43 JOHN 2:6–7, 13:4–15.
Secondly, is to remove shoes before entering into a place44 of worship. Moses removed 
his shoes at the time of prayer – EXODUS 3:3–5; ACTS 7:33.
Joshua also removed his shoes before praying – JOSHUA 5:15
Thirdly, is to begin the prayer itself. HOW DID PEOPLE PRAY?
Moses prayed by prostrating himself – EXODUS 34:8
JESUS prayed by prostrating himself as the Prophet Moses prayed – MATTHEW 26:38–
39; 1 CORINTHIANS 14:24–25. The Children of Israel prayed by prostrating themselves –
[2] CHRONICLES 7:3. Likewise the Children of Israel will have the mark of prayer45 on 
their foreheads REVELATION 7:3–4.
The Disciples of Jesus prayed by bowing and prostrating themselves – MATTHEW 17:6. 
Those with the mark of prayer on their foreheads were saved from being killed by the 
scorpion’s sting – REVELATION 9:1–9
HOW MANY TIMES IS PRAYER prayed in a day?
It is prayed five times. Dawn,46 Noon, Afternoon, Evening and Night –47
PSALM 55:17; 1 SAMUEL 1:19; GENESIS 19:27; ACTS 3:1
All the Prophets prayed in the same way.
41		
This reference does not appear to have any relevance to Judges and Lawyers being the 
Children of God.
42		
kutawaza is an alternative spelling for the more usual kutawadha from the Arabic tawad-
duʾ. kutawaza also has the meaning of – cause to rule from tawala. This is an example of 
the problem of inconsistency in the transliteration of Arabic words into Swahili, with 
alternatives for the Arabic letter zāʾ being dh and z.
43		
This reference does not exist, Chapter 17 only has 16 verses. The correct reference has not 
been definitely identified. It could well be Exodus 30:17–21, which refers to such ablutions.
44		
nyumba ya ibada – literally house of worship – but place of worship gives a clearer sense.
45		
The word translated here as ‘mark of prayer’ sijida literally means prostration in Islamic 
Prayer. Arabic sajda – prostration in prayer. The mark is caused by the repeated touching 
of the forehead on the ground during prostrations. The Bible verse refers to a ‘Seal of God 
on their foreheads’, ‘muhuri … wa Mungu wetu juu ya vipaji vya nyuso zao’ Revelation 7:3b.
46		
Asubuhi actually means morning, Alfajiri would more correctly be used for dawn, but the 
sense of dawn as it refers to the time of prayer.
47		
In Swahili the times of day in normal use are those used to indicate the times of prayer 
and are Arabic in origin.

2 CHRONICLES 7:3; REVELATION 22:8–9; DANIEL 8:17–18; 1 KINGS 18:39–40; EZRA 10:1; 
NEHEMIAH 8:6; GENESIS 17:13, 48:12.
ALL THE PROPHETS fasted the fast together with their people –
1 KINGS 19:8; NEHEMIAH 1:4; JEREMIAH 36:6, 9; JONAH 3:5. Jesus prayed and 
fasted – MATTHEW 17:2. Likewise he taught his disciples to pray and to fast – 
MATTHEW 6:16–18, 4:2; LUKE 5:35. Even Paul taught people that they should fast and 
pray48 – 1 CORINTHIANS 7:5.
Jesus has taught that to fast is indeed the way of righteousness – MATTHEW 7:13.
PAUL TEACHES that Jesus is the Great God – TITUS 2:13–14,49 but Jesus refuted this 
claim of Paul – JOHN 14:28, 13:16–17.
The Prophet David also refuted this claim of Paul – PSALM 77:13–14.
WOMEN who have not reached 60 years of age are not permitted to be religious50 
(sisters)51 or to preach – 1 TIMOTHY 5:9–12.
To wear a cross around the neck52 is to test God – ACTS 15:9–11, 1 TIMOTHY 6:1–2.
48		
Kuomba is used here rather than kusali, but the sense is the same. It may be deliberate 
to differentiate Paul from the Prophets, especially as he is regularly condemned in the 
remainder of the text. Sali/sala is usually used for Liturgical or formal prayer, whilst ombi/
omba is used for extempore prayer.
49		
Ngariba and Kawemba quote Titus 2:13–14, then say ‘If Paul is calling Jesus “great God” 
then how will he call his Father in Heaven?’ (1987: 9).
50		
watawa has a variety of meanings but the sense is: one who has withdrawn from life, 
literally indoors; it is usually used to refer to Nuns or Novitiates.
51		
masista is an English loan word used to refer to Sisters in the religious sense, usually Nuns 
but also used for any single lady working in the Church, lay workers etc. ma- is a prefix to 
make it plural: many loan words take the ji-, ma- class in the noun form.
52		
Presumably this refers to the wearing of crosses on necklaces by Christians or the wearing 
of pectoral crosses by senior clergy.

instruments were the traditional instruments of the Israelites to proclaim66 celebra-
tions JEREMIAH 31:7; ISAIAH 12:5. The Lord Jesus prohibited worship consisting of 
senseless chatter MATTHEW 6:5–13.
Up to this point we have seen how Jesus worshipped God. Therefore for any person 
who truly truly67 follows Jesus it is essential that he68 performs ceremonial ablutions, 
he should remove his shoes before entering a place of worship, when he prays he prays 
by bowing and prostration. Likewise it is necessary that he should fast (fasting). This is 
indeed how Jesus performed69 worship and all the prophets they performed worship 
like this and in this manner.
Therefore sung WORSHIP in churches, to play guitars and pianos, to cry out, to 
talk foolishly, to enter into places of worship with shoes that are covered with dirt 
(impure/unclean)70 of all kinds, to pray with men and women seated71 together etc. 
is an arrangement that the Apostle Isa72 (Jesus) Son of Mary did not teach. But these 
services were taught by that founder of the religion of Christianity who is called PAUL 
in his policy of boasting.
THIS IS INDEED THE REASON that the arrangement of this religion of Paul is 
totally different from that which was taught by the Apostle Jesus and all the other 
Apostles that is ISLAM.

ALMIGHTY GOD said to the Messenger (p.b.u.h.) in the Qurʾān 3:8473 “Say: We have 
believed Almighty God and that which we have been sent down and that which was 
sent down to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and his children and that 
which he gave Moses and Jesus and other Prophets from their God. We do not discrim-
inate between them at all and we submit to Him.”74
Likewise Almighty God says in Qurʾān 42:13 that “He gave you the Law of that religion 
that he commended to Noah, and that which we revealed to you, and we commended75 
them to Abraham and Moses and Jesus …
AFTER UNDERSTANDING this truth it is up to you to decide to worship Almighty 
God as he ordered or you should decide to follow your own desires for the sake of 
worldly benefits only.
FOR ANYONE that is able to read and understand the Bible well it is necessary that 
he should abandon the perverse faith of following the teaching of Paul.
He should abandon the faith that is concerned with the humiliation of the cross and 
falsely charging that Jesus was killed on the cross for the following reasons:-
(1) For the glory that the Apostle Jesus had among them it is not possible to be cursed 
as Paul claimed: see76 DEUTERONOMY 21:22–23.
(2) Jesus himself did not want to be killed on the cross therefore he asked Almighty 
God that he should take this trouble from him – MATTHEW 26:39;77 MARK 14:36; 
LUKE 22:42.
(3) The supplication of Jesus was agreed to by God, therefore Jesus was not crucified 
PSALMS 43:5, 42:6–10, 6:3–10, 31:5–8, 13–15, 18:1–9; MATTHEW 26:36–39; JOHN 1:5, 12:27–
28; HEBREWS 5:7; LUKE 23:44.
73		
The references from the Qur’ān appear to be from a Swahili version Qurani Takatifu 
(al-Farsy, 1969: 83, 604), with slight changes.
74		
This quotation from the Qurani Takatifu is exact, except two words, wake and wengine, 
which appear in brackets in the original, indicating that they are not actually in the 
Qurʾān.
75		
tuliyomuhusia – in Qurani Takatifu it says tuliyowausia, the -wa- infix refers to the Third 
Person plural – them, whereas the -mu- infix is Third Person singular – he. Dale uses tuli-
yomwamuru, using Third Person singular (1923: 437). Ahmadi uses tuliyowausia, Third 
Person plural (Ahmadi, 1953: 42:14). In his 1995 edition al-Barwani uses tulivyo agana – as 
we came to terms with, avoiding an infix (1995: 42:13), however in the 2000 edition, this is 
changed to tuliyo wausia, agreeing with al-Farsy, though separating it into two words.
76		
kwenye – in. Translated as ‘see’ as ‘in’ implies incorrectly that Paul wrote Deuteronomy.
77		
Thomas (1996:31) refers to this text as being a favourite text used by early Muslim polem-
icists, showing the ‘great divide between Jesus and God’.

(4) Those who claim that Jesus was crucified only follow a notion and they do not have 
any proof of this thing – JOHN 19:14–18 – Jesus was crucified at six o’clock.78
	
MARK 15:25 – ”    ”    ”   three o’clock.
	
MATTHEW 27:46 – ”    ”   ”   nine o’clock.
Who is the Jesus that was crucified at three different times?
GALATIANS 3:1 – Jesus was not crucified.
Paul boasted in GALATIANS 3:15 that although he teaches about the human 
Testament it has already been proved to you that without authority there is no one to 
nullify it.
We should not forget the warning that is in COLOSSIANS 2:23 that worship that you 
yourselves have put together79 is not worth a thing.80
JESUS warns in ACTS 24:1481 that God is worshipped in heretical ways. When he 
admits in 1 CORINTHIANS 2:1–2 that “When I came to you I did not come to teach the 
truth”.82
THEREFORE it is up to you to decide to follow the true religion of Almighty God 
that was taught by the Apostle Jesus and the other Apostles, that is ISLAM, or to follow 
the religion of Paul (Christianity), when the founder himself admitted that he did not 
come to teach the truth.
Have you decided to obey Almighty God or to follow your own desires and to be a 
follower of Paul?

Times in Swahili start from dawn. The times mentioned are saa sita (6 o’clock) = 12.00 
midday, saa tatu (3 o’clock) = 9.00 am, saa tisa (9 o’clock) = 3.00 pm.

munayojitungia – Second Person plural reflexive with -yo- Possessive infix, could be trans-
lated as:- constructed, composed or put together.
80		
haifai kitu – not worth a thing/is of no use/is of no benefit.
81		
The passage in Acts actually has Paul speaking in his own defence before the governor 
Felix, prior to being sent to Rome to state his case before the Emperor; it is clearly not a 
reference to Jesus speaking. The passage in the Union Version refers to the Njia (Way); as 
does RSV, Greek hodon – Way – meaning the followers of Christ. The Way is called a her-
esy by others. Union Version uzushi (heresy), RSV has ‘sect’, Greek airesin – religious party, 
false party/teaching. The Union Version lends support for the reading ‘heresy’/‘heretical 
group’.

This is an inaccurate quotation of 1 Corinthians 2:1b ‘mimi nilipokuja kwenu, sikuja niwa-
hubiri siri ya Mungu….’
