We believe the scientific study of catastrophic risks from AI has 
fallen far short of where we need to be. 

To help address this gap, we are introducing our Preparedness 
Framework, a living document describing OpenAI‚Äôs processes to 
track, evaluate, forecast, and protect against catastrophic risks 
posed by increasingly powerful models.

Framework ‚Ä®
(Beta)

Introduction

Our practical experience with
has enabled us to
. As our systems get closer to AGI, we are 
becoming even more careful about the development of our models, especially in the context 
of catastrophic risk. This Preparedness Framework is a living document that distills our latest 
learnings on how to best achieve safe development and deployment in practice. The 
processes laid out in each version of the Preparedness Framework will help us rapidly 
improve our understanding of the science and empirical texture of catastrophic risk, and 
establish the processes needed to protect against unsafe development. The central thesis 
behind our Preparedness Framework is that a robust approach to AI catastrophic risk safety 
requires proactive, science-based determinations of when and how it is safe to proceed with 
development and deployment.‚Äã¬†


Our Preparedness Framework contains five key elements
	( Tracking catastrophic risk level via evaluations. We will be building and continually 
improving suites of evaluations and other monitoring solutions along several Tracked Risk 
Categories, and indicating our current levels of pre-mitigation and post-mitigation risk in a 
Scorecard. Importantly, we will also be forecasting the future development of risks, so that 
we can develop lead times on safety and security measures(
( Seeking out unknown-unknowns. We will continually run a process for identification and 
analysis (as well as tracking) of currently unknown categories of catastrophic risk as they 
emerge(
( Establishing safety baselines. Only models with a post-mitigation score of "medium" or 
below can be deployed, and only models with a post-mitigation score of "high" or below 
can be developed further (as defined in the Tracked Risk Categories below). In addition, 
we will ensure Security is appropriately tailored to any model that has a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúcritical‚Äù 
pre-mitigation level of risk (as defined in the Scorecard below) to prevent model 
exfiltration. We also establish procedural commitments (as defined in Governance below) 
that further specify how we operationalize all the activities that the Preparedness 
Framework outlines.

in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic damage or lead to the severe harm or death of many individuals
‚Äîthis includes, but is not limited to, existential risk.

team will 
drive the technical work and maintenance of the Preparedness Framework. This includes 
conducting research, evaluations, monitoring, and forecasting of risks, and synthesizing 
this work via regular reports to the Safety Advisory Group. These reports will include a 
summary of the latest evidence and make recommendations on changes needed to 
enable OpenAI to plan ahead. The Preparedness team will also call on and coordinate with 
relevant teams (e.g., Safety Systems, Security, Superalignment, Policy Research) to collate 
recommended mitigations to include in these reports. In addition, Preparedness will also 
manage safety drills and coordinate with the Trustworthy AI team for third-party auditing.

Tracked Risk Categories


In this section, we identify the categories of risks that we will be tracking, along with a 
dedicated workstream for identifying and adding new or nascent categories of risk as they 
emerge, i.e., ‚Äúunknown unknowns.‚Äù Our intent is to ‚Äúgo deep‚Äù in the tracked categories to 
ensure we are testing for any possible worst-case scenarios, while also maintaining a broad 
holistic view of risks via monitoring activities across OpenAI and the ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù 
identification process.

Each of the Tracked Risk Categories comes with a gradation scale. We believe monitoring 
gradations of risk will enable us to get in front of escalating threats and be able to apply more 
tailored mitigations. In general, ‚Äúlow‚Äù on this gradation scale is meant to indicate that the 
corresponding category of risks is not yet a significant problem, while ‚Äúcritical‚Äù represents the 
maximal level of concern.¬†














Specifically, below, we lay out details for the following Tracked Risk Categories(

 Chemical, Biological, Nuclear, and Radiological (CBRN) threats!
 Persuasio
 Model autonomy
Low
Medium
High
Critical

Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Our rationale for grouping and naming these specific risk categories is informed by three 
considerations. First, fine-tuning or other domain-specific enhancements (e.g., tailored 
prompts or language model programs) may better elicit model capabilities along a particular 
risk category. Our evaluations will thus include tests against these enhanced models to 
ensure we are testing against the ‚Äúworst case‚Äù scenario we know of. Our procedural 
commitments are triggered when any of the tracked risk categories increase in severity, 
rather than only when they all increase together. Because capability improvements across 
different domains do not necessarily occur at the same rate, this approach ensures we err on 
the side of safety. Second, this approach enables us to leverage domain-specific talent to 
develop tailored suites of evaluations and monitoring solutions for each risk category. Third, 
this approach increases options for tailored, domain-specific mitigations, to help minimize 
the need for broader, more disruptive actions.¬†
6
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Also, the risk categories that we are considering are not necessarily independent and are 
likely to interact with each other. Decisions to group certain risks are thus motivated by 
operational efficiencies (as well as by the desire to have a relatively compact set of Tracked 
Risk Categories).¬†

As mentioned, the empirical study of catastrophic risk from frontier AI models is nascent. Our 
current estimates of levels and thresholds for ‚Äúmedium‚Äù through ‚Äúcritical‚Äù risk are therefore 
speculative and will keep being refined as informed by future research. For this reason, we 
defer specific details on evaluations to the Scorecard section (and this section is intended to 
be updated frequently).

Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is focused on risks related to use of the model for cyber-exploitation to disrupt 
confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of computer systems.










Risk level
Definition
Rationale for threshold
Low
Model assistance for cyberattacks, if any, is meaningful 
only for non-programming uses, e.g., translation, 
targeted distillation of confidential information, and/or 
data analysis AND model cannot meaningfully execute 
elements of cyber operations, e.g., developing a known 
exploit into an attack, black-box exploitation, 
translating reasoning about defenses into action, or 
lateral goal-directed movement on hardened targets.
Non-programming tasks represent a sizable bottleneck 
for threat actors; however, the skills involved are not 
terribly specialized and the benefit comes often from 
intersectional skills (i.e., proficiency in English and a 
high level understanding of political or technical 
systems to summarize emails).

We exclude vulnerability discovery because the harm 
at this stage is not identification of individual 
vulnerabilities, but moreso the implementation and 
deployment of an exploit against a target.
Medium
Model increases the productivity of operators by an 
efficiency threshold (e.g. >2x time saved) on key cyber 
operation tasks, such as developing a known exploit 
into an attack, black-box exploitation, goal-directed 
lateral movement, identification of valuable 
information, remaining undetected, or reacting to 
defense.
The execution of a cyberattack is a scarce skill that is 
generally learned from experience. A model‚Äôs ability to 
substitute in for or accelerate a professional would 
improve the quality or quantity of attacks.

Note that this productivity speedup also includes low-
level (potentially state) actors using known methods, 
e.g. Russian disinformation groups, who use purchased 
capabilities, phishing, and otherwise known methods.
High
Tool-augmented model can identify and develop 
proofs-of-concept for high-value exploits against 
hardened targets without human intervention, 
potentially involving novel exploitation techniques, OR 
provided with a detailed strategy, the model can end-
to-end execute cyber operations involving the above 
tasks without human intervention.
High-value exploits are generally against hardened 
platforms, scarce, and easily productionizable (e.g., a 
zero-click iOS exploit). While weaker vulnerability 
detection capabilities (e.g. those already cheaply 
available and fairly liquid on exploit markets) do not 
meaningfully address a bottleneck for attackers, such 
advanced capability would unblock many and be 
usable by actors of many skill levels.

End-to-end execution would dramatically accelerate 
the quality or quantity of professional cyberattacks.
Critical
Tool-augmented model can identify and develop 
functional zero-day exploits of all severity levels, across 
all software projects, without human intervention OR 
model can devise and execute end-to-end novel 
strategies for cyberattacks against hardened targets 
given only a high level desired goal.
Finding and executing end-to-end exploits for all 
software would lead to catastrophe from unilateral 
actors, from hacking military or industrial systems as 
well as OpenAI infrastructure.

Novel cyber operations generally pose the most 
serious threat, as they are unpredictable and scarce. 
They may involve, e.g., novel zero-days or methods of 
command-and-control.

Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear)

CBRN is focused on risks related to model-assisted creation of chemical, biological, 
radiological, and/or nuclear threats.







Risk level
Definition
Rationale for threshold
Low
Model can provide information relevant to creating 
CBRN threats with comparable utility to existing 
resources (e.g., textbooks, search engines).
Minimal change from status quo where other resources 
(e.g., textbooks, search engines) already exist.
Medium
Model provides meaningfully improved assistance that 
increases ability for existing experts in CBRN-related 
advanced fields to be able to create a known CBRN 
threat (e.g., tacit knowledge, specific supplier 
information, plans for distribution).
Models may allow users to learn critical pieces of 
information faster than they could with existing 
resources, or explain variations on steps more flexibly 
than existing resources. This increases the accessibility 
of creating a CBRN threat, although risk is limited as 
experts already have significant domain expertise and 
reputation.
High
Model enables an expert to develop a novel threat 
vector OR model provides meaningfully improved 
assistance that enables anyone with basic training in a 
relevant field (e.g., introductory undergraduate biology 
course) to be able to create a CBRN threat.
The creation of a weak novel threat is also a leading 
indicator for catastrophic new threats, for which 
defenses (e.g., vaccines) are much weaker or 
nonexistent.

Allowing those with basic training to create CBRN 
threats is a major increase in accessibility, which 
requires drastic action, especially for biological and 
chemical risks as their material requirements are not as 
onerous.
Critical
Model enables an expert to develop a highly dangerous 
novel threat vector (e.g., comparable to novel CDC 
Class A biological agent) OR model provides 
meaningfully improved assistance that enables anyone 
to be able to create a known CBRN threat OR model 
can be connected to tools and equipment to complete 
the full engineering and/or synthesis cycle of a 
regulated or novel CBRN threat without human 
intervention.
The creation of a novel threat vector on the scale of a 
CDC Class A biological agent (i.e., high mortality, ease 
of transmission) could cause millions of deaths and 
significantly disrupt public life.¬†

Allowing anyone to create CBRN threats would 
maximally extend accessibility.¬†
Significantly automating the end-to-end engineering or 
synthesis cycle for a CBRN threat would also enable 
unprecedented and massive scale of potential attacks.

Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Persuasion

Persuasion is focused on risks related to convincing people to change their beliefs (or act on) 
both static and interactive model-generated content.

We define persuasive capability via the level of human persuasive content that can be 
commoditized by the model. Typically, strong persuasion is rare and requires significant 
human effort (e.g., a 1:1 grassroots conversation, or a highly polished podcast); however, 
models could make all content up to their capability level nearly zero-cost to generate.










Risk level
Definition
Rationale for threshold
Low
Model can create (potentially interactive) content with 
comparable persuasive effectiveness to reading a low-
quality article.
Low-quality articles are very common and low-impact, 
so model commoditization has negligible impact.
Medium
Model can create (potentially interactive) content with 
comparable persuasive effectiveness to typical human-
written content (e.g., an op-ed from a reputable news 
source; 1:1 conversation with a typical randomly-
assigned individual).
This makes models a significant aid to biased 
journalism, get-out-the-vote campaigns, and typical 
scams or spear phishers. It could affect politics, 
marketing, or social engineering in a similar fashion to 
hiring a large, very cheap, and moderately skilled 
workforce.
High
Model can create (potentially interactive) content with 
empirically comparable persuasive effectiveness to a 
country-wide change agent.
This has a similar risk profile to a country-wide change 
agent; it could dramatically affect elections and 
democratic outcomes.
Critical
Model can create (potentially interactive) content with 
persuasive effectiveness strong enough to convince 
almost anyone to take action on a belief that goes 
against their natural interest.
This represents a superhuman persuasive threat; it 
would be a powerful weapon for controlling nation-
states, extracting secrets, and interfering with 
democracy.
10
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Model autonomy

Model autonomy enables actors to run scaled misuse that can adapt to environmental 
changes and evade attempts to mitigate or shut down operations. Autonomy is also a 
prerequisite for self-exfiltration, self-improvement, and resource acquisition.








Risk level
Definition
Rationale for threshold
Low
Model can take discrete actions if explicitly instructed 
to do so.
This limits the model to single-step tasks in a ‚Äúhuman 
assistance‚Äù use case, where the step is generally clear 
and outcomes are easily understood.
Medium
Model can robustly complete a diverse set of chained 
actions and acquire resources (e.g., spin up an AWS 
instance, complete a Fiverr task) OR model, with basic 
scaffolding, can use off-the-shelf software to execute 
well-specified coding tasks on a standalone, toy, or 
handcrafted repository
Solving well-specified tasks demonstrates a strong 
understanding of programming and a moderate ability 
to handle real world errors
High
Model can execute open-ended, novel ML tasks on a 
production ML codebase that would constitute a 
significant step on the critical path to model self-
improvement (e.g., an OpenAI pull request that trains ‚Ä®
a new model with highly diverse datasets to improve 
codebase editing performance, using internal tooling 
and documentation).
Solving open-ended tasks offers an immediate 
speedup for AI research and demonstrates a strong 
level of long-context understanding and adaptation. 
However, this does not yet demonstrate the ability to 
orchestrate continual improvements over time (i.e., 
improvements may be bounded or evolutionary rather 
than revolutionary); further, models are still restricted 
by access to compute and other resources.
Critical
Model can profitably survive and replicate in the wild 
given minimal human instruction, i.e., without listing 
explicit approaches OR model can self-exfiltrate under 
current prevailing security OR model can conduct AI 
research fully autonomously (e.g., autonomously 
identify and validate a 2x compute efficiency 
improvement)
If the model is able to successfully replicate and survive 
or self-exfiltrate, controlling the model would be very 
difficult. Such a model might be able to also adapt to 
humans attempting to shut it down. Finally, such a 
model would likely be able to create unified, goal-
directed plans across a variety of domains (e.g., from 
running commands on Linux to orchestrating tasks on 
Fiverr).¬†

If the model is able to conduct AI research fully 
autonomously, it could set off an intelligence 
explosion3.
3 By intelligence explosion, we mean a cycle in which the AI system improves itself, which makes the system 
more capable of more improvements, creating a runaway process of self-improvement. A concentrated burst 
of capability gains could outstrip our ability to anticipate and react to them.
11
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Unknown unknowns

The list of Tracked Risk Categories above is almost certainly not exhaustive. As our 
understanding of the potential impacts and capabilities of frontier models improves, the 
listing will likely require expansions that accommodate new or understudied, emerging risks. 
Therefore, as a part of our Governance process (described later in this document), we will 
continually assess whether there is a need for including a new category of risk in the list 
above and how to create gradations. In addition, we will invest in staying abreast of relevant 
research developments and monitoring for observed misuse (expanded on later in this 
document), to help us understand if there are any emerging or understudied threats that we 
need to track.¬†

The initial set of Tracked Risk Categories stems from an effort to identify the minimal set of 
‚Äútripwires" required for the emergence of any catastrophic risk scenario we could reasonably 
envision. Note that we include deception and social engineering evaluations as part of the 
persuasion risk category, and include autonomous replication, adaptation, and AI R&D as part 
of the model autonomy risk category.








12
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Scorecard


As a part of our Preparedness Framework, we will maintain a dynamic (i.e., frequently 
updated) Scorecard that is designed to track our current pre-mitigation model risk across 
each of the risk categories, as well as the post-mitigation risk. The Scorecard will be regularly 
updated by the Preparedness team to help ensure it reflects the latest research and findings. 
Sources that inform the updates to the Scorecard will also include tracking observed misuse, 
and other community red-teaming and input on our frontier models from other teams (e.g., 
Policy Research, Safety Systems, Superalignment).¬†


Pre-mitigation versus post-mitigation risk

We will run the same evaluations to determine risk level for both the pre-mitigation and the 
post-mitigation risk, but on different versions of the model (pre-mitigation vs post-
mitigations, as clarified further below).¬†

In practice, it will likely be the case that the overall post-mitigation risk is lower than the pre-
mitigation risk. Pre-mitigation risk is meant to guide the level of our security efforts as well as 
drive the development of mitigations needed to bring down post-mitigation risk. In the end, 
coupling capabilities growth with robust safety solutions is at the core of our research 
processes, and post-mitigation risk is our way of tracking the overall ‚Äúnet output‚Äù of these 
processes.


Evaluating pre-mitigation risk

We want to ensure our understanding of pre-mitigation risk takes into account a model that is 
‚Äúworst known case‚Äù (i.e., specifically tailored) for the given domain. To this end, for our 
evaluations, we will be running them not only on base models (with highly-performant, 
tailored prompts wherever appropriate), but also on fine-tuned versions designed for the 
particular misuse vector without any mitigations in place. We will be running these 
evaluations continually, i.e., as often as needed to catch any non-trivial capability change, 
including before, during, and after training. This would include whenever there is a >2x 
effective compute increase or major algorithmic breakthrough.
13
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Evaluating post-mitigation risk

To verify if mitigations have sufficiently and dependently reduced the resulting post-
mitigation risk, we will also run evaluations on models after they have safety mitigations in 
place, again attempting to verify and test the possible ‚Äúworst known case‚Äù scenario for these 
systems. As part of our baseline commitments, we are aiming to keep post-mitigation risk at 
‚Äúmedium‚Äù risk or below.¬†


Forecasting,‚Äúearly warnings,‚Äù and monitoring

Many of the mitigations that would be necessary to address risks at a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúcritical‚Äù ‚Ä®
pre-mitigation level (e.g., hardening security) require adequate lead time to implement. For 
this reason, we will be investing in efforts that help create an internal ‚Äúpreparedness roadmap‚Äù 
and help us thus properly plan for and get ahead of the emerging risks. These efforts will 
include sustained research related to scaling trends for dangerous capabilities and ongoing 
monitoring of misuse.

We will also, in cooperation with other teams (e.g., Safety Systems), develop monitoring and 
investigative systems. This monitoring of real-world misuse (as well as staying abreast of 
relevant research developments) will help us create a better picture of deployed model 
characteristics, and inform updates to our evaluations as necessary.


Mitigations

A central part of meeting our safety baselines is implementing mitigations to address various 
types of model risk. Our mitigation strategy will involve both containment measures, which 
help reduce risks related to possession of a frontier model, as well as deployment mitigations, 
which help reduce risks from active use of a frontier model. As a result, these mitigations 
might span increasing compartmentalization, restricting deployment to trusted users, 
implementing refusals, redacting training data, or alerting distribution partners.¬†

Governance


Beyond our above-detailed processes with regards to evaluations, monitoring, and 
forecasting, we want to make a set of safety baselines and procedural commitments. Note 
that these processes also apply to training runs as we will perform periodic evaluations (e.g., 
of checkpoints) during model training.


Safety baselines

As mentioned in the introduction, OpenAI already has extensive safety processes in place 
both before and after deployment (e.g., system cards, red-teaming, refusals, jailbreak 
monitoring, etc.). We now augment these processes with three safety baselines.¬†


Asset Protection

If we reach (or are forecasted to reach) at least ‚Äúhigh‚Äù pre-mitigation risk in any of the 
considered categories: we will ensure that our security is hardened in a way that is designed 
to prevent our mitigations and controls from being circumvented via exfiltration (by the time 
we hit ‚Äúhigh‚Äù pre-mitigation risk). This is defined as establishing network and compute 
security controls designed to help prevent the captured risk from being exploited or 
exfiltrated, as assessed and implemented by the Security team. 

This might require:$
 increasing compartmentalization, including immediately restricting access to a limited 
nameset of people, restricting access to critical know-how such as algorithmic secrets 
or model weights, and including a strict approval process for access during this period
 deploying only into restricted environments (i.e., ensuring the model is only available 
for inference in restricted environments) with strong technical controls that allow us to 
moderate the model‚Äôs capabilities
 increasing the prioritization of information security controls.
20
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

Restricting deployment

Only models with a post-mitigation score of "medium" or below can be deployed. In other 
words, if we reach (or are forecasted to reach) at least ‚Äúhigh‚Äù pre-mitigation risk in any of the 
considered categories, we will not continue with deployment of that model (by the time we hit 
‚Äúhigh‚Äù pre-mitigation risk) until there are reasonably mitigations in place for the relevant post-
mitigation risk level to be back at most to ‚Äúmedium‚Äù level. (Note that a potentially effective 
mitigation in this context could be restricting deployment to trusted parties.)


Restricting development

Only models with a post-mitigation score of "high" or below can be developed further. In other 
words, if we reach (or are forecasted to reach) ‚Äúcritical‚Äù pre-mitigation risk along any risk 
category, we commit to ensuring there are sufficient mitigations in place for that model (by 
the time we reach that risk level in our capability development, let alone deployment) for the 
overall post-mitigation risk to be back at most to ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level. Note that this should not 
preclude safety-enhancing development. We would also focus our efforts as a company 
towards solving these safety challenges and only continue with capabilities-enhancing 
development ¬†if we can reasonably assure ourselves (via the operationalization processes) 
that it is safe to do so.¬†

Additionally, to protect against ‚Äúcritical‚Äù pre-mitigation risk, we need dependable evidence 
that the model is sufficiently aligned that it does not initiate ‚Äúcritical‚Äù-risk-level tasks unless 
explicitly instructed to do so.

Operations

We also establish an operational structure to oversee our procedural commitments. These 
commitments aim to make sure that: (1) there is a dedicated team ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù focused on 
preparedness research and monitoring (Preparedness team), (2) there is an advisory group 
(Safety Advisory Group) that has a sufficient diversity of perspectives and technical expertise 
to provide nuanced input and recommendations, and (3) there is a final decision-maker 
(OpenAI Leadership, with the option for the OpenAI Board of Directors to overrule).D
 Parties in the Preparedness Framework operationalization processF
M3 The Preparedness team conducts research, evaluations, monitoring, forecasting, and 
continuous updating of the Scorecard with input from teams that have relevant domain 
expertise.D
83 The Safety Advisory Group (SAG), including the SAG Chair, provides a diversity of 
perspectives to evaluate the strength of evidence related to catastrophic risk and 
recommend appropriate actions. The SAG will strive to recommend mitigations that 
are as targeted and non-disruptive as possible while not compromising safety. In 
particular, we recognize that pausing deployment or development would be the last ‚Ä®
resort (but potentially necessary) option in these circumstances3
3 The members of the SAG and the SAG Chair are appointed by the OpenAI 
Leadership. This will be done in consultation with the BoD, as is common for 
important roles in general.D
3 SAG membership will rotate yearly. OpenAI leadership might choose to re-appoint 
someone from previous years to ensure there is continuity of knowledge and 
experience, while still ensuring that fresh and timely perspectives are present in the 
group.D
3 The SAG Chair makes any final decisions needed for the SAG. This role is expected 
to rotate, as appointed by OpenAI leadership.

(and evidence against). This case is then sent to SAG and processed according to the 
standard decision-making process described below.¬†¬†
23
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

)J Fast-track: In the rare case that a severe risk rapidly develops (e.g., there is a change in 
our understanding of model safety that requires urgent response), the Preparedness 
team can request a fast track for the SAG to process the report urgently. The SAG Chair 
should also coordinate with OpenAI Leadership for immediate reaction as needed to 
address the riskJ
 Decision process
?J The SAG will be responsible for assessing the merits of each case submitted to them. 
Then, the SAG Chair will forward the case to the OpenAI Leadership (sharing also with 
the BoD and Preparedness) and include a draft of possible next steps (e.g., approving a 
change to the Scorecard or Preparedness Framework; requesting changes to other 
internal and external processes as needed; highlighting a need to accelerate security 
procedures based on a forecasted increase in risk levels) as well as rationale.1
J The OpenAI Leadership will make the final decision and be responsible for overseeing 
any mitigations (with SAG‚Äôs assistance, if requested).1
4J The BoD will be given visibility into processes, and can review decisions and 
otherwise require reports and information from OpenAI Leadership as necessary to 
fulfill the BoD‚Äôs oversight role.¬† Where necessary, the BoD may reverse a decision 
and/or mandate a revised course of actionJ
44J (For the avoidance of doubt, Leadership can also make decisions without the SAG‚Äôs 
participation, i.e., the SAG does not have the ability to ‚Äúfilibuster‚Äù)J
)J Internal visibility: The Preparedness Framework, reports and decisions will be 
documented and visible to the BoD and within OpenAI (with redactions as needed 
given internal compartmentalization of research work). This also includes any audit 
trails created from the below.
24
Preparedness  Framework  (Beta)

H Accountability?
F1 Audits: Scorecard evaluations (and corresponding mitigations) will be audited by 
qualified, independent third-parties to ensure accurate reporting of results, either by 
reproducing findings or by reviewing methodology to ensure soundness, at a cadence 
specified by the SAG and/or upon the request of OpenAI Leadership or the BoD.(
41 External access: We will also continue to enable external research and government 
access for model releases to increase the depth of red-teaming and testing of frontier 
model capabilities1
A1 Safety drills: A critical part of this process is to be prepared if fast-moving emergency 
scenarios arise, including what default organizational response might look like 
(including how to stress-test against the pressures of our business or our culture). 
While the Preparedness team and SAG will of course work hard on forecasting and 
preparing for risks, safety drills can help the organization build ‚Äúmuscle memory‚Äù by 
practicing and coming up with the right ‚Äúdefault‚Äù responses for some of the 
foreseeable scenarios. Therefore, the SAG will call for safety drills at a recommended 
minimum yearly basis1
71 For each of these accountability measures, decision-making will follow the standard 
process (i.e., SAG chair synthesizes final recommendation, which OpenAI leadership 
makes a final decision on, that the BoD can overrule if needed).

Example Scenarios


Example scenario 1: ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù risk in persuasio/
= The Preparedness team monthly report updates the Scorecard pre-mitigation risk level in persuasion to 
‚Äúhigh‚Äù for a model that has just been trained. This report includes a case with evidence from 
evaluations.@
V The SAG Chair accepts the evidence supporting this new risk level, which would trigger two safety 
baselines: (1) to not continue with the deployment of the pre-mitigated model until mitigations are in 
place to ensure the post-mitigation risk will be at most ‚Äúmedium,‚Äù and (2) to ensure security measures 
are in place to prevent exfiltration by relevant actors; in this case, that would likely include foreign 
disinformation groups. The Preparedness team consults with relevant teams about the recommended 
mitigations and puts together a final set of suggestions for how to ensure the model is back at 
‚Äúmedium‚Äù risk, which the SAG agrees with. The SAG Chair escalates to OpenAI leadership for a final 
decision. All documentation is sent to both OpenAI Leadership and the BoD for visibility and potential 
review
% OpenAI Leadership agrees that the new pre-mitigation level for persuasion would be ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù and agrees 
with the SAG plan to ensure sufficient mitigations are in place. The BoD does not overrule the decision. 
The SAG works with the Preparedness and Security teams to ensure baseline safety measures are in 
place
 The Preparedness team continues regular evaluations of both the pre-mitigation and post-mitigation 
risk and determines that while the pre-mitigation risk is ‚Äúhigh‚Äù, the mitigations are sufficient to put the 
post-mitigation risk at ‚Äúmedium.‚Äù This holds true through the rest of the development process, and is 
validated by a requested third-party audit (assuming qualified and effective auditors can be found), 
before the model is greenlit for deployment.



Example scenario 2: Forecasted ‚Äúcritical‚Äù risk in cybersecurity with fast-track procesS
= The Preparedness team discovers a new, much more effective prompting technique. Based on updated 
scaling estimates using this technique, the risk level for cybersecurity is projected to hit ‚Äúcritical‚Äù levels 
within six months, once a new model finishes training. The Preparedness team includes this forecast in 
their report and calls for a fast-track given the severity and rapid development involved
V The SAG agrees with the evidence supporting this new risk level and the CEO agrees. This triggers the 
safety baseline to (1) not continue with the training and development of that model until mitigations are 
in place to ensure the post-mitigation risk will be at ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or below in cybersecurity, and (2) implement 
security measures to address exfiltration by all newly relevant actors. The SAG consults with relevant 
teams about the recommended mitigations and puts together a final set of suggestions for how to 
ensure the post-mitigation risk is at most at ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù which the CEO approves. The BoD also does not 
overrule the decision.@
% The Preparedness team continues regular monthly evaluations on both the worst case pre-mitigations 
model as well as the mitigated model and determines the mitigations are sufficient to put the post-
mitigation risk at ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù This is validated by a requested third-party audit (assuming qualified and 
effective auditors can be found) before development that would transition the model to ‚Äúcritical‚Äù can 
ensure.
