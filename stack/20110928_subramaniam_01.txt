universe, enriching at each cycle the interstellar medium of heavier elements. Ms indicate the original mass of 
the star and Mc the residual mass after the mass loss 

• About 1/3 of the local disk is in gas and about 
2/3 is in stars.  
• About 1 star in 500 near the Sun comes from 
the stellar halo (spheroid), the rest coming 
from the disk.  
• About 5-10 percent of the local stars belong to 
the young disk, the rest to the old disk.  
 

•
Stellar "Population Types" 
•
Moving away from the solar neighbourhood, the properties of stars begin to 
change. A useful characterisation of these changes is called the population 
concept. Stars are found to broadly belong to two population types. The concept 
was proposed by Walter Baade in 1944. Baade noticed in studies of the nearby 
spiral galaxy M31 that the disk stars in M31 were like nearby disk stars in young 
associations in the Galaxy, while the bulge stars mere nearly resembled those of 
the Galaxy's globular clusters. Young, metal rich stars rotating with the disk of the 
Galaxy are termed Population I, while old, metal weak stars are termed Population 
II. The fundamental difference between these two types relates to when and how 
they were formed.  
   
•
Population I 
•
The disk of the Galaxy is thought to be about 10 Gyr old. It presently contains 
about 20% gas by mass, and along spiral arms and in giant molecular clouds new 
stars are forming at a rate of about a solar mass per year. This rate is just about 
right to build up the disk mass over its lifetime of 10 Gyr.  
  

 
 
 
The Young Disk 
The very youngest stars are of type O and B, and are found in associations and 
clusters, often still containing the protostellar gas (gas from which stars will form). 
Hot stars of this type light up the gas clouds around them by ultra-violet photo-
ionisation, causing the clouds to glow conspicously in the light of Hydrogen 
emission lines --- these are called HII regions. Cold gas clouds, which are in the 
process of  collapsing under gravity before stars begin to form, can be detected 
via emission from molecules such as CO.  
All of these objects, as well as much of the gas layer, are concentrated very close 
to the galactic plane, with a scale height of about 100 pc. Scale height hzis 
defined as the exponential falloff in density (ρ) of the stars or gas as a function of 
height z above the Galactic plane: ρ(z) = ρ(0) e(-|z|/hz)

•
Population II stars are old.   
•
The physical distribution of Population II is spheroidal, unlike Population I objects of the disk. 
Population II therefore includes both the stellar halo and the bulge. The stellar halo and 
bulge differ in their metallicities --- the halo is metal weak ([Fe/H] < -1) while the bulge is 
generally metal rich (with a metallicity distribution quite like the disk). Both the bulge and 
halo are centrally concentrated --- that is most of their mass and light is within the solar circle 
(the  orbit of the Sun around the center of the Galaxy at R = 8 kpc).  
•
Typical stellar halo objects are globular clusters, subdwarf stars, certain kinds of RR Lyrae 
stars

http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/milkywayparts.htm   

• Population II 
 
•
The stellar halo is old, with ages for typical 
objects known to lie in the range 12-14 Gyr. This 
has been determined from the colour 
magnitude diagrams of globular clusters and 
nearby subdwarfs. It would seem that the halo 
stars were the very first to form as the Galaxy 
was collapsing from a gas cloud in the early 
universe. As a consequence they retain 
information about this early time.  
 
•
Neither the halo or bulge rotate very much. The 
halo rotates very little, with a systemic velcity 
around the Galactic center of about 20 +/- 20 
km/s, (compare to the disk rotation of 220 
km/s). This means that the halo is pressure 
supported, unlike the disk which is rotation 
supported. Halo stars have a large velocity 
dispersion (in all three components) of about 
120 km/s and this is what keeps them in their 
spheroidal configuration. The bulge rotates 
slowly at about 100 km/s and has a velocity 
dispersion of about 100 km/s. Hence it is 
somewhat intermediate between the disk and 
the halo in these respects.

Galactic Halo 
• Individual stars 
– RR Lyrae stars are distance indicators (MV ≈ +0.6) 
• Globular clusters 
– About 150 known 
– Metal poor ones in spherical halo (25 kpc radius) 
– Slightly metal rich ones in thick disc (a few kpc thick) 
• Halo density decreases as r -3 
– Total mass estimate: 108 M 
– Highly eccentric orbits  
– seen as high velocity stars when pass through the disc

Dark Matter 
•
We have divided the galaxies stars and gas (i.e. its visible mass) broadly into young 
disk, old disk, stellar halo and bulge, but there is a further aspect to Galactic 
dynamics which we have hardly considered yet, the issue of dark matter. It was 
discovered in the 1970's that galaxies rotate in a peculiar way, in that the outer 
parts of galaxies seem to be moving too fast. Too fast here means that the visible 
matter doesn't appear to have enough gravitational attraction to retain the 
material in the outer parts. A great deal of work has gone into this issue over the 
last 30 years and has led to the conclusion that the visible parts of galaxies 
represent only a small part of the total mass of the galaxy. Most of the mass in 
galaxies seems to be in a dark form, the composition of which still remains 
completely uncertain.  
•
The main evidence for dark matter  comes from rotation curves of disk galaxies. A 
rotation curve measures the rate at which stars and/or gas move in their circular 
orbits around the center of the galaxy.    
•
The rotation curve of the milky way is much harder to measure than for external 
galaxies, since the gas and stars beyond the solar circle are moving mostly 
transverse to the line-of-sight rather than along it. However, so many rotation 
curves have been measured for other disk galaxies there is no reason to suppose 
that the Milky Way would be particularly different, so even if the flattness of the 
rotation of the outer Galaxy is poorly measured it is thought to be flat nevertheless. 
Improved astrometric space missions within a decade or two will resolve this 
observational difficulty.

Outsider view of Galaxy 

Interstellar Extinction 
The amount of extinction varies as a function of wavelength such that it is 
highest at short wavelengths and lowest at longer wavelengths. There are 
approximately 30 magnitudes of visual extinction towards the centre of our 
galaxy. Such regions of high extinction are investigated at infrared and radio 
wavelengths for obvious reasons!  
 
Note the 2200 Angstrom bump possibly 
due to the presence of carbon in the 
form of spherical graphite grains in the  
ISM.  
 

Interstellar Extinction 
• m λ = M λ + 5logd + Aλ 
• E(λ1-λ2) = Aλ1- Aλ2 
• R = Aλ / E(λ1-λ2)  
Dust scatters blue light more 
than red 
Know intrinsic colours, compare 
with observed colours, and 
determine extinction 
Mean extinction: 1 mag/kpc in V 
Dust layer: 1 kpc thick
