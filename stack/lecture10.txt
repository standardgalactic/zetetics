Growth function
Consider the case Y = {±1} (classiﬁcation). Let φ be the 0-1 loss function and F be a class of ±1-valued functions.
We can relate the Rademacher average of φF to that of F as follows.
Lemma 1.1. Suppose F ⊆{±1}X and let φ(y′, y) = 1 [y′ ̸= y] be the 0-1 loss function. Then we have,
Rm(φF) = 1
2Rm(F) .
Proof. Note that we can write φ(y′, y) as (1 −yy′)/2. Then we have,
Rm(φF) = E

Equation (1) follows because E [ϵi|Xm
1 , Y m
1 ] = 0. Equation (2) follows because −ϵiYi’s jointly have the same distri-
bution as ϵi’s.
Note that the Rademacher average of the class F can also be written as

where F|Xm
1 is the function class F restricted to the set X1, . . . , Xm. That is,
F|Xm
1 := {((f(X1), . . . , f(Xm)) | f ∈F} .
Note that F|Xm
1 is ﬁnite and
|F|Xm
1 | ≤min{|F|, 2m} .
Thus we can deﬁne the growth function as
ΠF(m) :=

The following lemma due to Massart allows us to bound the Rademacher average in terms of the growth function.

Finite Class Lemma (Massart). Let A be some ﬁnite subset of Rm and ϵ1, . . . , ϵm be independent Rademacher
random variables. Let r = supa∈A ∥a∥. Then, we have,

Taking logs and dividing by λ, we get that, for any λ > 0,
µ ≤ln |A|

Setting λ =

which proves the lemma.
