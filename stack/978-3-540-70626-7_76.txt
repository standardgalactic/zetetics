Gauge Symmetry
Holger Lyre
Gauge symmetries characterize a class of physical theories, so-called gauge theories
or gauge ﬁeld theories, based on the requirement of the invariance under a group of
transformations, so-called gauge transformations, which occur in a theory’s frame-
work if the theory comprises more variables than there are physically independent
degrees of freedom. Gauge  symmetry was ﬁrstly acknowledged in Maxwell’s
electrodynamics, where the vector potential shows a freedom of transformation in
the sense that it is not uniquely determined by the Maxwell ﬁeld equations, but
only up to adding the derivative of a scalar function. Since all three fundamental
quantum ﬁeld theoretic interactions as well as gravity can be reconstructed within a
gauge theoretic framework, gauge ﬁeld theories represent the backbone of modern
physics today, that is, the physics of the Standard Model and beyond.  Quantum
ﬁeld theory; particle physics.
Short History and Core Idea
In modern notation based on four-tensor-valued ﬁelds, classical Maxwellian electro-
dynamics is captured by the Lagrangian LE = −1
4FμνF μν −jμAμ with a tensor
Fμν = ∂μAν −∂νAμ comprising the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths and the
vector potential Aμ. The Maxwell ﬁeld equations follow from the variation of LE
according to Aμ as a dynamic ﬁeld variable as ∂μF μν = jν and ϵμνλσ∂νFλσ = 0
(Bianchi identity of F μν). While it seems natural to consider Aμ as a basic variable,
the true observable quantity of the theory, the ﬁeld F μν, remains unchanged under
gauge transformations of the potential
Aμ(x) →A′
μ(x) = Aμ(x) −∂μα(x).
(1)
Here α may be any differentiable scalar function, either constant or dependent on
the spacetime variable x. This amounts to saying that Maxwellian electrodynamics
shows a gauge freedom under both global and local gauge transformations.
The gauge freedom of classical electrodynamics went largely unrecognized. In
1918, however, Hermann Weyl conjectured a uniﬁed theory of gravitation and elec-
trodynamics by extending Einstein’s idea of his thus completed general theory of
relativity. Here the Riemannian geometry of spacetime itself becomes dynamical.
However, while in Riemannian geometry the comparison of directions at two points

depends on the paths connecting these points, the comparison of lengths does not.
Weyl argued that, in a true inﬁnitesimal geometry, the scale of length should also
undergo a change, such that, under parallel transport, a “gauge measure of length”
(in German: “Eichmaßstab”) should undergo a change dℓ= Aμ(x)dxμ ℓ, where the
function Aμ should be identiﬁed with the Maxwell potential. This latter suggestion
is established by the formalism within which the above formulae of Maxwellian
electrodynamics can be derived including the gauge transformations (1) of the po-
tential, thus leading to a “geometrization” of electromagnetics. Einstein applauded
to the admirable depth and boldness of Weyl’s mathematical invention, but at the
same time recognized the physical failure of the theory, since in Weylian space-
time the length of a rod and speed of a clock would depend on the history, in contrast
to the observed uniquely deﬁned frequencies of the spectral lines of chemical ele-
ments (the second clock effect in Weylian spacetime can also be considered as a
classical analogue of the  Aharonov-Bohm effect).
In 1929, however, and based on earlier work of Fock and London, Weyl found
the correct way to establish the idea of “gauging.” He realized that one must gauge
the internal phase factor of the quantum  wave function in order to get a recipe
to combine a free matter ﬁeld theory with the theory of electromagnetic interaction.
This recipe is nowadays widely known as the “gauge principle” (see next section). In
fact, his 1929 paper “Electron and gravitation” must in retrospect be considered one
of the cornerstone papers of twentieth century physics, because in it Weyl not only
invented the gauge principle, but also developed the ﬁrst systematic formulation of
the spinor and tetrad formalism (cf. [36–40] for the history of gauge theories).
Gauge Principle and Yang–Mills Theories
The Lagrangian of the free Dirac matter ﬁeld LD = ¯ψ(iγ μ∂μ −m)ψ admits global
gauge symmetry transformations ψ′ = eiqαψ which form the unitary group U(1).
From Noether’s ﬁrst theorem, jμ = q ¯ψγ μψ follows as the conserved charge den-
sity current. To construct a U(1) gauge theory the invariance of LD under local
phase transformations
ψ′(x) = eiqα(x)ψ(x),
(2)
also known as gauge transformations of the ﬁrst kind, is postulated. This postulate
can be fulﬁlled under the replacement of the usual derivative in LD by the covariant
derivative
∂μ →Dμ = ∂μ + iqAμ(x)
(3)
with a vector ﬁeld Aμ which itself obeys the local gauge transformations (1) of
the second kind. It seems obvious to identify Aμ with the electromagnetic gauge
potential and to end up with the total Lagrangian
LDM = ¯ψ(iγ μ∂μ −m)ψ −jμAμ −1

of the combined Dirac-Maxwell matter and interaction ﬁeld theory obeying full
local gauge invariance. This is the idea of the gauge principle, its simplest ﬁeld-
theoretic application leads to an abelian U(1) gauge theory, on which quantum
electrodynamics is based.
In 1954, Yang and Mills extended the idea to non-abelian gauge groups SU(n). In
the Standard Model the theory of electroweak interaction is considered an SUI(2)×
UY (1) of ﬂavor and hypercharge and the theory of strong interaction an SUC(3)
gauge theory of nucleonic color charge. The most important difference to the abelian
case is the appearance of an additional term in the potentials Ba

Fibre Bundles and Constrained Systems
The appropriate mathematical description of gauge theories is given within the
enlarged geometrical arena of principal ﬁbre bundles and their associated vector
bundles [2, 31, 32, 34]. A ﬁbre bundle is a structure ⟨E, M, π, F, G⟩with bundle
space E, base manifold M, projection map π : E →M, ﬁbre space F and struc-
ture group G. Fibre bundles can be considered as generalizations of the Cartesian
product in the sense that they look locally like M × F (all ﬁbres Fp = π−1(p) at
p ∈M being homeomorphic to the typical ﬁbre F). A local trivialisation is given
by a  diffeomorphism φi : Ui × F →π−1(Ui) for some open set Ui ⊂M. In
order to obtain the global bundle structure the local chart domains Ui must be glued
together with transition functions tij (p) = φ−1 ◦φj
 (p). If the ﬁbre is given by
an n dimensional linear vector space Vn the bundle is called a vector bundle. For a
principal bundle P(M, G) the ﬁbre F is identical to the structure group G. To any
principal bundle there exists a totality of associated vector bundles with the same
structure group and transition functions.
In the Lagrangian view of gauge theories one usually considers ﬁbre bundles
over spacetime M as base space with a continuous Lie group, the gauge group G,
as structure group. The connection of the principal bundle P(M, G) is physically
interpreted as the gauge potential, which takes values in the Lie algebra g of G. The
generators represent the gauge bosons. The derivative of the connection, the bundle
curvature, encodes the interaction ﬁeld strength. The connection can be thought
of as a rule which decomposes the tangent of P into a horizontal and a vertical
part TuP = VuP ⊕HuP for every u ∈P, it is deﬁned as a g-valued one-form
projecting TuP to VuP ∼= g. This idea is also expressed by the covariant derivative
(2). Matter ﬁelds are deﬁned as (local) sections in some associated bundle E of P,

usually a vector bundle. A ﬁbre bundle section is deﬁned as a mapping σ : M →E
and can be thought of as a generalization of a tangent vector ﬁeld. With π (σ(p)) =
p the section σ(p) ∈Fp is local. A principal bundle is trivial, if it admits a global
section.
Phenomenological high energy physics mostly uses the Lagrangian formulation
of gauge theories, but for certain purposes, in particular for the formulation of
canonical general relativity, the Hamiltonian approach seems better suited (cf. [33]).
Earman [7,8] has argued at length for the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian view
also for the purposes of philosophy of physics because of its mathematical rigor.
The transition from the Lagrangian velocity phase space V(q, ˙q) to the Hamilto-
nian phase space (q, p) is mediated by a Legendre transformation. If Noether’s
second theorem applies, the canonical momenta p = ∂L
∂˙q are not independent and
primary constraints ϕ(q, p) = 0 exist. These constraints generate gauge transfor-
mations (elements of G) which form gauge orbits [p] (equivalence classes of p
under G), such that one ends up with a reduced phase space ˜ = /G. For in-
stance, in Maxwellian electrodynamics in vacuo the canonical variable ⃗E is subject
to the constraint div E = 0.
The Interpretation of Gauge Symmetry
A ﬁrst point of interest is whether local gauge transformations are observable. Text-
books sometimes give the false impression that this could indeed be the case, since
it is for instance possible to change the interference pattern in a  double-slit ex-
periment by inserting a phase shifter. Such a device, however, does not instantiate a
local phase transformation, but rather a relative phase change between the two parts
corresponding to the two slits of the total wave function ψ = ψI + ψII. In partic-
ular, as Brading and Brown [4] have pointed out, the phase of ψI at some point on
the interference screen will be changed under a local gauge transformation by the
same amount as the phase of ψII at that same point.
Philosophy of physics has especially focussed on the logic of the gauge prin-
ciple. There is a certain consensus (cf. [5, 11, 17, 20, 25] that in a wide variety of
the textbook literature the gauge principle is overstated, since it is sometimes said
to “dictate” the interaction from the mere requirement of local gauge invariance.
However, let |x⟩be the position representation of a wave function (x) = ⟨x|φ⟩,
where {|φ⟩} span an abstract  Hilbert space, then local gauge transformations
|x′⟩= eiχ(x)|x⟩= ˆU|x⟩must properly be seen as mere changes in |x⟩. Such a
change of representation affects the  operators as well, which generally transform
as ˆO′ = ˆU ˆO ˆU+. In the particular case of the derivative or momentum operator one
gets the covariant derivative as a result, which is thus uncovered as a mere change
in the position representation. In ﬁbre bundle terminology, this amounts to saying
that the inhomogeneous term in the covariant derivative (2) includes a ﬂat connec-
tion only, where the corresponding curvature or gauge ﬁeld strength is still zero.
Hence, no non-vanishing gauge ﬁeld is enforced by the requirement of local gauge
symmetry.

252
Gauge Symmetry
Gauge symmetry structure is, as Redhead [24] has dubbed it, mere surplus struc-
ture. Only the gauge-invariant quantities ﬁgure as candidates for observable entities.
 Quantum Electrodynamics, for instance, is quite aptly characterized as a U(1)
gauge theory, insofar as the U(1)-invariant tensor F μν can found to be realized in
nature as the electrodynamic ﬁeld strength. Unfortunately, up to now there seems
to exist no straightforward procedure to identify the symmetries which are gauge as
opposed to other, empirically signiﬁcant symmetries in a given theoretical frame-
work.
Because of the gauge freedom of constrained Hamiltonian systems there exists no
unique system evolution in phase space, but rather an indeterministic time-evolution
where a unique phase space point pt must be replaced by a gauge orbit [pt].
Earman [7,8] has pointed out that this breakdown of determinism is a general feature
of the gauge freedom of constraint Hamiltonian systems (in analogy to the notori-
ous “hole argument” based on the Leibniz equivalence of diffeomorphic models of
spacetime theories). The real conceptual problem here is to develop general rules for
deciding whether certain transformations in the mathematical apparatus of physical
theories are gauge transformations or not.
Another philosophical debate concerns the question about the genuine entities
in gauge theories. Here the variety of answers spans a whole spectrum. The gen-
uine candidate for the basic entity in ﬁeld theories is the ﬁeld strength as a more or
less directly measurable quantity. In view of the typical gauge-theoretic non-local
effects such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, many authors favor the gauge potential
as the basic entity ( Aharonov-Bohm effect), which is, however, gauge-dependent
and not directly observable. A third option concerns holonomies or Wilson-loops as
non-separable but gauge-invariant entities ([3], particularly Healey [11–13]). Fur-
ther proposals consider the whole ﬁbre bundle structure [23] or the retarded Greens
function representation of the charge distribution [21] up to the view that we are
dealing with a genuine case of ontological indeterminacy and that we should di-
rect our ontological commitment only at the group theoretic, structural content of
gauge theories in the sense of structural realism [18]. Obviously, the debate about
the ontology of gauge theories has not been settled.
Gauge Theories of Gravity
General relativity can in fact be considered a gauge theory proper, not in the
above sense of a quantum but a classical gauge ﬁeld theory. An informal ap-
plication of the gauge principle starts from spinless matter following trajectories
described by the geodesic equation
d
dτ vμ(τ) = 0 with four-velocity vμ in ﬂat
Minkowski spacetime. The formal transition from special to general relativity ba-
sically amounts to replacing partial by covariant derivatives. Geodesic trajectories
on curved spacetime are thus described by d
dτ vμ(τ) + {}μ
νρ vν(τ) vρ(τ) = 0, where
the Christoffel symbols of the connection are derived from the metric according
to {}λ

and the Ricci scalar R = Rμ
μ all transform homogeneously. They can be used in
the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian LGR ∼√−g R, where g is the determinant of the
metric, leading to the Einstein equations.
Here again the mere appearance of Christoffel symbols in the geodesic equation
cannot enforce spacetime to be curved, but rather ensures a covariant, i.e. coordi-
nate independent, representation. Historically, the ﬁrst attempt to gauge gravity goes
back to Utiyama [26], who considered a gauge theory of the (homogeneous)Lorentz
group. It is a remarkable feature of gravitational gauge theories that the choice of
the kinetic term for the gauge ﬁelds and the corresponding gauge group is far less
restricted than in the Yang-Mills case. Cho [6] has developed ﬁrst a pure transla-
tional gauge ﬁeld theory with a particular choice of a quadratic Lagrangian. In such
a gauge theory of the four-dimensional translation group R1,3 one does not end up
with a curved Riemann space but rather a ﬂat teleparallel Weitzenb¨ock space, where
the gravitational ﬁeld strength is represented by the torsion instead of the curvature
tensor. There is an ongoing debate whether both approaches can in fact shown to
be empirically equivalent [10,22], rendering the ontology of gravity – curvature or
torsion – indetermined [16, 19]. In search of a more fundamental physics various
accounts of extended gauge groups such as for instance afﬁne or super groups have
been considered (cf. [15] and [14] for overviews).
The issue of gauging gravity is also intimately connected to the longstanding
debate about the status of the requirement of general covariance and the distinction
between  covariance and  symmetry groups, whether gauge or not. While any
sensible physical theory should allow for a generally covariant formulation, in gen-
eral relativity the diffeomorphism group seems to play a double role as covariance
and gauge group. A recent discussion, following Anderson’s [1] classic distinction
between dynamic and absolute objects, has been given by Guilini [9].

Generalizations of Quantum Statistics
O.W. Greenberg
The general principles of quantum theory allow statistics more general than bosons
or fermions. ( Bose-Einstein statistics and  Fermi statistics are discussed in sep-
arate articles.) The restriction to Bosons or Fermions requires the symmetrization
postulate, “the states of a system containing N identical particles are necessarily
either all symmetric or all antisymmetric under permutations of the N particles,” or,
equivalently, “all states of identical particles are in one-dimensional representations
of the symmetric group [1].” Messiah and Greenberg discussed quantum mechanics
without the symmetrization postulate [2]. The spin-statistics connection, that inte-
ger  spin particles are bosons and odd-half-integer spin particles are fermions [3],
is an independent statement. Identical particles in 2 space dimensions are a special
case, “ anyons.” Braid group statistics, a nonabelian analog of anyons, are also
special to 2 space dimensions.
All  observables must be symmetric in the dynamical variables associated with
identical particles. Observables can not change the permutation symmetry type of
the wave function; i.e. there is a superselection rule separating states in inequivalent
representations of the symmetric group and when identical particles can occur in
states that violate the  spin statistics theorem their transitions must occur in the
same representation of the symmetric group. One can not introduce a small violation
of statistics by assuming the Hamiltonian is the sum of a statistics-conserving and a
small statistics-violating term, H = HS+ϵHV , as one can for violations of  parity,
charge conjugation, etc. Violation of statistics must be introduced in a more subtle
way.
Doplicher et al. [4, 5] classiﬁed identical particle statistics in 3 or more space
dimensions. They found parabose and parafermi statistics of positive integer orders,
