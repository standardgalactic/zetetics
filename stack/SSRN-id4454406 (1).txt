ABSTRACT 
 
The dream of capturing the workings of the entire universe in a single equation or a simple set of 
equations is still pursued. A set of five new equivalent formulations of entropy based on the 
introduction of the mass of the information bit in Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics and on 
the physicality of information, is proposed, within the framework of the emergent entangled 
informational universe model, which is based on the principle of strong emergence, the mass-
energy-information equivalence principle and the Landauer’s principle. This model can explain 
various process as informational quantum processes such energy, dark matter, dark energy, 
cosmological constant and vacuum energy. The dark energy is explained as a collective potential of 
all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from 
the usual fields of matter of quantum field theory, associated with dark matter as having a finite and 
quantifiable mass; while resolving the black hole information paradox by calculating the entropy of 
the entangled Hawking radiation, and shedding light on gravitational fine-grained entropy of black 
holes. This model explains the collapse of the wave function by the fact that a measure informs the 
measurer about the system to be measured and, this model is able to invalidate the many worlds 
interpretation of quantum mechanics and the simulation hypothesis.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The dream pursued by Albert Einstein and many 
physicists who still pursued the dream of 
capturing the workings of the entire universe in a 
single equation or a simple set of equations is 
still pursued. A set of five new equivalent 
formulation expressing the notion of entropy able 
to reconcile quantum formalism and relativistic 
formalism can explain various processes as 
informational quantum processes, i.e., energy, 
black 
holes, 
dark 
matter, 
dark 
energy, 
cosmological constant and vacuum energy. 
Those equations are based on key concepts 
such as Landauer's principle [1], Louis de 
Broglie's hidden thermodynamics [2], mass-
energy-information equivalence principle [3], 
principle testable by an experimental protocol as 
given in [4], leading to the fundamentality of 
quantum information considered as physical with 
a finite and quantifiable mass. 
 
In the first part of this work entitled "Structural 
basis", some theoretical considerations are 
examined such as the definition of quantum 
information, 
quantum 
entanglement, 
some 
considerations on quantum non-locality as well 
as the notion of fundamentality of temperature 
and 
information, 
considered 
as 
the 
two 
fundamental building blocks of the universe. This 
section examines in detail the processes of 
emergence that give birth to degrees of freedom 
from which emerge the temperature and the 
information, both giving birth to the notion of 
energy according to Landauer's principle [1]. 
 
Moreover, this section offers an explicative 
informational process about the physical process 
of the collapse of the wave function based on the 
definition of the quantum measurement where a 
measure informs the measurer about the system 
to be measured, the measurer shares one or 
more degrees of freedom (information) with the 
system under considerations, and both are 
entangled together by the sharing of degrees of 
freedom [5].  
 
In the second part of this work, concerning the 
"Generalization" of the approach of entropic 
information theory, the mass of the bit of 
information of Melvin Vopson's mass-energy-
information 
equivalence 
principle 
[3], 
is 
introduced into Louis de Broglie's equations of 
hidden thermodynamics [2] leading to different 
equations of entropy formulation such as the 
relations 
of 
Boltzmann, 
Einstein, 
Planck, 
Avogadro and the fine structure formulation, as 
various new expressions of the notion of entropy 
[6].  
 
Also, in the second part of this work, is explained 
how, after injecting the temperature of Hawking 
radiation [7] into one of the new equations of 
entropy, this new formula can calculate the 
entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation up to 
the quantum system [5]. This new formulation of 
black hole entropy related to the work of Casini 
[8] and Bousso on Bekenstein bound [9-17], can 
calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy; as 
the black hole entropy saturates exactly the 
Bekenstein bound so it is equal to the Bekenstein 
bound which is itself according to Casini’s work 
equal to the von Neumann entropy itself equal to 
that of the Hawking radiation, which with the 
degrees of freedom of black holes produces a 
pure state, while the Hawking radiation being 
entangled with the fields inside black holes, 
allowing us to extract information that resides 
from the semiclassical viewpoint, in the black 
hole interior; at the end of evaporation, the full 
von Neumann entropy is again 0 , so no 
information is lost!. The black hole entropy 
horizon law turns out to be a special case of the 
Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture [18,19] which is a 
conjecture viewed as a general formula for the 
fine-grained 
entropy 
of 
quantum 
systems 
coupled to gravity. 
 
In the third part of this work on the “Dark Side”, 
entropic information theory is able to explain dark 
matter as the mass of the number of bits in the 
observable universe and is able to explain dark 
energy by the energy associated with this 
number of bits of information by the application of 
Landauer’s principle [20]. The energetic content 
of the emergent entangled informational universe 
appears in two forms: an empty component  
(dark energy) and a matter component (dark 
matter). 
 
The zero-point energy of the vacuum considered 
as dark energy is explained as a collective 
potential of all particles with their individual                  
zero-point 
energy 
emerging 
from 
an 
informational field, distinct from the usual fields of 
matter of quantum field theory, associated with 
dark matter as having a finite and quantifiable 
mass.

The approach of entropic information theory 
bridges the precipice of the cosmological 
constant problem by considering the mass of the 
information bit instead of the Planck mass in the 
calculation 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant, 
reducing the discrepancy of 120 orders of 
magnitude in the prediction of vacuum energy 
from a quantum perspective. 
 
2. METHODS 
 
Part One: Entropic information theory: Structural 
Bases 
 
2.1 Information  
 
2.1.1 Landauer’s principle 
 
Regarding information, Landauer's principle [1] is 
introduced, as a simple logical consequence of 
the second law of thermodynamics, the second 
law which states that the entropy of an isolated 
system increases or always remains the same; 
indeed, the change in entropy (delta S) is equal 
to the heat transfer (delta Q) divided by the 
temperature (T). For a given physical process, 
the entropy of the system and environment will 
remain a constant if the process can be 
reversed. Landauer's principle applies to all 
systems 
of 
nature, 
so 
any 
system, 
of 
temperature T, in which information is "erased" 
by a physical process will produce thermal 
energy per bit "erased" with a corresponding 
increase in information from the environment 
surrounding that system [21]. “Landauer showed 
that information is physical since the erasure of a 
bit of information in a temperature system, T, 
results in the release of a minimum, k T ln(2) of 
energy in the system environment” [22,23]. “This 
limit is the minimum amount of energy possible 
needed to erase a bit of information, known as 
the Landauer’s limit. Landauer’s principle is fully 
compatible with the laws of thermodynamics” 
[22,24,25,26]. “Landauer's principle can be 
derived from microscopic considerations [27] as 
well as well-established properties of Shannon–
Gibbs–Boltzmann entropy” [22]. “Landauer's 
principle applies to both classical and quantum 
information. Landauer's principle has now been 
verified experimentally for classical bits and 
quantum qubits” [27,28]. “This important physical 
prediction that links information theory and 
thermodynamics was verified experimentally for 
the first time in 2012” [29]. The principle therefore 
appears fundamental and universal in its 
application. 
About 
these 
perspectives, 
the 
information is therefore directly related to the 
fundamental physics of nature.  
 
2.1.2 Quantum information 
 
Quantum information is considered as the basic 
entity of study in quantum information theory and 
can be manipulated using quantum information 
processing techniques; quantum information is 
information about the state of a quantum system, 
information is something physical that is encoded 
in the state of a quantum system [30]. Indeed, 
Gleason's theorem says that a quantum state is 
completely determined by knowing only the 
answers to all possible yes/no questions, a 
yes/no question is presumably a self-adjoint 
operator with two distinct eigenvalues. 
 
2.1.3 Yes/No questions 
 
At the bottom level of what we call the Reality is 
the "it from bit" perspective route. "It from bit" 
perspective symbolizes the idea that every item 
of the physical world has at bottom — at a very 
deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial 
source and explanation; that what we call reality 
arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-
no questions and the registering of equipment-
evoked responses; in short, that all things 
physical are information-theoretic in origin and 
this is a participatory universe” [31]. But "It’s one 
thing 
to 
say 
that 
measurement 
requires 
information. It’s another thing to say that the 
thing being measured is created by the observer 
doing the measuring" [32]. The notion of 
information can be defined in a precise and 
relevant way; indeed, it can be said that following 
the 
entropic 
information 
theory 
approach 
“Information is a quantum state change due to 
the modification of a degree of freedom in the 
quantum system considered [20].”  
 
2.1.4 Entanglement 
 
As seen in [20], quantum information can be 
measured 
using 
Von 
Neumann’s 
entropy. 
Entropy 
is 
considered 
a 
measure 
of 
entanglement. Entropy provides a tool that can 
be used to quantify entanglement. Von Neumann 
entropy is a measure of the statistical uncertainty 
represented by a quantum state. In quantum 
physics, certain states, called entangled states, 
show certain statistical correlations between 
measurements on particles that cannot be 
explained by classical theory. An entangled 
system is defined as a system whose quantum 
state cannot be factored as a product of the

57 
 
states of its local constituents. That is, they are 
not individual particles but an inseparable whole. 
In quantum entanglement, one constituent 
cannot be described in detail without considering 
the other or others. The entanglement process is 
carried out when two particles are linked 
together, regardless of the separation from one 
to the other. In quantum mechanics, even if 
these entangled particles are not physically 
connected; they are always able to instantly 
share information. Following entropic information 
theory, quantum entanglement can be defined as 
the physical phenomenon that occurs when a 
group of particles is generated, interacts or 
shares spatial proximity such that one or more 
degrees of freedom are shared at the quantum 
level between each particle in the group; a 
particle cannot be described independently of the 
quantum state of others because they share 
degrees of freedom, even when the particles are 
separated by a great distance.  
 
2.1.5 Quantum nonlocality 
 
Quantum nonlocality is sometimes understood as 
being equivalent to entanglement. However, this 
is not the case. Quantum entanglement can be 
defined only within the formalism of quantum 
mechanics, i.e., it is a model-dependent property. 
In contrast, nonlocality refers to the impossibility 
of a description of observed statistics in terms of 
a local 
hidden 
variable model, so it is 
independent of the physical model used to 
describe the experiment. Non-locality means that 
measuring the properties of a quantum particle in 
one location can instantaneously affect the 
properties of another, even if the two particles 
are in different locations. Quantum nonlocality 
does 
not 
allow 
for 
faster-than-light 
communication [33], and hence is compatible 
with special relativity and its universal speed limit 
of objects. A semi-classical perspective can 
explain the notion of the entanglement; indeed, 
entanglement of photons can be explained in 
terms of the relativistic properties of space-time 
as defined by Einstein as well as by quantum 
mechanics. Yet, regarding photons and the 
theory of special relativity, all photons moving at 
the speed of light, the separation between those 
two points would be zero from the perspective of 
those photons. Those entangled photons which 
share one or more degrees of freedom at the 
quantum level between each photon cannot be 
described independently of the quantum state of 
the others because they share degrees of 
freedom. We can say thus that quantum theory is 
local in the strict sense defined by special 
relativity and, as such, the term "quantum 
nonlocality" 
is 
sometimes 
considered 
a 
misnomer.  
 
2.1.6 Measure 
 
The correlation predicted by quantum mechanics 
is due to the quantum entanglement of the pair, 
with the idea that their state is determined only at 
the point where a measurement is made on one 
or the other. This idea is entirely consistent with 
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, one of the 
most 
fundamental 
concepts 
in 
quantum 
mechanics [34]. 
 
Here, we can understand the implication of the 
concept of information in the measurement 
problem, a measure informs the measurer, to be 
informed, the measurer needs information; taking 
information 
from 
the 
system 
during 
the 
measurement process; with measurement, the 
new 
system 
to 
consider 
is 
the 
system: 
"measurer-the thing to be measured", both parts 
of 
the 
system 
under 
consideration 
share                      
one or more degrees of freedom, being 
entangled [5]. 
 
2.2 Degrees of Freedom 
 
Energy has properties by which we can describe 
it. It has degrees of freedom. “Each spin can be 
taken to represent a bit, and each spin flip 
corresponds to a bit flip. Almost any interaction 
between degrees of freedom is sufficient to 
perform universal quantum logic on these 
degrees of freedom” [35,36]. The historical and 
scientifical approaches has been used to 
constitute 
a 
definition 
of 
degrees 
of                       
freedom, where degrees of freedom refer to the 
number of independent variables needed to 
specify the state of a system, or more accurately, 
each of a number of independently variable 
factors affecting the range of states in which a 
system may exist, in particular any of the 
directions in which independent motion can 
occur.  
 
The definition of degrees of freedom can be 
reformulated 
into 
“minimum 
number 
of 
coordinates 
required 
to 
specify 
a                        
configuration based on the possible directions of 
movement of the system”. As indicated in the 
definition used, degrees of freedom depend on 
coordinates, depend on minimum number of 
ultimate coordinates required to specify a 
configuration. 
The 
ultimate 
basis                          
of the universe is the level of ultimate

positional coordinates which can give rise to 
degrees of freedom, by a process of emergence 
from the formation of a physical significance 
relative to the minimum number of coordinates 
required to specify a configuration. See Appendix 
A. to be able to see an explanatory diagram 
about the emergent entangled informational 
universe. 
 
2.3 Emergence 
 
2.3.1 Introduction 
 
In science, an emergent process occurs when 
we observe that an entity has property that its 
parts do not have alone. The concept of 
emergence is based on the underlying concept 
that "the whole is greater than the sum of all its 
parts." An example of an emergent physical 
property is temperature. Temperature is not 
something that exists at the molecular level. At 
the molecular level, there is only movement, and 
this movement is what is perceived on a larger 
scale as temperature. A single particle has no 
temperature. It has a certain energy or speed, 
but it is not possible to translate this into 
temperature. Only when it comes to random 
velocity distributions of many particles does a 
well-defined temperature emerge. An emergence 
occurs when an entity has properties its parts do 
not have on their own, properties or behaviors 
that emerge only when the parts interact in a 
wider whole.  
 
2.3.2 Weak and Strong emergence 
 
The notion "emergence" may generally be 
subdivided 
into 
two 
perspectives, 
"weak 
emergence" and "strong emergence". Weak 
emergence, in terms of physical systems, is a 
type 
of 
emergence 
where 
the 
interacting 
members retain their independence, in which the 
emergent property is amenable to computer 
simulation or similar forms of after-the-fact 
analysis; independence is considered as crucial 
for these simulations. If the interacting members 
are not independent, a new entity is formed with 
new, emergent properties: this is called strong 
emergence, which it is argued cannot be 
simulated [37]. “The whole is other than the sum 
of its parts”. It is argued then that no simulation 
of the system can exist, for such a simulation 
would itself constitute a reduction of the system 
to its constituent parts [38]. Strong emergence 
describes the direct causal action of a high-level 
system upon its components; qualities produced 
this way are irreducible to the system's 
constituent 
parts 
[39]. 
This 
concept 
of 
emergence dates from at least the time of 
Aristotle [40]. Emergent structures are patterns 
that emerge via the collective actions of many 
individual entities. To explain such patterns, 
according to Aristotle [40], emergent structures 
are more than the sum of their parts assumes 
that the emergent order will not arise if the 
various parts simply act independently of one 
another. The emergence is interpreted as the 
impossibility in practice to explain the whole in 
terms of the parts. Now, one can understand the 
emergence of degrees of freedom from the 
minimum 
number 
of 
ultimate 
positional 
coordinates required to specify a configuration, 
configurations putted in relation to the possible 
directions of movement of the system, from 
which emerge the two fundamental building 
blocks of our universe, i.e., temperature and 
information. See Appendix A. to be able to see 
an explanatory diagram about the emergent 
entangled informational universe.  
 
2.4 Temperature  
 
After taking in account to information as 
fundamental building block of the universe talking 
now about Temperature as second fundamental 
building block of the universe. Regarding the 
third law of thermodynamics which states that 
absolute zero temperature, 0 K, cannot be 
reached by a finite number of steps, we can say 
that temperature is a fundamental aspect of 
nature. 
 
2.5 Energy  
 
2.5.1 Introduction 
 
The application of Landauer's principle to the two 
fundamental building blocks of the universe, i.e., 
temperature and information, leads to an 
important consideration, the two ultimate building 
blocks 
of 
the 
emerging 
universe, 
i.e., 
temperature 
and 
information, 
produce 
the 
emergence of the notion of energy by Landauer's 
principle which identifies temperature as the only 
parameter linking information to energy as 
Energy = k T ln (2). Emerging from the minimum 
required ultimate coordinates forming a specific 
configuration, degrees of freedom give birth to 
temperature 
and 
information 
as 
the 
two 
fundamental building blocks of the universe 
whose relationship gives birth to energy, a 
relationship dictated by Landauer's principle. See 
Appendix A to be able to see an explanatory 
diagram 
about 
the 
emergent 
entangled 
informational universe.

2.5.2 Vacuum energy 
 
Having considered temperature and information 
as the fundamental physics of nature, and after 
having considered their relationship that gives 
birth to energy, let us look at vacuum and the 
energy associated with it. The vacuum state is 
associated with the lowest possible energy state, 
which has measurable effects detected such as 
the Casimir effect. 
 
A vacuum can be thought of not as empty space, 
but as the combination of all zero-point fields. In 
quantum field theory, this combination of fields is 
called the vacuum state, its associated zero-point 
energy is called the vacuum energy, and the 
value of the average energy is called the vacuum 
expectation 
value 
(VEV) 
also 
called 
its 
condensate. One of the most widely used 
examples of an observable physical effect 
resulting from an operator's vacuum expectancy 
value is the Casimir effect. 
 
2.5.3 Casimir effect 
 
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very 
close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta 
which can exist between them. This in turn 
restricts the types and hence number and density 
of virtual particle pairs which can form in the 
intervening vacuum and can result in a negative 
energy density. Since this restriction does not 
exist or is much less significant on the opposite 
sides of the plates, the forces outside the plates 
are greater than those between the plates. This 
causes the plates to appear to pull on each 
other, which has been measured as the Casimir 
effect. More accurately, in the Casimir effect, the 
vacuum energy caused by the virtual particle 
pairs is pushing the plates together, and the 
vacuum energy between the plates is too small 
to negate this effect since fewer virtual particles 
can exist per unit volume between the plates 
than can exist outside them. The Casimir effect 
shows that quantum field theory allows the 
energy density in certain regions of space to be 
negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, 
and it has been shown theoretically that quantum 
field theory allows states where the energy can 
be arbitrarily negative at a given point [41].  
 
2.5.4 Negative energy 
 
The work of Casini and Bousso [8-17] on 
Bekenstein [42] bound sheds light on the Casimir 
effect 
 
             
   
                     
       
  , 
(1) 
 
                 
  , 
(2) 
 
With these definitions, the bound reads  
 
     , 
(3) 
 
which can be rearranged to give: 
 
                       
    , 
(4) 
 
This is simply the statement, following Casini’s 
and Bousso work [8-17], of positivity of quantum 
relative entropy, which proves the Bekenstein 
bound as valid.  
 
This construction allows us to make sense of the 
Casimir effect where the localized energy density 
is lower than that of the vacuum, i.e., a negative 
localized energy. The localized entropy of the 
vacuum is nonzero, and so, the Casimir effect is 
possible for states with a lower localized entropy 
than that of the vacuum i.e., a negative localized 
energy. Negative energies and negative energy 
density are consistent with quantum field theory.  
 
In physics, the negative energy is a concept used 
to explain the nature of certain fields, including 
the gravitational field and various quantum field 
effects.

2.6 Entropy  
 
2.6.1 Introduction 
 
Entropy is almost universally simply called S or 
the statistical entropy or the thermodynamic 
entropy which have equally meaning.  
 
In general, entropy is related to the number of 
possible microstates according to Boltzmann's 
principle: 
 
        , 
(5) 
 
Where:  
 
  is the entropy of the system, 
  is Boltzmann's constant,  
  is the number of microstates.

Boltzmann entropy formula can be derived from 
Shannon entropy formula when all states are 
equally probable. 
 
                          
 
 
        , 
(6) 
 
So, you have    microstate equiprobable with 
probability    
 
 . 
 
The entropy of a thermodynamic system in 
equilibrium measures the uncertainty as to which 
of all its internal configurations compatible with 
its 
macroscopic 
thermodynamic 
parameters 
(temperature, pressure, etc.) is actually realized.  
 
The entropy makes it possible to estimate the 
quantity 
of 
information 
lost 
when 
one 
summarizes the microscopic information by the 
macroscopic information. 
 
"Statistical entropy is a probabilistic measure of 
uncertainty or ignorance; information is a 
measure of a reduction in that uncertainty" [43]. 
 
2.6.2 Coarse- and Fine-grained entropy 
 
In general, a fine-grained description of a system 
is a detailed description of its microscopic 
behavior. A coarse-grained description is one in 
which some of this fine detail has been smoothed 
over. 
 
Coarse graining is at the core of the second law 
of thermodynamics. It is important to recognize 
that a critical property of a coarse-grained 
description is that it is “true” to the system, 
meaning that it is a reduction or simplification of 
the actual microscopic details. 
 
Where fine grained entropy is the entropy of the 
density matrix calculated by the standard 
methods of quantum field theory in curved 
spacetime. In the literature, this is often simply 
called the von Neumann entropy. It is Shannon’s 
entropy with distribution replaced by density 
matrix. It is invariant under unitary time evolution.  
 
                
(7) 
 
Entanglement 
entropy 
is 
a 
measure 
of 
“quantumness” that vanishes for classical states, 
and it is large when quantum correlations are 
important. It is also a measure of complexity [44]. 
 
2.6.3 New entropic perspective 
 
We 
start 
this 
entropic 
information 
theory 
generalization by introducing the mass of 
information 
bit 
formula 
into 
the 
hidden 
thermodynamics of Louis De Broglie: 
 
About the hidden thermodynamics of isolated 
particles, it is an attempt to bring together the 
three furthest principles of physics: the principles 
of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot, that De 
Broglie has had his final idea. Entropy becomes 
a sort of opposite to action with an equation that 
relates the only two universal dimensions of the 
form [45]:

We introduce the mass of bit of information into 
this relation as being:

We obtain the validity proof by the Landauer limit

Indeed, the Landauer limit is the minimum 
possible amount of energy required to erase one 
bit of information, known as the Landauer limit: 
 
As       
 
           
(16) 
 
Landauer’s principle can be derived from 
microscopic considerations [46] as well as 
derived from the well-established properties of 
the Shannon-Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy [22]. The 
principle thus appears to be fundamental and 
universal in application. Landauer’s principle 
applies both to classical and to quantum 
information. 
 
2.6.4 New formulation of entropy 
 
Moreover, as Entropy: 
 
           
(17) 
 
We obtain a new value for the general entropy S 
formula based on the hidden thermodynamics of 
de Broglie with the introduction of mass of bit of 
information: 
 
                     
 
 
(18) 
 
            
 
                                                   (19) 
 
With           expressed in the number of bits 
of information 
 
Based on that view, the entropic information 
theory approach is founded on the bit of 
information such as the number of bits of the 
system, the number of bits necessary to specify 
the actual microscopic configuration among the 
total number of microstates allowed and thus 
characterize the macroscopic states of the 
system under consideration. 
 
The entropic information theory approach can 
formulate a set of five equivalent equations 
expressing entropy, Boltzmann, Einstein, Planck, 
Avogadro and fine structure formulation as seen 
in Fig. 1.

We start from this equation obtained by the 
introduction of mass bits of information into the 
hidden thermodynamics of Louis de Broglie. See

wherein we inject the Hawking Temperature 
represented by this formula:

bit of information,

The ln 2 factor comes from defining the 
information as the logarithm to the base 2 of the 
number of quantum states [16].

2.7.2 The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy 
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking area law claims that 
the area of the black hole horizon is proportional 
to the black hole's entropy. 
 
      
     
         
     
(22) 
 
The Bekenstein Hawking entropy formula, since 
it increases under time evolution, should be 
viewed as the coarse-grained entropy formula for 
the black hole [47]. 
 
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area 
of its event horizon A. This area relationship was 
generalized to arbitrary regions via the Ryu–
Takayanagi 
formula, 
which 
relates 
the 
entanglement entropy of a boundary conformal 
field theory to a specific surface in its dual 
gravitational theory [48].  
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy is a statement 
about the gravitational entropy of a system.  
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy is a measure 
of the information lost to external observers due 
to the presence of the horizon.

With A, the area of the black hole horizon:

2.7.3 The Bekenstein bound 
 
In physics, an upper limit on the thermodynamic 
entropy S, or Shannon entropy H, that can be 
contained within a given finite region of space 
which has a finite amount of energy is the 
Bekenstein 
bound 
(named 
after 
Jacob 
Bekenstein)—or conversely, the maximal amount 
of information required to perfectly describe a 
given physical system down to the quantum level 
[49]. Furthermore, generally, the entropy is 
proportional to the number of bits necessary to 
describe the state of the system considered. This 
result, which was demonstrated by Jacob 
Bekenstein corresponds to the interpretation in 
terms of bits of information. 
 
The universal bound originally founded by         
Jacob Bekenstein in 1981 as the inequality 
[50,51]. 
 
S ≤ 
     
   
(33) 
 
It implies that the information of a physical 
system, or the information necessary to perfectly 
describe that system, must be finite if the region 
of space and the energy are finite. In computer 
science this implies that non-finite models such 
as Turing machines are not realizable as finite 
devices. 
In informational terms, the relation between 
thermodynamic entropy S and Shannon entropy 
H is given by: 
 
Relation between S & H 
 
S= k H ln (2) 
(34) 
 
The black holes entropic information formula 
given as follows: 
 
S= k ln(W) = 
              
      
 
(35) 
 
As S, Boltzmann entropy can be derived from 
Shannon entropy H and following the relation 
between thermodynamic entropy and Shannon 
entropy S=k H ln(2); we obtain:

constant, R is the radius of a sphere that can

The black hole scale is browsed to take in 
account some of them to make our calculations 
on to prove the validity of entropic information 
formula in regard to classic method to determine 
the black hole parameters [52]. 
 
As a side note, it can also be shown that the 
Boltzmann entropy is an upper bound to the 
entropy that a system can have for a fixed 
number of microstates meaning: 
 
S ≤        
(45) 
 
With W reflecting the degree of freedom of a 
system as seen upper. 
 
We must take in account that the Bekenstein–
Hawking boundary entropy of three-dimensional 
black holes exactly saturates the bound.

Casini proves the thermodynamics interpretation 
in the form of Bekenstein bound as valid. Indeed, 
we know following the work of Casini in 2008 [8] 
about the Von Neumann entropy and the 
Bekenstein bound, that the proof of the 
Bekenstein bound is valid using quantum field 
theory [9-17]. 
 
For example, given a spatial region V, Casini 
defines the entropy on the left-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as: 
 
  =S(  )−S(  
 ) = −tr (   log   ) 
+ tr(  
  log   
 ) 
(47) 
 
Sv where S (    is the Von Neumann entropy of 
the reduced density matrix    associated with V, 
V in the excited state  , and S (   
 ) is the 
corresponding Von Neumann entropy for the 
vacuum state   . 
 
Casini defines the right-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as the difference between the 
expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian in 
the excited state and the vacuum state, 
 
   = tr (K    ) − tr (K   
 ) 
(48) 
 
With these definitions, the bound reads SV ≤ KV, 
which can be rearranged to give: 
 
tr (   log    ) − tr (   log   
 ) ≥ 0 
(49) 
 
This is simply the statement of positivity of 
quantum relative entropy, which proves the 
Bekenstein bound. 
 
2.7.4 Von Neumann entropy  
 
Diving into Casini’s work with the black hole’s 
entropic information formula, we obtain new 
enlightening 
about 
black 
hole 
fine-grained 
entropy.

The ingenious proposal of Casini [53] is to 
replace 2   R E, by: 
 
   = tr (K   ) − tr (K   
 ) 
(50) 
 
Indeed, in [9-17], Casini’s work, on the right-hand 
side of the Bekenstein bound, a difficult point is 
to give a rigorous interpretation of the quantity 2 
  R E, where R is a characteristic length scale of 
the system and E is a characteristic energy. This 
product has the same units as the generator of a 
Lorentz boost, and the natural analog of a boost 
in this situation is the modular Hamiltonian of the 
vacuum state K = − log    
 ). 
 
With these definitions, the bound reads 
 
   ≤    
(51) 
 
The version of the Bekenstein bound is    ≤   , 
namely: 
 
S(  ) − S(  
  ) ≤ tr(K   ) − tr(K   
 ) 
(52) 
 
is equivalent to 
 
   ≡ S(  |  
 )≡tr(  (log    – log   
 )) ≥ 0 
(53) 
 
As black holes entropic information formula is 
equal to Bekenstein universal bound.  
 
             
      
      
  
 
(54) 
 
As the difference between the expectation value 
of the modular Hamiltonian in the excited state 
and the vacuum state    = tr (K   ) − tr (K   
 ) is 
equal to Bekenstein universal bound.  
 
We obtain: 
 
            
               
   
 
= −tr (   log   )+ tr(  
  log   
 )

2.7.5 Hawking radiation 
 
In Quantum field theory in curved spacetime 
(QFTCS), a single emission of Hawking radiation 
involves two mutually entangled particles. The 
thermal aspect of Hawking radiation comes from 
separating entangled outgoing Hawking quanta 
and interior Hawking quanta. A quantum of 
Hawking radiation is emitted by the outgoing 
particle escaping; the black hole swallows the 
infalling particle. 
 
The Hawking radiation temperature is [7]: 
 
     
 
   
     
(56) 
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking luminosity of a black 
hole, under the assumption of pure photon 
emission (i.e., that no other particles are emitted) 
and under the assumption that the horizon is the 
radiating surface is: 
 
   
   
             
(57) 
 
where P is the luminosity, i.e., the radiated 
power, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the 
speed of light, G is the gravitational constant and 
M is the mass of the black hole.  
 
The time that the black hole takes to dissipate is: 
 
                  
   
 
          
  
                     
  
 
 
 
(58) 
 
where 
M 
and 
V 
are 
the 
mass 
and 
(Schwarzschild) volume of the black hole. A 
black hole of one solar mass (M ☉ = 2.0× 
     kg) takes more than      years to 
evaporate 
 
Using the entropic information formula of black 
hole entropy:  
 
      
            
      
 
(59) 
 
With a time of evaporation formula: 
 
     = 
        
         
(60) 
 
We obtain for a black hole 1.989    kg a time 
of evaporation of 1,178007186570708 x      
seconds equal to 3,7354363     years. Result 
remarkably close to the result associate to the 
Bekenstein–Hawking luminosity approach where 
the result is      years to evaporate.

Assume that in a finite time in the past a black 
hole has been formed and in the future; will be 
fully evaporated away in some finite time. The 
black hole will only emit a finite amount of 
information encoded within its Hawking radiation. 
The Hawking radiation is to put in relation with 
the (finite) entropy and thus the (non-zero) 
temperature of the black hole: the Hawking 
temperature. Hence the absence of the Hawking 
radiation 
would 
lead 
to 
violations 
of 
thermodynamical laws.  
 
Hawking radiation occurs in an inertial frame 
where spatial distance doesn’t come into it, and, 
where the horizon of a black hole is compact. 
 
Hawking radiation is thermal radiation following 
Boltzmann distribution. 
 
Hawking radiation is in a pure state, is that this is 
in apparent contradiction to the fact that Hawking 
radiation is also said to be thermal. The apparent 
contradiction is solved when one realizes that in 
a general curved spacetime there is no unique 
definition of the vacuum state and therefore the 
whole Hilbert. 
 
Consequently, an observer at infinity will see a 
thermal bath of particles (i.e., in a mixed state) 
coming from the horizon, even though the 
quantum fields are in the local vacuum state near 
the horizon." 
 
2.7.6 Ryu and Takayanagi conjecture 
 
The Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture is a conjecture 
within holography that posits a quantitative 
relationship between the entanglement entropy 
of a conformal field theory and the geometry of 
an associated anti-de Sitter spacetime [18,19]. 
The formula characterizes "holographic screens" 
in the bulk; that is, it specifies which regions of 
the bulk geometry are "responsible to particular 
information in the dual CFT" [54]. 
 
The Ryu–Takayanagi formula calculates the 
entropy of quantum entanglement in conformal 
field theories on Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of 
black holes in the context of Juan Martín 
Maldacena's holographic principle, in which 
conformal field theories on a surface form a 
gravitational theory in a closed volume. 
 
“The 
Bekenstein–Hawking 
area 
law, 
while 
claiming that the area of the black hole horizon is 
proportional to the black hole's entropy, fails to 
provide a sufficient microscopic description of 
how this entropy arises. The holographic 
principle provides such a description by relating 
the black hole system to a quantum system 
which 
does 
admit 
such 
a 
microscopic 
description. In this case, the CFT has discrete 
eigenstates, and the thermal state is the 
canonical ensemble of these states [48]. The 
entropy of this ensemble can be calculated 
through normal means, and yields the same 
result as predicted by the area law. This turns out 
to be a special case of the Ryu–Takayanagi 
conjecture” [55]. 
 
The first version of the fine-grained entropy 
formula was discovered by Ryu and Takayanagi 
[52]. It was subsequently refined and generalized 
by several authors [56-63]. Originally, the Ryu-
Takayanagi formula was proposed to calculate 
holographic entanglement entropy in anti-de 
Sitter spacetime, but the present understanding 
of the formula is much more general. It requires 
neither holography, nor entanglement, nor anti-
de Sitter spacetime. Rather it is a general 
formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum 
systems coupled to gravity [47]. 
 
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area 
of its event horizon A. The black hole entropy 
horizon law which turns out to be a special case 
of the Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture. The black-
hole entropy area relationship was generalized to 
arbitrary 
regions 
via 
the 
Ryu–Takayanagi 
formula, which relates the entanglement entropy 
of a boundary conformal field theory to a specific 
surface in its dual gravitational theory [48], but 
the current understanding of the formula is much 
more general. As being a general formula for the 
fine-grained 
entropy 
of 
quantum 
systems 
coupled to gravity [47]. 
 
Part Three: Entropic information theory: Dark 
Side. 
 
2.8 Information and Dark Matter 
 
Vopson even went so far as to speculate that the 
dark matter that holds galaxies together could 
also be composed of information. He said that 
since for more than 60 years we have been 
trying unsuccessfully to understand what dark 
matter is, it could very well be information. It is 
well-accepted that the matter distribution in the 
Universe is 5% ordinary baryonic matter, 27% 
dark matter and 68%, dark energy [64].  
 
How many bits of information are there in the

Going back as far as the late 1970s, this 
question has been addressed in several studies 
and several answers have been given. For 
example, using the Bekenstein–Hawking formula 
for the black-hole entropy [49,65] the information 
content of the universe has been calculated by 
Davies [66] 
 
          
 
  
             
(61) 
 
Where: 
 
G is the gravitational constant,  
Mu is the mass of the universe enclosed within 
its horizon, 
h is Planck’s constant, 
c is the speed of light.  
 
Wheeler’s approach which estimated the number 
of bits in the present universe at T = 2.735 K 
from entropy considerations, resulting in 8 ×      
bits content [31]. Or Lloyd which took a similar 
approach and estimated the total information 
capacity of the universe as [67]  
 
   
 
                   
  
 
            
(62) 
 
Where:  
 
S is the total entropy of the matter dominated 
universe,  
k is the Boltzmann constant,  
  is the matter density of the universe,  
t is the age of the universe at present,  
c is the speed of light,  
 
The entropic information approach can calculate 
an estimation of the bits of information contained 
in the observable universe from the new 
formulation of entropy, entropy based on the 
mass of the information bit given as follows: 
 
            
 
 
(63) 
 
With 
Einstein 
mass–energy 
equivalence, 
Energy= mc², this is  
 
            
 
 
(64) 
 
We use the mass of the universe and the age of 
this one for the calculations as 
 
                       
 
                                   
                                             
                   
                
 
= 1.5736228  x     bits

, with     -    = 
2.78       .    and  -    = 4.361170766 
               is 1.5736228           bits. 
 
N.B: The relationship between thermodynamic 
entropy S and Shannon entropy H given by 
             is not used to convert the result 
into informational terms because the result of the 
entropic information theory approach to entropy 
is expressed in informational terms, indeed it is 
the mass of the information bit that has been 
implemented to the initial equation considered, 
so the results of the entropy are expressed in the 
number of bits. The theory of entropic information 
is based on the number of bits of the system, the 
number of bits necessary to specify the real 
microscopic 
configuration 
among 
the 
total 
number 
of 
microstates 
allowed 
and 
thus 
characterize the macroscopic states of the 
system considered.  
 
This number of 1.5736228 x      bits estimated 
by calculation from entropic information theory is 
remarkably 
close 
to 
an 
estimate 
of 
the 
information bit content of the universe with      
bits that would be sufficient to account for all the 
dark matter missing in the visible universe 
following Vopson using the reasoning developed 
following [68]. Taking the estimated mass of our 
Milky Way galaxy as  7          solar masses 
[69], and using the mass of the sun     2  
     Kg, then the estimated dark matter mass in 
our galaxy is               3.78          = 7.56 
      Kg. Assuming that all the missing dark 
matter is made up of bits of information, then the 
entire Milky Way galaxy has Nbits (Milky Way) = 
              /     (T=2.73K) = 2.59       bits. 
The estimated number of galaxies in the visible 
universe is  2       [70], so the estimated total 
number of bits of information in the visible 
universe is  52       bits. Remarkably, this 
number is reasonably close to another estimate 
of the Universe information bit content of      
given by Gough in 2008 using Landauer’s 
principle via a different approach [71].

Vopson estimated that around 5,2 ×      bits 
would be enough to account for all the missing 
dark 
matter 
in 
the 
observable 
universe 
[68,72,73]. The estimated bit content of the 
observable universe from entropic information is 
      its. Note that       its is significantly less 
than 
the 
theoretical 
maximum 
information 
content of the universe of        Bits provided by 
applying the holographic principle [49,74] to the 
universe. In the maximum information scenario, 
corresponding to the universe being a single 
black hole,       elementary squares of Planck 
length are needed to cover the surface of the 
current known universe. 
 
2.9 Landauer’s Principle and Dark Energy 
 
From [71], we can read that Landauer’s principle 
was originally proposed to describe the energy 
dissipation when information is overwritten in 
computer systems and subsequently used to 
predict the future limits to shrinking computer 
circuit size [75-81]. Moreover, Landauer showed 
that any erasure of information is necessarily 
accompanied 
by 
heat 
dissipation 
[1]. 
A 
corresponding minimum            of heat energy 
has to be dissipated into the surrounding 
environment to increase the environment’s 
thermodynamic entropy in compensation, and in 
accord with the second law of thermodynamics. 
The total amount of information is conserved as 
the surrounding environment effectively contains 
the erased information, although clearly no 
longer in a form that the computer can use. More 
generally, Landauer’s principle applies to all 
systems 
in 
nature 
so 
that 
any 
system, 
temperature T, in which information is ‘erased’ by 
some physical process will output           of 
heat energy per bit ‘erased’ with a corresponding 
increase in the information of the environment 
surrounding that system. Information is therefore 
directly bound up with the fundamental physics of 
nature. This strong interdependence between 
nature and information is emphasized by 
astrophysicist John Wheeler’s slogan "it from bit" 
and computer scientist Rolf Landauer’s maxim 
“information is physical” Landauer’s principle is 
fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics 
[21,22,24,25].  
 
Information 
entropy 
is 
equivalent 
to 
thermodynamic entropy when the same degrees 
of freedom are considered. The information 
entropy of the physical world is thus the number 
of bits needed to account for all possible 
microscopic states. Then each bit of information 
is equivalent to              of thermodynamic 
entropy leading to Landauer’s principle that 
               of heat is dissipated when a 
computer logic bit is erased [81]. 
 
Landauer's principle identifies temperature as the 
only 
parameter 
connecting 
information 
to         
energy. 
 
The equivalent energy of the total information is 
given by                 . 
 
The equivalent Landauer energy of these 
elementary bits would be defined in a form and 
value identical to the characteristic energy of the 
cosmological constant. 
 
We obtain the equivalent Landauer energy of a 
fundamental bit of information in a universe at 
temperature,      .,      is the total density of 
matter in the universe (baryon + dark). 
 
                           
  
 
      
(66) 
 
This Landauer bit energy is defined identically to 
the characteristic energy of the cosmological 
constant, the cosmological constant is closely 
associated with the concept of dark energy. The 
right-hand side of this equation is identical to 
equation 17.14 of [82] for the characteristic 
energy of the cosmological constant—with the 
sole addition of ln(2) to convert between entropy 
units—between natural information units, nats, 
and bits. Information bit energy might then 
explain the low milli-eV (0.003 eV) characteristic 
energy of Λ, which Peebles [82] considered to be 
too low to be associated with any relevant 
particle physics [83]. 
 
The dark energy density in the universe is about 
7×      g/cm3 
on 
average 
according 
to 
Wikipedia. This is uniform throughout the Hubble 
volume of the entire universe i.e., the volume of 
the universe with which we are in causal contact. 
The Hubble volume is          i.e., cubic light 
years. This gives 8.46732×      cm3 as the 
volume of the universe. Using the mass-energy 
equivalence, you find that the total dark energy 
content in the entire universe is around 
     Joules. 
 
We use the value obtained by the informational 
entropy for the estimation of the number of bits 
corresponding to all the mass content of the 
whole observable universe.

The entropic information theory can provide a 
quantitative account for dark energy, accounting 
for the present energy value, ∼     Joules. The 
entropic 
information 
theory 
provides 
an 
estimation of            Joules remarkably close 
to this estimation. 
 
2.10 Dark 
Energy 
and 
Cosmological 
Constant 
 
Now, let's dive into cosmology, where the 
cosmological constant (lambda: Λ), alternatively 
called Einstein's cosmological constant, is a 
constant term that can be added to Einstein's 
field equations of general relativity. In the field 
equation considered as a "source term", it can be 
thought of as equivalent to the mass of empty 
space or the energy density of space, or the 
energy of vacuum. It is closely associated with 
the concept of dark energy. 
 
In physical cosmology, the energy of the 
cosmological 
vacuum 
appears 
as 
the 
cosmological constant in the Einstein equation or 
Einstein field equation, fundamental equation of 
general relativity. General relativity predicts that 
energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if 
the vacuum energy is "really there", it should 
exert a gravitational force. 
The cosmological constant require that empty 
space takes the role of gravitating negative 
masses which are distributed all over the 
interstellar space' as first stated by Einstein 
[84,85]. 
 
The point is dark energy is a "negative pressure" 
form of energy causing universe expansion. 
 
According 
to 
entropic 
information 
theory 
approach, this "negative pressure" form of 
energy has been explained by the injection of the 
mass of the bit of information in the hidden 
thermodynamics’ formula of louis de Broglie 
leading to an explanation of the negative energy 
by the presence of the negative sign in the 
indicated formula  
      
 
    
       
 
 . 
 
In the Hidden Thermodynamics of Louis de 
Broglie, see [34] 
 
      
 
           
 
 
(70) 
 
By the application of Landauer’s principle 
formula, entropic information theory approach 
has calculated the dark energy as being the 
energy associated to the number of bits of 
information of the observable universe based on 
entropic information theory new alternative 
entropy formulation. 
 
The equivalent Landauer energy of these 
elementary bits would be defined in a form and 
value identical to the characteristic energy of the 
cosmological constant [39]. This Landauer bit 
energy is defined identically to the characteristic 
energy of the cosmological constant. Estimation 
of the energy associated with the number of bits 
of information in the observable universe based 
on entropic information theory is considered as 
being the estimation of dark energy. This 
estimate of dark energy is associated with the 
equivalent Landauer energy for each bit of 
information or bit of entropy, an association 
based on Landauer's principle. This equivalent 
Landauer energy is defined identically to the 
characteristic 
energy 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant. Dark energy is therefore associated 
with the cosmological constant. See Table 1 
about value over time and temperature of dark 
energy (DE) considered as Λ, cosmological 
constant according to the formula of dark energy 
based on Landauer’s principle from the entropic 
information theory with this formula

The dark energy can be associated to the 
cosmological constant and the cosmological 
constant can be formulated to be equivalent to 
the zero-point radiation of space, i.e., the 
vacuum energy [86].  
 
2.11 Cosmological Constant and Zero-
Point-Energy 
 
The zero-point-energy is usually supposed to 
contribute to the cosmological constant. The 
mismatch between the small cosmological 
constant compared with the huge zero-point-
energy is considered as one of the most serious 
problems in physics. 
 
Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is 
expected to contribute to the cosmological 
constant, which affects the expansion of the 
universe. 
 
Using quantum field theory one can calculate the 
quantum mechanical vacuum energy (or zero-
point energy) for any quantum field. The result of 
this calculation can be as high as 120 orders of 
magnitude larger than the upper limits obtained 
via cosmological observations.  
 
In quantum mechanics, the vacuum energy is not 
zero due to quantum fluctuations. The ground 
state energy of the harmonic oscillator is 
  
  in 
contrast to the classical harmonic oscillator 
whose ground state energy is zero.  
 
The formalism of quantum field theory makes it 
clear 
that 
the 
vacuum 
expectation 
value 
summations are in a certain sense summation 
over so-called "virtual particles". 
 
Quantum fields can be described as an infinite 
collection of harmonic oscillators, so naively the 
vacuum energy, which would be a sum over all 
the harmonic oscillator ground state energies, 
should be infinite. But, in practice, we would 
expect the sum to be cut off at some energy 
scale above which the true (presently unknown) 
fundamental theory must be invoked. 
 
The cosmological constant Λ was introduced by 
Albert Einstein into general relativity in 1917. 
Including the cosmological constant, Einstein’s 
field equations are: 
 
     
               
      
(71) 
 
The cosmological constant can be interpreted as 
the energy density of the vacuum. Specifically, if 
we introduce 
 
   
          
       
(72) 
 
Then (71) can be rewritten as 
 
     
               
            
        
 
(73) 
 
if we compare (72) with the energy-momentum 
tensor of a perfect fluid, 
 
        
            
(74) 
 
then we would conclude that the energy density 
of the vacuum is: 
 
          
    
(75)

71 
 
and the equation of state of the vacuum is 
      
 
The current astrophysical data can be interpreted 
as being consistent with a nonzero value of the 
cosmological constant. The latest data can be 
found in the table of Astrophysical constants and 
parameters in [37]. This table includes the 
following two entries, 
 
  
   
                    
(76) 
 
              
        
(77) 
 
where    
    
     
   
      and    is the present-day 
Hubble parameter.  
 
The vacuum energy density is given by (75) and 
the critical density today is given by      
    
    
 
Hence 
 
        
    
    
   
  
(78) 
 
Employing the numbers given in eq. (76) and 
(77), it follows that: 
 
     
 
                             
(79) 
 
Using (79), we obtain, 
 
         
     
                              
                           
                   
(80) 
 
Thus, the numerical value of the vacuum energy 
is:  
 
                                   
(81) 
 
after 
using 
the 
conversion 
     
              and              . 
 
In order to see whether this vacuum energy is 
large or small, we need to invoke quantum 
mechanics. In quantum mechanics, there is a 
natural association between length scales and 
energy scales. The key conversion factor is: 
 
                              
(82) 
 
where              . 
Thus 
 
                          
(83) 
 
Using this conversion factor, we can write, 
 
       
             
                      
                  
     
 
(84) 
 
Given our lack of knowledge of the fundamental 
theory above the Planck energy scale, a 
reasonable first guess would be to cut off the 
vacuum energy sum at the Planck scale. Thus, 
the “prediction” of quantum mechanics is that the 
energy density of the vacuum due to vacuum 
fluctuations should be roughly given by: 
 
    
             
   
 
     
   
 
     
           
     
 
     
  
        
      
(85) 
 
Putting in the numbers, 
 
    
        
                   
     
  
                  
     
 
(86) 
 
Thus, the quantum mechanical prediction for the 
vacuum energy is given by (86). How good is this 
prediction? Let us compare this to the observed 
vacuum energy given in (84), 
 
      
    
                  
           
 
               
(87) 
 
The observed vacuum energy density is a factor 
of       smaller than its predicted value! 
 
This is by far the worst prediction in the history of 
physics!! 
 
So, how do we fix this? 
 
It is believed that there exists some mechanism 
that makes Λ small but non-zero. 
 
The order of the obtained result is dictated by the 
utilization of the Planck mass in the calculation, 
indeed, with the                     which 
multiply the value of conversion between 
kilograms 
and 
electron 
volt, 
                                , we obtain:

But if we do the calculation with the replacement 
of     by                                   
[3] multiply by the value of conversion, kg to eV:  
 
1kg=5.60958616721986          eV, we obtain  
 
                                       
                  
(89) 
 
      
    
       
           
                 
 
                  
                      
(90) 
 
By taking account of the mass of the bit of 
information instead of the Planck mass in the 
cosmological constant calculation we have 
reduced the discrepancy of 120 orders of 
magnitude in the prediction of the vacuum 
energy from a quantum perspective. 
 
One way to envisage the dark energy is that it 
seems to be linked to the vacuum of space. In 
other words, it is an intrinsic property of the 
vacuum. The larger the volume of space, the 
more vacuum energy (dark energy) is present 
and the greater its effects. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Entropic 
Information 
Theory: 
Structural Basis 
 
After giving the physical explanation of the notion 
of energy by the fundamentality of temperature 
and information and the emergence process 
engaged, 
the 
entropic 
information 
theory 
approach gives the physical explanation of the 
collapse of the wave function and some definition 
in 
informational 
perspective 
of 
quantum 
foundation terms with the concept of Information 
defined as “a quantum state change due to the 
modification of a degree of freedom in the 
quantum 
system 
considered”; 
while 
the 
entanglement process can be defined as “the 
physical phenomenon that occurs when a group 
of particles is generated, interacts or shares 
spatial proximity such that one or more degrees 
of freedom are shared at the quantum level 
between each particle in the group; a particle 
cannot be described independently of the 
quantum state of others because they share 
degrees of freedom, even when the particles are 
separated by a great distance”.  
 
Following 
entropic 
information 
theory, 
this 
considers the quantum measurement of a 
quantum 
system 
as 
an 
interactive 
and 
informative process that reduces uncertainty on 
the quantum system by exploiting quantum 
entanglement sharing some degrees of freedom 
between the measurer and the system to be 
measured. This definition of quantum measure is 
consistent 
with 
the 
given 
definitions 
of 
information and entanglement. It is a process in 
which the measure informs the measurer, the 
measurer needs to be informed about the system 
under considerations; to be informed about the 
system, the measurer needs information from the 
system to be measured, the measurer take 
information out the system under considerations, 
the measurer shares one or more degrees of 
freedom (information) with the system under 
considerations, and both are entangled together 
by the sharing of degrees of freedom [5]. This 
gives an explicative informational process about 
the physical process of the collapse of the wave 
function based on the definition of the quantum 
measurement, 
invaliding 
the 
Many 
worlds 
interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
 
The entropic information theory is based on the 
ultimate positional coordinates which are the 
ultimate aspect of the universe, the ultimate 
basis, ultimate basis from which the degrees of 
freedom emerge, degrees of freedom as being 
defined as a physical significance emerging from 
a minimum number of positional coordinates 
required to specify a configuration. From those 
minimum 
required 
configurations 
putted 
in 
relation to the possible directions of movement of 
the system, emerge the two fundamental building 
blocks of our universe, i.e., temperature and 
information.  See Appendix A: to be able to see 
an explanatory diagram about the emergent 
entangled informational universe. Temperature 
and Information are being perceived, as a 
physical significance in relation to degrees of 
freedom. Temperature can be considered as a 
fundamental aspect of nature, in reference to the 
third law of thermodynamics. Information can be 
equally considered as a fundamental aspect of 
nature 
in accord to the second law of 
thermodynamics and the Landauer’s principle. 
Degrees 
of 
freedom, 
temperature 
and 
information 
are 
considered 
as 
emergent 
properties and having a physical significance but 
not physical existence. The physical existence 
born by the emergence of energy from the 
relation between the two fundamentals building 
blocks of the universe, i.e., temperature and 
information according to the Landauer’s principle, 
Landauer’s principle which establishes the 
temperature as the unique parameter which

bound information to energy, by the formula  
                 . Energy being considered as 
a process that emerges from the relationship 
between temperature and information, relative to 
the formula of Landauer's principle.  
 
Emergent Entangled informational Universe must 
be considered as an emergent system, a system 
based on emergence process where emergence 
occurs when an entity has properties its parts do 
not have on their own, properties or behaviors 
that emerge only when the parts interact in a 
wider whole. 
 
In 
mathematics, 
the 
simplest 
example 
concerning emergence is 1+1=2, 2 being 
emergent in regard to 1.  
 
3.2 Entropic 
Information 
Theory: 
Generalization 
 
After having developed a set of five new 
equivalent formulation of the notion of entropy, 
the thermodynamics aspect of black holes has 
been aborded by the injection of the Hawking 
temperature into the equation of “Boltzmann 
formulation”, one of those formulas, this made 
possible to the entropic information formula of 
black holes to calculate the entropy of the 
entangled Hawking radiation down to the 
quantum system, describing black hole. The 
black 
holes 
entropic 
information 
formula  saturates exactly the universal bound. 
The black holes entropic information formula is 
equal to the universal bound originally found by 
Jacob Bekenstein [61,9] which is equal by 
Casini’s work [8] to the difference between the 
expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian in 
the excited state and the vacuum state. 
 
Naive definitions of entropy and energy density in 
Quantum Field Theory suffer from ultraviolet 
divergences. In the case of the Bekenstein 
bound, ultraviolet divergences can be avoided by 
taking differences between quantities computed 
in an excited state and the same quantities 
computed in the vacuum state [87]. We must 
take note that the first version of the fine-grained 
entropy 
formula 
discovered 
by 
Ryu 
and 
Takayanagi is a general formula for the fine-
grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to 
gravity [47]. 
 
The 
formula 
about 
black 
hole 
entropic 
information is a new formulation of Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy, new formulation based on 
information; it is equal to Bekenstein bound, as 
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy saturates exactly 
the Bekenstein bound and equal to Von 
Neumann entropy which is the fine grained 
entropy, as in Casini’s work, the von Neumann 
entropy 
calculates 
the 
Bekenstein 
bound, 
moreover the black hole entropy horizon law 
turns out to be a special case of the Ryu–
Takayanagi conjecture, conjecture viewed as a 
general formula for the fine-grained entropy of 
quantum systems coupled to gravity.  
 
Finally, we obtain.

definition of the vacuum state and therefore the 
whole Hilbert. Consequently, an observer at 
infinity will see a thermal bath of particles (i.e., in 
a mixed state) coming from the horizon, even 
though the quantum fields are in the local 
vacuum state near the horizon. 
 
But if the overall system is pure, the entropy of 
one subsystem can be used to measure its 
degree 
of 
entanglement 
with 
the 
other 
subsystems. 
"In fact, this is precisely what happens with 
Hawking radiation. The radiation is entangled 
with the fields living in the black hole interior 
[47]." 
 
In fact, if we had a very complex quantum 
system which starts in a pure state, it will appear 
to thermalize and will emit radiation that is very 
close to thermal. In particular, in the early stages, 
if we computed the von Neumann entropy of the 
emitted radiation it would be almost exactly 
thermal because the radiation is entangled with 
the quantum system. 
 
“In other words, if the black hole degrees of 
freedom together with the radiation are producing 
a pure state, then the fine-grained entropy of the 
black hole should be equal to that of the radiation 
           =      [47]." 
 
"The Hawking radiation, are allowing us to 
extract information that resides (from the 
semiclassical viewpoint) in a distant spacelike-
separated region: the black hole interior [88]." 
 
"Importantly this fundamental nonlocality is not 
solely a feature of black hole physics; instead, it 
is an essential aspect of holography [88]". 
 
“The entropy deliverable to an asymptotic 
observer by a spacetime causally explored to an 
inner boundary of area A cannot be greater than 
A=4G  [89].” 
 
The black hole von Neumann entropy never gets 
bigger that the thermodynamic entropy set by the 
horizon area law.

3.3 Entropic Information Theory: Dark 
Side 
 
The notion of negative energy, in relation to 
vacuum, is examined in more detail, in the light 
of Casini [8] and Bousso's work on the 
Bekenstein bound [9-17], both works giving 
meaning to the Casimir effect. The negative 
energy phenomenon is explained using Louis de 
Broglie's 
hidden 
thermodynamic 
formula, 
      
 
    
       
 
, 
used 
in 
the 
entropic 
information theory approach, itself in relation to 
Casini's work. 
 
One way to envisage the dark energy is that it 
seems to be linked to the vacuum of space. In 
other words, it is an intrinsic property of the 
vacuum. The larger the volume of space, the 
more vacuum energy (dark energy) is present 
and the greater its effects. 
 
The 
zero-point 
energy 
of 
the 
vacuum                          
considered 
as 
dark 
energy 
is 
explained                               
as 
a 
collective 
potential 
of 
all 
particles                              
with 
their 
individual 
zero-point 
energy                              
emerging from an informational field, distinct 
from the usual fields of matter of quantum                      
field theory, associated with the dark matter as 
having a finite and quantifiable mass associated 
with the number of bits of the observable 
universe. 
 
Dark matter emerging by the Landauer’s 
principle, from the two fundamental building 
blocks of our universe, i.e., temperature and 
information 
and 
dark 
matter 
giving 
rise, 
according to the Landauer’s principle, to Dark 
energy, the zero-point energy of the vacuum 
considered. 
 
By 
taking 
account 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the                                  
bit 
of 
information 
instead 
of 
the 
Planck                               
mass 
in 
the 
cosmological 
constant                                    
calculation we have reduced the discrepancy of 
more of less 120 orders of magnitude in the 
prediction of the vacuum energy from a quantum 
perspective. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
 
In the first part of this work, after having defined 
some fundamental notion of quantum mechanics 
in informational terms as quantum information, 
quantum entanglement , quantum measurement, 
and 
after 
having 
given 
an 
explanatory 
informational perspective of the process of the 
collapse of the wave function based of the fact 
that a measure informs the measurer, invaliding 
the Many worlds Interpretation of quantum 
mechanics, this entropic information theory 
approach explains how physical existence arises 
by the emergence of energy from the relationship 
between the two fundamental building blocks of 
the universe, temperature, and information, with 
respect to the second law of thermodynamics 
and according to the formula of Landauer's 
principle which establishes temperature as the 
only parameter linking information to energy. 
Having explained the process of emergence at 
the base of the notion of energy, we can notice 
that an important consequence of the emergent 
entangled 
Informational 
Universe 
where 
interacting members are not independent, being 
entangled, 
sharing 
degrees 
of 
freedom 
(information), that no simulation of the system 
can exist, the process of strong emergence 
doesn’t permit the simulation of the system, for 
such a simulation would itself constitute a 
reduction of the system to its constituent parts. 
The simulation hypothesis is so invalided. Still 
according 
to 
the 
model 
of 
the 
entropic 
information theory, the amount of information in 
the universe is constant; only changes the 
proportion of its known or decoded state 
regarding its ignored or hidden state, indeed, 
information is one and the same thing, however it 
can exist in two forms: ignored or known, i.e., 
hidden or decoded. This emergent entangled 
informational universe is an informational system 
i.e., a system wherein the information notion is 
the 
global 
explanatory 
keystone 
concept, 
considered as an entangled system i.e., a 
system where there are not individual parts but 
are an inseparable whole, and as an emergent 
system i.e., system where the whole is greater 
than the sum of all its parts. 
 
In the second part of this work, with the help of 
one of a set of five new equivalent equations 
expressing the notion of entropy, regarding black 
holes thermodynamics and black holes entropy, 
the equation of “Boltzmann formulation” when is 
applied to black hole thermodynamics by the 
injection of Hawking Temperature to it, can 
resolve the information paradox and can express 
the gravitational fine-grained entropy of the black 
holes. It can calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy; as the black hole entropy saturates 
exactly the Bekenstein bound so it is equal to the 
Bekenstein bound which is itself according to 
Casini’s work equal to the von Neumann entropy, 
itself equal to that of the Hawking radiation, 
which with the degrees of freedom of black holes

produces a pure state, while the Hawking 
radiation being entangled with the fields inside 
black holes, allowing us to extract information 
that resides from the semiclassical viewpoint, in 
the black hole interior; at the end of evaporation, 
the full von Neumann entropy is again 0 , so no 
information is lost!. The black hole entropy 
horizon law turns out to be a special case of the 
Ryu–Takayanagi 
conjecture, 
and 
Ryu–
Takayanagi conjecture is a conjecture viewed as 
a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of 
quantum systems coupled to gravity. 
 
In the third part of this work, an equivalent 
reformulation of the “Boltzmann formulation” 
equation, the “Einstein formulation” equation has 
estimated the dark matter component, by 
calculating the number of bits content of the 
observable universe and validated by Landauer's 
principle. The estimate of dark energy is based 
on the estimation of the energy associated with 
the number of bits content of the observable 
universe, with respect Landauer’s principle. The 
equivalent energy of the total information, given 
by                , is proportional to both the total 
number of bits and the temperature, and 
therefore proportional to the volume of the 
universe 
as 
in 
the 
volume 
model, 
and 
proportional to the surface of the universe in the 
holographic 
model. 
The 
dark 
energy 
is 
associated to the cosmological constant being 
expressed into the Landauer energy equivalent, 
which can be defined in a form and value 
identical to the characteristic energy of the 
cosmological 
constant. 
The 
dark 
energy 
component is equally associated to vacuum 
energy, zero-point field energy. By taking 
account of the mass of the bit of information 
instead of the Planck mass in the cosmological 
constant calculation the entropic information 
theory approach has reduced the discrepancy of 
120 orders of magnitude in the prediction of the 
vacuum energy from a quantum perspective. The 
zero-point energy of the vacuum considered as 
dark energy is explained as a collective potential 
of all particles with their individual zero-point 
energy emerging from an informational field, 
distinct from the usual fields of matter of quantum 
field theory, associated with dark matter as 
having a finite and quantifiable mass.
