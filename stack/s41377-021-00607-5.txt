Abstract
Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are recently discovered topological phases, possessing symmetry-
protected corner states with fractional charges. An unexpected connection between these states and the seemingly
unrelated phenomenon of bound states in the continuum (BICs) was recently unveiled. When nonlinearity is added to
the HOTI system, a number of fundamentally important questions arise. For example, how does nonlinearity couple
higher-order topological BICs with the rest of the system, including continuum states? In fact, thus far BICs in nonlinear
HOTIs have remained unexplored. Here we unveil the interplay of nonlinearity, higher-order topology, and BICs in a
photonic platform. We observe topological corner states that are also BICs in a laser-written second-order topological
lattice and further demonstrate their nonlinear coupling with edge (but not bulk) modes under the proper action of
both self-focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. Theoretically, we calculate the eigenvalue spectrum and analog of
the Zak phase in the nonlinear regime, illustrating that a topological BIC can be actively tuned by nonlinearity in such a
photonic HOTI. Our studies are applicable to other nonlinear HOTI systems, with promising applications in emerging
topology-driven devices.
Introduction
Over the past decade, topological insulators have
attracted tremendous attention across many disciplines
of natural sciences1,2, including photonics3. One of their
most appealing features is the topologically protected
edge states immune to scattering at defects and dis-
order4–6. A few years ago, a novel class of higher-order
topological insulators (HOTIs) was predicted7–11 and
experimentally observed12–14. While a traditional topo-
logical insulator usually obeys the bulk–boundary cor-
respondence principle (with edge states one dimension
lower than the bulk), HOTIs typically support zero-
dimensional corner states regardless of their physical
dimension, or more generally, (d–n)-dimensional states
at the boundaries of d-dimensional lattices with n no less
than 23,15. This is associated with topologically quantized
quadrupole and higher-order electric moments in elec-
tronic systems7. The discovery of HOTIs broadened the
concept of the symmetry-protected topological phase and
our common understanding of traditional topological
insulators, which has thus launched a host of research
ventures on HOTIs in a variety of ﬁelds, including con-
densed matter physics, electric circuits, acoustics, and
photonics7,10,12–14,16–32. In terms of fundamental interest,
HOTIs are attractive because they are related to many
intriguing phenomena, such as higher-order band topology
in twisted Moiré superlattices33, topological lattice dis-
clinations34, and Majorana bound states35 and their non-
trivial braiding36. Toward applications, they have been
touted and tested for robust photonic crystal nanocavities37
and low-threshold topological corner state lasing29,38.
Combining topology and nonlinearity leads to a number
of fundamental questions, some of which have been
addressed in the study of ﬁrst-order nonlinear topological

photonic systems39, including, for example, nonlinear
topological solitons and edge states, nonlinearity-induced
topological phase transitions, topological nonlinear fre-
quency
conversion,
and
nonlinear
tuning
of
non-
Hermitian topological states40–47. However, thus far, all
of the studies on HOTIs have mainly been restricted to
the linear regime, and only recently it became clear that
unexpected phenomena may arise when nonlinearity is
taken into account in HOTI systems48–50, with experi-
ments implemented already in nonlinear electric circuits48
and photonic structures51–53.
In a few recent papers, an intriguing connection between
HOTIs and another widely studied phenomenon, namely,
the bound states in the continuum (BICs), has been
explored22,54,55, reinvigorating the interest in BICs and
their topological nature, as previously established56–58.
BICs are counter-intuitive localized states with eigenvalues
in the continuum of extended states, which may result
from versatile mechanisms57–60. An exemplary model used
for unveiling such a connection is the celebrated two-
dimensional (2D) Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) lattice61,
which possesses the second-order localized modes pro-
tected by both chiral symmetry and crystalline symmetry54,
as observed in a variety of synthetic structures12–14
including photonic crystals18,19. In such HOTIs, the
corner-localized states appear right at the center of the
eigenvalue spectrum (zero-energy mode) and are embed-
ded in the continuum rather than in the gap, in contrast to
other types of HOTIs20,24,62. Such topological BICs have
inﬁnite lifetimes and are fully localized to the corner
despite being embedded in the bulk band, but they become
“leaky” when the required symmetries are broken54,55.
Nonlinearity can be used to break these symmetries and
thus enable coupling of light into/out of these localized
corner states or facilitating their interaction, therefore
making them attractive for potential applications. However,
to the best of our knowledge, nonlinear higher-order BICs
and their associated dynamics have not been explored so
far in photonics or any other systems. (Although a recent
work63 reported nonlinear second-order photonic topolo-
gical insulators, the presence of topologically nontrivial
corner-localized states in crystalline insulators based on the
breathing Kagome lattices has become a topic of debate.
Furthermore, corner-localized higher-order BICs do not
exist in those systems.)
Here we establish a nonlinear photonic HOTI platform
and explore the role of nonlinearity in higher-order
topological BICs (Fig. 1a, b). We demonstrate that a low
nonlinearity, either self-focusing or self-defocusing, can
induce coupling between corner states and edge states in a

2D SSH nontrivial lattice, enabling their beating oscilla-
tions. Nonlinearity can break the symmetries in the lat-
tice. Consequently, an excitation of the corner-localized
BICs is expected to radiate into the bulk. Yet we show
that, counter-intuitively, the excitation of the corners
leads to the beating between the corner BICs and the edge
modes with appropriate nonlinearity strengths rather than
coupling to the bulk modes. Surprisingly, even a self-
defocusing nonlinearity does not favor the coupling with
the bulk modes. Only at a high nonlinearity, a corner state
can become more localized and form a semi-inﬁnite gap
soliton out of the continuum, or it can exhibit strong
radiation into the edge and bulk. We theoretically analyze
the dynamical evolution of the nonlinear eigenvalue
spectrum and validate the robustness of the corner modes
in the process of beating with the edge modes driven by a
low nonlinearity. This is supported by calculating the bulk
polarizations manifesting the topological invariant in the
nonlinear regime as well as by simulating long-distance
beam propagation. Our work not only provides another
direct experimental evidence of the topological BICs
recently predicted in linear systems54 but also, more
importantly, unveils the intriguing nonlinear dynamics of
topological BICs in HOTIs.
Results
The wave dynamics in our HOTI system can be
described by the continuous nonlinear Schrödinger-like
equation (NLSE), typically used for simulating a light
ﬁeld with amplitude ψ(x, y, z) propagating along the
longitudinal z-direction of the photorefractive photonic
lattice64:

where IL(x, y) accounts for the beam intensity required for
writing the 2D SSH lattice in a nonlinear photorefractive
crystal, IP is the nonlinear contribution of the probe beam
that is proportional to |ψ(x, y, z)|2, k is the wavenumber in
the crystal, and Δn is the linear refractive index change
determined by the bias ﬁeld E0 and by the electro-optic
coefﬁcient of the crystal (see Supplementary Material).
The induced refractive index change forming the linear
photonic lattice depends on the spatial coordinates x and
y, and it is uniform along the propagation axis as
illustrated in Fig. 1a. The nonlinearity can be self-
focusing or self-defocusing, depending on the direction
of the bias ﬁeld relative to the crystalline optical axis,
while its strength can be controlled by the bias ﬁeld and
the beam intensity64,65. It should be pointed out that, for
low power probe beams (small IP), the nonlinearity is in
the low saturable regime and approximately Kerr-like,
then the above NLSE is equivalent to the Gross–Pitaevskii
equation that describes interacting atomic Bose–Einstein
condensates in the mean-ﬁeld approximation2. As such,
even though we used a speciﬁc type of optical nonlinearity
in our study, the concept and scheme of nonlinear control
of HOTI corner modes developed here are expected to
hold in other platforms beyond photonics.
The topological features of the 2D SSH lattice are more
transparent in the discrete model based on the coupled-
mode theory. When the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN)
coupling is negligible, Eq. (1) can be approximated with

where ψα is the complex amplitude of the electric ﬁeld at
the site α, HL is the linear Hamiltonian matrix of the 2D
SSH model; its entries [HL]α,α′ are either zero (when α and
α′ are not neighboring sites), or take the value of either
the intracell coupling t or the intercell coupling t′, as
illustrated in Fig. 1b. Both the normalized bias ﬁeld
E00 and the nonlinear coefﬁcient γ control the saturable
nonlinearity, which corresponds to the nonlinear photo-
refractive crystal used in the experiment64,65.
In the linear regime, in full analogy with the one-
dimensional case66,67, the 2D SSH lattices exhibit two
distinct Zak phases, which correspond to bulk polariza-
tions. These are the topological invariants for this type of
HOTIs18,19,61, which differentiate the topologically trivial
and nontrivial structures (see “Methods”). They can be
tuned by the dimerization parameter c = t – t′. In the
discrete model, the topological characteristics of the 2D
SSH lattices can be clearly seen from the linear eigenvalue
spectrum calculated from HLφL,n = –βL,nφL,n, as sum-
marized in Fig. 1c, d, where βL,n is the linear spectrum and
φL,n are the corresponding eigenmodes. When the intra-
cell coupling is weaker than the intercell coupling (c < 0),
the system is in the topologically nontrivial phase, and the
band structure consists of characteristic edge and corner
modes (Fig. 1c). In particular, in the middle of the band,
there are four degenerated corner modes (Fig. 1d1), cor-
responding to “zero-energy modes” in the condensed
matter language. A typical corner mode structure is
shown in the upper inset of Fig. 1d1, which clearly dis-
plays the features of the topological corner state (highly
localized at the corner with zero amplitude in its nearest-
neighbor sites but nonzero out-of-phase amplitude in its
NNN sites along the edges). Since these corner states are
embedded in the continuum of the SSH lattice as well as
protected by the C4v and chiral symmetries, they are
topological
BICs54,55.
Their
exponential
localization
characteristics are further analyzed with a larger topolo-
gical lattice structure (see Supplementary Materials). For
comparison, the trivial phase, manifested by vanishing
polarizations, occurs when the intracell coupling is

Page 3 of 10

stronger than the intercell coupling (c > 0), leading to two
mini-gaps formed only by the bulk modes (Fig. 1d3).
When the coupling strength is uniform across the whole
lattice (c = 0), it turns to a trivial square lattice with a
gapless spectrum (Fig. 1d2), which sets apart the topolo-
gically nontrivial and trivial regimes. Representative edge
and bulk modes are also displayed in the insets of Fig. 1d.
In the nonlinear regime, the eigenvalues are calculated
from HNLφNL,n = −βNL,n(Z)φNL,n(Z) where the nonlinear
Hamiltonian HNL = HL + VNL contains both the linear
part and the nonlinear potential corresponding to the
third term in Eq. (2). It is important to point out that the
nonlinear eigenmodes φNL,n(Z) and nonlinear eigenva-
lues βNL,n(Z) are Z-dependent (here Z is the normalized
propagation distance playing the role of time) because the
nonlinear beam dynamics are generally not stationary.
Indeed, we use a general theoretical protocol (developed
recently in ref. 44) for interpreting the dynamics in non-
linear topological systems, where both inherited and
emergent topological phenomena may arise. The calcu-
lated nonlinear eigenvalue spectrum (at Z = 50) for the
nontrivial SSH lattice is plotted in Fig. 2a, where two sets
of edge modes set apart the whole band as in the linear
spectrum (Fig. 1d1). However, under the action of non-
linearity, the spectrum exhibits a dynamical evolution
during propagation, while the corner modes are forced to
couple with the lower (upper) edge states by a self-
focusing (self-defocusing) nonlinearity (see Supplemen-
tary Movies). In other words, they are no longer
stationary BICs but rather undergo periodic energy
exchange with the edge modes. The robustness of the
corner localized BICs is evident, as they do not want to
couple with the bulk modes even when they are driven in
and out of the central bulk band via nonlinearity,
reﬂecting the inherited topological nature of BICs. The
detailed analysis of the intensity proﬁle of these nonlinear
corner modes on the logarithmic scale, along with their
long-range propagation dynamics, can be found in the
Supplementary Material. For the snapshot selected at
Z = 50 (shown in Fig. 2a), the whole spectrum is down-
shifted from its linear position by the focusing non-
linearity, while the corner modes are approaching and
coupling with the lower edge modes. This shifting
direction is reversed when a self-defocusing nonlinearity
is employed. When the strength of nonlinearity is low
(E00 = 5, γ = 1.1), a representative corner mode excited by
the focusing nonlinearity undergoes beating with the
edge modes (Fig. 2b2, b4), but only at a sufﬁciently high
nonlinearity (E00 = 5, γ = 3.5) it is “liberated” from the
continuum and turns into a self-trapped semi-inﬁnite gap
soliton (Fig. 2b3). Such corner solitons, which are formed
only in the strongly nonlinear regime with eigenvalues
(i.e., propagation constants) residing beyond the lattice
Bloch band, have been explored previously in 2D square
lattices65,68 but not in the context of HOTIs.
In our experiments, we establish the nonlinear photonic
HOTI platform by site-to-site writing of the 2D SSH
lattices in a photorefractive crystal, carried out with a

Fig. 2 Calculated nonlinear band structure and corner mode tuning under a self-focusing nonlinearity. a Calculated nonlinear eigenvalues of
the 2D SSH lattice βNL for the nontrivial lattice using the discrete model, where the transparent dots are linear modes superimposed for direct
comparison. The black arrow shows that four corner states (red dots) undergo coupling and beating with lower edge states under low self-focusing
nonlinearity (see also Supplementary video), and the red arrow marks the initially excited corner mode that sustains the topological feature under
linear conditions as shown in b1 without any light distribution in the nearest neighboring sites. Under a low focusing nonlinearity, the corner mode
couples with the edge modes (b2), and a beating oscillation occurs. This can be clearly seen from the side-view propagation of b4, taking from the
upper-left edge marked by a dashed line in b2. Under a high focusing nonlinearity, a localized semi-inﬁnite gap discrete soliton forms at the corners,
with light distributing in the nearest neighboring sites (b3)

continuous-wave (CW) laser69. Experimental details can
be found in “Methods.” For direct comparison, the lattices
are written into three different structures (nontrivial SSH,
square, and trivial SSH, as illustrated in the left panels of
Fig. 3) by tuning the dimerization parameter, in accor-
dance with Fig. 1d1–d3, which in the experiment is
achieved by controlling the intracell and intercell wave-
guide distances. We then excite the same corner site with
a single Gaussian probe beam. Results obtained under
linear excitation are shown in Fig. 3, where the probe
beam itself has no nonlinear self-action but evolves into a
characteristic corner state with a non-zero intensity dis-
tribution at the two NNN sites along the edges (Fig. 3a2),
representing a typical topological BIC realized in the
nontrivial SSH lattice. For all other cases of excitation,
either at the edge and bulk of the nontrivial lattices or at
the same corner of the trivial lattices, the probe beam is
not localized but instead displays strong radiation into the
bulk/edge as shown in Fig. 3a2–c2. To simulate such
linear corner excitation, we set IP = 0 in Eq. (1) and dis-
play the results obtained from numerical simulations for
three different lattices in Fig. 3a3–c3, a4–c4, which agree
well with our experimental observations.
We now discuss the experimental results pertinent to
the nonlinear control of HOTI corner states as illustrated
in Fig. 1a, b and analyzed in Fig. 2. Measurements of the
output intensity proﬁle of the probe beam under a corner
excitation of the nontrivial lattice with both self-focusing
and self-defocusing nonlinearities after 20 mm propaga-
tion are shown in Fig. 4, where for reference Fig. 4a plots
the linear output of the topological corner state. At a low
nonlinearity, a direct comparison with the linear output
shows that the corner-localized state differs in this case
from the topological corner mode, since now the energy
goes to the second (nearest neighbor) and even the fourth
sites along the edges [Fig. 4b, e]. This is because of the

nonlinearity-induced coupling between the corner and
edge modes, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. In our experiments,
because the propagation distance set by the crystal length
is typically smaller than the beating period, we cannot
observe the distinct beating oscillation between the corner
and edge modes numerically shown in Fig. 2b4. At a high
self-focusing nonlinearity, the probe beam is localized
again in the corner, forming a self-trapped semi-inﬁnite
gap corner soliton as shown in Fig. 4c65,68, also in
agreement with what is illustrated in Fig. 2b3. On the
other hand, at a high defocusing nonlinearity, the
corner excitation leads to strong spreading of the energy
into the bulk as well as into the edges (Fig. 4f) due to
nonlinear mode beating involving higher-band bulk
states. These experimental results are corroborated by
our numerical simulations based on the NLSE of Eq. (1)
(see Supplementary Material for details), clearly demon-
strating the concept of nonlinear control of the topolo-
gical BICs using a photonic HOTI platform.
Discussion
The concept of topologically protected (higher-order)
BICs, which is explored here under the action of non-
linearity, is somewhat an oxymoron. If two states are close
in energy (or, in the optics language, the propagation
constants are close), then it should be easy to couple these
states. In a nonlinear HOTI system, topology is involved
in the dynamics, and thus for the system studied here this
common sense is questioned.
In our theoretical simulations and experiments, we have
clearly found that topological higher-order BICs, which
are corner states of our nonlinear 2D SSH lattice, are

(E0 = −80 kV m−1), and the average power of the probe beam is about 15 nW (70 nW) for the low (high) nonlinearity. See Supplementary Material for

dominantly coupling to edge rather than bulk states. This
happens despite the fact that the corner-localized BICs
are embedded in the continuum of bulk states, gapped
from the edge states, as clearly illustrated in Fig. 1d1. A
weak self-focusing or self-defocusing nonlinearity, for
practically all excitations employed in this work, breaks
the chiral symmetry and the crystalline symmetry of the
lattice (the only exception is the excitation in Fig. 2, which
preserves the C4v symmetry). By breaking these symme-
tries, nonlinearity in principle allows the corner states to
couple with the bulk states of the continuum in which
they are embedded54. However, the overlap with the edge
states induced by the nonlinearity is obviously much lar-
ger, which leads to the dominant coupling between the
corner and the edge states. It should be noted that this
behavior depends (also somewhat unintuitively) on the
dimerization parameter c. If its magnitude increases (on
the highly topologically nontrivial side), the gap between
the topological corner BICs and the edge states increases
(Fig. 1c), yet the dominant corner–edge coupling persists
as opposed to the corner–bulk coupling.
A feature of interest for technological applications is the
possibility to nonlinearly couple two corners; such cou-
pling
was
proposed
with
exciton–polariton
corner
modes49. From the simulations presented in Fig. 2, it
follows that such coupling should be possible in our lat-
tice. Namely, if one excites a single corner, the initial state
is then a superposition of four corner states that will beat;
another view of the dynamics is that the nonlinearity will
enable coupling to the edge states and then to the adja-
cent corner. This type of dynamics is veriﬁed in our
numerical simulation under proper initial conditions. It
should be noted that for our experiment the longest
crystal we can possibly obtain has a length of only 20 mm,
which corresponds to only a few coupling lengths
between adjacent waveguides, a much smaller value than
the beating oscillation period (around 200 mm along the
propagation direction—see Fig. S4 in Supplementary
Material). Therefore, it is not possible to experimentally
observe the beating dynamics presented in Fig. 2 within
the length of the nonlinear crystal. However, by using
longer samples with different lengths or using different
platforms with stronger coupling, such beating oscilla-
tions should be observed.
The distinction between the discrete and the con-
tinuous models under large nonlinearities merits further
discussion. The continuous NLSE of Eq. (1) offers a
quantitatively better description of the experiment than
the discrete model in Eq. (2) under the tight-binding
approximation. However, it is well known when the two
models start to deviate. For a linear lattice that is sufﬁ-
ciently deep, the discrete model is a good approximation
of the dynamics; the parameters of the linear lattice
employed here are in this regime. When the nonlinearity
is weak, the lattice will not be strongly perturbed, and the
discrete model is still a good approximation. However, for
a large self-defocusing nonlinearity, the whole lattice
structure at the excitation can be strongly deformed. For
example, if a corner gets excited, a large self-defocusing
nonlinearity signiﬁcantly molds the corner area and
enables coupling between the NNN sites and changes the
nearest-neighbor coupling as well, which is not captured
by the discrete model of Eq. (2). In contrast, for a large
self-focusing nonlinearity, the whole lattice structure is
preserved despite the deep potential at the excitation site.
In particular, we found that the discrete model is still
qualitatively accurate for the presented self-focusing
dynamics.
Quite generally, for a weak nonlinearity and practically
any excitation, the symmetries responsible for the non-
trivial topology of the 2D SSH model are broken54.
However, in a weakly nonlinear system, the topological
properties can persist as they are inherited from the
corresponding linear system44. This is the origin of the
weak nonlinear coupling between the corner and the bulk
modes discussed above. The fact that the topological
properties are inherited is quantiﬁed and illustrated in
Fig. 4d, showing the bulk polarizations Px and Py (related
to the 2D Zak phase16,18) as a function of the parameter c
and the strength of the nonlinearity γk. The nonlinear
system corresponding to Fig. 4d is a 2D SSH lattice with
one out of four lattice sites in all unit cells excited, i.e., its
on-site refractive index is changed in comparison to the
other three sites in the unit cell. Even though this is a
speciﬁc nonlinear excitation, it serves well to quantify how
the topological feature is preserved after nonlinearity is
introduced.
It is well known that, for the linear 2D SSH lattice, the
polarizations are topologically quantized, Pi ¼ 1
2 for c < 0,
and Pi = 0 otherwise. In the nonlinear case, the symmetry
and topological protection are, strictly speaking, broken.
However, we easily see from the illustrations that there is
a sharp jump in the polarization as c crosses zero, which is
inherited from the topological phase transition occurring
in the underlying linear system. We see that the jump
indicating this phase transition is preserved in the non-
linear system as well. We expect that such inherited
nonlinear topological properties exist also in HOTIs of
the third- or even higher-order formed in synthetic
dimensions.
Finally, the ongoing debate about the use of breathing
Kagome lattices for illustrating HOTI states merits fur-
ther discussion, especially with respect to the recent work
in ref. 63. First, our current work focuses on the topolo-
gical BICs and their tunability by nonlinearity in a 2D SSH
lattice, but such states do not exist in the Kagome lattice
studied in ref. 63, which clearly distinguishes the two
independent studies51,52. Second, there is a fundamental
Hu et al. Light: Science & Applications  (2021) 10:164

difference between chiral-symmetric topological crys-
talline insulators (such as the 2D SSH structure used in
this work) that have a C4v symmetry and those that do
not have such an even-fold rotational symmetry70,71
(such as the Kagome lattices). As demonstrated recently,
even though chiral symmetry is insufﬁcient, on its own,
to stabilize corner modes against strong perturbations,
the additional presence of the fourfold rotational sym-
metry exhibited in the 2D SSH lattices does offer topo-
logical protection and further entails the formation of
the topological BICs54,55. Moreover, it has been argued
that the observed corner states in the breathing Kagome
lattices20,23,24 may not be a manifestation of the HOTI
characteristics70,71 as they simply lack for complete
symmetry protection. Hence, our work on the nonlinear
control of BIC-type corner states differs from those
based on the breathing Kagome lattices. Such compar-
ison and argument will stimulate further interest in
topological photonics - one of the burgeoning photonic
frontier areas72.
In conclusion, we have reported what we believe to be
the ﬁrst theoretical and experimental study of the non-
linear control of topological BICs in HOTIs. Under-
standing the nonlinear topological phases is not only of
fundamental interest but it may also be crucial for the
development of photonic devices based on topological
corner modes, including HOTI lasers.
Materials and methods
Experimental methods for lattice writing and probing
To demonstrate the scheme for the nonlinear control
illustrated in Fig. 1a, b, we employ a simple yet effective
CW-laser writing technique69 to establish the desired
ﬁnite-sized
photonic
2D
SSH
lattices
shown
in
Fig. 3a1–c1. The technique relies on writing the wave-
guides site by site in a 20-mm-long nonlinear photo-
refractive crystal (SBN:61 with cerium doping—0.002%
CeO2). Different from the femtosecond laser writing
method developed for glass materials5, the SSH lattices
written in the crystal can be readily reconﬁgurable in
terms of lattice spacing and boundary structures. The
experimental set-up involves a low-power (up to 100 mW)
laser beam (λ = 532 nm) to illuminate a spatial light
modulator, which creates a quasi-non-diffracting writing
beam with variable input positions. For the writing pro-
cess, we use the modulated light beam (ordinarily polar-
ized) with a self-focusing nonlinearity, but for probing
during the nonlinear control process, we employ instead
an extraordinarily polarized Gaussian beam for lattice
excitation with either a self-focusing or self-defocusing
nonlinearity, implemented conveniently by switching the
bias ﬁeld direction64,65. Because of the noninstantaneous
photorefractive “memory” effect, all waveguides remain
intact during the writing and the subsequently probing
processes. (For the speciﬁc SBN crystal we used, the
written index structure preserves for several hours in the
dark or in the presence of only weak background illumi-
nation, but it can be readily erased with high-intensity
white light and overwritten into another structure as
needed.) Through a multi-step writing approach, the SSH
lattice can be reconﬁgured from a nontrivial to a trivial
structure by controlling the lattice spacing between the
strong and weak bonds67. After the writing process is
completed, the whole lattice structure can be examined by
sending a Gaussian beam into the crystal to probe the
waveguides one by one, and then the superimposed out-
puts of the probe beam display the lattice structure as
shown in Fig. 3a1–c1. We note that the written wave-
guides are all single mode since a multi-mode waveguide
by optical induction typically requires the formation of
spatial solitons in a highly nonlinear regime73. It should
also be pointed out that, differently from the conventional
method of multi-beam induction in a biased crystal64,65,
here the lattices are written by a CW-laser beam all with a
positive bias ﬁeld69, so for both trivial and nontrivial lat-
tices, the index changes in all lattice sites follow the
intensity distribution of the same writing beam (i.e., no
“backbone lattice”64,65). After the writing process is
completed, the probe beam is used to excite the lattice,
and it can undergo either linear propagation (when the
bias is turned off) or experience a self-focusing (or self-
defocusing) nonlinearity under a positive (or negative)
bias ﬁeld. Of course, the probe beam can locally change
the index structure of the lattices due to its self-action
during nonlinear propagation—the ingredient needed for
the nonlinear control.
Numerical methods for beam propagation simulation and
polarization calculation
The evolution of a light beam propagating in a photonic
lattice is obtained by numerically solving Eq. (1) with the
split-step Fourier technique, also referred to as the beam
propagation method (BPM). The 2D SSH lattice structure
has four lattice sites per unit cell (Fig. 1b), that is,

where (a1ij, b1ij) = (iT, jT), (a2ij, b2ij) = (a + iT, jT),
(a3ij, b3ij) = (iT, a + jT), and (a4ij, b4ij) = (a + iT, a + jT),
with T = a + b being the lattice period, and a and b being
the spacing between lattice sites for the weak and strong
bonds (corresponding to intracell and intercell coupling
in Fig. 1b, respectively). The total number of unit cells is
N2/4, where w0 is a scaling factor and IL0 is the lattice
magnitude. In the experiments, depending on the relative
values between a and b, the photonic lattice can be

reconﬁgured into a simple square lattice (a = T/2), a
nontrivial SSH lattice for a > T/2 and a trivial SSH lattice
for a < T/2. Similarly, we numerically excite only one
corner (the left one in Fig. 3) with a Gaussian beam and
perform BPM simulations for subsequent dynamics under
linear and nonlinear conditions. Linear propagation
results obtained with different lattice parameters are
illustrated in Fig. 3a3–c3. For the nonlinear regime
(IP ≠0), simulations are performed for both self-focusing
and
self-defocusing
nonlinearities
in
the
nontrivial
SSH lattice, and the results obtained at low and high
nonlinearity are in good agreement with experimental
observations (see Supplementary Material).
To characterize the topological properties of the 2D
SSH lattices, we calculate the topological invariant based
on the 2D polarization, which is deﬁned for an inﬁnite
periodic system as18,19.

where i = x, y, (Ai)mn(k) = i〈um(k)|∂ki|un(k)〉is the Berry
connection, and um(k) is the eigenmode in the mth band.
The 2D polarization is directly related to the 2D Zak
phase: Zi = 2πPi. One can readily calculate the polariza-
tion in the linear regime, which yields Px = Py = 1/2 for
c < 0, and Px = Py = 0 for c > 0.
In order to test whether the signature of the topological
phase transition at c = 0 is still present in the nonlinear
regime,
we
calculate
the
nonlinear
polarization
by
employing Eq. (4) for the following modiﬁed Hamiltonian

where γk accounts for the nonlinearity strength, and its
sign manifests the difference between self-focusing and
self-defocusing nonlinearities. This Hamiltonian corre-
sponds to exciting one out of four lattice sites in all unit
cells and changing its on-site potential via the employed
nonlinearity. Calculated results for the nonlinear polar-
ization are plotted in Fig. 4d, as a function of the
dimerization parameter c = t −t′ deﬁned earlier.
