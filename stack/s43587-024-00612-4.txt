Recent investigations into heterochronic parabiosis have unveiled robust 
rejuvenating effects of young blood on aged tissues. However, the specific 
rejuvenating mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Here we 
demonstrate that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from the plasma of 
young mice counteract pre-existing aging at molecular, mitochondrial, 
cellular and physiological levels. Intravenous injection of young sEVs 
into aged mice extends their lifespan, mitigates senescent phenotypes 
and ameliorates age-associated functional declines in multiple tissues. 
Quantitative proteomic analyses identified substantial alterations in the 
proteomes of aged tissues after young sEV treatment, and these changes 
are closely associated with metabolic processes. Mechanistic investigations 
reveal that young sEVs stimulate PGC-1α expression in vitro and in vivo 
through their miRNA cargoes, thereby improving mitochondrial functions 
and mitigating mitochondrial deficits in aged tissues. Overall, this 
study demonstrates that young sEVs reverse degenerative changes and 
age-related dysfunction, at least in part, by stimulating PGC-1α expression 
and enhancing mitochondrial energy metabolism.
Aging is an inevitable, time-dependent process that eventually lim-
its the capacity of cells to maintain efficient homeostasis and repair 
mechanisms, resulting in a general decline in physiological functions 
throughout the body. The chronic diseases associated with aging, such 
as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and 
cancer, place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system1. Hence, 
understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging and developing 
strategies to combat aging and age-related diseases are greatly needed.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) revealed that the sEVs were pre-
sent in young and aged plasma at a same order of magnitude (1.7 × 109 
particles per milliliter in young plasma versus 1.04 × 109 particles per 
milliliter in aged plasma) and at a similar particle size (peaking at 
~100 nm) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) confirmed that the purified young sEVs exhibited the character-
istic morphology and size of sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Immuno-
blotting analysis showed that the purified young and aged sEVs were 
highly enriched for classical sEV markers (CD9, CD63, Alix and TSG101) 
but devoid of the major plasma protein albumin and the endoplasmic 
reticulum protein calnexin (Supplementary Fig. 1c), indicating that 
the isolated sEVs were not contaminated by plasma and intracellular 
components. To simulate the natural concentration of sEVs in plasma, 
the purified sEVs were dissolved in PBS and adjusted to a concentration 
of 1.80 μg of total protein per microliter.
Next, we determined whether the purified sEVs derived from 
young mouse plasma possess the capability to extend the lifespan of 
aged mice. An equal volume (200 μl) of PBS or young sEVs (1.80 μg of 
total protein per microliter) was intravenously injected into aged male 
mice (20 months) once a week until death. Survival analysis showed 
that weekly injection of young sEVs significantly extended the median 
lifespan of aged mice by 12.42% (34.4 months for young sEV-injected 
mice versus 30.6 months for PBS-injected mice) (Fig. 1a). Moreover, 
young-sEV-treated aged mice generally maintained a much healthier 
appearance than the age-matched control mice treated with PBS. 
Specifically, although young mice exhibited black and glossy hair on 
the dorsal back skin and aged mice displayed gray hair and patches of 
hair loss, injection of young sEVs substantially prevented hair loss in 
aged mice (Fig. 1b).
Frailty is an aging-related syndrome characterized by decline 
in many physiological systems, leading to loss of homeostasis and 
vulnerability to adverse health outcomes12. Previous studies estab-
lished a non-invasive frailty index to quantify the frailty status of aged 
mice through clinical assessment of deficit accumulation13. With the 
use of this objective metric, we determined the frailty index scores 
in young-sEV-treated aged mice and calculated their biological age 
(an estimated age based on the extent of physiological degeneration) 
independent of their chronological age (defined by birth date). As 
anticipated, the average frailty index score was much higher in aged 
mice than in young mice (Fig. 1c). However, treatment with young 
sEVs markedly reduced the frailty index in aged mice (Fig. 1c), result-
ing in an estimate of biological age of approximately 15.1 months for 
these aged mice compared to their chronological age of 24 months. 
Particularly, although all clinical signs of deficits were alleviated in 
young-sEV-treated aged mice, the most obviously reduced deficits 
were observed in integument and the physical/musculoskeletal system 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Long-term effects of young sEVs on whole-body physiology
To assess the long-term rejuvenating effects of young sEVs on distinct 
tissues and organs, aged male mice were intravenously injected with 
Mechanistically, the aging process is predominantly attributed 
to the progressive accumulation of stochastic damages in cells, 
organelles and macromolecules. The exact mechanisms underlying 
the damage are not yet fully understood but likely consist of several 
cell-autonomous processes, including genomic instability, telomere 
attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutri-
ent sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence and stem 
cell exhaustion2. However, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, espe-
cially the altered interactions among cells, tissues and organs, are also 
critically important for aging3. The efficient interaction between tissues 
and organs, facilitated by environmental factors present in the blood-
stream, is vital for maintaining the health status of the whole body. 
Thus, age-related deterioration is also thought to arise from impaired 
tissue communication, with molecules circulating in the bloodstream 
serving as principal contributors4. Recent studies demonstrated that 
blood from young mice in heterochronic parabiosis—a surgical proce-
dure that joins the circulation systems of two animals of different ages 
together—rejuvenated brain, heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, skeletal 
muscle and bone of aged mice5. Several studies further showed that 
plasma infusion recapitulates the phenotypes conferred by blood 
exchange in heterochronic parabiosis models, which decouples the 
effects of cellular contributions from transferred plasma factors6,7. 
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to identifying the soluble 
factors in plasma responsible for reversing age-related impairments. To 
date, several rejuvenation factors (also referred to as blood-borne fac-
tors, pro-youth factors or anti-aging factors) present in young plasma 
have been described8–10. However, the precise mechanisms underlying 
the action of these soluble plasma factors are not fully understood.
In the past decade, extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated intercellular 
communication has added a new dimension to our knowledge of genetic 
information transfer and homeostasis maintenance in multicellular 
organisms. EVs, a heterogeneous group of nanosized membranous 
vesicles, are composed of a protein-rich lipid bilayer and the enclosed 
proteins and RNAs derived from EV-producing cells11. EVs circulate 
throughout the body via blood circulation and act as messengers of 
intercellular communication networks, allowing exchange of their car-
goes between source cells and target cells11. Because the blood contains 
numerous bioactive EVs and EVs exert pleiotropic effects on whole-body 
physiology and homeostasis, blood-borne EVs may mediate the aging 
process through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism and may explain 
the rejuvenating effects of young blood. In this study, we focused on 
small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, <200 nm) and explored their rejuve-
nating effects by repeated administration of sEVs derived from young 
mice or humans to aged mice. We further elucidated the molecular 
basis underlying the critical roles of young sEVs in reversing age-related 
impairments and degenerative changes using in vivo and in vitro models.
Results
Long-term effects of young sEVs on lifespan and frailty
We first established a standard protocol for purifying sEVs from 
the plasma of young (2 months) and aged (20 months) male mice.

monitored to determine either the survival time or whole-body physiology.

Because advanced male age negatively impacts fertility and is closely 
related to low sperm count, reduced sperm motility and high DNA 
fragmentation14, we first evaluated the rejuvenating effects of young

plasma and testis (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c), indicating the presence of 
age-related testosterone secretion insufficiency. However, treatment 
with young sEVs significantly increased circulating and intratesticular 
testosterone concentrations in aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). 
Both total sperm counts and the percentage of sperms displaying 
forward progressive movement were substantially reduced in aged 
mice compared to young mice, but young sEV injection significantly 
improved sperm counts and enhanced sperm motility in aged mice 
(Fig. 1d,e). When the susceptibility of sperm DNA to denaturation was 
evaluated using a sperm chromatin structure assay, there was a notable 
increase in sperm DNA fragmentation observed in aged mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2d,e). However, treatment with young sEVs significantly 
improved the integrity of sperm chromatin and reduced the proportion 
of sperm DNA fragmentation in aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). To 
evaluate the fertility of young-sEV-treated aged mice, sexually mature 
female mice of proven fertility were mated with aged or young male 
mice for 12 h, and then the embryo implantation was examined using 
vascular blue dye injection at 4.5 days post-coitus (dpc) to visualize 
implantation sites in the uterus. Young males resulted in an average of 
7.7 ± 0.3 implantation sites per pregnant female, whereas aged males 
failed to establish visible implantation sites in the uterus (Fig. 1f,g). 
Young sEV injection substantially alleviated the male fertility defects 
in aged mice, improving the success rate of embryo implantation to 
3.4 ± 1.4 sites per pregnant female (Fig. 1f,g). In addition, we conducted 
a continuous mating experiment using proven fertile females paired 
with aged or young males to determine the reproductive outcomes of 
young-sEV-treated aged mice. After a 1-month mating period, young 
males produced an average of 8.4 ± 1 pups per litter, whereas aged 
males produced an average of 4.4 ± 1 pups per litter (Fig. 1h). After the 
injection of young sEVs, aged males produced nearly equal numbers 
of pups (7.8 ± 1 pups per litter) as young males (Fig. 1h).
Second, we employed an indirect calorimetry system to assess 
the metabolic health of mice. Consistent with previous reports that 
energy expenditure and locomotor activity decline with the aging 
process15, aged mice had a lower oxygen consumption (VO2) and car-
bon dioxide production (VCO2) and exhibited decreased locomotor 
activity and heat production in both dark and light cycles (Fig. 1i). 
Young-sEV-treated aged mice exhibited consistently higher VO2 and 
VCO2 and displayed elevated locomotor activity and heat produc-
tion than age-matched control mice treated with PBS (Fig. 1i). These 
results suggest that the injection of young sEVs into aged mice partially 
restored their metabolic health to the level of young mice.
Third, we examined the cardiac performance of mice using echo-
cardiography, as progressive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and 
systolic/diastolic dysfunction are hallmarks of cardiac aging16. In echo-
cardiography, cardiac aging is usually reflected by an increased LV mass, 
a reduction in the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) 
and an increase in LV volumes at end-diastolic and end-systolic phases 
(LV Vol;d and LV Vol;s, respectively)17. As anticipated, aged mice exhib-
ited significant decreases in EF and FS and increases in LV mass, LV Vol;d 
and LV Vol;s compared to young mice (Fig. 1j–l and Supplementary 
Fig. 2f–h), indicating the prevalence of LV hypertrophy and impaired 
ventricular filling and myocardial contractility in aged mice. However, 
after the injection of young sEVs, an apparent improvement in the 
echocardiography parameters was observed in aged mice (Fig. 1j–l 
and Supplementary Fig. 2f–h).
Fourth, we evaluated whether young sEVs could protect aged 
mice from accelerated bone loss. On microcomputed tomography 
(micro-CT), age-related bone loss and architecture deterioration are 
usually manifested as a decrease in the number of trabeculae of cancel-
lous bone, an increase in intertrabecular distance and a loss of trabecu-
lar connectivity18. Accordingly, micro-CT images showed that aged mice 
had a porous trabecular bone structure at the proximal femur, whereas 
young mice had a well-structured and dense trabecular bone (Fig. 1m). 
Quantitative analyses revealed that the bone volume per tissue volume 
(BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) 
were lower and the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was higher in aged 
mice than in young mice (Fig. 1n,o and Supplementary Fig. 2i,j). Treat-
ment with young sEVs substantially repaired the bone architecture in 
aged mice, bringing the trabecular bone parameters to a similar level 
as observed in young mice (Fig. 1m–o and Supplementary Fig. 2i,j).
Finally, we employed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to moni-
tor the volumetric alterations in the hippocampal and cortical brain 
areas in aged mice. The hippocampus and cerebral cortex play key roles 
in learning, memory and executive functions, and these brain regions 
are particularly vulnerable to aging at the morphological level, which is 
characterized by progressive hippocampal and cortical atrophy result-
ing from neuronal shrinkage and loss19. Both the absolute hippocampal 
volume and the ratio of hippocampal volume to whole-brain volume 
were reduced in aged mice compared to young mice, whereas the young 
sEV injection significantly attenuated hippocampal loss in aged mice 
(Fig. 1p,q and Supplementary Fig. 2k–n). Similarly, apparent cortical 
atrophy was observed in aged mice, but young sEV injection mitigated 
the degree of atrophy and alleviated the decrease in cortical volume 
(Fig. 1p,r and Supplementary Fig. 2k–m,o). Taken together, the above 
results suggest that young sEVs have the capacity to revitalize the mor-
phology and performance of aged tissues and organs to a younger state.
Short-term effects of young sEVs on cognition and endurance
Because the effects of aging on the brain and skeletal muscle are par-
ticularly deleterious, leading to cognitive dysfunction and sarcope-
nia20,21, we employed a series of behavioral paradigms to investigate 
whether young sEV injection can rapidly improve cognitive perfor-
mance and endurance capacity in aged mice. In the Morris water maze 
test to assess hippocampus-dependent learning and memory function, 
aged mice reached the hidden platform with longer latency, spent less 
time in the target quadrant and had a decreased frequency of plat-
form crossings than young mice (Fig. 2a–c). The injection of young 
sEVs significantly improved the ability of aged mice to find the hid-
den platform and increased their time spent in the target quadrant, 
Fig. 2 | Short-term effects of young sEV injection on memory ability, 
endurance performance and senescent phenotypes of aged mice. Aged male 
mice (21 months) were intravenously injected with 200 μl of PBS or young sEVs 
(1.80 μg of total protein per microliter, from 2-month-old male mice) seven 
times over 2 weeks, and then the two groups of aged mice were either assessed 
by a series of behavioral paradigms to determine memory ability and endurance 
performance or assessed by multiple senescence biomarkers to determine 
senescent phenotypes. Young male mice (2 months) were simultaneously 
injected with PBS to serve as a control group. a, The escape latency of each group

of freezing during the contextual memory task (Fig. 2d). After the injec-
tion of young sEVs, aged mice displayed significantly enhanced con-
textual fear memory (Fig. 2d), suggesting that young sEVs mitigate 
hippocampus-related memory deficits in aged mice. In an incremental 
treadmill test to assess endurance performance, young mice ran up to 
32.34 ± 0.73 min until exhaustion, whereas aged mice achieved a shorter 
running time of 19.77 ± 2.76 min (Fig. 2e). Injection of young sEVs signifi-
cantly prolonged the total treadmill running time to 29.19 ± 0.27 min 
for aged mice (a 47.6% increase in running time) (Fig. 2e). As the basal 
physiological values and behavioral activity of aged mice may vary 
greatly, we compared the behavioral changes of the same batch of 
aged mice before and after the seven injections of PBS or young sEVs 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). No changes in behavioral performance were 
observed in the aged mice before and after the injection of PBS (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3b–f). However, compared to their performance before 
sEV treatment, aged mice exhibited enhanced spatial memory of the 
hidden platform location in the Morris water maze test, had improved 
associative memory in the contextual fear conditioning test and were 
more resistant to exhaustion during treadmill running after injection 
of young sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 3b–f). Furthermore, we performed 
a head-to-head comparison of the effects of young sEVs versus aged 
sEVs on behavioral phenotypes in aged mice. Aged male mice were 
intravenously injected with equal amounts of young or aged sEVs seven 
times over 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 4a). PBS-treated aged mice and 
aged sEV-treated aged mice exhibited similar patterns in behavioral 
tests, whereas PBS-treated young mice and young-sEV-treated aged 
mice performed consistently better in these behavioral paradigms 
(Supplementary Fig. 4b–f). This result rules out the possibility that the 
sEV administration itself, regardless of the age of the donor mouse, can 
induce physiological responses and affect aging process. Overall, these 
behavioral paradigms indicate that young sEVs rapidly ameliorate the 
pre-existing functional decline in aged mice.
Given that young sEVs have demonstrated the capability to rejuve-
nate aged tissues at both physiological and behavioral levels, it raises 
the question of whether aged sEVs might exert completely opposite 
effects, potentially accelerating the aging process. To elucidate this, 
we reversed the protocol and intravenously injected young mice with 
200 μl of PBS or aged sEVs seven times over 2 weeks (Supplementary 
Fig. 4g). Compared to PBS-treated young mice, aged sEV-treated young 
mice exhibited a higher escape latency and had less swimming time 
in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze test (Supplementary 
Fig. 4h–j). Likewise, aged sEV-treated young mice displayed impaired 
associative memory in the contextual fear conditioning test and were 
more susceptible to exhaustion in the treadmill running test (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4k,l). These behavioral results suggest that aged sEVs 
induce a rapid decline in memory function and endurance capacity 
in young mice.
Previous studies showed that young blood reverses age-related 
impairments in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in aged 
mice22. Particularly, systemic administration of young blood plasma 
(100 µl per intravenous injection, from 3-month-old male mice) into 
aged male mice (18 months) eight times over 3 weeks rejuvenates 
cognitive function in both contextual fear conditioning and radial 
arm water maze paradigms22. To test whether young sEVs mediate the 
rejuvenating effects of young plasma, we intravenously injected aged 
mice with 200 μl of PBS or young plasma seven times over 2 weeks 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). Injection with young plasma alleviated the 
characteristic behavioral traits of aging to a similar extent as injection 
with young sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 5b–f). On the other hand, simi-
lar results to those using aged sEVs were observed in the experiment 
injecting aged plasma into young mice (Supplementary Fig. 5g–l). 
Thus, young/aged sEVs recapitulate most of the behavioral pheno-
types conferred by young/aged plasma, indicating that the beneficial/
detrimental effects of young/aged plasma observed in heterochronic 
parabiosis models and plasma infusion are mediated, at least in part, 
by their sEV component.
Effects of young sEVs on senescent phenotypes
One of the most well-characterized contributors to aging is senescent 
cells2. We determined the alteration of senescence-associated pheno-
types in aged mice after young sEV injection. Senescent cells usually 
switch on the expression of acidic β-galactosidase, which is known as 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and the presence 
of this active enzyme indicates the senescent state of cells23. Although 
the percentage of SA-β-gal-stained cells in the heart and muscle of aged 
mice is quite low, aged mice indeed exhibited an apparent increase in 
SA-β-gal activity in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, hippocampus and 
testis compared to young mice (Fig. 2f). However, young sEV treatment, 
even when administered for a short time of 2 weeks, rapidly reduced the 
level of SA-β-gal staining in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, hippocampus 
and testis (Fig. 2f). Another well-established marker of cellular senes-
cence is high expression of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p16, which ren-
ders the senescence growth arrest irreversible24. As expected, aged mice 
displayed increased p21 and p16 expression levels in various tissues 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). However, short-term treatment with young 
sEVs significantly attenuated p21 and p16 expression in these tissues 
(Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Furthermore, because senescent 
cells are known to be non-proliferative25, Ki67, an endogenous marker of 
cell proliferation, was specifically examined in the hippocampus region 
of young-sEV-treated aged mice. Compared to young mice, the percent-
age of Ki67-positive cells was significantly lower in the hippocampus 
of aged mice (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 6d). However, young sEV 
treatment rapidly alleviated this senescent phenotype in aged mice, 
as reflected by the emergence of more Ki67-positive proliferating cells 
in aged hippocampus (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 6d). Because 
senescent cells are also characterized by excess production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) due to the dysfunctional mitochondria26, we 
quantified ROS levels in young-sEV-treated aged mice. Intracellular 
ROS levels were substantially increased in a variety of tissues of aged 
mice, but young sEV treatment restored this marker to the normal 
levels detected in young mice (Fig. 2i). In addition, some additional 
morphological and molecular features of aging, including accumu-
lation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and aggregation 
of lipofuscin, were evaluated in young-sEV-treated aged mice. AGEs, 
formed by a non-enzymatic reaction between the ketone or aldehyde 
groups of sugars and the amino groups of proteins, are accumulated

a, Flow chart of the experimental design. Aged male mice (21 months) were 
intravenously injected with 200 μl of PBS or young sEVs (from 2-month-old 
male mice) seven times over 2 weeks, and then the two groups of aged mice were 
euthanized to extract total protein from eight tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, 
kidney, hippocampus, muscle and testis). Approximately 100 μg of protein 
isolated from each tissue was used for iTRAQ experiments. b, The numbers

as a sign of aging or degenerative disorder27. Although AGE content 
was significantly increased in various tissues of aged mice, young sEV 
treatment rapidly eliminated the accumulation of excessive AGEs in 
aged mice (Fig. 2j). Lipofuscin is a pigment that accumulates with age in 
the lysosomal compartment of post-mitotic cells28. Although the liver,

staining for lipofuscin, manifested as dark brown–black granules in 
the sections, aged mice that received a short-term injection of young 
sEVs clearly exhibited fewer perinuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates 
of lipofuscin in these tissues (Fig. 2k).
On the other hand, long-term injection of young sEVs was also 
efficient in rejuvenating the aged tissues and inhibiting cellular senes-
cence. As shown by SA-β-gal staining, young-sEV-treated aged mice 
exhibited a substantial reduction in SA-β-gal activity in various tissues, 
especially in the spleen, kidney, hippocampus and testis, where very 
few SA-β-gal-positive cells were observed (Supplementary Fig. 7a). 
Consistently, long-term treatment with young sEVs resulted in a marked 
reduction in p21 and p16 expression in each aged tissue tested (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7b,c).
Young sEVs alter the proteomes of multiple aged tissues
To reveal the mechanism of young sEV treatment at the proteome level, 
we collected eight tissues from PBS-injected and young sEV-injected 
aged mice and performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quan-
tification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analyses for individual 
tissues (Fig. 3a). A total of 14,474 proteins were identified, and 10,319 
proteins were quantified (Fig. 3b). A heatmap was generated with the 
R package clusterProfiler to obtain an overview of the proteome-level 
changes induced by young sEVs (Fig. 3c). Although the expression 
levels of most proteins showed no clear separation between groups 
treated with PBS and young sEVs, some proteins showed substantial 
upregulation or downregulation after treatment. Accordingly, uniform 
manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) annotation of the 
iTRAQ quantitative proteomic data showed a clear separation between 
the spleen, hippocampus and lung samples from PBS-injected and 
young-sEV-injected aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Subsequently, we employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
software to conduct Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, aiming to 
further elucidate the effects of young-sEV-induced proteome changes 
on biological processes. After GSEA, leading-edge analysis was applied 
to identify the enriched terms or gene sets considered of high biological 
interest in all eight tissues. Then, the 2,046 GO terms exported from 
leading-edge analysis were clustered with the ‘binary cut’ algorithm 
using the R package simplifyEnrichment. Five GO term clusters were 
enriched, and the word cloud nicely highlighted the common biological 
functions involved in each cluster (Fig. 3d). (1) Cluster 1 was more specifi-
cally enriched in ‘signal transduction and signaling pathway’ (typical 
terms: regulation of intracellular signal transduction, regulation of 
apoptotic signaling pathway and androgen receptor signaling pathway). 
(2) Cluster 2 was strongly linked to ‘metabolic process’ (typical terms: 
mitochondrial RNA metabolic process, cellular respiration, NADH oxi-
dation and lipid biosynthetic process) and ‘protein/DNA modification’ 
(typical terms: DNA methylation, DNA demethylation, protein hydroxy-
lation and protein deglycosylation). (3) Cluster 3 was tightly linked to 
‘tissue development, morphogenesis and differentiation’ (typical terms: 
muscle tissue development, platelet morphogenesis and leukocyte 
differentiation). (4) Cluster 4 was specifically related to ‘organization 
and assembly’, including ‘chromosome organization and modification’ 
(typical terms: chromosome organization, chromatin assembly or 
disassembly, chromatin remodeling, histone ubiquitination, histone 
H3 deacetylation and regulation of histone methylation) and ‘orga-
nelle assembly and disassembly’ (typical terms: nuclear membrane 
organization, organelle disassembly, protein–lipid complex assembly, 
mitophagy, proteasome assembly and mitotic spindle assembly). (5) 
Cluster 5 was tightly linked to ‘transport, localization and secretion’ 
(typical terms: growth hormone secretion, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, 
protein localization to Golgi apparatus and regulation of intracellular 
lipid transport). Among these five clusters, deregulation of the GO 
terms in clusters 2 and 4 was closely related to three typical features 
of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic alterations 
and genomic instability. Furthermore, the clustered GO terms closely 
related to the hallmark of aging in clusters 2 and 4 were integrated and 
visualized as a heatmap (Fig. 3e), which revealed that young sEV treat-
ment resulted in similar trends for alterations in multiple GO terms 
among different tissues. Overall, these results reflect that young sEVs 
may reverse age-related degenerative changes through multiple mecha-
nisms and exert rejuvenating effects in a comprehensive manner.
Young sEVs counteract mitochondrial deficiency in vivo
Mitochondria are ubiquitous intracellular organelles whose primary 
role is to supply cells with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)29. Despite 
their central role in cell metabolism, mitochondria are the most fre-
quently damaged organelles during aging, which deteriorate with 
age, lose respiratory activity to produce ATP and accumulate dam-
age to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), eventually leading to metabolic 
abnormalities and functional decline in various tissues30. Because the 
GO term cluster of ‘metabolic process’ was identified as a cardinal fea-
ture associated with proteome alterations in young-sEV-treated aged 
mice, we examined the alterations in mitochondrial functions and 
metabolic phenotypes in these mice. Compared to young mice, aged 
mice exhibited a significantly lower ATP synthesis rate and respira-
tory complex V activity in the hippocampus and muscle (Fig. 4a–d). 
Young sEV treatment led to a significant increase in ATP production 
and complex V activity in the hippocampus and muscle of aged mice 
(Fig. 4a–d). In addition, mtDNA copy number, a classical biomarker that 
reflects the abundance of mitochondria within a cell31, was assessed. 
Aged mice displayed reduced mtDNA copy number in the hippocampus 
and muscle compared to young mice (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary 
Fig. 9a,b). In contrast, treatment with young sEVs reversed the reduc-
tion in mtDNA copy number in the hippocampus and muscle of aged 
mice (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). Besides hippocampus and 
muscle, an apparent decline in mtDNA content was also observed in the 
heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and testis of aged mice, and young sEVs 
could also mitigate the loss of mtDNA content in these tissues after a 
short-term injection (Supplementary Fig. 9c–h). Conversely, aged sEVs 
did not induce any alteration of cellular ATP production, respiratory 
complex V activity and mtDNA content in hippocampus and muscle of 
aged mice, whereas young sEVs did (Supplementary Fig. 10a–f), which 
further confirmed the beneficial effects of young, but not aged, sEVs 
on mitochondrial energy metabolism.
During aging, damaged mitochondria with absent or disorganized 
cristae accumulate within cells32. To evaluate the effects of young sEVs 
on mitochondrial mass and morphology, we visualized the mitochon-
dria at the ultrastructural level by TEM. The hippocampus and muscle of 
aged mice had fewer mitochondria than those of young mice, whereas 
more mitochondria were observed in the hippocampus and muscle of 
aged mice treated with young sEVs (Fig. 4g–j). Particularly, whereas 
the ultrastructure of the mitochondria present in the hippocampus 
and muscle of aged mice was very unhealthy, as manifested by many 
swollen or broken mitochondria, the percentage of abnormal mito-
chondria decreased significantly after young sEV treatment (Fig. 4g,h). 
Moreover, mitochondrial density and morphology were determined in 
the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of young-sEV-treated aged mice 
by TEM. The proportion of mitochondria was significantly increased 
and the rate of swollen mitochondria and broken mitochondrial matrix 
was decreased in these tissues of aged mice after treatment with young 
sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition, we performed immunofluo-
rescence staining with antibodies against succinate dehydrogenase 
complex subunit A (SDHA, a major catalytic subunit of complex II 
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which served as a sensitive 
marker for mitochondria) and Desmin (a myogenic marker) to visualize 
mitochondrial distribution in muscle fibers33. Whereas the intensity of 
SDHA staining was significantly reduced in the muscle of aged mice, 
young-sEV-treated aged mice showed a significant increase in SDHA 
staining intensity in the muscle (Fig. 4k,l), indicating a recovery of 
mitochondrial content after treatment. Overall, these results suggest

that young sEVs may increase mitochondrial mass and maintain mito-
chondrial function to increase ATP supply, thereby compensating for 
mitochondrial deficiency in aged tissues.
Conversely, when aged plasma sEVs were injected into young 
mice, they caused a significant reduction of cellular ATP production, 
respiratory complex V activity and mtDNA content in hippocampus 
and muscle of young mice (Supplementary Fig. 10g–l). In TEM images, 
both a decrease in mitochondria density and damaged mitochondrial 
structure were observed in hippocampus and muscle of young mice 
after treatment with aged sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 10m–p). These 
results indicate that aged sEVs can accelerate mitochondrial deficit 
and energy deficiency in vivo.
Young sEVs enhance respiratory capacity in vitro
To assess the rejuvenating effects of young sEVs on cellular energy 
metabolism, we established an ex vivo model by isolating sEVs from 
the plasma of young mice and incubating them with a neuroepithelial 
NE-4C cell line or a myogenic C2C12 cell line (Supplementary Fig. 12a). 
Young sEV treatment accelerated the ATP synthesis rate, increased 
the enzymatic activity of complex V and increased the mtDNA copy 
number in NE-4C and C2C12 cells (Supplementary Fig. 12b–g). Addi-
tionally, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of oxida-
tive phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration34, was 
examined. Young-sEV-treated cells exhibited a significant increase in 
the basal OCR, ATP-coupled OCR and maximal OCR (Supplementary 
Fig. 12h–k), reflecting an enhanced OXPHOS capacity and electron 
transport activity. In addition, young sEVs inhibited cell senescence 
and rejuvenated cell proliferation in both cell lines, as manifested by 
reduced p21 expression and increased 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) 
incorporation (Supplementary Fig. 12l–q).
To ensure that young sEVs can rescue the dysfunction of aged mito-
chondria, H2O2 was used to induce cell senescence in NE-4C and C2C12 
cells (Fig. 5a). Induction of cell senescence by H2O2 markedly reduced 
ATP synthesis rate, complex V activity and mtDNA copy number in 
NE-4C and C2C12 cells (Fig. 5b–g). Exposure to H2O2 also caused severe 
respiratory chain deficiency in cells, as indicated by the disruption 
of mitochondrial respiration during OCR measurements (Fig. 5h–k). 
However, treatment with young sEVs resulted in increased ATP produc-
tion and mtDNA content in H2O2-induced cells (Fig. 5b–g). Likewise, 
treatment with young sEVs protected against H2O2-induced mitochon-
drial respiratory dysfunction in cells, as evidenced by the improved 
mitochondrial respiration tested by OCR measurements (Fig. 5h–k). 
In addition, whereas H2O2 enhanced p21 expression and reduced EdU 
incorporation in NE-4C and C2C12 cells, treatment with young sEVs 
suppressed cell senescence and rejuvenated cell proliferation ability in 
H2O2-induced cells (Fig. 5l–q). Overall, these results indicate that young 
sEVs can affect the key regulatory nodes of mitochondrial biogenesis 
and function to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in senescent cells.
Young human sEVs ameliorate age-related impairments in 
mice
Because the biological activity of sEVs exhibits little to no species speci-
ficity35,36, we investigated whether young human sEVs could ameliorate 
age-related impairments in mice. To this end, we purified human sEVs 
from the plasma of young male donors and intravenously injected 
them into aged mice at the same dose and frequency as mouse sEVs 
(Supplementary Fig. 13a). Behavioral tests revealed that young human 
sEVs efficiently ameliorated cognitive deficits and improved endurance 
capacity in aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 13b–f). Young human sEVs 
also significantly accelerated ATP production, stimulated complex V 
activity and increased the mtDNA content in the hippocampus and 
muscle of aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 13g–i). In particular, the loss 
of mitochondrial mass and structural integrity in aged hippocampal 
and muscle cells was substantially rescued by young human sEVs, as 
shown in TEM images of the ultrastructure of mitochondria (Supple-
mentary Fig. 13j–m). Likewise, mitochondrial activity in muscles, as 
determined using succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, was mark-
edly recovered by young human sEVs (Supplementary Fig. 13n,o). 
Moreover, young human sEVs increased ATP production, complex 
V activity and mitochondrial content (Supplementary Fig. 14a–g); 
enhanced basal, ATP-coupled and maximal respiration during OCR 
measurements (Supplementary Fig. 14h–k); and caused a decrease in 
p21 levels and an increase in cell proliferation in NE-4C and C2C12 cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 14l–q). Overall, these results reveal that young 
human sEVs can rescue the dysfunction of aged mouse tissues and 
ameliorate age-related deficiencies in mitochondria in a similar man-
ner to that of young mouse sEVs.
Specific microRNAs are altered in plasma sEVs along with age
Given the above-observed phenotypes, it remains unclear which com-
ponent is responsible for the rejuvenating effects of young plasma 
sEVs. The inherent structure of sEVs enables the efficient transfer of 
informative molecules between cells, including proteins, lipids, DNAs 
and RNAs37. To date, a large number of studies have been directed at 
understanding the RNA components of sEVs, especially microRNAs 
(miRNAs)38. Indeed, the miRNA cargoes encapsulated within sEVs can 
be transferred to recipient cells, leading to important functional effects 
on target genes and cellular pathways, thereby regulating a previously 
unacknowledged mechanism of intercellular communication39. We 
hypothesized that some miRNAs in plasma sEVs may be the rejuvena-
tion factor of young blood. To prove this, we first examined the miRNA 
profiles in aged and young mouse plasma by small RNA deep sequenc-
ing. According to the criteria of mean reads > 50, |fold change| > 2 
and P < 0.05, 75 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed 
(32 higher and 43 lower) in aged plasma compared to young plasma 
(Supplementary Table 2). Hierarchical clustering analysis clearly sepa-
rated the aged plasma samples from young plasma samples based on 
plasma miRNA profiles (Fig. 6a). Second, we conducted a comprehen-
sive review of the current literature on age-related circulating miR-
NAs (in plasma and serum) and summarized their changing patterns 
throughout the aging process. A total of 90 miRNAs were identified 
as the signature characterizing the aging process, among which 53 
were increased and 37 were decreased along with age (Supplemen-
tary Table 3). Third, we compared the result of small RNA sequencing 
with that of literature mining. Specifically, 15 miRNAs (seven higher 
and eight lower in aged plasma versus young plasma) were shared

circulating miRNAs, we measured the nine miRNAs in the plasma sEVs 
from aged and young mice and humans. According to the criteria of 
|fold change| > 2 and P < 0.05, the contents of miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p 
and miR-34a-5p were significantly higher in the plasma sEVs from aged 
mice and humans, whereas miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p 
contents were significantly higher in the plasma sEVs from young mice 
and humans (Fig. 6e,f). Thus, miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p 
were considered as the representative cargoes of sEVs at the young 
state, whereas miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p were charac-
teristic of sEVs at the aged state.
Furthermore, we examined whether the miRNA cargoes of young 
sEVs can be taken up by aged tissues after young sEV injection. We 
labeled young sEVs with PKH26, a red fluorescent dye specifically 
designed to label the lipid bilayers of sEVs, and then intravenously 
injected PKH26-labeled sEVs into aged mice and tracked the distri-
bution of young sEVs in vivo. Whereas the free PKH26 dye injection 
did not result in fluorescence accumulation in the tissue sections of 
aged mice, red fluorescence was clearly observed in the hippocam-
pus and muscle of aged mice after young sEV injection (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 15), indicating the potential transfer of young sEVs from the 
bloodstream to tissues such as the hippocampus and muscle. Nota-
bly, aged sEVs injected into aged mice should have been labeled to 
assess the presence of donor aged sEVs across various tissues, mir-
roring the approach used for donor young sEVs. This additional step 
would have facilitated an investigation into whether aging affects the 
tropism of circulating sEVs, revealing a limitation left unaddressed  
in this study.
Next, we examined the uptake of sEV miRNAs by aged tissues. After 
the injection of young mouse sEVs into aged mice, both the mature and 
precursor forms of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p were meas-
ured in recipient mice. Mature miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p 
were significantly upregulated in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, 
hippocampus, muscle and testis of aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 16a). 
However, no alteration in pre-miR-144, pre-miR-149 and pre-miR-455 
levels was observed in these tissues (Supplementary Fig. 16b), sug-
gesting that the endogenous levels of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and 
miR-455-3p were not induced by the injected young sEVs. Therefore, 
the elevation of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p in aged tis-
sues is likely due to sEV-mediated delivery of exogenous miR-144-3p, 
miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p to these tissues.

miRNAs in young sEVs induce PGC-1α in vitro and in vivo
Next, we predicted the target genes that may be regulated by the miR-
NAs in young and aged plasma sEVs. By literature mining, we iden-
tified the key targets shared by the representative miRNAs in aged 
and young plasma sEVs. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 17a, peroxi-
some proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator α (PGC-1α), 
a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function40, is a

miR-34a-5p41–43. In contrast, because the downstream target genes 
of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p, including β-amyloid pre-
cursor protein (APP), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2) and

correlation with PGC‐1α44–47, miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p 
can be considered as indirect stimulators of PGC‐1α expression (Sup-
plementary Fig. 17a). The putative binding sites are illustrated in Sup-
plementary Fig. 17b. Both the sequences of miRNAs and the sequences 
of miRNA binding sites are highly conserved across species (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17b,c).
As a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis, PGC-1α enhances 
mitochondrial biogenesis by coordinating the expression of mitochon-
drial proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, 
and it maintains the stability of the number and quality of mitochondria 
by regulating mitochondrial quality control and promoting mitochon-
drial regeneration48. The essential role of PGC-1α in mitochondrial 
biogenesis and OXPHOS motivates the hypothesis that the miRNA 
cargoes enriched in young plasma sEVs may exert a beneficial effect 
on mitochondrial energy metabolism by positively regulating PGC-1α, 
whereas the miRNAs enriched in aged plasma sEVs may exacerbate 
impaired mitochondrial biogenesis by negatively regulating PGC-1α. 
Consistent with this, PGC-1α expression was experimentally validated 
to be inhibited by miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p mimics in 
NE-4C and C2C12 cells (Fig. 7a). In addition, miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p 
and miR-455-3p mimics directly suppressed APP, PARP-2 and HIF1an 
(Fig. 7b), which, in turn, led to increased PGC-1α expression in cells 
(Fig. 7a).
Subsequently, we investigated whether PGC-1α is associated with 
the rejuvenating effects of young sEVs in vitro and in vivo. Consistent 
with previous findings that PGC-1α is usually expressed at a high level 
in tissues with a great demand for ATP generation and decreases with 
age48, PGC-1α was indeed particularly vulnerable to aging compared 
to other metabolic genes and exhibited a significant reduction in the 
hippocampus and muscle of aged mice compared to young mice (Sup-
plementary Fig. 18a). The injection of young sEVs derived from young 
mice into aged mice increased PGC-1α expression in the hippocampus 
and muscle (Fig. 7c,d), and young mouse sEVs also increased PGC-1α 
expression in NE-4C and C2C12 cells (Fig. 7e). Conversely, injection 
of aged sEVs into aged mice did not change PGC-1α expression in the 
hippocampus and muscle (Supplementary Fig. 18b). On the other 
hand, the stimulatory effect of young sEVs on PGC-1α expression in 
the hippocampus and muscle of aged mice and in NE-4C and C2C12 
cells was validated by using the young sEVs derived from young human 
donors (Supplementary Fig. 18c–e). To determine whether the reju-
venating activities of young sEVs are exerted through their action on 
PGC-1α expression, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PGC-1α 
was transfected into NE-4C and C2C12 cells along with young sEVs. 
The siRNA-mediated PGC-1α silencing substantially diminished the 
beneficial effects of young sEVs on mitochondrial respiration (Sup-
plementary Fig. 19). The findings indicate that the rejuvenating effects 
of young sEVs are at least partially mediated by modulation of PGC-1α 
expression.
To assess whether the miRNA cargo is indispensable to the reju-
venating activity of young sEVs, we pretreated young sEVs with Triton 
X-100 (to permeabilize the membranes of sEVs) and RNase, and then we 
incubated NE-4C and C2C12 cells with the resultant young sEVs. Previ-
ous studies showed that the membrane structure of sEVs is capable 
of protecting their RNA cargoes from degradation by RNase; hence, 
co-treatment with Triton X-100 and RNase rapidly degraded miRNA 
contents in sEVs49. Consistent with this, whereas intact young sEVs 
improved mitochondrial respiration in NE-4C and C2C12 cells, a sig-
nificant reduction in mitochondrial OCR was detected in cells treated 
with the young sEVs derived from pre-incubation with Triton X-100 
and RNase (Supplementary Fig. 20).
Finally, we investigated whether the miRNA cargoes in young 
sEVs could improve mitochondrial metabolism by reinforcing PGC-1α 
expression. Induction of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p in 
NE-4C and C2C12 cells by transfection with corresponding mimics 
led to increased respiratory rate, ATP production and mitochondrial 
mass (Fig. 7f–h). To specifically block the function of the internalized 
miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p, a combination of antisense 
oligonucleotides of miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p was trans-
fected into NE-4C and C2C12 cells along with young plasma sEVs, and 
the cells were assessed for metabolic and senescent phenotypes in 
comparison with the cells treated solely with young sEVs (Fig. 8a). 
Whereas young sEVs exhibited considerable rejuvenating activity in 
stimulating PGC-1α expression, enhancing mitochondrial respiration 
and increasing ATP synthesis and mitochondrial content in NE-4C and 
C2C12 cells, antisense oligonucleotides completely reversed the effects 
of young sEVs on promoting PGC-1α expression and mitochondrial

prevented cell senescence and activated cell proliferation, as reflected 
by reduced p21 expression and increased EdU incorporation in cells, 
antisense oligonucleotides largely blocked these beneficial effects of 
young sEVs (Fig. 8j–m). Thus, miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p 
encapsulated in young plasma sEVs are the key rejuvenating miRNAs

and have the potential to stimulate PGC-1α expression and improve 
mitochondrial energetic metabolism.
Conversely, we investigated whether the miRNA cargoes in aged 
sEVs could facilitate PGC-1α loss and drive age-related mitochondrial 
impairments. As expected, aged sEVs exhibited considerable inhibitory 
activity against PGC-1α expression in the hippocampus and muscle of 
young mice (Supplementary Fig. 18f). Likewise, direct transfection with 
miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p mimics led to reduced PGC-1α 
expression in NE-4C and C2C12 cells (Fig. 7a), which was accompanied 
by loss of mitochondrial activity and mtDNA content in these cells 
(Fig. 7f–h). We then co-administrated antisense oligonucleotides of 
miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p and aged sEVs to NE-4C and 
C2C12 cells. Aged sEVs strongly inhibited PGC-1α expression, caused 
impaired mitochondrial activity and reduced mtDNA content and 
promoted cellular senescence marker p21 in NE-4C and C2C12 cells; 
however, co-treatment with antisense oligonucleotides significantly 
rescued the detrimental effects of aged sEVs on mitochondrial bio-
genesis and metabolism, recovering PGC-1α expression, mitochon-
drial function and p21 level to a normal state (Supplementary Fig. 21), 
further proving that the pro-aging effects of aged sEVs are carried out, 
at least in part, through their miRNA cargoes. Therefore, miR-29a-3p, 
miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p in aged plasma sEVs are the key pro-aging 
miRNAs with an entirely opposite function to miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p 
and miR-455-3p encapsulated in young plasma sEVs.
Discussion
Until very recently, aging was found to arise, in part, as a consequence 
of the alteration of EVs in peripheral blood. Indeed, blood-borne EVs 
are naturally positioned in multiple pathways affecting cell-to-cell 
signaling, and aberrant levels of EVs may alter intercellular communi-
cation and contribute to the characteristic features of aging50. Unlike 
soluble plasma factors, blood-borne EVs carry a payload of informa-
tion that exerts a comprehensive and profound influence on systemic 
communication. In fact, previous studies provided substantial circum-
stantial evidence supporting the critical functions of EVs in aging. For 
example, EVs and their cargoes have been advocated as biomarkers 
for capturing the complexity of aging51. Additionally, induction of cel-
lular senescence alters EV secretion and EV miRNA cargo in vivo52, and 
senescent cells release their EVs to the local tissue microenvironment 
or body fluids to exert an adverse effect on tissue homeostasis during 
aging53. Recently, direct in vivo evidence has emerged to provide pre-
liminary insights into the contribution of EVs to aging. The most direct 
evidence is that EVs isolated from young mouse plasma have a clear 
pro-longevity role in aged mice. In detail, EV-mediated systemic delivery 
of extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) 
mitigates age-associated functional decline in specific tissues, delays 
the age-associated mortality rate and extends healthspan and lifespan 
in mice54. In the present study, we discovered a dominant rejuvenating 
effect of young sEVs on aged tissues. Several administrations of young 
sEVs led to a remarkable enhancement in the physical performance 
and physiological functions of aged mice, although aged blood was 
continuously produced to dilute, neutralize and remove the beneficial 
effects of young sEVs. Moreover, although the whole body improved 
rapidly within a few days after short-term injection of young sEVs, 
long-term injection of young sEVs even revitalized some properties 
and performance of aged tissues (hippocampus, muscle, heart, testis 
and bone) to an equivalent extent as in young mice. Consequently, 
young-sEV-treated aged mice exhibited a healthier appearance; a lower 
frailty index; enhanced cognitive ability, endurance performance and 
cardiac function; improved sperm quality and male fertility; increased 
energy expenditure; and decelerated bone loss at the physiological 
level. These results indicate that the rejuvenating effects of young EVs 
are pronounced and lasting.
The groundbreaking discoveries regarding the rejuvenating 
effects of young blood have inspired the concept of directly transfusing 
young blood to older adults suffering from age-related diseases. 
Recently, researchers have commenced the process of translating 
these findings from the laboratory to clinical practice. One pilot clin-
ical study showed that a young plasma infusion into patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease was safe and produced some promising results, 
although no statistically significant improvements in cognition were 
detected55. Although blood products have been successfully used in 
clinical settings to treat various diseases over an extended period, their 
application in addressing age-related conditions presents distinct chal-
lenges and necessitates careful consideration before translation. These 
concerns relate to the potential risks and side effects inherent in blood 
infusion, particularly with respect to allergic reactions, hemolysis and 
transmission of infectious diseases. In addition, the limitations associ-
ated with identifying suitable young human donors for a potentially 
substantial population of aged patients cannot be underestimated. 
Hence, it is crucial to identify the precise rejuvenating factors inherent 
in young blood to simplify conventional blood products and develop 
a more effective component that can specifically target aging-related 
phenotypes. To this end, our findings suggest a possibility that uses 
sEVs as a medication for an effective anti-aging intervention. Indeed, 
sEVs have some innate advantages over other components of blood. 
First, as endogenous nanovesicles secreted from living cells, sEVs 
are biocompatible and non-cytotoxic and have low immunogenicity 
when administered in vivo. sEVs are also easy to store, have a long 
lifespan, possess high cargo loading capacity and can even access the 
central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier. Second, 
sEVs offer a more refined alternative to whole blood. Their reduced 
complexity makes them safer and more accessible compared to the 
supply of whole blood. The side effects and potential risks associated 
with blood infusion may be considerably mitigated by the use of sEVs. 
Third, the volume of blood infusion is limited; however, because sEVs 
can be concentrated during purification, their rejuvenating effect can 
be amplified. However, despite the promising and encouraging results, 
there is a long journey ahead from experimental studies to the clinical 
application of young sEVs. Notably, the validation of the efficacy and 
safety of sEV injections in clinical trials is essential to establish them as 
a viable prophylactic or therapeutic approach for age-related diseases.
The discovery of the bioactivity of blood-borne sEVs is inspiring 
but raises the question of molecular mechanisms. Due to the pivotal 
role of sEVs in the transport of their cargoes, the search for active 
molecules within sEVs provides an opportunity to comprehensively 
delineate the effects of sEVs on the aging process. In the present 
study, we reported the activity of specific miRNAs in sEVs that par-
tially recapitulate the revitalizing activity of young blood. In detail, 
miR-144-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-455-3p recapitulated the effect of 
young sEVs, reinforced PGC-1α expression and counteracted mito-
chondrial deficits, whereas miR-29a-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-34a-5p 
attenuated PGC-1α expression and facilitated mitochondrial deficits. 
Thus, sEV miRNAs possibly play a dual role as a double-edged sword 
in the aging process: stimulating the cells and tissues to become more 
energetic in a young state while driving metabolic insufficiency to 
exacerbate functional decline in an aged state. The beneficial or det-
rimental aspects of sEV miRNAs will depend on their proportion in the 
blood circulation. The progressive accumulation of pro-aging miRNAs 
and loss of rejuvenating miRNAs during the aging process, which are 
manifested as increased vulnerability to mitochondrial deficits and 
increased accumulation of senescent cells, will eventually disrupt 
tissue homeostasis and aggravate energy deficits for physiological 
activity. However, sEVs are important for transferring not only miR-
NAs but also other cargoes, as the composition of sEV cargo is highly 
complex, consisting of hundreds to thousands of diverse proteins, 
lipids, DNAs and RNAs56. Although our study largely focused on the 
miRNA component of sEVs, we do not expect that miRNA is the sole 
active component in sEVs. Indeed, miRNA is only a class of small RNAs 
enriched in sEVs; small RNAs account for only a portion of total RNAs

in sEVs; and RNA is only one type of component of sEVs. sEV miRNAs 
are unlikely to operate as an all-around factor in young blood; instead, 
more sEV components (other regulatory RNAs, mRNAs, DNAs, lipids, 
cytosolic proteins and membrane-bound proteins) likely function in a 
cooperative manner to regulate the aging process. Consistent with this, 
some previous studies focused on proteins enriched in young EVs and 
showed that the EV-enclosed eNAMPT and glutathione-S-transferase 
mu 2 (GSTM2) protein rejuvenated the regenerative capacity of aged 
tissues and declined with advanced age54,57. Likewise, it has been found 
that the impact of young EVs on muscle progenitor cell bioenergetics 
and myogenicity and skeletal muscle regeneration is dependent on 
the presence of abundant transcript levels of the pro-longevity protein 
α-Klotho in young, but not old, EVs58. Future studies should investigate 
the relative contributions of different components of blood-borne 
sEVs to the aging process, thereby providing a strong rationale for  
the therapeutic use of sEVs to treat age-related diseases. Neverthe-
less, the identification of miRNA profiles in sEVs derived from young 
and aged plasma represents an initial milestone in comprehending 
the molecular mechanisms underlying sEV-mediated aging. From 
the perspective of translation, elucidating the molecular mechanism 
governing the functional switch of miRNAs within sEVs and maintain-
ing a stable pool of rejuvenating miRNAs in circulation may offer a 
therapeutic strategy for modulating the aging process and mitigating 
its impact on overall health and well-being.
Aging is associated with a reduction in ATP production through 
OXPHOS, primarily due to impaired mitochondrial function. In the pre-
sent study, we provided compelling evidence that young plasma sEVs 
were internalized by aged tissues and cells, which increased PGC-1α 
expression, facilitated mitochondrial metabolism and preserved the 
high level of energy support for aged tissues. Induction of PGC-1α 
expression and activity by young sEVs is, therefore, expected to become 
a therapeutic strategy for circumventing age-related mitochondrial 
dysfunction. However, although this study largely focused on PGC-1α 
and mitochondrial metabolism, we do not expect that PGC-1α is the 
sole downstream target of the rejuvenating miRNAs in young sEVs. The 
involvement of other miRNA–target pairs must contribute to the repair 
of aged tissues and aging-related pathologies. For example, aging is 
also associated with a decline in autophagic capacity and an increase 
in oxidative stress59. By in-depth analysis of the proteomic data using 
the GO term GOBP_AGING (including GOBP_CELL AGING) in GSEA, 
several proteins related to autophagy dysfunction and antioxidant 
responses were found to be substantially altered in the hippocampus 
and muscle of young-sEV-treated aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 22). 
Future studies are needed to examine whether these altered proteins 
are downstream targets of the miRNAs in young sEVs.
Taken together, our findings reveal that young plasma sEVs coun-
teract pre-existing aging at the molecular, mitochondrial, cellular and 
physiological levels. Because young sEVs are promising natural vehicles 
that stably transport rejuvenation factors without causing toxicity 
or immunogenicity, they provide a unique opportunity to serve as a 
versatile tool for rejuvenating aging tissues and improving lifelong 
health and well-being.
Methods
Animal model
Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Model Animal 
Research Center of Nanjing University. Male mice were exclusively used 
for all experiments conducted in this study. These mice were housed in  
a controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle (illuminated 
from 7:00) and granted unrestricted access to both food and water. All 
experiments were approved by the Animal Ethical and Welfare Com-
mittee of Nanjing University. The approved animal ethical and welfare 
number is IACUC-2010001. All animal care and handling procedures 
were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guide-
lines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Plasma and sEV isolation
Human blood was extracted from each donor by aseptic venipuncture 
and collected into a vacuum tube (~5 ml) containing EDTA as an anti-
coagulant. Mouse blood was collected by intracardiac puncture into 
an Eppendorf tube (~1.5 ml) containing trisodium citrate as an antico-
agulant. Plasma was obtained by centrifuging whole blood at room 
temperature for 15 min at 1,600g. The purified plasma samples were 
immediately centrifuged to obtain the purified sEVs or stored at −80 °C.
Plasma sEVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. In brief, the 
plasma was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and subjected to 
a series of centrifugation steps at different speeds and durations. 
Specifically, centrifugation was performed at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, 
followed by 3,000g for 25 min at 4 °C, 12,000g for 60 min at 4 °C and, 
finally, 120,000g for 70 min at 4 °C (polycarbonate tubes, 355630, 
Beckman Coulter; MLA-55 rotor, Optima MAX-XP, Beckman Coulter). 
The sEV pellet was collected, and the remaining supernatant was fur-
ther processed using the Total Exosome Isolation Kit (from plasma) 
(Invitrogen, 4484450) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
In brief, 0.2 volumes of Exosome Precipitation Reagent were added to 
the supernatant, which was then incubated at room temperature for 
10 min. Subsequently, sEVs and the supernatant were separated via 
centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C, with the resulting sEV 
pellets being collected and resuspended in PBS.
The yield of sEVs was assessed by quantifying the total pro-
tein content using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Approximately 1,000 μg of total protein content of 
sEVs could be obtained from 1 ml of plasma. Because the recovery 
yield of sEVs from viscous body fluids (plasma and serum) using 
ultracentrifugation-based procedures has been estimated to range 
from 5% to 25%60, the genuine sEV content in plasma might be several 
folds higher than the measured value (1.00 μg of total protein per 
microliter). To simulate the natural concentration of sEVs in plasma, 
the volume of PBS solution used to dissolve sEVs was approximately 
0.56 times the original volume of plasma, so the final concentration of 
sEVs in PBS was generally 1.80 μg of total protein per microliter. The 
sEV samples were promptly stored at 4 °C for short-term storage and 
at −20 °C for long-term storage.
The size and concentration of sEVs were analyzed using a 
NanoSight LM10 system, as previously described61. The morphol-
ogy and size of sEVs were also examined using a Hitachi TEM system 
(Hitachi, HT7700), as previously described61. To analyze the purity 
and protein contents of sEVs, the sEVs supplemented with RIPA lysis 
buffer were subjected to western blotting for the classical sEV markers 
(CD63, ~50 kD; TSG101, ~47 kD; Alix, ~100 kD; and CD9, ~25 kD), along 
with the major plasma protein albumin (~70 kD) and the endoplasmic 
reticulum protein calnexin (~55 kD). To analyze the RNA contents of 
sEVs, total RNA was isolated from sEVs using TRIzol reagent, and the 
levels of sEV miRNA were quantified.
Injection of sEVs
In long-term experiments, young sEVs were isolated from the plasma 
of 2-month-old male mice using ultracentrifugation and subsequently 
diluted in PBS to achieve a concentration of 1.80 μg of total protein per 
microliter. Aged male mice (20 months) were intravenously injected 
with 200 μl of PBS or young sEVs once a week. At different timepoints, 
changes of physiological activities and functions, including sperm qual-
ity and male fertility (22-month-old mice receiving eight injections); 
metabolic rate and energy expenditure (23-month-old mice receiving 12 
injections); cardiac functions (23.5-month-old mice receiving 14 injec-
tions); bone microarchitecture (24-month-old mice receiving 16 injec-
tions); and brain volume alterations (24.5-month-old mice receiving  
18 injections), were evaluated. As a control, a group of young male 
mice (2 months) receiving only PBS was simultaneously monitored.
In short-term experiments, sEVs were isolated from the plasma 
of 2-month-old or 20-month-old male mice using ultracentrifugation.

These sEVs were then diluted in PBS to achieve a concentration of 
1.80 μg of total protein per microliter. Aged male mice (21 months) 
were intravenously injected with 200 μl of PBS or young sEVs seven 
times over 2 weeks, and young male mice (2 months) were intravenously 
injected with 200 μl of PBS or aged sEVs seven times over 2 weeks. PBS 
was injected at the same volume (200 μl) and frequency (seven times 
over 2 weeks) as a control. Moreover, sEVs were purified from the plasma 
of young male donors (19–24 years) and intravenously injected into aged 
mice (21 months) at the same dose (1.80 μg of total protein per micro-
liter, 200 μl) and frequency (seven times over 2 weeks) as mouse sEVs. 
Subsequently, these mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests to 
evaluate memory and endurance performance, or they were evaluated 
using multiple senescence biomarkers to assess senescent phenotypes.
Lifespan
The aging mouse cohorts were accommodated in the animal core facil-
ity at Nanjing University and granted unrestricted access to a standard 
laboratory diet and water. Mice allocated for the survival study were 
exclusively designated for this purpose and were not subjected to any 
other biochemical, physiological or metabolic analyses. Aged mice 
received intravenous injections of an equal volume (200 μl) of either 
PBS or young sEVs once a week. These mice were carefully monitored 
daily until their natural death.
Fertility assessment
Aged males injected with PBS or young sEVs were mated with 
4-month-old female mice. Female mice were proven to be fertile after 
a minimum of one litter. To conduct a continuous mating study, male 
and female pairs were co-housed for a 30-d period. Each morning, the 
females were examined for the presence of copulation plugs, preg-
nancy and litter size. The presence of a vaginal plug was considered 
indicative of successful mating within the pairs. The number of off-
spring per litter was documented using a camera (Canon). To visual-
ize implantation sites in the uterus, males and females were paired 
overnight. The presence of a vaginal plug the next morning signified 
successful mating, and the midpoint of that day was designated as 
0.5 dpc. The embryo implantation was examined at 4.5 dpc in pregnant 
mice. Approximately 5 min after intravenously injecting 200 µl of 1% 
Evans Blue per mouse, the mice were euthanized, and pictures of the 
incised uterus were taken. The blue bands were recorded and counted 
as the implantation site.
Quantification of testosterone levels by ELISA
Testosterone levels were quantified using ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, mouse 
plasma samples were collected in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes containing 
trisodium citrate dihydrate, and tissue samples were homogenized in 
PBS (protease inhibitors were added to PBS) on ice. Then, the samples 
were competed with a fixed amount of target on the solid phase sup-
porter, where the target sites were biotinylated detection antibodies 
specific to the target. Subsequently, the HRP-conjugated strepta-
vidin–biotin complex (SABC) was added to each well of the micro-
plate and incubated. The enzyme–substrate reaction was initiated by  
the addition of TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate solu-
tion, and the resulting color change was measured at a wavelength of 
450 nm after terminating the reaction with a sulfuric acid solution.
Sperm motility
The caudal region of the epididymis from each mouse was placed in a 
centrifuge tube containing Hank’s medium. Subsequently, the caudal 
region was transferred to a fresh dish with Hank’s medium and punc-
tured at multiple points along the longitudinal axis using a surgical 
dissection blade to release sperm into the medium. The dish was then 
incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to allow sperm dispersion. Sperm motility 
parameters were evaluated using a computer-assisted sperm analysis 
(CASA) system equipped with Sperm Vision HR software version 1.01 
(Minitube, Ingersoll). Each sample was subjected to the analysis of 
200 spermatozoa.
Sperm DNA integrity
Sperm DNA fragmentation was assessed using the Sperm Nucleus 
DNA Integrity Kit (Huakang Biomed) following the manufacturer’s 
guidelines. In brief, mouse semen samples were extracted from the 
epididymis and mixed with fluidized agarose in a tube. Approximately 
30 μl of this mixture was deposited onto a pretreated slide and imme-
diately covered with a coverslip. After a 4-min incubation at 4 °C, the 
coverslip was removed, and the slide underwent acid denaturation for 
7 min, followed by 20 min of lysis. Subsequently, the slide was rinsed 
for 3 min with distilled water and sequentially dehydrated in 70%, 
90% and 100% ethanol baths for 2 min each. After Wright’s staining, 
spermatozoa were counted to assess sperm DNA fragmentation using 
a bright-field microscope (Nikon).
Indirect calorimetry analyses
Continuous monitoring of O2 consumption, CO2 production, heat 
production and physical activity was conducted using a combined 
indirect calorimetry system (TSE phenoMaster, TSE Systems GmbH), 
as previously described15. The system was maintained at a constant 
environmental temperature of 22.0 ± 1.0 °C and followed a 12-h light/
dark cycle (with lights off between 18:00 and 6:00). Individual housing 
in metabolic cages was provided for the mice, allowing unrestricted 
access to food and water.
Young and aged mice were acclimated to the metabolic cages for 
48 h before data collection. All data were recorded during the next 
48-h period in metabolic cages. Energy expenditure was determined by 
measuring heat production (kcal h−1 kg−1), O2 consumption (ml h−1 kg−1) 
and CO2 production (ml h−1 kg−1). Physical activity of each mouse was 
recorded over 48 h (counts per 48 h) using a multidimensional infrared 
light beam system. Bar graphs were generated based on the results 
obtained using the indirect calorimetry system, which mean light and 
dark phase results and all-time results.
Echocardiography
Cardiac function was evaluated using transthoracic echocardiogra-
phy employing a Visual Sonics Vevo 3100 instrument equipped with a 
30-mHz linear transducer probe (Fujifilm), as previously described62. 
Young and aged mice were induced with 2.5% isoflurane delivered in 
1 L min−1 of compressed air, and anesthesia was sustained through an 
operative circuit nose GeroScience cone (Harvard Apparatus). Body 
temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 °C using a heating 
platform. Respiratory and heart rates were continuously monitored 
through a four-lead limb electrocardiogram, with isoflurane adjusted in 
1 L min−1 compressed air to maintain a heart rate higher than 350 beats 
per minute (bpm). The mouse’s chest was shaved, and a layer of acoustic 
coupling gel was applied to the thorax. Subsequently, two-dimensional 
parasternal short-axis (SA) M-mode views of the left ventricle were 
acquired following optimization of gain settings, slight angulation and 
transducer rotation to enable imaging of both epicardial and endocar-
dial surfaces. Particular care was taken during the procedure to prevent 
excessive thoracic pressure that could induce bradycardia. Cine loop 
analysis of cardiac cycles between respirations was conducted using 
VevoLab software to mitigate respiratory artifacts. Measurements of 
LV Vol;d, LV Vol;s, EF, FS and LV mass were obtained from a minimum of 
four cardiac cycles. Two observers, who were blinded to each other’s 
results, conducted all echocardiographic measurements.
Micro-CT scanning
In vivo micro-CT analysis was conducted to evaluate the microstruc-
ture of the proximal tibia and vertebrae in both young and aged mice. 
Anesthesia was induced using 2.5% isoflurane delivered in 1 L min−1 

Nature Aging
Article

compressed air and maintained through an operative circuit nose cone 
provided by GeroScience. Respiratory and heart rates were continuously 
monitored using a four-lead limb electrocardiogram. Micro-CT images 
were acquired using a Hiscan XM Micro CT analyzer (Suzhou Hiscan 
Information Technology), following previously established protocols63. 
All scans were performed with an 80-kV tube voltage and a 100-A tube 
current, capturing images at a 25-µm resolution. A 0.5° rotation step was 
employed over a 360° angular range, with a 50-ms exposure per step. 
Image reconstruction was carried out using Hiscan Reconstruct software 
(version 3.0, Suzhou Hiscan Information Technology), and subsequent 
analysis of the original three-dimensional (3D) images of the proximal 
tibia and vertebrae was performed using Hiscan Analyzer software (ver-
sion 3.0, Suzhou Hiscan Information Technology). From the CT scans, 
parameters including tTb.Th, Tb.Sp, Tb.N and BV/TV were calculated 
for each mouse. Two independent observers, who were blinded to each 
other’s results, conducted all measurements on the micro-CT images.
MRI scanning
Anesthesia was induced in both young and aged mice using 2% isoflu-
rane and maintained at 1% throughout the MRI experiments. An oxygen 
generator with a flow rate of 2 L min−1, consisting of 90% oxygen and 10% 
isoflurane, was used and remained unchanged throughout the experi-
ment. The mice were positioned in a horizontal bore 9.4T BioSpec 94/20 
USR animal scanner (Bruker, Billerica). The body temperature and 
respiration rate of young and aged mice were continuously maintained 
using a warming pad and monitored using an MRI-compatible monitor-
ing system. After scanning, young and aged mice were again transferred 
to the recovery room. T2WI and DTI protocols were used to ensure that 
images covered the volume between the olfactory bulb and the anterior 
part of cerebellum (field of view: 2.6 cm × 2.6 cm; thickness: 0.3 mm; 
0.0703 × 0.0703 × 0.6 mm voxels; and 30 slices with no interslice gaps). 
Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually traced for the whole brain, 
hippocampus and cortex using the professional 3D medical image 
segment software ITK-SNAP 3.8.0 package (University of Pennsylvania) 
and based on previously reported methods64,65. The segmentation and 
volume calculations of MRI images were performed independently by 
two observers who remained blinded to each other’s results.
SA-β-gal staining
SA-β-gal staining was conducted using a commercial β-galactosidase 
staining detection kit (Solarbio)66. Cryosections were fixed with the 
supplied fixative solution for 15 min at room temperature. After fixa-
tion, the sections were immersed in a fresh β-gal staining solution in 
buffer and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Microscopic images of the 
stained sections were captured using a microscope (Nikon). The inten-
sity of SA-β-gal staining in these images was quantified using ImageJ 
software (National Institutes of Health).
Immunohistochemistry of Ki67
Immunohistochemistry staining for Ki67 in the hippocampal sections 
was performed following the established protocol67. Hematoxylin stain-
ing was used to visualize cellular nuclei, which manifest as a blue hue, 
and the detection of Ki-67-positive staining relied upon the presence 
of discernible brown staining.
Quantification of AGE and ROS levels by ELISA
Quantification of AGE27 and ROS26 levels was performed using ELISA kits 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were homog-
enized in cold PBS, and the total protein concentrations were determined 
using the BCA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The levels of AGEs were 
quantified using a commercially available ELISA kit (mouse AGE ELISA 
kit, FineTest Biotech) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. 
This process involved the use of a multifunctional microplate reader 
(SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices). The content of ROS was measured 
using the same method and kit (mouse ROS ELISA kit, FineTest Biotech).
Lipofuscin staining (aldehyde fuchsine method)
Lipofuscin staining was conducted using a commercially available 
lipofuscin staining detection kit (Solarbio) in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions68. The liver, kidney, heart and hippocam-
pus were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h. After dehydration 
and cryosectioning, tissue sections were stained in aldehyde fuchsine 
dyeing solution overnight at 37 °C. After this incubation, microscopic 
images of the sections were acquired using a microscope (Nikon).
Morris water maze test
The Morris water maze test was conducted in accordance with estab-
lished protocols to evaluate spatial memory performance69. In brief, 
a circular water pool measuring 1.2 m in diameter and 50 cm in height 
was filled with water at a constant temperature of 24 °C. To facilitate 
accurate identification of the C57BL/6J mice, white food-grade stain 
was added to the pool. An imperceptible fixed platform, measuring 
10 cm in diameter, was situated 1 cm below the water’s surface. The mice 
were trained to navigate and locate the concealed platform within the 
water pool. To achieve this, the mice were exercised to form a ‘spatial 
orientation map’ in the brain using different figure shapes and colors 
as visual stimuli from extra-maze cues along the sidewall of the swim-
ming pool to accomplish this task.
During the spatial training phase (days 1–5), mice were given a 
60-s time limit to locate the hidden platforms. The trial concluded 
automatically once a mouse successfully located the platform, climbed 
onto it within 60 s and remained on the platform for at least 5 s. Each 
day, the mice underwent four trials starting from different directions, 
with intervals of more than 20 min between trials. In case a mouse 
failed to find the platform within the allocated 60 s on the first day 
of training, gentle guidance was provided to lead it to the platform. 
The time taken by the mice to locate and ascend to the platform was 
documented as the escape latency, using a video camera for accuracy. 
After the spatial training phase, a probe trial was conducted on day 6 
to evaluate memory consolidation. During this trial, the platform was 
removed from the pool, allowing the mice to swim freely for 60 s. The 
time spent by each mouse in the target quadrant, where the platform 
was originally positioned, as well as the number of times the mice 
crossed the location where the platform had been, were recorded by 
video and subsequently quantified.
During the acquisition training phase, aged mice consistently 
displayed prolonged escape latency and traversed longer paths in 
their quest to locate the concealed platform70. In contrast, young mice 
exhibited shorter escape latencies and covered shorter distances in 
comparison70. In the subsequent probe trial, young mice demonstrated 
a higher propensity to spend time in the target quadrant and made 
more frequent crossings over the original platform location, whereas 
their aged counterparts spent notably less time in the target quadrant 
and primarily navigated the tank without crossing over the platform’s 
initial position70. These observations collectively suggest compro-
mised spatial learning and memory performance in the aged mice.
In this test, the variables were strictly controlled to ensure rigor 
and reproducibility of behavioral tests. The water temperature was 
kept constant, and appropriate lighting was provided. The experi-
mental environment (for example, humidity, temperature, smell and 
sound) was kept constant in all behavioral sessions. The animals were 
consistently handled and tested by the same investigators through-
out the entire duration of the Morris water maze tests. Moreover, 
the investigators conducting the behavioral experiments remained 
blinded to the group assignments. All experiments were conducted 
between 10:00 and 17:00.
Contextual fear conditioning test
The contextual fear conditioning test was conducted following estab-
lished protocols71. In this test, mice were trained to associate the fear 
conditioning chamber with an aversive stimulus (mild foot shock; 

Nature Aging
Article
https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00612-4
unconditioned stimulus (US)) for the assessment of contextual fear 
conditioning. Additionally, they were conditioned to associate tone 
cues (conditioned stimulus (CS)) with mild foot shocks to evaluate cued 
fear conditioning. The mice’s conditioned fear behavior was assessed 
by measuring freezing behavior.
On the training day (day 1), mice were placed in a fear condition-
ing chamber and allowed to acclimate to the environment for 2 min. 
After this, they received a 30-s tone (70 dB, 2 kHz) paired with a 2-s foot 
shock (0.6 mA). The CS–US pairing was repeated twice with a 2-min 
intermission. On the testing day (day 2), mice were placed in the same 
fear conditioning chamber for 3 min without any tone or foot shock to 
assess contextual memory. Freezing time was recorded and analyzed 
for this purpose. After a 2-h period, the mice were transferred to a new 
chamber with different odor, floor texture, chamber wall texture and 
chamber shape. They were given 2 min to acclimate, followed by a 
30-s tone (70 dB, 2 kHz), and the freezing behavior was recorded and 
analyzed for 2 min to assess cued memory. The intensity of the foot 
shock was set at a level that was not painful but generated an unpleas-
ant feeling for the mice. Freezing behavior was quantified and analyzed 
using a video tracking system and software (Taimeng).
Young and aged mice typically displayed similar levels of baseline 
freezing behavior during the training phase. However, during contex-
tual memory testing, aged mice consistently exhibited lower levels of 
freezing compared to young mice72. These observations suggest the 
presence of non-spatial deficits in learning and memory in aged mice.
Exhaustive running test
A treadmill running test was used to measure the endurance exercise 
capacity and was performed as described previously69. In brief, acclima-
tization to the treadmill was carried out over a period of 2 d before the 
experimental phase. This involved a 10-min run at 10 m min−1, followed 
by a 2-min run at 20 m min−1.
On the day of the exhaustive exercise, the mice were subjected 
to a progressive running protocol on a fixed 10° slope. This protocol 
consisted of running at 10 m min−1 for 15 min, followed by 13 m min−1 
for 3 min, 16 m min−1 for 3 min, 19 m min−1 for 3 min and 22 m min−1 
for 3 min, after which they ran at 25 m min−1 until exhaustion. Forced 
running was induced by positioning an electric grid with a voltage of 
35 V at the end of the treadmill. Exhaustion was defined as the mice 
remaining on the shock grid for a continuous period of 5 s. The time to 
exhaustion was recorded. All animals were exercised at the same time 
to minimize diurnal effects. The animals were consistently handled and 
tested by the same investigators throughout the entire duration of the 
exhaustive running tests. Moreover, the investigators conducting the 
behavioral experiments remained blinded to the group assignments. 
All experiments were conducted between 10:00 and 17:00.
sEV labeling and tracking
sEVs were labeled using PKH26 fluorescence kits following the manu-
facturer’s guidelines. In brief, sEVs suspended in PBS were mixed with 
PKH26 dye. After ultracentrifugation at 120,000g for 70 min, the super-
natant containing the unbound dye was discarded, and the pellet was 
resuspended in PBS. Labeled sEVs were then intravenously injected into 
wild-type C57BL/6J mice. On day 2 after administration, the mice were 
anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline to 
eliminate any remaining blood-derived sEVs in tissues. Hippocampus 
and muscle were excised, and frozen sections were analyzed using fluo-
rescence confocal microscopy to visualize the red fluorescent signals.
Protein reduction, alkylation, digestion and iTRAQ labeling
Protein extraction, protein concentration measurement and iTRAQ 
labeling were performed as previously described73. In brief, 100 µg of 
protein isolated from eight different organs/tissues (including heart, 
liver, spleen, lung, kidney, hippocampus, muscle and testis) was used 
for iTRAQ experiments. After TCEP (AB SCIEX) reduction, MMTS (AB 
SCIEX) alkylation and trypsin (Promega) digestion, the resulting pep-
tides from each organ/tissue were collected and subjected to iTRAQ 
labeling using an iTRAQ Reagent 8-Plex Multiplex Kit (AB SCIEX). In one 
individual iTRAQ experiment, four biological replicate samples from 
PBS-injected aged C57BL/6J male mice were labeled with iTRAQ tags 
113, 114, 115 and 116, and four samples from young-sEV-injected aged 
mice were labeled with iTRAQ tags 117, 118, 119 and 121. For each iTRAQ 
experiment, all labeled peptides were finally separated into 16 samples, 
desalted and concentrated for liquid chromatography with tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis, as previously described73.
LC–MS/MS and database searching
MS data were acquired using a TripleTOF 5600+ System (AB SCIEX), as pre-
viously described73. The original MS/MS data were submitted to Protein-
Pilot version 4.5 (AB SCIEX) for database searching by searching against 
Mus musculus sequences in the UniProt database concatenated with the 
reverse decoy database (4 March 2021, containing 55,366 sequences; 
http://www.UniProt.org/proteomes/UP000000589). The searching 
parameters were set as described in a previous study73. The MS proteom-
ics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium74 via 
the PRIDE75 partner repository with project accession code PXD030350.
Bioinformatics analysis
Intensive bioinformatics analyses were conducted with R, RStudio, 
GSEA and other requisite packages and online tools.
To get an overview of quantitative proteomics data from all eight 
groups, both the identified proteins and the quantified proteins were 
counted for each group, and UMAP analysis was performed using the R 
package ‘umap’. Moreover, a whole-proteome heatmap was also gener-
ated by the R package clusterProfiler76 to determine the homogeneity 
in four samples injected with PBS in all eight organs/tissues and four 
samples injected with young sEVs in the same iTRAQ experiment as a 
quality control of biological replicates.
For in-depth functional class scoring, GSEA (http://www.
gsea-msigdb.org) was performed using the R package clusterProfiler76 
and GSEA software77. The significantly upregulated or downregulated 
GO terms between four samples injected with PBS and four samples 
injected with young sEVs in all eight tissues or organs were retained 
for further analysis. The GO terms of GSEA were clustered with the 
‘binary cut’ algorithm using the R package simplifyEnrichment to 
further analyze the GSEA results. In the process of ‘binary cut’ cluster-
ing, difference score, cluster numbers and other parameters were 
set following the R package documentation78. Heatmaps with word 
cloud annotations were generated to summarize the functions of each 
enriched GO cluster.
Protein extraction and western blots
For cellular protein isolation, cells were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) and 
subsequently lysed in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with PMSF (1:100, 
Beyotime Biotechnology) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (1:100, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 30 min. For tissue protein isolation, 
samples mixed with RIPA, PMSF and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 
were homogenized using a grinder at 60 Hz for 60 s, followed by lysis at 
4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, cell lysates and tissue homogenates were 
centrifuged at 12,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant 
was collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the 
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Samples containing equivalent amounts of protein (40–80 μg) 
were loaded and separated on 10–12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and subse-
quently transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). These membranes 
were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in 
TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After blocking, the membranes were 
incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibodies. 
After three washes with 1× TBST for 10 min each, secondary antibodies 
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an additional 

Nature Aging
Article

three 10-min washes with 1× TBST. The membranes were treated with 
ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions, and protein levels were visualized using the Tanon 5200 
multi-detection system (Tanon). Data were quantified using ImageJ 
software, and the relative protein levels were normalized to the β-actin 
level. Additional information on primary antibodies is available in 
Supplementary Table 4.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT–PCR assay
Total RNA was extracted from cell and tissue samples using TRIzol 
reagent (Invitrogen) following previously described methods69.
For mRNA expression analysis, cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg 
of total RNA using the AMV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) and oligo 
dT primers (TaKaRa). The reverse transcription reaction was carried 
out at 16 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 60 min and 85 °C for 5 min. Quantita-
tive RT–PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Sequence 
Detection System using a SYBR Green PCR kit. The PCR reactions under-
went initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and were then amplified 
for 40 cycles, with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 
30 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.
For miRNA expression analysis, cDNAs were synthesized from 
500 ng of total RNA using the miRNA 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit 
(Vazyme) with the stem-loop method. The reverse transcription reac-
tion was carried out at 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min and 85 °C for 
5 min. Quantitative RT–PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 
7300 Sequence Detection System using miRNA Universal SYBR qPCR 
Master Mix (Vazyme) in a 96-well optical plate. The thermal cycling 
conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, 
followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All reactions 
were run in triplicate.
After completion of the reactions, the CT values were determined 
using fixed threshold settings, and the mean CT was calculated from 
triplicate PCR measurements. The 2−ΔΔCT method was employed to 
determine the relative expression of RNAs, with β-actin mRNA serving 
as the internal control for quantification of mRNAs and miR-16 serv-
ing as the internal control for quantification of miRNAs. The primer 
sequences used are provided in Supplementary Table 5.
Measurement of ATP
The rate of ATP synthesis was determined using an ATP Determination 
Kit (Biovision) following the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay 
employs luciferase to facilitate the production of light from ATP and 
luciferin, which is subsequently measured using a luminometer. In brief, 
samples were homogenized with a nuclear releasing buffer for 5 min at 
room temperature. After this, lysate was added to the ATP monitoring 
enzyme for the calculation of ATP synthesis within 1 min using a lumi-
nometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein 
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and applied for data normalization.
Measurement of relative mtDNA content
mtDNA copy number was quantified using quantitative PCR, following 
a previously described protocol31. In brief, total DNA was extracted from 
tissues and cells using a DNA extraction kit (Biomed), in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions79. A total of 10 ng of DNA was 
used for quantitative PCR analysis. The relative mtDNA copy number 
was determined by measuring the amplification of mitochondrially 
encoded genes, including cytochrome c oxidase I (MT-CO1), NADH dehy-
drogenase 1 (MT-ND1), cytochrome c oxidase III (MT-CO3) and the D-loop 
region. These measurements were normalized to β2-microglobulin 
(β2-MG). The primer sequences used in the mtDNA assay are provided 
in Supplementary Table 5.
Measurement of mitochondrial complex V activity
The activity of mitochondrial complex V was assessed using a mito-
chondrial respiratory chain complex V activity detection kit (Yifeixue 
Bio Tech), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 
tissues or cells were homogenized or ground, and mitochondria were 
extracted. Sonication was performed on ice using an ultrasonic cell 
disruptor (Sonics) at 200 W for 3 s, repeated 30 times at 10-s intervals. 
After a 30-min enzymatic reaction and a 10-min chromogenic reaction, 
the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Molecular 
Devices).
SDHA immunofluorescence staining and SDH staining
SDHA immunofluorescence staining and SDH staining were performed 
following previously established protocols with slight modifications80. 
Muscle tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH = 7.4) 
for 48 h at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were then dehydrated using a 30% 
sucrose solution. Cryosectioning was performed using a cryomi-
crotome (Leica). The sections were subsequently incubated overnight 
with a mouse anti-SDHA primary antibody (1:500, Abcam, ab814715), 
followed by staining with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the 
sections were imaged using a confocal microscope (Nikon).
For SDH staining, mouse muscle samples were immediately 
immersed in OCT solution and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen sections with 
a thickness of 7 μm were prepared using a cryostat (Leica). These 
sections were then incubated with SDH reaction reagent at 37 °C for 
40 min. After the enzymatic reaction, the reaction was halted by a 
rapid immersion in ddH2O and subsequent air drying for 10 min in the 
absence of light. Capturing images of the sections was conducted using 
a microscope (Nikon). The staining intensity of SDH in the images was 
quantified using ImageJ software.
TEM analysis of the mitochondrial ultrastructure
Hippocampal and muscle samples were trimmed to 2 mm3 and fixed 
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the samples 
underwent treatment with 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydration 
through a gradient of ethanol solutions. After staining with 1% urany-
lacetate and dehydration in acetone, samples were sliced into ultra-thin 
sections (80 nm) and loaded on electron microscopy grids. Images 
were acquired using a Hitachi TEM system (Hitachi, HT7700) operat-
ing at an acceleration voltage of 80.0 kV. The number of mitochon-
dria was calculated in three fields for each sample section at ×20,000 
magnification. The ultrastructure of mitochondria was captured at 
×70,000 magnification and was identified as damaged if samples 
had disrupted membranes, cristae depletion, matrix dissolution and  
vacuolization.
Cell culture
The mouse embryonic neural stem cell line NE-4C and mouse myoblast 
cell line C2C12 were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biol-
ogy, Chinese Academy of Sciences. NE-4C cells were cultured in com-
plete mouse neural stem cell medium (Procell) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To 
facilitate NE-4C cell adhesion and growth, 10 μg ml−1 poly-l-lysine was 
applied to the flask for at least 2 h before cell passage and cultivation. 
Furthermore, NE-4C cells were passaged using 0.05% trypsin instead 
of 0.25% trypsin. C2C12 cells were maintained in high-glucose (4.5 g L−1) 
DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10099141C) and 
cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
Upon reaching 70% confluence, NE-4C cells were subjected to 
neuronal differentiation by supplementing the culture medium with 
10 μM retinoic acid. After a 6-d differentiation period, NE-4C cells 
were either co-cultured with sEVs or transfected with miRNA mim-
ics and antisenses. Similarly, C2C12 cells were induced to undergo 
the myoblast–myotube transition by switching the growth medium 
to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse 
serum) when they reached 90% confluence. After 1 d, C2C12 cells were 
either co-cultured with sEVs or transfected with miRNA mimics and  
antisenses.

Induction of cell senescence with high dose of H2O2
Cell senescence was induced following a previously described proto-
col81. On the first day, cells were cultured in T175 flasks and assessed 
under an inverted microscope (Nikon) to ensure that they reached 
approximately 50% confluence. If the cells had reached the desired con-
fluence, the complete growth media were replaced with pre-warmed 
basal media containing 1.0 mM H2O2. The cells were then incubated 
in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the basal media 
were changed back to complete growth media, and the cells were fur-
ther incubated at 37 °C for the next 23 h. The next day, the cells were 
examined under an inverted microscope to confirm their viability and 
health. Subsequently, the complete growth media were replaced with 
pre-warmed basal media containing 750 μM H2O2. The cells were once 
again incubated in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. After that, 
the basal media were changed back to complete growth media, and 
the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 23 h. The aforementioned 
steps were repeated four times until day 6 to induce cell senescence.
Co-culture with sEVs and transfection with synthetic RNAs
For the co-culture experiments with sEVs, sEVs (50 μg of total protein 
content) were incubated with 1 × 106 NE-4C or C2C12 cells and cultured 
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 24 h, total RNA 
and protein were extracted from the cells. For cell transfection experi-
ments, 50 pmol of miRNA mimics, antisense miRNAs or corresponding 
scrambled RNA (scrRNA) (GenePharma) were transfected into NE-4C 
or C2C12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA and protein were extracted 
48 h after transfection. The sequences of the synthetic miRNA mimics 
and antisenses can be found in Supplementary Table 6.
EdU incorporation assay
An EdU incorporation assay was conducted following the previously 
described protocol with slight modifications82. NE-4C or C2C12 cells 
were seeded in 48-well plates after co-culture with sEVs or transfection 
with miRNA mimics or antisenses. When cells reached 80% confluence, 
they were treated with EdU reagent (RiboBio, C10310-1) to assess cell 
proliferation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell nuclei 
were stained using DAPI (Beyotime Biotechnology), and the stained 
cells were visualized using a BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus).
Measurement of OCR
OCR was analyzed using an XF96 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). In 
brief, 2 × 104 cells per well were plated in Seahorse XF96 plates in 200 μl 
of DMEM supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine 
and 10 mM glucose. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 
humidified incubator without CO2. After assessing the OCR at baseline, 
the following compounds were sequentially added to the analyzer, 
and the change in OCR was measured: (1) oligomycin (1.5 μM), which 
blocks ATP synthase and reduces OCR, representing mitochondrial 
respiration associated with cellular ATP production (ATP-coupled 
OCR); (2) carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone 
(FCCP, 0.5 μM), a mitochondrial uncoupler that enables maximal rates 
of electron transport and measures the maximal respiratory capacity 
(maximal OCR); and (3) a combination of rotenone and antimycin A 
(0.5 μM), which blocks respiratory electron flux through complexes I 
and III and inhibits mitochondrial respiration. All OCR measurements 
were normalized to the cell number in each well.
Small RNA deep sequencing
Small RNA deep sequencing was conducted by BGI (Shenzhen) using 
a TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) for the construction 
of small RNA libraries. After the quality validation of these libraries, 
raw data were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. 
The clean reads were obtained through data filtration. Sequences 
corresponding to mature miRNAs and their precursors were extracted 
from miRBase version 21. Subsequently, the clean reads were aligned 
to reference sequences and annotated using the Bowtie algorithm. 
Only candidates with no more than one mismatch and not exceeding 
two shifts were considered as miRNA matches. Statistical analysis was 
conducted using Student’s t-test, with statistical significance defined 
as uncorrected P < 0.05 and |fold change| > 2. The average expression 
threshold was set at more than 50 reads.
Literature mining of age-related circulating miRNAs
Age-related circulating miRNAs were identified through a 
PubMed-based literature mining approach. In brief, we conducted 
searches using several keywords, such as ‘plasma miRNA AND aging’, 
‘serum miRNA AND aging’, ‘plasma miRNA AND metabolism’ and ‘serum 
miRNA AND metabolism’, on PubMed, applying the ‘Original article’ 
filter. We extracted all miRNAs reported in the literature and con-
solidated them after removing duplicates. A total of 458 miRNAs were 
identified in the published studies and subjected to further manual 
classification analysis. miRNAs were included if the studies focused 
on mouse or human miRNAs, if miRNA levels were measured using 
RNA deep sequencing or quantitative RT–PCR and if miRNAs were 
examined in at least three published papers. miRNAs were excluded 
if contradictory reports existed regarding their alterations in aged 
plasma (serum) compared to young plasma (serum). Ultimately, we 
identified 90 age-related circulating miRNAs, comprising 53 that 
exhibited increased levels and 37 that showed decreased levels with 
advancing age.
Statistics and reproducibility
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism version 8 
(GraphPad Software) or the open-source statistical package R. Sig-
nificance was determined using two-sided Student’s t-test or one-way 
ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Significance 
was assumed at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.005. Details on the 
statistics used can be found in the figure legends. No animals or data 
points were omitted from the analysis for any particular reason. The 
data are presented as the means ± s.e.m. n represents the number 
of samples used in the experiments. All micrographs and blots were 
representative of three independent experiments.
