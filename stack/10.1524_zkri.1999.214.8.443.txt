Abstract.
The one-dimensional Ising model can explain
the different stackings of close-packed alloys by attractive
(hici) or repulsive (ch) interactions between metal atoms.
A similar analysis explains the ordering in the hexagonal
planes. The three-dimensional analysis of ordered hep and
ccp alloys shows the existence of different families of
structures and the construction from structural units e.g. to
long-range ordered alloys with antiphase boundaries
or
shearing.
1. Introduction
Most of the metals, many alloys and the noble gases (with
very weak van der Waals forces) crystallize in hexagonal
close-packed {hep), cubic close-packed (ccp) or complex
close-packed
structures (Strukturbericht,
1931;
Pearson,
1967/1972; Beck, 1969; Wyckoff, 1982; Villars and Cal-
vert, 1986; Parthe et al. 1993; Hauck and Mika, 1994).
Some elements forming molecules as e.g. O2, Fo, h, B12
(Pauling,
1945/1960; Wyckoff,
1982)
or C60
fullerene
(David et al., 1991) crystallize in close-packed structures
with rotational disorder of the molecules occurring at in-
creased temperatures. The situation is similar as in some
alloys MVNV, where M and N atoms are disordered at in-
creased temperatures. A phase transition at low tempera-
tures indicates weak interactions. The attractive or repul-
sive
interactions between
atoms
in hep
or ccp alloys

and
Katsura,

and
Kakehashi.

and

1985;
Ducastelle,
1991; Turchi, 1994 were varied systematically to simulate
the ordering of M and N atoms. The procedure is similar
to that of magnetic ordering (Ising, 1925). Structure maps
containing different ordered structures were obtained for
different pairwise interactions V„ i = 1, 2, 3,... between
nearest, next-nearest, third-nearest etc. metal atoms. Some
structure maps use ratios e.g. V2/V4, V3/V4 or V1/V5, V2/V5
as axes, to simulate complicated crystal structures.
Another type of structure map contains the metal atom
radii, electronegativity and number of electrons as param-
eters (Villars
and Hulliger,
1987; Villars
et al.,
1989;
Pettifor,
1994).
These
structure
maps contain
areas of

close-packed structures with the coordination number
12
of each metal atom.
We have extended the numerical analysis of the envi-
ronment from the 12 nearest neighbors to metal atoms at
larger distances (Hauck
et
al.,
I988a/1989) using
the
mathematical
formulas of Patterson
and Kasper (1959/
1967). All structures from the different compilations, from
the simplest to the long-period ordered structures (Schu-
bert, 1964/1967; Sato and Toth, 1965; Ogawa, 1974), can
be ordered by this procedure in structure maps with the
self-coordination numbers (s-CN) of the nearest, next-near-
est and third-nearest neighbors, 7), 72, 73 and the ratio y/x
of N and M atoms in MVNV as parameters. This notation is
similar as for structures obtained by variation of the pair-
wise interactions (Kanamori and Kakehashi, 1977). The
comparison
shows
that
the
interactions
between
metal
atoms varies with the s-CN values from attractive at low
72 to repulsive at high 72 values. The different interactions
are related to different metal atom radii, electronegativity
and
number of electrons
in
a
very complex
manner
(Schubert, 1964/1967; Sato and Toth, 1965; Ogawa, 1974:
Villars, 1994). Most experimental structures are at the bor-
ders of these structure maps and can be classified in struc-
ture families with different structural units. The structures
can be characterized by the sequences of structural units
and are named by the pioneers similar as e.g. the Ruddles-
den-Popper, Aurivillius or high Tc superconducting oxide
phases (Hauck and Mika, 1998a).
2. Analysis of the stacking sequences
by the one-dimensional Ising model
In pure metals, the bonding tendencies of the individual
atoms should be identical. The same environment can be
expected for each metal atom
as e.g. strong directional
covalent bonds as in gray a-Sn with the diamond structure
or a close-packing of spherical metal atoms as in Mg or
Cu. Metal atoms with weak bonding behave like tennis
balls packed in a basket. The packing consists of coplanar
hexagonal layers (Fig. 1).
Succesive layers
are
stacked
with centers of spheres at A, B or C positions. The differ-
ent stacking sequences of hexagonal layers can be charac-
terized by the sequence of positions. The periodic
se-
quences AB of two layers and ABC of three layers are
called hexagonal close-packed (hep or h) and cubic close-

packed (ccp or c), because of the hexagonal and cubic
symmetry, respectively. The hep and ccp metal structures
are usually distinguished by the prototype elements Mg
and Cu, the space group and Pearson symbols (Table 1).
Most metals (except Eu, U and Np) can be obtained in a
close-packed modification (Villars and Calvert, 1986).
A few metals crystallize in more complex close-packed
structures with a maximum of nine layers (Table 1). These
structures can be described unambiguously by the stacking
symbols /? and
c introduced by Pauling and Jagodzinski
(Pearson, 1972; Mardix, 1990). This notation describes a
layer as h or e type according to whether the layers on
each side of it
are of the
same type, such
as for B in
ABA, or of different types as for B in ABC (Fig. 1). The
two-layer hep sequence AB gets the symbol hh or h, the
three-layer ccp sequence ABC the symbol ccc or c. The
lanthanides La to Sm, Gd and the actinides Am to Cf
crystallize in the ABAC or ehch
— (0/2)2 stacking. Sm, Gd
and the heavier lanthanides Tb to Ho, Tm, Lu can crystal-
lize
also
in
the ABABCBCAC
or chhchhchh = (0/2/2)3
stacking. A comparison of the stacking symbols and popu-
lation data in Table
1 shows the preference of the elemen-
tal metals for simple sequences hh, ccc, (0/2)2, (hcc)2 or
(0/2/7)3. Some more complex sequences are found in alloys
M.VNV (Table 1), which are discussed in Section 6.
Fig. 2. Structure map of a linear chain of c and h or a and b with the
self-coordination numbers T\, T2 of nearest and next-nearest neigh-
bors (a) or the short-range order parameters a\,a2 as axes (b). Single
(S), double (D), triple (T), or multiple (M) rows of a unit occurs in
ab,„ abab„, ababab„ and ab, respectively. The quasicrystal (QC) with
a Fibonacci sequence of a and b is at ab2lab = r.
The stacking sequence can be analyzed by the one-di-
mensional Ising model. The sequences of layers h and c
can be compared with
a one-dimensional chain of atoms
with (+) or (—) spin (Ising, 1925) or M and N atoms
(Ducastelle, 1991). The large variety of chains is charac-
terized by
the self-coordination numbers (s-CA0 of M
atoms (or h layers) to construct a structure map (Fig. 2).
Each h layer of the sequence chchch e.g. has no nearest
h layers, two next-nearest h layers and
no third-nearest
neighbors of h layers. The sequence of layers is character-
ized by the three s-CN values T\ =0, T2 = 2, T3 = 0 and
the total composition ylx =
1 of c and h layers cxhy. The
notation 0 2 0;
1 for the sequence chchch is identical for
c and h layers at ylx =
1 and deviates for ylx 7^
1
as e.g.
0 0 2; 2 for
/1 or
1
1 2; 0.5 for c in the hc2 stacking
sequence. The T,M values of the minority component and
Tf
of the majority
component give identical Cowley
short-range order parameters a,- (Ducastelle, 1991; Hauck
et al., 1988a).
Structure maps with T(M or a, values as parameters can
be obtained by the following procedure:
(1) The coordination numbers of each shell
are aver-
aged for structures which have different 7} values as e.g.

(2) The crystal structures characterized by the coordina-
tion numbers T\, Ti, T$ and a fixed composition ylx can
be plotted as single points in a T\, T2, T3 coordinate sys-
tem or as projection in the T\, T2 plane
as outlined for
T\T2Tt,\
1 structures in Fig. 2. All structures with ylx = 1
are found to fall within a triangle, with the three structures
0 2 0;
1 (for ch),
1 0 2;
1 (for h2c2) and
2 2 2; (1)
(hooCoo for segregation of h and c layers) at the corners.
The structure 2 2 2; (1) with the composition given by
(1) in brackets is used to indicate that the structure can
only be obtained in the limit of very large stacks and a
negligible border between h and c layers.
(3) The sequences at the left hand border of the struc-
ture map as e.g. C3/V3 or C4/24 contain increasing segments
h„ and c,„ which
are segregated at the lower left hand
corner for n —> 00. The sequences at the right hand border
of the structure map at ylx =
1
as e.g. hch2c2 are a combi-
nation of h2c2 and he (= ch) at the upper and lower cor-
ners of the border, respectively. (The sequence ch2chc2h
can be considered
as a combination of ch2, hc2, c and h
layers.)
(4) Structures T\T2Ty, ylx with different ylx values can
be included in the same structure map (Fig. 2b) by using
Cowley's
short-range
order
parameter
a,
(Ducastelle,
1991), which can vary within —1 < a,- < 1. The a, values
can be obtained from the coordination numbers 7^ and
77^ of M and N atoms or from the

2 are the maximum s-CN values of
the linear chain. The coordination numbers 7"!^ and Tf of
h and c layers are identical at composition r =
1 but dif-
ferent at other compositions. The area mapped out by the
maximum range of GEi, a2 values is different at different
compositions, as outlined for r = 2 and 3 in Fig. 2b.
(5) The a, values are zero for a random distribution of
h and c layers, because the mean value of T(M +
equals
T"r,lx,
which
corresponds
e.g.
to
T\
= T2 =
T3 =
2/(r+ 1) (Fig. 2). Very small a, values are expected for
alloys with very weak interactions and in particular at
high temperatures Positive a\ values are obtained for at-
tractive interactions of M atoms, i.e. for cluster formation
or segregation. The
1
0 2;
1 (h2c2) structure of Fig. 2a
consists of double h and
c layers. The size of h and
c
layers is increased e.g. in 03/23 or C4/24 to complete segrega-
tion hocCoc of h and c layers in the 2 2 2; (1) structure.
Negative ci\ values indicate repulsive interactions between
layers, e.g. Coulomb repulsion for alternating layers
c/2
(0 2 0; 1) at 50% h.

(6) Homometric structures (Patterson. 1944) or homolo-
gous structures (Hauck and Mika. 1994) have the same De-
values.
Atoms of close-packed structures with diameter el =
1
have
T\ = 6
nearest neighbors
in
the
same layer and
T\ = 6 neighbors in the two adjacent layers (three in each)
at distance d (Fig. 1). The number To
— 6 of second-near-
est neighbors
at distance \fld is also identical for all
close-packed structures. The atoms of the hh (hep) struc-
ture, however, have Fj = 2 third-nearest neighbors at dis-
tance a/8/3 J and 18 fourth-nearest neighbors at distance
\/3 d, while atoms of ccc (ccp) packing have 24 third-
nearest neighbors at distance n/3 d (Fig. 1, Table 2). The
coordination polyhedra of 7), To and To, neighbors of the
hep structure correspond to CN 12', CN 6 (octahedron)
and CN 2, and the coordination polyhedra of the ccp lat-
tice to CN
12 (cuboctahedron), CN 6 and CN 24",
as
shown by Villars (1994). The metal
atoms of the
se-
quences
ch„
(n = 1, 2, 3, 6),
hco,
hoc,,
(n = 2, 3)
and
choch?, (Table 1) have M = 2 different values of 7\, T4
and higher coordination shells. The more complex struc-
tures contain three or more metal atoms with different en-
vironments. The averaged F3 and T\ coordination values
of these structures depend on the fraction / of h layers as
given by F3 = 2/ and T4 = 24
— 6/.
The
hh hexagonal close-packed
and
the
ccc cubic
close-packed structures are the only structure types with a
single environment for close and distant neighbors of all
atoms (M1 =1). These structures have been observed in
673 binary
and
ternary
systems (Villars
and Hulliger,
1987). The sequences of layers with two different environ-
ments of metal atoms (M = 2) (Pauling, 1945/1960) (Ta-
ble 1) have been found in 66 systems. The metal atoms of
the other sequences of layers contain three or more differ-
ent environments. The tendency to small numbers M' of
metal atoms with different environment can be described
by Pauling's rule of parsimony: The number of essentially
different kinds of constituents in
a crystal tends
to be
small (Pauling, 1929). The structures with one or two dif-
ferent environments of metal atoms also have the highest
symmetry.
The number M' of metal atoms with different sets of 7}
values is often identical to the number of Wyckoff posi-
tions, the number of symmetrically different atom posi-
tions. For example, the numbers of Wyckoff positions of
the Ms, Cu, Sm and Nd structures are identical to M', but
are larger than M'
as e.g. 5 for the n
— Sb, 9b (M = 3)
structures (Table 1).
The different stacking sequences with n layers in A, B
or C positions can be described by hexagonal unit cells
with the lattice parameters a = b = d (diameter of atoms)
and c = n x/2/3 d (Fig. 1). The smallest unit cell of ccc
packing containing only one metal atom is rhombohedral
with lattice constants a = d and a = 60°. Usually, the ccc
structure is described
as the face-centered cubic lattice
containing
four
metal
atoms
with
lattice
constant
ac = v/2 d. The
c axis of the rhombohedral cell
corre-
sponds to one of the four space diagonals of the cubic
cell.
The only
periodic
three-dimensional
packing
of
spheres having close-packed hexagonal layers in four in-
clined directions is
ccc. All other sequences
are main-
tained in one direction only.
A comparison of the close-packed structures shows that
the interactions between metal atoms, e.g. in the ccc Cu
structure, must be strong enough to stabilize the atoms of
the neighboring layers
at the proper position. The M
atoms of the /:c/iC4 structure must be stabilized in the
eighth layer.
The bonding to the three metal atoms in the neighbor-
ing layers is supposed to be delocalized similar e.g. as the
fourth bond in CO2"
groups, because of the threefold
symmetry. A participation of / orbitals is suggested for
bonding in lanthanides or actinides with ch, cho or hco
stacking sequences and M' = 2 different sets of s-C/V val-
ues for atoms at h or c layers. The different positions are
occupied by different
atoms
in NiAs, CdCL C19 and
NbS2 2H HT structures with decreased cla ratios of lattice
constants (Parthe et al., 1993).
An interaction between metal atoms with directional
bonding can also be deduced from the distortion of some
crystal structures. The ratio cla of the lattice constants of
the hh hexagonal close-packed structures of Ca and Sr is
almost ideal with c/a= \/8/3 = 1.63. The cla ratio is
slightly decreased to
1.56 for most hep metals and in-
creased to cla
— 1.86 and 1.89 for Zn and Cd, respectively
(Pauling, 1945/1960; Laves, 1967; Wyckoff, 1982). The
distance between layers is also increased in cubic close-
packed Hg,
Po
and
Te with
the rhombohedral angle
a = 71°
- 103° instead of a = 60° (Villars and Calvert,
1986).
3. Ordering of atoms in hexagonal layers
The hexagonal layer (in h or c position) is the structural
unit of the close-packed metals or alloys (see previous sec-
tion). The M and N
atoms of alloys with composition
MXNV are usually not at different h and
c layers but at
different positions within the hexagonal layers (Beattie,
1967; Lima-de-Faria and Figueiredo, 1969; Beck, 1969;
Parthe et al., 1993).
The self-coordination numbers (s-CAO of nearest, next-
nearest
and third-nearest M
atoms within
a hexagonal
layer were analyzed in a similar procedure as was outlined
for the sequence of h and
c layers in Section 2. Each
metal
atom of
a hexagonal layer has
T™'M = 6 nearest,
jmax
_ g next-nearest and Tf** = 6 third-nearest neigh-

bors at distances d, \/3 d and 2d, respectively (Table 2).
The maximum s-CN values are reduced, if the positions
are occupied by different atoms M and N in alloys MVNV.
The different structures are characterized by the s-CN val-
ues T\,To,To, of the minority component M and the com-
position ylx > 1. Different structures are obtained by varia-
tion of the unit cell, the occupation of different positions
by M atoms to a maximum of 50% and the determination
of the s-CN values of the different M atoms to obtain the
averaged values T\ToTo,;y/x for the characterization of the
structure. The corresponding a\.ai values can be obtained
from the T\, To values by 6a, = 7",-
— (6
— 7}) x/y as was
outlined in Section 2.4. The T\, To or «i,a2 values of the
different structures are plotted in the structure maps.
The a.\,ao structure map (Fig. 3) contains six struc-
tures with a single environment at the corners of an irregu-
lar pentagon with curved borderlines: 6 6 6; (1), 4 2 2;
1,
2 0 2; 2,
2 2 6;
1, 0 0 6; 3,
and 0 6 0;
2. The
2 2 6;
1
and 0 0 6;
3
structures
are homologous with
identical a,- values (Hauck and Mika, 1994). The crystal
structures existing along the different borderlines can be
obtained by a combination of triangles with three and two
M or N atoms at the left hand border and triangles with
one and two M or N atoms at the right hand border. The
0 6 0; 2 structure for example contains triangles with one
M and two N atoms at composition MN2. The dashed
areas of the pentagon with the limiting structures 2 0 2; 2
and 0 6 0; 2 exceed the area at the composition ylx = 1,
because of the impossibility of 3 0 7?;

structures at the comers of a structure map as in Fig. 2.
The hexagonal layers of close-packed structures are those
of Fig. 3 and combinations e.g. of 0 0 6; 3 and 0 2 2; 3
to 0
1 4; 3 (Sections 4-6). The structures at the right
hand border of the map are also common for the ordering
of surface atoms or gas atoms
at (111) surfaces of ccp
metals and are usually characterized by the dimension of
the unit cell (Fig. 3) (Watson et al„ 1994).

4. Hexagonal close-packed structures
The Mg atom positions of the hexagonal close-packed Mg
structure (Table 1) can be substituted by different M and
N atoms in MVNV alloys. The structures of all possible
alloys can be obtained, if the unit cell of the Mg structure
is increased in a systematic way (Hauck and Mika, 1994)
(Table 3), the metal positions occupied by M atoms to a
maximum of 50% and the s-CN values T\,To,Ty, of all
M
atoms
averaged,
to
characterize
the
structure
by
T\ToTo,;y/x. The s-CN values of the N atoms are different
at ylx > 1. The a, values, which can be obtained from the
T values (Section 2.4) are identical for M and N atoms in
binary MVNV alloys. In ternary compounds M,NVR- the a,-
values of M, N and R atoms can be different (Section 8).
The hexagonal close-packed alloys consist of two hexa-
gonal layers in A and B positions with identical environ-
ment of
12
nearest,
6
next-nearest and
2 third-nearest
neighbors at distances d, V2d and s/cT/3 d, respectively
(Fig.
1, Table 2). The maximum a\,ao range of ordered
hep MVNV alloy structures is within
a tetragon with the
12 6 2; (1), 6 0 2; 1, 4 4 2; 1, 4 6 2;
1 (and 0 6 2; 3)
structures at the corners (Fig. 4, 5). The 5 3 0;
1
and
9 3 0;
1
structures are also at the corners in the three-
dimensional a|.a2.a3
space (Mika and Hauck,
1990).
Several
structures
with
a single environment of metal
atoms are inside the structure map. The 9 3 0;
1 structure
with two layers of M atoms followed by two layers of N
atoms can be considered as partially segregated sheets of
M and N atoms (Table 4). The M atoms of the 6 0 2; la
and
6 0 2;
lb
structures
are
clustered
in layers
and
chains, respectively. The M atoms of the remaining struc-
tures of Fig. 5 are as far apart as possible. The 4 6 2;
1 and
0 6 2; 3 structures with identical a,- values correspond to
the AuCd and SnNi.3 structures. These structures are homo-
logous (Hauck and Mika, 1994). The N atom positions of
the 0 6 2; 3 MN3 structure can be occupied by M or M'
atoms to M2N2 (= MN) or MM'N2 alloys (Hauck and Mika,
1994). These structures have 72 = 6. The other experimen-
tal structures are found at lower 72 values.
The architecture of the different
structures built up
from structural subunits is more complicated than for the
chain or hexagonal layer. The construction of MNV alloys
(y = 1,3,5) by combination of structural units
a—o
in
[120] direction and of MN and MN3
structures by the
combination of u, v, x and y units in [220] is shown in
Fig. 5. The CdAu3 structure e.g. can be obtained by the
combination of these units in the sequence uv (Table 4).
The theoretical structures at the left hand border of Fig. 4
and the LiRh structure consist of alternating layers of M
and N atoms. Most of the other structures have layers
with
identical composition
and environment of the M
atoms in these layers (Table 4). Therefore these structures
can also be described by the type and the stacking
se-
quence of hexagonal layers. Layers of N = Ag
or Au
atoms
are alternating in SbAg3 (SbAg/Ag2) and SnAus
(SnAu2/Au.3), to obtain the proper composition. The VAu2
or TaPt2 and ZrAu4 structures (Stolz and Schubert, 1962)
and the SnCu3, CdAu.3 and (Cd, In)Au3 structures (Schu-
bert, 1964)
are the first examples for a combination of
structural units. The Stolz, Schubert family with structural

cal (o) hep structures.
units a-o and the Schubert family of structures with struc-
tural units u—y exhibit different To values (0-4 and 4-6,
respectively) (Table 4).
Only few of the possible MNV alloy
structures (Ta-
ble 3) are realized as alloys LiRh, SbAg3, SnAu.s (Table 4).
Many other structures listed in Table 3 have a higher sym-
metry than the experimental structures. All alloy structures
(except Cd2(,Au72 and Cd|2Au42, Table 4) are at the border
of the structure map with maximum interactions between
M atoms. The theoretical structures 6 0 2; lb and 4 4 2;
1
(Table 4) at comers of the structure map are candidates in
a search for new alloy structures. The 4 4 2;
1 structure
is
observed for Ni'
in  Ni'Ni2Sn2 (Ni3Sn2).
The Ni'
atoms of Ni'-,Ni2ln2 (Nfcln) with hep Ni' contain vacancies
 in Ni3Sn2 (Lidin and Larsson, 1995). The ordering of
M =  or Ni' of these Ni2In related phases can be charac-
terized by the s-C/V values of M as e.g. 0 6 2; 3 for  in
 Fe3Fe4Ge4 (Fe7_xGe4), 1.3
1.3 0; 3 (^6-Cu'D3Cu4Sn4),
1
2 0; 3 (?78-Cu'n3Cu4Sn4) for Cu' in rj6- or ?78-Cu5Sn4
(with structural units v, kh'h' or kh, respectively).
The 6 0 2; la (LiRh) and 6 0 2; lb structures are not
homometric (identical 7) for all atoms for all £), but differ
in the fourth and higher coordination shells (Hauck and
Mika, 1994). These structures at the same location on the

with
identical
7}
values
(z= 1-3). Table 3 shows many "quasi-homometric" MNV
structures a, b, e. The 7} (2 = 1-3) are usually sufficient to
characterize a crystal structure with y/x < 5. The T\ and T2
values are used for structure maps
as a first approxima-
tion. Usually the T\ and T2 values of the structure families
vary with the ratio of structural units.
5. Cubic close-packed structures
The positions of Cu atoms in cubic close-packed (ccp) Cu
(Table 1) can be substituted by different atoms M and N
in MtNv alloys. The reduced rhombohedral cell containing
one Cu
atom (instead of four in the face-centered unit
cell) is increased systematically (Hauck and Mika, 1994)
(Table 5),
and the metal positions
are occupied
to
an
upper limit of 50% by M atoms. The structures with
a
higher percentage of M atoms are identical at an exchange
of N and M atoms. The s-CN or averaged s-CN values of
the minority component M are determined to characterize
the structures by T\T2Ty, y/x. The T\ and T2 values were
plotted in the structure map (Fig. 6), which is equal to the
hep structure map with identical T\ and T2 values (Fig. 4).
Each
metal
atom
of
the
ccp
structure
has
r,™x = 12,T2max = 6
and If" = 24 first-,
second-
and
third-nearest neighbors
at distances d, \/2 d and v3 d
(Fig. 1, Table 2). The maximum T\, T2, T3 values are re-
duced in M,VNV alloys where y/x >
1 (Table 6). There are
28 different structures with
a single environment of M
atoms (Hauck et al., 1988a). The
12 6 24; (1), 6 0 12;
la, b, 4 4 16;
1 and 4 6 8;
1
structures are the limiting
structures (Fig. 6, 7). The 6 0 12; la and b structures are
homometric structures
— structures with identical 7} val-
ues, but different symmetry (Hauck and Mika, 1994). The
0 6 0; 3 AuCu3 structure and the 4 6 8;
1 CuAu struc-
ture are homologous with identical a, values. These struc-
tures can be compared with the hep 0 6 2; 3 SnNi3 and
4 6 2;
1 AuCd structures for the same T\ and T2 values
(Fig. 4). The 4 4 16;
1 UPb and the 0 4 8; 3 TiAl3 struc-
tures correspond to the hep 4 4 2;
1 and 0 4 2; 3 TiCu3
structures. PtV crystallizes in the CuAu or AuCd structure
(Villars and Hulliger, 1987). The 4 4 16;
1 UPb structure
is identical
to
the
NbP
structure (Villars
and Calvert,
1986). The architecture of structures along the
12 6 24;
(1)
— 6 0
12; la boundary is analogous to that for the
hep structures. The M and N atoms are completely segre-
gated in 12 6 24; (1) with decreasing thickness of hexa-
gonal layers progressing along the boundary (Table 6).
Close-packed planes of M
and
N
atoms
alternate
in
6 0 12; la CuPt as in the hep 6 0 2; la LiRh structure.
The ccp structures at low T\, including most experimental
structures,
can
be assembled from
square layers rather
than from hexagonal layers alone
as is the case for hep
structures (Fig. 7). The structures at the upper right hand
border (4a 1 + a2 +
1 =0) can be assembled by two sets
of structural units a-i (Fig. 7). The NaCl related structure
of A1[D2C13 with two vacancies  in the ccp metal lattice
(Ketelaar, 1935) and Mo3Al8 (Forsyth and Gran, 1962) are
the first experimental examples, which
can be obtained
from combination of a and d or h and g structural units,
respectively. The ccp Na positions of the NaCl structure
are substituted by M = Al and N =  in Alrj2Cl3. There-
fore the NaCl related structures with M and N atoms at
Na positions can be characterized by the s-CN values of
M atoms (Hauck et al., 1988b). The same applies for ZnS
related
structures
as e.g. CuFeS2 with the s-C/V values

The compositions of the structural units
are M.(NV with
ylx = 1 (a, b,f, I), 5/3 (k), 2 (g), 3 (c, h), 4 (i) and 5 (d).
The 0 6 0; 3, 0 4 8; 3, 4 6 8;

1 struc-
tures can be split into structural units u, v, x and y, which
can be combined like the parts of a puzzle to obtain the
crystal structures found at the right hand border (Fig. 7).
The u', v', x1 and / units are obtained from the u, v, x and
y units by a variation of the origin. The ZrAl-? structure
(Brauer, 1939) is obtained from
v and v1 units and the
CuAu II structure (Johansson and Linde, 1936) from
a
combination of the x and y structural units. The MN2
structures ZrGa2, HfGa2, ZrSi2, and the NbsGai3 structure
are obtained by combination of u, v, x and y units (Ta-
ble 6). The sequences of structural units are also observed
in NaCl
related
structures like DNbsDOs (w2), M0O3
(uxv'x'u'),
Nb307F {mxv'^xm)
and
R-Nb20s
{xv'^xut)
(Hyde and Andersson, 1989). Some of these structures are

usually described by antiphase boundaries
or shearing.
The uu'y' structural units e.g. of ZrSi2 with uu'y'v'vy se-
quence can be shifted to the v'vy units as is indicated by
an arrow in Fig. 7. Other sequences like vyu in ZrGai
(vyuuyv) are symmetrical.
Most of the experimental structures are at boundary lines
for the given composition. The only exception in Table 6 is
V4Z115, which lies at the boundary line of the structure map
belonging to the hexagonal layer (Fig. 3) (Hauck and Mika,
1994). Structures, which are not at the boundary line of the
structure map, are supposed to be unstable at low tempera-
tures with respect to other structures at the boundary with
maximum interactions between M atoms. Sometimes M
atoms on one position are disordered, in other cases several
positions are disordered (Hauck and Mika, 1994) and give
rise to decreased a-, values.
The structures with
a single environment of M atoms
can be characterized by square (Hauck and Mika, 1994) or
hexagonal layers with small unit cells:

The structures with M > 2 (Table 6) of the Johansson,
Linde and Brauer families
as e.g. the CuAu II or ZrAl3
structure at the right hand boundary of the structure map
(Fig. 6) consist of u, v, x, y structural units, which
are
connected by 0 4 4;
1 square planes. The other layers of
the CuAu—UPb and AuCu3—TiAl3 parent structures do
not fit together. The structural units of many structures on
the right hand side of the structure map (Fig. 6) are con-
nected by 2 0 4;
1
or 0 4 4;
1 square planes (Table 6).
Most (theoretical) structures on the left hand side of the
structure
map
are connected by
6 6 6; (1) hexagonal
planes.
The 0.1,0:2 values of the different layers of a structure
are sometimes similar to the ai,a2 values of the structure
itself (Fig. 3, 6) and are located in the same area of the
structure map. An example is the 2 0 4;

0 2 0; 2 and 2 0 2; 2 square layers or the 2 0 2; 2 and
0 6 0; 2 hexagonal layers are at different locations of the
structure maps, probably because of the directional bond-
ing of Mo atoms (Hauck and Mika, 1994).
Some metals like Mo, which do not form close-packed
structures because of directional bonding of the outer elec-
trons, form close-packed structures in alloys as e.g. cubic
close-packed MoNi4 or MoPt2 (Hauck and Mika, 1994).
The directional
interactions between metal atoms, how-
ever, can even be increased on the formation of an alloy.

body-centered cubic structure in spite of the close-packed
structures of the components. Other pairs of metals like
Cu and Rh, with the ccp structure, do
not form com-
pounds at all but segregate as two limited solid solutions.
6. Ordered structures of complex
close-packed alloys
The structure maps for hep and ccp ordered alloys M,NV
are identical with the same numbers of T\ and To values
(Fig. 4, 6). The comparison of Table 4 and 6 shows many
experimental
structures with identical T\
and
To values.
We suppose that also the 7j, To structure maps of struc-
tures with a complex stacking of h and e layers (Table 1)
are identical. The structures with identical T\ and To val-
ues exhibit the same kind of hexagonal layers (Table 7).
They
can be described by the stacking symbol and the
ordering of M and N atoms in the hexagonal planes. The
To, and T4 values can be obtained from the fraction / of
h layers as was outlined in Section 2.
The complex close-packed metals (Table 1) are similar
to hep stacking with only one direction of packing of the
hexagonal layers at occupation with M atoms only. All

structures of Table
I
contain
a three-fold axis in the c
direction of the
stacked layers
at occupation
with
M
atoms only. The metal atoms of the complex structures
of Table
1 have already two or more different environ-
ments. The architecture of the borderline
structures
re-
sembles that of hep alloys containing hexagonal layers of
M atoms. These structures can be divided in five groups
corresponding
to
different
«i,ct2
values
and
different
hexagonal
layers
(Table 7) (Beck,
1969;
Zhao
et al.,
1991; Parthe et al., 1993). The hep CdAu3 structure e.g.
with «| =—0.33,02=0.78
is gradually altered
to the
ccp ZrAl3 structure with different stacking of 0
1 4;
3
hexagonal layers by variation of the Au content or par-
tial
substitution
of
Au by
In
in
the
series:
CdAu3;
Cd(Au, In)2.8 = Cd26(Au, In)72 (Cd|4InxAu7s), Cd(Au, In)3
= Cdu4(Au, In)432 (Cd|sIni0Au75) (Wegst and Schubert,
1958; Schubert, 1964) (Table 7). The ccp 0 0 8; 5 structure
corresponding to hep SnAus and (c/z)2 WAI5 is only ob-
served in the NaCl related V6rjCs (V^Cs) structure with
M=  and N = C (Hauck and Mika, 1994). The MN5
composition is obtained by alternating MN2 and N3 layers.
7. Characterization of structures by sequences
of structural units
Structures
at the left hand border of the structure map
(Fig. 4, 6)
can
be characterized by
the
sequences of
6 6 6; (1) hexagonal layers with different metal atoms as
e.g. LiRhLiRh for hep LiRh (6 0 2; la) or CuPtCuPt for
ccp CuPt (6 0 12; la) (Table 4, 6).
Structures at the right hand border can be characterized
by sequences of structural units, which are linked by com-
mon
interfaces
as
e.g.
uvuv (CdAu3),
vu4vu4 (SnCu3)
(Fig. 5, Table 4) or v4v'4 (ZrAl3), ghi (Mo3Alg) and vyuiyv
(ZrGa2) (Fig. 7, Table 6).
The different series of structures allows a characteriza-
tion of crystal structures by a sequence of structural units
as e.g. aa' for UPb,
or gh for Mn2Au.s
and hgh for
Mo3Als (Fig. 7), or 7j2t>4t>2 for ZrAl3 and vyuiyv for ZrGa2
(Table 6). The three-dimensional structures are described
by one-dimensional sequences of structural units. These
sequences of units
can be analyzed by the one-dimen-
sional Ising model (Fig. 2) with 7,|7,27,3; ylx
—
2 2 2; (1),
1 0
1;
1 and 0 2 0;
1 at segregation of a and b structural
units, and the sequences aabb or ab for attractive or repul-
sive interactions, respectively. Chains of more than two
structural
units like vyu2yv for ZrGa2,
or uiyv^yui for
Ce3Sn7 can be analyzed for clusters (C), single (S), double
(D), triple (T) and multi (M) rows of structural elements
(Hauck
and Mika,
1998a).
The
one-dimensional Ising
model can explain the reason for small numbers of differ-
ent structural units (Pauling's rule of parsimony) like the
examples given before. The longer sequences of structural
units like uu'x'vv'y'u'uxv'vy (Zr, Al) (Si, Al)2 might segre-
gate in uu'y'v'vy (ZrSi2) or other MN2 structures (Table 6)
at variation of temperature or composition.
A special "disorder" is obtained if structural units
a
and b alternate aperiodically with the sequence of Fibo-
nacci numbers n—\, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13,
... The structural
units g (MoPt2) and h (TiAl3) of the Forsyth, Gran family
e.g. vary in the sequence gh or gh2 in Mn?Au_s or Mo3Alx
(Table 6). An aperiodic sequence of gh or gh2 units in the
ratio rw 1.62 (e.g. gh2gh2ghgh2gh
at
n = 5) would be
possible
at stoichiometry Mni.9iAus
or Mo3.u6Als.
The
chain of g and h structural units has an infinite number of

Structure maps for close-packed alloys

7} values with an average of 0 0.76 1.24; r, which is at
the border of the structure map at a2 = 0 (Fig. 2). The
x-ray diagram would show the reflections of the g and
h layers similar e.g.
to the hexagonal layers of h and
c stacking
in
a Fibonacci
sequence with hc2lhc fa 1.62
(Table
1). The aperiodic sequence in
c direction
can be
analyzed as in other one-dimensional Fibonacci sequences
(Steurer, 1990). The s-C/V or a, values of structures with
aperiodic sequences of structural units are at the border of
the structure maps with maximum interactions.
In some NaCl or ZnS related structures like V6rjC5,
LiFeCM or NaFe02 the M =  , Li or Na are disordered at
increased temperatures with a short-range order similar as
in ordered compounds (de Novion, 1995; Hiraga and Hira-
bayashi, 1977; Sauvage et al., 1974; Hauck, 1985). This
can be explained by Pauling's electrovalence rule, which
is obeyed for all NaCl or ZnS related structures at the
upper (4ai + a2 +
1
= 0)
or lower (3a i + 1=0) right
hand border, respectively, of the hep and ccp
structure
maps, respectively (Hauck and Mika,
1998b).
The
se-
quence of structural units is disordered in that case.
8. Conclusions
All possible hexagonal or cubic close-packed alloys MVNV
were determined by increasing the size of reduced unit
cells (Table 3, 5) and an occupation of N atom positions
by M atoms to a maximum of 50%. The crystal structures
are characterized by the self-coordination numbers of M
atoms
and the ratio of N
and
M
atoms
T\T2Ty, ylx.
A structure map is obtained by plotting the 7)- values of
M
atoms
or the Cowley short-range order parameters
a,( —1 < a,- < 1), which
are related to 7) and maximum
7,,lilx values (Table 2) by
aiTmax
_ j.
_ (jjnax
_ r.) %jy
The a, values are identical for M and N atoms of binary
alloys. Therefore each structure of a binary alloy is repre-
sented by
a single point on the structure map. Some ccp
and hep structures are homometric with identical 7) of all
atoms for all i, and some other structures (quasi-homo-
metric structures) differ in higher coordination shells. The
homometric and quasi-homometric structures characterized
by
a, b,
c
are stabilized by about the
same amount of
lattice energy. Structures with low T2 values are stabilized
by attractive interactions between M atoms, and structures
with high T2 values by repulsive interactions. The interac-
tions between M atoms vary for increased T2 values. Most
ordered alloy structures are at the border of the structure
map with maximum interactions between M atoms. Disor-
dered alloys are inside the structure map, with
a random
distribution at «, = 0. The structures at the border of the
structure map are obtained by combinations of structural
units and
are classified in different families, which
are
named by the pioneers who investigated these structures,
Stolz and Schubert (1962) and Schubert (1964) for or-
dered hep alloys, and Ketelaar (1935), Forsyth and Gran
(1962), Johansson and Linde (1936) and Brauer (1939) for
ordered ccp alloys.
The T\, T2 or a\,a2 structure maps of all close-packed
ordered alloys MVNV are identical. The 73 and T4 or a3
and a4 values
can be obtained from the fraction of h
layers. Therefore structures of complex close-packed al-
loys can be characterized by the stacking symbol and the
ordering of M and N atoms in hexagonal planes (Table 7).
The stacking of metal atoms and the ordering of M and N
atoms in hexagonal layers depends on the sizes, electron
numbers and electronegativities of M and N atoms in
a
very
complex
manner
(Schubert.
1964/1967;
Ogawa,
1974; Villars,
1994). Some theoretical
structures
at the
corners of the structure maps with maximum interactions
of M atoms and small unit cells with
a high symmetry
like the hep 6 0 2; lb and 4 4 2;
1 structures (Table 4)
or the complex close-packed
0 0 8;
5 MNs
structures
with alternating MN2
and
N3 layers
can probably
be
synthesized at the proper substitution (Table 7).
Very
few
ordered
ternary alloys
like PdAuCu2
or
 4Co.sGe7 are known (Hauck and Mika, 1994). There are
three sets of 7, values for the metal atoms (or vacancies
 ). The ct\,a2 values are identical for the Cu (4 6 8; 1),
Pd and Au atoms (0 6 0; 3) of the PdAuCu2 structure or
in the same area of the structure map as e.g. for the vacan-
cies (2 2 4; 3),
Co (1.6 4.8 3.2; 2.2)
and
Ge
atoms
(4.6 2.9 9.1; 1.3) of  4Co5Ge7. The ccp AuCu3 (0 6 0; 3)
and CuAu (4 6 8; 1) or the hep SnNi3 (0 6 2; 3) and
AuCd (4 6 2; 1) structures are suitable for ternary alloys
like PdAuCiiT with identical ct\,a2 values. The ccp MoNi4
structure (0 2 8; 4) would be a proper candidate for an
ordered quaternary alloy MoMNNL with identical a,- val-
ues, if part of the Ni atoms could be replaced by M and
N atoms. These structures are homologous with identical
a, values (Hauck and Mika, 1994). Different a, values are
obtained at the stepwise occupation of N atom positions
by M atoms in other cases (Table 3. 5). Few structures
like ccp TiAl3 (0 4 8; 3) and UPb (4 4 16;
1) or hep
TiCu3 (0 4 2; 3) and MN (4 4 2; 1) are "quasi-homolo-
gous" with slightly different a-, values at the border of the
structure map.
The TiPts and V4Zns structures with different 7} and a,
values (Table 6) crystallize even in the same space group
at different ylx and
can be considered
as
one structure
type (Villars and Calvert, 1986), if the V4Zn5 structure is
written as Zn(V4Zn4). The a, values are different and are
not at the border of the structure map for V4Zn>
The number of ternary or quaternary compounds is in-
creased
in
NaCl
related
compounds
like
AlFe3CD3
(0 6 0; 3 for Al and C atoms) or FeNiND (4 6 8;
1 for
all atoms and the vacancy  ) (Hauck and Mika, 1994)
and ZnS related compounds like SnFeCu2S4 (0 4 8; 3 for
Sn, Fe, 4 6 8;
1 for Cu), SnZnCu2S4 (6 4 8; 3 for Sn,
Zn, 4 4 16;
1 for Cu) (Hauck and Mika, 1998b).
If the properties of the three or four components are
too different, then the alloys with different sets of a, val-
ues become unstable and favor structures without close-
packing.
