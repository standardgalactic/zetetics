Abstract
The study of gold jewellery can provide important answers about the diffusion of goldsmith technologies and cultural beliefs 
in Mediterranean World. This work comprises gold ornaments recovered from archaeological contexts dated to the 1st millen-
nium BC in southern Portugal, with special emphasis to two exceptional plaques portraying the Mesopotamian iconography 
of the “tree of life”, in addition to two rings, the so-called nezems, whose prototype also derived from Orientalising contexts. 
The set of gold items is completed with a fragment of an ornament such as a pendant or earring. The jewellery was charac-
terised by p-EDXRF, SEM–EDS and optical microscopy to identify the production techniques and composition, while the 
reflectance transformation imaging technique was used to enhance the study of iconographic motifs. Some manufacturing 
processes were identified, namely the decoration with stamping on the “tree of life” plaques, a technique similar to strip-
drawing on the nezems and the brazing with Au–Ag–(Cu) solder on the small fragment. Overall, the set showed gold alloys 
with highly variable silver contents (11–39 wt%), but rather constant copper amounts (1.8–2.5 wt%). The composition of 
individual items helped to establish associations, such as the use of an identical alloy for the pair of plaques. Moreover, the 
two nezems were made with gold of different purity probably due to economic reasons. Finally, the gold alloy compositions 
were compared with others from different collections in Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Mediterranean region, providing clues 
about the gold alloys used by ancient goldsmith workshops.

Introduction
During the 1st millennium BC, the Mediterranean World 
was a crucible for the dissemination of people, ideas and 
technological knowledge. Metals and metallurgical tech-
nologies were among the most important items diffused all 
over this region, as suggested by silver jewellery recovered 
in Southern Levant that was made with Iberian silver sources 
(Wood et al. 2019; Eshel et al. 2022). There are also indica-
tions of more remote relationships, such as the ninth–seventh 
century BC gold pendants from Northwest China showing 
stylistic features closely related to Mediterranean tradition 
(Liu et al. 2021). In fact, the characterisation of prestige or 
high-status artefacts, like gold jewellery, can provide impor-
tant clues about the spread of production technologies and 
iconographic concepts in ancient chronologies.
This work presents the analytical study of gold jewel-
lery from recently investigated Iron Age archaeological 
contexts in southern Portugal. The emphasis is on a pair 
of gold plaques depicting a “tree of life” motif recovered 
in the Early Iron Age necropolis of Vale Romeira (Silves), 
which is an exceptional and uncommon gold example of 
an emblematic Near Eastern iconography in the Iberian 
Peninsula. The set also includes two gold nezems from the 
Iron Age necropolis of Largo da Feira (Mértola), a type of 
nose-ring or earring whose model originates from the Near 
Eastern region, but which was heavily widespread among 
Phoenician contexts within Iberia (Perea 1991). Contrary 
to the more common nezem types, the pure design and

rarity of the “tree of life” gold plaques strongly suggest a 
distant provenance, thus allowing comparisons between 
creations from local and foreign gold workshops. Addi-
tionally, a small fragment of a gold ornament was also 
studied, probably being part of an earring, pendant or an 
element of a jewel clasp (see, for instance, Correia 2018). 
Such gold fragment was recorded from a context dated to 
the second half of the 1st millennium BC in the walled-
settlement of Castelo Velho de Safara (Moura), and pro-
vided the opportunity to identify goldsmith choices during 
the final stages of the studied protohistoric period.
The gold ornaments were characterised non-invasively 
with portable energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence 
spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy with X-ray 
microanalysis, optical microscopy and reflectance trans-
formation imaging. The methodology allowed to identify 
the composition of gold alloys and to recognise some 
decorative choices, manufacturing methods and joining 
techniques applied in the production of those high-status, 
prestige or emblematic icons. The gold alloy composi-
tions were compared with related cases from the Iberian 
Peninsula and the Mediterranean region, increasing the 
knowledge about gold technology of those protohistoric 
communities.
Archaeological framework
Vale Romeira
The necropolis of Vale Romeira is located in the parish 
of São Bartolomeu de Messines (Silves, southern Por-
tugal) (Fig. 1). At this site, two rectangular stone cists 
made with red sandstone (“grés de Silves”) slabs were 
recorded (Correia 2005, p. 78, n. 162). The cists were 
partially destroyed but it was still possible to verify 
that the burial that took place inside was accompanied 
by grave goods of different nature, which can be dated 
to the sixth century BC. In cist 2 (VR2), the poorly 
preserved, in addition to two decorated gold plaques, 
artefacts in bronze and silver (necklaces and rings, 
some of these with inlaid stone or faience scarabs), 
and glass or vitreous paste beads (many of them ring-
eye black beads) were also recovered.
The VR2 gold plaques exhibit the “tree of life” iconogra-
phy with origin in the Mesopotamian region, an iconogra-
phy widespread to the western world carved on ivory, gold, 
bronze, ceramic and terracotta items (González Prats 1989). 
The two examples studied here show a central tree flanked 
on both sides by an oryx and with a palm leaf in the bottom

(Fig. 2). Each plaque had four riveting holes evidencing that 
they were originally attached to a support, probably made 
of a softer material, such as leather. The pure Near East-
ern design of the “tree of life” iconography of VR2 has a 
close parallel with a ninth century BC gold plaque of Tell 
Halaf, Syria (Bittel 1976, Fig. 308). In the Iberian Penin-
sula, metallic artefacts with such iconography are very rare, 
although a few cases can be mentioned, like a gold pen-
dant from Málaga (María Blázquez 1975, Fig. 54b) and two 
bronze pendants from Crevillent, Alicante (González Prats 
1989, Fig. 1). The smallest example of Crevillent shows a 
design quite similar to the one of VR2 (Fig. 1). In Iberia, the 
“tree of life” with a caprine representation is more common 
among ivory objects, such as a comb from the necropolis 
of La Cruz del Negro, Seville (Aubet 1978, Fig. 5) or that 
from tomb 8 of El Acebuchal, Seville (Aubet 1980, Fig. 2).
Largo da Feira
The necropolis of Largo do Terreiro da Feira or Largo da 
Feira (LF) is located in Mértola, southern Portugal (Fig. 1). 
Recent archaeological surveys at Largo da Feira (nowadays, 
the market place) confirmed the existence of an incinera-
tion necropolis of the sixth − fifth century BC (Miguel et al. 
2019), previously known from old descriptions and records. 
In this necropolis, the cremated remains were deposited 
inside rectangular tombs, like stone cists, excavated in the 
ground rock. The graves are laterally structured by shale 
slabs and covered with a lid composed of large aligned slabs 
of the same material. Several graves were recorded, but most 
burials have been subjected to recent destructions. It was in 
this context that the two nezems were found, not very far 
from each other, but without being possible to assign a pre-
cise location to either of the nezems to each burial.
The LF rings belong to a ritual type—nezem—which 
prototype is original from the Near Eastern region (Perea 
Caveda and García Gandía, 2010). The examples studied 
here have a subcircular section of progressively thinner 
size along the rim from the mesial to the junction area, 
ending in a wire of increasingly thinner diameter and 
coiled on the closed edge of the ring (Fig. 2). The clasp 
type of these rings suggests that they would have been 
worn for a long period. In the Iberian Peninsula, the higher 
concentration of gold nezems was found in the necropo-
lises of Cádiz (Perea 1986, pp. 298–299) and Villaricos, 
Almeria (Rodero et al. 1996, Fig. 11). However, these 
rings are quite common in Phoenician contexts, although 
displaying different characteristics like variable/constant 
thickness, plain/twisted body and distinct winding types. 
According to Almagro-Gorbea et al. (2008), the nezem 
seems to have tended towards increasingly heavier forms 
and higher number of winding turns, thus making the 
Largo da Feira examples an evolved type. Some parallels 
belong to funerary contexts, such as Vinha das Caliças 
4 (Beja, sixth century BC; Arruda et al. 2016), Galeado 
(Odemira, sixth − fifth century BC: a nezem with a twisted

body; Beirão and Gomes 1983, Fig. 14), Olival do Senhor

were found; Gomes 2021), Málaga (Martín Ruiz and 
Fernández Reche 2007, Fig. 8), Medellín (Badajoz, sixth 
century BC; Almagro-Gorbea et al. 2008, figs. 476 and 
479) and El Puntal (Alicante, fourth century BC; Sala 
Sellés and Hernández Alcaraz 1998, Fig. 24). Due to the 
close geographic location, one should also mention a silver 
nezem recovered inside an urn at the necropolis of Cerro 
do Ouro (Ourique; Beirão and Gomes 1980, p. 27) and a 
bronze nezem found in the necropolis of Quinta do Estácio 
6 (Beja; Pereiro et al. 2016).
Castelo Velho de Safara
The site of Castelo Velho de Safara (CVS, Moura, southern 
Portugal, Fig. 1) is located on a rocky outcrop at the con-
fluence of the Safara stream with the Ardila river. The site 
presents a Chalcolithic settlement followed by a prolonged 
hiatus that lasted until the 2nd Iron Age. Such occupation 
started from the middle of 1st millennium BC and extended 
to the Roman Republican period and to the early days of the 
Empire (Soares 2001; Soares and Nabais 2022). During the 
2018 archaeological campaign, a fragment of a gold jewel 
(CVS-899, Fig. 2) was recovered from a Roman Republi-
can stratigraphic unit. However, its attribution to the 2nd 
Iron Age occupation cannot not be discarded due to its very 
small size and its possible mobility within the stratigraphic 
sequence because of the existing slope in the occupation 
area. Additionally, it is not possible to assign a more pre-
cise chronology due to the difficulty in inferring the kind of 
jewel this fragment belonged to. In conclusion, it can only 
be ascertained that the ornament dates between the fourth 
and first century BC.
Methodology
Gold ornaments were firstly subjected to a gentle cleaning to 
remove soil contaminants using an absolute ethanol solution 
in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Manufacturing characteris-
tics and decoration details were studied and recorded with 
a Zeiss Discovery V20 stereomicroscope equipped with a 
Zeiss Axiocam ERc5s digital camera. Elemental com-
positions were determined by portable energy-dispersive 
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (p-EDXRF). The joining 
technique used in the CVS “earring” was characterised by 
scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis 
(SEM–EDS), while the register of the iconographical motifs 
in VR2 jewels was enhanced using the reflectance transfor-
mation imaging (RTI).
Portable energy‑dispersive X‑ray fluorescence 
spectrometry
Gold artefacts were analysed using a Bruker S1 TITAN 
600 p-EDXRF spectrometer equipped with a Rh X-ray 
tube, a 5-mm collimator and a SSD detector. Experimental 
conditions included a HV of 40 kV, a current of 11 μA, a 
Ti/Al filter and 60 s of live time. Quantifications involved 
a fundamental parameters’ calibration using empirical cor-
rections and experimental correction factors determined 
with the analysis of a standard gold alloy (IAEA3: 87.81 
wt% Au, 10.83 wt% Ag and 1.08 wt% Cu). The relative 
errors of quantifications were assessed to be less than 2% 
through the analysis of a standard gold alloy (IAEA4, see 
supplementary table 1). However, the irregular surfaces of 
these gold items will increase the uncertainty of measure-
ments, whose values can be estimated to reach up to 5–7% 
(Bonizzoni et al. 2006).
Scanning electron microscopy with X‑ray 
microanalysis
The solder and joining parts of CVS “earring” were ana-
lysed by scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microa-
nalysis using a Zeiss DSM 962 scanning electron micro-
scope comprising secondary electron imaging mode and 
backscattered electron imaging mode. The microscope is 
coupled to an Oxford Instruments INCAx-sight energy-
dispersive spectrometer with an ultrathin window allow-
ing the detection of low Z elements. Experimental condi-
tions consisted of 20 kV of accelerating voltage, about 
3 A of filament current, 70 μA of emission current and 
25 mm of working distance. Semi-quantitative analysis 
involved ZAF correction factors (Newbury and Ritchie 
2015).
Reflectance transformation imaging
The RTI setup used to register of the iconographical motifs 
of VR2 jewels consists of 45 high-intensity light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) distributed over a hemispherical dome of 
70 cm in diameter (Corregidor et al. 2020). The LEDs are 
controlled by an Arduino board and the digital images 
were obtained with a Canon EOS 700D camera mounted 
on top of the dome. The enhancement of obtained images 
in order to improve the perception of the iconographic 
scene involved the comparison of two imaging process-
ing algorithms available at RTI Viewer code (https://​cultu​
ralhe​ritag​eimag​ing.​org/), namely the luminance unsharp 
masking and the static multilight enhancement (Palma 
et al. 2010).

Results and discussion
Manufacturing characteristics
Both VR2 plaques are composed of a thin sheet with 
four riveting holes, one of which is missing due to the 
item’s fragmentary condition. The front of the plaques 
has a shiny gold appearance due to polishing, while the 
back was left untouched showing a matte finish (Fig. 3). 
The polishing of the visible side was certainly part of the 
production cycle, but it was also induced and somehow 
preserved by the use-wear of these emblematic jewels. 
Additionally, the dull appearance of the back side could 
result from the contact with the support material or the 
lack of use-wear polishing. The closer observation with 
optical microscopy of the stamped decoration revealed 
a good match between the two plaques. Therefore, these 
pieces were decorated by stamping (Hackens and Winkes 
1983), most likely using the same matrix containing the 
iconographic scene. A fourth century BC tomb of Cabezo 
Lucero (Alicante) produced a few exceptional examples of 
such goldsmith working tools, also showing some matrices 
with elaborated decorative motifs (Perea and Armbruster 
2011, Fig. 3). Nevertheless, due to the pure Orientalising 
iconography stamped on the plaques, it seems that their 
provenance should not be searched for within the Iberian 
Peninsula, but in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Simi-
lar evidence of long-distance trade was also suggested 
for an uncommon gold torc from southern France (Las-
graisses, Tarn) showing relations with Greece or Anatolia. 
Moreover, some goldwork such as four funeral masks from 
Trebeništa (North Macedonia) made of embossed and 
hammered gold foil seem to reflect a blending of Greek 
and Central European traditions, possibly suggesting a 
local production with eastern inspiration (Eluère 1985).
The LF nezems have several production traces including 
a longitudinal seam in the middle section, which becomes 
a helix-shaped seam in the ending wire (Fig. 4). Moreover, 
the ending wires show scratches parallel to the longitudinal 
axis. These production traces are quite similar to the charac-
teristic features of strip-drawing of gold wire described by 
Oddy (1977). This method produces rounded cross-section 
wires with an inner hollow, but for soft metals such as gold 
it is possible to continue drawing to eliminate the inner

hollow. Therefore, the manufacture of the rings LF-01 and 
LF-59 may share some features with such method, at least 
in the final narrowing of the terminal sections. In addition, 
the existence of these imperfections indicates a poor finish-
ing work of these supposed prestige symbols. It must be 
considered that this kind of ornament can be manufactured 
not only in gold, but also in silver and bronze, from which 
it can be inferred that not all nezems are prestige artefacts 
or that there will be a gradation of the prestige associated 
to nezems.
The fragment of the jewel CVS-899 shows evidence of 
some type of joining technique to hold the flattened ends 
of the wire to the sub-circular main body (Fig. 4). Ancient 
goldsmiths employed different joining techniques such as 
brazing, solid-state diffusion bonding with copper salts, 
autogenous welding and fusion welding (Soares et al. 
2010; Scrivano et al. 2013; Ortega-Feliu et al. 2018). The 
first two techniques can be identified by the composition 
of the solder alloy or the compositional change induced to 
the joining area. SEM–EDS analyses of the joining areas 
of the earring CVS-899 revealed high gold contents and 
variable amounts of silver and copper (Table 1). These 
results must be considered in line with the surface deple-
tion of the less noble elements, copper and silver, due to 
corrosion and use-wear rubbing and/or corrosion during 
burial. Usually, the corrosion layer is in the range of a few 
microns, so it will have a significant effect in SEM–EDS 
analyses reaching a similar depth (Troalen et al. 2014).

However, the comparison of SEM–EDS values of filler 
material and joining components gives a significant indi-
cation of compositional changes induced by the joining 
technique. In this case, it evidences an enrichment in sil-
ver and/or copper in the filler material, thus indicating the 
brazing with a gold solder enriched in silver, or in silver 
and copper. In this region, the brazing technique was pre-
viously documented in the Early Iron Age gold jewels 
of Monte do Bolor 1/2 and Quinta do Castelo 5 (Valério 
et al. 2019). In Etruscan gold objects, brazing was also 
used for connecting large elements (Guerra et al. 2007), 
but the joining technique by copper diffusion seems to 
be more common among those goldsmiths (Mello et al. 
1983; Scrivano et al. 2017a). The solid-state diffusion 
bonding with copper salts is linked with the Mediterra-
nean region, although it was also identified in some early 
Celtic goldwork, suggesting some connection with Etrus-
can gold technology (Eluère 1989).
The iconographic scene
The record of decoration motifs in VR2 gold plaques was 
improved by reflectance transformation imaging, applying 
the static multilight enhancement and a luminance unsharp 
masking procedures (Fig. 5(A–C)). The last process produced 
visibly better results, possibly due to the high reflectivity of 
the gold alloy. The enhanced illustration clearly shows the 
contours of two oryxes rearing up on their hind legs around 
a central palm tree. On the bottom of each plaque, there is 
a stylised illustration of a palm leaf. Moreover, applying the 
EdgeDetect function from Mathematica software to both 
images, and using a mask to extract the features on the oryxes 
heads, it was possible to observe the match between the two 
plaques and verify the similar details of iconographic motifs 
(Fig. 5(D)). Therefore, the process allowed the improved reg-
ister and comparison of the two iconographic motifs on these 
exceptionally uncommon gold artefacts, which can now be 
properly compared with similar items.
Gold composition
The VR2 plaques are composed by gold with high silver 
content (38–40 wt% Ag) and 2.3–2.5 wt% Cu (Table 2). The 
slightly elevated gold content of the front sides compared to 
the back sides could be due to the polishing of the visible 
side, possibly, during the life span of the item because the 
oxidation of less noble metals has not yet occurred during 
the production of the artefact. The polishing would selec-
tively remove silver alteration products, thus increasing 
the relative percentage of gold in a surface layer. However, 
considering the average composition of the front and back 
sides, it is clear that the two plaques exhibit an analogous 
composition, evidencing that they are in fact a pair made in 
the same goldsmith workshop. The similar stamped motifs 
indicate the use of the same matrix, while minor differences 
(see Fig. 5(D)) may have resulted from manufacturing (e.g. 
movement of the plate during production).
On the contrary, the LF-01 and LF-59 gold nezems have 
different compositions, comprising c. 11 wt% Ag and 1.8 
wt % Cu versus c. 23 wt% Ag and 2.5 wt% Cu (Table 2). 
However, the very similar typological/shape characteristics 
of these rings may indicate the same workshop. The chro-
nology of these jewels must certainly be very similar, which 
makes more likely their shared provenance. The distinct 
alloys composition may only be due to the distinct economic 
power of their owners. Finally, the small jewel from CVS has 
a high gold content (Au with c. 14 wt% Ag and 2.3 wt% Cu, 
Table 2), similar to the one of the LF-01 nezem and indica-
tive of a rich manufacture of a prestige jewel compatible 
with an Iron Age chronology.
Overall, these ornaments show highly variable gold con-
tents (58–87 wt% Au), similarly to other Iron Age gold alloys 
of southwestern Iberia (Fig. 6). The pair of VR2 plaques 
has a composition similar to the set of 11 necklace beads 
and a tongue-shaped pendant recovered in two burials of the 
seventh–sixth century BC necropolis of Monte do Bolor 1/2 
(Valério et al. 2019). The composition of the LF-59 nezem 
(23 wt% Ag and 2.5 wt% Cu) is comparable to 3 tongue-
shaped pendants and 11 necklace beads of Quinta do Castelo 
5 necropolis (Valério et al. 2019). On the other hand, the 
compositions of the LF-01 nezem and the CVS-899 jewel 
(11 wt% Ag and 1.8 wt% Cu; 14 wt% Ag and 2.3 wt% Cu, 
respectively) are analogous to the collection of Iron Age gold 
buttons from Castro dos Ratinhos, Fortios and Outeiro da 
Cabeça (Soares et al. 2010). The southwestern Spanish region 
also yielded jewellery with very high gold contents, such as 
the items from the eighth–sixth century BC treasure of El 
Carambolo (Scrivano et al. 2017b) or from the seventh–sixth 
century BC tombs in Cádiz (Ortega-Feliu et al. 2007). The 
latter seems to be a special case, as it shows gold with highly 
variable silver and copper contents. This feature may be a 
consequence of a large number of workshops operating in

this important production centre or it could reflect the exist-
ence of imports from different places to the Cádiz area.
Native gold usually contains up to 20 − 30 wt% silver, 
although there are primary deposits of essentially pure gold, 
as well as others with silver contents above 50 wt% (Hough 
et al. 2009). In the Iberian Peninsula, artefacts from early 
metallurgical periods rely on unalloyed gold and usually 
have silver contents below 20 wt% (Montero and Rovira 
1991; Murillo-Barroso et al. 2015; Valério et al. 2017). 
Sometimes, electrum (a native gold alloy with silver content 
above 25 wt%) was used, as has been recorded in some Arga-
ric contexts and in the Southwestern Bronze Age hypogeum 
of Belmeque, Serpa (Araújo and Alves 1994). In this respect, 
the LF nezems and CVS jewel show somewhat low silver 
contents (11–23 wt% Ag), while the pair of VR2 plaques 
have much higher silver contents (38–40 wt% Ag) that can 
indicate the use of alloyed gold.
Regarding the copper content, the VR2, LF and CVS 
gold jewellery shows slightly elevated values (1.8–2.5 
wt% Cu), which are absolutely consistent with those of 
gold artefacts of the same period, but not compatible with 
the use of native gold, which typically contains copper 
as a minor or a trace element, i.e. < 1 wt% Cu (see for 
instance, Montero and Rovira 1991; Cojocaru et al. 2003; 
Garcia-Guinea et al. 2005; Ehser et al. 2011). Most of the 
Iron Age gold jewellery of southwestern Iberian Penin-
sula has higher copper contents (average ± standard devia-
tion of 2.4 ± 1.0 wt%, see Fig. 6). The eighth century BC

Lebrija hoard seems to be an exception, showing signifi-
cantly low copper amounts, i.e. < 0.4 wt% Cu (Perea et al. 
2003). The eventual addition of copper to gold could be 
used to produce a harder alloy or to obtain a brighter col-
our (Williams and Ogden 1994). A raised copper content 
can also be a consequence of the recycling of jewellery 
containing copper-rich solders, such as the solder alloys 
identified in gold beads of Monte do Bolor 1/2 and Quinta 
do Castelo 5 (Valério et al. 2019). However, it should be 
emphasised that the use of solders in the Iberian Penin-
sula was only known precisely from the Iron Age onwards 
(Perea et al. 2010).
Studies comprising the composition of Iron Age gold 
jewellery from Eastern Mediterranean and Near East-
ern regions are scarce. A few collections from Thrace 
(fifth–fourth century BC, Kuleff et al. 2009), Greece (sev-
enth–fourth century BC, Karidas et al. 2004) and Cyprus 
(eighth–seventh century BC, Guerra and Rehren 2009) 
evidence a comparable variability of the gold composition 
(Fig. 7). According to these authors, the low-content gold 
alloys (c. 60–90 wt% Au) point to the use of electrum or 
to the alloying of gold with silver and/or copper. On the 
contrary, the pure gold jewels indicate a refining process 
or an exceptionally rich-gold source, such as the super-
gene gold (Hough et al. 2009). In this regard, it should 
be mentioned that the parting of gold from silver only 
dates back from the mid-1st millennium BC (Ramage and 
Craddock 2000). In the Iberian Peninsula, there are some 
examples identified as refined gold, such as two pendants 
of the fourth century BC necropolis of La Albufereta (Ali-
cante) and a pendant of the fourth century BC necropolis 
of El Cigarralejo (Murcia) (Perea 1991). In the Eastern 
Mediterranean region, one could mention, for instance, a 
fourth century BC Thrace wreath showing mostly 98–99 
wt% Au (Lesigyarski et al. 2015).

Conclusions
The integrated study of these emblematic symbols of high-
status recorded in archaeological sites of the southwestern 
end of the Iberian Peninsula allowed to draw some infer-
ences on ancient goldsmith’s technologies. More impor-
tantly, it allows us to underline the Orientalising trade rela-
tions with the extreme south of what is now the Portuguese 
territory during the sixth century BC. In fact, the gold 
plaques from Vale Romeira constitute probable evidence of 
long-distance trade with the Eastern Mediterranean region, 
since the exceptional iconography of the “tree of life” sug-
gests a production centre located not in the Iberian Penin-
sula, but in the eastern region of the then known world. The 
nezems of Largo da Feira and the jewel of Castelo Velho 
de Safara will probably have been produced in local work-
shops, verifying that the alloy composition of these gold 
ornaments, like that one of the plaques, is fully integrated 
in what is usual in the gold metallurgy of the Mediterranean 
region during the Iron Age. Nevertheless, one should point 
out that the two nezems were recovered in association with 
artefacts of clear foreign origin, such as faience scarabs and 
glass/vitreous paste beads.
The production techniques identified include the brazing 
with Au–Ag–(Cu) solder in the jewel of Castelo Velho de 
Safara and a process similar to strip-drawing in the nezems 
of Largo da Feira. The decoration technique of the plaques 
of Vale Romeira comprises the stamping with an elaborated 
matrix containing a “tree of life” design, whose illustration 
was here enhanced with a transformation imaging method. 
The identical alloy composition of the Vale Romeira plaques 
agrees with the joint production in the same workshop. On 
the other hand, the different gold alloys of the two Largo 
da Feira nezems may point to the distinct wealthy of the 
respective owners. Moreover, the relatively high copper con-
tent of all these gold alloys can indicate the use of alloyed 
gold since electrum contains copper at lower level. Further 
conclusions about the gold provenance can only be given 
by future studies involving trace elements, such as those 
concerning the platinum-group element inclusions.
