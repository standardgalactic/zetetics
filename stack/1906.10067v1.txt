Abstract 
Many animals in their natural habitat exhibit collective motion and form complex patterns to tackle 
environmental difficulties. Several physical and biological factors, such as animal motility, 
population densities, and chemical cues, play significant roles in this process. However, very little 
is known about how sensory information interplays with all these factors and controls the dynamics 
of collective response and pattern formation. Here, we use a model organism, Caenorhabditis 
elegans, to study the direct relation between oxygen sensing, pattern formation, and the emergence 
of swarming in active worm aggregates. We find that when thousands of animals gather on food, 
bacteria-mediated decrease in oxygen levels slowed down the animals and triggers motility-
induced phase separation. Three coupled factors—bacterial accumulation, aerotaxis, and 
population density—act together and control the dynamics of pattern formation. Through several 

intermediate stages, aggregates converge to a large scale swarming phase and collectively move 
across the bacterial lawn. Additionally, our theoretical model captures behavioral differences 
resulting from the genetic variations and oxygen sensitivity. Altogether, our study provides many 
physical insights and a new platform for investigating the complex relationship between neural 
sensitivity, collective dynamics, and pattern formation.  
Introduction 
Some animals have remarkable abilities to form complex patterns to cope with environmental 
challenges1-9. Formation of these biological patterns is particularly initiated by aggregation. At 
high population density, animals tend to aggregate as animal to animal interactions cause 
instability in uniform distribution9-12. Different factors such as motility of animals and chemical 
cues can trigger these instabilities by altering the behavior of animals. In particular, sensory 
information plays a primary role in controlling behaviors. Elucidating how environmental factors 
interplay with the sensory information is essential to improve our understanding of pattern 
formation in biological systems. However, this is a challenging problem in complex organisms. 
Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans allows the use of sophisticated experimental tools and the 
results provide very precise information regarding the relation between genes, neural circuits, and 
behaviors13-16. This study is motivated by the possibility of developing a platform that combines 
both neuronal information and the collective dynamics in this model system. 
C. elegans shows a variety of collective responses including, social feeding17-20, starvation-induced 
clustering21, hydrodynamic networking22 and collective swimming23,24. Recent studies have shed 
light on some physical22,25,26 and biological27-29 aspects of these behaviors and their variations. 
Oxygen sensitivity is particularly the main source of the variation. Laboratory strain (N2) is known 

to be solitary nematode with a broad range of oxygen preference while natural isolates exhibit 
strong aggregation and sharp aerotaxis27,30. Further, oxygen sensing, feeding and aggregation 
behavior are all intricately related in C. elegans. Bacteria utilize oxygen for growth and C. elegans 
seeks low oxygen levels for locating the bacteria. However, in a dense population, all these factors 
become extremely coupled31-33. In this study, we aimed to develop a general model dealing with 
the dynamics of all these factors. 
Here, we report that, C. elegans including the laboratory strain (N2), forms complex patterns 
during feeding. When thousands of worms are forced to feed together, aggregation-induced 
bacterial accumulation and oxygen depletion create unstable conditions and further trigger phase 
separations. The principle of phase separation is mainly based on sudden change in the animal’s 
motility11,34. We also found that the dynamics of the entire process is controlled by the sensitivity 
of the oxygen-sensing neurons, which gives rise to strong variations in animals’ collective 
response. Finally, we also observe the convergence of self-organized patterns to the motile 
swarming body as a result of complex interactions between oxygen diffusion, bacterial 
consumption, and motility of animals.  
Results 
To investigate the collective response of C. elegans, we began by imaging animals during food 
search in a crowded environment. We collected thousands of animals (N2) in a droplet and let it 
dry on an agar plate. The droplet was put a few centimeters away from food. After drying, worms 
spread and searched for food by tracing the attractive chemicals. This experimental procedure 
allowed us to increase the worm density around a bacterial lawn to observe their collective 
movement. When animals found the bacteria, they usually slowed down and penetrated the lawn. 

However, we observed that, at high densities the majority of the worms did not penetrate the lawn. 
After reaching the lawn, they suddenly stopped and started accumulating (Fig. 1a). As the worms 
accumulated, they formed a huge aggregate which covered the entrance. Eventually, this large 
aggregate gained motility and swarmed across the lawn (Fig. 1a, 1b, 1c, Supplementary Video 1). 
This observation was quite different from the previously reported response of the reference strain 
N2 which generally behaves solitarily17,32. Further, we tested different mutant strains deficient in 
several sensing mechanisms and essential neuromodulators; we observed similar aggregation and 
swarming response in a wide range of animals (Supplementary Figure 1). We also used various 
types of food sources including B. Subtilis biofilm, filamentous bacteria, or extremely thick 
bacterial lawns. Surprisingly, animals showed very rich collective response ranging from complex 
pattern formations to large scale swarming (Fig. 1d, 1e, 1f, Supplementary Figure 2). Altogether, 
these results suggest that the conditions observed in a dense population can broadly trigger the 
collective response in C. elegans.  
This collective response only occurs on a bacterial lawn. Previous studies reported the same 
conditions for aggregating strains17,32. However, how the presence of bacteria contributes to this 
process is unclear. To clarify this point, we used GFP expressing bacteria (OP50 GFP) to follow 
the entire dynamics. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy revealed that the bacteria are 
concentrated within the aggregates. This bacterial accumulation further promotes the collective 
behavior of animals (Fig. 1f, SupplementaryFigure 3, Supplementary Video 2, 3). Following the 
accumulation of bacteria, the motility of animals is strongly suppressed. The naïve hypothesis 
explaining this observation is that the process is mainly based on the capillary meniscus around 
the animals35,36. When animals form aggregates, the structure becomes porous. Thus, due to the 
capillary effect, the porous aggregate can hold more bacterial suspension. Eventually, concentrated 

bacteria could make the formation of aggregate more favorable by conditioning the oxygen levels. 
We can conclude that concentrated bacteria is the primary factor triggering the formation and the 
maintenance of the aggregation.

collectively swarm on a bacterial lawn. a While searching for food, worms aggregate around the 
edge of the bacterial lawn. Small aggregates merge and form a massive swarm. b Swarming body 
eventually gains motility and moves across the lawn while consuming the bacteria. c A cryo-SEM 
image of the swarming body. The heads and the tails of the animals are buried, and the bodies

on an agar surface under various conditions, such as starvation-induced and on a biofilm. The 
magnified version of the image is given in the supplementary information.  f Fluorescent image of 
worms aggregating near the GFP-labeled bacteria. Due to the capillary effect and diffusion of 
bacteria, worms concentrate the bacteria within the aggregates.  
We then focused on the effects of oxygen on the entire process. Previous studies have already 
shown that the bacterial lawn can decrease oxygen concentration [O2]27,32. To directly observe this 
effect, we used fiber optic sensors to measure [O2] in both bacterial suspension and in the swarming 
body. We observed that the oxygen level drops below 0.1% in the bacterial suspension 

(Supplementary Figure 4). Moreover, we found similar depletion in [O2] in the swarming body 
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Video 4). These results imply that concentrated bacteria deplete [O2] in 
the swarming body. It should be noted that the fiber optic sensor can only be used to record the 
oxygen levels in the swarm liquid. Although [O2] is very low, the animals' bodies can extend on 
the surface of the swarm and they can get sufficient O2 from the environment. Besides the ambient 
environment, wet agar surface can also provide oxygen by lateral surface diffusion. We 
independently validated these contributions by covering the aggregate with a glass slide and by 
using an agar chunk containing oxygen depleting chemical Na2SO3, (Supplementary Figure 5, 
Supplementary Video 5 and 6). Moreover, we observed that Na2SO3 based oxygen depletion on 
the agar surface could initiate the aggregation behavior in the bacteria-free region (Supplementary 
Video 7). From these results we can conclude that animals effectively experience the average O2 
levels defined by the ambient environment and the swarm liquid. Altogether, ambient oxygen 
levels and oxygen depletion are essential factors for aggregation. 
To quantify the effects of [O2] on the motility of animals, we measured the response of the animals 
under changing oxygen concentrations. Figure 2b compares the velocity profiles V(O) of both, 
aggregating strain npr-1 (DA609) and solitary strain N2 and the velocity of the animals moving in 
the bacteria-free region (off-food). Both strains responded to very low [O2] by increasing their 
velocities, which mainly triggers dispersive behavior (Supplementary Video 8). On the contrary, 
npr-1 suppressed its motility around intermediate oxygen levels (7-10%)and showed a sharp 
response when oxygen levels exceeded 15%. In contrast, N2 suppressed its motility in more 
broader range of oxygen levels, but their velocity slowly increased as [O2] reached 21% or more. 
These differences appear to be originating from the sensitivity of the oxygen-sensing neurons URX 
that shape the overall oxygen preferences of the animals26,28,37. Although both npr-1 and N2 

perform aerotaxis at 7-10% oxygen, N2 show weaker aerotactic response, thus, they have broader 
range of oxygen preference. All these critical features of the strains can be extracted from oxygen-
dependent response curve V(O) which is directly related to neuronal sensitivity.

worms create clusters. As the worm density increases, clusters converge to stripes and hole 
patterns. e, f Experimental results of density-dependent pattern formation. e At low worm densities 
(500 worms/cm2), N2 worms do not form patterns. As the density increases, we observed stripes 
(2000 worms/cm2) and holes (6000 worms/cm2). f The strong aerotactic response of npr-1 strain 
enables worms to form patterns even at low densities. Increase in the worm density causes change 
in the instability conditions and tunes the patterns. 
 
Motility suppression behavior has been observed in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria 
to mussels34,38-43. Generally, animals tend to slow down when they come together. The entire 
process is represented by the density dependence of the animal movement which can lead to the 
formation of patterns. However, in C. elegans we observed indirect density-dependent 
suppression. Without bacteria, animals move fast (Fig. 2b). In striking contrast, the presence of 
bacteria results in oxygen depletion and motility suppression. These findings suggest that in the 
dynamics of oxygen, bacterial concentration and animal motility are the essential physical factors 
controlling collective behaviors of C. elegans. 
To gain a more quantitative representation of pattern formation, we developed a mathematical 
model. We followed the notation and the framework developed for active chemotactic particles44. 
We set two separate differential equations to represent worm density (W) and oxygen kinematics 
(O) in two-dimensional space. V(O) is the oxygen-dependent motility response of individual 
animals. This factor served as an experimentally measurable sensory curve of the animals. This 
curve defines competition between diffusivity and aerotactic motility. Both effects became 
minimal around the optimum oxygen level (7–10 %) at which the animals were almost in a 
stationary phase (Fig. 2b). In low oxygen region, dispersion and reversal of aerotaxis promoted 

motility. On the other hand, at high oxygen levels, aerotaxis dominated the dynamics and promoted 
aggregation (Fig. 2c). These are the Keller-Segel like equations45,46 with both, nonlinear diffusion 
and chemotactic sensitivity;

consumption by worms and bacteria. Here, we assume that bacterial density is linearly proportional 
to worm density. Furthermore, the time scale of the bacterial consumption is much longer than the 
aggregation time, thus we ignore the bacterial consumption term in the equations.  
First, we focused on the instability criteria. Following the linear stability analysis of the solution

that

criterion suggests that population density and aerotactic response favor instability; however, 
dispersion of animals opposes it. To verify these conditions, we performed simulations by tuning 
initial worm density. Depending on the density, we observed the formation of uniform distribution, 
aggregates, stripes, and holes (Fig. 2d). These are the basic patterns that are frequently seen in 
many biological systems11,47.

response of worm aggregates to changing ambient oxygen levels. As oxygen level increases, the 
size of the clusters shrink and form circular aggregates which balance the oxygen penetration and 
diffusion. b Measured oxygen concentration in worm aggregates. The dashed red line shows the 
ambient oxygen level. c, d Simulation and experimental results of pattern formation under various 
worm densities and ambient oxygen levels. Patterns are formed when the instability criterion is 
satisfied. The instability zone is bounded by the uniform stable population.  
 
Our simulations also predict that under low aerotactic response, the increase in population density 
could complement the instability criteria and give rise to pattern formation. This is because the 
multiplication of density and aerotactic response simply shifts the dynamics to a new instability 
zone. This prediction could explain the response of solitary N2 in a dense population. N2 shows 
weak aerotactic response which results in broad oxygen preference and patterns only appear in a 
dense environment. On the other hand, the strain npr-1 with sharp aerotactic response can form

similar patterns even at low population density. We tested this hypothesis experimentally (Fig. 2e, 
2f, Supplementary Video 9, 10) and found that N2 forms stripes and hole-like patterns only at high 
population density, whereas npr-1 could form small aggregation patterns even at a low density.

profile gradually extends into the swarm. 
Ambient oxygen is the second experimentally controllable factor driving the dynamics of the 
system. The onset of the pattern formation can be controlled by tuning the ambient oxygen levels 
at a fixed population density. Further, we tested the contribution of ambient oxygen levels to 
pattern formation. To be able to control the [O2], we performed the experiments in a chamber 
where the flow of O2/ N2 mixture is precisely controlled (Supplementary Figure 6). First, we 
measured the [O2] in a large aggregate accumulated around the bacterial lawn. We started the 
experiment at 21% O2 and sequentially decreased the [O2] to 1%. We observed that the aggregates 
response to decrease in O2 level by increasing their surface area (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Figure 7, 
Supplementary Video 11). However, [O2] in the aggregate remained low until it reached 7% (Fig. 
3b). Below this level, the pattern became very porous and oxygen would directly leak into the fiber 
sensor which led to small fluctuations in readings. It should be noted that the [O2] at 1% completely 
randomized the patterns by increasing motility and reversing aerotaxis. Subsequently, we 
increased the [O2] which resulted in similar stripe and hole patterns across the region 
(Supplementary Figure 8, Fig. 3c). We noticed that patterns formed by N2 strain did not change 
significantly during oxygen scans (Supplementary Figure 9). This was expected, because N2 
exhibits low and almost flat aerotactic response within the same range of oxygen levels.  
We further explored the combinatorial effects of oxygen and worm density on pattern formation. 
As predicted by the instability criterion, in a 2-dimensional parameter space, the onset of dot, stripe 
and hole patterns is observed around the zone bounded by high and low uniform animal densities 
(Fig. 3d, 3e). Increase in worm density or decrease in ambient oxygen levels transforms the dot-
shaped structure to stripe and hole patterns. The main intuition behind the pattern evolution can be 
captured by analyzing the oxygen kinematics. Aggregates with circular shapes minimize the 

perimeter and decrease the lateral surface diffusion of the oxygen from the side. However, 
elongated shapes can increase the perimeter and oxygen diffusion in a fixed surface area. 
The other interesting feature of the pattern formation is the coarsening event. We sought to know 
how the shape of the patterns evolves in time at a fixed oxygen level. Our time-lapse imaging 
validates the coarsening (Fig. 4a-c). Interestingly, in later stages, patterns merge and form very 
large aggregates. This type of coarsening shares visual similarities with our initial swarming 
experiments (Fig. 1a, 1b). We noticed that in both cases, the consumption of bacteria is significant 
and may cause an additional impact on the collective dynamics. The similar effect of bacterial 
depletion was also proposed to explain the motion of the aggregating strain npr-125. To investigate 
the details, we measured the bacterial concentration. GFP signal revealed different bacterial 
concentrations across the swarm; the front edge of the swarm has more bacteria than the back (Fig. 
4d-f). Worms in the swarm consumed bacteria and the food continually diffused from the front 
edge towards the back. As the swarm grows, the gradient profile gradually extends into the 
swarming body with the average decay length of around 3–4 mm (Fig. 4g, 4h). 
Next, we tested whether this concentration profile could change the activity of the animals. The 
activity of the animals increased towards the back which suggests that the animals crawling at the 
front edge encountered more bacteria than those at the back. To quantify the activity profile, we 
measured the mean velocity of animals using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis. Indeed, 
the velocity increased towards the back (Supplementary Figure 10). This response is consistent 
with our V(O) curve where the animals perform off-food response. Without availability of bacteria, 
animals start moving fast. On the whole, due to the balance between bacterial consumption and 
diffusion, swarm body gains motility and moves across the bacterial lawn (Supplementary Figure 
11).  

Discussion 
The dynamics of pattern formation in biological systems depend on many intricately related 
factors. The theory of pattern formation in active particles provides a powerful framework to 
explain the complex interactions between these factors38,44. Using Keller-Segel model45,46 and 
motility-induced phase separation principles11,34, our study throws light upon new physical and 
biological insights of this complex dynamics. Our results revealed four essential factors of pattern 
formation. First, hydrodynamic interactions between worms initiate the process of bacterial 
accumulation within the aggregates, which is the first, and a critical step in the pattern formation. 
Second, oxygen dependent motility of the animals controls the competition between aerotaxis and 
animal dispersion. This competition links the neuronal sensitivity to the collective response of the 
animals. Third, the population density can compensate the neuronal sensitivity to convert the 
behavior of solitary animals to aggregation. Finally, a gradient profile is formed across the 
aggregate due to the consumption of bacteria, which leads to the initiation of forward motility and 
swarming behavior. Altogether, experimental results and mathematical models of this study may 
lead to future studies, which will further aid us in understanding the complex dynamics of 
biological systems and in designing a new generation of collective robots48,49. 
Methods 
C. elegans strains  
Strains were grown and maintained under standard conditions unless indicated otherwise. All 
the strains were obtained from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC).

Swarming protocol 
Nematode growth media (NGM) plates having diameter of 9 cm were used for maintaining the 
worms. NGM plates were seeded with 1 ml of OP50 culture. After the worms consumed the 
bacteria, three NGM plates were washed with 1× M9 buffer and the wash was centrifuged twice 
at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. Centrifugation was repeated (up to six times) until a clear supernatant 
was obtained. Since multiple centrifugation cycles might affect the activity of worms, the cycles 
subsequent to the first two cycles were carried out for 10 seconds at 2000 rpm. After cleaning the 
worms, a 150 µl l worm droplet was put on a 6 cm plate seeded with 100 µl (0.5 × 1 cm) of OP50 
culture. The swarming pattern of the worms was observed from day one to day twelve of the 
experiment. The optimum swarming pattern was observed in six days old plates and hence six days 
old plates were used in all further experiments unless indicated otherwise. For NGM plates, M9 
buffer preparation and worm synchronization was done based on the standard protocols given in 
the wormbook.  
Effect of Oxygen levels on Swarming 
A plexiglass chamber was used to control the ambient [O2] (Supplementary Figure 6). A 50 sccm 
mixture of O2 and N2 was used and flow rates were controlled by a flow controller. [O2] was 
measured by using a normal oxygen sensor (PreSens, Microx TX3). At the beginning of the 
swarming experiments, the oxygen levels in the chamber were adjusted to 21%. After swarming 
was first observed, oxygen levels were sequentially decreased to 10%, 7%, 3%, and 1% at an 

interval of ten minutes. Then, oxygen levels were increased in reverse order. The experiments were 
recorded using Thorlabs DCC1545M CMOS camera with a Navitar 7000 TV zoom lens.
