Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation in the brain of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the form of senile 
plaques. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the aggregation process of Aβ also generates smaller soluble misfolded oligom-
ers that contribute to disease progression. One of the mechanisms of Aβ oligomer cytotoxicity is the aberrant interaction of 
these species with the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes, with a consequent increase in cytosolic ­Ca2+ levels, flowing 
from the extracellular space, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we investigated the relationship between 
the increase in ­Ca2+ and ROS levels immediately after the exposure to misfolded protein oligomers, asking whether they are 
simultaneous or instead one precedes the other. Using Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) and type A HypF-N model 
oligomers (OAs), we followed the kinetics of ROS production and ­Ca2+ influx in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and 
rat primary cortical neurons in a variety of conditions. In all cases we found a faster increase of intracellular ­Ca2+ than ROS 
levels, and a lag phase in the latter process. A ­Ca2+-deprived cell medium prevented the increase of intracellular ­Ca2+ ions 
and abolished ROS production. By contrast, treatment with antioxidant agents prevented ROS formation, did not prevent 
the initial ­Ca2+ flux, but allowed the cells to react to the initial calcium dyshomeostasis, restoring later the normal levels of 
the ions. These results reveal a mechanism in which the entry of ­Ca2+ causes the production of ROS in cells challenged by 
aberrant protein oligomers.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common 
neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of 
dementia, is characterized by the extracellular deposition 
in the brain of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the form of 
senile plaques [1] and by the intraneuronal formation of neu-
rofibrillary tangles of the tau protein [2]. The aggregation 
process of Aβ generates a large variety of protein aggregates, 
such as oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils, all characterised 
by high levels of polymorphism [3]. According to the amy-
loid hypothesis, the small diffusible oligomers of Aβ are 
neurotoxic and are thought to contribute to AD develop-
ment and progression [3–5]. Oligomer cytotoxicity appears 
to result, in its early phases, from the aberrant interactions of 
such species with a number of molecular targets on neurons, 
including the lipid bilayer of their cell membranes [1, 3, 5, 
6]. This interaction results in the disruption of cell mem-
branes, compromising its ability to maintain cellular home-
ostasis, and promoting two important early biochemical 
changes. The first is the uncontrolled increase in cytosolic 
calcium ­(Ca2+) levels flowing from the extracellular space 
into the cytosol [7–14], and the second is the accumulation 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10, 11, 15, 16].
It is known that Aβ oligomers are able to interact and 
insert into the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane 
causing the passage through it of small molecules and ions, 
such as free ­Ca2+ ions [6, 7, 11, 17, 18], as well as permitting

the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors function-
ing as ­Ca2+ channels, including the N-methyl-d-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptors [9, 14, 15, 18–21] and the α-amino-
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) 
receptors [14, 15, 18, 19, 22]. In particular, the rapid oli-
gomer-induced activation of extrasynaptic NMDA/AMPA 
receptors is a crucial mechanism in the AD pathogenesis. 
This process takes place through the insertion of the oligom-
ers in the bilayer, which changes the mechanical properties 
of the membrane that is transmitted down to the receptors 
that are therefore activated through their mechanosensitivity, 
without a direct interaction with the oligomers [14]. Other 
­Ca2+ channels that seem to be involved in the Aβ-induced 
flux of ­Ca2+ ions are the transient receptor potential mel-
astatin 2 (TRPM2) [23], the voltage-dependent ­Ca2+ chan-
nels (VDCCs) [24], and the transient receptor potential A1 
(TRPA1) [25].
Another relevant early biochemical change resulting 
from the interaction of Aβ oligomers with cell membranes 
is oxidative stress, which is associated with the accumula-
tion of ROS in the cytosol [10, 11, 15, 16] and represents 
an important determinant in AD pathogenesis [26, 27]. The 
elevation of ROS is caused by the activation of the oxida-
tive metabolism to respond to the intracellular ­Ca2+ increase 
induced by the oligomers and the consequent increased need 
for ATP by the ­Ca2+ pumps, that try to restore the normal 
levels of intracellular ­Ca2+ [10, 28]. It was also observed 
that Aβ aggregation can induce oxidative stress though intra-
mitochondrial mechanisms, with disruption of the electron 
transport chain that initiate ROS production [29–31], or with 
the suppression of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [32]. On 
the other hand, some studies have proposed that the oxi-
dative stress precedes Aβ accumulation and may therefore 
induce amyloid production [29–31]. Analysis performed in 
murine AD models with human overexpression of the amy-
loid precursor protein (APP) showed that lipid peroxidation 
and oxidative damage occurs before Aβ accumulation [33]. 
Moreover, using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells, it 
was observed that ROS produced in mitochondria drove Aβ 
production [34]. Eventually, therefore, Aβ aggregation may 
be both a cause and an effect of oxidative stress.
It is not yet clear, however, if interactions and cause-and-
effect relationships between ROS production and ­Ca2+ sig-
nalling induced by misfolded protein oligomers can be con-
sidered as bidirectional, or whether one of them is causative 
of the other. Oxidative stress has been considered, at least in 
part, a consequence of ­Ca2+ entry into cells, because of the 
increased need to produce ATP by mitochondria to pump out 
­Ca2+ ions, which produces ROS itself [10, 28, 35]. On the 
other hand, ROS can significantly affect ­Ca2+ homeostasis 
in the cell and intracellular ­Ca2+ stores by oxidising multiple 
methionine residues within the ­Ca2+ signalling protein calm-
odulin (CaM) resulting in an inability to activate a range 
of target proteins, including the cell membrane Ca-ATPase 
involved in the maintenance of ­Ca2+ homeostasis [10, 36, 
37]. The analysis reported here allowed to clarify how these 
two mechanisms are interconnected and whether a precise 
cause-and-effect relationship exists. The kinetics of these 
processes in neuroblastoma cells and primary rat cortical 
neurons were analysed under various conditions in which 
ROS production or ­Ca2+ influx induced by misfolded protein 
oligomers were specifically inhibited, showing that the lack 
of an influx of ­Ca2+ ions into the cytosol can reduce the ROS 
production, whereas the protection against ROS formation 
did not prevent the initial ­Ca2+ flux but allowed the cells to 
react, on a longer term, to the initial ­Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, 
restoring the normal levels of the ions.
Materials and methods
Preparation of HypF‑N oligomers and Aβ42 ADDLs
Wild-type HypF-N from E. coli was prepared and purified 
as described [38], and stored at − 80 °C in 20 mM potas-
sium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 2 mM dithiothreitol 
(DTT). Type A oligomers (OAs) were prepared by incubat-
ing HypF-N at 48 μM, with 50 mM acetate buffer, 12% (v/v) 
trifluoroethanol (TFE), 2 mM DTT, pH 5.5, 25 °C, for 4 h 
without agitation, as previously described [38].
Lyophilised Aβ42 (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was 
dissolved in HFIP to 1.0 mM and incubated for 1 h at room 
temperature to allow complete peptide monomerization. 
Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) were prepared 
as described previously [39]. In particular, the HFIP was 
evaporated with a gentle flow of ­N2 and the dried protein 
was resuspended to 5 mM with DMSO and then diluted with 
F-12 HAM to 100 μM. The sample was then incubated at 
4 °C for 24 h and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min to col-
lect the supernatant.
Cell cultures
Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CRL-
2266, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), F-12 HAM with 
25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic 
acid (HEPES) and ­NaHCO3 (1:1) and supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine and 1% 
antibiotics, as reported [40]. Cell cultures were maintained 
in a 5% ­CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and grown until 
they reached 80% confluence for a maximum of 20 passages. 
Primary rat cortical neurons (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were 
plated in 24-well plate at the density of 200,000 cells per 
well and maintained in neuronal basal plus medium (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with GlutaMAX (Gibco) at

the concentration of 0.5 mM and 2% (v/v) B-27 serum-free 
complement (Gibco), in a 5% ­CO2 humidified atmosphere at 
37 °C. Every 4 days the medium was partially replaced with 
fresh one. All the experiments were performed 12–16 days 
after plating.
Cell treatments
SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 6-well plates containing cov-
erslips at a density of 40,000 cells per well at 37 °C. After 
24 h, they were washed with PBS and treated with HypF-N 
OAs diluted in cellular medium at the monomer equivalent 
concentration of 12 µM for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, or with 
Aβ42 ADDLs diluted in cellular medium at the monomer 
equivalent concentration of 1 µM for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 
120 and 180 min. In other sets of experiments, before the 
treatment with HypF-N OAs or Aβ42 ADDLs, SH-SY5Y 
cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 5 µM CNQX, or 10 µM 
memantine, or both. In other sets of experiments, cells were 
pre-treated with 2 µM l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 
for 2 h, with 30 µM Trolox for 1 h, or in a medium without 
­Ca2+ for 1 h. In another set of experiments, the SH-SY5Y 
cells were treated for 10 min with 1 mM NMDA or 50 µM 
AMPA, with or without pre-treatment with 30 µM Trolox 
for 1 h.
Primary rat cortical neurons were plated in 24-well plates 
containing glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine at a 
density of 200,000 cells per well at 37 °C. 12–16 days after 
plating, they were washed with PBS and treated with Aβ42 
ADDLs diluted in cellular medium at the monomer equiva-
lent concentration of 1 µM for 10 and 60 min. In other sets 
of experiments, before the treatment with Aβ42 ADDLs, the 
cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 5 µM CNQX, or 10 µM 
memantine, or 30 µM Trolox.
Measurement of cytosolic free ­Ca2+ levels 
and intracellular ROS production
Cytosolic ­Ca2+ levels were measured in living SH-SY5Y cells 
and primary rat cortical neurons after the different treatments, 
or after adding 1 µM ionomycin for 1 h as a positive control. 
The cells were then washed with PBS and loaded with 4 µM 
Fluo-4 AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. The ­Ca2+ 
levels for untreated cells were evaluated in SH-SY5Y cells 
at each time point, from 0 to 180 min, changing the cellular 
medium at the different time lengths, washing with PBS and 
loading the Fluo-4 AM probe for 10 min. Considering the 
absence of changes in basal ­Ca2+ levels, all data are reported 
relative to untreated cells at time 0. ROS levels were meas-
ured in living SH-SY5Y cells and primary rat cortical neurons 
after the different treatments, or after adding 250 µM ­H2O2 for 
1 h, as a positive control, and then by loading 5 µM 5-(and-
6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate 
(CM-H2DCFDA) in the last 15 min of the different treatments. 
ROS levels for untreated cells were evaluated in SH-SY5Y 
cells at the different time points, changing the cell medium and 
loading the probe in the last 15 min of the treatment. Consider-
ing the absence of significant variation, all data are reported 
relative to untreated cells at 15 min, which is the probe incuba-
tion time and therefore the shortest time that can be analysed. 
Both ­Ca2+ and ROS levels were then evaluated after excitation 
at 488 nm by a TCS SP8 scanning confocal microscopy system 
equipped with an argon laser source (Leica Microsystems).
In another set of experiments, cytosolic ­Ca2+ and ROS lev-
els were measured in living SH-SY5Y cells by loading 5 µM 
X-Rhod-1 AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the last 20 min 
and 5 µM CellRox™ Deep Red Reagent (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) in the last 30 min of the different treatments, respec-
tively. ­Ca2+ and ROS levels were then evaluated after excita-
tion at 561 and 633 nm, respectively, by the same TCS SP8 
scanning confocal microscopy system described above.
In all cases, a series of 1 µm thick optical sections 
(1024 × 1024) was taken through the cell depth for each sam-
ple using a Leica Plan Apo 63 × oil immersion objective and 
projected as a single composite image by superimposition 
(Leica Microsystems). Three different experiments were car-
ried out and 10–22 cells were analysed in each experiment, 
in both ­Ca2+ and ROS analyses, using Image J software. Val-
ues were averaged over the 10–22 cells in each experiment 
and the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were 
determined from the averaged values of the three experi-
ments (n = 3). All data were normalized to the positive con-
trol value, obtained with ionomycin and ­H2O2 respectively, 
which were attributed 100%.
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as means ± SEM (standard error 
of the mean). Comparisons between the different groups 
were performed by Student’s t-test. The single (*;§), dou-
ble (**;§§) and triple (***;§§§) symbols refer to p val-
ues < 0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.001, respectively.
Results
Toxic HypF‑N oligomers increase intracellular ­Ca2+ 
levels and ROS production
We started our analysis using model oligomers formed by 
the protein HypF-N (named type A oligomers, or OAs), 
which were previously found to have effects similar to those 
of Aβ42 oligomers in cell and animal models [10, 11, 38, 41, 
42]. These HypF-N OAs are highly stable, versatile, easy 
to isolate and have a non-toxic counterpart (known as type

B oligomers, or OBs), which is useful as a negative control 
[38].
In a previous work it was shown that the HypF-N 
OAs, similarly to the Aβ42 ADDLs, are able to cause a 
progressive increase of intracellular ­Ca2+ levels on SH-
SY5Y cells by activating rapidly extrasynaptic NMDA 
receptors and, to a lower extent, AMPA receptors [14]. 
We therefore started our analysis by evaluating whether 
the freshly formed toxic HypF-N OAs prepared for this 
study confirmed this effect. The treatment over time of 
SH-SY5Y cells with HypF-N OAs (12  μM monomer 
equivalents) showed a gradual increase of intracellular 
­Ca2+ levels, which was evident already after 5 min and 
reached the maximum level after 30 min of treatment 
(images in Fig. 1a, histograms in Fig. 1b and correspond-
ing kinetic plot in Fig. 1c). When cells were pre-treated 
with CNQX, an AMPA receptor competitive antagonist, or 
with memantine, a NMDA receptor uncompetitive inhibi-
tor, a slight reduction of the OA-induced cytoplasmic ­Ca2+ 
increase was observed in the early stages, up to 10 min 
of treatment, which was more significant with meman-
tine (Fig. 1a–c). This reduction was followed by a gradual 
increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ concentration, until nor-
mal levels reached after 60 min of treatment (Fig. 1a–c). 
Overall, these pre-treatments cause a deceleration of the 
increase of intracellular ­Ca2+ (Fig. 1c). Moreover, after a 
pre-treatment with both CNQX and memantine, the intra-
cellular ­Ca2+ levels remained similar to untreated cells up 
to 15 min of treatment, and significantly lower than those 
of cells without inhibitor pre-treatment up to 60 min of 
oligomer treatment (Fig. 1a,b), further slowing down the 
kinetics of OA-induced ­Ca2+ increase (Fig. 1c).
We then focused our attention on ROS production in 
SH-SY5Y cells with the same conditions of oligomer 
treatment and inhibitor pre-treatment described above. The 
treatment with HypF-N OAs (12 μM monomer equiva-
lents) showed a slow and gradual increase of ROS produc-
tion, which was slower than that observed by monitoring 
­Ca2+ concentration, clearly detectable after 15 min, and 
reaching the maximum level after 30–60 min of treatment 
(images in Fig. 1d, histograms in Fig. 1e and correspond-
ing kinetic plot in Fig. 1f). Cellular pre-treatment with 
CNQX or memantine determined again a reduction of 
cytoplasmic ROS levels in the early stages, up to 30 min of 
oligomer treatment, followed by an increase, until almost 
normal levels were reached after 60 min of treatment 
(Fig. 1d,e). Overall, these pre-treatments caused a decel-
eration of the increase of ROS levels (Fig. 1f), which was 
even more marked than that detected by monitoring intra-
cellular ­Ca2+ levels. Moreover, after a pre-treatment with 
both CNQX and memantine, the ROS levels remained sig-
nificantly lower than those of cells without inhibitor pre-
treatment, up to 60 min of oligomer treatment (Fig. 1d,e).
Comparing the kinetics of cytosolic ­Ca2+ and ROS 
increases induced by HypF-N OAs in the absence of 
NMDA/AMPA inhibitors, the ROS time course appears 
to be slower, particularly in the first minutes (Fig. 2a). 
A lag time appears to be present only in the ROS time 
course, suggesting that the increase of ROS levels follows 
that in ­Ca2+ (Fig. 2a). Comparing the times courses in the 
presence of CNQX, memantine, or both, the ROS time 
course appears again to be slower than the correspond-
ing time course of ­Ca2+ (Fig. 2a–c). Interestingly, we also 
observed a longer delay in ROS level increase following 
pre-treatment with CNQX (Fig. 2a, orange dotted line), 
or memantine (Fig. 2b, blue dotted line) or both (Fig. 2c, 
yellow dotted line) compared to ­Ca2+ levels following the 
same pre-treatment (Fig. 2a–c, orange, blue and yellow 
line, respectively), suggesting that inhibition of AMPA 
and NMDA receptors, with the consequent reduction of 
the early ­Ca2+ influx, allowed the cells to postpone the 
production of ROS even more markedly. Overall, all the 
kinetic data indicate that an increase of intracellular ­Ca2+ 
levels precedes ROS production.

Lysophosphatidylcholine enrichment reduces 
both ­Ca2+ level increase and ROS production
It was previously shown that the enrichment of SH-SY5Y 
cell membranes with 2 μM lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 
inhibits the OA-induced ­Ca2+ flow mediated by the mecha-
nosensitive NMDA receptors, suggesting that the opposing 
force exerted by LPC (compression) effectively inhibits 
the mechanical signal (stretching) generated by the action 
of the oligomers onto the membrane [14]. To investigate 
whether this inhibition is also effective on ROS production, 
we pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with 2 μM LPC for 2 h, and 
then we treated them with HypF-N OAs (12 μM monomer 
equivalents) for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, monitoring both 
intracellular ­Ca2+ and ROS levels. In the presence of LPC, 
the ­Ca2+ levels remained similar to those of untreated cells 
up to 15 min; they then increased, but remained significantly 
lower than those recorded without LPC at corresponding 
time points, even after 60 min of treatment (Fig. 3a,b).
The ROS levels also remained constant for 15 min and 
then increased, but remained significantly lower than the 
corresponding values in the absence of LPC pre-treatment, 
up to 60 min (Fig. 3c,d). These two time courses suggest that 
the LPC-mediated membrane compression is able to inhibit 
the OA-induced ­Ca2+ flow through NMDA receptors for a 
prolonged time and the subsequent rise of ROS levels. They 
also confirm the presence of an interconnection between the 
two mechanisms.
Intracellular ­Ca2+ influx and ROS production 
induced by HypF‑N OAs are connected
As observed in the previous experiments, the intracellular 
rise of free ­Ca2+ is associated with the elevation of ROS 
following treatment with HypF-N OAs. The kinetic traces 
described so far lead to the hypothesis that the second event 
is caused by the first, rather than being independent of it, 
based on the observation that: (i) the former is more rapid 
than the latter, (ii) the rise of ROS has a lag time and fol-
lows the lag-independent rise of ­Ca2+, (iii) the lag times are 
longer in the ROS time courses than in the corresponding 
­Ca2+ time courses in the presence of NMDA/AMPA inhibi-
tors, and (iv) the effects caused by inhibitors of the ­Ca2+ 
flow (CNQX and memantine) are even larger on the time-
dependent increase of ROS than ­Ca2+.

Since these suggestions are only kinetic and, therefore, 
not definitive, we further investigated if the two processes 
are linked to each other in our system with a clear cause-
and-effect relationship between them. For this purpose, 
we treated the SH-SY5Y cells with HypF-N OAs over 
time, after a 1 h pre-treatment with 30 µM Trolox, which 
is a highly soluble and membrane-unbound antioxidant 
analogue of Tocopherol [43]. An increase of cytosolic 
­Ca2+ concentration was observed in the early stages up 
10 min, followed by a reduction down to levels observed 
in untreated cells (Fig. 4a,b, green bars). By contrast, the 
levels of ROS did not increase and were similar to the 
untreated cells at all time points, up to 60 min of OAs 
treatment (Fig. 4c,d, green bars). These results indicate 
that Trolox acted correctly as an antioxidant preventing 
ROS production in cells very effectively within the time 
frame explored here, but it did not prevent the early rise of 
­Ca2+ mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors. However, 
the presence of the antioxidant in the medium allowed 
the cells to re-establish the normal ­Ca2+ homeostasis that 
had been initially lost as a consequence of the activation 
of NMDA and AMPA receptors, indicating that the lack 
of ROS production allows the cells to face effectively the 
stress induced by the HypF-N OAs and the ­Ca2+ flow 
across the cell membrane.
In a control experiment, to assess whether Trolox inter-
feres directly with the AMPA and NMDA receptor opening, 
we activated the two receptors using their specific agonists, 
AMPA and NMDA, respectively, after a 1 h pre-treatment 
with 30 µM Trolox, finding that both agonists are able to 
induce an increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ levels indepen-
dently of the presence of the antioxidant agent (Fig. S2).

With the same purpose of investigating the cause-and-
effect link between ­Ca2+ and ROS level increases, we 
treated the SH-SY5Y cells with HypF-N OAs over time, in 
a ­Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 4, light blue bars). In this case, the 
OA-induced increase of cytosolic ­Ca2+ was fully inhibited, 
up to 60 min (Fig. 4a,b, light blue bars), confirming previ-
ous demonstrations that the source of such intracellular ­Ca2+ 
ions is the extracellular medium rather than intracellular 
organelles [10]. It is interesting to note that a complete inhi-
bition of ROS production was also observed, again up to 
60 min (Fig. 4c,d, light blue bars).
Taken together, the kinetic data obtained with Trolox 
and the ­Ca2+-free medium indicate that the lack of an influx 
of ­Ca2+ ions from the extracellular space into the cytosol 
is able to reduce ROS production, whereas the protection 
against ROS formation does not prevent an initial rise of

intracellular ­Ca2+ concentration, underling the consequential 
nature of ROS formation relative to ­Ca2+ influx. They also 
provide evidence on the existence of an oxidative metabo-
lism required to restore ­Ca2+ homeostasis and responsible 
for ROS accumulation, which does not allow an effective 
pumping of ­Ca2+ ions outside the cells, unless an antioxi-
dant environment maintains the levels of ROS under control, 
allowing the cells to restore ­Ca2+ homeostasis effectively 
(see “Discussion” for further details).
Aβ42 ADDLs oligomers increase intracellular ­Ca2+ 
levels and ROS production
We then extended the analysis carried out with the model 
HypF-N OAs to Aβ oligomers, using Aβ42-derived diffusible 
ligands (Aβ42 ADDLs) [39] at the concentration of 1 μM. In 
previous works it was shown that Aβ42 ADDLs, similarly 
to HypF-N OAs, are able to cause a progressive increase of 
the intracellular ­Ca2+ levels in SH-SY5Y cells by activating 
rapidly extrasynaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors [14]. We 
therefore prepared freshly formed Aβ42 ADDLs oligomers 
and evaluated whether they maintained this effect. The treat-
ment over time of SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ42 ADDLs showed 
a gradual increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ levels, which was 
clearly detectable already after 5 min and reached a plateau 
after 180 min of treatment (images in Fig. 5a, histograms 
in Fig. 5b and corresponding kinetic plot in Fig. 5c). When 
cells were pre-treated with CNQX, with memantine, or with 
both CNQX and memantine, a slight reduction of the Aβ42 
ADDLs-induced cytoplasmic ­Ca2+ increase was observed 
in the early stages, up to 10 min of treatment (Fig. 5a,b). 
With Aβ42 ADDLs, a combination of both inhibitors showed 
kinetics similar to the memantine treatment. This reduction 
was followed by a gradual increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ 
concentration, until normal levels were reached after pro-
longed treatment (Fig. 5a,b). Overall, these pre-treatments 
cause a deceleration of the intracellular ­Ca2+ increase at 
early time points (Fig. 5c).
The treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ42 ADDLs 
under the same conditions also showed a gradual increase 
of ROS production, which was evident after 15 min up to 
180 min, and hence slower than that observed by monitoring 
­Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 5d–f). Interestingly, such increase 
appeared to occur more rapidly than that observed with 
HypF-N OAs, which can be attributed to the known oxi-
dative potential of Aβ42 ADDLs through ­Ca2+-independent 
mechanisms [44–46]. Cellular pre-treatment with CNQX or 
memantine, or both inhibitors, determined again a reduction 
of ROS levels in the early stages, up to 30 min for CNQX and 
60 min for memantine and both inhibitors together, followed 
by a gradual increase, until normal levels were reached after 
90 min (Fig. 5d–f). These pre-treatments, therefore, caused a 
deceleration of the ROS increase mediated by the oligomers 
(Fig. 5f), which was again more marked than that detected 
by monitoring intracellular ­Ca2+ levels. All these results 
confirmed the observation with the HypF-N OAs.
Comparing the ­Ca2+ and ROS kinetics without NMDA/
AMPA inhibitors, the ROS time course appears to be slower 
in the first minutes (Fig. 6a), suggesting that the increase 
of the intracellular ­Ca2+ levels anticipates ROS production. 
Moreover, comparing the times courses in the presence of 
CNQX or memantine, or both, the ROS time courses appear 
again to be slower than the corresponding time courses 
of ­Ca2+ (Fig. 6a–c). Also with this type of oligomers we 
observed a longer delay in ROS level increase following 
pre-treatment with CNQX (Fig. 6a, orange dotted line) or 
memantine (Fig. 6b, blue dotted line) or both (Fig. 6c, yel-
low dotted line), compared to the ­Ca2+ kinetics following 
the same pre-treatment (Fig. 6a,b, orange, blue and yellow 
line, respectively), confirming that the reduction of the early 
­Ca2+ influx, observed by inhibiting the NMDA and AMPA 
receptors, allowed the cells to delay the production of ROS.
When repeated on primary rat cortical neurons, the Aβ42 
ADDLs had a similar effect. After 10 min of treatment, the 
Aβ42 ADDLs induced an increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ 
levels, which further increased after 60 min of treatment 
(Fig. 7a,b). When the cells were pre-treated with CNQX 
or memantine, a significant reduction of the Aβ42 ADDLs-
induced cytoplasmic ­Ca2+ levels was observed after 10 min 
of treatment with the oligomers, confirming the involvement 
of the receptors in the ­Ca2+ influx (Fig. 7a,b). After 60 min 
of treatment with ADDLs, the levels of ­Ca2+ in the pres-
ence of pre-treatment went back to the levels observed in its 
absence (Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, Aβ42 ADDLs also induced 
an increase of ROS levels after 10 min and a further increase 
after 60 min of treatment (Fig. 7c,d), with the former being 
significantly reduced with CNQX or memantine (Fig. 7c,d).
Intracellular ­Ca2+ influx and ROS production 
induced by Aβ42 ADDLs are connected
We then treated SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ42 ADDLs in the 
presence and absence of a pre-treatment for 1 h with the anti-
oxidant Trolox. In the presence of Trolox, an initial increase 
of cytosolic ­Ca2+ concentration was observed, particularly 
after 10–30 min of treatment with the oligomers, followed 
by a reduction at180 min (Fig. 8a,b). These results confirm 
that the maintenance of a redox balance allowed the cells 
to react to the initial ­Ca2+ flux induced by the Aβ42 ADDLs 
and normalize ­Ca2+ homeostasis, initially lost because of the 
action of the oligomers.
With the same purpose, ROS production in SH-SY5Y 
cells was evaluated after treatment with Aβ42 ADDLs over 
time, with or without ­Ca2+ in the cell medium. The absence 
of extracellular ­Ca2+ determined levels of ROS similar to 
those observed in untreated cells up to 180 min of treatment

with the oligomers, without any initial increase at early time 
points (Fig. 8c,d), indicating that the cells without any ­Ca2+ 
influx and dyshomeostasis did not undergo any oxidative 
stress, despite the treatment with toxic Aβ42 ADDLs in the 
absence of antioxidants (Fig. 8c,d). These results emphasise 
that while the suppression of the ­Ca2+ influx in the cells 
suppresses the oxidative stress for the entire length of time 
of the analysis, the cellular protection by a reducing agent 
does not suppress the initial oligomer-induced ­Ca2+ influx.
To confirm these results with different probes of intra-
cellular ­Ca2+ and ROS, we repeated the experiments with 
ADDLs after 10 and 60 min of treatment, with or without 
Trolox and with or without ­Ca2+ in the cell medium, using 
the X-Rhod-1 AM and the CellRoxTM Deep Red Reagent to 
monitor ­Ca2+ and ROS levels, respectively. The results con-
firm that the presence of the antioxidant allowed the cells to 
react to and normalise the initial ­Ca2+ influx observed after 
10 min of treatment, which reached the levels of untreated 
cells after 60 min of treatment (Fig. S3a,b), and that ROS 
levels remained constant and similar to those of untreated 
cells when the treatment was performed in a medium with-
out ­Ca2+ (Fig. S3c,d).
The effect of Trolox was also tested on primary rat corti-
cal neurons. The cells were treated with Aβ42 ADDLs for 
10 or 60 min, with or without the 1 h pre-treatment with 
Trolox. Similarly to SH-SY5Y cells, the presence of Trolox 
did not prevent a slight increase of the intracellular ­Ca2+ 
concentration, but caused lower levels of ­Ca2+ after both 10 
and 60 min of treatment with Aβ42 ADDLs relative to cells 
pre-treated with Trolox (Fig. 9). This suggests that also in 
this cellular system the oxidative stress reduction allows the 
cells to counteract the initial ­Ca2+ influx across the mem-
brane and restore the normal levels of ­Ca2+.
Discussion
Dysregulation of ­Ca2+ signalling and excessive production 
of intracellular ROS are common early features of neurode-
generative disorders, in particular AD [13, 15, 47, 48]. Sev-
eral studies have shown that the passage from the extracel-
lular space into the cytosol of small molecules and ions, such 
as ­Ca2+ ions, is mediated by the interaction of Aβ oligom-
ers, characteristic of AD, with the lipid bilayer [7, 11, 14, 
17, 18]. Our results confirm these observations. They also 
confirm that this early modification is associated with the 
increase of cytosolic ROS levels. Interestingly, the increase 
of ROS production appears to occur more rapidly following 
the treatment with Aβ42 ADDLs than HypF-N OAs, which 
can be attributed to the known oxidative potential of Aβ42 
ADDLs through ­Ca2+-independent mechanisms [44–46].
The maintenance of the ­Ca2+ gradient across the cell 
membrane, where the ­Ca2+ concentration is 50–100 nM 
inside the cell and 1.1 mM outside, represents a great ener-
getic expense, because the plasma membrane ­Ca2+-ATPase 
(PMCA) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ­Ca2+-ATPase 
(SERCA) need ATP to pump out the ions from the cyto-
sol and restore homeostasis [6, 28, 36, 37]. Therefore, the 
increased need for ATP caused by the oligomer-induced 
­Ca2+ dyshomeostasis activates the Krebs cycle, electron 
transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochon-
dria, which determines the mitochondrial generation of ROS 
through the increased ­O2 reduction [28, 37]. ROS can also be 
produced by extramitochondrial enzymes, such as NADPH 
oxidase, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, myeloperoxi-
dase, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and uncoupled nitric 
oxide synthase, all of which are modulated by ­Ca2+ [37]. 
This explains the association between ­Ca2+ dysregulation 
and increased ROS production.
The kinetic results presented here show that the delay in 
ROS production, which is evident as a lag phase and slower 
overall process in both time courses of ROS production fol-
lowing Aβ42 ADDLs and HypF-N OAs addition, is sugges-
tive, albeit not a demonstration per se, that the ROS increase 
follows, and is caused by, that in ­Ca2+. To address further the 
cause-and-effect relationship between these two events, we 
took into consideration the data obtained with inhibitors of 
the ­Ca2+ influx and the known relationship between the two 
processes. Indeed, the extracellular-to-cytosol influx of ­Ca2+ 
induced by misfolded protein oligomers arises, at least in its 
early stages, from the passage of the ions through the AMPA 
and NMDA receptors [9, 15, 18, 19], which are mechanically 
activated following the modification of the phospholipid

bilayer induced by the oligomers [14]. The pharmaco-
logical inhibition of the two glutamatergic receptors, with 
CNQX and memantine, respectively, delayed transiently the 
­Ca2+ influx induced by these oligomers, with no significant 
increase within the first minutes of treatment. The delay 
mediated by CNQX and memantine, however, did not only 
involve the ­Ca2+ influx, but also ROS production. We also 
observed a delay in ROS levels increase following the pre-
treatment with the inhibitors and this delay was even larger 
than that observed for ­Ca2+ levels. These results suggest that 
the inhibition of AMPA and NMDA receptors, with the con-
sequent reduction of the early ­Ca2+ influx, allowed the cells 
to postpone ROS production. At later time points, intracel-
lular ­Ca2+ levels increase despite the persistent inactivation 
of the two receptors, reaching the same levels observed in 
the absence of any inhibition, because it is caused by the 
direct passage of the ions through the cell membrane after 
the interaction of the oligomers with the lipid bilayer and a 
consequent destabilization and perforation [17, 18]. In addi-
tion, the ­Ca2+ pumps are inhibited by ROS, contributing 
to increase ­Ca2+ levels at later time points (see below). In 
the same way, ROS production increases, while continuing 
to maintain this slight delay because of the inactivation of 
the AMPA/NMDA receptors. The kinetic data, in particu-
lar, indicate that the use of either CNQX or memantine, or 
both, results in a lag time of the increase in ­Ca2+ levels, fol-
lowed by the extension of the lag phase in ROS production. 
Other ­Ca2+ channels are probably involved in the oligomer-
mediated ­Ca2+ influx, such as TRPM2 [23], VDCCs [24] 
and TRPA1 [25], but these have not been found previously 
to be involved significantly in our system [14]. The delay 
caused by CNQX and Memantine on ­Ca2+ and ROS kinetics 
was lower on cells treated with Aβ42 ADDLs, compared to 
cells treated with HypF-N OAs, probably because the dam-
aging action of the first type of oligomer on the membrane 
is stronger, and, after its interaction with the lipid belayer 
and the consequent destabilization and perforation, the direct 
passage of the ions through the cell membrane is more pro-
nounced compared to that of HypF-N OAs.
In AD brains, high levels of intracellular ROS were found 
to react with several macromolecules, such as proteins, poly-
saccharides, nucleic acids and lipids, causing their oxidation 
and leading to the production of reactive ketone/aldehyde 
moieties and other carbonyl derivatives [48]. An important 
deleterious effect of ROS in the brain is lipid peroxida-
tion, which directly damages biological membranes [44, 
49]. Moreover, high levels of ROS cause the oxidation of 
multiple methionine residues of the ­Ca2+ signalling protein 
calmodulin (CaM), with its consequent inability to activate

its target proteins, including the PMCA, which is important 
for the maintenance of ­Ca2+ homeostasis [36, 50, 51]. High 
levels of ROS also result in tyrosine and cysteine oxidation 
of the SERCA [52–54]. Indeed, upon treatment with the 
antioxidant agent Trolox in our experiments, which com-
pletely inhibits the increase of ROS levels and prevents its 
damaging effects, it is likely that the cells are able to restore 
­Ca2+ homeostasis effectively, as a result of the lack of ROS-
mediated oxidation of the PMCA and SERCA, among other 
cellular factors.
The selective oxidation and inactivation of the ­Ca2+ regu-
latory proteins mediated by ROS may represent an adaptive 
response to the oxidative stress, because it down-regulates 
ATP production through the mitochondrial electron transport 
chain and the inevitable generation of ROS associated with 
it [28].
Further evidence of the importance of ­Ca2+ influx in ROS 
production occurs in the treatment with the oligomers in a 
medium without ­Ca2+ (to inhibit ­Ca2+ influx) and with an 
antioxidant agent (to inhibit ROS production). The absence of 
­Ca2+ in the extracellular medium fully inhibits the increase of

the intracellular ­Ca2+ levels that normally flow from the extra-
cellular space, but at the same time fully inhibits ROS produc-
tion, confirming that ROS result from the need to restore ­Ca2+ 
homeostasis. By contrast, treatment with the antioxidant agent 
Trolox leads the restoration of ­Ca2+ homeostasis, but only at 
prolonged time points. This latter analysis showed that ­Ca2+ 
ions enter the cells in the first minutes, because the antioxidant 
agent inhibits only ROS production and is not able to inhibit 
the oligomer-mediated activation of AMPA and NMDA recep-
tors that occurs within the first minutes of interaction of the 
oligomers with the cell membrane. This rapid increase of 
intracellular ­Ca2+ is followed by a decrease, suggesting that 
the cells are able to pump out ­Ca2+ and restore homeostasis as 
they benefit from an effective antioxidant capacity induced by 
Trolox and absence of any direct ROS-induced inhibition of 
the PMCA, SERCA, other pumps and possibly other cellular 
factors involved in these processes.
Conclusions
Vicious cycles, or positive feedback loops, exist between 
­Ca2+ signalling and ROS production [28, 37], and even 
between Aβ production and ­Ca2+ signalling [55] and 
between Aβ production and ROS production [55], where the 
various events sustain each other. However, a precise cause-
and-effect relationship between increased levels of intracel-
lular ­Ca2+ and cytosolic ROS production at the very early 
stages of the overall dysregulation induced by misfolded 
protein oligomers emerges from our results by three distinct 
lines of evidence, namely: (i) a lag time observed in the 
time course of oligomer-induced ROS production (but not 
in ­Ca2+ increase), (ii) an ability of AMPA/NMDA receptor 
inhibitors to retard ROS production even more effectively 
than ­Ca2+ influx and (iii) an inability of antioxidant agents 
to inhibit the early ­Ca2+ influx, while fully maintaining the 
redox status of the cells, whereas a ­Ca2+ deprived medium 
inhibits fully and effectively both ­Ca2+ influx and ROS pro-
duction. Hence, the oligomers cause the entry of ­Ca2+ ions 
in the cells, determining the formation of ROS due to the 
increased demand of ROS-generating ATP production by 
mitochondria; ROS in turn prevent the cells from pump-
ing back ­Ca2+ ions into the extracellular space and from 
restoring the normal ­Ca2+ homeostasis, indicating a positive 
feedback on ­Ca2+ dyshomeostasis on the longer time scale.
