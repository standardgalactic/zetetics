The projected states are composed of two sub-
lattice components in the emitter and collector.
As a result, momentum-dependent constructive
(φe(c) = 0) or destructive (φe(c) = p) interference
between sublattice components is governed by
jyA þ yBj2º1 þ cosφe(c), for the states both in
emitter (φe) and collector (φc) and manifests itself
in the tunneling characteristics I(Vb). Because the
magnetic field selects the pairs of particular plane
wave states probed by tunneling at a particular
gate or bias voltage (Fig. 4, A and B), the measured
asymmetry provides a direct visualization of the
pseudospin polarization of the Dirac fermions.
In the presence of the magnetic field, each res-
onance peak represents tunneling from a par-
ticular corner of the BZ. This allows one to inject
electrons with a particular valley polarization, and
from a selected corner of the BZ. We use the ex-
perimental parameters to calculate the amount
of polarization achieved in our experiment (Fig.
3, J and M), and estimate that the valley polar-
ization, P ¼ ðIK −IK′Þ=ðIK þ IK′Þ [where IK(IK′)
is the current injected into the K(K′) valley] can
beashighas30%(40%)fortheparticularGr/3hBN/
Gr (Gr/5hBN/BGr) devices. The main limit to the
degree of polarization is the energy broadening of
states at the Fermi levels caused by inelastic tun-
neling processes. However, even for the current
level of disorder, with the resonances at around
Vb ≈0 V (e.g., resonances marked by yellow dashed
lines on Fig. 2D at Vg > 50 V), which maximizes the
number of states participating in tunneling and
sensitive to magnetic field, a polarization close to
75% could be achieved (19). By using devices with
smaller misalignment between the graphene elec-
trodes [on the order of 0.2°, now within the reach
of the current technology (19)], valley polarization
close to 100% is possible (19).
The same mechanism can also be used to se-
lect electrons with a particular pseudospin polar-
ization. In Fig. 4, C to R, we present results of a
calculation of the contribution of different elec-
tronic states in k-space to the tunnel current for
the Gr/3hBN/Gr (Fig. 4, C to I) and Gr/5hBN/
BGr (Fig. 4, J to R) devices. We choose the posi-
tion of the Fermi levels in the emitter and col-
lector to be very close to a resonance at B = 0 T.
Then, for certain directions of B, the resonant
conditions are achieved only in one valley and
for only a very narrow distribution in k-space
(Fig. 4, G to I). Tunneling of the electrons from
other parts of k-space is prohibited either because
they are off-resonance or because of the pseudo-
spin selection rule. Alternatively, for the Gr/5hBN/
BGr device and exploiting the difference in cur-
vature of monolayer and bilayer electronic bands,
we can choose the overlap between the bands in
such a way that the magnetic field reduces the
overlap in one valley and increases it for the
other (Fig. 4, M to R). In this case, momentum
conservation at B = 0 T is fulfilled for the
states marked by white dashed lines (Fig. 4O).
However, only one of those lines contributes
to tunneling, owing to pseudospin interference
(Fig. 4, M and N).
Our technique, which enables tunneling of valley-
polarized electrons in monolayer and bilayer gra-
phene, also allows one to selectively inject carriers
propagating in the same direction and to probe
pseudospin-polarized quasi-particles. In principle,
the technique can be extended to tunneling de-
vices in which surface states of topological insu-
lators are used as electrodes; then, all-electrical
injection of spin-polarized current (28) with non-
invasive tunneling contacts could reveal a number
of exciting phenomena (29–31).

China’s historiographical traditions tell of the successful control of a Great Flood leading to
the establishment of the Xia dynasty and the beginning of civilization. However, the
historicity of the flood and Xia remain controversial. Here, we reconstruct an earthquake-
induced landslide dam outburst flood on the Yellow River about 1920 BCE that ranks as one
of the largest freshwater floods of the Holocene and could account for the Great Flood.
This would place the beginning of Xia at ~1900 BCE, several centuries later than
traditionally thought. This date coincides with the major transition from the Neolithic to
Bronze Age in the Yellow River valley and supports hypotheses that the primary state-level
society of the Erlitou culture is an archaeological manifestation of the Xia dynasty.
C
hina’s earliest historiographies, includ-
ing Shujing (Book of Documents) and
Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian,
by Sima Qian), tell of the Great Flood, a
lengthy, devastating flood of the Yellow
River. The culture hero Yu eventually tamed
this flood by dredging, earning him the divine
mandate to establish the Xia dynasty, the first in
Chinese history, and marking the beginning of
Chinese civilization. Because these accounts laid

the ideological foundations for the Confucian
rulership system, they had been taken as truth
for more than 2500 years until challenged by the
“Doubting Antiquity School” in the 1920s. Within
a decade, archaeological excavations demon-
strated the historicity of the second dynasty,
Shang, and the search for similar evidence for
Xia began (1, 2). Archaeological fieldwork since
the 1950s on the Early Bronze Age Erlitou culture
(~1900 to 1500 BCE) has led many scholars to
associate it with the Xia (1–6) because it overlaps
with the spatial and temporal framework of
the Xia dynasty. Traditionally, historians have
dated the start of Xia to ~2200 BCE, whereas
the government-sponsored Xia-Shang-Zhou Chro-
nology Project adopted the date as 2070 BCE
(5), leaving a chronological gap in associating
Erlitou with Xia (7–9). Other scholars see Xia pure-
ly as a myth fabricated to justify political succession
(10, 11).
Scholars also have long sought a scientific
explanation of the Great Flood (12–14), with
even Lyell mentioning it (15), yet no evidence
for it has been discovered. Here, we present
geological evidence for a catastrophic flood in
the early second millennium BCE and suggest
that it may be the basis of the Great Flood, there-
by lending support to the historicity of the Xia
dynasty. The evidence found in our investigations
along the Yellow River in Qinghai Province in-
cludes remains of a landslide dam, dammed lake
sediments (DLS) upstream, and outburst flood
sediments (OFS) downstream (Fig. 1 and figs. S1
to S5) that allow us to reconstruct the size of the
lake and flood (16).
Field observations (fig. S2B) show that the
ancient landslide dam deposits reach an ele-
vation of 240 m above present river level (arl)
and stretch for 1300 m (fig. S2A) along Jishi
Gorge (Figs. 1A and 3A). We estimate that the
saddle of the dam would have been 30 to 55 m
lower than the highest preserved remnants, so
the lake would have filled to an elevation of
185 to 210 arl [2000 to 2025 m above sea
level (asl)] (fig. S2B), impounding 12 to 17 km3
of water (16) (table S1). Based on typical river
discharge values, the dam would have com-
pletely blocked the Yellow River for 6 to 9 months
before overtopping (16). DLS distributed wide-
ly upstream of the dam are up to 30 m thick
and have a highest elevation of ~1890 m asl
(Fig. 1B and figs. S1 and S3A). We interpret
this as indicating that the catastrophic breach
dropped the water level 110 to 135 m (Fig. 1B),
releasing ~11.3 to 16 km3 of water (16) (table
S1), tens of times that estimated by a previous
study (17). After the breach, DLS infilled a resid-
ual lake behind the lowest part of the dam that
remained.
Outburst flood sediments are found down-
stream at elevations from 7 to 50 m arl in the
lower Jishi Gorge and in Guanting Basin (Fig.
1 and figs. S1 and S4). They are characterized by
high-concentration suspension deposition and
consist exclusively of angular clasts of green-
schist and purple-brown mudrock sourced from
Jishi Gorge (table S2). At the mouth of the gorge,
where the Yellow River enters Guanting Basin,
the sediments reach 20 m thickness and include
boulders up to 2 m in diameter (Fig. 1B and figs.
S1 and S4, C and D). We also identified the OFS at
the earthquake-destroyed prehistoric Lajia site (fig.
S5), a settlement of the Qijia culture (18, 19) known
for its early noodle remains (20), 25 km down-
stream from the dam. OFS at Lajia covered the
settlement’s last Qijia culture occupation and
filled in collapsed cave dwellings (fig. S5, A and
B), pottery vessels (fig. S5B), and earthquake fis-
sures (fig. S5C), mixing with pottery sherds (fig.
S5D) and other Qijia cultural materials, with
heights of up to 38 m arl.
Stratigraphic relationships of the OFS, rem-
nant dam, DLS, loess, and other deposits in
Jishi Gorge and neighboring basins, along with
destruction features at the Lajia site (fig. S1),
allow us to reconstruct and date a sequence of
events ending in the outburst flood. First, they
show that the damming and outburst flood event
occurred during the archaeological Qijia cul-
ture period (~2300 to 1500 BCE) after the
collapse of the Lajia cave-houses. Ground fis-
sures caused by the earthquake at the Lajia site
were entirely filled with OFS (fig. S5C) before
silts from surface runoff during the annual rains
could enter them, indicating that the outbreak
flood must have occurred less than 1 year after
the earthquake and collapse of the houses. It is
likely that the same earthquake that destroyed
Lajia also triggered the landslide that dammed
the river, along with widespread contempora-
neous rock avalanches whose deposits lay directly
beneath the DLS (fig. S3A).

To date the outburst flood, we collected car-
bon samples for accelerator mass spectrome-
try (AMS) 14C dating (16). Seventeen charcoal
samples from the OFS and the only charcoal
sample from a layer overlying the OFS (fig. S1)
indicate that the age for the flood is between
2129 and 1770 cal. BCE [95% confidence in-
terval (CI)] (Fig. 2A and table S5) (16). Char-
coal samples from DLS upstream of the dam
(fig. S1) yield calibrated 14C results (95% CI)
spanning 2020 to 1506 BCE (Fig. 2A and table
S5), demonstrating that the DLS is coeval with
or younger than the outburst flood and con-
firming that it is fill from the remnant lake.
The best dating for the flood comes from the
Lajia site (16), because it was destroyed within
1 year before the outburst flood. Radiocar-
bon determinations of bone samples from three
human victims, aged 6 to 13 years old, in col-
lapsed Lajia dwellings (Fig. 2B) agree to within
uncertainty (Fig. 2A and table S5), consistent
with that of two victims reported previously (21)
as well. Because the radiocarbon calibration curve
is linear in this region and the bones are the
same age, we use the inverse variance weighted
mean of the three measurements. This yields a
calibrated age with a median of 1922 ± 28 BCE
(1 SD) and a 95% CI of 1976 to 1882 BCE (Fig.
2C). To simplify this range, we use 1920 BCE to
indicate the approximate date of the flood.
We estimate the peak discharge of the flood
in two ways. Empirical formulas considering
the volume of the lake and the height of the
dam lead to estimates ranging from 0.08 to
0.51 × 106 m3s−1, with large uncertainties (16)
(table S3). We also reconstruct the flood channel
cross section from detailed surveys in Guanting
Basin and use Manning’s equation to estimate
a peak discharge of 0.36 to 0.48 × 106 m3s−1 (16)
(fig. S6 and table S4), consistent with the dam
break estimations (16) (table S3). The calculated
peak discharge of ~0.4 × 106 m3s−1 is more than
500 times the average discharge of the Yellow
River at Jishi Gorge. This ranks globally among
the largest freshwater floods of the Holocene (22).
We do not explicitly model the inundation
and effect of this outburst flood in the lower
reaches of the river, but analogous events dem-
onstrate that outburst floods from landslide
dams can propagate long distances. In 1967, an
outburst flood with a volume of just ~0.64 km3
propagated at least 1000 km along the Yalong-
Yangtze Rivers (23), so the Jishi prehistoric
outburst flood, with a volume of ~11 to 16 km3,
could have easily travelled more than 2000 km
downstream. The Jishi flood would have breached
the natural levees of the Yellow River, result-
ing in rare, extensive flooding. It is possible
that this outburst flood was also the cause of a
major avulsion of the lower Yellow River (Fig.
3A) inferred from archaeological data, with a
previously estimated date of ~2000 BCE (24, 25).
Widespread destruction of levees and depo-
sition of tributary mouth bars may have de-
stabilized the main river channel, leading to
repeated flooding until a new river channel
was established. Extensive flooding on the low-
er Yellow River plain would have had a great
effect on societies there. We argue that this
event and its aftermath likely would have sur-
vived in the collective memories of these so-
cieties for generations, eventually becoming
formalized in the received accounts of the
Great Flood in the first millennium BCE. In
fact, early texts such as the Shujing and Shiji
even record that a place called Jishi (the same
characters as the gorge where the outburst flood
began) was where Yu began his dredging of the
Yellow River; whether this is a coincidence will
require further historical geographical research.
The ~1920 BCE flood shares the main char-
acteristics of the Great Flood described in an-
cient texts. Apart from its huge peak discharge,
the secondary flooding on the lower plains may
have been long-lasting, just as the Great Flood
remained uncontrolled for 22 years until it
was managed by dredging (rather than by
blocking breaches in natural levees). There
is also the issue of whether the Great Flood
could have been caused by exceptional me-
teorological flooding, but a speleothem record
shows a generally weakened Asian summer mon-
soon from 8000 to 500 years before the present
(26), and proxies from lake and loess records also
indicate that a cool, dry climate regime begins
2000 BCE along the lower Yellow River (27), so
this would be unlikely. Furthermore, the early
textual records make no mention of frequent,
extreme storms related to the Great Flood.
The discovery and reconstruction here of
the massive outburst flood originating in Jishi
Gorge provide scientific support that the an-
cient Chinese textual accounts of the Great
Flood may well be rooted in a historic natural
event. They also shed light on the potential

historicity of the Xia dynasty itself, as Yu’s
founding of the dynasty is directly tied to his
achievements in controlling the Great Flood.
According to the Shiji, Yu’s father labored
unsuccessfully for 9 years to tame the flood
before Yu took over for 13 more years. Yu’s
success led to his mandate to become found-
ing king of the Xia 22 years after the flood
started. If the Jishi Gorge outburst flood of
~1920 BCE is the natural cataclysm that came
to be known as the Great Flood, then we can
propose a new beginning date for the Xia dy-
nasty, ~1900 BCE. This date, some 2 to 3 cen-
turies later than previous reckonings (1, 2, 5),
is compatible with the 1914 BCE date proposed
by Nivison based on astro-historiographical
evidence (28). This 1900 BCE date for the found-
ing of the Xia coincides with the beginning
of the Erlitou culture (6), so this finding also
supports the arguments that the Erlitou cul-
ture is the archaeological manifestation of
the Xia and that the Erlitou site was a Xia
dynastic capital (1–3). This outburst flood is
also coincident with the major sociopolitical
transition from Neolithic to Bronze Age in
the Yellow River valley (2, 6, 29) (Fig. 3, A and
B), suggesting that the concurrence of these
major natural and sociopolitical events known
through the geological, historiographical, and
archaeological records may not simply be co-
incidence but rather an illustration of a pro-
found and complicated cultural response to an
extreme natural disaster that connected many
groups living along the Yellow River.
