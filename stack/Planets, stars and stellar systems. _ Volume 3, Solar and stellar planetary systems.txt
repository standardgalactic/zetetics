Series Preface
It is my great pleasure to introduce “Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems” (PSSS). As a “Springer
Reference”, PSSS is intended for graduate students to professionals in astronomy, astrophysics
and planetary science, but it will also be useful to scientists in other fields whose research inter-
ests overlap with astronomy. Our aim is to capture the spirit of 21st century astronomy – an
empirical physical science whose almost explosive progress is enabled by new instrumentation,
observational discoveries, guided by theory and simulation.
Each volume, edited by internationally recognized expert(s), introduces the reader to a
well-defined area within astronomy and can be used as a text or recommended reading for
an advanced undergraduate or postgraduate course. Volume 1, edited by Ian McLean, is an
essential primer on the tools of an astronomer, i.e., the telescopes, instrumentation and detec-
tors used to query the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Volume 2, edited by Howard Bond, is a
compendium of the techniques and analysis methods that enable the interpretation of data col-
lected with these tools. Volume 3, co-edited by Linda French and Paul Kalas, provides a crash
course in the rapidly converging fields of stellar, solar system and extrasolar planetary science.
Volume 4, edited by Martin Barstow, is one of the most complete references on stellar structure
and evolution available today. Volume 5, edited by Gerard Gilmore, bridges the gap between
our understanding of stellar systems and populations seen in great detail within the Galaxy
and those seen in distant galaxies. Volume 6, edited by Bill Keel, nicely captures our current
understanding of the origin and evolution of local galaxies to the large scale structure of the
universe.
The chapters have been written by practicing professionals within the appropriate sub-
disciplines. Available in both traditional paper and electronic form, they include extensive
bibliographicand hyperlink references tothe current literature that will helpreaders toacquire a
solid historical and technical foundation in that area. Each can also serve as a valuable reference
for a course or refresher for practicing professional astronomers. Those familiar with the “Stars
and Stellar Systems” series from several decades ago will recognize some of the inspiration for
the approach we have taken.
Very many people have contributed to this project. I would like to thank Harry Blom and
Sonja Guerts (Sonja Japenga at the time) of Springer, who originally encouraged me to pur-
sue this project several years ago. Special thanks to our outstanding Springer editors Ramon
Khanna (Astronomy) and Lydia Mueller (Major Reference Works) and their hard-working edi-
torial team Jennifer Carlson, Elizabeth Ferrell, Jutta Jaeger-Hamers, Julia Koerting, and Tamara
Schineller. Their continuous enthusiasm, friendly prodding and unwavering support made this
series possible. Needless to say (but I’m saying it anyway), it was not an easy task shepherding
a project this big through to completion!
Most of all, it has been a privilege to work with each of the volume Editors listed above and
over 100 contributing authors on this project. I’ve learned a lot of astronomy from them, and I
hope you will, too!

Preface to Volume 3
Twenty years ago this volume could not have been written. For generations humans studied the
Solar System and theorized about its origin. Speculation about other planetary systems dates
back at least as far back as Democritus from antiquity, and Giordano Bruno and Galileo at the
dawn of modern scientific inquiry. The discovery of, and the surge of research on, exoplanets
in the last decade or so have shown that the Solar System in which we live is but one of thou-
sands, perhaps millions, of planetary systems in the Milky Way galaxy. The study of Solar System
bodies, both large and small, has enabled researchers to develop models of how planetary
systems form and evolve. Discoveries and investigations of extrasolar planets, in turn, have
helped improve understanding of how our own Solar System may have originated and evolved.
By combining solar system and extrasolar planet science into a single volume, the present
work advocates a perspective that the two disciplines are converging and can be viewed as a
single topic of study. Unfortunately, this merger makes the task of thoroughly covering the sub-
ject matter in a single volume impossible. Here the reader will find a diverse selection of material
related to the Solar System and extrasolar planetary systems. The opening chapter by Youdin
and Kenyon describes current paradigms for the formation of planetary systems, developed
from observations of nascent circumstellar disks of gas and dust and more mature planetary
systems. The chapter by Morbidelli then gives a model for the subsequent dynamical evolution
of the Solar System, aiming at answering the question, “Why is there such a great diversity in
the architectures of planetary systems?”
Of course, the Solar System continues to provide the most detailed data about planets.
Important groups of objects are discussed in subsequent chapters: terrestrial planets (Barlow),
Jovian planets (Chanover and Stevenson), asteroids and meteorites (Rivkin), and planetary
rings (Tiscareno). Planetary magnetospheres are addressed in the chapter by Bagenal. The
volume concludes with chapters describing direct observations of the two primary components
of exoplanetary systems: the dusty debris belts or disks that dominate the cumulative surface
area (Moro-Martin), and the exoplanets that comprise the majority of the mass in the system
(Wright and Gaudi).
Carl Sagan wrote, “In all the history of mankind, there will be only one generation which
will be the first to explore the solar system, one generation for which, in childhood, the plan-
ets are distant and indistinct discs moving through the night, and for which, in old age, the
planets are places, diverse new worlds in the course of exploration” (London lecture at Eugene,
Oregon, 1970). Less than a generation after those words were written, humanity has begun
discovering planets beyond the solar system we live in and investigating the nature and
evolution of planetary systems.
We owe the authors of these chapters a great deal for their dedicated scholarship and their
willingness to put so much effort into these contributions. Their community spirit, cooperation,
and patience are much appreciated.

Dr. Oswalt has been a member of the Florida Tech faculty since 1982 and was the first profes-
sional astronomer in the Department of Physics and Space Sciences. He serves on a number of
professional society and advisory committees each year. From 1998 to 2000, Dr. Oswalt served
as Program Director for Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics at the National Science Founda-
tion. After returning to Florida Tech in 2000, he served as Associate Dean for Research for the
College of Science (2000–2005) and interim Vice Provost for Research (2005–2006). He is now
Head of the Department of Physics & Space Sciences. Dr. Oswalt has written over 200 scientific
articles and has edited three astronomy books, in addition to serving as Editor-in-Chief for the
six-volume Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems series.
Dr. Oswalt is the founding chairman of the Southeast Association for Research in Astron-
omy (SARA), a consortium of ten southeastern universities that operates automated 1-meter
class telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile (see the website www.saraobservatory.org for details). These facilities,
which are remotely accessible on the Internet, are used for a variety of research projects by
faculty and students. They also support the SARA Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) program, which brings students from all over the U.S. each summer to participate one-
on-one with SARA faculty mentors in astronomical research projects. In addition, Dr. Oswalt
secured funding for the 0.8-meter Ortega telescope on the Florida Tech campus. It is the largest
research telescope in the State of Florida.
Dr. Oswalt’s primary research focuses on spectroscopic and photometric investigations of
verywide binaries that contain known orsuspected white dwarfstars. These pairs ofstars, whose
separations are so large that orbital motion is undetectable, provide a unique opportunity to
explore the low luminosity ends of both the white dwarf cooling track and the main sequence;
to test competing models of white dwarf spectral evolution; to determine the space motions,
masses, and luminosities for the largest single sample of white dwarfs known; and to set a lower
limit to the age and dark matter content of the Galactic disk.

From Disks to Planets 1

Introduction
Theories for the formation and evolution of planets depended primarily on geophysical data
from the solar system (see Brush 1990, and references therein). Starting in the 1940s, astro-
physical data began to provide new insights. Discoveries of pre-main-sequence stars in Taurus-
Auriga, Orion, and other regions led to the concept that stars form in giant clouds of gas and
dust (see Kenyon et al. 2008b, and references therein). Because nearly every young star has a
circumstellar disk with enough mass to make a planetary system, theorists began to connect the
birth of stars to the birth of planets. Still, the solar system remained unique until the 1990s, when
the first discoveries of exoplanets began to test the notion that planetary systems are common.
With thousands of (candidate) planetary systems known today, we are starting to have enough
examples to develop a complete theory for the origin of the Earth and other planets.
Here, we consider the physical processes that transform a protostellar disk into a plane-
tary system around a single star. Instead of discussing the astrophysical and geophysical data
in detail (e.g., Dauphas and Chaussidon 2011), we focus on a basic introduction to the physi-
cal steps involved in building a planet. To begin, we discuss several observational constraints
from the wealth of astrophysical and geophysical material in >Sect. 2. We then describe the
global physical properties and evolution of the disk in >Sect. 3. Aside from the special con-
ditions required for fragments in the disk to collapse directly into giant planets ( >Sect. 5.3),
most planets probably grow from micron-sized dust grains. Thus, we consider how a turbulent
sea of grains produces the building blocks of planets and planetesimals ( >Sect. 4) and how
ensembles of planetesimals collide and merge into planets which may later accrete a gaseous
atmosphere ( >Sect. 5). We conclude with a brief summary in >Sect. 6. >Table 1-1 defines
frequently used symbols for reference.

Observational Constraints on Planet Formation Theories
We begin with the main observational constraints on planet formation processes, including raw
materials, timescales, and outcomes. Detailed studies of the solar system and the disks around
the youngest stars yield strict limits on the mass available and the time required to make a
planetary system. The diverse population of exoplanets illustrate the many outcomes of planet
formation.
2.1 Lessons from the Solar System
Until the discovery of exoplanets, the solar system was the only known planetary system.
The solar system will continue to provide the most detailed data on planet formation, despite
obvious issues of statistical significance and anthropic bias.
2.1.1 The Solar Nebula
The alignment of major planets in the ecliptic plane suggests that they formed within a flat-
tened disk or “nebula.” The philosopher Immanuel Kant and the mathematician Pierre-Simon

4 1
From Disks to Planets
Laplace are often credited for this “nebular hypothesis.” However, the scientist and theologian
Emanuel Swedenborg first recorded this insight in his 1734 Principia. For a long time, the neb-
ular hypothesis competed with the theory, proposed by the naturalist Buffon, that planets were
tidally extracted from the Sun during an encounter. Though Laplace dismissed the encounter
theory as being inconsistent with the circular orbits of the planets, it survived to reach peak pop-
ularity in the early twentieth century as the Chamberlin-Moulton hypothesis (Jeffreys 1929).
Once Payne (1925) identified hydrogen as the most abundant element in stars, the nebular
hypothesis regained favor. Adding the tidal theory’s idea of planetesimals – small solid particles
that condense out of hot gas – the nebular hypothesis began to develop into a robust theory for
planet formation.
The minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) provides a simple estimate of the mass available
in planet-forming disks. The recipe for the MMSN is to distribute the mass currently in the solar
system’s planets into abutting annuli, adding volatile elements (mainly hydrogen gas) until the
composition is solar. Kuiper (1951) and Cameron (1962, see his Table 5) estimated the mass of
the MMSN as a few percent of a solar mass. Weidenschilling (1977b) and Hayashi (1981) fit the
now canonical R−/surface density law, bravely smoothing the mass deficits in the regions of
Mercury, Mars, and the asteroid belt and the abundance uncertainties for the giant planets. The
roughness of the fit is immaterial: the MMSN is not a precise initial condition but a convenient
fiducial for comparing disk models.
We use the same MMSN as Chiang and Youdin (2010) with disk surface density profiles:
Σg = , F ( R
AU)
−/
g cm−
(1.1)
Σp = F Zrel ( R
AU)
−/
g cm−,
(1.2)
where subscripts “g” and “p” respectively denote gas and particles (condensed solids) and R is
the distance from the Sun. The parameter F scales the total mass; F = is a reference MMSN.
Integrated out to AU, the MMSN disk mass is .M⊙.
The parameter Zrel scales the ratio of solids to gas, or disk metallicity, as
Zdisk = Σp/Σg = .Zrel ,
(1.3)
evolves during the planet formation process, as evidenced by the enrichment of heavy elements
relative to H in Jupiter and Saturn. Our fiducial value is normalized to the Lodders (2003)
analysis of (proto-)solar abundances, which can be approximately summarized as
Zrel ≃

.
K ≲T ≲,−,K

T ≳,−,K
.
(1.4)
The abundance of solids decreases with increasing temperature due to the sublimation of (most
significantly) methane ice above K, water ice above K, and dust over a range of tem-
peratures from roughly 1,300 to 2,000 K, covering the condensation temperatures for different
minerals. Note that this definition of disk metallicity ignores the heavy elements in the gas
phase, which are at least temporarily unavailable to produce planetary cores. For the disk tem-

In the solar system today, the temperatures of solids are set by an equilibrium between heat-
ing and cooling. Although gravitational contraction (Jupiter) and tidal heating (many satellites,
including the Moon) contribute some heating in a few objects, the Sun is the primary source
of heating. Radiation from the Sun peaks at a wavelength of λmax,⊙≈0.5 μm. Objects with
radius r, peak wavelength λmax,g < r, and no atmosphere radiate as nearly perfect blackbodies.

Coupled with the condensation temperatures in ( >1.4), these definitions allow us to iden-
tify the “snow line.” Also known as the “frost line,” this annulus in the disk1 separates an inner
region of rocky objects from an outer region of icy objects (Kennedy and Kenyon 2008). For
blackbody grains, the watercondensation temperatureof 180 K implies Rsnow ≈2.7 AU, roughly
coincident with the asteroid belt. Similarly, the methane condensation temperature of 40 K
yields another region beyond the outer edge of the Kuiper belt at 48 AU where solid objects
have a combination of water and methane ice. Inside of ∼0.1 AU, dust evaporates; rocky grains
cannot exist so close to the Sun.
2.1.2 Isotopic Timescales
Meteorites delivered to Earth from the asteroid belt provide the most detailed chronology of the
early solar system (e.g., Dauphas and Chaussidon 2011). Primitive meteorites from asteroids
that did not undergo differentiation (or other significant alteration) preserve the best record of
their formation. These primitive meteorites are called chondrites because they contain many
chondrules. Chondrules are glassy inclusions, with a typical size ∼.−mm. They provide
evidence for high-temperature melting events in the solar nebula. The nature of these melting
events is debated and beyond our scope (Connolly et al. 2006). Calcium-aluminum-inclusions
(CAIs) are also present in primitive meteorites. CAIs experienced even more extreme heating
than chondrules.

From Disks to Planets
With ages up to .± .Myr (Russell et al. 2006), CAIs are the oldest known objects
in the solar system. This age is consistent with current results for the main-sequence age of the
Sun (Bonanno et al. 2002). The absolute ages of CAIs are measured by lead-lead dating, which
makes use of half-lives, t/, of uranium isotopes that are conveniently long. The decay chain of
U →Pb has t/= .Gyr, while U →Pb has t/= .Gyr.
Radioisotopes with short half-lives yield accurate relative ages of meteorite components.
These isotopes are “extinct”; they have decayed completely to daughter products whose abun-
dances relative to other isotopes result in an age. The extinct isotope Al decays to Mg in
t/= .Myr. The abundance of Mg relative to Al and to Mg yields an age for the sample.
Aside from its use as a chronometer, Al is a powerful heat source in young protoplanets.
Both absolute (lead-lead) and relative (Al) ages support a planet formation timescale of
a few Myr. Most CAIs formed in a narrow window of −× year; chondrule formation
persisted for ∼4 Myr or longer. Russell et al. (2006) discuss systematic uncertainties. Here, we
emphasize the remarkable agreement of the few Myr formation time derived from primitive
meteorite analyses and protoplanetary disk observations ( >Sect. 2.2).
The assembly of terrestrial planets from planetesimals requires tens of millions of years.
Isotopic analysis of differentiated solar system bodies (including Earth, Mars, and meteorites)
probes this longer timescale. The decay of radioactive hafnium into tungsten, Hf →W with
t/= .Myr, datescore-mantle segregation. Tungsten is a siderophile (prefers associating with
metals), while hafnium is a lithophile (prefers the rocky mantle); thus, Hf-W isotope ratios are
the primary tool to date differentiation (See >Chap. 3 by Barlow). Studies of Hf-W systematics
indicate that asteroid accretion continued for ∼10 Myr, Mars’ core formed within 20 Myr, and
the Earth’s core grew over 30–100 Myr (Kleine et al. 2009). Astronomical observations of debris
disks ( >Sect. 2.2) and dynamical studies of terrestrial planet accretion ( >Sect. 5) support
these longer timescales.
2.1.3 Water
After hydrogen, water is the most abundant molecule in disks (e.g., Najita et al. 2007). Inside
the snow line, water exists in the gaseous phase, though it dissociates at T ≳2,500 K. As water
vapor interior to the ice line diffuses past the snow line, it condenses into icy grains. The snow
line thus acts as a cold trap, where the enhanced mass in water ice ( > 1.4) should accelerate
the growth of planetesimals and perhaps gas giant planets (Stevenson and Lunine 1988).
Water is abundant throughout the solar system (e.g., Rivkin et al. 2002; Jewitt et al. 2007,
and references therein). Outside of the Earth, water appears in spectra of comets, Kuiper belt
objects, and satellites ofgiant planets (including the Moon)and bound within minerals on Mars,
Europa, and some asteroids. Because they can be analyzed in great detail, meteorites from aster-
oids provide a wealth of information on water in the inner solar system. Many meteorites show
evidence for aqueous alteration prior to falling onto the Earth. Most groups of carbonaceous
chondrites and some type 3 ordinary chondrites contain hydrated minerals, suggesting associ-
ation with liquid water. Despite some evidence that grains might react with water prior to their
incorporation into larger solids, most analyses of the mineralogy suggest hydration on scales of
mm to cm within chondrites and other meteorites (Zolensky and McSween 1988).
The watercontent of solar systembodies helps trace the evolution of the snow line (Kennedy
and Kenyon 2008). Hydration within meteorite samples demonstrates that the snow line was

From Disks to Planets 1
7
at least as close as 2.5–3 AU during the formation of the asteroids (Rivkin et al. 2002). Radio-
metric analyses suggest hydration dates from 5 to 10 Myr after the formation of the Sun, close
to and perhaps slightly after the formation of chondrules. Ice on the Earth and on Mars sug-
gests the possibility that the snow line might have been as close as 1 AU to the proto-Sun, a real
possibility for passively irradiated disks ( >Sect. 3.4). Within the terrestrial zone, the rise in
water abundance from Venus (fairly dry) to Earth (wetter) to Mars and the asteroids (wetter
still) points to processes that either distributed water throughout the inner solar system (with a
preference for regions near the snow line) or inhibited accretion of water (either vapor or ice)
from the local environment. Abundance analyses, including D/H and noble gases, help to probe
the (still imperfectly known) history of water in the inner solar system.
2.2 Disks Surrounding the Youngest Stars
Observations of young stars provide additional constraints on the early evolution of planetary
systems. In nearby star-forming regions (Orion, Taurus, etc.), nearly every star with an age
of 1 Myr or less has an optically thick circumstellar disk (Williams and Cieza 2011). The disk
frequency seems independent of stellar mass. The data suggest the disks are geometrically thin,
with a vertical extent of roughly 10–20% of their outer radius. They are composed of molecular
gas and dust grains with sizes ranging from a few microns up to several mm. Around solar-type
stars, young disks have typical luminosities of order L⊙and radii of order 100 AU.
Estimating disk masses is challenging. Aside from a few transitions possible only in warm
material near the central star, His undetectable. The next most abundant molecule, CO, is
optically thick and provides a crude lower limit to the total mass. Current estimates rely on
a conversion from the dust emission at mm wavelengths to a dust mass and then to a mass
in gas. These estimates are highly uncertain due to ignorance of dust-to-gas ratios and grain
size distributions. The typical assumptions give disk masses ∼0.01 M⊙, a factor of 2–4 smaller
than the MMSN. The dispersion for ensembles of a few hundred systems is roughly an order of
magnitude (Andrews and Williams 2005; Williams and Cieza 2011). The size of the typical disk
is similar to the semimajor axes of orbits in the Kuiper belt.
Current data demonstrate that more massive young stars have more massive disks. Recent
observational programs concentrate on whether the ratio of disk mass to stellar mass is roughly
constant or increases with stellar mass. Despite the larger scatter in this ratio at every stellar
mass, the relation is probably linear (Williams and Cieza 2011).
High-resolution radio observations reveal interesting limits on the distributions of sur-
face density and temperature within the brightest and most massive disks around nearby stars.
Although disks with a broad range of surface density gradients are observed (Σ ∝R−n with
n ≈−0.6 to 1.5), most observations indicate a typical n ≈0.5–1.5 (Andrews and Williams 2005;
Isella et al. 2009; Williams and Cieza 2011). Thus, the surface density gradient in the MMSN is
steeper than the average protostellar disk but within the range observed in disks around other
young stars.
The evolution of protostellar disks sets severe limits on the timescale for planet forma-
tion. Optical and ultraviolet spectra of young stars show that material from the disk flows
onto the central star. The rate of this flow, the mass accretion rate, drops from well in excess
of −M⊙year−at 1 Myr to much less than −M⊙year−at 10 Myr (Williams and Cieza
2011). Declining mass accretion rates implies much less gas near the young star. At the
same time, the fraction of young stars with opaque dusty disks declines from nearly 100%

8 1
From Disks to Planets
to less than 1%. Fewer dusty disks imply that the solid material has been incorporated into
large (km-sized or larger) objects, accreted by the central star, or driven out of the system by
radiation pressure or a stellar wind. Direct constraints on the amount of gas left in 10-Myr-old
systems without opaque disks are limited to a few systems.
Among older stars with ages of 3–10 Myr, many disks have substantial mass beyond
30–50 AU but have inner holes apparently devoid of much gas or dust. The frequency of these
“transition” disks suggests that the evolution opaque disk →opaque disk with inner hole →no
opaque disk takes from 0.1–0.3 Myr up to 1–2 Myr (Currie and Sicilia-Aguilar 2011; Espaillat
et al. 2012).
Once the opaque disk disappears, many pre-main- and main-sequence stars remain sur-
rounded by 1–10-μm dust grains (Wyatt 2008). This material lies in a belt with radial extent
δR ≈.−.R and vertical height δz ≈.−.R, with R ≈1–100 AU. Infrared spectroscopy
suggests that the grains have compositions similar to material in the comets and the dust (zodi-
acal light) of the solar system. The total mass, a few lunar masses,exceeds the mass of dust in the
inner solar system by factors of 100–1,000. These properties are independent of stellar metal-
licity and many other properties of the central star. However, the frequency of and the amount
of dusty material in these dusty disks peak for stars with ages of 10–20 Myr and then decline
approximately inversely with time (Currie et al. 2008).
These disks place interesting limits on the reservoir of large objects around stars with ages
of 10–20 Myr. Among several possible grain removal mechanisms, the most likely are radiation
processes and collisions (Backman and Paresce 1993). Grains orbiting the star feel a headwind
from the incoming radiation from the central star, which causes the grain to spiral into the
star (Burns et al. 1979). If the grains have a mass density ρ●, the orbital decay time for this
Poynting-Robertson drag is

) (cR
L∗
) = ρ●( r
μm)( R


( L∗

)
−
year .
(1.8)
The decay time, tpr ∼1 Myr, is much shorter than the 100 Myr to 10 Gyr main-sequence life-
time of the central star. The large frequency of dusty disks among 50–500-Myr-(1–10 Gyr)-old
A-type (G-type) stars suggests the grains are continually replenished over the main-sequence
lifetime. By analogy with the solar system, where trails of dust result from collisions of aster-
oids (Nesvorný et al. 2003), high-velocity collisions among large (but undetectable) objects
can replenish the dust. Adopting typical sizes for asteroids, ∼1–10 km, a reservoir containing
∼10 M⊕of material can explain the amount of dust around young stars and the time evolution
of the dust emission among older stars. Because this mass is between the initial mass of solids
in protostellar disks (∼100–1,000 M⊕) and the dust mass in the solar system (≲−M⊕), these
systems are often called “debris disks” (Wyatt 2008, also See Chap. 9 by Moro-Martin).
2.3 The Exoplanet Revolution
The current pace of exoplanet discovery is extraordinarily rapid. Here, we highlight the main
insights exoplanets bring to theories of planet formation.
Within the discovery space accessible with current techniques, exoplanets fill nearly all
available phase space (e.g., Cumming et al. 2008; Gould et al. 2010; Howard et al. 2012; Johnson
et al. 2011, and references therein). Among ∼10–30% of middle-age solar-type stars, exoplan-
ets lie within a few stellar radii from the central star out to several AU. Because there are many

From Disks to Planets 1
9
multiplanet systems, the sample of short-period planets implies more planets than stars (Youdin
2011b). Though detection becomes more difficult, the frequency of exoplanets seems to grow
with increasing distance from the parent star. The orbits have a broad range of eccentricities,
with a peak at e ∼0.2. Planet masses range from a rough upper limit at 10–20 MJ to a few Earth
masses. Around stars with the same mass, lower mass planets are more frequent than higher
mass planets. More massive stars tend to have more massive planets.
There is some evidence that exoplanets are more likely around metal-rich stars (Gonzalez
1997; Johnson et al. 2010). With the large samples available, this “planet-metallicity correla-
tion” is now unambiguous for gas giants with masses ranging from the mass of Saturn up to
∼10 MJ. Among lower mass planets, small samples currently prevent identifying a clear corre-
lation. Larger samples with the Kepler satellite will yield a better test of the planet-metallicity
correlation as a function of planet mass.
The origin of any planet-metallicity correlation establishes some constraints on formation
theories. If the initial metallicity of the disk is identical to the current metallicity of the star, then
gas giants – and perhaps other planets – form more frequently in more metal-rich disks. How-
ever, planets could pollute the stellar atmosphere after the rest of the gaseous disk disperses,
raising the metallicity of the star above the initial metallicity of the disk. In this case, enhanced
metallicity would be a result, not a cause of planet formation. Current data contradicts the pol-
lution hypothesis (Fischer and Valenti 2005; Pasquini et al. 2007), but more study of the diverse
exoplanet population is warranted.
To quantify the planet-metallicity correlation, Johnson et al. (2010) fit the frequency, f , of
giant planets as a joint power law in stellar mass, M∗, and metallicity, ZFe ∝log([Fe/H]),
f ∝Mα
∗Zβ
Fe .
(1.9)
For giant planets in the California Planet Survey, α = .± .and β = .± .. Ignor-
ing the dependence with stellar mass (α ≡) introduces a bias but yields a stronger relation
with metallicity, (β = .± .). For more massive stars with M∗> .M⊙, α = .± .and
β = .±.. Thus, the formation of giant planets around more massive stars is more sensitive
to stellar mass and less sensitive to metallicity than for lower mass stars.
With exoplanet samples growing so rapidly, new analyses will change at least some of these
conclusions. The most firm conclusions – that exoplanetary systems are common and have
nearly as much diversity as possible – provide a good counterpoint to the wealth of detail
available from in situ analyses of the solar system.

Disk Properties and Evolution
Stars form within collapsing clouds of gas and dust. When a cloud collapses, most infalling
material has too much angular momentum to fall directly onto the nascent protostar. This gas
forms a rotationally supported circumstellar disk (Cassen and Moosman 1981; Terebey et al.
1984). If the angular momentum in the disk is transported radially outward, gas can accrete
onto the central star. Although jets launched near the protostar (Shu et al. 2000) or from the
disk (Pudritz et al. 2007) or both can remove significant angular momentum from the disk,
most analyses concentrate on how angular momentum flows through the disk.
At early times, the disk mass Mdisk is similar to the stellar mass M∗. For a circumstellar disk
with surface density Σ and radial flow velocity vR, the rate material flows through the disk as a

10 1
From Disks to Planets
function of radial coordinate R is
˙M = −πRvRΣ .
(1.10)
Positive ˙M corresponds to gas flowing toward, and eventually draining onto, the central star.
Ifthe mass infall rate from the surrounding molecularcloud ˙Mi exceeds ˙M, the disk mass grows.
If Mdisk exceeds ∼.M∗, gravitational instabilities within the disk can produce a binary com-
panion (Adams et al. 1989; Kratter et al. 2010a). Smaller instabilities may form brown dwarfs
or giant planets ( >Sect. 5.3). At late times, several processes – including the clearing action of
protostellar jets and winds (Shu et al. 1987) – stop infall. Without a source of new material, the
disk mass gradually declines with time.
In general, all of the physical variables characterizing the cloud and the disk change with
radius and time. However, ˙Mi, ˙M, and Σ often change slowly enough that it is useful to construct
steady disk models with a constant ˙M throughout the disk. Here, we developthe basic equations
governing the evolution of the disk and use steady disks to show the general features of all
circumstellar disks.
An evolving gaseous disk sets the physical conditions in which small particles grow into
planets. Physical conditions within the disk limit how planetesimals can form ( >Sect. 4) and
how solid planets grow out ofplanetesimals ( >Sect. 5.1.5). Once solid planets form, the gaseous
disk provides the mass reservoir for giant planet atmospheres ( >Sect. 5.2) and drives planet
migration (see See
>Chap. 2 by Morbidelli).
3.1 Basic Disk Dynamics
To introduce basic concepts in disk dynamics, we describe orbital motion in a gas disk and the
radial flow induced by viscosity. The orbital velocity of the gas vϕ is set by the balance of radial
forces – centrifugal, pressure, and gravitational2 – as
−
v
ϕ
R + ρ−∂P
∂R + GM∗
R
= ,
(1.11)
where ρ is the gas density and P is the gas pressure. Away from the immediate vicinity of pro-
toplanets, gravity from the central star typically dominates. Even a self-gravitating thin disk
has Mdisk ≪M∗. For P = P(R/R)−n (the index n need only be locally valid), the orbital
motion is
vϕ = vK (−nc

)
/
,
(1.12)
in terms of the Kepler velocity, vK =
√
GM∗/R, and the sound speed, cs =
√
γP/ρ, with γ the
adiabatic index. Plausible disk models have an outwardly decreasing pressure (n > ) almost
everywhere. Thus, pressure support typically gives sub-Keplerian rotation, but the correction
is quite small, vϕ −vK ∼−−vK. It is often safe to ignore the pressure correction to orbital
motions but not when studying the motion of solids relative to gas (Weidenschilling 1977a;
Youdin 2010, >Sect. 4.1.1).
Accretion disks also have radial inflow, which is constrained by the laws of mass, angular
momentum, and energy conservation. Indeed accretion disks can be considered as machines
2The radial speeds associated with accretion produce negligible advective accelerations, DvR/Dt ∼v
R/R.

lies inside annulus 2; material in annulus 1 orbits the star more rapidly than material in annulus 2
(Ω1 > Ω2)
that radiate energy as they transport mass inward and angular momentum outward. The viscous
disk model offers the simplest means to understand how a disk manages this feat. Consider a
thin ring with two adjacent annuli at distances Rand Rfrom a star with mass M∗(>Fig. 1-1).

If the gas has viscosity, the differential rotation, Ω−Ω< for R> R, produces a frictional
(shear) force that attempts to equalize the two angular velocities. The resulting torques pro-
duce an outward flow of angular momentum. By moving a small amount of disk material onto
distant, high-angular momentum orbits, large amount of mass can fall inward to low angular
momentum orbits. Mass accretion is biased toward inflow because specific (i.e., per unit mass)
angular momentum can increase to very large values but cannot fall below zero. The heat gener-
ated by viscous dissipation affects the disk temperature and the predicted spectra as described
in >Sect. 3.3.
For a disk with surface density Σ and viscosity ν, mass continuity and conservation of angu-
lar momentum lead to a nonlinear diffusion equation for Σ (e.g., Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974;
Pringle 1981),

∂R (R/∂

The first term on the right-hand side corresponds to viscous evolution; the second is a source
term which is positive for infall from the cloud ( ˙
Σext = ˙Σi) and negative for mass loss due to
photoevaporation, disk winds, or accretion onto giant planets. Consider a simple model with
ν = constant, ˙Σext = , and Σ(R, t = ) = mδ(R −R)/πR. That is, the initial mass m is in a

the mass to R = and all of the angular momentum to infinity. This evolution occurs on the
viscous timescale τ.
We now consider the evolution of disks with a more general viscosity law, ν = ν(R/R)β.
With a constant power law β, exact similarity solutions to ( > 1.13) exist (Lynden-Bell and
Pringle 1974). To develop intuition, we instead physically derive the approximate solution.
After several viscous timescales have passed, the disk “forgets” the initial conditions (as seen
in >Fig. 1-2). Conservation of angular momentum alone (without applying mass conservation
needed to derive ( > 1.13)) gives

The two terms in square brackets represent the advection of angular momentum and viscous
torques. For a steady disk with ∂Σ/∂t = , the term in square brackets must equal a constant
(independent of R). This constant represents the torque at the inner boundary, which can be
neglected far from that boundary (as we show explicitly in ( >1.26)). Thus, angular momentum
conservation gives

This physical derivation emphasizes the role of conservation laws in setting the global viscous
evolution of the disk. The results are consistent with similarity solutions derived using Green’s
functions (Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974).
3.2 Transport Mechanisms and the α Disk Model
The source of a physical mechanism to drive disk accretion is a long-standing problem. The
molecular viscosity, νmol = csλ – the product of sound speed, cs, and collisional mean free path,
λ – is far too small. For the MMSN, λ = μmHcs/ΩΣσH≈.R/cm, where μ = 2.4 is the mean
molecular weight, mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom, and σHis the collision cross section for
the dominant constituent of the gas, H. The resulting accretion timescale

vastly exceeds the age of the universe. Viable mechanisms for angular momentum transport
are sometimes identified as “anomalous” sources of viscosity. Because long-range interactions
are often important, the analogy between a transport mechanism and the local viscosity is
inexact. For sufficiently small-scale fluctuations, however, even self-gravitating disks are well
approximated by the viscous prescription (Lodato and Rice 2004).
Anomalous viscosity is most often associated with turbulence in the disk. Because the size
of turbulent eddies can greatly exceed λ, the effective turbulent viscosity can vastly exceed
the molecular one, even for slow, subsonic turbulence. However, turbulence by itself does not
explain accretion; velocity fluctuations must correlate for angular momentum to be transported
outward. Moreover, it is difficult (if not impossible) for Keplerian shear to drive turbulence; the
angular momentum gradient in disks is quite stable according to the Rayleigh criterion (Stone
and Balbus 1996).
Over the past 50 years, theorists have considered a wide range of transport mechanisms:
convective eddies, gravitational instabilities, internal shocks, magneticstresses, orbiting planets,
sound waves, spiral density waves, and tidal forces. Currently, the “magnetorotational instabil-
ity” (MRI) is the leading candidate for a transport mechanism in low-mass disks (Balbus and
Hawley 1991; Papaloizou and Nelson 2003). In this mechanism, modest magnetic fields thread
ionized material orbiting the central star. An outward (or inward) perturbation of fluid stretches
and shears the magnetic fields. The resulting torque amplifies the original perturbation and,
crucially, transports angular momentum outward. Although this mechanism is attractive, the

14 1
From Disks to Planets
low ionization fraction of protostellar disks restricts the MRI to surface layers of the disk at
many radii. Disks may then contain extensive “dead zones” (Gammie 1996), where levels of
transport and turbulence are reduced. In massive protostellar disks, gravitational waves and
gravitoturbulence are another likely source of angular momentum transport (Lin and Pringle
1987).
To sidestep fundamental uncertainties of transport mechanisms, it is convenient to adopt
a simple viscosity model (Shakura and Sunyaev 1973; Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974). Setting
ν = αcsH – where H = cs/Ω is the vertical scale height of the disk – leads to the popular
“α-disk” model. The dimensionless parameter α < (even ≪) since large values would lead to
rapid shock dissipation and/orgravitational fragmentation. Similartothe mixing length param-
eterization of convection, α-disk models allow progress despite ignorance of the underlying
dynamics. Detailed simulations typically quote measured transport rates in terms of effective α
values.
This definition allows us to define the three important timescales in a viscous disk (e.g.,
Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974; Pringle 1981). The shortest disk timescale is the dynamical
(orbital) timescale, td ∼Ω−:

(1.22)
The disk establishes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction on the same timescale
tv ≈H/cs ≈Ω−≈td.
The disk cooling time, tc ≈U/D, is the ratio of the thermal energy content (per unit area),
U = CvΣT, to the energy generation or dissipation rate, D. For a viscous disk, D = νΣΩ/
(Pringle 1981); Cv is the specific heat at constant volume. With CvT = (γ −)−P/ρ for an ideal
gas, the cooling time is
tc ≈

γ(γ −) α−Ω−.
(1.23)
In this classical result, the thermal timescale depends only on the local dynamical timescale,
the dimensionless viscosity (α), and the equation of state (γ). For a molecular gas, γ ≈7/5. The
cooling time is a factor of roughly α−larger than the dynamical time:

(1.24)
The viscous timescale – tν = R/ν – measures the rate matter diffuses through the disk.
Using our expressions for the sound speed and the viscosity, tν ≈(αΩ)−(R/H). Thus, the
viscous timescale is

Typically the disk is thin, H/R ≈0.03–0.1; thus, the viscous timescale is 100–1,000 times longer
than the cooling time.
The radial velocity in ( > 1.17) becomes vR ≈αcsH/R ≈.α(H/R)vϕ. With α < and
H/R < , vR is much smaller than both the orbital velocity and the sound speed.

3.3 Viscously Heated Disks
As shown above, tν ≫tc > td for α < 1, so the thermal properties of the disk adjust rapidly to
changes in the surface density distribution. This property is very useful in describing the ther-
mal properties of many astrophysical disks, including active galactic nuclei, interacting binaries,
and pre-main-sequence stars (Pringle 1981). We now describe the basic energetics of accretion
disks with constant ˙M.
Since gas remains on Keplerian orbits as it accretes, the specific energy release infalling from
R + dR to R is GM∗dR/(R), since half the potential energy goes into the increase in kinetic
energy. The energy release per unit area for a disk accreting at ˙M is FK(R) = G ˙MM∗/(πR).
This result is completely independent of how the energy was released.
The energy released by viscous dissipation does not simply matchthe local change in kinetic
energy. To fully describe the energetics of steady viscous disks, we must keep the integration
constant when integrating ( > 1.15) over radius to get
νΣ =

(1.26)
The integration constant, RJ, represents the torque ˙J exerted at the inner boundary, Rin as
˙J = ˙M√GM∗(√Rin −
√
RJ). The standard choice RJ = Rin is a zero-torque boundary con-
dition. Negative torques are not allowed for steady disks, as RJ > Rin would require νΣ < . For
RJ = , the maximum torque ˙Jmax = ˙M√GM∗Rin matches the flow of angular momentum past
the inner boundary.
The laws of fluid dynamics in cylindrical coordinates (Shu 1992) give the viscous dissipa-
tion as3

(1.27)
As advertised, this expression does not simply match the local release of Keplerian orbital
energy; far from the boundary (R ≫RJ), D(R) ≈FK(R). Viscous disks transport energy
(in addition to angular momentum) from the inner disk to the outer disk. Nevertheless, the
rapid falloff with R means that most energy is dissipated close to the disk’s inner edge.
Now consider the total energy release from large R to the inner boundary. The Keplerian
energy release is just LK = GM∗˙M/(Rin). The total viscous luminosity is

(1.28)
For the zero-torque boundary condition (RJ = Rin), the luminosity simply matches the release
of Keplerian energy. However, the disk’s luminosity increases due to work done by torques at
the inner edge, up to Ld = LK for RJ = . For typical parameters in protostellar disks

where fd ranges from 1 (no torque) to 3 (maximum torque).
3Note that Eq. 3.10 in Pringle (1981) has a factor of 2 typo in the intermediate result (involving ν) but reaches
the correct final result (in terms of ˙M).

16 1
From Disks to Planets
The maximum disk luminosity occurs for a disk that extends to the stellar surface, Rin = R∗.
The total accretion luminosity,
Lacc = f∗GM∗˙M
R∗
,
(1.30)
with ≲f∗≲, includes all the energy loss needed to come to rest on the rotating stellar
surface. For a star rotating at breakup, f∗≈. For a slowly rotating star, the damping of the
orbital kinetic energy gives twice the energy release f∗≈. Any difference Lacc −Ld ≥is
emitted at the stellar surface. This difference must be positive (accretion should not cool the
star), further constraining fd. As a consistency check, note that a disk with an inner boundary
at the surface of a star, Rin = R∗, that rotates at breakup must satisfy the zero-torque boundary
condition to avoid Lacc < Ld.
In many cases, the accreting star has a magnetosphere that truncates the disk at Rin > R∗
(e.g., Ghosh and Lamb 1979). Material then flows onto the star along magnetic field lines, col-
limated onto hot spots, which are hot because the accretion energy is emitted from a small
fraction of the stellar photosphere. In most young stars, Rin ≈3–5 R∗(e.g., Kenyon et al. 1996;
Bouvier et al. 2007). Thus, the hot-spot luminosity
Lhot = Lacc −Ld = Lacc (−fdR∗
f∗Rin
)
(1.31)
can easily reach 60–80% of the total accretion luminosity. For star that corotates with the disk’s
inner edge, fd ≈f∗≈is expected (Shu et al. 1994).
To calculate the temperature structure of viscously heated disks, note that the upper and
lower halves of the disk each radiates half of D(R). If the vertical optical depth τ > , the disk
photosphere then has effective temperature Te,
σT
e = GM∗˙M

⎛

(1.32)
Though Te is calculated as if the disk radiates as a blackbody, the disk’s atmosphere will radiate
as a stellar atmosphere with spectral lines, especially when Te ≳1,000–1,500 K. The effective
temperature declines as Te ∝R−/for R ≳a few R∗:

(1.33)
In a simple, gray-atmosphere approach, the midplane temperature Td is a factor of τ/larger
than Te and is used to derive the scale-height H, the viscosity ν, and other physical vari-
ables. More rigorous approaches calculate Te and Td using a self-consistent prescription for
the opacity throughout the disk.
The temperaturedistribution in ( >1.32) allows us to derive the surface density of an α disk.
Assuming the midplane temperature scales like the effective temperature (Td ≈Te ∝R−/),
ν ∝c
s Ω−∝r/for the α prescription. Then ( > 1.16) gives
Σ(R) = Σ( R

−/
(1.34)
where Σ, the surface density at 1 AU, depends on the mass accretion rate. Solving for the mid-
plane temperature with realistic opacities yields Σ ∝R−β with β ≈0.6–1 (e.g., Stepinski 1998;
Chambers 2009).

3.4 Steady Irradiated Disks
Although viscous dissipation drives the overall evolution, radiation from the central star also
heats the disk (Friedjung 1985; Adams and Shu 1986; Kenyon and Hartmann 1987). If the disk
is an infinite, but very thin, sheet, it absorbs roughly 25% of the light radiated by the central star.
For a 1-L⊙central star and disk accretion rates ˙M ≲−M⊙year−, emission from irradiation
exceeds emission from viscous dissipation ( > 1.29). If the disk reradiates this energy at the
local blackbody temperature, the radial temperature gradient of a flat, irradiated disk follows
the gradient for a viscous disk, Td ∝R−/(Friedjung 1985; Adams and Shu 1986).
Disks with vertical scale-height H absorb and reradiate even more starlight (Kenyon and
Hartmann 1987). Chiang and Goldreich (1997) derive a general formalism for H and Td in a
“passive” disk with negligible ˙M. Defining θ as the grazing angle that starlight hits the disk, the
temperature of a disk that emits as a blackbody is
Td ≈( θ

where T∗is the stellar temperature. The grazing angle is

(1.36)
where h is the height of the photosphere above the disk midplane. For a blackbody disk in
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, the grazing angle is the sum of a nearly flat component close
to the star and a flared component far from the star:

(1.38)
For ˙M ≈−M⊙year−, the irradiated disk is roughly twice as hot as a viscous accretion disk.
This temperature relation leads to a steeper surface density gradient in α disks. With
ν ∝c
s Ω−and c
s ∝Td, ν ∝r/. Using this viscosity in ( > 1.16),

(1.39)
where

(1.40)
The surface density gradient for an irradiated disk is steeper than the gradient for a viscous disk
and is reasonably close to the gradient for the MMSN.
For identical α, hotter irradiated disks have larger viscosity and smaller surface density than
cooler viscous disks. Integrating ( > 1.39) over radius, the mass of an irradiated disk is

3.5 Time Dependence
Deriving more robust estimates of disk evolution requires a direct solution of ( > 1.13). This
exercise requires a modelfor the viscosity and a prescription for the thermodynamics and opac-
ity of disk material. Analytic approaches assume a constant mass accretion rate through the
disk. If α and τ are simple functions of the local variables Σ and T, then the diffusion equa-
tion can be solved exactly for Σ(t), ˙M(t), and other disk properties (Stepinski 1998; Chambers
2009). Numerical approaches allow α and ˙M to vary with radius. Some solutions consider iter-
ative solutions to the temperature and vertical structure (e.g., Hueso and Guillot 2005); others
solve for the vertical structure directly using techniques developed for the atmospheres of stars
(e.g., Bell and Lin 1994; D’Alessio et al. 1998).
To compare these approaches, we consider a simple model for a viscous disk irradiated by a
central star. We assume that the optical depth of cool disk material is dominated by dust grains
with a constant opacity κ; warmer dust grains evaporate and have a smaller opacity:
κ =
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩
κ,
Td ≤Tevap
κ( Td
Tevap )
n
,
Td > Tevap
(1.42)
For material with roughly solar metallicity, typical values are κ≈2, Tevap ≈1,380 K, and
n = −(e.g., Chambers 2009). With this opacity, we derive a self-consistent disk tempera-
ture and scale height (as in Hueso and Guillot 2005) and solve for the time evolution of Σ using
an explicit solution to the diffusion equation (as in Bath and Pringle 1982).

(Σ ∝R−.; where viscous transport dominates). At late times, irradiation dominates the energy
budget; the surface density then falls more steeply with radius, Σ ∝R−.
Other approaches lead to similar time evolution in the surface density. Early on, a massive
disk is dominated by viscous heating. For these conditions, the simple analytic estimate of the
surface density yields Σ ∝R−n with n = /( >1.34), close to results for the numerical solution
(n = .) and other analytic and numerical (n = .−) approaches (Bath and Pringle 1982;
Lin and Pringle 1990; Stepinski 1998; Chambers 2009; Alexander and Armitage 2009). As the
disk ages, it evolves from a viscous-dominated to an irradiation-dominated system. Thus, the
exponent n in the surface density relation approaches the limit (n = /) derived in ( >1.39).
>Figure 1-4 compares the evolution of the disk mass and accretion rate at the inner edge
of the disk. In both solutions, the disk mass declines by a factor of roughly 2 in 0.1 Myr, a factor
of roughly 4 in 1 Myr, and a factor of roughly 10 in 10 Myr. Over the same period, the mass
accretion rate onto the central star declines by roughly four orders of magnitude.
3.6 Disk Instabilities and Fragmentation
In addition to evolution on the viscous timescale shown in > Fig. 1-3, all disks vary their
energy output on much shorter timescales. In compact binary systems, these fluctuations range
from small, 10–20%, amplitude flickering on the local dynamical timescale to large-scale erup-
tions, factors of 10–100, that can last for several times the local viscous timescale (Warner
1995). Although many pre-main-sequence stars also display distinctive brightness variations
(Joy 1945; Herbig 1962), the FU Ori variables provide the cleanest evidence for large-scale
variations of the disk, rather than the environment or the central star (Hartmann and Kenyon
1996).

20 1
From Disks to Planets
Theory suggests several types of instabilities in viscous disks (see Pringle 1981). In standard
derivations of the structure of steady disks, radiative cooling balances heating from viscous
stresses. However, radiative losses are set by local disk parameters; local parameters and an input
accretion rate set viscous energy generation. Usually radiative losses can keep up with changes
in disk structure; sometimes, radiation cannot balance viscous stresses, leading to a thermal
instability. A limit cycle arises, where regions of the disk alternate between states where radiative
losses exceed (and then fall below) the viscous energy input. This mechanism may produce FU
Ori and other eruptions in the disks of pre-main-sequence stars (Hartmann and Kenyon 1996).
Viscous instabilities occur when changes in the local surface density do not produce parallel
increases in the local mass transfer rate. From ( > 1.16), ˙M ∝νΣ. In a steady disk, ν is fairly
independent of Σ; thus, ˙M changes in step with Σ. For the MRI viscosity mechanism, however,
larger Σ leads to larger optical depths, less ionization, and smaller α. Thus, an MRI disk with
growing (falling) surface density can produce a smaller (larger) viscosity, leading to an ever
greater over- or underdensity in the surface density.
Although thermal and viscous instabilities change the temperature and surface density
throughout the disk, they evolve on timescales much longer than the local orbital period. Mas-
sive disks can evolve on shorter timescales. If the local gravity in a region with size λ overcomes
rotational support (GΣ ≳Ωλ) and thermal support (GΣ ≳c
s /λ), this region can (begin
to) collapse (Safronov 1960; Toomre 1964; Goldreich and Lynden-Bell 1965; Paczynski 1978).
Together, these conditions require c
s /(GΣ) ≲λ ≲GΣ/Ω. Collapse at any wavelength requires
the disk satisfy the “Toomre instability criterion,”
Q ≡csΩ
πGΣ ≲.
(1.43)
Setting the disk mass Md ≈ΣR, a stable disk has
cs ≳Md
M∗
vϕ .
(1.44)
When the disk first forms, Md ≈M∗. Such “disks” cannot be thin because H/R ∼cs/vϕ ≳.
In a viscous accretion disk, the stability criterion can be rewritten in terms of the accretion
rate (Gammie 2001). With ˙M = πνΣ and ν = αc
s Ω−, an unstable disk has ˙

(1.45)
with T in Kelvins. For the observed accretion rates in very young stars, ˙M ∼−M⊙year−,
unstable disks have αT/≲.. If α is large (−), only very cold disks are unstable (T ∼10–
15 K); smaller α (e.g., −) allows instability in warmer disks (T ∼50–60 K).

From Dust to Planetesimals
The accumulation of dust grains into planetesimals – solids greater than a kilometer in size – is
the first step in the formation of terrestrial planets and giant planet cores. Several observational
and theoretical reasons suggest that the formation of planetesimals is a separate step. Obser-
vationally, remnant planetesimals in the solar system and in extrasolar debris disks show that
growth sometimes stalls before planets accumulate all planetesimals. Comets from the Oort
cloud also suggest an intermediate stage between dust grains and planets (See
>Chap. 9 by
Moro-Martin).

From Disks to Planets 1
21
Theoretically, the physical processes responsible for the growth of planetesimals differ from
those relevant to the final stages of planet formation. As >Sect. 5 describes, few-body gravita-
tional encounters – both scattering and gravitationally focused collisions – establish the rates of
growth for icy and terrestrial planets. By contrast, the sticking of dust grains involves electro-
static forces. During planetesimal formation, particle dynamics is qualitatively different. Drag
forces exerted by the gas disk dominate the motions of small solids. Though not negligible, the
drag exerted on kilometer-sized or larger planetesimals is weaker than gravitational interactions
( >Sect. 5.2).
While planetesimal formation is a common occurrence in circumstellar disks, understand-
ing how it happens has proved elusive. Observations of planetesimal formation in action are
indirect. Particles beyond centimeter sizes contribute negligibly to images and spectra of cir-
cumstellar disks. Primitive meteorites record the conditions during planetesimal formation,
but the implications for formation mechanisms are difficult to interpret – we need a better
instruction manual.
Especially beyond millimeter sizes, experiments show that particle collisions often result in
bouncing or breaking instead of sticking (Blum and Wurm 2000; Zsom et al. 2010; Weidling
et al. 2012). Inefficient growth by coagulation is further complicated by the rapid infall of
centimeter- to meter-sized solids into the star. These difficulties – often termed the “meter-sized
barrier” – are explained in more detail in >Sect. 4.1.
Gravitational collapse is one way to overcome the growth barrier. The mutual gravitational
attraction of a collection of small solids could lead to a runaway collapse into planetesimals –
even when sticking is inefficient and radial drift is fast. While appealing, this path encounters
theoretical difficulties when stirring by turbulent gas is included. >Section 4.2 describes the
current status of the gravitational collapse hypothesis.
Even when self-gravity is weak, aerodynamic effects can concentrate solids in the disk. Par-
ticles tend to seek high-pressure regions in the disk. This tendency causes the inward drift
mentioned above. Particles can also concentrate in localized pressure maxima. Predicting the
sizes and lifetimes of pressure maxima is a difficult (and currently unsolved) problem of disk
meteorology.
In addition to the passive response of solids to the gas disk, active particle concentra-
tion occurs when particles cause their own clumping by altering the flow of gas. Instabil-
ities caused by gas drag, notably the streaming instability, provide a clumping mechanism
that is both powerful and amenable to study by direct numerical simulations. The strong
clumping driven by the streaming instability is capable of triggering gravitational collapse
into ∼100-km planetesimals. Both passive and active particle concentration mechanisms are
reviewed in >Sect. 4.3.
Theories based on complex nonlinear dynamics must be tested against, and refined
by, observations. We discuss observational consequences of planetesimal formation models
in > Sect. 4.4. Unless stated otherwise, the numerical estimates in the section use the pas-
sively heated MMSN disk ( >Sect. 3). For more detailed reviews of planetesimal formation, see
Chiang and Youdin (2010) and Youdin (2010). For a thorough review of collision experiments
and their relevance to planetesimal formation, see Blum and Wurm (2008).
4.1 The “Meter-Sized”Barrier
We discuss in more detail the two components of the “meter-sized” barrier to planetesimal
formation. The review of radial drift timescales in >Sect. 4.1.1 also serves as an introduction

22 1
From Disks to Planets
to the dynamics of solids in a gas disk. The discussion of collisional growth and destruction
in >Sect. 4.1.2 couples dynamical models of collision speeds to the complex physics of contact
mechanics.
4.1.1 Radial Drift and the Basics of Disk Aerodynamics
The aerodynamic migration of small solids imposes the most stringent timescale constraint on
planet formation: ≈100 years. Aerodynamic radial drift arises because solids encounter a head-
wind as they orbit through the gas disk ( > 1.12). This headwind removes angular momentum
from particle orbits, causing their inspiral. Infall speeds are fastest for solids near roughly meter
sizes. The critical size is actually below a meter in standard disk models – especially in their
outer regions. So the “meter-sized” barrier is a slight misnomer, but it has a better ring than the
“millimeter-to-tens-of-centimeters-sized” barrier.
Radial pressure gradients in gas disks set the speed of the headwind. Plausible disk models
are hotter and denser in the inner regions; on average, the radial pressure gradient is directed
outward. If the radial pressure gradient is directed inward, a tailwind – and outward particle
migration – results.
We express the headwind speed as the difference between the Keplerian velocity, vK =
√
GM∗/R = ΩR, and the orbital speed of the gas, vg,ϕ:

and drift speeds are faster.
To derive ( > 1.46), compute radial force balance assuming (correctly) that the radial
pressure acceleration, fP,R = −ρ−
g ∂P/∂R, is weak compared to the centrifugal accelera-
tion. Equivalently we can reproduce ( > 1.46) by balancing the pressure and Coriolis forces,
fP,R + fCor,R = with fCor,R = −ΩηvK.
Drag forces set the response of particle orbits to the gas headwind. We express the drag
acceleration felt by a solid particle as
f drag = −Δv/ts ,
(1.47)
where Δv is the particle velocity relative to the gas and ts is the aerodynamic damping timescale
for this relative particle motion.
The value of ts depends on particle properties – such as the internal density, ρ●, and spherical
radius, s – and on properties of the gas disk – ρg and cs – as

coupling of solids to the gas disk. The breaks in the curves are due to transitions between diﬀerent
drag laws, as described by ( >1.48). An internal density of ρ●= 1 gcm−3 is assumed for the solids

The dynamical significance of drag forces is measured by comparing the stopping time and

For τs ≪, particles are carried along with the gas; for τs ≫, gas drag is a small correction
to Keplerian orbits. >Figure 1-5 plots τs for a range of particle sizes in our passively heated
MMSN. At least in the inner disk, objects near meter sizes have τs ≈. In the outer disk, where
gas densities are lower, smaller solids have the critical τs = . As we now show, τs = solids have
the fastest radial drift speeds.

are much faster than disk lifetimes of a few Myr, especially near the “meter-sized”barrier

is a very strong constraint on growth. This constraint is the main element of the meter-sized
growth barrier. >Figure 1-6 plots the radial drift timescales for a range of particle sizes.

Large, τs ≫solids experience the full ηvK headwind, yet their radial drift is slow because their
inertia is so large. Small, τs ≪solids are dragged by the gas and only feel a mild headwind.
We thus see why radial drift is fastest near τs ≈. For these intermediate sizes, drag forces are
strong enough to overcome particle inertia but not so strong as to cause perfect coupling.
These idealized calculations explain the basics of radial drift. A pressing question is whether
ignored effects could mitigate the radial drift problem. The existence of a headwind is the most
crucial assumption, and it can vanish in localized pressure maxima as addressed below. Even
when these maxima exist, headwinds still prevail in the majority of the disk. We also assume

From Disks to Planets 1
25
that aerodynamic drag only affects the solids and not the gas component of the disk. When
the distributed mass density of solids ρp becomes comparable to the gas density ρg, then it is
no longer acceptable to ignore the feedback of drag forces on the gas. Nakagawa et al. (1986)
showed how drift speeds become slower when ρp ≳ρg. This feedback is also the source of
powerful drag instabilities – both shearing and streaming – that we address below. Thus, there
is no simple way to ignore the radial drift problem – its resolution has consequences for how
planetesimals form.
4.1.2 Early Collisional Growth
Planetesimal formation begins with the collisional agglomeration of dust grains into larger
solids, a process that is observed to proceed up to millimeter sizes in T Tauri disks (Williams
and Cieza 2011). The conceptually simplest mechanism to form planetesimals is for this colli-
sional growth to proceed past kilometer sizes. However, both direct experiment and theoretical
arguments show that coagulation beyond millimeter sizes is inefficient at best. This inefficiency
is particularly problematic due to the timescale constraints imposed by radial drift. The combi-
nation of inefficient sticking and rapid infall together comprises the formidable “meter-sized”
barrier.
Although collision rates do not rule out rapid growth, they place tight constraints on the
sticking efficiency To make this conclusion, we approximate the mean collision time as tcoll ∼
/(Ωτ), where τ ∼Σp/(ρ●s) is the vertical optical depth. This approximation for the collision
rate is good when τs ≫, and we show below that it suffices for τs = . The ratio of collision to
drift timescales for τs = solids is thus roughly

where we assume Epstein drag, appropriate for the outer disk. We use the result of hydrostatic
balance that Σg ∼ρgcs/Ω. When the collision time exceeds the drift time, collisional growth is
ruled out. Even when the two are close, growth requires an efficient rate of sticking per collision.
This constraint is most severe in the outer disk.
While turbulent motions increase collision speeds, they do not increase the collision rate
above the geometric estimate used to derive ( > 1.56). The reason is that turbulence also
increases the particle layer thickness, Hp, thereby decreasing the mean particle density, ρp. We
can compute the collision rate due to turbulence as t−
coll ∼nσv. Here the particle number density
is n ∼Σp/(Hpmp), where mp is the particle mass. The particle layer thickness due to turbulent
stirring is4

This well-known result (Cuzzi et al. 1993; Carballido et al. 2006; Youdin and Lithwick 2007)

cross section is σ ∼s, and the relative velocity due to turbulent motions is v ∼

(Markiewicz et al. 1991; Chiang and Youdin 2010). For τs > , the collision rate necessarily

agrees with the optical depth estimate. For τs < , the collision rate is also independent of the
strength of turbulence as t−
coll ∼ZΩ. These cases agree at τs ∼and confirm the constraint set
by ( > 1.56).
Collision rates are not the only concern. Collisions can also result in bouncing or fragmen-
tation that stalls, or even reverses, growth. Below speeds of ∼1 m s−, small dust grains stick
efficiently as a consequence of van der Waals interactions and the efficient dissipation of kinetic
energy (Chokshi et al. 1993; Blum and Wurm 2000). As particles grow and as collision speeds
increase, the collisional kinetic energy increases. Short-range sticking forces cannot match this
increase in kinetic energy, because they are surface area limited (Youdin 2004). Experimental
work confirms that collisions between equal-mass objects do not produce growth beyond ∼
millimeter sizes (Blum and Wurm 2008).
Collisions between lower mass projectiles and higher mass targets offer another route to
growth. In this scenario, impact speeds exceed the meters-per-second value expected to pro-
duce growth. As explained above, since small solids are tied to the gas flow, they impact larger
solids (which decouple from the gas) at the full headwind speed, ηvK ≳m s−. Indeed when
the latest experimental results are combined with dynamical estimates of collision speeds for a
dispersion of particle sizes, growth stalls at only millimeter sizes (Zsom et al. 2010).
Based on observed SEDs, disks likely find a way to overcome these obstacles and grow
solids beyond millimeter sizes (Williams and Cieza 2011). The mechanisms responsible for
enhanced coagulation remain unclear. The particle concentration mechanisms discussed below
could augment particle sticking. As shown explicitly in Johansen et al. (2009b), collision speeds
are reduced in dense particle clumps.
Most experimental work on grain-grain collisions uses porous silicates. If ices are stickier,
growth beyond millimeter sizes is possible. In the low pressure of disks, ices sublimate; there
is no liquid available to make the equivalent of wet snow. Saturn’s rings are an excellent lab-
oratory to explore the outcomes of gentle, ∼mm s−, collisions between ices (Youdin and Shu
2002). Here, sticking forces are constrained by their inability to overcome tidal shear and pro-
duce growth beyond ∼5-m objects. Terrestrial experiments on low-temperature ices suggest that
centimeter-sized frosty objects stick at collision speeds below ∼0.1 m s−(Supulver et al. 1997).
While possibly a crucial ingredient, this limit appears insufficient to allow icy surfaces to bridge
the meter-sized barrier.
4.2 Gravitational Collapse of Solids into Planetesimals
Self-gravity provides a qualitatively different route to the formation of planetesimals. Instead
of bottom-up growth, the gravitational instability (GI) hypothesis of Safronov (1969) and
Goldreich and Ward (1973) offers a top-down approach. In this theory, a sea of small solids
collapses coherently into a gravitationally bound planetesimal. This collapse does not rely on
sticking forces, proceeds faster than radial drift, and bypasses the meter-sized barrier.
The gravitational collapse hypothesis encounters several theoretical difficulties. The crucial
issue is the ability of turbulent gas to prevent collapse (Weidenschilling 1995). Until recently,
these theoretical obstacles seemed insurmountable. Progress in coupled particle-gas dynamics
has led to a revival (Youdin and Shu 2002; Johansen et al. 2006, 2007; Cuzzi et al. 2008; Youdin
2011a). Some of these mechanisms use aerodynamic concentration as the initial concentration
mechanism ( >Sect. 4.3), but all eventually rely on self-gravity for the final collapse to solid
densities.

From Disks to Planets 1
27
We focus in this subsection on “pure” gravitational collapse from a relatively smooth back-
ground. Although separating these processes from aerodynamic concentration is artificial, this
historical approach allows us to isolate the main issues of each mechanism. We first discuss the
standard model of gravitational collapse of a disk of solids, which has many similarities to grav-
itational instabilities in a gas disk ( >Sect. 5). We then briefly describe how gas drag changes
this standard picture, a research area where progress is still being made.
The simplest criterion for gravitational collapse requires self-gravity to overcome the tidal
distortion of the central star. This condition is met when the particle density exceeds the Roche
limit,

where m∗= M∗/M⊙and F is the mass enhancement factor for the MMSN from >Sect. 2.
Sekiya (1983) derives this result for the case of a disk midplane with solids perfectly coupled
to an incompressible gas, making use of the powerful formalism of Goldreich and Lynden-Bell
(1965). The relation of this critical density to the Toomre (1964) Q criterion for GI is discussed
(in the context of planetesimals) by Chiang and Youdin (2010) and Youdin (2011a).

Though the current relevance is not so clear, this kind of estimate played a key role in defining
the canonical planetesimal size to be near a kilometer.
To satisfy the density criterion of ( > 1.58), solids must settle vertically to a midplane layer
with thickness HR = Σp/ρR. Even the faintest whiff of turbulence probably produces a much
thicker layer. Although the disk midplane could be a “dead zone” devoid of magnetized turbu-
lence (Gammie 1996), interactions among particles can drive enough turbulence to halt settling
(Youdin 2010).
Vertical shear instabilities usually prevent the sedimentation of small particles into a layer
thinner than Hη ≃ηR (Weidenschilling 1980; Youdin and Shu 2002). As particle inertia in the
midplane increases from sedimentation, solids begin to drag the midplane gas toward the full
Keplerian speed. As in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the vertical shear with the overlying
particle-poor gas drives overturning. With Hη/HR ∼, GI seems ruled out.
The revival of the GI hypothesis requires abandoning two faulty assumptions. The surface
density of solids can increase above MMSN – or any initial – values. The evolution of solid and
gas components decouples due to drift motions (Stepinski and Valageas 1996). The radial drift
of small solids from the outer disk generically leads to “particle pileups,” a snowplow effect that
increases the surface density in the inner disk (Youdin and Shu 2002; Youdin and Chiang 2004).
The local concentration mechanisms discussed in >Sect. 4.3 can be even more powerful.
The critical Roche density is also too stringent. Planetesimal formation can be triggered
when ρp ≳ρg, a criterion about a 100 times less severe than the Roche limit in ( > 1.58).
Several interesting effects arise when the particle density approaches the gas density. Vertical
shear instabilities lose their ability to overturn a layer that is so heavy (Sekiya 1998; Youdin
and Shu 2002). When disk rotation is included, the case for particle inertia halting vertical
overturning is less clear (Gómez and Ostriker 2005; Lee et al. 2010). However, when perfect

28 1
From Disks to Planets
coupling is relaxed, and streaming instabilities appear, the relevance of ρp ≳ρg reemerges as
the threshold for strong clumping, as described below.
When gas drag is present, the Roche density is not the relevant criteria for GI. Ward
(1976, 2000) investigated a dissipative mode of GI that has no formal stability threshold. Col-
lapse always occurs in principle, but it becomes slower and spans a larger radial extent for small
particles. Youdin (2011a) included radial turbulent diffusion and showed that radial spreading –
not vertical stirring – is the dominant stabilizing influence for dissipative GI. When vertical stir-
ring is accounted for, it turns out that ρp ≳ρg is typically required for dissipative GI to proceed
faster than radial drift. The result that dissipative GI depends so simply on particle inertia is
mostly a numerical coincidence and relies on the fact that Qg
√η ∼in the MMSN, see Eq. 55
of Youdin (2011a). The important point is that the relevance of particle inertia – specifically the
ρp ≳ρg criterion – has been established for a range of mechanisms.
Although this lesser degree of particle settling is substantial, it may require a local enrich-
ment of the disk metallicity, Z = Σp/Σg. If the particle scale height is set by particle-driven
turbulence to Hη, then the particle density exceeds the gas density if

again with m∗= M∗/M⊙. The near agreement with solar abundances is remarkable and could
be related to the correlation of giant planets with host star metallicity (Youdin and Shu 2002).
Assuming that the stellar photospheres reflect the abundance of solids in the disk (Fischer and
Valenti 2005), the early formation of planetesimals could be a crucial factor in the formation of
gas giants (Johansen et al. 2009b).
Though poorly constrained, the role of external (not particle-driven) midplane turbulence
may be interesting. For small solids, constraints on the level of turbulence that allows settling
to ρp ≳ρg are quite stringent. Using ( >1.57), sedimentation to ρp > ρg requires that midplane
turbulence satisfy

(1.61)
Thus, when trying to form planetesimals via GI, it helps to have some combination of weak tur-
bulence, particle growth, and enriched metallicity (Σp/Σg). These requirements become more
stringent toward the inner disk (Youdin 2011a).
Thus, even in the GI hypothesis, particle growth by coagulation plays a crucial role. Particles
must grow until they decouple from the gas. Provided this growth occurs, GI – likely aided by
other concentration mechanisms – provides a plausible way past the meter-sized barrier.
4.3 Aerodynamic Particle Concentration
We now consider aerodynamic processes that can concentrate particles even when self-gravity
is negligible. Many of these processes rely on the presence of turbulence in the disk. This con-
nection raises a general question: does turbulence help or hinder planetesimal formation? By
stirring particles, turbulence increases their collision speeds which can lead to more destructive
collisions. Furthermore, the diffusive effects of turbulence oppose particle settling and concen-
tration. On the other hand, turbulence can concentrate particles in a variety of ways. Which
tendency wins depends on details, notably particle size. Since small solids with τs ≪drift and
settle slowly, they require much weaker turbulence to participate in aerodynamic concentration.

Localized pressure maxima are very powerful particle traps. When the pressure bump takes
the form of an axisymmetric ring, the trap is very effective (Whipple 1972). Solids migrate into
these rings and accumulateat the center where they encounter no headwind. The MRI naturally
produces axisymmetric pressure bumps, via the generation of zonal flows that are somewhat
analogous to the surface winds of Jupiter (Johansen et al. 2009a; Fromang and Stone 2009). The
relevance of MRI-induced pressure maxima is subject to two caveats: turbulent stirring associ-
ated with MRI may lead to destructive collisions, and the disk midplane may be insufficiently
ionized for the MRI to operate (Turner et al. 2010).
Nonaxisymmetric pressure maxima can also trap particles. When the disk is young and
massive, spiral arms in the gas probably provide an important source of turbulence (Rice
et al. 2006). However, this phase of disk evolution may be too turbulent and/or brief for
significant planetesimal formation. Isolated pressure maxima take the form of anticyclonic vor-
tices (Chavanis 2000). Vortices are embedded in, and thus flow with, the sub-Keplerian gas
(Youdin 2010). Although the vortex center is not a stable point for particle concentration, a
point upstream (in the direction of orbital motion) is. The implications for vortex size are dis-
cussed in Youdin (2010). The formation and survival of vortices is a topic of ongoing research
(Lithwick 2009).
We have so far focused on particle concentration over many orbits where disk rotation and
Coriolis forces play a central role. Small turbulent eddies have short turnover times, teddy ≪
/Ω, and are unaffected by rotation. In this regime, pressure maxima occur not at the centers of
anticyclonic vortices but between vortices of either sign. The concentration of heavy particles
in these regions of low enstrophy (vorticity squared) was first described in the fluid dynamics
community (Maxey 1987).
Cuzzi et al. (2001) applied small-scale concentration to protoplanetary disks. They showed
that ∼1-mm solids – specifically the chondrules that are discussed in >Sect. 4.4 – can concen-
trate at the “inner” or dissipation scale of turbulence. These are the smallest eddies that have the
shortest turnover time ti. Particles with a matching stopping time, ts, ∼ti ∼s, are preferen-
tially flung from the eddies and concentrated between them. Chondrules can plausibly satisfy
this condition. The ability to concentrate such small particles makes this mechanism unique.
The relevance of such brief concentrations is unclear. The characteristic mass involved is also
quite small, at most that of a 10-cm rock (Chiang and Youdin 2010).
To overcome these issues, Cuzzi et al. (2008) developed a model that concentrates chon-
drules on larger scales that contain enough mass to form ∼100-km planetesimals. This model
involves a somewhat speculative extrapolation. In particular, it assumes that all scales of a
turbulent cascade contribute equally to the concentration of chondrule-sized particles. This
assumption is a significant deviation from the original mechanism that requires eddy and stop-
ping times to match. See Chiang and Youdin (2010) for further discussion, which concludes
that more study of this intriguing mechanism is required.
Clearly particle concentration mechanisms are fraught with uncertainties in the detailed
dynamical behavior of gas in protoplanetary disks. Some – certainly not all – of these uncer-
tainties are overcome by the realization that particles can cause their own concentration by
collectively altering the gas dynamics (Goodman and Pindor 2000). In the streaming instability
of Youdin and Goodman (2005), particle concentrations arise spontaneously from radial drift
motions. As described in > Sect. 4.1.1, these drift motions are an inevitable consequence of
pressure support in disks. The linear growth of streaming instabilities is strongest for ρp > ρg,
because particle inertia mustbe large for drag feedback to influence gas motions. When ρp < ρg,
growth is fastest for τs ≈, when drift speeds are fastest (Youdin and Johansen 2007). While
streaming instabilities involve complex dynamics – 3D motions of both the gas and solid

components – simplified toy models (Goodman and Pindor 2000; Chiang and Youdin 2010)
and considerations of geostrophic balance (Jacquet et al. 2011) helpexplain how particle density
perturbations self-reinforce.
Numerical simulations show that the nonlinear clumping from the streaming instability
can be quite strong (Johansen and Youdin 2007; Johansen et al. 2009b; Balsara et al. 2009; Bai
and Stone 2010a). Particle densities ≳ρg are achieved in the absence of self-gravity, and
clumping tends to increase with numerical resolution. The conditions for strong clumping are
similar to those giving rapid linear growth: partial decoupling, τs ≳., and large particle inertia
ρp ≳.ρg.
When vertical stratification is included, the midplane particle density evolves consistently
due to settling and stirring by both streaming and vertical shearing instabilities. In these sim-
ulations, there is a critical disk metallicity for particle clumping which is slightly supersolar
(Johansen et al. 2009b; Bai and Stone 2010a), consistent with ( > 1.60). This metallicity varies
with the radial pressure gradient, η; smaller gradients promote clumping (Johansen et al. 2007;
Bai and Stone 2010b).
In >Sect. 4.2, we noted that GI depends on particle growth by coagulation. Since parti-
cle sedimentation to ρp ≳ρg is a crucial prerequisite, particle growth remains essential when
the streaming instability provides the initial particle concentration. However, growth need not
result in a single particle size or a very narrow size distribution. Though the smallest solids par-
ticipate less in clumping by streaming instabilities, including a dispersion in particle sizes does
not prevent strong clumping (Johansen et al. 2007).
The particle concentration produced by the streaming instability is more than sufficient
to trigger gravitational collapse. Johansen et al. (2007) formed gravitationally bound objects
equivalent to ∼500-km planetesimals within only a few orbits of initial collapse. More recent
simulations suggest the formation of lower mass objects with equivalent ∼100–200-km radii
(Johansen et al. 2009b). The crucial differences are the inclusion of the MRI in the earlier
study and smaller particle sizes in the second. The inclusion of particle collisions also has a
modest effect on the resulting planetesimal masses (Johansen et al. 2012). A more thorough
investigation of parameter space, combined with resolution studies, is required. The massive
planetesimals produced in these simulations exceed the standard estimate of kilometer-sized
planetesimals because gravitational collapse occurs not from a smooth background but from
aerodynamically concentrated clumps.
4.4 Observational Constraints on Planetesimal Formation
We now discuss how observations constrain dynamical theories of planetesimal formation. The
solar system provides the most detailed information on planetesimals and allows comparison
between the inner asteroidal reservoir and the Kuiper belt objects and comets of the outer
solar system. The crucial issue is to what extent today’s planetesimals reveal the clues of their
formation, especially after ∼4 Gyr of dynamical, collisional, and thermal evolution.
Primitive, undifferentiated meteorites give us a hands-on view of the composition of plan-
etesimals. The most common of these are the aptly named “ordinary chondrites.” With filling
factors up to 90%, they are primarily composed of 0.1–1-mm chondrules. Chondrules are glassy
spheres, poetically referred to as “fiery drops of rain” (Sorby 1863). The origin of chondrules –
in particular their source of heating – is debated and beyond our scope, see Hewins (1996). The
prevalence of chondrules in ordinary chondrites strongly motivates further investigation of the
mechanisms that could concentrate solids this small (Cuzzi et al. 2001, 2008).

From Disks to Planets 1
31
Despite this attractive conclusion, chondrules may not be the universal building blocks of
all planetesimals. Because their abundances most closely match solar, the CI class of chondrites
is considered the most primitive (Lodders 2003). Yet CI chondrites contain no chondrules. It
is also unclear whether chondrules were present in the first generation of planetesimals. Most
chondrules formed at least 1.5 Myr and up to 4 Myr after the rarer CAIs (calcuim-aluminum
inclusions; Connelly et al. 2007; Krot et al. 2007). Thus, planetesimals probably formed before
major chondrule forming events, especially the planetesimals that formed the cores of Jupiter
and Saturn. Since planetesimals that form early will trap more radioactive heat and differenti-
ate, it seems likely that the undifferentiated chondrites represent a later phase of planetesimal
formation (Kleine et al. 2005). The relation between chondrules, meteorites, and planetesimal
formation continues to be the focus of intense interdisciplinary research.
Planetesimals that remain in the asteroid belt can also provide clues to their formation. The
radially banded zonation of different spectral classes of asteroids is well known (Gradie and
Tedesco 1982). This observation suggests separate formation epochs, with each event creating a
“clan” of chemically and spectrally similar planetesimals. Youdin (2011a) proposed large-scale,
drag-mediated GI as the cause of these events.
The size distribution of objects within planetesimal belts provides other clues to their for-
mation. Breaks in the size distribution – that is, changes in its power-law slope – point to shifts
in formation and/or erosion processes. The asteroid belt has a break near a radius ∼50 km.
Morbidelli et al. (2009a) argue that the asteroids with radii ≳50 km reflect their initial sizes.
Specifically they assert that the largest asteroids have undergone minimal collisional evolu-
tion and could not have formed via collisional growth of smaller planetesimals. Since most
of the mass is contained in the largest asteroids, their model plausibly produces the numer-
ous small objects below the break via collisional disruption. That interpretation places GI as
the preferred formation mechanism. By including streaming instabilities, the simulations of
Johansen et al. (2007) predicted that large initial sizes were possible. Conclusively proving
that a size distribution is unobtainable by collisional growth is rather difficult. Weidenschilling
(2010) contends that collisional growth of asteroids can be accomplished starting with 0.1-
km planetesimals – which themselves presumably grew by coagulation past the meter-sized
barrier.
Curiously, the Kuiper belt also has break in its size distribution at ∼50-km radii (Bernstein
et al. 2004). This break is not measureddirectly; a combination of an observed luminosity distri-
bution and an estimate of the albedo yields the distribution of radii (Petit et al. 2008). Ongoing
surveys of the Kuiper belt seek to provide constraints on the size distribution for the various
components of the Kuiper belt.
Understanding the origin of the break requires a model for KBO formation and dynamical
interactions with gas giants. Reproducing the observed size distribution with collisional growth
models requires an initially massive Kuiper belt followed by dynamical depletion; a break occurs
when depletion excites erosive collisions among KBOs with radii below the break (Kenyon and
Bromley 2004c). The break radius depends on excitation; more (less) excitation by more (less)
massive gas giants yields a break at larger (smaller) radii. Matching the location of the break and
the apparent slope of the KBO size distribution below the break requires numerical calculations
with growth and depletion, which are an active area of research (Kenyon et al. 2008a; Morbidelli
et al. 2008).
The relative roles of collisional and dynamical depletion affect the interpretation of the KBO
size break. Pan and Sari (2005) argue that the break is not primordial but due to ongoing colli-
sional erosion that continues to push the break to larger sizes. However, Nesvorný et al. (2011)
claim that this collisional history is ruled out on two grounds. First, the collisional strengths

32 1
From Disks to Planets
required for such destruction are too weak. Second, such an intense collisional bombardment
would destroy the observed Kuiper belt binaries.
The observed binary fraction in the cold, classical Kuiper belt is ≳20% (Noll et al. 2008). The
colors of the two components of Kuiper belt binaries are nearly identical, a fact interpreted as
representing a common chemical composition (Benecchi et al. 2009). This observation provides
the most compelling support for the GI hypothesis in the outer solar system or perhaps any-
where. Gravitational collapse can naturally produce binary planetesimals as a consequence of
angular momentum conservation during the contraction of a swarm of small solids (Nesvorný
et al. 2010). Binaries – and higher-order multiples – formed this way should have the same
chemical composition since they formed from the same well-mixed clump of small solids.
While mechanisms for the dynamical capture of KBO binaries are well developed (Goldreich
et al. 2002; Noll et al. 2008), these models do not obviously explain matching colors. Moreover,
the physical conditions require for capture, making the collisional survival of these binaries
questionable (Nesvorný et al. 2011), especially for wide binaries (Parker and Kavelaars 2012).
Outside the solar system, exoplanets and debris disks inform the prevalence and conse-
quences of planetesimal formation. The higher incidence of giant planets around stars with
supersolar metallicities (discussed in >Sect. 2.3) might be tied to planetesimal formation. As
shown in ( > 1.60), this connection is strongly suggested by the supersolar disk metallicity
threshold for strong clumping by streaming instabilities. Since the disk metallicity can increase
over time (Youdin and Chiang 2004), this threshold does not imply that lower metallicity stars
can never form planetesimals.
Indeed, the streaming instability/GI model explains why lower metallicity and lower mass
stars should form less massive planets (Johansen et al. 2009b). Either directly or by the passage
of time, enriching the disk metallicity involves the loss of gas. Thus, the initially low metallicity
systems that require enrichment are less likelytoform giant planets. This conclusion is especially
true in the lower mass disks thought to surround lower mass stars. These general trends are
revealed by radial velocity surveys (Sousa et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2010). The Kepler transit
survey will test these trends, since it is finding striking numbers of small, short-period planets
(Howard et al. 2012; Youdin 2011b). Characterization of the Kepler stars will thus powerfully
constrain planetesimal formation models.

Planetesimals to Planets
Once planetesimals become larger than a few kilometers – potentially they are born much
larger as discussed above – gravitationally focused collisions dominate growth into proto-
planets. The size when “planetesimals” become “protoplanets” is vague. Although we use the
terms interchangeably, ∼1,000 km is a useful threshold. Depending on location and gas tem-
perature, ∼1,000-km protoplanets are the smallest planets capable of binding disk gas into an
atmosphere.
We describe the accretion of solid protoplanets in >Sect. 5.1. We start by discussing the
processes that operate in a gas-free disk, including gravitationally focused collisions
( >Sect. 5.1.2), velocity excitation ( >Sect. 5.1.3), and collisional fragmentation ( >Sect. 5.1.4).
We then describe planetesimal interactions with the gaseous disk (
> Sect. 5.1.5).

( >Sect. 5.2.2) and transforms a planetary core into a gas giant ( > Sects. 5.2.3 and >5.2.4).
We discuss numerical simulations combining the growth of giant planet cores and atmospheres
in >Sect. 5.2.5. Finally, a young, massive gas disk might fragment directly into a gas giant or
a brown dwarf. >Section 5.3 describes this formation channel and whether it might explain
some exoplanets, especially massive giants at large radial distances.
5.1 Growth of Solid Protoplanets
Unlike planetesimal formation, it is easy to understand why planetesimals grow into larger
protoplanets, even if the details are complicated. For the largest planetesimal in any region of
the disk, collisions essentially always result in growth. Planetesimal velocities cannot be locally
excited above the escape speed of the largest protoplanet. Consequently, the kinetic energy of
collisions does not exceed the gravitational potential at the surface of the largest protoplanet.
Collisions dissipate a fraction, sometime quite large, of the impact kinetic energy. Even if the
impacting planetesimal shatters, growth is assured.
Collisions among smaller planetesimals, however, often lead to erosion or catastrophic frag-
mentation. When an external, massive perturber stirs a belt of planetesimals, planetesimals
collide at velocities larger than their escape velocity. These high-velocity collisions tend to erode
or completely shatter planetesimals. The dust and changes in the planetesimal size distribution
that result from these collisions are relevant for debris disks and for asteroids and Kuiper belt
objects.
Unlike the planetesimal formation phase, aerodynamic drag no longer plays a starring
role in protoplanet growth. However, drag can still help regulate planetesimal velocities. The
accretion of atmospheres (see >Sect. 5.2) also affects planetesimal capture.
Deriving the precise evolution of a swarm of planetesimals is a complex numerical problem
being attacked from several angles ( >Sect. 5.1.6). However, we can develop a reasonably accu-
rate picture of the evolution with the “two groups approximation” reviewed in greater detail
by Goldreich et al. (2004). This approximation considers interactions between small, low-mass
planetesimals with mass ms and larger, more massive planetesimalswith mass ml. The planetes-
imal masses ms,l = πr
s,l ρ●/are related to their radii rs,l and internal mass density, which we
fix at ρ●= gcm−unless stated otherwise. Neighboring planetesimals have similar semimajor
axes, a, and orbital frequencies, Ω. Though detailed treatments need not make this approxi-
mation, we equate orbital eccentricities es,l and inclinations (in radians) but allow es and el to
differ. The random velocities relative to a circular orbit are thus vs,l ≈es,l Ωa, and the vertical
scale heights of the planetesimal disks are Hs,l ≈vs,l/Ω. When the nature of the planetesimal is
unspecified, we drop the s and l subscripts.
5.1.1 Basic Length and Velocity Scales
A useful scale for studying interactions of planetesimals and protoplanets is the Hill (1878)
radius
RH = ( m

(1.62)

From Disks to Planets
Planetesimals separated by ≲RH are within the Hill sphere where their mutual gravitational
attraction dominates the tidal gravity from the central star. While a mutual Hill radius can be
defined, in practice it suffices to consider the more massive planetesimal.
The size of a planetesimal in Hill units defines the parameter

(1.63)
where ρ∗is the mean mass density of the central star. Since ρ∗/ρ●∼, the parameter ψ ∼R∗/a
is roughly the angular size of the central star as observed from the planetesimal. The smallness
of ψ represents the fact that physical collisions are rare compared to gravitational scattering.
At the Hill radius, the orbital speed about the protoplanet is the Hill velocity
vH = ΩRH = ( m
M∗
)
/
vK .
(1.64)
When planetesimal random velocities exceed vH, two-body encounters are “dispersion domi-
nated,” negligibly affected by orbital shear. Random speeds below vH cause “shear-dominated”
encounters that involve (restricted) three-body dynamics. We describe below how the Hill
velocity divides different accretion regimes.
The outcome of a shear-dominated encounter between planetesimals depends on the dif-
ference in semimajor axes δR, relative to the Hill radius (Petit and Henon 1986). When
δR ≲1–2 RH, the two planetesimals are deflected on a horseshoe orbit. More distant encoun-
ters with δR ≳
√
RH result in small-angle scattering. For intermediate separations, 1–2 RH
≲δr ≲
√
RH, planetesimals enter the Hill sphere, experience chaotic deflections, and (if no
collision occurs) leave the Hill sphere with typical relative velocity vH.
In Hill units, the escape speed from the surface of a protoplanet, vesc = [Gm/r]/, is
vesc ∼vH/ψ/. Planetesimal velocities can be gravitationally excited up to the escape speed of
the largest protoplanet. To estimate when a massive protoplanet might eject nearby planetesi-
mals (or protoplanets), we compare the escape velocity of the protoplanet to the orbital escape
velocity, vesc,∗≈

exceeds unity, a planet of mass m can eject other nearby protoplanets. Terrestrial planets like
Earth are too low mass and too close to the Sun to eject objects. The four solar system giants
can all eject planetesimals; Jupiter is the most efficient at ejecting comets (and spacecraft) from
the solar system (Fernandez and Ip 1984). Aside from collisional grinding, ( > 1.65) implies
that planetesimal formation is more efficient closer to a star.
The concepts of the Hill sphere and the Roche lobe are identical, though often used in
different contexts. Both describe the region where the gravity of an object exceeds the tidal per-
turbation from its companion. Formally, both volumes are defined by the critical equipotential
containing the Land LLagrange points. The Roche lobe is more distorted than a sphere when
it describes binary stars that are similar in mass. The Roche radius or Roche limit describes the
distance from a primary object at which the secondary becomes tidally disrupted and might
form planetary rings. Aside from order unity corrections due to fluid effects or internal strength,
the concept of individual versus tidal gravity is again identical. To summarize, a secondary is
at the Roche limit from the primary when it fills its own Hill sphere (or Roche Lobe). For an

From Disks to Planets 1
35
ensemble of very small planetesimals trying to become a much larger planetesimal, the Roche
limit sets the critical density for gravitational collapse ( > 1.58).
5.1.2 Gravitationally Focused Collisions
In this section, we describe the growth rates of large protoplanets (subscripted by l) accret-
ing either large protoplanets or smaller planetesimals (unsubscripted). Gravitational focusing
is the most important aspect of growth. Smaller random velocities for accreted planetesimals
yield larger gravitational focusing factors and shorter growth times. We defer to later sec-
tions the self-consistent calculation of planetesimal velocities and assume the standard case,
vl < vs. Greenberg et al. (1984), Wetherill and Stewart (1993), Kenyon and Bromley (2008),
and references in each paper describe more detailed expressions for growth rates.
We begin with the dispersion-dominated regime where v > vH,l. The mass accretion rate
results from the usual isotropic expression as ˙ml = mnσv. Adopting the surface mass density
of planetesimals, Σ, the number density of planetesimals, n, is
mnv = ΣΩ .
(1.66)
The cross section
σ = π(rl + r)fG,disp
(1.67)
is the product of the geometric area and the gravitational focusing factor fG,disp. If the veloc-
ity of the incoming planetesimal at infinity is v > vesc,l, there is no gravitational focusing and
fG,disp = . When v ≪vesc,l, the speed on impact is roughly vesc,l. Angular momentum con-
servation during a two-body encounter sets the impact parameter for a grazing collision as
rlvesc,l/v. This expression yields fG,disp ≈(vesc,l/v). Including energy conservation gives both
cases simultaneously as
fG,disp = + β(vesc,l/v),
(1.68)
where β = for a pure two-body interaction and β ≈.accounts for anisotropic effects intro-
duced by orbital dynamics (Greenzweig and Lissauer 1990; Spaute et al. 1991; Wetherill and
Stewart 1993).
Putting these results together and ignoring order unity coefficients give the dispersion-
dominated growth timescale ml/ ˙ml as
tdisp ≈
ρ●rl
ΣΩ fG,disp
.
(1.69)
This result is just the geometric collision time over the focusing factor.
For shear-dominated encounters with v < vH,l, collision rates are affected by chaotic trajec-
tories inside the Hill sphere (Greenberg et al. 1991; Dones and Tremaine 1993). In this regime,
planetesimal disks are thinner than the Hill radius, H ∼v/Ω < RH,l. Thus, planetesimals enter
the Hill sphere at the 2D mass accretion rate, ˙mH ∼ΣR
H,lΩ. The probability, P, of a collision
within the Hill sphere has two cases. Both use the maximum impact parameter for gravitation-
ally focused collisions bmax ∼rlvesc,l/vH,l ∼ψ/RH,l. If the scale height of the disk is (relatively)
thick with H ∼v/Ω > bmax, the collision probability P ∼b
max/(RH,l H) is the ratio of the colli-
sion cross section to the area of the accreting disk of planetesimals. For a thinner planetesimal
disk, P ∼bmax/RH,l is the ratio of the impact parameter to the Hill radius.

36 1
From Disks to Planets
Combining the mass flow rate through the Hill sphere with both limits of the collision
probability yields the shear-dominated growth timescale, ml/(P ⋅˙mH), as
tshear ∼
ρ●rl
ΣΩ fG,shear
.
(1.70)
This timescale is again expressed as the product of the geometric collision time and a gravita-
tional focusing factor
fG,shear ∼(ψ v
vH,l
+ ψ/)
−
.
(1.71)
Thus, for v < ψ/vH,l, gravitational focusing reaches its maximum value of fG ∼ψ−/, resulting
in the fastest possible growth rate. Because inclination excitation is weak in the shear-dominated
regime, this fastest thin-disk accretion rate likely applies for all large protoplanets with vl <
vH,l (Goldreich et al. 2004). Aside from this issue of anisotropic velocities, the dispersion and
shear-dominated focusing factors match at v ∼vH,l with fG ∼/ψ.
For numerical estimatesof growth timescales, we consider three cases. For the slow case, we
take v > vesc,l and no gravitational focusing. For the intermediate case, we identify v ≈vH,l ≈
ψ/vesc,l as the transition between shear and dispersion, dominated. The fast case considers the
maximum focusing factor fG ≈ψ−/appropriate for v ≲ψ/vH,l ≈ψvesc,l (and possibly for
higher speeds when planetesimal i ≪e). Using ( >1.2) for the surface density of planetesimals,
the growth times become

These mass doubling times increase with protoplanet mass. Thus, if gravitational focusing stays
fixed or decreases (far from a certainty), these estimates also give the total accumulation time.
These expressions omit the dependence on stellar mass and planet density for clarity but the
growth times scale ∝ρ/
●/M∗/, ρ/
●/M∗/, and ρ/
●M∗for the three cases, respectively.
Though stellar mass is not a major dynamical effect, it could correlate with disk mass or metal-
licity (here meaning planetesimal to gas ratio), normalized above by F and Zrel, respectively.
Higher density protoplanets have smaller cross sections and grow more slowly, but this effect
becomes much less significant as gravitational focusing increases.
Gravitational focusing dramatically speeds up the growth of protoplanets, especially in the
outer disk. Without focusing, planets accumulate in tslow ∼tens of Myr inside a few AU and
more than 1 Gyr outside 5 AU. While a long growth time for terrestrial planets is acceptable,
gas giants must form within a few Myr. Thus, formation of giant planet cores in the outer disk
requires strong focusing, when the growth time for a M⊕core at 50 AU, tfast ∼Myr, is close
to the lifetime of most gas disks. If strong focusing occurs, the formation of distant gas giants
depends on the ability of cores to accrete gas (Rafikov 2011).
Protoplanet accretion also depends on how the velocity distribution evolves. In dispersion-
dominated gravitational focusing, the growth time tdisp ∝/rl; larger planetesimals grow
faster than smaller ones. Although it is not the fastest regime, this “runaway” growth requires

From Disks to Planets 1
37
that gravitational focusing factors remain in the dispersion-dominated regime. With vesc/vH ∼
ψ−/∝a/, runaway growth persists longer in the outer disk (Greenzweig and Lissauer 1990).
When the largest protoplanets enter the shear-dominated regime, runawaygrowth ends. For
the thick disk case, tshear ∝r
l is independent of size. With either no focusing, tslow ∝rl, or the
fastest (thin-disk) shear-dominated accretion tfast ∝rl, smaller protoplanets grow faster and
can catch up to the larger ones. In this “oligarchic” growth, many oligarchs compete to accrete
small planetesimals, leading to an ensemble of oligarchs throughout the disk.
As the largest protoplanets grow, they try to accrete all solid material in their vicinity.
Two planets on circular orbits separated by a little more than 2
√
RH are stable (Gladman
1993). However, a fairly stable system with more planets requires larger separations, ∼BRH with
B = 7–10 (Lissauer 1987; Kokubo and Ida 1998). Planets that accrete all material within BRH are
“isolated.” Setting miso = πΣaBRH leads to the isolation mass,

(1.73)
With F = 1 and Zrel = ., isolated objects in the terrestrial zone have masses comparable
to Mercury and Mars. The MMSN has room for 30–50 isolated objects between the orbits of
Mercury and Mars. Because their escape velocities are much smaller than their orbital veloci-
ties ( > 1.65), isolated protoplanets eventually collide and merge to form Earth-mass planets
(>Fig. 1-8).
Outside the snow line, Zrel = .at 5 AU yields an isolation mass of roughly 1 M⊕. As we
show later, this mass is too small to bind the gas required for a gas giant. Increasing the mass of
the MMSN (F ≈5) increases the isolation mass to the “typical” core mass of 10 M⊕needed for
a massive atmosphere. Thus, the MMSN is fine for the terrestrial planets, but it is not massive
enough to allow formation of gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn. The extra mass required
is consistent with observations of disks around the youngest stars ( >Sect. 2).
5.1.3 Planetesimal Velocity Evolution
As the previous section makes clear, the evolution of planetesimal velocities establishes the
rate protoplanets accrete smaller planetesimals. Gravitational scattering is more common than
physical collisions; thus, planetesimal velocities rapidly adjust as large protoplanets grow.
Several processes modify the random velocities of planetesimals. The source of random
kinetic energy is known as viscous stirring. This process uses planetesimal encounters – pre-
dominantly gravitational scattering – to extract energy from orbital shear. Dynamical friction
redistributes kinetic energy among planetesimals of different masses, pushing them toward
equipartition. Thus, smaller (larger) planetesimals damp (excite) the random velocities of the
larger (smaller) planetesimals (Wetherill and Stewart 1989; Kokubo and Ida 1995; Kenyon and
Luu 1998). Ignoring ejections and gas drag, physical collisions are the only source of kinetic
energy damping. Collisional damping is especially effective for small planetesimals, r ≲1–
100 m, that collide frequently (Ohtsuki 1992; Kenyon and Luu 1998). When collisions produce
small fragments that collide even more frequently, damping is very efficient. Goldreich et al.
(2004) discuss order-of-magnitude derivations of these processes. As with accretion, behav-
iors vary between the dispersion- and shear-dominated regimes. It is common to refer to the
excitation and damping of planetesimal velocities as “heating” and “cooling,” respectively.

38 1
From Disks to Planets
The main goal of this introduction to velocity evolution is to show that planetesimals cannot
be heated above – and can sometimes be cooled significantly below – the escape velocity of
the large protoplanets. We focus on dispersion-dominated encounters to explain this result,
which is crucial for ensuring the gravitationally focused collisions required to make planets on
reasonable timescales.
We first consider the simple case where all planetesimals have the same size. When v < vesc,
viscous stirring is dominated by gravitational scattering and occurs on the scattering timescale.
This heating timescale is well approximated by the two-body relaxation time from stellar
dynamics (Binney and Tremaine 2008). For the nσv estimateof the gravitational scattering rate,
we use ( >1.66) and compute the cross section σ ∼b
scatt from the impact parameter for strong
gravitational scattering, bscatt ∼Gm/v. Together, these give the viscous stirring timescale (Ida
and Makino 1993)

where the constant C≈/arises from a more detailed analysis (Ohtsuki et al. 2002) and
is similar to the Coulomb logarithm, ln Λ, in stellar dynamics (and plasma physics). The final
approximate expression in ( > 1.74) facilitates comparison with the collision rates.
The cooling rate is the gravitationally focused collision rate, which follows from ( > 1.69)
as
tcool,disp ∼ρ●r
ΣΩ ( v


.
(1.75)
Balancing the stirring and cooling rates implies v ∼vesc. While the correct answer, the rea-
soning is incomplete. Gravitational focusing is weak for v ≳vesc. In this regime, stirring and
collisional cooling rates are comparable. A slight imbalance in favor of heating could lead to
runaway growth of v and an eventual collisional cascade. This runaway requires nearly elastic
physical collisions, as in the collision of two basketballs. In the idealized modelof Goldreich and
Tremaine (1978), collisions among planetesimals with coefficients of restitution ≳.(compa-
rable to a baseball, but smaller than a basketball or a table tennis ball) bounce often enough to
lead to runaway heating. Coefficients of restitution for planetesimals are probably much smaller
than 0.5 (Porco et al. 2008); the velocity runaway is unlikely. Similarly sized planetesimals will
excite random velocities to the surface escape speed, v ∼vesc.
Returning to the two groups approximation, we consider stirring of small planetesimals
by large protoplanets. Dynamical friction ensures vs > vl (confirmed below); planetesimals
dominate the encounter speed. The stirring of small planetesimals by larger ones then occurs
on a timescale

(1.76)
Comparison with ( > 1.74) shows that large planetesimals dominate the stirring of small plan-
etesimals when Σlml > Σsms. Initially, Σs > Σl; small planetesimals contain enough mass
to affect growth. To dominate stirring, however, large planetesimals can contain a minority of
the mass.
Due to stronger stirring by large protoplanets, small planetesimals are excited to vs > vesc,s.
At these speeds, collisions between small planetesimals generally cause collisional fragmenta-
tion or erosion. The resulting smaller planetesimals then collisionally cool more efficiently. Even
without this extra cooling, gravitational focusing arises. When vs > vesc,s, small planetesimals

(1.77)
When Σs > Σl, vs ≪vesc,l; small planetesimal accretion is strongly gravitationally focused.
We now consider whether the growth of large protoplanets is dominated by the accretion of
small planetesimals or other large protoplanets. Planetesimals with the larger product of surface
density and gravitational focusing, Σ fG, drive the fastest growth ( >1.69)–( >1.70). A balance
of viscous self-stirring and cooling by dynamical friction against small planetesimals then sets
the velocitydispersion oflarge protoplanets. Fordispersion-dominated encounters, this balance

(1.78)
Since Σ fG,disp ∝Σ/v, small planetesimals contribute more to the growth of large protoplanets,
by a factor (Σs/Σl)/> .
This introduction only begins to touch on the complexities of planetesimal velocity evolu-
tion. However, even these simple considerations show that gravitationally focused accretion of
small planetesimals by large protoplanets is likely. Earlier, we explained that collisional erosion
plays a key role in cooling small planetesimals to vs > vesc,s. Now, we turn to even more violent
encounters, with vs ≫vesc,s, which lead to catastrophic disruption.
5.1.4 Fragmentation
As large planetesimals grow, they stir up the velocities of smaller planetesimals to the disruption
velocity. Instead of mergers, collisions then yield smaller planetesimals and debris. Continued
disruptive collisions lead to a collisional cascade, where leftover planetesimals are slowly ground
to dust (Dohnanyi 1969; Williams and Wetherill 1994; Kobayashi and Tanaka 2010). Radia-
tion pressure from the central star ejects dust grains with r ≲1–10 μm; Poynting-Robertson
drag pulls larger grains into the central star (Burns et al. 1979; Artymowicz 1988; Takeuchi and
Artymowicz 2001). Eventually, small planetesimals are accreted by the large planetesimals or
ground to dust.
To understand the origin of the collisional cascade, we consider the outcome of a head-on
collision between two identical planetesimals. During the impact, some kinetic energy heats
up the planetesimals; the rest goes into the internal energy of material in the planetesimals.
When the impact energy is small, the extra internal energy is small compared to the binding
energy of either planetesimal; the two objects merge into a single, larger planetesimal. When
the impact energy is larger than the binding energy, the collision shatters the planetesimals into
a few smaller planetesimals and a lot of dust.
Estimating the binding energy of planetesimals relies on two approaches (Davis et al.
1985; Housen and Holsapple 1990, 1999; Holsapple 1994; Benz and Asphaug 1999; Leinhardt
et al. 2008; Leinhardt and Stewart 2009). Sophisticated collision experiments yield the inter-
nal strengths of small rocky and icy objects, r ≲10–100 cm. Theoretical investigations derive
the strength from analytic or numerical models of the crystalline structure and the equation of
state of the material.In both cases, investigators derive the energy Q∗
D required to remove half of

40 1

the combined mass of two colliding planetesimals and eject this mass to infinity. Although more
sophisticated approaches include the impact velocity in Q∗
D, we focus on a simpler expression
that depends only on radius,
Q∗
D = Qbrβb
s + ρQgr
βg
s .
(1.79)
Here Qbrβb
s
is the bulk (tensile) component of the binding energy, and ρQgr
βg
s
is the gravity
component of the binding energy.
Laboratory experiments and detailed numerical collision simulations yield a broad range
of results for Q∗
D (>Fig. 1-7; Housen and Holsapple 1990; Benz and Asphaug 1999; Holsapple
et al. 2002; Leinhardt et al. 2008. In the strength regime at small sizes, the binding energy of a
planetesimal depends on the number of flaws – cracks, fissures, etc. – in the material. Larger
planetesimals have more flaws and smaller strengths. In the gravity regime at large sizes, the
binding energy depends on the internal pressure. Larger planetesimals have larger internal pres-
sures and larger strengths. The lower density and weaker crystalline structure of ice leads to
smaller strengths than basalts and other rocks.
Models for the breakup of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 suggest a smaller component of the
bulk strength (Asphaug and Benz 1996), implying small disruption energies for small planetes-
imals (> Fig. 1-7; “Rubble Pile”). A low strength is consistent with numerical simulations of
“rubble piles”; structures with countless flaws held loosely together. This structure probably

results after icy or rocky planetesimals suffer numerous impacts which disrupt the internal
structure (removing most of the tensile component of the binding energy) but do not destroy
the object.
The collisional cascade begins when the impact energy of colliding small planetesimals
equals Q∗
D. Because the random velocities of small planetesimals equal the escape velocities
of large planetesimals, the impact energy depends only on the mass of a large planetesimal.
Equating this energy to QD∗allows us to derive the “disruption mass,” the mass of a large plan-
etesimal at the onset of the collisional cascade. With vesc,s ≪vesc,l, the impact energy per unit
mass in the center-of-mass frame is roughly v/≈v
esc,l/. Setting this energy equal to Q∗
D, we
solve for the disruption mass:

When small planetesimals have sizes exceeding ∼1km, Q∗
D is fairly independent of their compo-
sition. For typical Q∗
D ≈−erg g−, the disruption mass is roughly 0.003–3 Pluto masses.
Collisional cascades begin well before planets reach their final masses.
Once disruption commences, the final mass of a planet depends on the timescale for the
collisional cascade (Kenyon and Bromley 2004a, 2008; Leinhardt and Richardson 2005). If dis-
ruptive collisions produce dust grains much faster than planets accrete planetesimals, planets
cannot grow much larger than the disruption radius and have a maximum mass ml,max ≈md.
However, if planets accrete grains and leftover planetesimals effectively, planets reach the isola-
tion mass before collisions and radiation pressure remove material from the disk (ml,max ≈miso;
Goldreich et al. 2004).
In a gas-free environment, larger md in the inner disk enables planets to accrete much of
the debris before destructive collisions and radiative processes remove it. Rocky planet masses
then approach the isolation mass. In the outer disk, smaller planets cannot accrete debris before
it is lost. Icy planets cannot grow much larger than md.
5.1.5 Planetesimal Accretion with Gas Damping
Gas slows the random velocities of smaller planetesimals. Larger protoplanets are less affected
by drag and are damped by dynamical friction. The drag force, FD, of ( > 1.49) damps the
kinetic energy of planetesimals (now with size rs, not the size s of dust, pebbles, and boulders)
at a rate tgas ≡vs(dvs/dt)−= vs(FD/ms)−. With ρg ∼ΣgΩ/cs, where cs is the gas sound

To understand the impact of damping, we consider an ensemble of small planetesimals stir-

If tgas < tcol l ∼ρ●rs/(ΣsΩ), drag exceeds collisions as the dominant cooling mechanism. This

To be damped by gas drag, planetesimals must exceed this minimum size. This somewhatcoun-

drag laws and (2) a velocity scale, vesc,s, that increases with size. The numerical value of the size
threshold decreases if Zrel is reduced due to an inefficiency of turning dust into planetesimals.
When ( >1.82) holds, the stronger damping of self-stirred planetesimals ensures vs < vesc,s.
Collisions are gravitationally focused, and runaway growth begins earlier than in a disk
without gas.
As growth proceeds, larger protoplanets dominate the stirring of smaller planetesimals.
With stronger stirring, smaller and smaller planetesimals are damped by nonlinear gas drag
instead of collisions. Even if collisions are initially more significant, gas drag becomes the dom-
inant coolant as growth proceeds. To compute the random speeds of small planetesimals, we
assume dispersion-dominated encounters and balance the heating of ( >1.76) with the cooling

With more mass in small planetesimals Σl < Σs ≪Σg, gravitational focusing, fG,disp ∼
(vesc,l/vs), becomes strong. Accretion of small planetesimals can become shear dominated. As
described in >Sect. 5.1.2, runaway growth transitions to oligarchy (but does not slow down)
in the transition to shear-dominated accretion. A self-consistent analysis of these processes is
facilitated by the numerical calculations summarized in >Sect. 5.1.6.
Details aside, the large oligarchs stir small planetesimals past their escape speed and up to
the disruption velocity( >Sect. 5.1.3). Disruptive collisions among small planetesimals produce
a collisional cascade, which grinds planetesimals into smaller and smaller objects. Without gas,
planetesimals are ground into small dust grains which are dragged into the star by Poynting-
Robertson drag or ejected from the planetary system by radiation pressure. With gas damping,
the collisional cascade halts at some intermediate size (∼10 cm to 10 m), depending on fac-
tors such as the mass of the oligarchs, gas density, material strength, and orbital distance. The
damped velocities are then slow enough that the oligarchs accrete these small rocks rapidly.
This rapid accretion enables oligarchs to reach the isolation mass on short timescales, even in
the outer disk (Rafikov 2004; Kenyon and Bromley 2009).
Collisional grinding a set of small planetesimals into small dust grains requires a very
depleted gas disk. For the cascade to proceed down to 1–10-μm particles, these grains must
decouple from the gas (on an orbital timescale, we assume for simplicity). Epstein drag applies
for low gas densities (and long gas mean free paths). From ( > 1.48a), particles with sizes
s ≳Σg/ρ●decouple from the gas. From ( > 1.1), the depletion factor (relative to the MMSN)
required to avoid entrainment is

This low-mass disk may not last very long. Nevertheless, current observational limits only con-
strain gas surface densities in debris disks to F ≲% of the MMSN, not yet sufficient to asses the
dynamical significance of gas. ALMA should place much tighter constraints (See
>Chap. 9 by
Moro-Martin).

5.1.6 Numerical Simulations of Low-Mass Planet Formation
Analytic estimates provide a good understanding of each piece of the planet formation process.
However, putting the whole set of processes into a coherent theory requires numerical calcula-
tions. Clusters of computers can now finish an end-to-end calculation in a reasonable amount
of time. Several groups are building toward this simulation, but no complete calculation exists.
Constructing numerical simulations of planet formation involves identifying and solving
a set of coupled differential equations which describe the evolution of the gaseous disk and
the masses and orbital properties of solid objects. Selecting the proper approach depends on
the nature of the problem. Hydrodynamics codes address the evolution of the gaseous disk
and how planets accrete material and migrate within the disk (D’Angelo et al. 2003; Nelson
and Papaloizou 2004). Smooth particle hydrodynamics allows detailed solutions to outcomes
of binary collisions between large protoplanets (e.g., Earth-Moon and Pluto-Charon formation;
Canup 2008, 2011). Solving the coagulation equation with a fragmentation algorithm yields the
mass and time evolution of solid particles ranging in size from 1 μm up to roughly 1,000 km
(Safronov 1969; Wetherill and Stewart 1993; Kenyon and Luu 1999; Birnstiel et al. 2010). To
treat the dynamical evolution of large planets, N-body treatments provide accurate and often
fast solutions (Chambers and Wetherill 1998; Chambers 2001; Raymond et al. 2004; Nagasawa
et al. 2005; Kokubo et al. 2006).
Most investigations of terrestrial planet formation employ a coagulation code or an N-body
code. An N-body code cannot possibly follow the trajectories of the ≳small planetesimals
expected in a MMSN. Coagulation models, which treat planetesimals as a statistical ensemble
of objects with a distribution of e and i, can solve for the time evolution of their masses and
orbits throughout runaway and oligarchic growth (Wetherill and Stewart 1993). Once most of
the solid mass is in a few protoplanets, the statistical approach fails. N-body codes can then
follow the evolution during the late stages of oligarchic growth and throughout chaotic growth.
Several hybrid codes combine aspects of both approaches (Spaute et al. 1991; Weiden-
schilling et al. 1997; Bromley and Kenyon 2006; Charnoz and Morbidelli 2007; Raymond et al.
2011). To follow the evolution of the gaseous disk together with the solids, Bromley and Kenyon
(2011) solve the radial diffusion equation for the gaseous disk ( > 1.13) and employ a merged
coagulation + N-body code for the solids. In these treatments, the coagulation code follows
solids with masses smaller than the promotion mass, mpro; the N-body code tracks protoplan-
ets with m > mpro. Comparisons with other simulations and with analytic theory provide tests
of these techniques (e.g., Kenyon and Luu 1998; Fraser 2009; Morbidelli et al. 2009b).
To illustrate the formation process, we summarize results for several calculations of terres-
trial planets and gas giant cores. Because this aspect of this field is growing so rapidly, we focus
on a few simple examples.
Coagulation codes begin with an ensemble of planetesimals in place at t = 0 (Kenyon and
Bromley 2010). Planetesimals are placed in concentric annuli according to a fixed initial surface
density relation. These planetesimals often have a single size of 1–100 km; sometimes calcu-
lations begin with a distribution of sizes. Because dynamical friction efficiently damps the
velocities of the largest planetesimals, planets grow faster in calculations with a size distribu-
tion of planetesimals. Starting with an ensemble of small planetesimals leads to faster growth
than an ensemble of large planetesimals. The initial surface density sets the growth time. Planets
grow faster in more massive disks. In many calculations, the planetesimals evolve in a gaseous
disk which also evolves in time; the disk evolution may be proscribed in advanced or calculated
along with the planetesimals.

⊡Fig. 1-8
Evolution of oligarchs in the terrestrial zone. The calculation starts with 1-km planetesimals
(ρ●= 3 g cm−3) in a disk with Σs = 8 g cm−2 (a/1 AU)−1. Left panel: The time evolution of semimajor
axis shows three phases that start at the inner edge of the grid and propagate outward: (1) after
runaway growth, isolated oligarchs with m ≳4 × 1025 g form and continue to grow very rapidly;
(2) oligarchs develop eccentric orbits, collide, and merge; and (3) a few massive oligarchs eventu-
ally contain most of the mass and develop roughly circular orbits. The legend indicates masses (in
M⊕) for the largest oligarchs. Right panel: The mass evolution of oligarchs shows an early phase of
runaway growth (steep tracks) and a longer phase of oligarchic growth (ﬂatter tracks), which cul-
minates in a chaotic phase where oligarchs grow by captures of other oligarchs (steps in tracks).
Despite the steeper appearance of some of the mass tracks during runaway growth, protoplanets
grow more rapidly during oligarchic growth
>Figure 1-8 shows the evolution of oligarchs in an evolutionary sequence starting with an
ensemble of 1-km planetesimals at 0.4–2 AU. Following a short runaway growth phase, proto-
planets with m ≳mpro appear in a wave that propagates out through the planetesimal grid. As
these oligarchs continue to accrete planetesimals, dynamical friction maintains their circular
orbits, and they evolve into “isolated” protoplanets. Eventually, large oligarchs start to interact
dynamically at the inner edge of the grid; a wave of chaotic interactions then moves out through
the disk until all oligarchs interact dynamically. Once a few large oligarchs contain most of the
mass in the system, dynamical friction between the oligarchs and a few leftover planetesimals
starts to circularize their orbits. This process excites the lower mass oligarchs and leftover plan-
etesimals, which are slowly accreted by the largest oligarchs. At the end of the calculation, the
masses, semimajor axes, and orbital eccentricities of stable planets are similar to those of the
terrestrial planets in the solar system.
Comparisons between the results of hybrid and N-body calculations show the importance
of including planetesimals in the evolution. Both approaches produce a few terrestrial mass
planets in roughly circular orbits. Because dynamical friction between leftover planetesimals
and the largest oligarchs is significant, hybrid calculations produce planets with more circular
orbits than traditional N-body calculations. In most hybrid calculations, lower mass planets
have more eccentric orbits than the most massive planets, as observed in the solar system.
In both approaches, the final masses of the planets grow with the initial surface density; the
number of planets is inversely proportional to the initial surface density of solid planetesimals.
However, the overall evolution is faster in hybrid calculations: oligarchs start to interact earlier
and produce massive planets faster.

Evolution of debris disks in the terrestrial zone (Kenyon and Bromley 2004b, 2005). For an A-type
star with a luminosity of ∼50 L⊙, the range in blackbody temperatures of planetesimals at 3–20 AU
(425–165 K) is similar to the range in the solar system at 0.4–2 AU (440–200 K). Left panel: Images

debris disk at 0.4–2-AU disk relative to the mid-IR ﬂux from a G-type star. The dark gray line shows
the evolution for the A-star disk shown in the left panel
In hybrid calculations, the isolation mass and the number of oligarchs are more important
as local quantities than as global quantities. As waves of runaway, oligarchic, and chaotic growth
propagate from the inner disk to the outer disk, protoplanets growing in the inner disk become
isolated at different times compared to protoplanets growing in the outer disk. Thus, the iso-
lation mass in hybrid models is a function of heliocentric distance, initial surface density, and
time, which differs from the classical definition ( > 1.73).
During oligarchic growth of the simulation in >Fig. 1-8, viscous stirring excites leftover
planetesimals to the disruption velocity. A series of separate simulations demonstrates that the
collisional cascade produces copious amounts of dust, which absorb and scatter radiation from
the central star. Following the growth of protoplanets, the cascade begins at the inner edge of
the disk and moves outward. For calculations with a solar-type central star, it takes ∼0.1 Myr
for dust to form throughout the terrestrial zone (0.4–2 AU). The timescale is ∼1 Myr for the
terrestrial zone of an A-type star (3–20 AU). As the collisional cascade proceeds, protoplan-
ets impose structure on the disk (> Fig. 1-9, left panel). Bright rings form along the orbits of
growing protoplanets; dark bands indicate where a large protoplanet has swept up dust along its
orbit. In some calculations, the dark bands are shadows, where optically thick dust in the inner
disk prevents starlight from shining on the outer disk (Grogan et al. 2001; Kenyon and Bromley
2004a; Durda et al. 2004).
In the terrestrial zones of A-type and G-type stars, the dust emits mostly at mid-IR wave-
lengths. In calculations with G-type central stars, formation of a few lunar mass objects at
0.4–0.5 AU leads to copious dust production in a few thousand years (>Fig. 1-9, right panel).
As protoplanets form farther out in the disk, the disk becomes optically thick and the mid-IR
excess saturates. Once the orbits of oligarchs start to overlap (∼1 Myr), the largest objects sweep
the disk clear of small planetesimals. The mid-IR excess fades. During this decline, occasional

46 1
From Disks to Planets
large collisions generate large clouds of debris that produce remarkable spikes in the mid-IR
excess (Kenyon and Bromley 2002, 2005).
In A-type stars, the terrestrial zone lies at greater distances than in G-type stars. Thus, debris
formation in calculations with A-type stars begins later and lasts longer than in models with
G-type stars (>Fig. 1-9, right panel). Because the disks in A-type stars contain more mass, they
produce larger mid-IR excesses. At later times, individual collisions play a smaller role, which
leads to a smoother evolution in the mid-IR excess with time. Although the statistics for G-type
stars is incomplete, current observations suggest that mid-IR excesses are larger for A-type stars
than for G-type stars (See
>Chap. 9 by Moro-Martin).
Collisional cascades and debris disk formation may impact the final masses of terrestrial
planets. Throughout oligarchic growth, roughly ∼25–50% of the initial mass in planetesimals
is converted into debris. For solar-type stars, the disk is optically thick, so oligarchs probably
accrete the debris before some combination of gas drag, Poynting-Robertson drag, and radi-
ation pressure removes it. In the disks of A-type stars, the debris is more optically thin. Thus,
these systems may form lower mass planets per unit surface density than disks surrounding less
massive stars. Both of these assertions require tests with detailed numerical calculations.
5.2 Accretion of Atmospheres
Protoplanetary atmospheres have a rather different character than the mature planetary atmo-
spheres of solar system planets and exoplanets. The crucial distinction is that protoplanets orbit
within a gas disk. The disk supplies the atmosphere’s gas and provides an external binding pres-
sure until the planet opens a clean gap. The protoplanetary atmospheres inherit its composition
from the disk. However, the fraction of heavyelementsthat wind up in the core – versusthe dust
and ablated planetesimals that remain in the atmosphere – is a key uncertainty. This uncertainty
crucially affects the mean molecular weight, μ, and opacity, κ, of the atmosphere.
5.2.1 Static Protoplanet Atmospheres
As protoplanets grow, they become massive enough to bind a gaseous atmosphere. The atmo-
sphere is significantly denser than the surrounding disk gas when the core’s gravitational
binding energy exceeds the thermal energy of the gas. For a solid core of mass mc and radius
rc, this occurs when rB > rc, where the Bondi radius
rB = Gm/c

(1.85)
where total planet mass m = mc + ma, including the gravitationally bound atmosphere’s

As the core mass increases beyond mB, the atmosphere becomes denser and more massive.
The outer boundary of the atmosphere, rout = min(rB, RH), is set by the Bondi radius until the

Comparing to the disk’s gas scale-height Hg = cs/Ω, the criteria rB > Hg and RH > Hg also
reproduce ( > 1.87) within order unity constants (mtrans increases by /for the RH > Hg
criterion). Thus, when m > mtrans, the protoplanet is no longer uniformly embedded in the
disk midplane. It can feel the top and bottom of the disk and start to open a gap (See
>Chap. 2
by Morbidelli). Outside ∼5 AU, the core accretion instability generally occurs for m < mtrans.
Thus, the 3D structure of the gas disk can usually be ignored when describing the onset of core
accretion ( >Sect. 5.2.3) but not its final evolution ( >Sect. 5.2.4).

Wherever radiative diffusion would satisfy the Schwarzschild criterion, d ln T/d ln P > ∇ad,
the energy transport becomes convective. The adiabatic index ∇ad = /for an ideal diatomic
gas but in general must be determined from detailed equation-of-state calculations (Saumon
et al. 1995; Saumon and Guillot 2004). Because convective transport is efficient, the temperature
profile follows an adiabat, T ∝P∇ad, instead of ( > 1.90) in convective regions. For the ideal
gas equation of state, P = ρRT, with the (specific) gas constant R = kB/μmH.
The masses of stable atmospheres (that do not undergo the core accretion instability) place
interesting constraints on planet formation. In the terrestrial zone, typical isolation masses
( > 1.73) are roughly 0.1 M⊕. For almost any accretion time, these planets have stable atmo-
spheres with masses much smaller than the planet’s mass. Icy planets formed at tens of AU,
however, have much larger isolation masses of several M⊕and can support much more massive
atmospheres. In the solar system, the dichotomy between terrestrial planets with thin atmo-
spheres and icy planets with massive atmospheres is consistent with our estimates. Once we
have a large sample of rocky/icy exoplanets with well-characterized atmospheres, we will see if
the same dichotomy persists.

From Disks to Planets
For Mars-mass planets and larger, the radius of the atmosphere is ten or more times larger than
the radius of the core. Extended atmospheres can significantly enhance planetesimal accretion.
When a planetesimal encounters the atmosphere of a protoplanet, it experiences enhanced
gas drag. Capture results if the planetesimal loses enough orbital energy. A thin atmosphere
has little impact on very large planetesimals; the collisional cross section is still πrfg. For suf-
ficiently small planetesimals, any encounter with the atmosphere allows the planet to capture
the planetesimal; the collisional cross section is then πr
out fg. For intermediate sizes, the effec-
tive cross section lies somewhere between πrfg and πr
out fg. To address this regime, Inaba and
Ikoma (2003) define an “enhanced radius” re, where the collisional cross section is πr
e fg. In
this approach, re = r for accreting very large planetesimals, and re = rout for accreting very
small planetesimals. However, very small rocks and dust grains will be too tightly coupled to
the gas to accrete.
Compared to the estimates for dispersion- and shear-dominated growth in > Sect. 5.1,
atmospheres can enhance accretion rates by 1–2 orders of magnitude (Chambers 2008). When
leftover small planetesimals have typical radii of 0.1–10 km, an isolated terrestrial planet with a
thin atmosphere has a small radius enhancement, re ≈−. Thus, these isolated objects never
experience rapid growth from an enhanced radius. Isolated icy planets are more massive and
support massive atmospheres. These objects have re ≈10 for accreting 0.1–10-km planetesimals
and re ≈3 for accreting 100+-km planetesimals. Once they develop atmospheres, icy isolated
objects rapidly sweep up any leftover planetesimals along their orbits.
5.2.3 The Core Accretion Instability
Low-mass protoplanets (near mB) have low-mass, optically thin atmospheres. More massive
cores bind thicker atmospheres, which trap the heat of planetesimal accretion. As the heat
is radiated away, the atmosphere becomes denser and more massive. When the atmosphere’s
mass exceeds roughly the core mass, the atmosphere cannot maintain hydrostatic equilibrium
and collapses (Harris 1978; Mizuno 1980). This collapse – referred to as the “core accretion
instability” – leads to rapid gas accretion and the birth of a gas giant. The critical core mass
(sometimes called the “crossover mass” because collapse occurs when the core and atmosphere
masses roughly match) for this instability is often, but not always, ∼M⊕(Ikoma et al. 2000;
Rafikov 2006).
Near the crtical core mass, real protoplanetary atmospheres are convective in the interior
and (for low enough planetesimal accretion rates) radiative in the exterior region that matches
onto the disk (Rafikov 2006). However, an illustrative, and historically important, calculation by
Stevenson (1982) demonstrates the essential features of the core accretion instability by (incor-
rectly) assuming the atmosphere is completely radiative with constant opacity κ. We summarize
this calculation before comparing it to more detailed computations.
Following Stevenson (1982), we calculate the structure and mass in the atmosphereby keep-
ing the mass, m, constant in the hydrostatic balance equation ( > 1.88), that is, neglecting the
detailed variation from m = mc at the core to m = mc + ma at the top. > Equation 1.88
and > 1.90 then give (temporarily omitting order unity coefficients for clarity)
TdT/dP ∼κL/(σGm) .

To integrate this equation, we assume (correctly) that P and T are significantly higher at the base
of the atmosphere than in the disk. We further keep L constant, appropriate if accreted planetes-
imals release their kinetic energy at the core’s surface. This assumption yields L = Gmc ˙m/rc,
where ˙m is the planetesimal accretion rate. The slowing of planetesimals as they fall through
the atmosphere is a minor correction included in detailed numerical models.

5Our values differ slightly from Stevenson (1982) because we assume constant accretion time instead of
constant mass accretion rate. Further the 3/4 exponent in his Eq. 15 is a typo that should be 3/7.

From Disks to Planets
This simple derivation at least qualitatively explains many features of more detailed core
accretion models. The strong dependence of the atmospheric mass on μ is supported by studies
showing that envelope pollution lowers the critical core mass (Hori and Ikoma 2011). The opac-
ity is very sensitive to the amount and sizes of dust grains (Pollack et al. 1985). One popular way
to speed up core accretion is to reduce the opacity (Hubickyj et al. 2005). The “correct” choice of
opacitylikelyvaries between planets and is poorlyconstrained. It is unclearhow much dust from
ablated planetesimals will remain in the atmosphere. Small grains both contribute significantly
to opacity and settle slowly.
High planetesimal accretion rates increase the critical core mass. For very high accretion
rates, especially in the inner disk, the protoplanet atmosphere will be fully convective (Rafikov
2006). The atmosphere then matches onto the same adiabat (constant entropy curve) as the
disk gas and thus has the lowest possible mass. In this case the formation of gas giants is quite
unlikely. If planetesimal accretion stops (or becomes suitably small), the relevant luminosity
comes from the Kelvin-Helmoltz contraction of the atmosphere. Models that omit planetesimal
accretion (but correctly compute contraction) thus provide a meaningful lower limit on the
critical core mass (Papaloizou and Nelson 2005).
It has long been postulated that the cores of solar system giants might correspond to an iso-
lation mass, ∼5–20 M⊕, at 5–10 AU, even though this would require a massive planetesimal disk
(Pollack et al. 1996). To understand why this assumption is reasonable, we turn to >Fig. 1-10.
Initially a low-mass planet accretes planetesimals rapidly. With a short accretion time, the puffy
atmosphere is well below the crossover mass. As the core grows in mass, two effects bring the
atmosphere closer to instability, (1) extra compression of the gas and (2) fewer and fewer plan-
etesimals to accrete and heat the atmosphere. As the atmosphere cools, the critical core mass
drops until it reaches the actual core mass. This cooling is most likely to happen after most
planetesimals have been accreted, that is, at the isolation mass.

5.2.4 Direct Accretion of Disk Gas (and How it Stops)
When the envelope collapses, the planet starts to accrete gas directly from the protostellar disk.
This dynamical process is not amenable to a stellar structure calculation. Direct accretion of gas
is similar to accretion of planetesimals by oligarchs; the accretion rate is roughly the product of
the planet’s cross section (or impact parameter in the 2D limit), the local gas density (or surface
density), and the encounter velocity, which is dominated by Keplerian shear for circular orbits.
Shortly after the core accretion instability, the planet crosses the transition mass ( > 1.87),
and the relevant accretion radius is the Hill radius, RH. Since the transition mass also corre-
sponds to the Hill radius exceeding the gas scale height (see discussion after ( >1.87)), accretion
is not at the classic Bondi rate (e.g., Shu 1992). Instead the two-dimensional mass accretion rate
applies,

Clearly, something must stop this influx of gas. The gaseous isolation mass is one natural

While this result appears plausible for Jupiter, most disk models for Jupiter’s core require F ≳,
requiring a second mechanism to halt gas accretion (Lissauer et al. 2009).
Opening a gap in the disk – which begins when ( > 1.87) is satisfied – can slow down
accretion so that the disk dissipates before the planet reaches the gaseous isolation mass. Since
disk lifetimes are at least at least 1–3Myr, accretion times must be at least this slow tohalt growth
(without invoking a fine-tuning of core accretion and disk dissipation timescales). Only a wide
and relatively clean gap can slow accretion enough to explain final planet masses (D’Angelo
and Lubow 2008). The effective viscosity of the disk must be low for a clean gap, which is an
especially strong concern for self-gravitating disks (Kratter et al. 2010b, >Sect. 5.3).
5.2.5 Numerical Simulations of Gas Giant Planet Formation
To conclude this section, >Fig. 1-11 illustrates the evolution of the semimajor axes of icy and
gas giant planets from one simulation of material outside the terrestrial zone (e.g., Bromley
and Kenyon 2011). The calculation begins with a single 1,000-km planetesimal and an ensem-
ble of ∼1-cm planetesimals in each of 96 annuli from 3 to 30 AU. Because the system has large
gravitational focusing factors at t = , each large planetesimal rapidly sweeps up the small
planetesimals along its orbit. With growth times proportional to the orbital period ( > 1.72a),
protoplanets at 3–7 AU grow much fasterthan those at larger a. Growth produces many isolated
mass objects packed closely together. Early on, gravitational interactions among these objects
jostle them around into overlapping orbits. After ∼0.3 Myr, the most massive of these proto-
planets begin to scatter lower mass protoplanets to smaller and larger a. Scattered protoplanets
sweep up and scatter the large preexisting planetesimals in these orbits, accelerating the growth

Orbital evolution of icy oligarchs. The calculation starts with 1-cm and 1,000-km planetesimals
(ρ●= 1.5 g cm−3) in a disk with initial Σs = 14 g cm−2 (a/3 AU)−1e−a/30 AU. Duringthe ﬁrst 3×105 year,
∼20 oligarchswithm ≈0.05 M⊕form in a relatively narrow range of semimajor axis, 3–7 AU. Asthey
grow, more massive oligarchs scatter lower mass oligarchs to large semimajor axes, a ≈1–20 AU. At
∼1 Myr, some oligarchs begin to accrete gas. Over the next 10 Myr, continued growth and scatter-
ing lead to collisions and mergers of oligarchs. Eventually, only a few oligarchs remain. The largest
of these have masses comparable to the mass of Jupiter. The legend indicates masses (in M⊕) for
the largest oligarchs in stable orbits around the central star
of all large protoplanets. At ∼1 Myr, the largest protoplanets begin to accrete gas from the disk.
As they grow, they scatter lower mass protoplanets to larger and larger a; eventually, they eject
some of these low-mass protoplanets from the planetary system.
At the end of the calculation at 100 Myr, six planets remain on stable orbits. Two gas giants,
with 1 and 3 Jupiter masses, have a = 5 and 10 AU. Inside these gas giants, a super-Earth with
m ≈M⊕lies on a fairly circular orbit, e ≈0.02 at a ≈1.5 AU. Outside the gas giants, two more
super-Earths occupy orbits in a 2:1 resonance. After many exchanges, the orbits of these two
planets are likely stable. Finally, a planet with roughly 1.5 times the mass of Saturn rests in an
orbit with modest eccentricity, e ≈0.1 at a ≈50 AU. The outcome of this simulation combines
some properties of the solar system – four gas giants at 5–30 AU – along with some properties
of known exoplanets, – a super-Earth at 1–2 AU.
This example illustrates several important differences between terrestrial and gas giant
planet formation:
•
Oligarchs form at 1 AU before they form at 5 AU. From ( > 1.72a), the growth time scales
with the orbital period and the enhancement of the surface density at the snow line. Com-
paring timescales at 0.4 and at 4 AU, we expect a factor of ∼300 from the orbital period and
a factor of 1/2.4 from the snow line enhancement. The factor of ∼10 ratio of growth times
at 0.4 and 4 AU in the simulations agrees well with expectations.

Oligarchs reach chaotic growth faster at 5 AU than at 1 AU. From the discussion
in >Sect. 5.1.2, icy oligarchs at 5 AU have larger isolation masses than rocky oligarchs at
1 AU ( >1.73). Thus, their gravitational interactions are stronger and lead to chaotic growth
sooner.

While rocky planets scatter low-mass protoplanets a few tenths of an AU, gas giant plan-
ets scatter some low-mass protoplanets close to the host star and eject many others from
the planetary system. Fortunately, the solar system avoided either outcome. However,
many exoplanets close to their host stars have large e. Although orbital migration prob-
ably accounts for exoplanets with small a and nearly circular orbits (See
> Chap. 2 by

From Disks to Planets 1

Morbidelli), producing super-Earths with a ≲0.4 AU and e ≳0.1 probably requires planet-
planet scattering, as in >Fig. 1-11 (Juri´c and Tremaine 2008; Raymond et al. 2011). In a few
years, exoplanet statistics will allow critical tests of the ability of migration and scattering to
explain the observed (a, e) distribution.
5.3 Direct Formation of Brown Dwarfs and Gas Giants
Though the core accretion is remarkably successful at explaining the diversity of planetary sys-
tems, it cannot be proved. It is thus useful to develop alternate theories. Ideally each theory
would make testable predictions, but consistency with physics and existing astronomical obser-
vations also provides stringent constraints. Here we consider the leading alternate theory that
a gravitationally unstable gas disk might fragment into bound objects that survive as gas giant
planets (Kuiper 1951; Cameron 1978; Bodenheimer et al. 1980; Boss 2000). This theory should
not be confused with the hypothesis that the solid component of the proplanetary disk gravi-
tationally collapses into planetesimals (Safronov 1969; Goldreich and Ward 1973; Youdin and
Shu 2002, >Sect. 4.2).
>Sect. 3.6 introduced the idea that disks are gravitationally unstable when the Toomre
(1964) criterion,
Q =
csΩ
πGΣg
≲,
(1.101)
is satisfied for a surface mass density, Σ. There, we outlined basic constraints on the accretion
rate and temperature for stable disks. For a fragment to survive, it must cool quickly, so that it
contracts on an orbital timescale. Analytic theory suggests bound fragments are possible but
have the typical masses of brown dwarfs (Rafikov 2005; Kratter et al. 2010b); so far, numerical
simulations are inconclusive (D’Angelo et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2010).
To outline the basic issues for gravitational instability, we consider a density perturbation
in a disk which satisfies the Toomre Q criterion. For this fragment to continue to contract, it
must cool on a sufficiently short timescale (Gammie 2001),
tc < ξΩ−.
(1.102)
For likely conditions within a protoplanetary disk, numerical simulations suggest that the crit-
ical value of ξ ≈3 (Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2003), with uncertainties due to the equation of
state and the opacity. Fragments that cannot cool on the orbital timescale will be sheared apart.
For the cooling time in a viscous disk with an α-viscosity ( >1.23), this constraint places a limit
on α:
α ≳/[ξγ(γ −)] ∼..
(1.103)
Fragmenting disks also have very high accretion rates.
For the inner disk (R < 10 AU), combining the Toomre (Q ≲) and cooling criteria yields
fragments only in hot, massive disks (Rafikov 2005; Matzner and Levin 2005). With disk masses
comparable to the stellar mass, these conditions probably produce a bound stellar companion
instead of a lower mass planet. Although colder, lower mass disks can have Q ≲; their slow
cooling times do not allow the fragment to survive.
Forming planet-mass fragments in the outer disk, at 50–100 AU, is more attractive.
Irradiation (instead of viscous transport) then dominates the energy budget of the disk

56 1
From Disks to Planets
(D’Alessio et al. 1998). Although estimates for the cooling time are more complicated, an irra-
diated disk is thought to fragment more readily once it reaches Q ≲(Rice et al. 2011; Kratter
and Murray-Clay 2011).
In any part of the disk, the initial mass of a gravitational fragment is typically ∼ΣgH
g in
terms of the disk scale-height Hg. For the most optimistic assumptions about cooling – specif-
ically that the optical depth τ = – fragment masses are ≳MJ at 100 AU (Rafikov 2005).
Less efficient cooling (τ ≠) and closer orbital separations increase the fragment mass. These
minimum masses require very cold disks (T ≲K), which might be achievable in the outer
portions of disks in low-mass star-forming regions like Ophiuchus (Andrews et al. 2009).
While making a fragment with a mass below ∼MJ is challenging, keeping the fragment
mass low is an even more difficult problem. Disks are likely to fragment before infall from the
surrounding molecular cloud ceases. Preventing the disk fragment from accreting this infalling
mass is a challenge. As explained in >Sect. 5.2.4, stopping the flow of disk gas onto a planet
requires a low-mass and fairly quiescent disk, exactly opposite to the conditions required for
an unstable disk. Kratter et al. (2010b) quantify these issues and conclude that disks in nearby
star-forming regions are more likely to produce 25–75-MJ brown dwarfs than 1–10-MJ planets.
The mass problem might be helped if fragmentscool just rapidly enough to remain bound. Then
if they migrate inward, they would overflow their Roche lobes and be “tidally downsized” (Boley
et al. 2010; Nayakshin 2010). This intriguing suggestion cannot yet be considered a solution.
Even if bound Jupiter-mass fragments form, understanding the time evolution of frag-
ments within a Q ∼disk requires sophisticated numerical calculations. In smooth particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), an ensemble of particles represents the gas; each particle has a set of
physical properties and responds to gravity, radiation pressure, and other forces (Benz et al.
1986; Monaghan 1992). Grid-based calculations lay out a set of points where the physical con-
ditions of the gas are specified; solving a set of coupled differential equations yields the time
evolution of the conditions at each point (Black and Bodenheimer 1975; Tohline 1980; Pickett
et al. 1998).
In both approaches, disks close to the stability limit develop multiarm spiral structure
(Kratter et al. 2010a; Mayer et al. 2002). Spiral modes generate turbulence throughout the disk
(Nelson et al. 1998; Gammie 2001). The large amplitudes of these modes create a rippled surface
above the disk midplane (Durisen et al. 2001). When the cooling rate is near the critical value
ξ, the spiral structure maintains a rough equilibrium, where the amplitude of the spiral modes
increases as the cooling rate declines (Mejía et al. 2005; Cai et al. 2006).
When the cooling time is smaller than the local rotational period, as in ( > 1.102), the disk
fragments (Gammie 2001; Johnson and Gammie 2003; Rice et al. 2003). For astrophysically rel-
evant conditions, fragmentation requires the disk mass be at least 10% of the stellar mass. As
the disk mass grows, spiral waves propagate throughout the disk. Within a few rotation periods,
fragments form in the densest portions of the spirals (Boley et al. 2010). If the fragments con-
tinue to cool rapidly, they grow in mass and become bound objects; otherwise, they are sheared
apart (Mayer et al. 2004).
The long-term evolution of bound fragments in self-gravitating disks is unclear. Because the
numerical calculations involve such a wide range of scales, none can evolve a bound fragment
long enough to determineits final fate. If the cooling time is short, and accretion from the disk is
inefficient, bound fragments could become gas giant planets or more likely brown dwarfs. Such
objects might also grow to full-fledged stellar companions (Bonnell and Bate 1994). Overcom-
ing the numerical limits on the calculations requires fastercomputers and innovative techniques
to follow the evolution of fragments in a time-dependent disk.

Summary
In the last decade or two, observations have revolutionized our understanding of planetary
astronomy. In the 1990s, the thrilling discovery of the Kuiper belt nearly doubled the empirical
size of the disk of the solar system (Jewitt and Luu 1993). A few years later, Mayor and Queloz
(1995) discovered an extraordinary exoplanet orbiting only 0.05 AU from the solar-type star
51 Peg. Now, the number of known Kuiper belt objects easily exceeds 1,000, including a grand
variety of dynamical and taxonomic classes that place interesting constraints on the origin and
early evolution of the protosolar nebula (Barucci et al. 2008). Although there are only ∼1,000
confirmed exoplanets, data from Kepler and many ground-based programs will certainly push
the count past 10,000 in the next decade. Some of these will certainly challenge current ideas
about planet formation.
Throughout this onslaught, theorists responded quickly with new ideas (dead zones in disks,
migration, symplectic N-bodycodes) and variants on old ideas (collisional cascades, disk insta-
bilities, multiannulus coagulation codes). Rapid developments in computing hardware fueled
many advances; new analytical approaches drove others.
Today, we have a good basic theory of disk evolution. Despite uncertainties about the initial
mass and temperature distribution and the origin of disk viscosity, analytic and numerical disk
models provide a good framework for interpreting observations and for exploring the origin
of planetary systems. Current research involves combining more elaborate versions of the basic
theory ( >Sect. 3) with detailed models for the chemical evolution of disk material. Within the
next decade, these investigations should improve our insight into the overall evolution of the
disk and the growth and composition of dust grains with sizes ∼1–10 mm.
We alsounderstand how kilometer-sized orlargerplanetesimals become planets ( >Sect. 5).
Although there are major uncertainties about the onset and the end of gas accretion and the
interactions of massive planets with the gas disk, analytic theory and numerical simulations
demonstrate that – on 1–10-Myr timescales – ensembles of planetesimals can evolve into ter-
restrial and gas giant planets within ∼50 AU of the central star. Comparisons of observations
with the predicted masses and orbital properties of planets and the predicted dust masses and
luminosity evolution of debris disks are promising and will eventually produce stringent tests
of the theory.
Despite these successes, we are still in search of a robust theory for planetesimal forma-
tion ( >Sect. 4). Excellent progress on the meter-sized barrier isolates the importance of radial
drift and the problems associated with direct coagulation models. Some type of instability –
either by direct gravitational collapse or a concentration mechanism such as the streaming
instability – seems necessary to produce planetesimals on fast timescales. Larger numerical
simulations will undoubtedly yield a better understanding of these instabilities. Exploring other
physical mechanisms for particle growth and evolution is also essential.
Understanding fragmentation in protostellar disks promises to unify our understanding of
star and planet formation. Although many physical and numerical issues remain unresolved,
fragmentation is a promising way to produce gas giants and brown dwarfs at ≳50–100 AU from
the parent star. Despite the current lack of large samples of planets in this domain, direct imag-
ing surveys are starting to discover 1–30-MJ objects with a ∼10–100 AU (Kalas et al. 2008;
Marois et al. 2008; Lagrange et al. 2010; Currie et al. 2010; Kraus et al. 2011). With large uncer-
tainties in model atmospheres, assessing the formation mechanism of these objects is difficult.
Once large samples of planets and brown dwarfs at 10–100 AU are available, their properties
will allow a robust assessment of the core accretion and disk instability mechanisms.

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
Abstract:
The apparent regularity of the motion of the giant planets of our solar system
suggested for decades that said planets formed onto orbits similar to the current ones and
that nothing dramatic ever happened during their lifetime. The discovery of extrasolar plan-
ets showed astonishingly that the orbital structure of our planetary system is not typical. Many
giant extrasolar planets have orbits with semimajor axes of ∼1 AU, and some have even smaller
orbital radii, sometimes with orbital periods of just a few days. Moreover, most extrasolar plan-
ets have large eccentricities, up to values that only comets have in our solar system. Why is there
such a great diversity between our solar system and the extrasolar systems, as well as among the
extrasolar systems themselves? This chapter aims to give a partial answer to this fundamental
question. Its guideline is a discussion of the evolution of our solar system, certainly biased by a
view that emerges, in part, from a series of works comprising the “Nice model.” According to
this view, the giant planets of the solar system migrated radially while they were still embedded
in a protoplanetary disk of gas and presumably achieved a multi-resonant orbital configura-
tion, characterized by smaller interorbital spacings and smaller eccentricities and inclinations
with respect to the current configuration. The current orbits of the giant planets may have been
achieved during a phase of orbital instability, during which the planets acquired temporarily
large-eccentricity orbits and all experienced close encounters with at least one other planet.
This instability phase occurred presumably during the putative “Late Heavy Bombardment”
of the terrestrial planets, approximately ∼3.9 Gy ago (Tera et al. 1974). The interaction with a
massive, distant planetesimal disk (the ancestor of the current Kuiper belt) eventually damped
the eccentricities of the planets, ending the phase of mutual planetary encounters and parking
the planets onto their current, stable orbits. This new view of the evolution of the solar system
makes our system not very different from the extrasolar ones. In fact, the best explanation for
the large orbital eccentricities of extrasolar planets is that the planets that are observed are the
survivors of strong instability phases of original multi-planet systems on quasi-circular orbits.
The main difference between the solar system and the extrasolar systems is in the magnitude
of such an instability. In the extrasolar systems, encounters among giant planets had to be the
norm. In our case, the two major planets (Jupiter and Saturn) never had close encounters with
each other: They only encountered “minor” planets like Uranus and/or Neptune. This was prob-
ably just mere luck, as simulations show that Jupiter-Saturn encounters in principle could have
occurred. Another relevant difference with the extrasolar planets is that, during the gas-disk
phase, our giant planets avoided migrating permanently into the inner solar system, thanks to
the specific mass ratio of the Jupiter/Saturn pair and the rapid disappearance of the disk soon
after the formation of the giant planets. This chapter ends on a note on terrestrial planets. The
structure of a terrestrial-planet system depends sensitively on the dynamical evolution of the
giant planets and on their final orbits. It appears clear that habitable terrestrial planets, with
moderate eccentricity orbits, cannot exist in systems where the giant planets became violently
unstable and developed very elliptic orbits. Thus, our very existence is possible only because
the instability phase experienced by the giant planets of our solar system was of “moderate”
strength.

Introduction
It is now clear that observed planetary systems did not form in their current configura-
tion, but they have been heavily modified by a nontrivial dynamical evolution. Processes like
planet migration, resonant trapping, planet–planet scattering, mutual collisions, and hyperbolic

ejections have sculpted the structure of planetary systems since the formation of the planets;
some of these processes might also have played a crucial role in the accretion of the planets
themselves. The observational evidence that planetary systems can be very different from each
other suggests that their dynamical evolutions have been very diverse, probably as a result of a
strong sensitivity of the dynamics on environmental parameters or initial conditions.
The goal of this chapter is to review our current understanding of the possible dynamical
evolutions of planetary systems and of the current open problems. The main focus will be on our
solar system, because this is the system that is best modeled,thanks to the vast number of obser-
vational constraints. The dynamical history of our planetary system followed stepwise generic
processes, but was also characterized by a number of specific “events” that act like bifurcation
points in the evolution of planetary systems. Insights are gained by asking what would have
happened if these events had occurred differently, thus helping explain the origin of diversity
in planetary systems.
This chapter is divided in three parts. The first is devoted to the early evolution of giant
planets when they are still embedded in the gas disk, i.e., during the first few millions of years
following the formation of the central star. The second discussesthe evolution of the giant plan-
ets after the disappearance of the gas, when they interact with a still massive planetesimal disk;
this is the era of debris disks, which are commonly observed around stars even as old as 1 Gy.
The third part will focus on terrestrial planets and on how their accretion and evolution depend
on the evolution of the giant planets discussed before.

The Gas-Disk Era
2.1 The Formation of the Giant Planets
There are two possible mechanisms by which giant planets can form. The first is nicknamed
the “core-accretion mechanism”: The coagulation of solid particles forms a core typically of
about ten Earth masses (M⊕) while the gas is still present in the protoplanetary disk; the core
then traps by gravity a massive atmosphere of hydrogen and helium from the disk (Pollack
et al. 1996) and becomes a giant planet. The second mechanism invokes the gravitational insta-
bility of the gaseous component of the disk (Cameron 1978): A cold, massive protoplanetary
disk can break into a number of self-gravitating gas clumps, which then contract forming
giant gaseous planets (Cassen et al. 1981; Boss 2000, 2001, 2002; see Durisen et al. 2007 for a
review).
The debate to discriminate between these two models has been very intense over the last
10 years. Now, several direct orindirect observations suggest that the core-accretion mechanism
is predominant for the formation of the planets detected so far. First, interior structure models
of the giant planets of the solar system predict that all of them have massive solid cores (Guillot
2005; Militzer and Hubbard 2009; however, see Nettelmann et al. 2008 for a model arguing for
a core-less Jupiter). Second, there is a clear correlation between the metallicity of stars and the
probability that said stars have giant planets around them (Fischer and Valenti 2005). Third,
transiting extrasolar planets are inferred to have solid cores whose relative mass is correlated
with the metallicityofthe host star(Guillot et al. 2006). All these features suggest that solids have
a crucial role in giant planet formation, an aspect that is difficult to explain in the framework
of the gravitational instability model (Boss 2002). Moreover, new hydrodynamical simulations
that more accurately model thermodynamics in protoplanetary disks find that the formation of

66 2

long-lived, self-gravitating clumps of gas is likely only at large distances from the central star
(>50–100 AU; Boley 2009). It is still unclear, though, whether the end products of these clumps
can be giant planets or must be brown-dwarf-mass objects (Stamatellos and Whitworth 2008).
Thus, there is a growing consensus that the giant planets observed within a few AUs from
their parent stars formed by the core-accretion process. The planets found at large distances
from their parent stars (for instance, around HR 8799 – Marois et al. 2008 – or Fomalhaut –
Kalas et al. 2008) are the best candidates to be the outcome of the gravitational instability
process. There is still a possibility, though, that they are giant planets formed closer to the star
by core accretion, which subsequently achieved large orbital distances through planet–planet
scattering (Veras et al. 2009) or outward migration (Crida et al. 2009).
The core-accretion model, nevertheless, has its own problems. The main difficulty is under-
standing how a ∼M⊕core could form within a few million years (which is the typical survival
time of a gas disk; Haisch et al. 2001). In the classical view, these cores form by collisional coag-
ulation from a disk of planetesimals (small bodies of sizes and compositions similar to current
asteroids or comets). In this environment, gravity starts to play a fundamental role, bending
the trajectories of the colliding objects; this leads to an effective increase of the collisional cross
section of the bodies by the so-called gravitational focussing factor (Greenzweig and Lissauer
1992). At the beginning, if the planetesimal disk is dynamically very cold (i.e., the orbits have
tiny eccentricities and inclinations), the dispersion velocity of the planetesimals vrel may be
smaller than the escape velocity of the planetesimals themselves. In this case, a process of run-
away growth begins, in which the relative mass growth of each object is an increasing function
of its own mass M, namely,

M
dM
dt ∼M/
v
rel
(Greenberg et al. 1978; Wetherill and Stewart 1989). However, as growth proceeds, the disk
becomes dynamically heated by the scattering action of the largest bodies. When vrel becomes
of the order of the escape velocity from the most massive objects (i.e., vrel ∝M/
big), the runaway
growth phase ends and the accretion proceeds in an oligarchic growth mode, in which the rela-
tive mass growth of the largest objects d log Mbig/dt is proportional to M−/
big
(Ida and Makino
1993; Kokubo and Ida 1998).
In principle, the combination of runaway and oligarchic growths should continue until the
largest objects achieve an isolation mass, which is a substantial fraction of the initial total mass
of local solids. In the outer solar system, beyond the so-called snow line1 (Podolak and Zucker
2004), if the initial disk is sufficiently massive (about ten times the so-called minimal mass
solar nebula or MMSN; Weidenschilling 1977; Hayashi 1981), it is expected that the end result
is the formation of a few super-Earths (Thommes et al. 2003; Goldreich et al. 2004; Chambers
2006), as required in the core-accretion model for giant planet formation. N-body simulations,
though, show that reality is not so simple. When the cores achieve a mass of about 1 M⊕, they
start to scatter the planetesimals away from their neighborhood, instead of accreting them (Ida
and Makino 1993; Levison et al. 2010), which slows their accretion rate significantly.
It has been proposed that gas drag (Wetherill and Stewart 1989) or mutual inelastic col-
lisions (Goldreich et al. 2004) prevent the dispersion of the planetesimals by damping their

situated at about 3–5 AU from a solar-mass star, depending on time and on disk models (Min et al. 2011).

orbital eccentricities, but in this case, the cores open gaps in the planetesimal disk (Levison
and Morbidelli 2007; Levison et al. 2010), like the satellites Pan and Daphnis open gaps in Sat-
urn’s rings. Thus, the cores isolate themselves from the disk of solids. This effectively stops their
growth. It has been argued that planet migration (Alibert et al. 2004) or the radial drift of sub-
km planetesimals due to gas drag (Rafikov 2004) breaks the isolation of the cores from the disk
of solids, but, again, N-body simulations show that the relative drift of planetesimals and cores
simply collects the former in resonances with the latter (Levison et al. 2010); this prevents the
planetesimals from being accreted by the cores. In fact, only planetesimals smaller than a few
tens of meters drift in the disk fast enough to avoid trapping in any resonance with a grow-
ing core (Weidenschilling and Davis 1985). Lambrechts and Johansen (2012) argued that, if the
mass in the disk is originally dominated by pebbles of a few decimeters, the largest planetesi-
mals formed by the streaming instability process (Johansen et al. 2009) would keep accreting
pebbles very efficiently, rapidly growing to several Earth masses.
In summary, the accretion of massive cores is still an open problem. A key uncertainty with
synthetic models is that simple formulæ for the mass growth of the cores are made up to achieve
the desired result, without any correspondence with the outcomes of N-body simulations
(which should be considered as a sort of “ground truth” for dynamical processes).
Another problem of the core-accretion model originates from Type I migration. Type I
migration is the label denoting the radial drift of planetary cores (with masses ranging from
that of Mars to several Earth masses) due to their gravitational interaction with the gaseous
component of the disk. Analytic and numerical studies have shown that a planetary core gen-
erates a spiral density wave in the disk (Goldreich and Tremaine 1979, 1980; Ward 1986, 1997;
Tanaka et al. 2002). In the outer part of the disk, the wave trails the core. Thus, the gravitational
attraction that the wave exerts on the core results in a negative torque that slows the core down.
In the inner part of the disk, the wave leads the core, and therefore it exerts on it an acceleration
torque. The net effect on the core depends on the balance between these two torques of oppo-
site signs. Ward (1997) showed that in general cases, i.e., for disks with power-law radial density
profiles, the negative torque exerted by the wave in the outer disk wins. Consequently, the core
has to lose angular momentum, and its orbit shrinks: The planetary core migrates toward the
central star, with a speed:
da/dt ∝MpΣg(a/H),
where a is the orbital radius of the planet, Mp is its mass, Σg is the surface density of the gas
disk, and H is its height at the distance a from the central star.
Precise calculations show that an Earth-mass body at 1 AU, in a MMSN with scale height
H/a = %, migrates into the star in 200,000 year. Thus, planetary cores should fall onto the
central star well before they can attain the mass required to capture a massive atmosphere and
become giant planets.
Several mechanisms that might weaken or prevent Type I migration have been investi-
gated. First, turbulence may turn inward Type I migration into a random walk (Nelson and
Papaloizou 2003; Nelson 2005), which could save at least some of the cores. Second, if there is a
steep positive dΣg/da at some location in the disk, for instance, at the outer edge of a partially
depleted central cavity, inward Type I migration should stop there (Masset et al. 2006). Finally,
it has been recently shown that migration can be outward in the inner part of the disk, which
transports and dissipates heat inefficiently due to its large opacity (Paardekooper and Mellema
2006; Baruteau and Masset 2008; Kley and Crida 2008; Paardekooper et al. 2010; Masset and

68 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
Casoli 2010; Bitsch and Kley 2011). In this case, all cores would migrate toward an intermediate
region of the disk, where Type I migration is effectively erased (Lyra et al. 2010).
A particularly puzzling aspect of the core-accretion process is the evidence that in our solar
system, massive cores of ∼M⊕formed in the giant planets region, whereas in the inner solar
system, the planetary embryos resulting from the runaway/oligarchic growth process presum-
ably had masses smaller than the mass of Mars (Wetherill and Stewart 1993; Wetherill 1992;
Weidenschilling 1977). This jump of two orders of magnitude in the masses of embryos/cores
from the inner to the outer solar system is difficult to understand. In fact, the surface density
of solids in the disk should have had a “jump” at the snow line of only a factor of ∼2, given
the revised solar C/O abundance (Lodders 2003). Moreover, the orbital frequency (that sets the
speed of all dynamical processes, including accretion) decreases with increasing distance from
the star.
So, what makes the outer solar system so favorable for the formation of massive cores? To
answer this question, several investigators searched for mechanisms that can concentrate a large
amount of solids (well above the initial surface density) in some localized region of the disk,
so to achieve a sweet spot for the formation of a massive object. Some proposed mechanisms
still give a pivotal role to the snow line (Morfill and Voelk 1984; Ida and Lin 2008), but others
are based on the concentration of boulders in long-lived vortices (Barge and Sommeria 1995;
Lyra et al. 2009a, b) or on halting migration of planetary embryos at a given orbital radius
(Masset et al. 2006; Morbidelli et al. 2008a; Paardekooper and Papaloizou 2009; Sándor et al.
2011; Horn et al. 2012), which are independent of the snow line location. Obviously, more work
is needed to understand which mechanism is relevant and dominant. Depending on future
results, it might turn out that the widespread expectation that giant planets form by the core-
accretion mechanism only beyond the snow line is naive; instead, some giant planets might have
formed in the warmer regions of the disk (Bodenheimer et al. 2000).
2.2 Once Giant Planets are Formed: Type II Migration and Its
Consequences
By the action-reaction principle, the torques exerted by the disk onto the planet are symmetri-
cally exerted by the planet onto the disk. Thus, the planet exerts a positive torque onto the outer
disk, i.e., it pushes the outer disk outward, while it exerts a negative torque onto the inner disk,
i.e., it pushes it inward. For small massobjects, such as the planetary cores considered in the pre-
vious section, these torques are overcome by the internal torques of the disk, due to viscosity and
pressure, so that the mass distribution in the disk – averaged over the azimuthal coordinate –
is not significantly affected by the presence of the planet. However, this is no longer true if the
planet is sufficiently massive (several tens of Earth masses for typical values of the disk’s param-
eters); in this case, the internal torques of the disk cannot oppose the torques suffered from the
planet. Consequently, the inner and outer parts of the disk are effectively repelled, and a gap
in the gas distribution opens around the planet’s orbit (Lin and Papaloizou 1986a; Crida et al.
2006).
Once a giant planet has opened a gap in the disk, it is condemned to stay in the middle of
the gap. In fact, if it approached the inner edge of the gap, the distance of the planet from the
inner disk would decrease and that from the outer disk would increase, so that the torque felt
from the inner disk would become stronger than that felt from the outer disk. Thus, the planet
would be pushed back toward the center of the gap. The symmetric situation would occur if the

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems 2
69
planet approached the outer edge of the gap. Consequently, any radial migration of the planet
has to follow the radial migration of the gap. The global evolution of the disk occurs on a viscous
timescale Tν = a/ν, where ν is the disk viscosity (Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974). So, the radial
displacement of the gap and the migration of the planet have to occur on this timescale (Lin and
Papaloizou 1986b). Unless the planet is close to the outer edge of the disk (Veras and Armitage
2004), the planet has to migrate toward the star, because this is the natural direction of evolution
of an accretion disk (Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974; Lin and Papaloizou 1986b). The migration
of a planet associated with a gap is called “Type II migration.”
Type II migration explains in a natural way the presence of giant planets on orbits very close
to the parent stars (Lin et al. 1996), which is a very common characteristic in the population
of extrasolar planets discovered to date. However, in our solar system, the giant planets have
orbital radii of several AUs, comparable to the orbital radii at which said planets are expected
to have formed (see > Sect. 2.1). Moreover, extrasolar planets have also been discovered on
orbits with semimajor axes larger than ∼3 AU. What happened in these cases? Why is Type II
migration sometimes ineffective?.
For our solar system, the key to answer this question seems to be the coexistence of Jupiter
and Saturn, with their specific mass ratio. In fact, hydrodynamical simulations, where Jupiter
and Saturn are simultaneously taken into account with fixed masses, show that Saturn migrates
the fastest, due toit smallermass; therefore, it has notrouble in approaching Jupiteruntil the two
planets are caught in resonance (Masset and Snellgrove 2001) (> Fig. 2-1). In disks with mass
comparable to the MMSN, the most likely end state is the capture in the mutual 2/3 mean-
motion resonance, where the orbital period of Saturn is 1.5 that of Jupiter. This occurs even
if Saturn is initially beyond the 1/2 resonance or locked into the 1/2 resonance (Pierens and
Nelson 2008). Stable capture intothe 1/2 resonance is possible onlyfordisks with surface density
decaying less steeply than 1/r or in low-mass disks (Zhang and Zhou 2010). Once locked in the
2/3 resonance, the inward migration of Jupiter and Saturn stops (Masset and Snellgrove 2001;

Morbidelli and Crida 2007), which explains why Jupiter did not migrate all the way close to the
Sun (>Fig. 2-1). These results hold both for disks with constant viscosity and for the so-called
α-disks (Shakura and Sunyaev 1973) and do not depend critically on the value of the viscosity.
However, things may not be so simple in reality. All the hydrodynamical simulations that
show that Saturn captures Jupiter in resonance assume fixed masses for the planets. A natural
question arises: Is it still reasonable to expect resonance capture if the migration histories of
the planets are coupled with their accretion histories? At first sight, the answer is negative. If
the second planet forms later than the first one, its migration history should just replicate that
of the first planet but later in time. More simply, the second planet should always lag behind
the first one, as it is just repeating the evolution of the first planet, just at a later time. Thus, it
appears that Saturn could catch Jupiter in resonance only if the accretion histories of the two
planets were different. In particular, if Jupiter grew very rapidly to its current mass, it would
have passed very quickly to a Type II migration mode, which is relatively slow. Instead, if Sat-
urn grew more gradually than Jupiter and spent more time near a Saturn mass, it would have
undergone fast migration fora longerperiod and hence could have trapped Jupiterin resonance.
It is unclear why Saturn should have grown more slowly than Jupiter. Possibly, the opacity of
the disk increased from the time of accretion of Jupiter to that of Saturn, thus slowing down the
gas-accretion rate onto the planet.
Interestingly, among the collection of extrasolar planets, there are at least three systems
where the Saturn analog did not capture in resonance the Jupiter analog (HD 12661, HD 13498,
HIP 14810). But in these cases, the inner, more massive planet is closer than 1 AU to the star,
and the outer, lighter planet is more than three times further away. This is obviously very differ-
ent from the orbital architecture of Jupiter and Saturn or of the system OGLE-06-109L (which is
a sort of twin of the Jupiter-Saturn system), which suggests that a different evolution occurred
in these cases. It appears that the capture in resonance between a Jupiter analog and a Sat-
urn analog is an event that may or may not happen, according to the accretion histories of
these planets; depending on this binary possibility, the systems evolve along clearly different
paths.
Assume now that Jupiter and Saturn were captured in their mutual 2/3 resonance. Mor-
bidelli and Crida (2007) showed that the subsequent dynamical evolution of these planets
depends on the properties of the disk, particularly the scale height. For thick disks (about 6% in
scale height for a typical viscosity), the migration is very slow, and the planets remain at effec-
tively constant distance from the central star. But for disks with decreasing thickness, outward
migration becomes increasingly fast. In principle, in thin disks, outward migration can bring
the planets up to ten times further than their initial location in a few thousands orbital peri-
ods (Crida et al. 2009), which might explain the orbits of some of the planets discovered by
direct imaging beyond several tens of AUs from their parent stars. Until now, outward migra-
tion of Jupiter and Saturn from inside ∼4 AU was considered incompatible with the existence
of the asteroid belt – therefore only proto-solar disk models which prohibited outward migra-
tion were considered viable (Morbidelli et al. 2007). However, as shown by Walsh et al. (2011)
and discussed in >Sect. 4.1, this is not true, releasing the constraints against Jupiter’s outward
migration. This opens a new degree of freedom to model the evolution of the solar system, as it
will be shown at the end of this chapter.
For two giant planets to avoid inward migration as discussed above, it is essential that the
mass of the outer planet is a fraction of the mass of the inner planet, as in the Jupiter-Saturn
case (Masset and Snellgrove 2001; Morbidelli and Crida 2007). Consider a heuristic but intu-
itive explanation of this statement. When two giant planets are close enough to each other, they
evolve inside a common gap of the gas-density distribution. The inner planet, being closer to

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems 2
71
the inner edge than to the outer edge of the common gap, feels a positive torque and would tend
to migrate outward; the outer planet, being closer to the outer edge of the common gap, feels
a negative torque and would tend to migrate inward. If the planets are locked in resonance,
their relative orbital separation cannot change (if they are not yet in resonance, they move
toward each other until they are captured and locked into a resonance). Thus, the direction
of migration of the pair of planets depends on which of the two torques dominates. Each torque
is proportional to the surface density of the disk adjacent to the planet and to the square of the
mass of the planet itself (Goldreich and Tremaine 1979). Because the planets partially deplete
the disk in the region between the star and their innermost orbit (a partial cavity; Crida and
Morbidelli 2007), the surface density in the outer disk is typically larger than in the inner disk;
so, a necessary condition to avoid inward migration (i.e., to make the torque felt by the inner
planet larger than that felt by the outer planet) is that the inner planet is more massive.
Therefore, this mechanism predicts that no pair of resonant giant planets with narrow
orbital separation, with the outer planet significantly lighter than the inner one, should ever be
found close to the parent star. In fact, planets in this configuration should have avoided inward
migration. So far, this prediction is validated by observation. In fact, there are many pairs of
planets in resonance (orclose to), neartheirstar, but none ofthese cases exhibits a Jupiter/Saturn
mass ratio. The absence of this configuration, which is statistically significant if one assumes that
the mass ratio should be random, strongly supports the theoretical result that resonant planets
in Jupiter/Saturn mass ratio move outward, and therefore cannot be found within the range of
stellar distances that can be probed by radial velocity observations (OGLE-06-109L system was
in fact discovered by micro-lensing).
There is an intriguing aspect in this view of the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn. When the
two planets do not migrate inward at the nominal Type II migration rate, there is necessarily
an inward flow of gas, from the outer disk to the inner disk, through the common gap. Thus,
the outer planet should presumably accrete more of the incoming material, narrowing the mass
difference with the inner planet. This raises the question of why Saturn remained smaller than
Jupiter. The answer may be that the gas disk was rapidly disappearing while Jupiter and Sat-
urn were undergoing the dynamical evolution described above, so that Saturn failed to grow
further.
There are several lines of evidence in favor of a formation of Jupiter and Saturn in a dissi-
pating disk. First, Jupiter’s atmosphere is enriched in elements heavier than helium by a factor
of 3–4 relative to solar composition (Wong et al. 2004), while Saturn is enriched by a factor 11
in Carbon (Fouchet et al. 2009). Guillot and Hueso (2006) have argued that the easiest expla-
nation for this fact is that hydrogen and helium had been already depleted by a factor of 3–4 in
the disk by the time Jupiter captured its atmosphere (and, following this logic, by a factor of 11
by the time Saturn captured its atmosphere). Second, the favored model for the accretion of the
regular satellites of the giant planets also requires that said satellites formed in gas-poor circum-
planetary disks (Canup and Ward 2006). Third, the common explanation for why Uranus and
Neptune failed to accrete massive atmospheres is that the gas disappeared before they had a
chance to do so (Pollack et al. 1996). All these arguments suggest that the four giant plan-
ets formed in a temporal sequence, from Jupiter to Saturn and then to Uranus and Neptune,
while the disk was being dispersed. Finally, recall that the solar composition is at the low end
of the metallicity range for planet-bearing stars. In the core-accretion model of giant planets,
the metallicity of the star is correlated with the speed of accretion of the cores, so that stars that
are too poor in metals fail to form giant planets before the disappearance of the disk (Ida and
Lin 2004). This suggests that the solar system barely made its giant planets, while the disk was
being dispersed.

72 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
If this explanation may be satisfying for our solar system, it is nevertheless interesting to
discuss what would have happened if Jupiter and Saturn had formed earlier, when the disk
was still massive. The issue is not only academic, as it can be pertinent for systems with a
higher initial metal content which, as suggested above, should form planets faster. In a gas-
rich disk, Saturn would have eventually become as massive, or even more massive, than Jupiter.
Thus, the two planets would have resumed an inward migration (Morbidelli and Crida 2007).
The orbital eccentricity of two planets migrating in resonance tends to increase monotonically
(Ferraz-Mello et al. 2003; Kley et al. 2004). This effect is contrasted by the action of the disk,
which tends to damp the planets’ eccentricities (Kley and Dirksen 2006). A crucial role is played
by the disk inside the orbit of the inner planet. This inner disk tends to be partially depleted due
to the presence of the planet(s). The level of depletion depends on several parameters such as
the viscosity of the disk, its scale height, its inner radius, and the mass of the planet(s) rela-
tive to the disk etc. (Crida and Morbidelli 2007). If the inner disk is depleted substantially, the
damping effect on the eccentricity of the inner planet is strongly reduced. In this situation, the
eccentricity of the inner planet keeps growing, until the pair of planets becomes dynamically
unstable and mutual close encounters are triggered (Kley et al. 2005). This may be the case of
many, if not most, of the planetary systems. In fact, mutual scattering seems to be the major
mechanism responsible for the eccentricity distribution observed in the extrasolar planets col-
lection (see >Sect. 2.3 for a more complete discussion). However, if the inner disk is not very
depleted, the eccentricities of the planets grow until a limit value is achieved (Crida et al. 2008;
see > Fig. 2-2). This process can leave the planets at the disappearance of the disk on stable
resonant orbits with moderate eccentricities, and thus, it can explain the pairs of planets in
resonance observed to date.
In conclusion, this section sheds light on the first crucial “bifurcations” in planetary evolu-
tion that can account for at least part of the great diversity observed in planetary systems. In
fact, assuming that giant planets form in sequence at increasing distances from the central star,
most of the observed diversity of planetary systems could stem from the occurrence or avoid-
ance of two events: (i) the capture in resonance of the first, inner planet by the second, initially
smaller one, which stops inward migration (often triggering outward migration), and (ii) the
growth of the outer planet beyond the mass of the inner one, which causes inward migration
of both planets to resume. The solar system structure results from the occurrence of (i) and
avoidance of (ii). Systems like HD 12661, with a close-in massive planet and a distant smaller
planet, result from the avoidance of (i). Resonant giant planets close to their stars, like those in
the GJ876 system, result from the occurrence of both (i) and (ii). Unstable systems, ultimately
leaving behind one giant planet on an eccentric orbit, may also result from the occurrence of
both (i) and (ii), but in cases where there was not enough eccentricity damping because of a
depleted inner disk.
Here, the case with two planets was the only one considered; obviously, the tree of possible
evolutions can only become more complicated if more giant planets are involved, and the final
outcomes can be even more diverse.
2.3 Planet–Planet Scattering as the Dominant Orbital Excitation
Process
One of the greatest surprises that came with the discovery of extrasolar planets is the realization
that most planets have orbital eccentricities much larger than those characterizing the planets of

The evolution of the eccentricities of planets b and c around GJ876 during their putative inward
resonant migration. The eccentricity of the interior planet is labeled e1, that of the exterior planet
e2. The evolutions labeled “no inn.” assume that no disk is present inside the orbit of the interior
planet; in this case, the eccentricities seem to grow indeﬁnitely. The evolutions labeled “ref.” and
“p = 0.8”account for an inner disk and diﬀer just for the value of a technical simulation parameter.
In these cases the eccentricities attain equilibrium values. In the “ref” case, the ﬁnal eccentricities
reproduce the eccentricities inferred from observations (horizontal lines) (from Crida et al. (2008))
our solar system. Eccentricities of about 0.4 are quite common in the extrasolar planets collec-
tion; some planets have eccentricities largerthan 0.6, values that in oursolarsystem are common
only for comets!
Whatever the preferred model of giant planet formation (core-accretion or gravitational
instability; see >Sect. 2.1), it is expected that planets have originally small orbital eccentrici-
ties, because they form from a circumstellar disk whose streamlines are basically circular. There
has been a lively debate on whether subsequent planet-disk interactions can raise the planets’
eccentricities up to the observed values. Papaloizou et al. (2001) concluded, with numerical
experiments and theoretical considerations, that eccentricity growth is not possible for plan-
etary masses below 10–20 Jupiter masses. Instead, Goldreich and Sari (2003) argued with
theoretical considerations that, under some conditions, depending mostly on disk’s thickness,
giant planets of more moderate masses could have their orbital eccentricity excited, although
they could not estimate the magnitude of this excitation. More recent hydrodynamical simu-
lations (D’Angelo et al. 2006; Kley and Dirksen 2006) showed that planets with masses larger

74 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
than ∼2–3 Jupiter masses, under some conditions, can have eccentricities excited by the disk,
but only to moderate values (∼0.1–0.2), definitely lower than those characterizing many, if not
most, of the extrasolar planets. In most cases, the planet-disks interactions rather seem to lead to
eccentricity damping. Thus, a more generic orbital excitation mechanism seems to be required
to explain the observations.
Soon after the discovery of the first eccentric planets, it was pointed out that mutual
encounters between planets can easily provide strong orbital excitation (Rasio and Ford 1996;
Weidenschilling and Marzari 1996; Lin and Ida 1997; Levison et al. 1998; Ford et al. 2001;
Marzari and Weidenschilling 2002; Adams and Laughlin 2003). More recent studies (Juri´c and
Tremaine 2008; Chatterjee et al. 2008; Ford and Rasio 2008; Raymond et al. 2009a; Beauge and
Nesvorny 2011) show that random systems of giant planets initially on unstable, quasi-circular
orbits evolve through close encounters until a dynamical relaxation state is achieved with the
ejection or collision of some planets. In these models, the final eccentricity distribution of the
surviving planets is remarkably similar to that of known extrasolar planets (see > Fig. 2-3).
Moreover, Juri´c and Tremaine (2008) and Raymond et al. (2009a) showed that the final orbital
spacing of the surviving planets is also in good agreement with the observations of extrasolar
systems of two or more nonresonant planets. These systems typically look “packed,” in the sense
that the orbital separation (apocenter to pericenter) between neighboring planets is not much
larger than what is required by the Hill-stability criterion (Barnes and Greenberg 2006). Finally,

ing from the simulations agree very well, with the exception of an excess of observed planets with

reached their current orbits via planet–planet scattering and tidal circularization (Beauge and
Nesvorny 2011).
All these quantitative results give strong support to the idea that planet–planet scattering is
the main mechanism sculpting the orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. In addition, Veras
et al. (2009) pointed out that planet–planet scattering can propel a planet in the region beyond
100 AU, which can explain some of the extrasolar planets imaged at large distances from their
parent stars.2
It is important to remember that, assuming giant planets formed beyond an hypothetical
snow line at 3–5 AU, the planet–planet scattering mechanism alone cannot explain the observed
semimajoraxis distribution ofextrasolarplanets (see, forinstance, Marzari and Weidenschilling
2002). In fact, through scattering events, planets can have difficulty reaching orbits with semi-
major axis smaller than half of the initial value of the inner planet, with the exception of those
objects scattered onto orbits with very large eccentricities and small periastron distances, which
may then become circularized by tidal dissipation. Thus, migration is still required to explain
the presence of a large number of planets on orbits with small semimajor axes. Adams and
Laughlin (2003) and Moorhead and Adams (2005) modeled the interplay between migration
and scattering. They used N-body simulations, with fictitious forces to mimic the effect of the
disk on the planets, for what concerns both semimajor axis decay and eccentricity damping.
After tuning a few parameters (the lifetime of the disk, the timescale of the eccentricity damp-
ing, etc.) and accounting for observational biases, Moorhead and Adams obtained a very good
reproduction of the two-dimensional (a, e) distribution of the exoplanets detected by the radial
velocity technique (>Fig. 2-4). Although very appealing, this result may be questioned because
the numerical recipes used to mimic migration and damping have been based on simple ana-
lytic estimates. Reality may be more complicated. For instance, as seen above, a system of two
planets in resonance may migrate at a very different speed than a single planet in Type II migra-
tion (Morbidelli and Crida 2007); the disk may not always damp the eccentricity of a planet but
could also sustain it, depending on the planet mass and initial eccentricity (Kley and Dirksen
2006); migration direction could be reversed for eccentric planets (D’Angelo et al. 2006); and,
finally, mass accretion onto the planets is neglected in the Moorhead and Adams model.
For all these reasons, there are two key questions requiring further study in a definitive way:
(1) Why do giant planets become unstable in the first place? (2) When do they become unstable,
relative to the gas-disk lifetime?
Concerning the first question, there are in principle two answers: either planetary systems
become unstable because the planets grow in mass or because the planets are brought too close
to each other by migration processes. The first case may be excluded as a dominant mechanism
to explain the large eccentricities of extrasolar giant planets for the following reason. Imagine a
system of cores close to each other (maybe brought by Type I migration into mutual resonances
of type n/(n + ), with quite large n). Given that the time required to trigger the runaway
accretion of a massive atmosphere is much longer than the accretion of the atmosphere itself
(Pollack et al. 1996), it is unlikely that all the cores would accrete massive atmospheres and
become giant planets simultaneously. More realistically, one core would start the accretion ofthe
2In summary, three mechanisms have been proposed to move planets from the snow line region to large dis-
tances from the central star: (i) outward Type II migration of planets originally formed in the outer part of a
disk in rapid viscous spreading (Veras and Armitage 2004), (ii) outward migration of a pair of resonant planets
with a Jupiter-Saturn mass hierarchy (Crida et al. 2009), and (iii) scattering of a planet to a wide elliptic orbit
(Veras et al. 2009). These mechanisms are potential alternatives to the possibility that distant planets formed
in situ, by the gravitational instability mechanism (Boley 2009)

atmosphere first, and it would acquire a mass much larger than those of the other planets at that
time. The system would become unstable, because it is too closely packed to withstand the newly
born giant planet. However, the scattering phase would bring the cores onto orbits with large
eccentricities, but it would leave the newly born giant planet onto a quasi-circular orbit: This
does not correspond to the measured orbital distribution of the extrasolar planets. Moreover,
the orbital eccentricities of the cores would be damped very fast by the disk (Cresswell et al.
2007; Bitsch and Kley 2010), and, by the time these cores grow, in turn, to become giant planets,
they would be again on quasi-circular orbits. A system of multiple giant planets probably forms
through several repetitions of the events described above but, at each step of the process, the
already formed giant planets should be those on the least eccentric orbits.3
However, note that the process described above is probably not the one that governs the
final orbital distribution of giant planet systems. A more generic mechanism to achieve the

semimajor axis, while MS is the mass of the star. Suppose now that planets tend to acquire orbits whose mutual
separation is not much larger than this Hill-stability limit. If a planetary system is made of two planetary cores,
when one of two objects becomes a giant planet, the system is likely to be destabilized because RH increases
by a factor 3–4 as the mass of one planet grows by a factor 30–60. Instead, a stable system made of one giant
planet and one core is not likely to be strongly destabilized when the core grows to the status of a giant planet,
because RH increases only by a factor ∼(/) = .. Similarly, in a system made of one giant planet and two

ultimate dynamical instability (the one responsible for the final orbits) is that two or more giant
planets, once fullyformed, are brought in resonance with each otherbyType II migration, which
causes a subsequent increase of their orbital eccentricities (Ferraz-Mello et al. 2003; Kley et al.
2004, 2005; Crida et al. 2008).
This leads to the second question, on the timing of the instability. In the Adams and Laugh-
lin (2003) and Moorhead and Adams (2005) models, the planets become unstable while they
are still migrating in the gas disk. However, limited experience with hydrodynamical simula-
tions of giant planets scattering each other in gas disks shows that the evolution can be quite
different from the one modeled in those works. Scattered planets tend to acquire orbits that are
more separated in semimajor axis and more eccentric, but then the eccentricities are damped
by the disk and the planets migrate back into a new, more stable resonant configuration, with
moderate eccentricities (see, for instance, >Fig. 2-5 or Moekel et al. 2008). It is possible that
systems with more planets develop more violent instabilities that extend also longer in time.
However, new simulations with three planets, presented in Marzari et al. (2010) and Moeckel

curves shows the evolution of the periastron (q) and apoastron (Q) distances. Thus, when the two

The light curves at the bottom are for the inner planet, with a three Jupiter mass; the thick curves at

tric and separate from each other at the time of the instability, after about 500–700 orbits of the
inner planet. Subsequently, the eccentricities of the planets are damped, and the inward migra-
tion of the outer planet brings it in the 1/2 resonance with the inner one (t = 1,000). Once in
resonance, the eccentricity increases again and starts to have long-period oscillations. A relatively
stable conﬁguration is achieved (from Morbidelli and Crida (2007))

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
and Armitage (2012), again show that the planets surviving at the end of the instability phase
have low-eccentricity orbits. Until we know more from hydrodynamical simulations about the
dynamics of eccentric planets, it is premature to conclude whether instabilities produced dur-
ing the gas-disk phase would lead to the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. The
other possibility is that during the gas-disk phase, planets acquire stable resonant and eccentric
orbital configurations, which become unstable when the gas is removed. This is the approach
of Lin and Ida (1997), Levison et al. (1998), Juri´c and Tremaine (2008), and Chatterjee et al.
(2008), to quote just a few works.
The facts that most extrasolar planets have quite large eccentricities and that there are only
a few pairs of stable resonant planets suggest that orbital instability in planetary systems is more
the rule than the exception. It would be quite surprising if most planet configurations achieved
through migration were stable in presence of gas and unstable in absence of gas. In fact, the
gas has some stabilizing effect due to the eccentricity damping that it exerts, but it also drives
migration, which in turn excites the eccentricity. The two effects cancel out when a limit eccen-
tricity is attained (>Fig. 2-2). At this point, the gas should not play any longer any crucial role
in maintaining stability. One possibility is that most resonant configurations achieved through
migration are unstable in both cases (with gas and without gas), but the instability manifests
itself on timescales of several millions of years, i.e., well after that the gas has been removed. To
have a better appreciation of reality, one needs a more systematic hydrodynamical simulations
of the dynamics of sets of giant planets embedded in gas disks, followed by the investigation of
their subsequent long-term evolutions after the gas removal. A work of this kind has been done
for the planets of our solar system (Morbidelli et al. 2007; see >Sect. 2.4), but it is obviously
more demanding in general, given the volume of parameter space that needs to be explored.
Naively, planets that develop instabilities and mutual encounters after having migrated to
the vicinity of the central star should acquire smaller eccentricities than those that do so further
away from the star. This is because the eccentricity acquired in an encounter is proportional to
the ratio between the velocity kick received during said encounter and the orbital velocity. The
former depends on the escape velocities from the surface of the planets and is independent of
the orbital radius, while the latter is larger for the close-in planets. Instead, Juri´c and Tremaine
(2008) showed numerically that the eccentricity distribution achieved at dynamical relaxation
(i.e., after many encounters) is essentially independent of the semimajor axes of the planets.
Given that no clear correlation is found between distance and eccentricity in the extrasolar
planets collection (apart from the tidal circularization zone), this result gives a quite strong
support to the idea that planets first migrate toward the central star and then, after gas removal,
become unstable.
2.4 A Plausible Evolution of the Four Giant Planets of the Solar
System
Returning to the solar system, what is a plausible scenario for the evolution of the four major
planets during the gas-disk phase? As seen above ( >Sect. 2.2), hydrodynamical simulations
strongly suggest that Jupiter and Saturn rapidly reached a 2/3 resonant orbital configuration
and that this prevented them from migrating further toward the Sun. Once in resonance, these
giant planets either remained on nonmigrating orbits or migrated outward.
What about Uranus and Neptune? According to the latest models on the migration of plan-
etary cores in radiative disks, Uranus and Neptune, or their precursors, should have evolved

on nonmigrating orbits in the intermediate part of the disk (Lyra et al. 2010). If Uranus
and Neptune did not migrate while Jupiter and Saturn achieved nonmigrating orbits after a
period of inward migration, eventually the giant planets system should have been characterized
by a large separation between the Jupiter/Saturn pair and the Uranus/Neptune pair (see left
panel of >Fig. 2-6). How to reconcile this peculiar orbital structure with the current structure
of the solar system is unknown. Instead, if Jupiter and Saturn migrated outward, Uranus and
Neptune would have been caught in mean-motion resonances with the two major planets (see
right panel of >Fig. 2-6). The same would have occurred also in the case where Jupiter and
Saturn remained on nonmigrating orbits but Uranus and Neptune started to migrate inward
due to a change of the thermal properties of the disk over time (Lyra et al. 2010). What matters,
in fact, is the convergent migration between the Jupiter/Saturn pair and the Uranus/Neptune
pair, not which pair of planets is moving.
A search for possible resonant configurations that could havebeen achieved by the two pairs
ofplanets in convergent migration has been done in Morbidelli et al. (2007), using hydrodynam-
ical simulations, and in Batygin and Brown (2010), using N-body simulations with fictitious
forces that mimic the effect of the disk. The search is probably not complete, in the sense that
other relative resonant configurations might have been achieved, depending on disk proper-
ties, migration speed, and initial Uranus/Neptune configuration. Three results, however, seem
robust. First, in case of convergent migration, each planet ends up in resonance with its neigh-
bor. Thus, the planets should have been in a 4-bodyresonance, the most complexmulti-resonant
configuration in the solar system.4 Second, because distant resonances are weak and have a low
probability to capture a migrating body, the four planets most likely should have achieved a very
compact orbital configuration. Third, the eccentricities of the planets should have remained
small (less than 0.005 for Jupiter, 0.02 for Saturn, 0.06 for Uranus, and 0.015 for Neptune in
Morbidelli et al. simulations). Thus, Jupiter and Saturn should have been on orbits significantly
more circular than now.
Morbidelli et al. also investigated the long-term stability of resonant orbital configura-
tions that they found. This was done by continuing each hydrodynamical simulation for 1,500
Jupiter’s orbits, while removing uniformly the gas, exponentially in time, down to a factor of
1/1,000. This procedure was just instrumental for changing adiabatically the potential felt by
the planets and was not intended to mimic the real process of evaporation of the disk. The final
orbits of the planets were then passed to a symplectic N-body code, and integrated for 1 Gy,
without additional perturbations (forinstance, from a planetesimal disk). Morbidelli et al. found
that only one configuration was stable for 1 Gy. This result was actually affected by an error of
the integrator, which was discovered only later. In reality, 4 of the 6 configurations found in
Morbidelli et al. are stable for 1 Gy. The only unstable configurations are the two most com-
pact ones, with Uranus in the 3/4 resonance with Saturn and Neptune in either the 4/5 or
5/6 resonances with Uranus. These configurations lead to very violent instabilities, with close
encounters of all the planets with each other, including close encounters of Jupiter with Sat-
urn. In these cases, orbital relaxation is achieved when all planets except Jupiter are ejected
on hyperbolic or distant eccentric orbits. Obviously, this is not what happened in our solar
system. But, in these simulations, the final orbit of Jupiter, with an eccentricity of ∼., is sim-
ilar to those of the extrasolar planets discovered to date at a distance of 4–5 AU from their
parent stars. This suggests that these extrasolar planets might be the survivors of systems that
4Currently, the record for the most complex resonance chain in the solar system is detained by Jupiter’s satellites
Io, Europa, and Ganymede, which are locked in a 3-body resonance, also known as the Laplace resonance.

Sketch of the possible migration and accretion histories of the giant planets of the solar system, while they were embedded in the disk of gas. Both scenarios
assume that (i) Saturn was eventually caught Jupiter in their mutual 2/3 resonance (see >Sect. 2.2 for conditions) and (ii) planets with masses smaller than
∼50 Earth masses do not migrate in radiative disks. In the left panel, Jupiter and Saturn do not migrate after resonance capture. This leaves a large gap
between the Jupiter/Saturn pair and the Uranus/Neptune pair that cannot be reconciled (to our current knowledge) with the current orbital structure of
the planets. In the right panel, Jupiter and Saturn migrate outward. This leads to the capture of Uranus and Neptune in resonance with Saturn and with
themselves. This resonant conﬁguration is consistent with the current orbits of the planet via a phase of dynamical instability after the dispersal of the disk

avoided Type II migration, possibly through a mechanism like the Jupiter-Saturn one, but which
achieved orbital resonant configurations so compact to undergo a violent instability involv-
ing encounters between gas-giant planets. Our solar system was luckier and picked up a less
compact multi-resonant configuration, so that encounters between Jupiter and Saturn could be
avoided.
The next section shows that the least compact resonant configurations, which are stable
when only the four planets (Jupiter to Neptune) are considered, can become unstable when the
interactions of the planets with a remnant planetesimal disk are taken into account. The solar
system may have passed through such an instability phase, reconciling the current orbits with
those that the planets should have had when they emerged from the gas-disk phase (see also
Thommes et al. 1999).

The Planetesimal-Disk Era
3.1 Brief Tutorial of Planetesimal-Driven Migration
A planet embedded in a planetesimal disk has repeated close encounters with the objects
that come close to its orbit. Each of these encounters modifies the trajectory of the incom-
ing planetesimal, and, consequently, the planet has to suffer a small recoil. In this way, if
the planetesimal disk is sufficiently massive, significant angular momentum exchange may
occur between the planet and the planetesimals, enough to cause a rapid, long-range migra-
tion of the planet (Ida et al. 2000). A review of planetesimal-driven migration has been
presented in Levison et al. (2007). The sections below review the basic concepts that are rel-
evant for understanding the evolution of our solar system and, possibly, of planetary systems in
general.
For a system of giant planets, planetesimal-driven migration is relevant only after the disap-
pearance of the gas. The reason is that the gas contains typically ∼100 times more mass than the
planetesimals, and therefore it exerts the dominant gravitational forces on the planets. Conse-
quently, planetesimal-driven migration was not mentioned in the previous part of this chapter.
It should be remembered, though, that for small planets, gas-driven migration is proportional
to the planet’s mass (Ward 1997), whereas planetesimal-driven migration is, at first order, inde-
pendent of the planet’s mass (Ida et al. 2000; Kirsh et al. 2009); thus, for small planets, such as
planetary embryos of an Earth-mass or smaller, planetesimal-driven migration may rival, under
some conditions, Type I migration (Levison et al. 2010; Capobianco et al. 2011).
One may naively think that planetesimal scattering is a purely random process, which con-
sequently cannot force a planet to migrate in a specific direction. This is not true. To zeroth
order, during an encounter, the planetesimal is in a Keplerian orbit about the planet. Since the
energy of this orbit must be conserved, all the encounter can do is to rotate the relative velocity
vector. Thus, the consequences of such an encounter can be effectively computed in most of the
cases using an impulse approximation (Öpik 1976; Ida et al. 2000). With this approach, it is easy
to compute that on average (that is averaged on all impact parameters and relative orientations),
the planetesimals that cause a planet to move outward are those whose z-component of the spe-
cific angular momentum, H =
√
a(−e) cos i, is larger than that of the planet (Hp). In fact,
during the encounter, these planetesimals have an azimuthal angular velocity faster than that
of the planet: Thus, they tend to be slowed down, propelling in turn the planet along its orbit.

82 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
The opposite is true for the planetesimals with H < Hp (Valsecchi and Manara 1997). In these
formulæ a, e and i are the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the planetesimal.
The direction of migration for a single planet in principle depends on the angular momen-
tum distribution of objects on planet-encountering orbits. Nevertheless, the direction of migra-
tion does not simply depend on the sign of ¯H −Hp, where ¯H denotes the mass-weighted value
of H of the planet-crossing particles: There is a bias in scattering timescales on either side of
the planet’s orbit which leads to a very strong tendency for the planet to migrate inward (Kirsh
et al. 2009). Consequently, outward migration is found only in systems where ¯H−Hp is strongly
positive, such as for planetesimal disks with surface density distribution proportional to rk with
k > (the value of k for the real disks is expected to be between −and −, definitely giving
inward migration).
In order to understand the basic modes of migration, imagine defining a function F of the
H-distribution of the planet-crossing particles, such that the planet’s migration rate dap/dt is
proportional to F (which implies that migration is inward if F is negative, while it is outward
otherwise). For a given orbital distribution of the planetesimalsin the planet-encountering zone
(i.e., for a fixed value of F), the rate of migration in the local units of length and time must
be proportional to the total mass M of the planet-encountering planetesimals (Ida et al. 2000;
Gomes et al. 2004; Levison et al. 2007). Thus, one can write
dap/ap
dt/T
∼MF ,
where T is the planet’s orbital period. When a planet migrates, several concomitant processes
occur:
(a) The planetesimals that are scattered in the direction opposite to that of planet migration
(e.g., onto an orbit with a larger semimajor axis, for an inward migrating planet) can be
“left behind,” in the sense that they can find themselves on orbits which do not cross the
planet’s orbit any more (because the orbit of the planet has drifted away; see >Fig. 2-7).
Conversely, other planetesimals, originally situated on stable orbits in the disk through
which the planet is moving, start to be scattered. Thus, planetesimals both enter and leave
the planet-encountering region as a result of the radial drift of the planet’s orbit through
the disk. This orbital drift tends to leave F unchanged but changes M; the latter increases
or decreases depending on the gradient of the disk’s surface density.
(b) The planet encounters tend to rearrange the angular momentum distribution of the plan-
etesimals to an equilibrium configuration that would induce no migration; this decreases
∣F∣toward zero, while preserving M.
(c) Some planetesimals may be eliminated from the system through collisions with the planet
or ejections onto hyperbolic orbit, which decreases M.
Depending on whether, as a net result of all these processes, ∣MF∣increases or decreases,
radial migration accelerates exponentially or decays to zero. The former case is called forced or
self-sustained migration; the latter is called damped migration. Whereas processes (b) and (c)
inexorably tend to damp the planet’s migration (because they reduce either ∣F∣or M), process
(a)can sustain the migration ifit leads toan increase of M. Thus, self-sustained migration occurs
if two conditions are met: First, process (a) has to give a positive feedback on migration, which
translates into a condition on the gradient of the surface density of the disk; second, the mass
M has to be large enough so that the timescale of process (a), which is proportional to /M, is
faster than those of (b) and (c), which are independent of M.

ity versus semimajor axis distribution of the planetesimals (dots) at the time marked in the top left
corner. The dashed curves delimit the planet-crossing region. The planet is situated at the point of
intersection of these curves. Notice how planetesimals are “left behind”on eccentric orbits as the
planet migrates inward (adapted from Kirsh et al. (2009))
The dynamical evolution is qualitatively different if there are two planets. In this case, plan-
etesimals can be scattered by one planet onto an orbit that has close encounters with the other
planet. This transfer of particles from the “control” of one planet to the other tends to increase
the orbital separation between the planets. However, the planets can effectively move away
from each other only if they are not locked in a mutual mean-motion resonance (the orbital
response of resonant planets is different and will be discussed in > Sect. 3.2). Assuming no
resonance locking, under some conditions, this orbital divergence can lead the outer planet to
migrate outward, even in planetesimal disks in which a single planet would normally migrate
inward. In particular, this is the case for a Neptune-mass planet on an orbit exterior to a Jupiter-
mass planet. In fact, the planetesimals that the Neptune-mass planet scatters inward onto orbits
crossing that of the Jupiter-mass planet, are rapidly ejected onto hyperbolic orbits by the latter;

84 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
conversely, the planetesimals that the Neptune-mass planet scatters outward, remain on orbits
crossing that same planet and have repeated encounters with it: Sooner or later, most of them
will be eventually scattered inward and then removed by an encounter with the Jupiter-mass
planet. In conclusions, the net work of the Neptune-mass planet is to transfer planetesimals
inward to the control of the Jupiter-mass planet, and consequently the Neptune-mass planet
has to move outward.
The case of the giant planets of our solar system, with Jupiter in the innermost orbit,
two Neptune-Uranus-mass planets on the outermost orbits, and one intermediate-mass planet
(Saturn) in between, is somewhat analog to the simple Jupiter-Neptune system described above
(if, again, the planets are not in resonance and are free to migrate relative to each other).
With N-body simulations, Fernandez and Ip (1984) showed for the first time that Jupiter
migrates inward, while Saturn and, particularly, Uranus and Neptune move outward. Malhotra
(1993, 1995) elaborated on this kind of evolution to explain the observed orbital properties of
the Kuiper belt (a population of planetesimals, including Pluto, with semimajor axes beyond
that of Neptune). The original version of the “Nice model”5 (Tsiganis et al. 2005; Gomes et al.
2005), that aimed to build a coherent scenario of the late orbital evolution of the outer solar
system, was also based on this process of divergent migration of the giant planets. Given our
current understanding that the giant planets, at the end of the gas-disk era, had to be in reso-
nance with each other (see previous section), these models are not strictly valid any more and
consequently will not be discussed further. A new version of the “Nice model,” which starts from
a multi-resonant orbital configuration of the giant planets, is instead illustrated in > Sects. 3.2
and >3.3.
There are nevertheless some important results of general relevance that these studies
brought to light. The concepts of self-sustained migration and damped migration apply to the
multi-planet case as well. In the case of self-sustained migration, Neptune tends to migrate to
the outer edge of the planetesimal disk or at least up to a large distance (∼100 AU) from the
Sun (Gomes et al. 2004). In the case of damped migration, the planets attain a final orbital
configuration after having removed all planetesimals in between them and leaving a massive
disk of objects a few AUs beyond the final orbit of Neptune (Gomes et al. 2004). Given that the
Kuiper belt contains very little mass (probably less than 0.01 M⊕; Fuentes and Holman 2008)
and excluding, from considerations based on its orbital and size distributions, that said little
mass is the result of collisional grinding (Morbidelli et al. 2008b; see, however, Kenyon et al.
2008 for an opposite view), the original planetesimal disk in our solar system likely had an
effective outer edge at ∼30 AU, close to the current location of Neptune (Gomes et al. 2004;
Morbidelli et al. 2008b).
Another general result is that the eccentricities of the planets are damped during
planetesimal-driven migration. This is related toa process called dynamical friction, well known
in models of planet formation. In essence, dynamical friction is the mechanism by which gravi-
tating objects of different masses exchange energy so as to evolve toward an equipartition of
energy of relative motion (Saslaw 1985): As a general rule, for a system of planets embed-
ded in a massive population of small bodies, the eccentricities and inclinations of the former
are damped, while those of the latter are excited (Stewart and Wetherill 1988). Thus, during
planetesimal-driven migration, the only possibility for the enhancement of the planets’ eccen-
tricities is that the planets pass through mutual resonances as their orbits diverge from each
other (Chiang 2003; Tsiganis et al. 2005).

3.2 Multi-resonant Planet Conﬁgurations and Planetesimal
Scattering: The Solar System Case
When two planets are in a mutual mean-motion resonance, their orbits cannot move freely
relative to each other: The resonance holds constant the ratio between the orbital periods, i.e.,
between the orbital semimajor axes. Thus, both planets have to migrate at the same relative
rate. In this case, the differential forces that act on the planets from the planetesimals disk mod-
ify instead the orbital eccentricities of the planets. More precisely, if the interaction with the
planetesimals is such that, in absence of the mean-motion resonance, the planets would suf-
fer divergent migration (i.e., the ratio between the semimajor axes of the outer and the inner
planets would increase), the eccentricities of the planets decrease (Henrard 1993). When the
eccentricities are low enough, the planets can eventually exit their resonance. At this point, if
the planets are still stable, normal divergent migration, as discussed in the previous section,
can start.
Consider now the case of the solar system. Assume, for instance, that the planets were in
the least compact of the multi-resonant configurations found in Morbidelli et al. (2007): Saturn
is in the 2/3 resonance with Jupiter, Uranus is in the 2/3 resonance with Saturn, and Nep-
tune is in the 3/4 resonance with Uranus. Assume that the system, at the disappearance of the
gas, is still embedded in a planetesimal disk, of about 65 M⊕, with an outer edge at ∼30 AU.
>Figure 2-8 shows what happens: Due to the gravitational interaction between the planets and
the planetesimals, the semimajor axes of the planetary orbits change. Thus, after a short time,
the planets are extracted from their multiple resonance. Resonances have a strong stabilizing
effect for close orbits (a clear example is that of Pluto which, despite crossing the orbit of Nep-
tune, is stable because it is in the 2/3 mean-motion resonance with it). Once the planets are
extracted from their mutual resonances, this stabilizing effect ends. The planets rapidly become
unstable, because they are too close to each other. In the simulation illustrated in >Fig. 2-8, the
onset of the instability occurs at t ∼My. Uranus and Neptune start to have close encounters
with each other and with Saturn. As a result, the orbits of all the planets become more eccen-
tric; Uranus and Neptune are propelled outward by encounters with Saturn, onto very eccentric
orbits. Their orbital eccentricities are then strongly damped by dynamical friction, which stabi-
lizes the motion of the planets and prevents further mutual close encounters; the eccentricities
of Jupiter and Saturn are also damped but to a lesser extent. At the same time, planetesimal-
driven migration, which can operate once the planets are extracted from resonance, increases
further the orbital separations between each pair of planets. At the end of the simulation, the
planets have acquired orbits very similar to their current ones: The semimajor axes are within
10% of the observed values, and the eccentricities and inclinations are also comparable. Most
of the planetesimal disk has been dispersed by then, so that little orbital evolution is expected
to occur after 100 My.
This simulation shows that the multi-resonant configuration, which the giant planets should
have been driven into during the gas-disk phase, is not incompatible with the current orbital
configuration: The interaction with the planetesimals disk and the temporary phase of global
instability, which the planets experience afterextraction from theiroriginal resonances, can very
well lead the system to its current dynamical state (Thommes et al. 1999). More examples of this
kind of successful evolution, starting also from different multi-resonant orbital configurations,
can be found in Batygin and Brown (2010).

tric. In this simulation, Uranus and Neptune are scattered outward by encounters with Saturn and

3.3 The Late Heavy Bombardment as a Smoking Gun for a Late
Instability of the Giant Planets
In >Fig. 2-8, the dynamical instability occurs early, after only 2 My from the beginning of the
simulation. However, there is evidence that in our solar system, the onset of the dynamical
instability happened much later, approximately 600 My after the disappearance of the disk of
gas: This piece of evidence comes from the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB).
The LHB is a putative cataclysmic period around ∼3.9 Gy ago, marked by a collision rate
on the Moon that was higher than the one during the immediately preceding period and much
higher than the one characterizing the current time. The existence of the LHB was originally
proposed by Tera et al. (1974), given the clustering at ∼3.9 Gy ago of radiometric impact ages of
the lunar samples collected by the Apollo missions (Papanastassiou and Wasserburg 1971a, b;
Wasserburg and Papanastassiou 1971; Turner et al. 1973). More recently, the radiometric evi-
dence in favor of the LHB has been reinforced by new laboratory analysis (Cohen et al. 2000) on

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems 2
87
lunar meteorites, which should be representative of the whole lunar surface, unlike the Apollo
samples.
However, the existence of the LHB has remained controversial since the time when it was
first proposed. Some authors (see for instance Neukum and Wilhelms 1982; Neukum and
Ivanov 1994; Baldwin 2006; Hartmann et al. 2007) interpret the high bombardment rate ∼3.9Gy
ago as the tail of a slowly declining, even-more-intense bombardment occurring since the time
of formation of the terrestrial planets. In this view, the paucity of impact ages older that about
4 Gy ago is argued to be the result of a selection effect (see, e.g., Hartmann et al. 2000; Chap-
man et al. 2007). In essence, the subsequent intense impactor flux would have ground down the
oldest impact melts, reducing them to particle sizes smaller than 60 µm. Thus, they would not
appear in datable samples.
The analysis of the lunar crater record also gives an ambiguous view of the time evolution of
the Lunar bombardment. Neukum and Wilhelms (1982) (see also Neukum 1983; Neukum and
Ivanov 1994) studied the crater density over terrains of “known” radiometric age, concluding in
favor of a smooth decay of the impactor flux, in opposition to the LHB hypothesis. The problem,
however, is that only the youngest units, starting with the Imbrium basin ∼3.8–3.9 Gy ago, have
well-established radiometric ages, whereas the ages of older basins, like Nectaris, are subjects
of debate (e.g., Norman et al. 2010). Neukum and collaborators assumed that age of Nectaris
basin is ∼4.1 Gy, because this age appears in the samples collected by the Apollo 16 mission in
the Descartes region, near Nectaris (Maurer et al. 1978). With this assumption, the density of
craters as a function of age of the terrains seems to follow a exponential decline with a decay
time of 140 My, which is then extrapolated backward in time, until the Moon formation event
(∼4.5 Gy ago; see Kleine et al. 2009).
Instead, Stöffler and Ryder (2001) and Ryder (2002) argued that the age of Nectaris is 3.9 Gy,
because this age appears more prominently than the 4.1 Gy age among the Descartes region
samples of Apollo 16. If one assumes this age, then the same crater counts on Nectaris imply a
bombardment rate that has a much steeper decline over the 3.9–3.5 Gy period than in Neukum
and Ivanov (1994). This steeper decline cannot be extrapolated in time back to the lunar forma-
tion event, becauseit would lead to unphysical implications. For instance, the Moon would have
accreted more than a Moon mass since its formation (Ryder 2002). Consequently, this implies
that the bombardment rate could not have declined smoothly; instead, the bombardment rate
should have been smaller before 3.9 Gy ago than in the 3.9–3.5 Gy period, in agreement with
the LHB hypothesis. However, as said above, the age of Nectaris is uncertain (Norman et al.
2010). Thus, no definitive conclusion can be derived in favor of the cataclysm or the smooth
exponential decline hypothesis.
The following four lines of evidence favor an LHB:
(i) The old upper crustal lithologies of the Moon do not show the enrichment in highly
siderophile elements that should be expected if the lunar bombardment had declined
exponentially as envisioned in Neukum and Ivanov (1994) (Ryder 2002; Morbidelli et al.
2012).
(ii) Given the fast dynamical and collisional decay of the population of planetesimals that
remain in the vicinityofthe Earth’s orbit at the end ofthe accretion process ofthe terrestrial
planets, the formation of two huge impact structures such as the Imbrium and Orientale
basins (and probably many more) on the Moon 600 My later implies an implausible initial
total mass of solids in the inner solar system (Bottke et al. 2007).

88 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
(iii) The bombardment rate 3.8–3.9Gy ago (as deduced from the lunar crater record) was prob-
ably not intense enough to vaporize the oceans on Earth (Abramov and Mojzsis 2009).
However, if this bombardment rate had been the tail of a more intense bombardment,
smoothly decaying over time since lunar formation, the ocean evaporation threshold
should have been overcome just a few hundreds of millions of years earlier (∼4.2 Gy ago).
This contrasts with the oxygen isotopic signature of the oldest known zircons (age: 4.4 Gy),
which indicates formation temperatures compatible with the existence of liquid water
(Valley et al. 2002).
(iv) The crater size-frequency distributions on the lunar highlands and on the Nectaris basin
are different; this difference is well explained by a drastic change in the velocity of the
impactors (Marchi et al. 2012). This finding suggests that the dynamics in the inner solar
system changed substantially at the time of the formation of the Nectaris basin, as expected
in the LHB hypothesis.
The existence of an LHB implies that a massive population of planetesimals must have been
stored for∼600 Myin a stable reservoir, which then was suddenlydestabilized. The onlyintuitive
way to do this is that there was a sudden change in the orbital structure of the planets at that
time (Levison et al. 2001). In fact, the planets, in particular the giant ones, control the dynamical
evolution of the small bodies and determine which reservoir is stable and which unstable. The
planetary evolution illustrated in >Fig. 2-8 would do a great job in causing an impact spike,
by destabilizing the full outer planetesimal disk when Uranus and Neptune are propelled to
their current orbital semimajor axes. The asteroid belt would also be partially destabilized when
Jupiter and Saturn acquire their current eccentricities and move toward their current orbital
separation (Gomes et al. 2005; Minton and Malhotra 2009). The same is true for the putative
extension of the asteroid belt toward Mars, named the “E-belt,” which probably would have
dominated the impact rate on the Moon (Bottke et al. 2010, 2011). However, in the simulation
of >Fig. 2-8, the spike would occur too early to coincide with the LHB spike. One needs to find
a plausible explanation for which the extraction of the giant planets from their original multiple
resonance occurred not after only 2 My (as in >Fig. 2-8) but approximately 600 My later.
The reason that the instability occurs early in the simulation of >Fig. 2-8 and in the sim-
ulations of Batygin and Brown (2010) is that the planets were assumed to be embedded in a
planetesimal disk, so that the interaction with said disk was very strong. As pointed out in
Gomes et al. (2005), however, this is an unlikely configuration. In fact, the planetesimals that
are originally in between the orbits of the giant planets are violently unstable, with a dynamical
lifetime well shorter than 1 My. Thus, they should have been removed (by colliding with the
planets, being ejected onto distant orbits, etc.) well before the disappearance of the gas, which
typically lasts 3–5 My in a protoplanetary disk (Haisch et al. 2001). Then, as said at the begin-
ning of >Sect. 3, the early removal of these planetesimals should not have changed the orbital
configuration of the planets, because the dominant forces exerted by the disk of gas forced the
planets to stay in their multiple resonance. Therefore, it is more likely that, at the disappearance
of the gas, when N-body simulations like that of >Fig. 2-8 become relevant, the planetesimals
were only on those orbits whose dynamical lifetime is of the order of the gas-disk lifetime or
longer. This constrains the planetesimals to be in a trans-Neptunian disk, with an inner edge sit-
uated at least 1–2 AUs beyond the original semimajor axis of Neptune (for simplicity, the planet
that is the most distant from the Sun is designated “Neptune”; notice that in some simulations
– that of >Fig. 2-8 for instance – the two last planets in order of distance from the Sun switch
orbits; in these cases, Uranus would have been originally the most distant planet from the Sun).

The same as >Fig. 2-8, but for a planetesimal disk with an inner edge suitably placed beyond the
initial orbit of the outermost planet. Here, the instability is delayed to ∼700 My, consistent with the
timing of the Late Heavy Bombardment of the terrestrial planets
If the planetesimal disk resides beyond the orbit of Neptune, the interactions between the
planets and the disk are necessarily much weaker than in the case where the planets are embed-
ded in the disk. In this condition, the instability can occur late, after a time comparable with the
LHB chronology, as shown in >Fig. 2-9. The instability time depends critically on the location
of the inner edge of the disk: Disks with inner edges slightly closer to Neptune lead to early
instabilities, and disks with edges just a bit further give systems that are stable forever.6 Such
extreme sensitivity looks problematic.
All the simulations presented up to this point, however, were simple, because they assumed
that the planetesimals do not to interact dynamically with each other. If self-interactions are
taken into account, for instance assuming that there are a few hundreds Pluto-mass objects in
the disk perturbing each other and the other particles, then there is a net exchange of energy
between the planets and the disk, even ifthere are noclose encounters between planets and plan-
etesimals. This is because the self-stirring of the disk breaks the reversibility of the eccentricity
coupling between planet and planetesimals: The planet eccentricities are damped; however, the
evolutions of orbital energy and eccentricity are coupled at second order in the masses (Milani
et al. 1987): This produces a drift in the planet’s energy. In particular, the planets lose energy,
i.e., they try to migrate toward the Sun (Levison et al. 2011). The orbits of the planets tend to
approach each other. This is different from the case where planets scatter planetesimals, and the
planetary orbits tend to separatefrom each other. Remember,though, that the planets are in res-
onances, so the ratios between their semimajor axes cannot change. In response, the planetary
6The situation was not nearly as sensitive in Gomes et al. (2005), because the planets were not assumed to be
in resonance with each other.

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
eccentricities slowly increase. This eventually drives some planets to pass through secondary
or secular resonances, which destabilize the original multi-resonant configuration. The over-
all evolution is very similar to what is presented in >Fig. 2-9, but now, the instability time is
late in general: In the simulations of Levison et al. (2011), it ranges from 350 My to over 1 Gy
for disks with inner edge ranging from 15.5 to 20 AU (Neptune is at ∼11.5 AU in these simula-
tions). Unlike the case without self-interactions ofdisk particles, there is noapparent correlation
between instability time and initial location of the inner edge of the disk. This may appear sur-
prising, because the rate of energy exchange between planets and disk decreases with increasing
distance of the disk’s inner edge. However, this dependence is weak, because the planet-disk
interaction is a distant interaction (no close encounters are involved). Then, the expected mono-
tonic dependence of the instability time on the disk’s distance can be easily erased by the fact
that the evolutions of the disk and of the planets are chaotic, which gives a highly sensitive
and nontrivial dependence of the results on the initial conditions. The instability time seems
to depend weakly also on the number of Pluto-mass scatterers in the disk, provided that this
number exceeds a few hundreds.
Together, the papers by Morbidelli et al. (2007) and Levison et al. (2011) build the new
version of the “Nice model.” This is much superior than its original version (Tsiganis et al. 2005;
Gomes et al. 2005) because (i) it removes the arbitrary character of the initial conditions of the
planets by adopting as initial configuration one of the end states of hydrodynamical simulations
and (ii) it removes the sensitive dependence of the instability time on the location of the inner
edge of the disk; instead, a late instability seems to be a generic outcome.
In the new Nice model, only 10% of the simulations which exhibit a global dynamical insta-
bility of the planets lead to a stable four-planets system at the end; in the remaining simulations,
one or more planets are lost, ejected onto hyperbolic orbits. The fraction of “successful” simula-
tions in the original work of Tsiganis et al. (2005) was much higher: ∼50%. This is because in the
new model, the planets are initially in a more compact configuration, and therefore their orbital
instability is more violent. This low probability of success may suggests that the model is still
missing something important in the reconstruction of the past history of the solar system. For
instance, the solar system might have originally had three Neptune-mass planets, one of which
was ejected at the time of the instability (Nesvorný 2011). In this case, the fraction of successful
simulations (e.g., those ending with four giant planets) increases considerably.
On the positive side, like in Tsiganis et al., when four planets survive in the new Nice
model, their final orbits are quite similar to the real ones: The orbital semimajor axes are within
10–15% of the real values, and the final orbital eccentricities and inclinations are also close
(within a factor of 2) to the actual ones. This argues that the model, although certainly not
perfect, is probably not too far from reality. The match between the final orbits in the simula-
tions and the current real orbits of the giant planets improves in the model assuming that the
solar system had originally three Neptune-mass planets and eventually lost one (Nesvorný and
Morbidelli 2012).
3.4 The Solar System Debris Disk: Are LHBs Common?
If our understanding of the evolution of the solar system is (even approximately) correct,
there should have been a massive belt of planetesimals outside Neptune’s orbit during the first
∼600 My of history, i.e., up to the LHB time. This disk, through mutual collisions, should have
produced a large amount of dust, generating what it is usually referred to as a “debris disk”

Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems 2

(Chapter by Moro-Martin). It is interesting to investigate how our debris disk would have
appeared to an extrasolar observer and compare the result to the debris disks that inferred
around other stars of various ages.
Booth et al. (2009) addressed this question. The intrinsic collision probabilities and mutual
velocities among the planetesimals have been computed from the dynamical simulations of
the Nice model (in its old version, but this should not make a big difference in this respect).
To compute the outcome of the collisional activity, Booth et al. had to assume an initial size
distribution. They adopted the size distribution observed in the current Kuiper belt, with the
numberofobjects in each size bin multiplied bya factor∼1,000. Thus, the initial size distribution
contained ∼1,000 Pluto-size bodies was relatively steep down to D ∼km and then turned
over to a shallower slope for sizes smaller than this threshold (Bernstein et al. 2004; Fuentes and
Holman 2008). With this assumption, a planetesimal disk with initially 50 M⊕of material loses
less than 50% of its mass in 600 My because of collisional grinding (see also the supplementary
material of Levison et al. 2009). This is an important consistency check for the Nice model: In
fact, if collisional grinding rapidly removed most of the mass of the disk no matter the initial size
distribution, then there would not be enough mass to affect the evolution of the giant planets
at the LHB time.
After having computed the dust production rate as a function of time and the orbital and
size distributions of the grains, Booth et al. computed the emission of the disk at wavelengths
of 24 and 70 µm, relative to the emission of the Sun. The result is illustrated in > Fig. 2-10.
It shows that the luminosity of the debris disk should have decayed very slowly, by less than
an order of magnitude, during the time preceding the onset of the planetary instability (which
occurred at 880 My in the specific simulation of the Nice model used in their calculation). Then,
the luminosity should have decayed very rapidly below detectability, as the disk was dynami-
cally dispersed by the planets. The figure also shows, with star symbols, the infrared excess of
known stars, as a function of their estimated ages. At 24 µm, only ∼15% of the stars younger
than 300 My have this kind of excess (Carpenter et al. 2009), and this fraction decreases to a
few percent for older stars (Gáspár et al. 2009); at 70 µm, the fraction of stars with detectable
infrared excess does not seem to decay with age (Hillenbrand et al. 2008; Trilling et al. 2008).
A first important conclusion, from the comparison of the estimated brightness of our solar
system with the IR excess of other stars, is that, before the LHB, our debris disk was fairly typical.
A second conclusion, from the fact that there is no general tendency for a sudden disappearance
of the IR excess at 70 µm around other stars at about 1 Gy of age, is that a complete dynamical
clearing of the planetesimal disk like the one that occurred in our solar system at the LHB time
is fairly atypical. From a statistical analysis of the data, Booth et al. estimated that at most 15%
of the extrasolar systems undergo such a late dynamical clearing.
The fact that a late complete dynamical clearing of the planetesimal disk is a rare event
should not be a big surprise. In fact, it is clear from what has been said above that the events
described in the Nice model depend on two specific properties that not many planetary systems
might have in common with our own. First, the planets in our system did not migrate perma-
nently into the inner solar system; instead, they remained or returned near their birth places,
i.e., adjacent to the planetesimal disk that generated them. Thus, when their orbits changed at
the time of the instability, they strongly affected the disk. If the planets had migrated close to
the Sun and had remained there, they would have lost contact with the distant planetesimal
disk. Even if the planets had become unstable in the inner solar system, probably, the distant
disk would not have been dynamically cleared. Second, the planetesimal disk of the solar system
was small, presumably truncated at ∼30 AU (Gomes et al. 2004). If the planetesimal disk had

solid line shows the luminosity of the disk relative to that of the Sun at 24 µm (top) and 70 µm
(bottom). The luminosity decays slowly during the ﬁrst 880 My, when the planets become unstable
(in the adopted simulation). Then, the luminosity of the disk rapidly decays, as the planetesi-
mals are removed from the solar system. The horizontal dashed line shows the detection limit
for an extrasolar observer with our current measurement capabilities. The asterisks represent the

evolution around the instability time (from Booth et al. (2009))
been extendedto much larger distances, the dynamical instability and the migration of Neptune
would have probably cleared the disk up to 50–100 AU; beyond this threshold, the disk would
have remained massive and would have continued to produce dust.
Coming back to > Fig. 2-10, the little spike in the disk’s brightness visible at 880 My in
the upper plot (magnified in the box in the bottom left corner) is the signature of the LHB
event, due to a burst in collisional activity that occurs as the disk starts to be dispersed and
its orbital excitation suddenly increases. As one can see, the spike is not prominent enough to
make the disk stand out of the natural distribution of brightness of disks of different masses
(suggested by the dispersion of the observations reported on the top panel of > Fig. 2-10).

93
The Booth et al. calculation, however, does not account for the huge flux of comets into the
inner solar system that should have occurred during the disk dispersal: These comets should
have liberated a great amount of dust once inside a few AUs from the Sun. Nesvorný et al. (2010)
accounted for this effect: They estimated that the inner zodiacal cloud should have been more
than times brighter during the LHB epoch. As the current infrared excess at 24µm of the
zodiacal cloud is × −(Kelsall et al. 1998), the excess at the LHB time at this wavelength
was probably of order 2–10. This kind of excess is comparable to the upper envelope of the
observations. Thus, the conclusion is that luminosity bursts associated to LHB events, totally
invisible at 70 µm (cold dust), start to be detectable at 24 µm (hot dust), although they can
still be confused with the luminosity of massive disks undergoing gradual collisional grinding.
Therefore, the identification of systems that might be undergoing an LHB event at the current
time requires a case by case analysis at multiple wavelengths, as done for instance in Wyatt et al.
(2007).

Terrestrial Planets
Up to this point, this chapter was focussed on the formation and evolution of giant planets. The
discussion below considers the evolution of the terrestrial planets.
Terrestrial planets are expected to form in the inner part of a protoplanetary disk, closer to
the star than the snow line position. Because of the absence of ices and of the relatively small
mass contained in the inner portion of the disk, the largest objects formed by the processes of
runaway and oligarchic growth (see >Sect. 2.1) are expected to have masses of about a lunar to
a Martian mass (Weidenschilling et al. 1997). These bodies are called planetary embryos to dis-
tinguish them from the much more massive planetary cores that are the precursors of the giant
planets. They incorporate about 50% of the mass of solids in the inner disk, the rest remaining
in asteroid-sized planetesimals.
The evolution of the system of embryos and planetesimals has been the object of many simu-
lations using N-body integrations (Chambers and Wetherill 1998; Agnor et al. 1999; Chambers
2001; Raymond et al. 2004, 2005, 2006a, 2007, 2009b; O’Brien et al. 2006; Kenyon and Brom-
ley 2006; Kokubo et al. 2006; Thommes et al. 2008; Morishima et al. 2010; Kokubo and Genda
2010). All studies agree on the basic aspects of the terrestrial-planet accretion process, although
they may differ in the details. At the disappearance of the gas, the system of embryos becomes
violently unstable, due to the mutual interactions among the embryos themselves and to the
“external” perturbations from the giant planets. The orbits of the embryos begin to intersect,
and accretional collisions between embryos start to occur. This produces a smaller number
of more massive objects (see >Fig. 2-11), which are eventually identified with the terrestrial
planets.
Concerning the planetesimals, a fraction of them contributes to the growth of the planets
by colliding with the embryos. The majority of the planetesimals, however, are dispersed onto
orbits with large eccentricities and inclinations. In this process (the “dynamical friction” men-
tioned in > Sect. 3.1), they damp the eccentricities and inclinations of the growing planets,
which eventually sets the system into a stable configuration, with the most massive planets on
the least eccentric orbits.
This scenario for the formation of the terrestrial planets of our solar system has several
strong points:

⊡Fig. 2-11
Snapshots of the terrestrial planets formation process, from O’Brien et al. (2006). Each panel shows
the eccentricity vs. semimajor axis distribution of planetary embryos (ﬁlled circles) and planetesi-
mals (crosses) at the reported time. The size of each ﬁlled circle is proportional to the cubic root of
the mass of the corresponding embryo. The big ﬁlled ball at ∼5.2 AU represents Jupiter. The dashed
curves show the current boundaries of the asteroid belt. Notice the formation of three terrestrial
planets in this simulation, the biggest of which is approximately one Earth mass. In the asteroid
belt, no terrestrial planet is formed. All embryos have left the asteroid belt region and only a small
fraction of the initial planetesimals reside there on excited orbits. In these simulations, all colli-
sions are supposed to be accretional. This approximation has been recently removed by Kokubo
and Genda (2010), who considered a database of collisions simulated by the SPH method (like in
Agnor and Asphaug 2004; Asphaug et al. 2006) to determine how much mass is accreted or ejected
in each collisional event. The ﬁnal results, though, show very little diﬀerences with respect to the
simulations that treat all collisions as 100% accretional
•
A system of two to five planets is typically formed. The efficiency of the accretion process
is about 50%. Thus, starting with ∼M⊕in embryos and planetesimals typically produces
a couple of planets of about an Earth mass each (Chambers 2001). The final orbits of the
terrestrial planets produced in the simulations are comparable to those of the real terrestrial
planets of our solar system, if the dynamical friction process is properly taken into account
(O’Brien et al. 2006).

•
Quasi-tangent collisions of Mars-mass embryos onto the protoplanets are quite frequent
(Agnor et al. 1999). These collisions are expected to generate a disk of ejecta around the
protoplanets (Canup and Asphaug 2001), from which a satellite is likely to accrete (Canup
and Esposito 1996). This is the standard, generally accepted scenario for the formation of
the Moon.
•
The accretion timescale of the Earth analog in the simulations is 30–100 My. This is in
the good ballpark with the chronology of Earth accretion as indicated by radioactive
chronometers, which still has a comparable uncertainty (Kleine et al. 2009).
•
In many/most simulations, terrestrial planets do not form in the asteroid belt. Instead, all
the embryos are removed by mutual interactions and perturbations from Jupiter. A small
fraction (a few percent) of the planetesimal population is left behind on stable asteroid-belt
orbits, with eccentricities and inclinations comparable to those of the real asteroids (Petit
et al. 2001; O’Brien et al. 2007).
•
A significant fraction (∼10–20%) of the mass of the terrestrial planets is accreted from
the outer part of the asteroid belt, which provides a formidable mechanism to explain the
delivery of water to the Earth (Morbidelli et al. 2000; Raymond et al. 2004, 2007).
On the other hand, this scenario has a major problem: The planet formed in the simulations
at the location of Mars is typically too massive (Chambers 2001; Raymond et al. 2009a; Hansen
2009; Morishima et al. 2010). Mars is an oddity not only for its relatively low mass but also
for its accretion timescale: In fact, it formed in only a few millions years, like asteroids, and
significantly faster than the Earth (Dauphas and Pourmand 2011).
There does not seem to be a simple solution to the Mars problem (Raymond et al. 2009a).
Hansen (2009) argued convincingly that a correct mass distribution of the terrestrial planets,
with an Earth/Mars mass ratio of ∼10, can be achieved only if the initial disk of embryos and
planetesimals is assumedto have an outer edge at about 1 AU. The problem is how to justify such
an edge and how to reconcile this with the evidence that asteroids exist in the 2–4 AU range.
The simulations that assume Jupiter and Saturn initially on orbits with their current separation
in semimajoraxis but eccentricities twotothree times largerdoproduce veryrapidlyan effective
edge at ∼1.5 AU in the distribution of embryos and planetesimals (Raymond et al. 2009a; Mor-
ishima et al. 2010) and result in a somewhat small “Mars.” However, this initial configuration of
the giant planets is inconsistent with our understanding of their orbital evolution through the
history of the solar system, described above (see > Sects. 2.4, 3.2 and 3.3). Moreover, none of
these simulations are without problems: Mars is often not small enough, the final distribution
of bodies in the asteroid belt is not good, water is not delivered to the terrestrial planets, etc.
4.1 Linking Giant Planet Migration to Terrestrial Planet Accretion:
The Grand Tack Scenario
The result by Hansen motivated Walsh et al. (2011) to look in more details at the possible orbital
history of the giant planets and their ability to sculpt the disk in the inner solar system. For the
first time, the giant planets were not assumed to be on static orbits (even if different from the
current ones); instead, Walsh et al. studied the coevolution of the orbits of the giant planets and
of the precursors of the terrestrial planets, during the era of the disk of gas.
Walsh et al. envisioned the following scenario, based on the considerations reported
in >Sect. 2.2: First, Jupiter migrated inward while Saturn was still growing; then, when Saturn

96 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
reached a mass close to its current one, it started to migrate inward more rapidly than Jupiter,
until it captured the latter in the 2/3 resonance; finally, the two planets migrated outward until
the complete disappearance of the disk of gas. The extent of the inward and outward migra-
tions cannot be estimated a priori, because they depend on properties of the disk and of giant
planet accretion that are unknown, such as the time lag between Jupiter and Saturn formation,
the speed of inward migration (depending on disk’s viscosity), the speed of outward migration
(depending on disk’s scale height), the time lag between the capture in resonance of Jupiter and
Saturn, and the photo-evaporation of the gas. However, the extent of the inward and outward
migrations of Jupiter can be deduced by looking at the resulting structure of the inner solar sys-
tem. In particular, Walsh et al. remarked that a reversal of Jupiter’s migration at 1.5 AU would
provide a natural explanation for the existence of the outer edge at 1 AU of the inner disk of
embryos and planetesimals, required to produce a small Mars (see >Fig. 2-12). Because of the
prominent inward-then-outward migration of Jupiter that it assumes, Walsh et al. scenario is
nicknamed “Grand Tack.”
Several giant extrasolar planets have been discovered orbiting their star at a distance of
1–2 AU, so the idea that Jupiter was sometime in the past at 1.5 AU from the Sun is not shock-
ing by itself. A crucial diagnostic of this scenario, though, is the survival of the asteroid belt.
Given that Jupiter should have migrated through the asteroid belt region twice, first inward
and, then outward, one could expect that the asteroid belt should now be totally empty. How-
ever, the numerical simulations by Walsh et al. show that the asteroid belt is first fully depleted
by the passage of the giant planets, but then, while Jupiter leaves the region for the last time, it is
repopulated by a small fraction of the planetesimals scattered by the giant planets during their
⊡Fig. 2-12

the system (form “NEWS&ANALYSIS”: Science, 332, 1255 (2011))

migration. In particular, the inner asteroid belt is dominantly repopulated by planetesimals that
were originally inside the orbit on which Jupiter formed, while the outer part of the asteroid belt
is dominantly repopulated by planetesimals originally in between and beyond the orbits of the
giant planets (see >Fig. 2-12).
Assuming that Jupiter accreted at the location of the snow line, it is then tempting to iden-
tify the planetesimals originally closer to the Sun with the un-hydrous asteroids of S type and
those originally in between and beyond the orbits of the giant planets with the “primitive”
C-type asteroids. With this assumption, the Grand Tack scenario explains the physical struc-
ture of the asteroid belt probably better than any other previous model. In fact, the asteroid
belt is characterized by a radial gradient in asteroid spectroscopic types (Gradie and Tedesco
1982): The inner belt is dominated S type (usually considered to be the parent bodies of ordi-
nary chondrites; Binzel et al. 1996) and the outer belt by C-type asteroids (usually considered
to be the parent bodies of carbonaceous chondrites; (Burbine et al. 2000)), although there is
a significant overlapping between the distributions of these different types of asteroids. It is
difficult to explain the differences between ordinary chondrite and carbonaceous chondrite
parent bodies if they had both formed in the asteroid belt region, given that they are coeval
(Villeneuve et al. 2009) and that the radial extent of the asteroid belt is small (∼1 AU only).
Instead, if ordinary and carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies have been implanted into the
asteroid belt from originally well separated reservoirs, as in the Grand Tack scenario, the
differences in physical properties are easier to understand in the framework of the classical
condensation sequence. The origin of C-type asteroids from the giant planet region would also
explain, in a natural way, the similarities with comets that are emerging from recent observa-
tional results and sample analysis (see Sect. 7 of the supplementary material of Walsh et al. 2011,
for a in-depth discussion). The small mass of the asteroid belt and its eccentricity and inclination
distribution are also well reproduced by the Grand Tack scenario.
This scenario also explains why the accretion timescales of Mars and the asteroids are com-
parable (Dauphas and Pourmand 2011). In fact, the asteroids stopped accreting when they got
dispersed and injected onto excited orbits of the main belt; Mars stopped accreting when the
inner disk was truncated at 1 AU and the planet was pushed beyond this edge by an encounter
with the proto-Earth (Hansen 2009). In the Grand Tack scenario, these two events coincide and
mark the time of the passage of Jupiter through the inner solar system.
All these results make the Grand Tack scenario an appealing comprehensive model of
terrestrial-planet formation and argue strongly in favor of an evolution of the giant planets of
our solar system like that sketched in the right panel of >Fig. 2-6.
4.2 Terrestrial Planets in Extrasolar Systems
Given that the architecture of the giant planets in our solar system is far from being typi-
cal around other stars, it is interesting to investigate the dependence of the terrestrial-planet
accretion process on the properties of giant planets, across a wide range of parameters.
From various simulations (Levison and Agnor 2003; Raymond et al. 2004, 2006a), it turns
out that the outcome of the terrestrial-planet formation process has a weak dependence on
the mass of the giant planets. Obviously, the terrestrial planets cannot form in the vicinity of
giants. So, if the giant planets are closer to the star than Jupiter, they leave to the terrestrial-
planets a narrower niche to form inside. Instead, the process of terrestrial planets accretion is
very sensitive on the eccentricities of the giant planets. Large eccentricities of the giant planets

98 2
Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems
force large eccentricities on embryos and planetesimals. As a result, the final terrestrial planets
will be more eccentric; consequently, they will have a larger separation in semimajor axis and
will be less numerous and more massive compared to a simulation where the same giant planets
are on circular orbits. Moreover, the planetesimals originally in the vicinity of the giant planets
(presumably rich in waterand other volatiles) are more likely to be ejected from the system than
to collide with the terrestrial planets, if the giant planets are eccentric (Chambers and Cassen
2002; Raymond et al. 2004). So, the resulting terrestrial planets are expected to be water-poor.
The works quoted above assumed giant planets on “fixed” orbits. We know now that the giant
planets can have evolutions that lead them to change their orbits, through migration and/or
dynamical instabilities. It is interesting to explore how the terrestrial planets, during and after
their formation, respond to these changes.
The effect of a Jupiter-mass planet migrating through the disk toward a “hot-Jupiter” orbit
has been investigated in Fogg and Nelson (2005, 2007) and Raymond et al. (2006b). These stud-
ies showed that a large fraction of the disk’s solid mass survives the inward migration of the giant
planet in two ways: (i) Planetesimals are captured into mean-motion resonances interior to the
orbit of the giant planet and, by mutual collisions, give origin to massive terrestrial planets. (ii)
Planetesimals are scattered into external orbits, where gas drag re-circularizes their orbits. The
standard terrestrial-planet formation process then resumes. Thus, the widespread expectation
that terrestrial-planets could not exist in systems with a hot Jupiter is not correct, and future
searches for extrasolar terrestrial planets should not disregard these systems a priori.
4.3 Terrestrial-Planets Evolution During Giant Planets Instabilities
The issue of terrestrial-planet evolution during giant planets instabilities deserves a whole sec-
tion by itself. As proposed in >Sect. 3.3, the giant planets of our solar system passed through
a phase of orbital instability ∼3.9 Gy ago, i.e., well after the formation of the terrestrial planets
(which ended ∼4.5 Gy ago; Kleine et al. 2009). During this instability phase, close encounters
between the giant planets occurred, the orbits of the giant planets became eccentric, and their
separation in semimajor axis increased toward the current values. During this period of chaotic
evolution, a wide variety of orbital histories are possible. One may, however, classify the orbital
histories in two classes: those in which Jupiter is not involved in close encounters with another
planet (only Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have encounters with each other) and those in which
Jupiter has encounters with Uranus and/or Neptune (nicknamed below the jumping-Jupiter
class). The two classes give a very different evolution of the orbital separation of Jupiter and
Saturn.
In the first class ofevolutions, the increase in orbital separation between Jupiterand Saturn is
due toplanetesimal-driven migration. In fact, ifSaturn scatters an ice giant (Uranus orNeptune)
while Jupiter does not, necessarily, Saturn has to scatter the ice giant outward and recoil toward
the Sun. So, planetary encounters in this class of evolutions lead to a reduction of the orbital
separation of Jupiter, and Saturn and planetesimal-driven migration is the only mechanism
that can increase it. In the jumping-Jupiter class of evolutions, most of the increase in orbital
separation between the two gas giants is instead due to planetary encounters. In fact, if Jupiter
has an encounter with an ice giant, said ice giant, given that it is beyond the orbit of Saturn both
at the beginning and at the end of the evolution, must be first scattered inward by Saturn and
then be scattered outward by Jupiter. Thus, Saturn recoils outward and Jupiter inward, which
increases the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn.

In summary, both classes of evolutions lead to an increase in the orbital separation of
Jupiter and Saturn, but the big difference is in the timescale on which this separation occurs.
Planetesimal-driven migration is relatively slow: It forces the orbital separation to evolve expo-
nentially as Δa(t) = Δacurrent −Δexp(−t/τ), with τ ∼−My (the characteristic lifetime
of planetesimals crossing the orbits of the giant planets, such as the Centaur objects; Tiscareno
and Malhotra 2003; di Sisto and Brunini 2007; Bailey and Malhotra 2009). Conversely, the phase
of planetary encounters is short, so that in the jumping-Jupiter class, the orbital separation of
Jupiter and Saturn increases in less than year (see >Fig. 2-13).
The increase in orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn changes the secular frequen-
cies of the orbits of these planets. If the divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn occurs on
a timescale of a few millions of years, as in the case of planetesimal-driven migration, the
orbits of the terrestrial planets are quite strongly excited in eccentricity (Brasser et al. 2009).
Even if starting from circular orbits, the Earth and Venus acquire orbits whose eccentricity
oscillations exceed 0.15, i.e., twice as much as in the real solar system; Mercury is destabilized
(> Fig. 2-14). This happens because the frequency of precession of the perihelion of Jupiter’s
orbit, denoted by g, decreases, and, in sequence, it becomes equal to those of Mars, Earth,
Venus, and Mercury (g, . . ., g), respectively; every time that a frequency of a terrestrial planet
gk is equal to g, a secular resonance occurs and the eccentricity of the corresponding planet is
strongly affected. Similarly, most of the asteroids in the inner part of the asteroid belt are desta-
bilized while the precession frequency of the perihelion of the orbit of Saturn (g) decreases;
consequently, the final orbital distribution of the asteroids is incompatible with the one cur-
rently observed (Morbidelli et al. 2010). In the jumping-Jupiter class of evolutions, conversely,

the semimajor axes of Jupiter and Saturn, reported in the left-side and right-side vertical scales,
respectively. The stochastic behavior is caused by encounters with a Uranus-Neptune-mass planet,
originally placed the third in order of increasing distance from the Sun (not shown here). Time t = 0
here is arbitrary and corresponds to the onset of the phase of planetary instability. The full evolu-
tion of the planets, which lasts 4.6 My, is illustrated in Fig. 4 of Brasser et al. (2009). All giant planets
survived the full 4.6 My simulation on stable orbits, quite similar to those of the real planets of the
solar system

The evolutions of the eccentricities of Mars (red), Earth (blue), Venus (orange) and Mercury (grey),
during planetesimal-drive migration of Jupiter and Saturn. Here the orbital separation between
the two gas giants increases as Δacurrent −Δ0 exp(−t/τ), with Δ0 = 1.1 AU and τ = 5 My
these problems do not exist because the divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn – and the
consequent decrease of gand g– is so fast that the eccentricities of asteroids and terrestrial
planets have no time to be seriously affected. Thus, the terrestrial planets can have at the end
orbital eccentricities as small (or even smaller) than the current ones, depending on their ini-
tial conditions (Brasser et al. 2009), and the asteroid belt preserves roughly the orbital structure
acquired during terrestrial-planets formation (Morbidelli et al. 2010).
The conclusion is that the real evolution of the giant planets of our solar system had to be of
the jumping-Jupiter class; otherwise, the orbit of the Earth, and the structure of the inner solar
system in general, would be substantially different from what they are now.
There is no doubt that many evolutions of the giant planets can be fatal for the formation or
the evolution of habitable terrestrial planets. Take the giant extrasolar planets discovered so far:
Most of them have very eccentric orbits, which are thought to be the product of a violent insta-
bility occurred in the original planetary system, which led to close encounters between giant
planets (see >Sect. 2.3). Raymond et al. (2011) show that when giant planets acquire similarly
large eccentricities, the terrestrial planets in the system are forced to evolve onto orbits with
extreme eccentricities: Many of them collide with the central star or start to intersect the orbits
of the giant planets and are then rapidly ejected onto hyperbolic orbits. Those terrestrial objects
which manage to survive, if any, do so on orbits with eccentricities that can be hardly compatible
with habitable worlds. Thus, the existence of an habitable Earth in our system is possible only
because our giant planets remained on orbits with exceptionally small eccentricities compared
to the orbits of extrasolar planets.

Conclusions
This chapter discussed the evolution of planetary systems. The emphasis was directed at recon-
structing the history of our system using computer simulations and taking advantage of all
possible detailed constraints (the orbits of the planets, the architecture of the populations of
small bodies, radioactive chronologies for terrestrial-planet formation, crater records, etc.).
Although imperfect, this view of the evolution of the solar system after the completion of giant
planets formation has reached a quite satisfactory level of coherence. Conversely, the phase of
accretion of the giant planets remains poorly modeled.
According to our understanding, the evolution of the solar system was characterized by
three main “eras.” In the gas-disk era, Jupiter had a wide-range radial migration. It first migrated
inward; then, when it was at about 1.5 AU from the Sun, it got caught in resonance with Saturn,
and, given the Jupiter/Saturn mass ratio, it started to migrate outward (Walsh et al. 2011). This
inward-then-outward migration explains why the solar system does not have a “hot (or warm)
Jupiter.” It alsoleft indelible traces in the innersolarsystem, particularlyin the physical structure
of the asteroid belt and the small mass of Mars. As a result of the outward migration of Jupiter,
the four giant planets acquired a multi-resonant configuration, in which each planet was in
a mean-motion resonance with its neighbor. The orbits of the giant planets were at the time
much closer to each other than they are now and had significantly smaller eccentricities and
inclinations.
At the disappearance of the gas, the system entered in the planetesimal-disk era. The Earth
and Venus completed their accretion from a disk of planetary embryos and planetesimals that
inherited an outer edge at 1 AU from the earlier incursion of Jupiter into the inner solar system.
The accretion of Mars and of the asteroids was frozen. Instead, a massive disk of planetesi-
mals persisted outside the orbit of the outermost giant planet. Its internal collisional activity
produced a debris disk comparable to those observed around ∼15% of main-sequence stars.
Meanwhile, the gravitational interactions between the giant planets and this disk slowly mod-
ified the resonant orbits of the former. Eventually, ∼600 My later, the giant planets became
unstable, as a result of these slow orbital modifications. The chaotic phase that followed reshuf-
fled the structure of the outer solar system: The giant planets acquired their current orbits; most
of the distant planetesimal disk was dispersed, and the Kuiper belt is what remains today of
that disk (Levison et al. 2008; Batygin et al. 2011). Many asteroids were also released from the
asteroid belt. All these destabilized small bodies caused the Late Heavy Bombardment of the
terrestrial planets (Bottke et al. 2011).
With this profound reorganization, the solar system entered into the current era, lasting
since ∼3.8 Gy ago, in which it did not suffer any further significant change.
If this story is true, then the evolution of our solar system was defined by a sequence of
specific features. For instance, the mass ratio between Jupiter and Saturn prevented migration
toward the Sun; the late formation of the giant planets relative to the gas-disk lifetime prevented
Saturn to grow more massive than Jupiter; the instability phase that characterized the giant
planets resulted in a jumping-Jupiter evolution, which prevented secular resonances to interfere
with the orbits of the terrestrial planets; etc. It was then natural in this chapter to discuss what
would have happened if these events had not occurred or if they had occurred differently. This
addresses the origin of diversity in extrasolar planetary systems. The possible lines of evolutions
described here certainly do not exhaust all possibilities: Nature has much more fantasy than we
have. However, they show that the evolution of a planetary system, like the weather on Earth,

is so sensitive on initial and environmental conditions that a huge variety of outcomes is
possible, even starting from similar situations.
A frequently asked question, at this point, is whether or not one can predict the probability
that a system evolves toward one state or another. The answer at this time, unfortunately, is no.
The first stages of planet formation are still poorly understood, including the initial conditions
or the properties of protoplanetary disks. Predicting which kinds of planetary systems could
be formed and with which probabilities is still out of reach, and without this information, one
cannot estimate the probabilities of the subsequent possible evolutions. For instance, the ques-
tion of why Jupiter and Saturn formed like they are, instead of having different masses or having
additional gas-giant companions, is still difficult to answer. In other words, the evolution of the
solar system can be reconstructed using all available clues and constraints, but this does not suf-
fice to “predict” our solar system, a priori. This quandary has a parallel with geology. Geologists
are able to reconstruct the complicated history of our continents with an amazing precision,
but they are not able to say what is the probability that a terrestrial planet develops conti-
nents with the properties of our own continents. At this time, the field of “origins” in planetary
science is essentially a descriptive discipline. As such, it is led by observations and interpreted
by theoretical models, not the other way around.

Abstract:
The four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and Earth’s Moon
display similar compositions, interior structures, and geologic histories. The terrestrial planets
formed by accretion ∼4.5 Ga ago out of the solar nebula, whereas the Moon formed through
accretion of material ejected off Earth during a giant impact event shortly after Earth formed.
Geophysical investigations (gravity anomalies, seismic analysis, heat flow measurements, and
magnetic field studies) reveal that all five bodies have differentiated into a low-density silicate
crust, an intermediate density silicate mantle, and an iron-rich core. Seismic and heat flow
measurements are only available for Earth and its Moon, and only Earth and Mercury cur-
rently exhibit actively produced magnetic fields (although Mars and the Moon retain remanent
fields). Surface evolutions of all five bodies have been influenced by impact cratering, volcanism,
tectonism, and mass wasting. Aeolian activity only occurs on bodies with a substantial atmo-
sphere (Venus, Earth, and Mars) and only Earth and Mars display evidence of fluvial and glacial
processes. Earth’s volcanic and tectonic activity is largely driven by plate tectonics, whereas
those processes on Venus result from vertical motions associated with hotspots and mantle
upwellings. Mercury displays a unique tectonic regime of global contraction caused by gradual
solidification of its large iron core. Early large impact events stripped away much of Mercury’s
crust and mantle, produced Venus’ slow retrograde rotation, ejected material off Earth that
became the Moon, and may have created the Martian hemispheric dichotomy. The similari-
ties and differences between the interiors and surfaces of these five bodies provide scientists
with a better understanding of terrestrial planet evolutionary paths.

Introduction
Terrestrial planets are those which resemble Earth: small, rocky, and close to the Sun. The four
terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, although Earth’s Moon is often included
in these discussions. Solid surfaces of these five objects reveal the geologic processes which have
shaped these bodies. These processes can be divided into endogenic (originating from inside the
body) and exogenic (originating outside of the surface). Endogenic processes include volcanism
and tectonism, which result from a body’s internal heat, and mass wasting, which results from

Terrestrial Planets 3
113
the planet’s gravity. Exogenic processes include aeolian (wind), fluvial (movement of liquids),
glacial (movement of ice), and impact cratering processes. Endogenic processes and impact
cratering have affected all of the terrestrial planets, but aeolian processes are only seen on bodies
with an atmosphere (Venus, Earth, and Mars) and fluvial/glacial processes only occur on bodies
with an atmosphere and the right temperature range (Earth and Mars).
Planetary surfaces and interiors are often described using the technique of comparative
planetology, which extends ourunderstanding ofprocesses on Earth tootherplanets. This chap-
ter will first describe the surface and interior of the Earth and then apply this understanding
to the other terrestrial planets. The amount of geologic activity on terrestrial planets is dictated
by the body’s size (>Fig. 3-1) – large objects retain internal heat for longer periods of time and
thus remain geologically active longer than smaller bodies. Earth, being the largest of the ter-
restrial planets, is the most geologically active, followed by Venus and Mars. Mercury and the
Moon are geologically dying or dead worlds at the present time, although their surfaces retain
evidence of activity early in their histories.
Geologic processes affecting terrestrial planet surfaces can be directly observed by orbiting
and landed spacecraft. Interior structure, however, must be inferred remotely by geophysical
techniques: analysis of how mass variations affect orbiting spacecraft through changes in gravi-
tational attraction, seismic studies of how energy travels through the planet’s interior, heat flow
measurements, and analysis of any present or past magnetic field. Seismic analysis gives the
most detailed view of a planetary interior, but such data are lacking except for Earth and the
Moon. Heat flow measurements also are currently limited to Earth and the Moon, and only
Earth and Mercury have active magnetic fields at present (although Mars and the Moon appar-
ently had magnetic fields early in their histories). Thus most of our information about planetary
interiors comes from gravity analysis of trajectory variations of orbiting spacecraft.
Gravity analysis investigates variations in gravitational potential (U) measured by orbiting
spacecraft (Hubbard 1984). U is related to the mass of the body (M) and the distance of the
spacecraft from the center of the body (r) through
U = −GM
r

where G is the universal gravitational constant (G = .×−mkg−s−). The gravitational
potential outside of the planet’s surface satisfies Laplace’s equation since the planet’s entire mass
lies inside of the surface:

where R is the radius of the planet, θ is the colatitude (θ = 90○-latitude), λ is longitude, and
Pm
l are Legendre polynomials. The index l is called the degree and indicates the rate at which
the gravitational potential varies in latitude, whereas m is the order and indicates the variation
of U in longitude. Coefficients Clm and Slm are tesseral harmonics and provide information
on variations in mass distribution within the planet. Clo values are called zonal harmonics
since they provide information about mass distributions parallel to the equator, and Slo values
(sectoral harmonics) define mass distributions perpendicular to the equator. Tesseral harmon-
ics can be thought of as a grid pattern subdividing the planet into blocks of mass distributions.
A finer grid pattern is obtained with higher values of l and m, resulting in greater detail about
the distribution of mass within the planet’s interior. Gravity analysis for Earth is completed to
degree and order 2,159, meaning the Earth is subdivided into 2,159 zones parallel to the equa-
tor and 2,159 sectors perpendicular to the equator. This results in Earth being divided into
(2,159)= , , small blocks over which variations in shape and mass can be determined.
The gravity fields for the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are known to degree and order 165,
25, 180, and 85, respectively.
The Clo nomenclature for zonal harmonics is often replaced by Jl in geophysical applica-
tions. Jdescribes the equatorial bulge produced by the planet’s rotation. Jis related to the
body’s mass (M), radius (R), and three principal moments of inertia (A < B < C):
MRJ≈C −A ≈C −B
C is the maximum moment of inertia and corresponds to the body’s rotation axis (as long
as the rotation is not chaotic). A and B are the moments of inertia perpendicular to C and to
each other and pass through the body’s equator. A and B are approximately equal for planets
and moons which have acquired an approximately spherical shape. Precession is the changing
direction that a planet’s rotation axis points relative to the stars and is caused by gravitational
perturbations from other solar system bodies acting on the planet’s equatorial bulge. The rate
of precession (H) of a planet’s rotation axis is given by
H = C −A
C
Thus, measuring the values of Jand H allows determination of the specific values of C and
A (and B since B ≈A). The value of C/MRis of particular interest in planetary geophysics
because it provides insights into the size of a central core. The C/MRvalue of a homogenous
sphere is 0.4. C/MR< 0.4 implies central condensation, and a smaller value of C/MRindicates
a larger core. Thus gravity analysis obtained by orbiting spacecraft provides information about
the planet’s shape (from variations in the value of U expected for a perfect sphere), near-surface
mass distributions (from U), and interior structure (from C/MR).
Radiometric age dating of meteorites indicates that the Solar System formed ∼4.5 Ga ago
from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust (the solar nebula). The Sun’s heat drove volatile-rich

material to the outer solar system, resulting in the terrestrial planets forming from primarily
volatile-poor rocky materials. Condensation temperatures through the solar nebula explain the
small size, rocky compositions, and lack of extensive atmospheres for the terrestrial planets.
Volatiles currently seen on Earth and Mars are from a combination of hydrated minerals incor-
porated into the planets during formation (Drake and Righter 2002) and water provided by
subsequent asteroid and comet impacts (Morbidelli et al. 2000). Terrestrial planets formed by
accretion, where small objects stick together during collisions to form larger objects. As these
planetismals grew more massive, their gravitational pull increased, pulling in more material
until the object became a planetary embryo about the size of Mars. Collisions with other plan-
etismals subsequently altered these planetary embryos, making some planets larger by adding
material (Earth and Venus) and making some smaller through ejection of material into space
(Mercury) (Canup and Agnor 2000).
Accretion converts the kinetic energy of planetismals into heat, therebyincreasing the inter-
nal temperature of the growing planet. Decay of short-lived radioactive elements provides
additional heat. These two heat sources are sufficient to melt a planet within a few million years
after its formation, causing mineral segregation which produces an interior layered structure
(differentiation). Minerals are segregated during differentiation by both their density and their
chemical affinities. Higher density materials sink to the center, forming the planet’s core. Low-
density materials float to the surface to produce the crust, which is separated from the core by
intermediate density materials comprising the mantle. But elements also can display chemical
affinities and follow other elementsregardless of density. Siderophile elementsfollow iron to the
core while lithophile elements follow oxygen and silicon to the crust. Thus gold, silver, iridium,
and platinum tend to be found deep in planetary interiors because of their siderophile nature
whereas aluminum, calcium, and potassium are common in surface rocks because of their
lithophilic properties. Gravity data suggest that all four terrestrial planets and the Moon have
differentiated interior structures with similar compositions: an iron-rich core, an intermediate-
density mantle composed of iron- and magnesium-rich silicates such as olivine, and a crust
composed of silicate minerals rich in aluminum, potassium, and sodium (feldspars). The major
differences in interior structure among the terrestrial planets are the relative sizes of the core,
mantle, and crust and whether planets have solid and/or liquid cores (>Fig. 3-2).

Terrestrial planet interior structure. Geophysical analysis indicates that all four terrestrial planets
and the Moon are diﬀerentiated into a core, mantle, and crust. Mercury’s core is large relative to
that of the other terrestrial planets, suggesting that much of Mercury’s crust and mantle may have
been stripped away by a large impact after diﬀerentiation

Terrestrial Planets
The terms crust, mantle, and core delineate the chemical structure of a planetary interior.
The uppermost portions of the interior (crust and uppermost mantle) also can be divided by
their physical characteristics into the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, com-
posed of the crust and uppermost part of the upper mantle, is the rigid outer layer which
fractures when stresses are applied. The underlying asthenosphere (lower part of the upper
mantle) is warmer and more ductile, causing it to deform under the influence of stress. The
lithosphere and asthenosphere are important divisions when considering plate tectonics and
the formation of multi-ring impact basins.
Terrestrial planet surfaces cooled and solidified shortly after differentiation. The surfaces
began to retain scars of collisions with smaller bodies once they became strong enough. Impact
cratering has been a continuous process throughout solar system history and provides a mech-
anism for determining ages of planetary surface units. Crater density is the number of craters
of a certain diameter and larger per area (in km). Older surfaces have higher crater densities
than younger surfaces (> Fig. 3-3). However, if the present-day cratering rate is extrapolated
back 4.5 Ga, the predicted crater densities underestimate the observed crater densities on sur-
faces older than 3.8 Ga. This indicates that cratering rates were much higher prior to 3.8 Ga and
therefore this period is called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Traditionally the LHB was
proposed to be a gradual decline from extremely high cratering rates at 4.5 Ga resulting from
impact of debris remaining from planet formation. However, analysis of lunar samples returned
by the Apollo and Luna missions and lunar meteorites recovered on Earth revealed that none of

ber 1992, shows the heavily cratered north polar region at lower right and lightly cratered Mare
Imbrium at top. The higher density of impact craters near the north pole indicates this region is
older than Mare Imbrium (NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL))

these samples displayed an age older than ∼4.0 Ga (Kring and Cohen 2002; Stöffler and Ryder
2001; Tera et al. 1974). This suggested that the LHB was actually a spike in impact flux between
about 3.8 and 4.1 Ga, which was named the Lunar Cataclysm.
Recent dynamical modeling provides a possible mechanism for an inner solar system-wide
cataclysm around 3.9 Ga. Numerical modeling suggests the four outer solar system planets
(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed on near-circular orbits closer together than at
present. Gravitational interactions with leftover planetismals caused Jupiter to move inward to
its present position and Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to move outward. As Saturn approached
the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter (where Saturn’s orbital period would be exactly twice that of
Jupiter), it rapidly moved outward, jumping over the 2:1 resonance and forcing Uranus and
Neptune to also move outward. This rapid migration of the outer planets perturbed the remain-
ing planetismals, causing some to move outward to form the Kuiper Belt, and ejecting others
entirely from the solar system (Tsiganis et al. 2005). The migration also perturbed material in
the asteroid belt, causing it to move inward and bombard the inner solar system (Gomes et al.
2005; Strom et al. 2005). Lunar geochemical analysis (Kring and Cohen 2002) and dynamical
modeling of the original mass of the asteroid belt (Bottke et al. 2007) support the hypothesis
that the LHB was produced by this sudden influx of asteroids. Scars of the LHB are seen on
ancient surfaces on the Moon, Mercury, and Mars; recent geologic activity on Venus and Earth
has erased the record from this time period on these planets.

Earth
Earth’s large size (12,742 km diameter) has allowed it to retain substantial internal heat (with
additional contributions from the decay of long-lived radioactive elements) as well as an atmo-
sphere (> Fig. 3-4). The average global heat flux for Earth is 75 milliWatts m−(mW m−),
although this value ranges from near zero in old continental crust to 350 mW m−in volcani-
cally active regions. This heat drives Earth’s volcanic and tectonic activity.
Gravity and seismic analyses reveal that Earth is differentiated into a crust, mantle, liquid
outer core, and solid inner core. The crust is divided into continental and oceanic components
based on composition. Oceanic crust is volcanic in origin, having a basaltic composition with
density near 3,000 kg m−. Oceanic crust is quite thin, being no thicker than about 12 km. Con-
tinental crust is typically about 35 km thick, although its thickness can reach up to 70 km. It
has a generally granitic composition with density near 2,700 kg m−. Seismic waves show a
decrease in velocity at the base of the crust – this region is called the Mohorovicic disconti-
nuity, or Moho. The Moho represents the crust–mantle boundary and corresponds to a change
in rock composition from feldspar-rich rocks in the crust to ultrabasic rocks in the mantle.
The mantle extends to a depth of 2,900 km and is composed of silicate rocks rich in iron
and magnesium, such as olivine, spinel, and peridotite. The mantle is divided into upper and
lower parts, with the upper mantle lying between ∼35 and 660 km depth and the lower man-
tle extending from 660 to 2,900 km depth. Earth’s rigid lithosphere is composed of the crust
and uppermost part of the upper mantle, extending to an average depth of 60 km. The ductile
asthenosphere extends from ∼60 to 200 km depth. Seismic analysis indicates the mantle is solid,
but material is under high enough pressures and temperatures that it can deform in response

tica, the blue of the oceans, and the white clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere. Image was taken by the
Galileo spacecraft in December 1990 (NASA/JPL)
to stresses over long time periods. The mantle–core boundary is represented by a seismic dis-
continuity called the Weichert-Gutenberg discontinuity and represents a transition not only in
composition but also from solid to liquid phase.
Gravity analysis reveals that C/MR= 0.3308, indicating that Earth has a core. Seismic anal-
ysis divides the core into outer and inner parts. Seismic S-waves do not travel through the outer
core, indicating it is liquid. The outer core extends from 2,900 to 5,150 km depth, is composed
of iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements, and has a temperature of
∼5,000 K. The inner core was discovered to be solid through seismic analysis by Inge Lehmann
(1888–1993) in 1936. It has a radius of ∼3,400 km and, like the outer core, is composed primar-
ily of iron with some nickel and traces of light elements. Its temperature is about 6,000 K, but
the high pressure produced by overlying material results in this region being solid.
Convective motions within the liquid outer core give rise to Earth’s magnetic field.The core’s
high temperature ionizes iron atoms, resulting in the free flow of electrons. The resulting time-
varying electric current induces Earth’s magnetic field – this mechanism is called a dynamo.
Earth’s magnetic field strength is characterized by the dipole magnetic moment, which currently
has a value of .× Tm. The magnetic field axis is offset from the rotation axis by 12○,
which means the magnetic poles (identified by a magnetic compass) do not coincide with the
geographicpoles. Acompass needle consists ofa dipole magnet and, bydefinition, the north end
ofthe compass needle’s dipole magnet points toward Earth’s north magneticpole. Since opposite
poles of a magnet attract each other, this means that Earth’s north magnetic pole corresponds

Terrestrial Planets 3
119
to the south pole of Earth’s dipolar magnetic field. Thus, at the present time, the south pole
of Earth’s magnetic field lies in the planet’s northern hemisphere. The orientation of a planet’s
dipole magnetic field is called polarity.
Iron particles in magma align with the magnetic field lines – once magma has solidified
into rock, the orientation of those iron particles is “frozen in,” producing a remanent magnetic
field that does not vary even if the external magnetic field changes. Analysis of iron-rich basaltic
rocks reveals that Earth’s polarity has undergone reversals throughout the planet’s history, with
the last magnetic reversal having occurred about 750,000 years ago. Geophysicists believe that
Earth may be heading toward another polarity reversal because the magnetic field strength is
decreasing about 1% per decade, the magnetic poles are rapidly shifting positions relative to
Earth’s surface, and the magnetic field’s asymmetry is increasing. The entire reversal is expected
to take several thousand years.
In 1915, German geophysicist Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) proposed the idea that conti-
nents move (“continental drift”) across Earth’s surface based on recognition of similar geog-
raphy, rock types, fossils, and geologic structures along the west coast of Africa and the east
coast of South America. However, no driving mechanism for continental drift was identified
and the theory languished. In the 1960s, geophysicists recognized that the mirror-image pat-
tern of polarity reversals recorded in basaltic rocks on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean indicated
that ocean floors were also moving, a process called sea-floor spreading (McElhinny 1979).
The theories of continental drift and sea-floor spreading were combined into the concept of
plate tectonics, which states that the entire outermost portion of Earth is moving (see papers in
Cox 1973).
Much of Earth’s volcanic and tectonic activity results from plate tectonics, driven by the
planet’s internal heat. Earth’s lithosphere is segmented into seven major and dozens of minor
plates which move relative to each other because of convection occurring within the astheno-
sphere. Most of Earth’s volcanic and tectonic activity occurs along plate boundaries. New crust
is formed and plates move apart from each other at divergent boundaries (> Fig. 3-5), char-
acterized by extensional faulting, shallow earthquakes, and fluid volcanism. Plates converge at
two types of convergent boundaries. A collision convergent boundary results in two plates, each
composed ofthick continental crust, crumpling toform a mountain range (>Fig. 3-6). Collision
convergent boundaries are characterized by earthquakes but no volcanic activity. Alternately,
one ocean crust plate can descend beneath another plate (consisting of either ocean crust or
continental crust) at a subduction convergent boundary, characterized by deep earthquakes
and explosive volcanism (> Fig. 3-7). Two plates slide past each other (strike-slip faulting) at
transform boundaries, resulting in earthquakes (>Fig. 3-8).
Although most of Earth’s volcanic and tectonic activity occurs along plate boundaries, some
earthquakes and volcanoes occur within the plates. Intraplate volcanism, such as Hawaii, results
from mantle plumes (“hot spots”) which ascend directly to the surface without being incorpo-
rated into the convection cells driving plate tectonics. Intraplate earthquakes, such as the series
of earthquakes (magnitudes 7.2–8.1) that occurred in New Madrid, Missouri, in 1811–1812,
are believed to result from redistribution of unreleased stress from the plate boundaries into
the interior of the plate.
Earth displays a wide variety of volcanic landforms, ranging from flat lava flows to steep-
sided volcanoes. The type ofvolcaniclandform produced during a volcaniceruption depends on
viscosity (“stickiness”) of the erupting magma and the eruption rate. Viscosity depends on the
magma’s temperature (higher temperature corresponds to more fluid magmas) and the amount
of silica (SiO) in the magma (higher SiOcorresponds to stickier (higher viscosity) magmas).

Red Sea. A divergent boundary runs up the Red Sea (bottom) into the Gulf of Suez (left), splitting
Sinai from Egypt (lower left). The Gulf of Aqaba (right) is formed by a slippage along a transform
fault (NASA/Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI))
High eruption rates and low viscosity magmas produce flat plains of lava flows called flood
basalts, which are very common throughout the solar system. Low eruption rates and low-
viscosity magmas produce large, low-sloped (typically <3○) volcanic constructs called shield
volcanoes (>Fig. 3-9), which have been observed on Mercury, Venus, and Mars in addition to
Earth. Removal of magma during the eruption results in a collapsed depression, called a caldera,
at the top of the shield volcano. Gases become trapped by the SiOlattice in higher viscosity
gases, resulting in magma fragmentation when the gas is finally able to escape. This fragmented
material cools to form cinders and the resulting structures are called cinder cones (>Fig. 3-10).
Higher viscosity magmasproduce steep-sidedcomposite or stratovolcanoes (>Fig. 3-11) which
consist of layers of fine-grained ash alternating with lava flows. Composite volcanoes are very
explosive because of the high concentration of gas trapped in the SiO-rich magma. Composite
volcanoes occur in convergent subduction zones on Earth and have thus far not been identified
conclusively on any other solar system body.

Mass wasting is the downward movement of material resulting from Earth’s gravity. Mass
wasting processes varyin theirspeed, from veryslow deformation ofweak (often ice-rich)mate-
rial called creep to rapid movements of slopes, such as landslides and mudslides (>Fig. 3-12).
The angle of repose is the transition angle between stable soils and sliding materials. Angle of
repose depends on the size of the soil particles, with higher angles possible for irregular parti-
cles than for fine-grained material. A slope which exceeds the angle of repose for the material is
oversteepened and the material will easily slide. Seismic activity can induce slope failure when
the slope is close to the angle of repose, and the presence of ice and/or liquid helps lubricate
soils so that slope failure can occur even when dry material was stable.
Earth’s atmosphere also contributes to its surface geology. The 1 bar atmospheric pressure at
Earth’s surface combined with warm surface temperatures allow HO to exist as gas in the atmo-
sphere (water vapor) and as liquid (water) and solid (ice) on the surface. Liquid water, found in
oceans, lakes, and rivers, creates fluvial landforms as it travels from higher to lower elevations.

River channels are commonly dendritic on Earth, where smaller creeks and streams combine to
form larger rivers (>Fig. 3-13). Most terrestrial channels originate from rainfall or snowmelt,
although sapping channels form by collapse following removal of groundwater. Catastrophic
floods create much larger channels, such as the Channeled Scablands (> Fig. 3-14) of eastern
Washington which formed between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago following episodic collapses of
an ice dam which formed Lake Missoula across western Montana (Baker and Nummedal 1978).
Fluvial activity forms other unique landforms. An alluvial fan forms when a sediment-
carrying stream encounters a sudden drop, such as occurs along the edge of a cliff or mountain
range. Water and sediments spread out at the base of the cliff, forming the triangular-shaped
alluvial fan (>Fig. 3-15). Deltas are produced when a sediment-laden river encounters a larger
body of water, such as a lake or ocean (>Fig. 3-16). The river drops its sediment load because
its water velocity decreases as it enters the larger standing body of water. The influence of liquid
water can be inferred even after the water has evaporated. Dry river beds are obvious places
where water once flowed, but dry lake beds (playas; > Fig. 3-17) and shoreline terraces also
reveal the prior influence of liquid water on a landscape.
The temperature range on Earth also allows for the existence of water ice. Glaciers are
large sheets of ice which build up over many years when summer temperatures are insufficient
to melt all the snow which precipitates during winter. Glaciers can be stationary (cold-based
glaciers) or can slide on liquid produced at their base (warm-based glaciers). Alpine glaciers
(> Fig. 3-18) are small, localized ice sheets which originate in mountainous environments
and, if warm-based, can move downslope under the influence of gravity, carving out U-
shaped valleys. Continental glaciers are large, flat ice sheets covering large portions of a surface
(>Fig. 3-19). Continental glaciers were common during the five major ice ages experienced by

periods of glacial advance interspersed with warmer interglacial periods. The only continental
glaciers remaining during the present interglacial period are ice sheets covering Greenland and

Changes in Earth’s orbital eccentricity, precession, and axial tilt (obliquity) affect the planet’s
climate and may contribute to ice age occurrence (Hays et al. 1976; Imbrie and Imbrie 1980;
Muller and MacDonald 1997). These cycles are called Milankovitch cycles after Serbian math-
ematician Milutin Milankovi´c (1879–1958) who proposed that gravitational perturbations by
other planets could affect Earth’s orbit and obliquity. Earth completes one entire cycle of pre-
cession about every 26,000 years. Gravitational perturbations from the other planets (mainly
Jupiter and Saturn) cause Earth’s orbital eccentricity to vary between 0.005 and 0.058 (current
value is 0.017) over a period of ∼100,000 years. These same gravitational perturbations cause
the tilt of Earth’s rotation axis to vary from 22.1○to 24.5○(current obliquity is 23.5○) over a

41,000 year period, cause the perihelion (minimum Earth–Sun distance) position to change on
a 23,000 year cycle, and produce a 100,000 year cycle in orbital inclination. Depending on how
these different cycles align, they can enhance or reduce climatic effects. Milankovitch cycles are
a good but not exact match to the timing of past terrestrial ice ages, indicating that although
they are a major contributor, other processes also influence the occurrence of glacial periods
on Earth.
Earth’s atmosphere moves in response to differences in temperature and pressure, produc-
ing wind. Wind, like water, can transport small particles from one location to another. Aeolian
features are geologic landforms resulting from the erosional or depositional action of wind.
Ventifacts are rocks sandblasted into triangular shapes by small particles carried by the wind.
Yardangs are elongated ridges of rock, produced when surrounding soft rock is eroded away by
wind coming from a prevailing direction (> Fig. 3-20). Depositional aeolian features include
thick, unsorted deposits of small dust grains called loess and a variety of sand dune shapes
(>Fig. 3-21). Wind streaks also are common aeolian features and can be either bright or dark.
Bright wind streaks are dust deposits in the lee of a topographic obstacle which form when
bright, fine-grained dust is removed from the surrounding area by wind. Dark wind streaks

Volcanism, earthquakes, mass wasting, fluvial activity, glaciers, and aeolian processes are
readily observable on Earth’s surface. Impact cratering, however, is a very rare process whose
influence on Earth’s geology was debated until the mid-twentieth century. Scientists did not
accept that rocks fell from space until the early 1800s, and even after the extraterrestrial origin
of meteorites was accepted, scientists did not recognize the amount of energy associated with
impacts of larger meteorites. Few recognizable impact craters exist on Earth’s surface because
of our planet’s active erosional environment, and the obvious circular depressions on the Moon
(first called craters by Galileo in 1610) were interpreted to be volcanic calderas based on ter-
restrial experience. The circular appearance of lunar craters was used as an argument against
an impact origin since everyday experience shows that rocks tossed into a sandbox will pro-
duce elongated craters unless the rock is dropped from a vertical angle. Nobody at the time
recognized that bolides large enough to produce impact craters are traveling at velocities on
the order of tens of kilometer per second (hypervelocities), which are considerably faster than
velocities obtained by tossing a rock into a sandbox.

Laboratory experiments of hypervelocity impacts during the 1920s and 1930s revealed that
such impacts are explosion events, destroying the projectile and sending out shock waves in the
surface (target) material that excavate a circular crater unless the impact angle is very shallow
(<10–15○). The physics of impact crater formation was developed during the 1940s and 1950s
by studies of nuclear and large chemical explosion craters (see papers in Roddy et al. 1977).
Those studies revealed that it is a combination of downward-propagating compressional shock
waves and upward-propagating tensional rarefaction waves which excavate an approximately
circular crater that is about ten times larger than the original projectile. Impact crater formation
occurs in three stages (Melosh 1989): contact/compression, excavation, and modification. The
contact/compression stage occurs when the projectile encounters the target and transfers its
energy to the surface material. This first stage lasts only a few seconds and ends with projectile
destruction. The crater cavity is produced during the excavation stage, when the shock and
rarefaction waves combine to excavate the transient cavity. The excavation stage ends when
the transient cavity reaches its maximum size, which takes only a few minutes for even the
largest craters. The final stage of crater formation is the modification stage. Initial stages of
the modification stage produce central peaks and wall collapse and last only a few minutes.
All subsequent processes affecting the crater are included in the modification stage, including
erosion, deposition, isostatic uplift, and tectonic modification. Hence, the modification stage
continues until the crater is completely destroyed.
Hypervelocityexperiments and explosion craterstudies provided the theoretical framework
for impact crater formation, but no terrestrial impact craters had yet been confirmed by the
1950s. One feature which had been proposed to be of impact origin was a 1.2-km-diameter
depression with a raised rim in northern Arizona called Coon Mountain (Hoyt 1987)
(>Fig. 3-23). Small pieces of iron scattered around Coon Mountain had led some to propose it

was an impact crater formed by destruction of an iron meteorite. However, the famous geolo-
gist G. K. Gilbert visited Coon Mountain in 1891 and decided it must be a volcanic landform
(formed by a steam explosion as magma encountered groundwater) since he was unable to
detect any evidence of a huge chunk of iron meteorite which he expected to be buried under
the crater floor. Although Gilbert’s reputation convinced most people that Coon Mountain was
not an impact crater, mining engineer Daniel M. Barringer disagreed and bought Coon Moun-
tain in 1903. Barringer set up a mining operation on the depression’s floor in an attempt to
excavate the intact iron-nickel meteorite that he believed was buried under the floor. Barringer
was so convinced of Coon Mountain’s extraterrestrial origin that he founded the small town
Meteor City along nearby Route 66 so he could rename the depression Meteor Crater (impact
craters are named after the closest town with a post office). Barringer’s mining operations on
both the floor and under the crater’s south rim only recovered small pieces of iron meteorite
and the operation went bankrupt. Scientists were only beginning to realize that impact craters
form by explosion events and the projectile explodes during crater formation rather than lying
intact at the bottom of the crater.
Barringer’s efforts to convince people of the impact origin of Meteor Cratermet with limited
success since most people were still swayed by Gilbert’s volcanic interpretation of the landform.
A young geologist named Eugene Shoemaker finally confirmed the impact origin of Meteor
Crater through his pioneering studies of the crater’s geology (Shoemaker 1963). Shoemaker
noted that Meteor Crater displayed numerous differences from volcanic calderas, including the
lack of volcanic materials, location on flat ground rather than an elevated mountain, presence
of iron meteorite fragments in and around the crater, and inverted stratigraphy in the raised
rim (where geologically older layers overlie younger layers; > Fig. 3-24). The clincher for an
impact origin of Meteor Crater came from the discovery of coesite and stishovite, which are
high-pressure phases of quartz (Chao et al. 1960). Stishovite forms when shock pressures reach

12–15 GPa and coesite occurs when pressures exceed 30 GPa. Such high pressures, particularly
for coesite, can only occur in impact events.
Recognition ofhigh-pressure mineral phases as well as microscopicand macroscopicshock-
metamorphic features (French 1998) has led to the detection of over 200 impact craters on Earth
(> Fig. 3-25). Meteor Crater formed 50,000 years ago, making it one of the youngest and best
preserved impact craters on Earth. It is an example of a small, bowl-shaped crater called a simple
crater. Complex craters are larger and show more complicated morphologies, including shal-
lower depth-to-diameter ratios, presence of central peaks, and collapse of oversteepened walls
to produce wall terraces. The transition from simple to complex craters depends on the strength
of the target material and inversely scales with the planet’s gravity. The simple-to-complex tran-
sition diameter on Earth occurs around 2 km for impacts into sedimentary rocks and 4 km for
crystalline rocks like basalt. Most terrestrial impact craters are heavily eroded and their origi-
nal interior structures and ejecta blankets are missing or highly modified. Observations of the
heavily cratered surfaces of the Moon, Mercury, and Mars indicate that Earth has hosted many
more impact craters than the 200 currently identified. Most of these craters have been destroyed
by Earth’s active geologic processes, and the LHB record has been erased since no intact sur-
faces survive from this early time period. Perusal of > Fig. 3-25 shows that most identified
impact craters occur on old, stable continental platforms, such as those found in Canada, north-
ern Eurasia, and Australia. Tectonically active regions such as plate boundaries and the young
(<200 Ma) ocean floors are statistically unlikely to display impact scars since the cratering rate
over the past 3.8 Ga has been ∼100–500 times lower than it was during the LHB.
Earth’s restless nature often results in geologic disasters for its life forms. Landslides and
mudslides routinely destroy homes built in scenic mountainous regions. Floods can affect any-
one on Earth regardless of location. Building collapse triggered by earthquakes kills many
people, such as the 73,000 people who died in the 7.6-mag earthquake in Kashmir in 2005.
Tsunamis triggered by large earthquakes devastate coastal areas and are accompanied by large

death tolls, such as the 2004 tsunami which killed over 200,000 people in Southeast Asia (trig-
gered by a ∼9.2 mag earthquake off the coast of Indonesia). Tsunamis also can be generated by
large explosive volcanic eruptions, particularly when these volcanoes blow themselves apart,
as happened in 1883 with Krakatoa in Indonesia. The ∼1500 BC collapse of Thera volcano
created the doughnut shape of the Greek island Santorini and destroyed the Minoan civiliza-
tion. Supervolcanoes affect even larger areas – three eruptions of the Yellowstone supervolcano
between 2.1 Ma and 640,000 years ago spread ash over most of the continental USA west of
the Mississippi River. But these geologic disasters pale in comparison to the amount of energy
released during large impact events (French 1998). Formation of 1.2-km-diameter Meteor
Crater released ∼.× J of energy, comparable to the energy released in the 1980 explo-
sive eruption of Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington. A 10-km-diameter impact crater
releases .× J of energy, more than the 1883 Krakatoa eruption (.× J) or the largest
recorded earthquake (magnitude 9.6 in Chile in 1960, which released .× J of energy).
Formation of the largest impact craters, such as 2-Ga-old, ∼250-km-diameter Vredefort Basin
in South Africa, releases almost 300 times more energy than Earth’s total annual energy output
from heat flow, earthquakes, and volcanism combined.
Consequences of large impacts on terrestrial life were not fully appreciated until 1980 when
Luis and Walter Alvarez began investigating possible causes for a layer of iridium found in sed-
iments deposited 65 Ma ago at the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (KT
Boundary) (Alvarez et al. 1980). Paleontologists had known for some time that a large number
of species, including the dinosaurs, had died out around 65 Ma. The proposed causes of this
mass extinction ranged from climate change caused by breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea
to radiation from a nearby supernova explosion. Discovery of high iridium concentrations in
sediments from this period suggested that the KT mass extinction resulted from the collision
of a large asteroid with Earth. Iridium is a siderophile element and is therefore concentrated in
Earth’s core. Asteroids are small enough that most never underwent differentiation, therefore
iridium remains dispersed through the asteroid. Further research revealed that KT sediments
across the entire globe showed enhancement of iridium and other impact signatures, such as
shocked quartz and impact spherules (Bohor et al. 1987). The impact not only distributed pro-
jectile and target debris across the globe but also induced wildfires which injected soot into
Earth’s stratosphere. This soot was carried by stratospheric winds around the globe, reducing
the amount of sunlight reaching the surface and cooling the entire planet. Plants began to die
from reduced sunlight levels, leading to a massive die-off of herbivores. Carnivorous animals
subsequently starved from the lack of herbivores and the entire food chain collapsed, resulting
in the observed mass extinction.
An asteroid about 10 km in diameter would be necessary to produce the observed global
effects. An asteroid of this size should produce an impact crater between 100 and 200 km in
diameter. No known impact crater was of the correct size and age, leading geologists to begin
searching for a buried impact structure to confirm the Alvarez et al. hypothesis. KT sediment
layers rich in iridium and other impact debris were thickest in the Americas and thus geol-
ogists concentrated their search in the western hemisphere. Tsunami deposits of the correct
age were found through central Texas and along the southeastern US coast, suggesting the
impact occurred at least partially in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Mexican oil com-
pany PEMEX discovered thick sequences of brecciated (fragmented) rocks in their drill cores
from the continental shelf off the northern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, which geologists
recognized as a signature of an impact. Further inspection revealed that sinkholes (cenotes) in
northern Yucatan displayed an arcuate pattern and outlined the edge of a ∼175-km-diameter

impact crater (>Fig. 3-26), subsequently dated at 65 Ma. The crater, named Chicxulub after the
town closest to its center, is now widely accepted as the scar of the impact which initiated the
KT mass extinction (Hildebrand et al. 1991; Sharpton et al. 1992). Several other mass extinc-
tion events in Earth’s history have subsequently been linked to large impact events, revealing
that the evolutionary path followed by terrestrial lifeforms has been altered many times by col-
lisions with asteroids and comets. Recognition that impacts have influenced the evolution of
life on Earth has led to development of the “impact frustration theory,” which states that life
forms began and were destroyed by impact events many times during the LHB period (Maher
and Stevenson 1988). Widespread distribution of life on Earth did not occur until after the high
impact rates of the LHB had declined.

Venus
Venus is Earth’s twin in terms of physical properties. Venus’ equatorial diameter of 12,104 km
is 95% of Earth’s equatorial diameter (12,756), making Venus the planet closest in size to Earth.
Venus’ mass (.×kg) is 82% of Earth’s mass (.×kg), meaning the densities of the
two worlds are similar (5,200 kg m−for Venus versus 5,500 kg m−for Earth). The similar den-
sities indicate that the two planets are composed of similar materials, with crusts and mantles
consisting of silicate minerals and cores made primarily of iron. Gravity analysis indicates that
C/MRfor Venus is 0.33, identical to the value for Earth, suggesting that Venus has a core about
the same size as that of Earth. Lack of seismic data for Venus precludes detailed information
about the interior structure, but modeling based on gravity data, the planet’s mean density, and
scaling from Earth’s interior structure suggest a core radius of ∼2,900 km, a ∼3,100-km-thick
mantle, and a crust that is <50 km thick (Grimm and Hess 1997).
Venus and Earth, however, are fraternal twins rather than identical. Although Venus is 95%
the size ofthe Earth, it is just small enough that pressures are insufficient toproduce a solid inner
core. No active magnetic field has been detected around Venus, indicating that the liquid iron
core is not convecting sufficiently rapidly to produce a dynamo. This may be at least partially
due to Venus’ very slow rotation rate of 243 Earth days. Not only is Venus the slowest rotating
planet in the solar system, its rotation direction is backwards (retrograde) compared to Earth
and most other planets. Most planets rotate in a counterclockwise direction as seen from above
the ecliptic plane (direction above Earth’s north pole), but Venus’s rotation is clockwise from this
vantage point. The most likely explanation for Venus’ slow retrograde rotation is that it suffered
a collision with a large asteroid or comet traveling on a retrograde orbit early in the planet’s
history. The result is an obliquity value of 177○for Venus’ north pole (defined as the pole above
which the planet is seen to rotate in a counterclockwise direction). The small 3○tilt of Venus’
rotation axis from the normal to its orbital plane means that Venus essentially experiences no
seasons.
Early telescopic observations revealed no sign of surface features on Venus, leading
astronomers to correctly infer that the planet is shrouded by an opaque cloud layer contained
within a planetary atmosphere (> Fig. 3-27). Venus’ thick atmosphere is composed of carbon
dioxide (CO) which exerts a pressure of 95 bars at the planet’s surface (compared to Earth’s 1
bar surface pressure). The opaque cloud layer lies between 40 and 60 km above the surface and
is composed of sulfuric acid droplets. Visible-wavelength sunlight reaching the planet’s sur-
face is absorbed by surface rocks and reemitted at longer thermal infrared (heat) wavelengths.
Atmospheric COis opaque to thermal infrared, thereby trapping this heat next to the surface.
This process is called greenhouse warming and has resulted in a 740 K surface temperature for
Venus. This temperature is fairly stable across the entire planet, varying by no more than 30○
between daytime and nighttime sides in spite of the planet’s slow rotation.
Although the cloud layer precludes optical wavelength observations of Venus’ surface,
longer wavelength radar can penetrate the clouds and provide insights into surface topography
and geology. The first radar observations of Venus were made in the 1960s using Earth-
based radio telescopes and provided information about the planet’s large-scale topography
(> Fig. 3-28). Those radar images revealed that most of Venus’ surface consists of flat plains
with elevations generally within 2 km of the planet’s mean radius (“reference radius”). Three
elevated continent-like regions exist, two in the equatorial region (Aphrodite Terra and Beta
Region) and one at high northern latitudes (Ishtar Terra). Aphrodite Terra is about the size of
Africa and has an elevation about 5 km above the reference radius. Ishtar Terra is about the

size of Australia and contains a high mountain range (Maxwell Montes) which extends up to
11 km above the reference radius. Beta Regio is much smaller than either Aphrodite or Ishtar
and consists of the Theia Mons volcano and a tectonically deformed feature called Rhea Mons.
Higher resolution views of Venus’ surface geology were obtained through radar observa-
tions from orbiting missions. Four radar-carrying spacecraft have orbited Venus: the Russian
Venera 15 and 16 missions in 1983–1984, and the US Pioneer Venus (1978–1992) and Magellan
(1990–1994) spacecraft. Pioneer Venus mapped about 90% of Venus’ surface at a horizontal res-
olution of 30 km and vertical resolution of 700 m. It provided scientists with their first detailed
views of the planet’s surface (Hunten et al. 1983). Venera 15 and 16 improved the areal resolu-
tion to 1–2 km and vertical resolution to 30 m, but only mapped 25% of the surface. The most
detailed radar mapping to date was obtained by Magellan, which imaged 98% of the surface at
horizontal resolutions up to 100 m during the mapping phase from 1990 to 1992 (Bougher et al.
1997). Its synthetic aperture radar had a vertical resolution of 30 m. Later mission cycles were
devoted to obtaining high-resolution gravity data, which showed that topographic features on
Venus are typically supported by both variations in crustal thickness and mantle plumes.
Soviet/Russian and American probes directly investigated Venus’ atmosphere, and a few of
these probes were designed to land on the surface. Veneras 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 and the Vega
1 and 2 landers provided basic analysis of surface soil and rocks at landing sites within the
±30○latitude zone (> Fig. 3-29). The Venera missions all landed on or east-southeast of Beta
Regio whereas the two Vega missions landed along the edge of eastern Aphrodite Terra. Anal-
yses, consisting of gamma ray spectrometry and/or x-ray fluorescence, revealed that Venera 8
and 13 samples were composed of high-potassium (alkaline) basalts whereas the other landing

Locations of Impact Craters
⊡Fig. 3-30
Venus Crater Distribution. Impact craters on Venus show a random distribution, suggesting a
global resurfacing event occurred about 0.5 Ga ago (LPI)
site samples consisted of normal (lime-alkaline) to low (tholeiitic) potassium basalts (Barsukov
1992). These compositions are similar to the range of basalts found on Earth, which are pro-
duced by melting in the mantle. However, no landers have yet sampled soils or rocks from the
interiors of the highlands regions on Venus, so scientists cannot definitively rule out existence
of non-basaltic materials on the planet.
Analysis of radar imagery has revealed about 900 impact craters distributed in an approx-
imately random pattern across Venus’ surface – there are no regions of extremely high or
extremely low crater density (> Fig. 3-30). This distribution suggests that all surface units on
Venus are about the same age, estimated at ∼0.5 Ga based on crater density (Phillips et al. 1992;
Schaber et al. 1992). Thus, although Venus formed with the rest of the solar system planets about
4.5 Ga, some event occurred around ∼0.5 Ga ago which completely resurfaced the planet. No
surface units from before this time survived and thus the planet’s earlier geologic history is lost.
The cause of this massive resurfacing event is not completely understood, but interior mod-
els suggest that Venus oscillates between quiescent and active volcanic periods on a timescale
of a few hundred million years because of chemical differentiation occurring in the interior.
Crustal overturn occurs by vertical resurfacing, where volcanism and tectonism allow under-
lying magma to erupt onto the surface (Grimm and Hess 1997). Following complete crustal
overturn, the planet enters a quiescent period where volcanism and tectonism are regionally
limited and erosion rates are low.Craters randomly form on the planet’s surface and undergo lit-
tle modification until the next catastrophic resurfacing episode occurs. This model is consistent
with the well-preserved nature of most impact craters on Venus.

Small impact craters typically outnumber larger craters since small asteroids and comets are
more common than larger ones. However, Venus displays a distinct lack of small impact craters.
Craters smaller than ∼3-km-diameter are completely missing and craters between 3 and 15-
km-diameter tend to exist as overlapping crater clusters instead of a single crater (>Fig. 3-31)
(Phillips et al. 1992). Both of these observations can be attributed to Venus’ thick atmosphere.
The smallest projectiles vaporize during passage through the atmosphere and slightly larger
materials are fragmented, resulting in almost simultaneous impacts of several pieces of the pro-
jectile. Only larger projectiles can survive the pressure and friction of their atmospheric passage
and strike the ground intact.
Venus’ atmosphere affects its impact craters in additional ways (>Fig. 3-32, Schultz 1992).
Lobate ejecta flows extend from fresh impact craters and were produced by interaction of the
curtain of ejected debris with turbulent atmospheric eddies. Winds induced by motion of the
ejecta curtain drive a ground-hugging debris flow which extends many crater radii beyond the
crater rim. Extensive run-out flows beyond the normal ejecta blanket may result either from
debris flows of vaporized material early in the crater formation process or large amounts of
impact melt (Asimow and Wood 1992; Schultz 1992). Asymmetric ejecta blankets, indicative of
oblique impact events, are enhanced through interactions ofthe ejecta curtain with atmospheric
turbulence. Many impact craters also display radar-bright or radar-dark halos, resulting from
scouring and debris deposition by atmospheric blast waves produced as the projectile passes
through the atmosphere. Radar-dark parabolas surround some impact craters on Venus and
probably result from late-stage fallout of material entrained in the atmosphere.
The high surface temperature precludes the existence of liquid water or ice on present-day
Venus, and Magellan’s radar images show no evidence that water or ice have affected Venus’

Stein Crater Field, Venus. Small meteorites often fragment as they pass through the thick Venu-
sian atmosphere, resulting in crater clusters rather than a single impact crater once they impact

surface geology within the last 0.5 Ga of recorded history. Venus’ atmosphere also shows lit-
tle evidence of water vapor, indicating the entire planet is currently quite dry. But Venus may
have been wetter in the distant past. Venus may have outgassed a water vapor atmosphere early
in its history, which caused its surface temperature to increase due to greenhouse warming.
Increasing surface temperature resulted in more water vapor accumulating in the atmosphere,
which led to a runaway greenhouse effect. Eventually all of the planet’s water accumulated in
the atmosphere. Atmospheric mixing gradually brought the water molecules to the upper part
of the atmosphere where they could be photodissociated by solar ultraviolet radiation, allowing
hydrogen atoms to escape to space. Oxygen would combine with carbon atoms to form the CO
atmosphere seen today. Alternatively, the moist Greenhouse model proposes that Venus’ sur-
face temperature was initially cool enough for a liquid water ocean on the planet’s surface. Air
above the ocean was saturated with water vapor and convection transported this water vapor
to the top of the atmosphere where water molecules were photodissociated. Atmospheric water
vapor produced Greenhouse warming near the surface, but the higher temperature resulted in
increasing rates of evaporation from the ocean, leading to more water vapor in the atmosphere
and high enough atmospheric pressure to keep the ocean from boiling away. Molecular oxy-
gen (O) and COwere removed from the atmosphere through interactions with ocean water,
resulting in production of carbonate minerals. Water continued to evaporate from the ocean as
photodissociation removed water vapor from the top of the atmosphere. Eventually all liquid
water was removed from the surface through evaporation, and atmospheric convection led to

Terrestrial Planets 3
143
removal of water vapor through photodissociation. CObegan to accumulate in the atmosphere
since lack of liquid water on the surface kept it from being removed through formation of car-
bonates. The planet’s sulfuric acid clouds may have resulted from volcanism associated with the
crustal overturn 0.5 Ga (Bullock and Grinspoon 2001) and are likely maintained through recent
regional volcanism.
More than 6,000 aeolian landforms have been detected in Magellan images ofVenus’ surface.
Most of these are wind streaks, produced by interaction of prevailing winds with topographic
obstacles. Depositional landforms such as dune fields (> Fig. 3-33) and erosional features
including yardangs have been identified. Orientation of wind streaks, dune fields, and yardangs
have been used to determine near-surface wind directions, which are found to be consistent
with those predicted by Hadley Cell circulation produced from solar heating (Greeley et al.
1997).
Mass wasting features resulting from Venus’ gravity are observed. Complex craters on Venus
show evidence of the downward pull of gravity through the presence of wall terraces. Landslides
are seen in association with mountainous regions on the planet (>Fig. 3-34).
The most prevalent geologic landforms on Venus are volcanic and tectonic features. Vol-
canism primarily consists of low-viscosity lavas, as indicated by widespread presence of flood
basalts and shield volcanoes (>Fig. 3-35) and Venera/Vega lander detection of basalt. Volcanic
features are divided into large individual volcanic centers consisting of edifices and calderas
produced by high eruption rates, intermediate volcanoes, and fields of small shield volcanoes
formed by lower eruption rates (Crumpler et al. 1997; Guest et al. 1992; Head et al. 1992).
Slightly more than half of all volcanoes on Venus are found in the Beta-Atla-Themis region.
The low-viscosity nature of Venus’ lava also is indicated by the presence of more than 200 lava
channels (Baker et al. 1997). Some channels are morphologically similar to sinuous rilles seen
on other solar system bodies and typically originate from collapse regions. Extremely long chan-
nels, called canali, displayconstant width along theirentire length (>500 km)and are commonly

Landslides, Venus. ThisMagellan imageshows landslides on the northeast and northwest slopes of
a 17.4-km-diameter volcano on Venus. These landslides formed when the volcano ﬂanks collapsed
under the planet’s gravitational inﬂuence (NASA/JPL)
found on the Venusian plains (> Fig. 3-36). Morphologic characteristics of the canali indi-
cate they form by a highly erosive fluid, such as high iron-titanium basalts, komatiites, alkali
carbonatite, or sulfur lavas (Kargel et al. 1994; Williams-Jones et al. 1998).
Intermediate volcanoes are 20 to 100 km in diameter and display features such as radial
lava flows, fracture patterns, and/or a volcanic edifice (Head et al. 1992). Intermediate volca-
noes include the anemone and tick subclasses. Anemones have a petal-like lava flow pattern
surrounding a central elongated caldera. Ticks have a circular flat or depressed interior sur-
rounded by a rim and display a series of ridges radiating outward from the rim. Several different
models for tick formation have been proposed, including extrusion and rifting, localized dike
intrusion, erosion of ash flows, or post-volcanism slumping.
Although most volcanic features on Venus form from fluid magmas, some examples of high-
viscosity lavas are observed. Pancake domes (> Fig. 3-37) are steep-sided, flat-topped edifices
which show morphologic similarities to high-viscosity silicic lava domes on Earth (Pavri et al.
1992). Head et al. (1992) classify them in the intermediate volcano category. The higher viscos-
ity lavas forming pancake domes likely originate from differentiation and evolution of basaltic
magmas within subsurface magma chambers.
Large volcanoes include coronae, arachnoids, and novae. Coronae are large (>200 km diam-
eter) circular volcanic-tectonic structures common on Venus but with no terrestrial analogs
(> Fig. 3-38). Coronae are slightly elevated regions (∼1–1.5 km high) bounded by concentric
fractures. Volcanic features such as calderas, domes, and lava flows are common in their interi-
ors, which also display radial fractures. The entire feature is surrounded by a topographic moat
(Stofan et al. 1997). Coronae tend to occur as rises within the plains and along large exten-
sional tectonic features called chasmata.They form by upwelling plateau-shapedmantle diapirs,

Aine Corona, Venus. Coronae are large volcanic features bordered by circumferential graben. This
Magellan image shows 200-km-diameter Aine Corona and its associated volcanic and tectonic
features (NASA/JPL)
which fracture the surface and produce the associated volcanic landforms. Following the erup-
tion, the diapir cools and loses its buoyancy which causes the corona region to relax, producing
additional fractures and the surrounding moat.
Arachnoids display a concentric pattern of fractures or ridges surrounded by extensive
radial fractures or ridges. Their name is derived from their resemblance to a multilegged spi-
der. Arachnoids are smaller than coronae, with diameters <200 km. They display fewer signs of

Terrestrial Planets 3

extrusive flows than coronae but otherwise are morphologically similar to their larger counter-
parts and therefore likely share a similar origin. Magmatism associated with arachnoids may
be largely intrusive (underground), explaining the lack of obvious flow structures, whereas that
for coronae is predominantly extrusive (aboveground).
Unlike coronae and arachnoids, novae display no concentric structures, appearing as out-
ward radiating fractures similar to a starburst. The fracture pattern often is centered on a broad
elevated dome and fractures narrow in width as they extend outward from the center. Novae
typically occur in association with other large volcanic features and often are found in the inte-
riors of coronae and arachnoids. Their characteristics suggest that novae form in response to
uplift and fracturing of the surface by underlying magma intrusions (Head et al. 1992).
Both extensional and compressional tectonic features are observed in Magellan data and
much of the tectonic activity is associated with volcanic landforms (Solomon et al. 1992). The
most intensely fractured regions are tessera terrain (> Fig. 3-39), which are elevated above
the surrounding plains and characterized by at least two intersecting sets of tectonic features
(Hansen et al. 1997). Tessera were first detected in Venera 15 and 16 radar images and have been
subdivided into different classes based on morphology (folds, extensional fractures and graben,
compressional ridges, etc.). Tessera are among the oldest surface units on Venus, although not
all tessera units were formed simultaneously. The variety of landforms within tessera units
indicates a complex tectonic history and variations in stress regimes in different portions of
the crust.
Extensional fractures are common across Venus’ surface, typically forming flat-floored
valleys called graben (> Fig. 3-40). Long linear graben are commonly associated with large
volcanoes and may represent underlying dike swarms. Several large extensional rift zones (chas-
mata) exist on Venus, including Devana Chasma in Beta Regio and Ganis Chasma in the Atla
Regio region of western Aphrodite Terra, both of which are associated with large volcanic fea-
tures. A different type of extensional faulting is observed in central Aphrodite Terra with the
west-southwest to east-northeast trending Diana Chasma and east-west trending Dali Chasma.
These chasmata have been variously interpreted as a fold-and-thrust belt, a transform zone, a

crustal spreading zone, and even an area of lithospheric subduction (Solomon et al. 1992). The
prevalence of extensional fractures across the planet indicates that a considerable amount of
lithospheric stretching occurs on Venus.
Ishtar Terra displays evidence of both extensional and compressional tectonics (Hansen
et al. 1997; Solomon et al. 1992). Ishtar rises more than 2 km above the planetary reference
radius and is composed of a variety of landforms (>Fig. 3-41). Most of Ishtar Terra is dominated
by Lakshmi Planum, a broad plateau (4 km above reference) bordered by mountain belts (Danu,
Akna, Freyja, and Maxwell Montes, extending from 3.5–11 km in elevation) and steep smooth
scarps on the north and south sides. Tessera terrains extend beyond the mountain belts whereas
the scarps descend to plains-filled basins. The surface of Lakshmi Planum is characterized by
wrinkle ridges formed in response to compressional stresses in lava flows, smooth plains formed
by lava flows, and marginal troughs formed by extension. The center of Lakshmi is dominated
by volcanic calderas, including 100-km-diameter Colette and 200-km-diameter Sacajewea. The
four mountain belts surrounding Lakshmi Planum are compressional folds and thrust faults
which formed by crustal shortening of the surrounding plains after Lakshmi formed. Some
modification of the mountain belts by volcanism and extension are seen on the non-Lakshmi
sides. The range of landforms indicates that Ishtar Terra has experienced a complex history
which cannot be described by simple mantle upwelling or downwelling (Hansen et al. 1997).
Magellan gravity data suggest that Ishtar Terra formed in an area of mantle downwelling, which

elevation on Venus (Maxwell Montes) and the complexity of terrains indicates a unique evolution

resulted in the ponding and thickening of a residuum layer formed by partial melting of the
mantle. Lakshmi Planum formed in this region, overlying normal plains crust. Shear displace-
ment of the lower part of the crust (which was decoupled from the upper crust) toward the
center of Lakshmi produced the marginal mountain belts and their associated tessera.
The variety of volcanic and tectonic features on Venus suggests a different mechanism for
removal of interior heat than the plate tectonics regime operating on Earth (Hansen et al. 1997;
Solomon et al. 1992). Venus’ lithosphere undergoes predominantly vertical motions but the
lithosphere itself remains fixed in position, in contrast to the horizontal movement of Earth’s
tectonic plates. Convection within Venus’ asthenosphere produces zones of mantle upwelling
(producing extensional faulting, coronae, and chasmata) and downwelling (resulting in plains
and compressional ridge belts), and these convection cells migrate with time. Deep thermal
plumes (hot spots) produce volcanic rises and may have contributed to formation of crustal
plateaus within the highlands regions through partial melting. Tessera may represent original
crust which has been highly deformed by subsequent coronae-chasmata formation and/or by
collapse of original high-standing plateaus. Isthar Terra is a unique region produced by a com-
bination of the residuum layer formed by partial melting over a mantle downwelling zone, a
thickened lower crust, and stress-induced flow in the upper crust. Interior convection and ther-
mal plumes stretch Venus’s lithosphere, causing it to fracture and allow access of magma to the
surface. If this process occurs at a slow pace, heat builds up in the interior for a few hundred
million years until a catastrophic volcanic resurfacing event occurs. Regardless of whether the
volcanic resurfacing is episodic or continuous, Venus is in a constant state of reinventing herself.

of Earth’s diameter) means that it has lost more of its internal heat over the past 4.5 Ga and
therefore is not as geologically active as Earth or Venus at the present time. However, Mars has
been, and continues to be, more geologically active than smaller Mercury or the Moon. In fact,
Mars is the only terrestrial planet whose surface retains terrains which have formed throughout
the planet’s history. The active geologic environments of Earth and Venus have destroyed the
earliest surfaces of these planets whereas Mercury and the Moon display no surfaces younger
than ∼1–2 Ga. Mars displays ancient surfaces dating back to the LHB period, intermediate aged
surfaces, and very young terrain which have formed within the past few million years.
Numerous flyby, orbiter, lander, and rover missions from the US, USSR/Russia, and Europe
have successfully explored Mars since 1965 and both orbiters (Mars Odyssey (NASA), Mars
Express (European Space Agency), and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (NASA)) and NASA’s
Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity continue to operate as of mid-2011. These missions have
provided detailed information about Mars’ interior structure, topography, atmosphere,geologic
landforms, and surface mineralogy which have been used to reconstruct the planet’s history and
investigate the role played by HO on the planet’s climate, geology, and possibility of life through
time (Barlow 2005; Kieffer et al. 1992).

Crustal Remanent Magnetization, Mars. The magnetometer/electron reﬂectometer experiment on
MGS detected zones of remanent magnetization in the ancient Martian crust. The lack of magne-
tization around the Hellas and Argyre impact basins indicate the planet’s magnetic dynamo had
ceased by the time these basins formed ∼3.8–4.0Ga (NASA/JPL/Goddard)
Mars, like the other terrestrial planets, formed by accretion in the solar nebula 4.5 Ga ago
and differentiated within a few million years as a consequence of heating by accretion and
radioactive decay. The planet’s two small heavily cratered moons, Phobos and Deimos, are likely
asteroids which were captured by Mars’ gravity after the planet formed. Mars has a mean density
of 3,933 kg m−, indicating it is a rocky body with a small iron-rich core. Gravity and topogra-
phy analyses suggest that the mean thickness of the crust ranges between 38 and 62 km, being
thicker in the southern hemisphere than in the north (Wieczorek and Zuber 2004). Geochem-
ical analysis from both orbital and surface missions indicate the crust is primarily composed of
basaltic materials, ranging from very fresh to heavily weathered. The mantle extends to a depth
of ∼1,700–2,100 km and is primarily composed of olivine and spinel (Zuber 2001). Gravity mea-
surementsfrom orbiting spacecraft combined with information about the precessional constant
obtained from landed spacecraft indicate a C/MRvalue of 0.3662, indicating that Mars has a
small core. The core is proposed to consist of iron mixed with some sulfur and has a radius of
∼1,300–1,700 km. The core may be either liquid or solid, but most recent geophysical results
favor a liquid state. Mars has no active magnetic field, indicating that the core either is solid or
is not undergoing vigorous convection if liquid. However, portions of the ancient crust display
remanent magnetization (>Fig. 3-43) and thus Mars had an active magnetic dynamo for about
the first 0.5 Ga of its history (Acuña et al. 1999).
Detailed topographic analysis by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument
on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) revealed that surface elevations range from 21.287 km (top of

Martian Topography. MGS’s MOLA experiment produced the ﬁrst detailed topography map for
Mars. The highest topography is found in the western hemisphere (left) associated with the Tharsis
bulge. The lowest elevation on the planet is in the Hellas impact basin in the eastern hemisphere
(right). The hemispheric dichotomy is clearly visible in the topography (NASA/JPL/Goddard)
the Olympus Mons volcano) to −8.180 km (inside the 2,100-km-diameterHellas impact basin),
measured relative to the planet’s equipotential surface, or geoid (3,396 km from the planet’s cen-
ter of mass) (>Fig. 3-44). The lithospheric thickness necessary to support the observed surface
topography ranges from <12 km to as much as 200 km under the large volcanoes. Topography
and gravity analyses reveal that the Tharsis volcanic region is a bulge of excess mass sitting along
the Martian equator. This bulge results in Mars’ center of mass being offset from the planet’s
center of figure by about 2 km in the direction of Tharsis.
> Figure 3-44 shows the distinct elevation difference between the northern and southern
hemispheres of Mars. Early Mariner 9 (1971–1972) and Viking Orbiter (1976–1980) obser-
vations revealed this dichotomy in both elevation and surface ages, with the area south of the
hemispheric dichotomy having higher elevation and a more heavily cratered surface, indicating
an older age, than the region north of the boundary. The dichotomy is an ancient feature, likely
forming shortly after the planet differentiated. One model for dichotomy formation invokes
enhanced convection under the northern plains, which would have thinned the crust and
allowed for a longer period of volcanism (Breuer et al. 1993; Wise et al. 1979). Another model
proposes that a large number of overlapping impact basins thinned the crust north of the
dichotomy boundary and later volcanism and sedimentary deposits covered this crater record
(Frey and Schultz 1988). MOLA topography and ground-penetrating radars on Mars Express
and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal that a heavily cratered crust of similar age to the high-
lands lies buried beneath the northern plains (Frey et al. 2002; Watters et al. 2006), but the

Terrestrial Planets 3
153
distribution of these buried basins does not correlate with crustal thickness or topography of
the northern plains and dichotomy boundary (Zuber et al. 2000). A third model invokes a
single gigantic impact to carve out the northern plains and produce the dichotomy bound-
ary (Wilhelms and Squyres 1984). Although there is no correlation between crustal thickness
and topography of the dichotomy boundary, as would be expected from a giant impact crater,
recent reconstruction of the boundary under the younger Tharsis volcanics suggests that an
oblique impact could explain the 10,600 × 8,500 km elliptical shape of the dichotomy bound-
ary (Andrews-Hanna et al. 2008). At present, the two leading hypotheses for formation of the
dichotomy boundary are the convection and giant impact models.
Geochemical data about Mars come from spectroscopic measurements obtained from
ground-based, orbiting, and surface observations, and analysis of Martian meteorites. Most
meteorites have formation ages of 4.5 Ga, but by 1979 three meteorites with different mineralo-
gies and isotopic compositions were known. These three meteorites were Shergotty (named for
Shergahti, India, where the meteorite fell in 1865), Nakhla (fell in 1941 near El-Nakhla, Egypt),
and Chassigny (fell in 1815 near Chassigny, France), and the group of meteorites having char-
acteristics similar to these three representatives became known as the shergottites, nakhlites,
and chassignites (SNC meteorites). SNC meteorites, unlike regular meteorites which originate
from asteroids, are volcanic rocks with formation ages <1.35 Ga. The youngest SNC has a for-
mation age of 0.16 Ga, indicating these rocks were derived from a planet large enough to have
been volcanically active up to a few million years ago. Composition and formation ages of SNCs
ruled out all solar system bodies except for Earth, Venus, and Mars. Dynamical considerations
make it difficult to eject a rock from Venus and have it move away from the Sun to land on
Earth. Venus’ large gravitational pull and thick atmosphere also would be detrimental to get-
ting material off the planet’s surface, so Venus was eliminatedas the possible source of the SNCs.
Analysis of oxygen isotopic ratios (O/O versus O/O) in rocks provides information about
the solar system location where rocks formed. Such an analysis revealed that SNC meteorites
did not form from the same reservoir as terrestrial and lunar rocks, eliminating Earth and the
Moon as possible source of these meteorites. Thus, by a process of elimination, Mars became the
most likely parent body for the SNCs. Trapped noble gases were discovered in the shergottite
EETA79001 (>Fig. 3-45) in 1982 which were found to be statistically identical to the isotopic
ratios of these gases in the Martian atmosphere (Bogard and Johnson 1983). This discovery
clinched the case for SNC meteorites to be pieces of the Martian crust.
Both volcanic eruptions and impact crater formation were considered as possible mecha-
nisms for ejecting the SNCs off the Martian surface. The rocks would have to reach or exceed
a velocity of 5.03 km s−to escape the planet, and even the most explosive volcanic eruptions
(which are not observed on Mars) do not provide the necessary velocity. Thus impact cratering
is the only natural process which can accelerate rocks off the Martian surface. Over 30 Mar-
tian meteorites are now cataloged and variations in their ages and compositions indicate they
came from five to eight different impact events (Nyquist et al. 2001). Many different craters
have been proposed as sources of these meteorites based on geologic and mineralogic analysis,
but scientists still cannot definitively link a particular meteorite with its source crater. So even
though scientists have samples of the Martian crust, they do not know the exact locations from
where those samples were derived. However, one perplexing issue is that all but one of the Mar-
tian meteorites have formation ages <1.35 Ga, yet <40% of Mars’ surface area displays such a
young age. The answer to this riddle likely lies in the fact that older surfaces are covered by thick
layers of fragmented material (regolith) – only younger volcanic surfaces are coherent enough
to produce rocks which can survive ejection off the planet’s surface.

Martian meteorites are classified into four main groups based on composition. Shergottites
are subdivided into basaltic, lherzolitic, olivine-orthopyroxene, and olivine-phyric, depending
on their mineralogy. Nakhlites are clinopyroxene cumulates and chassignites are olivine-rich
rocks called dunites. Of the 37 Martian meteorites currently cataloged, 27 are shergotties, seven
are nakhlites, and two are chassignites. One additional Martian meteorite (ALH84001) is differ-
ent from the SNC meteorites in age (formation age 4.1 Ga) and composition (orthopyroxene)
and appears to represent a piece of the planet’s original cumulate.
Analysis of Martian meteorites combined with spectroscopic analysis of the surface from
ground-based, orbiting, and surface landers reveals that Mars has experienced three distinct
mineralogic periods throughout its history (Bibring et al. 2006). Mars currently has a thin CO
atmosphere (0.7 mbar surface pressure) and cold surface temperatures (mean surface tempera-
ture is 240 K), which preclude the existence of liquid water on its surface – any liquid water will
either evaporate into the atmosphere or freeze into ice. Martian surfaces which have formed in
the past ∼3.5 Ga support the concept of dry environmental conditions through the presence of
ferric oxides. However, surfaces which formed prior to ∼3.5 Ga show evidence of interactions
with liquid water, indicating a change in climatic conditions from a wetter period before 3.5 Ga
to drier conditions after that time. The period from ∼3.8 to 3.5 Ga is characterized by acidic
aqueous alteration processes, including high concentrations of sulfur compounds in some areas
of Mars. The period prior to ∼3.8 Ga was water-rich but less acidic, as indicated by large con-
centrations of hydrated minerals such as phyllosilicate clays in rocks formed during this period.
Mineralogy results suggest that Mars had a thicker atmosphere early in its history which allowed
liquid water to exist on the surface. The transition to a more acidic environment at ∼3.8 Ga cor-
relates with geologic evidence of a period of increased volcanic activity. Geologic evidence also
supports the mineralogy results that the Martian atmosphere thinned around 3.5 Ga and tran-
sitioned to the drier environment seen today. Three mechanisms combined around 3.5 Ga to

thin the planet’s atmosphere. Mars, being about half the size of the Earth, has a weaker grav-
itational pull (1/3 Earth’s gravity) and thus lighter gases could escape to space by the process
of Jean’s escape. Geologic evidence from the ages of rocks with and without remanent mag-
netization indicates that the magnetic dynamo ceased operation around 4.0 Ga, allowing solar
wind particles to erode the outer portions of Mars’ atmosphere. In addition, formation of large
impact basins (such as Hellas and Argyre) around 3.8–4.0 Ga would heat up and expel some of
the Martian atmosphere as bolides made their way to the surface. The processes of Jean’s escape,
solar wind erosion, and impact erosion combined between 3.5 and 4.0 Ga to produce the thin
atmosphere and drier climatic conditions seen today (Jakosky and Phillips 2001).
Mars’ surface landforms support the notion that the planet has experienced changing cli-
matic and geologic conditions throughout its history. The planet’s history is divided into three
periods, based on stratigraphic relationships, crater densities, and occurrence of specific geo-
logic processes. The earliest period, the Noachian, extended from the time when the planet’s
surface solidified until ∼3.7 Ga. The Noachian is characterized by high impact rates during the
LHB, formation of large impact basins, creation of the hemispheric dichotomy, high degra-
dation rates, and formation of small channels and hydrated minerals by liquid water. The
Hesperian Period ran from ∼3.7–3.0 Ga and was a period of declining impact rates, increased
volcanic activity, transition from an acidic aqueous environment to dry conditions, deposition
of much of the northern plains sedimentary deposits, and formation of the large outflow chan-
nels by catastrophic floods. The most recent period, the Amazonian, covers the period since
3.0 Ga and is characterized by low impact rates, localized volcanic activity (mainly in the Thar-
sis and Elysium regions), localized channel formation, low degradation rates, deposition and
sublimation of ice in the polar regions, aeolian activity, and localized ice deposits in nonpolar
regions.
The Martian surface retains a larger number of impact craters than the surfaces of Earth and
Venus. Over 42,000 craters ⩾5-km-diameter have been cataloged, but the crater density varies
considerably across the surface. The region south of the dichotomy boundary is heavily cratered
and dates to the LHB during the Noachian period. Noachian-aged craters are typically heavily
degraded, with missing rims, infilled floors, and missing ejecta blankets and interior structures.
Modeling of crater degradation by different geologic processes suggests that Noachian-aged
craters were modified mainly by fluvial, mass wasting, and aeolian processes (Craddock and
Howard 2002). Craters formed during the Hesperian and Amazonian periods are less heavily
modified and retain evidence of their original morphologies. Many of these craters are sur-
rounded by a layered (fluidized) ejecta blanket which displays one, two, or multiple ejecta
layers (>Fig. 3-46). Characteristics of these layered ejecta blankets suggest that vaporization of
subsurface volatiles is primarily responsible for formation of this ejecta morphology, although
interaction of the ejecta curtain with the Martian atmosphere also may contribute (Barlow
2005). The diameter of the smallest crater displaying a layered ejecta morphology can be used
with crater depth/diameter relationships to estimate the depth to subsurface volatile (ice and
maybe liquid) layers. Such analyses indicate that ice lies within a few centimeters of the surface
at latitudes poleward of ∼45○and within 10s to 100s of meters depth in the equatorial region.
Martian complex craters (>6–7 km in diameter) display shallower depths and flatter floors than
simple craters and often exhibit wall terraces and central peaks. However, some complex craters
display a central depression (central pit) which can occur either directly on the crater floor or
atop a central peak (> Fig. 3-47). Central pit craters are only observed on Mars and Jupiter’s
two largest moons (Ganymede and Callisto), suggesting that the pit forms by vaporization or
melting of target ice during crater formation.

Orbiting spacecraft have been continuously observing the Martian surface since 1996,
which has allowed long-term monitoring for changing events. This continuous surface mon-
itoring has revealed formation of several new small impact craters (Malin et al. 2006), which
has helped to constrain the impact flux at Mars during recent times. Near-surface ice is

sometimes exposed by these new impact craters, providing additional constraints on the depth
to subsurface ice layers at different latitudes (Byrne et al. 2009).
Information on the depth to subsurface ice-rich layers obtained by crater analysis can be
compared with orbiter and lander experiments. Neutron spectrometers aboard Mars Odyssey
provide insights into the present-daydistribution of hydrogen, and thus water, within the upper
meter of Martian regolith. High-energy cosmic rays strike the Martian surface, dislodging neu-
trons from atoms within surface minerals. Energies of these neutrons determine if they are
thermal (energy <.eV), epithermal (0.4 eV–0.7 MeV), or fast (0.7–1.6 MeV) neutrons. Var-
ious types of neutrons interact in different ways with atoms and molecules within surface
materials. Hydrogen, which typically occurs as HO within the inner solar system, is a good
absorber of epithermal and fast neutrons, whereas COis a poor absorber of epithermal and
thermal neutrons. Distribution of HO within the upper meterof the surface can be determined
by comparing the fluxes of different neutrons given off by the Martian surface. Results of this
study (>Fig. 3-48) reveal that the polar regions have high concentrations of near-surface HO
ice, consistent with the proposed distribution of subsurface ice based on models of solar inso-
lation and the expected geothermal heat flux (Feldman et al. 2004). The high northern latitude
landing site of the 2008 Phoenix mission was selected based on neutron spectrometer results,

and Phoenix succeeded in detecting ice within a few centimeters depth. Equatorial regions of
Mars are expected to be dry based on ice stability models, but HO was detected over broad
areas within this region by the neutron spectrometers. This HO signature could result from
either buried ice or the presence of hydrated minerals.
HO and COices are exposed on the Martian surface in the polar regions. Earth-based
telescopic observations revealed that the Martian polar caps expand and retreat on seasonal
cycles (>Fig. 3-49). The polar cap is largest in winter and a small remnant cap persists through
the summer. Temperature and compositional analyses reveal that the seasonally varying cap is
composed of COice, which condenses directly from atmospheric clouds (“the polar hood”)
during Martian fall and winter. COice sublimates during spring into summer, leaving behind
the remnant cap which is composed of HO ice. The north polar remnant cap is about 1,100 km
in diameter and is centered near the north rotational pole. The ∼400-km-diameter south polar
remnant cap is offset from the south pole, with its center near 87○S 315○E. Deposition and sub-
limation of COice produces a variety of intriguing features around the polar caps (>Fig. 3-50).
The polar ice caps lie atop a thick sequence of layered ice and dust (the polar layered deposits,
PLD), which likely preserves a record of climate cycles similar to terrestrial tree rings.
Landforms suggestive of subsurface and surface ice deposits are seen in many regions of
Mars, including within the equatorial zone. Irregular depressions, similar to thermokarst pits
on Earth which form from removal of subsurface ice, are seen in the Martian mid-northern lati-
tudes, and polygonal terrain, formed by freeze-thaw cycles in terrestrial permafrost regions, are

South Polar Terrain, Mars. The deposition and sublimation of CO2 throughout the Martian year
leads to formation of unusual landforms. This series of mesas, pits, and grooves (nicknamed
“Swiss Cheese Terrain”) is one example of the icy landforms associated with the south polar cap
(NASA/JPL/MSSS)
common near both poles (>Fig. 3-51). Sinuous ridges near the south pole have been proposed
to be glacial eskers and parallel lines of small mounds (“thumbprint terrain”) may be blocks
deposited in moraines of retreating glaciers. Numerous deposits showing evidence of flow lines
have been revealed to be ice-rich by radar investigations and are now generally interpreted to
be dust-covered glacial deposits (>Fig. 3-52).
Ice is only deposited over the Martian poles under current climatic conditions, but many of
the putative glacial deposits are found at lower latitudes. These features are typically no more
than a few million years old, based on counts of superposed craters, indicating that the Martian
climate must have undergone recent short-lived changes if these deposits formed from precipi-
tation ofsnow. Dynamical modeling suggests that gravitational perturbations from Jupiteraffect
Mars’ orbital eccentricity, inclination, and obliquity on cycles of a few million years, similar to
Earth’s Milankovitch cycles. These models find that Mars’ obliquity can vary from almost 0○to
over 80○with a most probable value of 41.8○(compared to its present value of 25○) over a period
of ∼2.5 Ma. Eccentricity can vary from ∼0 to 0.12 with a most probable value of 0.068 (current
value is 0.093) on a ∼1.7 Ma period (Laskar et al. 2004). Mars is currently moving from a lower
to higher eccentricity period and from higher to lower obliquity. Polar regions receive more
solar insolation during higher obliquity periods, causing COand HO ices in the polar caps
and PLDs to sublimate. These gases increase the density of the Martian atmosphere and surface
temperatures may rise from greenhouse warming. Precipitation becomes more common under

denser atmospheric conditions, but whether this occurs as snow or rain depends on the com-
bination of obliquity and orbital values. The last high obliquity period occurred about 1–2 Ma
ago when obliquity reached a moderate value of ∼35○, but obliquities near 45○likely occurred
around 6 and 9 Ma ago. The putative equatorial cold-based glaciers and a mid-latitude ice-rich
mantling layer likely formed by snowfall during the moderately high obliquity period around
1–2 Ma ago.
Glacial processes may have affected the Martian surface in recent times, but liquid water
produced numerous fluvial landforms earlier in Martian history (Baker 1982). Martian chan-
nels formed by flowing liquid are divided into valley networks and outflow channels. A third
type of channel (fretted channels) occurs along the dichotomy boundary and may have been
carved by warm-based glaciers. Valley networks are found in the ancient southern highlands
and on flanks of younger volcanoes (> Fig. 3-53). Many display dendritic patterns, and inter-
connections between valley networks and drainage basins suggest that rainfall was a major
source for the water carving these channels. However, some valley networks show evidence
of a sapping origin, suggesting both rainfall and groundwater contributed to formation of these
features. Valley network formation in Noachian terrains rapidly declines near the end of the
LHB, with younger systems only being found in association with volcanoes. Thinning of the
Martian atmosphere between 3.5 and 4.0 Ga and the accompanying change to a more arid cli-
mate probably eliminated valley network formation by rainfall and concentrated subsequent

channel formation in regions where either magma could maintain near-surface groundwater
systems or volcanic activity produced localized precipitation.
Outflow channels are much larger than valley networks, with widths on the order of tens of
kilometers and lengths of thousands of kilometers (>Fig. 3-54). Outflow channels formed dur-
ing the Hesperian and Amazonian periods under climatic conditions similar to today. Outflow
channels originate from large depressions, often filled with a jumble of rocks called chaotic
terrain. Characteristics of outflow channels suggest that they form from catastrophic release
of groundwater, similar to the catastrophic flooding that formed the Channeled Scablands in
eastern Washington. The source of this groundwater is likely ground ice melted by volcanic or
impact processes.
Other evidences of liquid water, particularly during the Noachian, include impact craters
with rims breached by channels and sediment-covered floors. These are interpreted to be
ancient lakebeds (paleolakes). Distributary fans are sometimes observed where the channel
enters the crater floor and may be analogous to terrestrial deltas (>Fig. 3-55). Alluvial fans also
have been recognized in several impact craters. Opportunity rover has found mineralogic evi-
dence that an acidic, briny sea existed in the Meridiani Planum region for an extended period of
time (> Fig. 3-56), and Spirit rover has found evidence of lakebed and hydrothermal deposits
near its landing site in Gusev crater. Recent evidence of water flow can be seen in small gul-
lies formed along crater and canyon walls (> Fig. 3-57). Although COand methane (CH)
have been proposed as the eroding fluids, models show that current conditions on Mars favor
gully formation by HO. Seepage of groundwater (Malin and Edgett 2000) and/or melting of

of the fluids carving these gullies.
The thin Martian atmosphere undergoes large pressure and temperaturevariations on daily,
seasonal, and annual cycles which produce surface winds. Aeolian features are therefore com-
mon on the Martian surface and are among the landforms seen to change in appearance during
the decades ofspacecraft observation. Dust transport is obvious on Mars, both in terms ofevery-
day dust in the atmosphere (landers often see a pink sky because of atmospheric dust) and the
frequent dust storms which can range in size from localized to global. Dust devils (>Fig. 3-58)
help to transfer dust particles from the surface into the atmosphere (and sometimes help clean
dust off the solar panels on Spirit and Opportunity) and can help initiate the saltation (hopping
motion) of larger sand particles. Aeolian depositional features on Mars range from large sand
seas called ergs to numerous sand dune deposits and small ripples (> Fig. 3-59). Both bright
and dark wind streaks are seen on Mars and their changing orientations provide insights into
wind shifts on both seasonal and longer timescales. Yardangs, ventifacts, and the presence of
pits and grooves in surface rocks (>Fig. 3-60) are indicators of the erosive power of sediment-
carrying winds. Dust devils remove dust from the surface, leaving behind dark tracks where the
underlying darker bedrock is revealed.
Mass wasting processes also are evident on the surface of Mars. Large complex craters
often show wall terraces, formed when their oversteepened walls collapsed under the influence

the canyon’s long history (>Fig. 3-61). Crater analysis indicates that these landslides have been
occurring since at least 3.5 Ga ago and the youngest slides are <50 Ma. Both dry granular flows
and wet flows match the morphologies of these landslides and both mechanisms probably have
operated at different times.

Martian volcanic features were first detected by Mariner 9 and range from lava plains to
a variety of volcanic edifices. Spectroscopic observations from orbiting spacecraft suggest that
the surface composition is largely basalt, and this is consistent with the types of volcanic fea-
tures observed across the planet. Flood basalts appear to have erupted throughout Martian
history, being exposed as Noachian-aged intercrater plains, Hesperian-aged ridged plains, and
Amazonian-aged lava flows in the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces. Both large and small
shield volcanoes are scattered across the planet, with the highest concentrations occurring in
Tharsis and Elysium.
The largest volcano known in the solar system is 21.3-km-high Olympus Mons, which
lies on the western edge of the Tharsis bulge (> Fig. 3-62). Three other large shield volca-
noes (Ascraeus, Pavonis, and Arsia Montes) are aligned in a northeast-to-southwest orientation
along the crest of the Tharsis bulge. The multiple calderas at the summits of these large shield
volcanoes together with numerous lava flows along their flanks indicate these volcanoes under-
went multiple eruptions. Crater counts suggest that the most recent eruptions occurred about
40 Ma ago, suggesting that these volcanoes, particularly Olympus Mons, might still be active.
The other large volcano in Tharsis is 1,600-km-diameter Alba Mons, which reaches a height of
6.8 km and is surrounded by a system of circumferential graben (>Fig. 3-63). Smaller volcanic
domes (tholii) in the Tharsis region are small but older shield volcanoes, many of which have
their bases covered by more recent lava flows (Hodges and Moore 1994). Crater counts indicate
that volcanism in the Tharsis region has been occurring since the Noachian and successive lava
flows over Mars’ history have gradually constructed the bulge seen today.
The Tharsis volcanic province dominates the western hemisphere of Mars, whereas volcanic
activity in the eastern hemisphere is concentrated in Elysium. Three volcanoes constitute the
Elysium volcanicregion: AlborTholus, Hecates Tholus, and Elysim Mons. AlborTholus is a 160-
km-diameter Noachian-to-Hesperian-aged shield volcano. Hecates Tholus primarily formed in
the Hesperian, although its activity may have continued into the Amazonian. It is 200 km in
diameter with a small caldera, numerous channels on its flanks, and a possible pyroclastic (ash-
rich) deposit on its western flank. Four-hundred-km-diameter Elysium Mons is the youngest

surrounding the volcano is clearly visible (NASA/Goddard)
of the Elysium volcanoes with a Late Hesperian to Early Amazonian age. It is the tallest of the
Elysium volcanoes with a height of 14 km.
Recent volcanic activity has been concentrated in the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic
provinces, but earlier activity was more extensive. The Hesperian period witnessed not only the
formation of volcanic edifices in Tharsis and Elysium but also creation of the low-relief Syrtis
Major volcano and extrusion of low-viscosity lavas which formed the ridged plains. The oldest
volcanic edifices on Mars are the paterae, which are large but very low-relief (slopes <○) vol-
canoes. Paterae have basaltic compositions, but their flanks are covered by easily erodible ash
layers which are highly dissected by wind and/or fluvial activity (>Fig. 3-64). The ash layers are
produced either by a steam explosion caused when magma encounters water, or by rapid ascent
of deep-sourced magmas. The explosive phase of paterea formation occurred in Late Noachian
to Early Hesperian, but later effusive lava flows continued into the Amazonian.
The youngest volcanic unit on Mars lies in the Cerberus Planitia area, which is west of Thar-
sis and east of Elysium. Crater analysis of flood basalts in this area suggest formation ages from
3 to 100 Ma ago (Berman and Hartmann 2002; Werner et al. 2003). These low-viscosity lavas
were extruded from fractures and/or small shield volcanoes on the western side of Cerberus
Planitia.
Most volcanic activity on Mars consists of low-viscosity basaltic eruptions, but a possible
Amazonian-aged ash deposit from explosive volcanism lies southwest of the Tharsis shields
in the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF). Radar observations suggest a maximum thickness
of 580 m for this deposit (Carter et al. 2009). The material is fine-grained, as indicated by
the presence of aeolian erosional features such as yardangs, is porous, and shows no evidence
of fine-scale internal layering similar to the PLDs, although larger-scale layers are observed
(Carter et al. 2009; Mandt et al. 2008). Mars Odyssey’s Gamma Ray Spectrometer detected a
high concentration of chlorine coincident with the deposit (Karunatillake et al. 2009). All of
MFF’s characteristics are consistent with it being a type of pyroclastic deposit known as an ign-
imbrite (Mandt et al. 2008), which originated from explosive activity in the corridor between
the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces. Explosive eruptions in Tharsis are suggested to have
produced layered deposits in other regions around the planet.

era is 300-km-diameter, 2-km-high Tyrrhena Mons, located northeast of the Hellas impact basin
(NASA/JPL)
Northwest of Olympus Mons and extending 300–700 km from the edge of the volcano is
a region of blocks, arcuate ridges, and deep extensional troughs called the Olympus Mons
aureole (>Fig. 3-65). Possible origins for the aureole deposit include both volcanic (eroded pre-
Olympus Mons shield volcano, eroded lava flows, or pyroclastic deposits) and tectonic (failure
of the volcano flanks) mechanisms. Gravity, topography, and image data support a tectonic ori-
gin for the aureole, suggesting that the northwestern flank of Olympus Mons collapsed and slid
awayfrom the volcano (McGovern et al. 2004). A scarp up to 10 km in height defines the edge of
Olympus Mons on the side facing the aureole and its origin is consistent with the flank collapse
model.
Like Venus, Mars is a single-plate planet and shows no sign of plate tectonic activity at
the present time. Plate tectonics early in Martian history have been proposed, particularly to
explain the striped nature of the remanent magnetization recorded by rocks in the highlands
(>Fig. 3-43). However, other mechanisms can explain the magnetization pattern and models of
early plate tectonics cannot explain observations of present day crustal thickness, timing of the
magnetic dynamo, declining rate of volcanism, and formation of the crustal dichotomy (Breuer
and Spohn 2003). Thus tectonism is localized in extent and is primarily associated with mantle
upwelling and thermal plume activity responsible for Martian volcanism. Wrinkle ridges are
the dominant form of compressional tectonics observed on Mars and form when layered lava
plains sag under their weight (>Fig. 3-66). Wrinkle ridges are broad linear arches with super-
posed ridges which are surface expressions of subsurface thrust faults. Extensional fractures are
commonly associated with the volcanic centers, particularly the Tharsis bulge, and indicate that
the lithosphere underwent substantial stretching in response to volcanic loads.

processes and possibly some fluvial erosion.
The possibility of current (extant) or past (extinct) life on Mars has intrigued scientists and
the public for centuries (see discussion in Barlow 2008). Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiapar-
elli (1835–1910) reported telescopic observations of thin dark lines crossing the planet’s surface
in 1877. Schiaparelli termed these lines canali, Italian for channel. Channels are formed by natu-
ral processes such as aeolian or fluvial erosion or by tectonic fracturing. However, the term was
incorrectly translated into English as canal, which implies a waterway engineered by intelligent
lifeforms. American astronomer Percival Lowell (1855–1916) promulgated the idea that the
canals were artificial waterways, constructed by a dying race of Martians to bring water from
the melting polar caps to the thirsty populace living in cities near the equator. Astronomers
argued for many decades about whether the canals were real or simply optical illusions caused
by poor seeing conditions. The debate was not resolved until spacecraft began visiting Mars in
1965. Early images from the Mariners 4, 6, and 7 flyby missions revealed no signs of canals,
Martian cities, or even vegetation, and these missions were the first to reveal the thinness of the
atmosphere and inability of Mars to retain liquid water on its surface. However, the Mariner
9 discovery of channels formed by past episodes of flowing water reignited the possibility that
lifeforms may have arisen on Mars. This led to the two 1976 Viking missions, each of which
consisted of an orbiter and a lander. The landers carried a series of experiments designed to test
Martian soil for evidence of microbial life. Viking Lander 1 landed in Chryse Planitia (22.48○N
312.03○E) on July 20, 1976, followed by Viking Lander 2 in Utopia Planitia (47.97○N 134.26○E)

on September 9, 1976. The biology experiments were designed to detect soil organics and waste
products produced by microorganisms under a variety of humidity, temperature, and radiation
conditions. The experiments indicated that Martian soil is highly reactive but that it is primarily
chemical reactions resulting from the oxidized nature of the soil rather than biologic activity
which produced the observed results.
Scientists generally considered the question of Martian life to be resolved until 1996, when
analysis of the ancient Martian meteorite ALH84001 suggested it contained signatures of Mar-
tian life (McKay et al. 1996). Carbonates within the meteorite contain mixtures of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, magnetite, and iron sulfides which can be produced by bacteria. Elec-
tron microscope images also revealed tiny elongated features interpreted as possible fossilized
bacteria (>Fig. 3-68). Subsequent investigations of the ALH84001 signatures have questioned
the original biologic interpretations. The putative fossilized bacteria are either an artifact from
sample preparation or terrestrial contamination. Chemical signatures are generally attributed
to inorganic processes or terrestrial contamination. Thus the ALH84001 evidence is considered
too weak to support the claim that it contains evidence of ancient Martian life.
Low temperature, lack of abundant liquid water, oxidizing soil conditions, and penetra-
tion of radiation to the surface produce surface conditions which are inhospitable to terrestrial
biology. Any extant Martian life has likely migrated underground where conditions may be
more conducive for biologic activity. No signs of extinct or extant life have been detected by
surface landers or rovers, but future missions, such as NASA’s 2011 Mars Science Laboratory
(recently named Curiosity) and ESA’s 2018 ExoMars, are designed to more completely explore
Mars’ exobiological potential.

Mercury
Mercury is the smallest of the terrestrial planets, with a mean diameter of 4,879 km (38% of
Earth). The size, combined with a mass of .× kg, gives the planet a high density of
5,400 kg m−, indicating that Mercury contains a large amount of iron in its interior. The planet
has the most elliptical orbit among the eight major planets (e = 0.2058), resulting in the intensity
of sunlight varying by a factor of 2.5 between the planet’s closest and furthest distances from the
Sun. Tidal forces from the Sun combined with Mercury’s elliptical orbit have placed Mercury
in a 3:2 spin-orbit coupling, meaning that the planet rotates exactly three times for every two
orbits around the Sun. Tidal forces also have affected Mercury’s obliquity, placing the rotation
axis almost perpendicular to the planet’s orbital plane.
Mercury is difficult to observe with Earth-based telescopes because of its small size and
proximity to the Sun. The first detailed information about the planet’s surface and interior
came from the Mariner 10 mission, which passed by Mercury three times in 1974–1975
(Strom and Sprague 2003; Vilas et al. 1988). The mission’s orbital characteristics combined
with Mercury’s 3:2 spin-orbit coupling resulted in image acquisition of only 45% of the planet’s
surface (> Fig. 3-69). Mariner 10 was actually in orbit around the Sun, not Mercury, limiting

the amount of gravity information which could be obtained about the planet. Improvements
in both surface coverage and internal structure will come from the MErcury Surface, Space
ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, which made three fly-
bys of Mercury between January 2008 and September 2009 and entered Mercury orbit in
March 2011.
Mariner 10 revealed the high density of the planet and also detected a weak magnetic field
(0.07% Earth’s field strength) around Mercury. These two observations indicate that Mercury’s
iron core is larger relative to the planet’s volume than that of any other terrestrial planet core.
Lack of orbital gravity data precludes a precise determination of the C/MRvalue until MES-
SENGER has been in orbit for a longer period, but models suggest that 42% of Mercury’s volume
is taken up by its iron core. In comparison, Earth’s core is only 16% of our planet’s volume. Mer-
cury’s core is estimated to have a radius of ∼1,800 km while the mantle is ∼600 km thick and the
crustal thickness ranges from 100–300 km. The large volume occupied by the core may be the
result of an early catastrophic impact on Mercury which stripped away a substantial portion of
the planet’s original crust and mantle.
Scientists have debated the origin of Mercury’s magnetic field since its detection by Mariner
10. One possibility is that Mercury’s core has completely solidified, shutting off the dynamo
process and leaving the magnetic field as a remnant field preserved in Mercury’s crust. The other
model is that Mercury’s core remains partially molten and the field is produced by an active
dynamo at the present time. Results from MESSENGER’s flybys do not support the remnant
magnetic field model and thus Mercury’s dynamo appears to still be operating (Solomon et al.
2008).
Mariner 10’s cameras imaged about 45% of Mercury’s surface and MESSENGER has largely
completed image mapping of the planet. Mercury’s geologic history is divided into five peri-
ods based on stratigraphic and crater density analysis. The oldest terrains have formation ages
>4.0 and are placed in the pre-Tolstojan period. The Tolstojan period covers materials formed
between ∼4.0–3.9 Ga and is followed by the Calorian period, which extended from ∼3.9–3.5 Ga.
The youngest geologic periods are the Mansurian (3.5–3.0 Ga) and the Kuiperian (∼1.0 Ga).
Mercury has only a very low-density haze of atoms and molecules above its surface, pro-
ducing an exosphere. The particles in the exosphere include those captured from the solar wind
(hydrogen, helium, and oxygen) and atoms sputtered from the surface by impact of solar wind
particles (calcium, sodium, and potassium). This exosphere is too thin to produce any fluvial,
glacial, or aeolian features on Mercury.
Impact craters dominate in all surface images, indicating that Mercury’s crust cooled and
solidified early in the planet’s history. Most of the surface dates from the LHB, although
the smooth plains are slightly younger (Strom et al. 2008). Several large impact basins
occur on Mercury, including the 1,550-km-diameter Caloris basin (> Fig. 3-70) and the
recently discovered 715-km-diameter Rembrandt basin. Basin formation strongly influenced
the subsequent volcanic and tectonic evolution of regions in and around these large impact
structures.
Earth-based radar observations suggest that some impact craters near Mercury’s poles
may contain ice deposits. Floors of these high-latitude impact craters are in perpetual shadow
because of Mercury’s small obliquity. The cold temperatures in these perpetually shadowed
regions trap volatiles, which will migrate to these cold traps regardless of where the volatiles
originated. MESSENGER will investigate the polar regions and its neutron spectrometer will
determine if the radar signature seen from Earth is indicative of water ice deposits on crater
floors.

CalorisBasin, Mercury. Mariner 10 observationswere limited to the eastern rim of the Caloris Basin.
Based on those images, Caloris was estimated to be ∼1,300km in diameter (inneryellow dashed cir-
cle). MESSENGER has imaged the entire basin and ﬁnds the diameter to be closer to 1,550km (outer
blue dashed circle) (NASA/Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL)/Carnegie Institution
of Washington/Brown University)
Mariner 10 imagery revealed two types of plains units, the intercrater plains and smooth
plains. Intercrater plains, which exist between craters on heavily cratered terrain, were gener-
ally considered to be volcanic in origin, but controversy ensued regarding whether the smooth
plains were volcanic or impact ejecta. MESSENGER albedo and color data suggest that most of
the planet’s crust is of volcanic origin (Denevi et al. 2009) and crater analysis indicates that the
smooth plains often display statistically different ages than the large basins (Strom et al. 2008).
These observations indicate that both intercraterand smooth plains are likely volcanic in origin.
MESSENGER data have revealed an enhanced role of volcanism in Mercury’s history (Head
et al. 2008). Mercury’s albedo is lower than the Moon’s, suggesting widespread distribution of
opaque components with high iron and/or titanium components which originated in Mercury’s
mantle (Denevi et al. 2009). High-resolution images reveal volcanic vents which are the likely
source regions of plains material (Head et al. 2008). Low-viscosity magmas dominated in Mer-
cury’s volcanic history, as indicated by the prevalence of lava flows and lack of large volcanic
edifices. The floors of most large impact basins appear to be flooded by postimpact volcanism.
The first possible shield volcano detected on Mercury is a small domed feature with irregular
depressions located along the southern margin of the Caloris basin (>Fig. 3-71).
Mercury’s tectonic environment is unique among the terrestrial planets. Extensional tec-
tonics are limited to the interiors of large impact basin, typically as circumferential graben near
the basin rim but occasionally as radial graben near the basin center (> Fig. 3-72) (Watters
et al. 2009). The circumferential graben are similar to those seen in mare-filled lunar basins
and result from sagging of lava-filled basin floors, creating extensional stresses near the basin
rim. Radial graben patterns may result from updoming of the surface by subsurface magma
intrusions.

Pantheon Fossae, Mercury. Pantheon Fossae is an unusual feature located near the center of the

impact crater. Magma upwelling after the crater impact is proposed to have stretched the crust
and formed the fracture pattern (NASA/JHU APL/Carnegie Institution of Washington)

Terrestrial Planets 3
177
⊡Fig. 3-73
Hilly and Lineated Terrain, Mercury. Antipodal to the center of the Caloris Basin is a region of dis-
rupted terrain called the Hilly and Lineated Terrain. Seismic waves created by the Caloris impact
and focused on the antipodal point by the liquid iron core provided the energy to cause vertical
displacement of the surface (NASA/JHU APL/Carnegie Institution of Washington)
The Hilly and Lineated Terrain is an unusual area antipodal to the Caloris Basin. It consists
of severely disrupted terrain and covers an area of at least 360,000 km. The hills, depres-
sions, and valleys constituting the Hilly and Lineated Terrain disrupt preexisting landforms
such as impact craters (>Fig. 3-73). These unusual features resulted from the impact forming
the Caloris Basin. Seismic waves generated by the Caloris impact passed through the interior,
including the core which was probably entirely molten at the time. Passage through the liquid
core focused the seismic waves on the point antipodal to the center of Caloris. The convergence
of the seismic energy on this point resulted in very strong shaking and vertical displacement of
the surface, creating the highly disrupted terrain.
Most of the tectonic features seen on Mercury are compressional features, including wrinkle
ridges within lava plains. Mariner 10 and MESSENGER imagery reveal a global distribution of
linear to arcuate lobate scarps (>Fig. 3-74), which are geologic expressions of surface-breaking
thrust faults (Watters et al. 2009). Lobate scarps appear to be Calorian or younger in age, show-
ing little embayment by lava flows in smooth plains units that they cross. They often transect
preexisting impact craters, resulting in apparent rim offsets which can be used to determine the
angle and height of the thrust fault. Distribution of the lobate scarps indicates global contrac-
tion, and the amount of crustal displacement produced by the scarps suggests that Mercury’s
radius has decreased by 1–2 km since the planet’s formation. The cause of this planetary shrink-
ing is the gradual solidification of Mercury’s large iron core. Iron undergoes a decrease in
volume as it transitions from liquid to solid. Thus solidification results in a decrease in the core’s
size, which in turn causes the entire planet to shrink. Complete solidification of Mercury’s core
would reduce the planet’s radius by 17 km, supporting magnetic field results that the core is still
partially molten.
Mariner 10 observations suggested that volcanism on Mercury had ceased shortly after the
LHB as planetary contraction shut off magma access to the surface. Crater analysis from MES-
SENGER imagery indicate that volcanism has continued into more recent times, perhaps as
recently as the last 1 Ga in localized areas (Strom et al. 2008). The post-Mariner 10 view was
that Mercury was a geologically dead world which currently only experienced the occasional

expression of a thrust fault formed as Mercury contracts in response to the solidiﬁcation of its large

formation of impact craters and perhaps compressional tectonics as the planet continued to
contract. Initial results from the MESSENGER flybys suggest that this paradigm requires some
revision. A better understanding of Mercury’s geologic history and internal structure will be
obtained now that MESSENGER has achieved orbit and has begun its full investigation of the
innermost planet.

Moon
Earth’s Moon is not officially a terrestrial planet since it orbits Earth rather than the Sun, but its
rocky composition, interior structure, and geologic history make it similar enough to the ter-
restrial planets that it is usually included in discussions of the inner solar system. The Moon is
Earth’s closest celestial neighbor and was therefore the first objective of our planet’s space explo-
ration program. It is also the only body other than Earth which has been investigated by human
explorers. Earth-based telescopes revealed that the Moon’s two terrain units, the bright high-
lands and the dark maria, were different in terms of crater density (and thus age), roughness,

Moon. The brightness diﬀerences between the brighter highlands and dark maria are evident in
this view of the lunar nearside obtained by Clementine (NASA/JPL/US Geological Survey)
and topography (>Fig. 3-75). The heavily cratered highlands are higher, older, and rougher than
the sparsely cratered maria. However, Earth-based telescopic observations only provide infor-
mation about ∼50% of the lunar surface. Gravitational interactions (tidal forces) between Earth
and the Moon have slowed the Moon’s rotation so it is synchronous with its orbital period of
27.3 Earth days. This synchronous rotation (or 1:1 spin-orbit coupling) means that one side of
the Moon, the nearside, always faces Earth. The side facing away from Earth is the lunar farside
and can only be explored by spacecraft.
Early lunar landers, including the Soviet Luna 2, 9, and 13 missions and the US Ranger
and Surveyor series, proved that impact cratering had not produced an exceptionally thick
regolith which would swallow up landed spacecraft and their human occupants. Orbiting mis-
sions, including the Soviet Luna 10, 11, 12, 14, 19, and 22 missions and the US Lunar Orbiters,
provided detailed views of the surface geology, including that of the farside which is never vis-
ible from Earth. These missions paved the way for human visitation of the Moon in the Apollo
missions, including surface exploration and sample return by the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and
17 crews (>Fig. 3-76). Although the Soviet Union never landed cosmonauts on the lunar sur-
face, they did achieve successful teleoperation of surface rovers (Lunakhod 1 and 2) and robotic
sample return (Lunas 16, 20, and 24). This first phase of lunar exploration lasted from 1959 to
1976 and significantly expanded our understanding of the Moon’s interior structure, surface
geology, topography, and geologic history (Heiken et al. 1991).
A second phase of lunar exploration occurred between 1994 and 1999 with the US Clemen-
tine and Lunar Prospector missions. Clementine orbited the Moon between February 19 and
May 3, 1994, providing detailed maps of crustal composition and topography. Lunar Prospector

Taurus-Littrow valley of the Moon (NASA)
orbited the Moon between January 11, 1998 and July 31, 1999. That mission produced global
maps of elemental variations within the crust, investigated evidence of ice deposits near the
lunar poles, provided low-altitude mapping of the lunar gravity field, and identified regions of
crustal remnant magnetization.
The Moon is currently undergoing a third period of intense exploration with a much
more international flavor than the previous exploration periods. ESA’s first Small Missions for
Advanced Research and Technology (SMART-1) orbiter provided images and compositional
information between 2004 and 2006. Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE;
also called Kaguya) orbited the Moon in 2007–2009 and included instruments to provide sur-
face images, topography data, composition maps, crustal remanent magnetization data, gravity
field detail, and information about the space environment. China’s Chang’e 1 orbiter (2007–
2009) imaged the Moon’s surface in preparation for future landers, provided topography data,
produced composition maps, and investigated the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth–
Moon environment. India also participated in this international investigation of the Moon with
the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter (2008–2009), which carried a camera, spectrometers, a laser altime-
ter, and a radar system to investigate the lunar surface. The most recent addition to this armada
of lunar missions is the US Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and Lunar Crater Observa-
tion and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), which reached lunar orbit on June 23, 2009. Like the other
lunar missions, LRO carries a camera, laser altimeter, radar, and a variety of spectrometers oper-
ating in different wavelengths to thoroughly explore the lunar surface. LCROSS was deliberately
crashed into Cabeus crater near the lunar south pole on October 9, 2009, to investigate the
possibility of ice deposits within this crater.

The Moon is the only solar system body other than Earth for which scientists have acquired
a full complement of geophysical measurements. The numerous orbiting missions have pro-
duced detailed gravity maps up to degree and order 165 for the nearside and degree and order
90 for the farside. Such maps reveal that nearside impact basins are typically associated with
gravity highs, indicating the presence of excess mass (mascons) under these basins. However,
farside basins usually exhibit negative gravity anomaly rings (indicating mass loss), although
some of these features also exhibit a central gravity high due to mantle uplift under the basins
(Namiki et al. 2009). Gravity measurements give a lunar C/MRvalue of 0.39, indicating that the
Moon has only a very small core. These gravity results are supported by seismic data recorded
by passive seismometers deployed by the Apollo missions, which suggest that the Moon has
a solid inner core of approximately 240 km radius surrounded by a liquid core extending out
to 480 km radius from the Moon’s center. The Moon exhibits little seismic activity, with most
moonquakes being initiated either by tidal forces when the Moon’s elliptical orbit brings it clos-
est to Earth or by small impact events. Surface heat flow was measured at the Apollo 15 and 17
landing sites and was found to vary from 22 to 31 mW m−(Heiken et al. 1991). These values
are much less than Earth’s average heat flow (75 mW m−), supporting geologic analyses which
indicate that endogenic geologic processes are not actively occurring at the present time on
the Moon.
Magnetometers aboard orbiting lunar spacecraft have found no indication of an actively
produced magnetic field, but some rocks on the lunar surface retain a remnant magnetization
suggesting a lunar magnetic dynamo operated in the past. About 5% of the maria retain a signif-
icant remnant magnetization whereas that of the highlands is more heterogenous and diverse.
Localized strong magneticanomalies have been detected (>Fig. 3-77)and are proposed toresult
from cometary impacts, solar magnetic storms, or by ejecta interactions causing magnetization
of regions antipodal to major impacts.
Global topography maps have now been produced for the Moon from laser altimeter mea-
surements on many of the orbiting spacecraft (>Fig. 3-78). These maps reveal that topography
varies by 16 km across the Moon (Zuber et al. 1994). Maria are located in topographic depres-
sions, typically ranging in depth from 2 to 4 km below the reference radius. The lowest region
on the Moon is the 2,500-km-diameter South Pole-Aitken Basin, located in the southern hemi-
sphere of the farside and reaching a maximum depth of 8.2 km below the reference radius.
The highlands are topographically higher, ranging up to 6 km or more above the reference
radius. Farside highlands are higher than their counterparts on the nearside and have been
suggested to include ejecta deposits from the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Combined topography
and gravity data indicate the lunar crust is thicker on the farside (typically >km) than on
the nearside (generally <km) (Wieczorek and Phillips 1998). The Moon’s center of mass is
displaced ∼.km from its center of figure in the direction of the Earth.
Lunar rock and soil samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions revealed that albedo
(brightness) differences between the highlands and maria result from variations in compo-
sition. The dark maria are volcanic lava flows composed of basalt. Mare basalts often are
subdivided into three groups based on titanium concentrations: high-titanium, low-titanium,
and very-low-titanium. Titanium concentrations can reach up to 15% in the high-titanium
basalts, leading to speculation about the economic value of eventually mining these deposits.
The bright highlands are primarily composed of ferroan anorthosite, a plagioclase-rich rock
with minor mafic (iron and magnesium) components. The highlands display strong uniformity
in composition (SELENE observations report plagioclase concentrations near 100% (Ohtake
et al. 2009)), suggesting this portion of the crust formed from cooling of a single well-mixed

magmatic reservoir. In addition to anorthosite, the lunar highlands also show localized out-
crops of magnesium-rich rocks and KREEP rocks. KREEP rocks have high concentrations of
potassium (K), the rare-earth elements (REE), and phosphorous (P).
Mineralogical information from lunar rock analysis provides insights into the Moon’s for-
mation and early history. Early models for the Moon’s formation included co-accretion with
Earth from the solar nebula, formation elsewhere in the solar system and subsequent capture
by Earth’s gravity, and fission of the Moon from an early rapidly rotating Earth. Analysis of lunar
samples returned by Apollo and Luna revealed that the Moon is very similar in overall compo-
sition to Earth except for a lower percentage of iron and volatile elements. Lunar and terrestrial
rocks have identical oxygen isotope ratios, indicating both bodies formed in the same region
of space out of the same reservoir of material. Geochemical analysis combined with dynamical
models revealed major problems with all three existing formation models, leading scientists to
propose a new model of lunar formation through a giant impact (Hartmann et al. 1986). The
giant impact model proposes that Earth formed alone out of the solar nebula and underwent
differentiation within a few million years. Following differentiation, Earth collided with a plan-
etismal about half its size. The collision was off-center, resulting in terrestrial crust and mantle
material being ejected along with destroyed remnants of the impacting planetismal (Canup and
Esposito 1996). Ejected material formed a ring ofdebris around Earth which eventuallyaccreted
into the Moon. This model explains the similar compositions between Earth and Moon since
the Moon is largely derived from Earth’s crust and mantle. Most of Earth’s iron is located in the
core, which was not included in the ejected material, hence the Moon ended up with a lower

tine mission. The farside highlands are 6 km or higher in elevation, perhaps in part due to ejecta

concentration of iron because only the impacting planetismal contributed iron to the material
forming the Moon. The volatile-poor nature of lunar rocks is a result of impacts being energetic
events which easily vaporize volatile elements.The Moon thus accreted from terrestrial-derived
crust and mantle material which was depleted in iron and volatile elements.
Accretion and the decay of radioactive elements provided enough heat to melt at least the
outer portion of the Moon. The compositional variation of the present-day lunar crust can be
explained by this magma ocean stage. The outer ∼500 km of the Moon was partially to com-
pletely molten, allowing differentiation to occur. Higher density basalt sunk to the base of the
ocean while lower density plagioclase floated to the top. The plagioclase-rich reservoir was
at least 100 km thick and well-mixed, whereas the basalt formed isolated pods which under-
went subsequent fractional crystallization to alter the magma compositions. The uppermost
part of the plagioclase reservoir solidified, forming the homogenous anorthositic lunar high-
lands crust. Magnesium-rich and KREEP materials formed by localized eruptions/intrusions
from magma lying between the anorthositic crust and basaltic reservoirs. Large impact basins
forming during the LHB excavated and fractured the crust deeply enough to allow the basaltic
magmas access to the surface.
Observations by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on Chandrayaan-1 recently
have revealed the presence of hydroxyl (OH) and HO in the lunar regolith, with highest
concentrations near the poles and around some fresh impact craters (Pieters et al. 2009)
(> Fig. 3-79). The OH/HO is detected as an absorption line near 3-µm wavelength and
is indicative of water and hydroxyl adsorbed by other minerals. The OH/HO likely origi-
nates through implantation of oxygen and hydrogen from the solar wind, although delivery
by cometary impacts also may contribute. These findings do not contradict Apollo and Luna

sample results that the Moon is largely anhydrous because the OH/HO adsorptions are only
a surficial process occurring in lunar regolith and are not representative of the bulk lunar
composition.
The Moon, like Mercury, retains only a thin exosphere of particles derived from solar wind
capture and surface sputtering. Lack of any aeolian, fluvial, or glacial landforms indicates that
the Moon has never possessed an extensive atmosphere. However, like Mercury, radar obser-
vations suggest that ice deposits have accumulated in the floors of high-latitude impact craters
whose floors are in permanent shadow. Lunar Prospector’s neutron spectrometer revealed sig-
nificant declines in epithermal and fast neutron fluxes near the polar regions, consistent with
the presence of HO ice in these regions (> Fig. 3-80). Direct evidence of HO deposits on
floors of polar craters was provided by the LCROSS impact into Cabeus crater (> Fig. 3-81).
Spectroscopic analysis of the plume produced by the impact revealed the presence of HO and
OH at concentrations of about ten parts per million.

Impact craters are the dominant geologic landform on the Moon, ranging from tiny
(micrometeorite) pits on lunar rocks to multi-ring basins thousands of kilometers in diameter.
The volcanic versus impact origin of lunar craters was the source of considerable debate until
return of lunar samples led to widespread acceptance of the impact origin of these features.

Orientale Basin, Moon. Lunar Orbiter 4 obtained this image of the Orientale Basin, located along
the nearside-farside border. Orientale is an excellent example of a multi-ring impact basin, formed
when the impact excavates through most of the body’s lithosphere (NASA)
The transition from simple bowl-shaped craters to complex craters occurs near a diameter
of 17 km, but larger craters display peak-ring and multi-ring morphologies. Multi-ring basins
(>Fig. 3-82) occur when an impact excavates through most or all of the lithosphere, setting up
localized convection in the asthenosphere which fractures the lithosphere to produce the ring
structure (Melosh and McKinnon 1978). The number of rings decreases as lithospheric strength
increases, thus providing insights into the lithospheric thickness at the time of impact. Most
of the large lunar basins are multi-ring structures, although few are obvious on the nearside
because of postimpact intrusion by mare lava flows.
Crater density analysis indicates that the maria are younger than the highlands. The abil-
ity to radiometrically date lunar samples combined with knowledge of their original location
on the lunar surface has allowed scientists to relate crater density to surface unit formation
age. The resulting Lunar Crater Chronology allows determination of a lunar surface unit’s age
based entirely on its crater density. The combination of radiometric ages for actual samples and
crater density-derived ages suggest that the lunar highlands date to ∼4.0–4.2 Ga and the maria
mainly formed between 3.0 and 3.5 Ga, although localized lava flows may have continued up
to 2.0 Ga. The Lunar Crater Chronology has been extrapolated to other solar system bodies to
estimate absolute surface ages on those worlds and is the basis for non-terrestrial surface ages
cited throughout this chapter.

Hadley Rille, Moon. Sinuous rilles are common in the lunar mare and were formed by low-viscosity
lava ﬂows. This image shows the Apollo 15 landing site adjacent to Hadley Rille. The nearby
mountains are the Apennine Mountains which form part of the Imbrium Basin’s rim (NASA/LPI)
Lunar volcanism was concentrated in the maria and primarily consisted of low-viscosity
magmas with high eruption rates. These characteristics produced flood basalts that comprise
the maria regions. Small, low-sloped domes are the only volcanic edifices identified on the
Moon, but lava channels (sinuous rilles; >Fig. 3-83) and collapse pits suggesting underground
lava tunnels are common. Superposition relationships indicate that the mare deposits were
emplaced through a series of eruptions spaced over the ∼1 Ga of time during which volcan-
ism was occurring. Individual flows can be less than 50 m thick, but the superposition of these
flows results in mare deposits having total thickness of 100s to 1,000s of meters.
One surprising result from first images of the lunar farside was that the maria are not evenly
distributed across the Moon’s surface (>Fig. 3-84). Maria constitute about 30% of the nearside
surface area but only about 2% of the farside area. The approximately circular shape and lower
topography of the maria revealed that they are lava flows concentrated in the floors of large
impact basins. The concentration of maria on the lunar nearside is not because of an asymmet-
ric distribution of large impact basins (the distribution of basins is statistically identical on the
nearside versus farside), but rather can be attributed to the thinner nearside crust. Large pro-
jectiles excavate to greater depths than smaller projectiles and the large basins would excavate
to depths comparable to the thickness of the nearside crust. This would allow basaltic magma
retained in reservoirs near the base of the original anorthositic lunar crust to ascend to the
floor of the basin via impact-induced fractures, producing the mare flood basalts. The farside
crust is thick enough that basin excavation is insufficient to reach the deeper magma reservoirs,
reducing the amount of mare fill in farside basins.

Lunar Albedo. Albedo maps derived from Clementine data reveal the diﬀerence in dark maria dis-
tribution between the lunar nearside and farside. Approximately 30% of the nearside is covered by
maria but only the dark lava ﬂows cover only ∼2% of the farside (NASA)
Although low-viscosity volcanism dominates on the Moon, localized regions of more explo-
sive activity have been identified. Apollo 17 astronauts returned samples of orange soil from
dark-haloed Shorty crater. Orange and black glass in this sample was formed by a gas-rich
eruption at ∼3.6–3.7 Ga. This deposit was exposed much later by the impact which created
Shorty crater. Multispectral mapping of the lunar surface by Clementine revealed additional
sites covered by pyroclastic glasses, such as the Aristarchus region (McEwen et al. 1994). How-
ever, explosive volcanism is very limited in extent across the Moon and can be explained by
eruption of gas-rich lavas from localized magma reservoirs.
The Moon primarily exhibits localized tectonic landforms, although recent Lunar Recon-
naissance Orbiter images suggest it may have undergone global compression of ∼0.9 km. Most
tectonic features are associatedwith the maria, which often displayextensional graben along the
edges and compressional wrinkle ridges toward their centers (> Fig. 3-85). Both of these tec-
tonic features can be attributed to infilling of impact basins by mare flood basalts. The impact
basins formed millions of years before the volcanic eruptions producing the maria, giving the
basins time to isostatically adjust to a stable state. Addition of high-density basaltic lava flows
caused the basin floor to sag under the increased weight, causing extensional stresses along the
edges as these regions pulled awayfrom the basin rim and compressional stresses near the basin
center where downward-directed forces merged to produce thrust faults. These stresses and the
production of their resulting landforms continued until the mare-filled basins reached a new
isostatically stable configuration.

Summary
Surfaces and interiors of the four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and
Earth’s Moon display a number of similarities which indicate common evolutionary paths but
also a number of differences which make each body unique. All five bodies accreted from
smaller debris and underwent differentiation to produce a core, mantle, and crust. All have
likely had dynamos producing magnetic fields at some time in their histories, but only Earth
and Mercury have active dynamos today. Geologic histories of each body have been shaped by
impact cratering, volcanism, tectonic activity, and mass wasting processes. However, aeolian
processes have only affected the three bodies with a substantial atmosphere (Venus, Earth, and
Mars) and fluvial/glacial activity has been restricted to Earth and Mars. Large impacts early in
their histories can explain the large size of Mercury’s core, the slow retrograde rotation of Venus,
the presence of Earth’s Moon, and the hemispheric dichotomy on Mars. Earth and Venus are
large enough that they retain enough internal heat to drive active volcanism and tectonism at
the present time, but the two bodies lose heat by very different processes. Earth’s volcanic and
tectonic activity is dominated by horizontal movement of lithospheric plates whereas Venus’
volcanism and tectonism results from vertical motion produced by mantle upwelling and hot
spot volcanism. Mars is about half the size of Earth and Venus, and the level of its volcanic activ-
ity has declined through time, becoming concentrated in the Tharsis and Elysium regions at the
present time. Martian landforms have been heavily affected by fluvial and glacial activity both

in the distant past when the planet had a thicker atmosphere and in more recent times as obliq-
uity variations produce dramatic examples of climate change. Volcanic activity has declined on
Mercury since its formation and may no longer occur, but the planet displays a unique tectonic
regime of global contraction as its large iron core gradually solidifies and shrinks. The Moon is
a geologically dead world, where volcanism ceased about 2 Ga ago, but the recent discovery of
adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen combined with confirmation of HO ice in polar craters have
reignited interest in our closest celestial neighbor and the resources it may contain for future
human exploration and settlement. Continued exploration of the surfaces and interiors of the
worlds constituting the inner solar system will not only provide a better understanding of our
own Earth but also will give humans the knowledge to make us better caretakers of our home
planet.

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors
Abstract:
The interiors of the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and
Neptune) are discussed. Emphasis is on the basic physical principles rather than the details
of specific models. This article covers the nature and properties of the materials that comprise
these planets and the basic principles of their behavior at high temperature and pressure, lead-
ing to the predominance of metallic hydrogen in the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn but no
first order phase transition between molecular and metallic states. The consequences of hydro-
static equilibrium are assessed,and the resulting dependenceof radius on mass and dependence
of internal temperature on pressure are described. Thermal evolution of planets is described
through a complete explanation of the consequences of the virial theorem, and from this, cool-
ing times for these planets are estimated, leading to the implication that Jupiter is primarily
cooling throughout whereas Saturn depends in part on an additional energy source (helium
rainout) while Uranus and Neptune are storing part of their energy of formation. The method
for using gravity data to constrain models, in particular moments of inertia, is outlined but not
developed in detail. A summary is provided of current interior modeling and how it relates to
the observed magnetic fields. The general discussion also allows an appreciation of the nature
of the many giant exoplanets being found, but these bodies are not explicitly described.
1
Introduction
Planets are diverse. Within our solar system, the four “major” planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune) have some superficial similarities: They all have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres,
large radii and low densities, magnetic fields, and satellite and ring systems. It makes some
sense to discuss them as a group. They are nonetheless different in important ways. My goal
here is to explain the main principles that apply to these bodies as a group but also convey the
ways in which they express their individuality. Uranus and Neptune still appear to be similar
because our vision is still blurred (dedicated missions not having taken place yet), but previous
experience suggests that we should not be surprised if important differences exist. The explosion
of exoplanet discoveries tells us that these kinds of planets are very common in the universe.
Why should one care what is deep inside a planet? First, knowledge of the interior structure
of a planet provides the basis for explaining many phenomena that arise within but manifest
themselves externally. One can not understand why some planets have magnetic fields (and
others do not) and why Jupiter emits as much heat as it does without an understanding of the
insides of these bodies. Second, this knowledge provides an essential part of the understanding
of external phenomena and processes that are indirectly linked to the interior. For example, one
cannot claim to understand why Jupiter’s atmosphere is depleted in light noble gases (helium
and neon) except by appealing to internal processes. Third, it provides a unifying framework.
If one wants to build a story of how the planet formed and evolved to the present state, this
will depend in large part on understanding the interior. Fourth, it provides a testing ground for
fundamental physics – theory and experiment – under “extreme” conditions. For example, the
most common metal in the universe is probably metallic hydrogen. This material is of funda-
mental interest to condensed matter physicists. It also happens to dominate the mass of Jupiter.
It is not yet well understood, either theoretically or experimentally. This last reason may be of
less interest to planetary scientists, but it is of much interest to condensed matter physicists.
The goal in this chapter will be to identify and explain the main ideas. This is not in the
form of a conventional review paper because it goes back to fundamentals and relies to some

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors 4

extent on toy models. It should thus be complementary to review papers such as Guillot (2005)
or Fortney and Nettelmann (2010) and be suitable as a basis for teaching. Readers seeking the
details of models or the input data should seek these in the review papers; they are merely
summarized here. A reader seeking an understanding of basic assumptions and their limitations
or an elementary exposition of the fundamentals can find them here.
If one wants to construct a model of a planet, then the most obvious requirement is that it
agrees with observations and be consistent with the cosmic environment in which it formed. It is
expected that the body will be close to hydrostatic equilibrium almost everywhere. However,
observables and basic physics are never sufficient to remove ambiguities, especially since we do
not have reliable seismology for these bodies. The model constructed also needs to be consis-
tent with the age of the body. There is a great deal of uncertainty about how planets form, but
there are some general principles about how they cool after forming, and these constrain likely
thermal structures. Planetary models thus rest on four foundations: cosmic abundances, plan-
etary observations, material properties (at both high and low pressure), and (to a lesser extent)
transport properties, especially our ideas of convection. The deep interiors of these planets have
material properties unlike those of everyday experience. If the atmosphere is defined to be that
part where sunlight is scattered or absorbed or where IR outgoing radiation is emitted, then
this is a negligible part of the planet mass, but it plays the role as a boundary condition on the
interior and so its material and transport properties matter. The text is structured to explain
each of these requirements and ideas for satisfactory models.
2
What Are These Planets Made Of?
The best way to answer this question is to “ask the planet,” which means deducing planetary
composition from its observed properties. In the special case of Jupiter, we shall find that
the planet is mostly hydrogen. This is unambiguous because hydrogen is an end-member:
There is nothing less dense. However, most planets have ambiguous compositions. This is espe-
cially true of the so-called ice giants (Uranus and Neptune), but even true of the planet we
know best: Earth. To make the argument that Earth’s core is mostly iron, one must appeal,
at least in part, to cosmochemical arguments like “What is abundant as a planet forming
material?” These arguments are necessarily plausible rather than rigorous, but they still make
a strong case due to the large differences in cosmic abundance among materials of similar
chemistry.
Cosmic abundances of elements are determined by nuclear physics. Hydrogen overwhelm-
ingly dominates because it is an elementary particle; helium is also abundant because it is stable
and can be formed in the Big Bang era. Heavier elements (what astronomers call “metals”) are
formed in stars and then ejected into the interstellar medium, where the material then becomes
available to form solar systems. Combinations of alpha particles, multiples of 4 mass units with
proton number equal to neutron number, are very favorable at low mass; oxygen, formed by
combining four alphas, is especially favorable because of its nuclear shell structure. So oxygen
is the next most abundant element followed closely by carbon. Neon (five alphas) and nitrogen
(not a combination of alphas) follow somewhat behind. It is more complicated as one goes to
larger masses, but magnesium, silicon, and iron are particularly favored by nuclear physics. Iron
is the “endpoint” of equilibrium nucleosynthesis in the sense that all more massive nuclei are
less stable.

Cosmic abundances can be estimated by observations of the interstellar medium and other
stars. However, they are not spatially uniform because of differences in stellar activity from
place to place. These abundances are continuously evolving in response to both ongoing ther-
monuclear synthesis and the recycling of material back into the interstellar medium as a star
dies; since both of these processes occur at different rates depending on the local environment,
abundances themselves evolve in both space and time. This means that planets forming around
other stars could have significantly different properties, even though the fundamental classes
of materials (discussed below) are surely universal.
Solar system abundances are determined from the solar photosphere and correlate well with
the relative abundances measured in meteorites, except for the most volatile elements. Accord-
ingly, the ratio of hydrogen to silicon is enormously different in the Sun from the value in a
meteorite or in Earth, but the ratio of Ca to Al, say, is very similar between the Sun and a mete-
orite. This comparison is not easytodoat high precision, and determination ofsolarabundances
from spectroscopy is not straightforward (and still debated for some important ratios, e.g., C/O,
Ne/H). A useful summary of abundance and other data can be found in Lodders and Fegley
(1998).
Here is a summary list, useful for understanding the most abundant elements (>Table 4-1).

What Kinds of Materials Exist in Planets?
Of course, elemental abundances do not tell all one wants to know; one also needs to know the
chemical form that the materials take. The abundances of elements are determined by nuclear
physics. However, most elements are not stable in elemental form but are found as molecules or
in compounds. Additionally, it is important to understand the difference between the chemistry
of matter and its phase. Chemistry speaks only about the elements that make up the matter

(think of the chemical formula). Phase, on the other hand, refers to the physical properties
of the matter. For example, water has the chemistry of HO but has three different accessible
phases on the Earth’s surface: vapor, liquid, and ice. In fact, water has many high-pressure ice
phases, which are all unique in their crystal structure. At sufficiently high pressure, water will be
a metal. The ways in which the atoms are bonded together into a solid network differ between
different solid phases. The phase of matter depends on the conditions of the environment, most
importantly the temperature and pressure. The properties of planet-forming materials are the
subject of physical chemistry and condensed matter physics. The cosmically most abundant
materials can be divided into three general groups:
1. “Gases”: those that do not condense (i.e., form solids or liquids) under conditions plausibly
reached in the medium from which planets form
2. “Ices”: those that form volatile compounds and condense but only at low temperatures
(usually beyond the asteroid belt)
3. “Rocks”: those that condense at high temperatures and provide the building blocks for the
terrestrial planets
It is important to understand that these are labels of convenience; nothing is ever so simple that
one could so easily subdivide materials. The quotation marks are there to remind the reader that
what one calls an ice is sometimes in the gas or liquid phase, etc. But the subdivision proves
useful nonetheless because of the large differences in behavior and abundances among these
groups. Remarkably, there is considerable correspondence between abundances and classes of
materials even though they involve completely unrelated physics: Generally speaking, the gases
are most abundant, the ices are next most abundant, and the “rock” is least abundant (though
not by much).
The “gases” are hydrogen, helium, and (to a much lesser extent) the heavier noble gases. The
gases overwhelmingly dominate the “observable,” (i.e., baryonic part of the) universe, the Sun,
and giant planets such as Jupiter.
The hydrogen molecule His the low-pressure thermodynamic ground state of H and it
interacts with other hydrogen molecules and with helium by a van der Waals interaction, which
is a very weak attractive force except when the molecules are pushed close together – this is why
condensation of hydrogen requires very low temperatures. It is also why it is easy to squeeze
hydrogen (as a liquid, solid, or, of course, as a gas) until one approaches densities where the
distance between molecules is about the size of a molecule.
The “ices” are mostly hydrides of the next set of light elements: O, C, and N (e.g., HO water,
CHmethane, and NHammonia). But they also include other combinations among them-
selves (e.g., N, CO, CO, HCN). Hydrides do not necessarily dominate – they do not seem to in
the interstellar medium – but they are thermodynamically favored when the partial pressure of
hydrogen is high and will thus form if temperatureor pressure permits reactions to occur. Water
is the least volatile of this set because of hydrogen bonding between water molecules, which one
can think of loosely as a weak form of ionic bonding arising from the very nonuniform charge
distribution around the water molecule. Ammonia also has some hydrogen bonding. Methane
and molecular nitrogen rely on van der Waals bonding in the liquid and solid state. CO has a
small dipole moment but also interacts mostly by van der Waals forces.
“Rocks” include both metallic materials (iron and iron-nickel alloys) and as well as what
we might usually call rock (oxides and silicates). The latter both have strong ionic and covalent
bonding. Metallic bonding can be thought of as a special case of ionic bonding with electrons
providing a spatially distributed charge, rather than the discrete charges of an ionic material

such as NaCl. These materials are much more tightly bound than “gases” or “ices” and are
therefore stiffer and less volatile.
As one considers the material classifications in order of decreasing volatility,
“GAS′′ →“ICE′′ →“ROCK′′
low-pressure density increases, and material stiffness increases. The densities remain in this
order even at very high pressure (e.g., ice is always less dense than rock even though it is more
compressible). The parameter that describes stiffness is the adiabatic bulk modulus:
Ks = ρ (∂p
∂ρ )
s
where ρ is mass density, P is pressure, and S is entropy . Bulk modulus has units of pressure and
is a measure of the strength of interaction among the molecules in the material – soft (weakly
bound/volatile) materials compress easily, while tightly bound materials are stiff. It is also a
guide as to how much density change might arise in a planet due to internal pressure.
Δρ/ρ ∼p/K
Thus, the fractional change in density between surface and deep interior is roughly the pressure
in the deep interior divided by the bulk modulus. This assumes negligible surface pressure and
that P ≲K. Therefore, if the interior pressure is comparable to the bulk modulus, then you
expect the density inside the planet to be considerably larger than at the surface. In the giant
planets, this increase in density occurs even in the interior well below the region that behaves
like an ideal gas.
To summarize (>Table 4-2):
The type of bonding refers to low-pressure behavior. However, everything becomes a metal
at high-enough pressure.
As an important first step to understanding the conditions inside planets, the pressure can
be estimated by assuming that the density is roughly constant. Obviously, this is only a very
rough guide, but it helps the reader appreciate what must be known about material properties.

For the Moon, this predicts about the true central pressure (not surprisingly because it is a small
body). For Earth, it predicts around 2 Megabars (the true value is about 3.6). For Uranus and
Neptune, it predicts similarvalues (because the lowermean densityis offset bythe largerradius).
For Jupiter, it predicts around 10 Megabars (the actual is 40 or more). This crude formula under
predicts the central pressure of differentiated bodies (which is to say, all planets), especially
when the core has a density much larger than the mean density.
If one wants to figure out what goes on in a planet, then the behavior of the materials
listed above at planetary pressures must be known. One approach is experiment. The experi-
mental techniques are of two kinds: shock waves and static compression. Shock waves generate
very high pressures for tiny fractions of a second by accelerating samples into a stationary tar-
get. Static compression is more ideal for studies of what happens in equilibrium, but attaining
extremely high pressures is more difficult. The highest static pressures are obtained by squeezing
tiny (∼tens of microns) samples between the tips of two diamonds in what are called diamond
anvil cells (remember that pressure is force over area). But experimental data alone are not
enough for two reasons: (1) Experiments do not usually get to the full range of conditions
encountered in planets. For example, pressures deep within Jupiter are unattainable by con-
ventional techniques. (2) Even when experiments reach relevant conditions, they seldom map
out enough of the thermodynamic phase space – T, P, and composition – to be sufficient for
planetary modeling, where one needs a fine grid of parameter values. So it helps greatly to have
a theoretical framework to incorporate experimental results and to extrapolate and interpolate.
Many of these frameworks seek to find one of the most basic and important properties of a
material, which is its equation of state. This relates how the density of a material depends on the
environmental conditions; strictly, this includes both pressure and temperature, but in many
cases, the thermal effects can be safely neglected. The reason is that the electronic energies from
the interactions at high pressure much exceed thermal energies. Typical electronic energies are
many electron volts, whereas the thermal energy per ion of molecule is of order kBT where kB
is Boltzmann’s constant, and this equals 1 eV at 12,000 K.
It is a good idea to get some physical understanding of why materials resist compression,
and one way to do this is to construct a theory that works at very high pressures. This turns out
to be an excellent approximation for the deep interior of Jupiter, as well as being pedagogically
valuable. Consider, first, the energy of an electron that is confined to a sphere of radius r. By the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, it has a momentum ∼ħ/r, and therefore an energy ∼(ħ/r)/2 m
where m is the electron mass and tv is planck’s constant divided be 2π. Notice that since den-
sity scales as 1/r, this means the energy scales as ρ/. Since Coulomb energies scale as 1/r,

202 4
Gas and Ice Giant Interiors
it follows that the kinetic energy implied by quantum mechanics always win at sufficiently high
density and pressure. At very high pressures, the electrons will form a Fermi gas, and the typi-
cal momentum of an electron will be ∼ħ/r even though the electrons are not spatially localized
but form a degenerate “sea.” This arises because of the Pauli exclusion principle, which limits
each quantum state occupancy to just two electrons (corresponding to the two-spin states). The
resulting energy per electron thus scales as ρ/, and the resulting pressure (minus the deriva-
tive of this energy with respect to volume) scales as ρ/. This is called the Fermi pressure, and it
is the asymptotic (that is to say, extreme high pressure) limit of all nonrelativistic materials. Of
course, the electrons are nonuniformly distributed in planets and the materials need not even
be metals, but even so, this kind of equation of state forms a guide for what to expect.
In Jupiter, this limit is approached but not reached. To see this, consider the density one
would obtain if one simply filled space with spheres, each of which had the mass and first
Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom. Neglecting interstitial space (i.e., squashing the atoms into
dodecahedra of the same volume as the spheres), this would yield
ρ =
mp

πao
∼.g/cc
(4.5)
where mp is the proton mass, and ao is the first Bohr radius (about 0.53 Å). The mean density of
Jupiter is only 1.33 g/cc, but a substantial part of the interior is at densities exceeding this value.
In the hydrogen atom, there is balance between Coulomb and the kinetic energy required by the
uncertainty principle. As a consequence, the actual behavior of hydrogen deep within Jupiter
has not reached the Fermi gas limit. Still, it is beginning to approach the limit in which the
density is determined by the electron density. Since hydrogen uniquely has only one heavy par-
ticle (the proton) per electron, whereas all other materials have two or more heavy particles
per electron, it turns out that hydrogen is distinctly less dense than any other material at any
pressure, usually by more than a factor of 2. This is what enables us to be so confident about
the mean composition of Jupiter. However, there remains one more step in the logic: Can we
be sure that temperature does not reduce the density significantly? That is, could we imagine a
Jupiter made of mostly helium (say) but very hot? To answer this, it is necessary to appreciate the
typical electronic energies within planets. In the case above of hydrogen atoms stuffed together,
the energy of the electrons is of order 10 eV (the binding energy of the hydrogen atom). To dis-
turb the energy and significantly change the density, one would have to heat the material to
∼(10 eV)/kB ∼100,000 K. Aside from the likely lack of a means of heating to that level, the prob-
lem with such a high T is that the body would then be wildly unstable to convection. Imagine
displacing upward a blob of material at such a high T. It will rise and expand adiabatically and
thus find itself surrounded by material more dense than itself. It therefore accelerates upward,
at high velocity carrying its excess heat outward and relaxing back toward an isentropic state.
The story is actually somewhat more complicated than this since there may be compositional
gradients (see, e.g., Leconte and Chabrier 2012), and one must also consider the limited amount
of energy available in formation. But the conclusion is that planets are close to being degenerate,
that is, their thermodynamic properties are dominated by the electrons and not by the thermal
motions. Indeed, this is the central difference between planets and main sequence stars. Planets
can be compared to white dwarf stars, which have a mass similar to our Sun but a radius similar
to Earth.
It is useful to think about the behavior of a planet that has an equation of state of poly-
tropic form. Astrophysicists write such an equation in the form P∝ρ+/n where n is the

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors 4
203
polytropic index. We shall here adopt for convenience the form P∝ρn. This will have rele-
vance for materials that expand without limit as P→0 or bodies that are so massive that the
mean density is much larger than the zero pressure density. Since the central pressure accord-
ing to hydrostatic equilibrium must scale as <ρ>gR ∼(M/R)(GM/R)R ∼GM/Rand the
density scales as M/R, we immediately have
M
R∝[ M
R]
n
⇒R ∝M
−n
−n
(4.6)
Notice four things:
1. In the limit n→∞, the result R ∝M/is recovered; this makes sense since that limit is
incompressible material (infinitesimal density change gives large pressure change).
2. When n = /, R ∝M−/. Recall that this is the case for an ideal Fermi gas. It is therefore
applicable to super-Jupiters, brown dwarfs, and white dwarfs. At sufficiently high mass (but
still nonrelativistic), it applies to all materials irrespective of atomic mass. At sufficiently
high mass, all degenerate bodies become smaller as mass is added to them. It should be noted,
however, that bodies more massive than Jupiter are also hotter; more precisely, they usually
have higher entropy. This means that the thermal effects become increasingly important.
For this reason, bodies of ten or so Jupiter masses are often slightly bigger than Jupiter itself.
3. R is independent of mass when n = ; this is approximately relevant to Jupiter and Saturn.
4. For n = (crudely relevant for Superearths and parts of Uranus and Neptune) R ∝
M/. There is a large literature on polytropes; the reader can find out all about them in
Chandrasekhar (1939).
In general, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium does not have an analytical solution, but
n = is a special case since it leads to a linear differential equation. Let us derive this, since it is
of practical use. We assume P = Kρ:

This can be conveniently be written as a standard differential equation

Thus, an explicit formula for the radius is derived, and it is independent of mass, as promised.
For the realistic choice of K = .× cgs units (which approximates a cosmic hydro-
gen/helium mixture), this formula gives a radius of 70,300 km. The mean radius of Jupiter is
69,800 km. We can also compute the mean density in terms of the central density:

(4.12)
The inferred central density is π/3 times the mean density, corresponding to 4.38 g/cc and
a pressure of 40 Megabars for Jupiter. The radius thus obtained should apply equally well to
Saturn, but the observed radius of Saturn is only ∼58,000 km. The fact that Saturn is smaller
than Jupiter must be because it has heavier constituents, not because it has lower mass. Detailed
models confirm this elementary observation.
A common way of estimating the effect of a uniform admixture of heavier elements is to
assumevolume additivity. This is typically accurate to about a percent or two, sufficiently precise
for the purpose here. If the mass fraction of “heavies” is y then one obtains

ρ(P) = −y
√
P/K
+

ρ heavy
(4.13)
where ρ(P) is the density at pressure P; the LHS is just the specific volume, and the RHS
terms represent the specific volumes of the hydrogen–helium mixture and the heavy com-
ponent respectively. In the limit where the heavy component is very much more dense than
the hydrogen–helium mix and y is not too large, this equation is simply P = Keff ρwhere
Keff = K(−y). This is still of the right functional form for application of the derived solution,
and the radius is accordingly reduced by −y. Saturn would require that y ∼., implying ∼15
Earth masses of heavier stuff. The same amount of heavy stuff in Jupiter is a smaller fraction
of the total mass (yJupiter ∼.) and permitted by the observed radius! Detailed models allow
this, though the uncertainties remain large. The presence of a core (as distinct from just heavy
element enrichment) is unresolved, though likely, especially for Saturn. Determination of the
presence of a core cannot be done from radius alone; it requires careful consideration of the
gravitational moments (discussed below).
The above solution can still be used in the region external to a core, but A is no longer the
central density, and B is no longer zero. The coefficient B is then determined by making sure
that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is correctly satisfied at the core surface (i.e., one
must allow for the gravitational acceleration of the core). The relative magnitudes of A and B
then determine the shift in the radius R. This exercise can be carried through to show that the
effect of a core is roughly the same as the effect of a uniform enrichment of heavy elements. A
Jupiter-like planet will have the same radius (for a given mass) irrespective of whether the heavy
elements within it are in a core or uniformly mixed!
In the simple discussion provided here, a detailed description of the current state of theory
and experiments has been avoided; more details on this can be found in Guillot (2005) and in
French et al. (2012). In respect of hydrogen, it is now generally agreed that at the temperatures
of interest, there is no first order phase transition between the low-pressure molecular form
and the high-pressure metallic (monatomic) form. Instead, there is a gradual breakdown of the
molecules and populating of a conduction band, much as in a semiconductor where the band
gap decreases and then vanishes with increasing pressure. The “transition” occurs at around
1 Megabar, out at 0.8–0.9 of Jupiter’s radius and at ∼0.6 of Saturn’s radius. It probably does not

Radius vs. mass for gas giants and ice giants, both in Jupiter units. The gas giants are assumed
to have a Jupiter-like internal entropy. This is the reason why the radius does not decrease with
decreasing mass. The ice/rock curve assumes 50% ice and 50% rock by mass. There is also an
ice/rock + 20% hydrogen/helium by mass similar to Uranus and Neptune. The positions of the
planets are indicated
occur in Uranus and Neptune because the material at that pressure is not predominantly hydro-
gen. The helium component does not significantly metalize (i.e., it does not contribute to the
electron gas even at the higher pressures encountered in Jupiter). The interaction between the
helium atoms and the Fermi gas is repulsive, leading to the possibility of limited solubility of
helium, just as all noble gases tend to be insoluble in metals (and oil is insoluble in water). In
Uranus and Neptune, a combination of theory and experiment constrains the behavior of rock
and ice components. However, their interpretation is ambiguous: A mixture of gas and rock can
have similar density and bulk modulus as ice.
In >Fig. 4-1, one sees that hydrogen–helium adiabatic bodies have roughly constant radius
(as promised) but actually expanding as they approach low-mass ideal gas adiabatic behavior
(P ∝ρ.for a cosmic H–He mixture). The radius actually declines as one goes to still higher
masses (the brown dwarf regime) though the effect is modest if (as is usually the case) these
bodies are also hotter and thus less close to the degenerate limit. This figure assumes isentropic
bodies, and we turn now to the basis for that assumption. This figure also shows us that Uranus
and Neptune do not have a simple interpretation.

What Are the Temperatures in Planets?
The temperature inside a planet is determined by the heat flow from the interior. In the giant
planets, this heat flow is sufficiently large that it can be observed as excess luminosity. The
observed values are shown in >Table 4-3.

(Earth is included for purposes of comparison). Knowledge of plausible planetary materials
can be used to pose the following question: What would the thermal state be inside a planet, were
the heat to be carried by microscopic (i.e., conductive or radiative) processes alone?
First, consider the deep atmosphere. These bodies are dominated by molecular hydrogen
atmospheres, which also usually provides the dominant opacity source through pressure-
induced absorption. The property of pressure-induced absorption is that the opacity is pro-
portional to pressure. Now the heat flux carried by radiation can be written in the form
Frad ∼d(σT)/dτ
(4.14)
where the increment in optical depth is
dτ = −ρκdr
(4.15)
and κ is the opacity. (This equation should be intuitively obvious to order of magnitude since the
photons go one optical depth before being absorbed.) Optical depth is dimensionless and here
defined to decrease as one goes outward, so an optical depth of one corresponds to the place
from which photons escape to space. This predicts that if radiative transport dominates, then
T∝τ . However, T = Te (the effective temperature) at τ = , by definition, whence T ∼Teτ/.
From hydrostatic equilibrium, dP/dr = −g. Dividing by ( > 4.15) gives
dP/dτ = g/κ
(4.16)
But in molecular hydrogen, the opacity is roughly proportional to pressure
κmol H ∝P
(4.17)
because it is the result of pressure induced opacity. (Hydrogen molecules have no dipole
moment.) Integrating ( > 4.16),
p ∝τ/
(4.18)
and constancy of Frad (T∝τ) then implies T ∝p/. This is a stronger dependence than
the increase of temperature along an adiabat. In a cosmic H–He mixture, T ∼p.along an
adiabat. Radiative transport in molecular hydrogen would therefore require that the entropy
decrease with height. This leads to a convective instability. This argument could break down
around T ∼,K where molecular hydrogen becomes somewhat transparent. The opacity

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors 4
207
does not just depend on pressure, it also depends on the wavelengths of the thermal photons
involved or equivalently on temperature. Guillot (2005) has studied this in detail and finds that
there are minor constituents, for example, alkali metals, that will provide sufficient opacity to
guarantee that the heat flow will be carried by radiation.
Deep within the planet, the highest thermal conductivity you can find is that attributable to
metallic hydrogen. This is certainly less than 10erg/cm.s.K (see French et al. 2012). Even for
this upper bound, the observed heat flow would lead to a temperature gradient of 0.3 K/km,
implying a temperature increase of around 20,000 K for a radial range of 60,000 km. As we
shall see, this is convectively unstable. The situation in dense (insulating or semiconducting)
molecular hydrogen is much worse …a thermal conductivity of perhaps 10erg/cm.s.K and a
conductive gradient of around 30 K/km, implying ridiculous temperature increase with depth,
were the heat flow carried conductively.
In all planets, and in giant gas and ice planets in particular, the conductive profiles are usu-
ally convectively unstable (at least if the material is not too viscous). This leads to the adiabatic
hypothesis. The planet convects, and because it is a fluid, it resides very close to the isentrope
(often referred to as the adiabat). Of course, this assumes that the body is chemically homoge-
nous or is in discreet layers. But which adiabat? The answer lies in the atmosphere; the place
where heat can finally escape to space. The specific entropy at optical depth unity is the specific
entropy in the very deepest parts of the planet (assuming uniform composition). This is very dif-
ferent from terrestrial bodies where the choice of adiabat is dictated by the rheological law (i.e.,
how hot must the mantle be before the material can flow so as to eliminate the heat?).
It follows from the adiabatic hypothesis that the temperatureswithin these planets are above
the melting curves of the major constituents. They are also supercritical, meaning that the adi-
abat never encounters a first-order phase transition. For example, hydrogen may have a first
order phase transition between molecular and metallic forms below a few thousand degrees,
but this is well below the actual temperature (see French et al. 2012). In > Fig. 4-2, we see
typical temperatures for these planets as a function of pressure, assuming adiabatic structures.

How Does One Explain the Heat Flows?
To answer this question, it is first useful to understand the virial theorem.
Hydrostatic equilibrium together with the first law of thermodynamics and other thermo-
dynamic relations can enable one to construct an evolution of a planet or star. However, there is
an extremely valuable result called the virial theorem that enables one to see some of the general
behavior of an evolving body. There is no new physics in this theorem, merely a clever use of the
existing physics. It assumes slow evolution relative to dynamical timescales, and in the current
application, this is the same as the hydrostatic assumption. The virial theorem also shows up in
other areas of physics (e.g., the expected velocity dispersion of a self-gravitating star cluster).
The gravitational energy of a planet can be written
EG = −∫

where we have chosen to use m (the mass inside radius r) as the independent variable. Thus, r
is the radius that contains mass m. But we also have the hydrostatic equation, which together

This last result is one of several ways of stating the virial theorem.
In the conventional discussion of stellar structure (not planets!), ideal gas formulas apply to
a good approximation. The pressure is then nkBT, where n is the number density of atoms or
molecules. Moreover, the thermal energycan be written in the form nkBT/γ where γ = Cp/Cv−
and is known as the Gruneisen parameter. (Warning: Some texts use γ to represent the ratio of
specific heats. Remember also that this formula is only correct for an ideal gas.) It follows that
Etotal = EG + Ethermal = (−
γ )∫
M

(4.23)
whence it follows immediatelythat provided γ > /, the total energy is negative. Atomic hydro-
gen has γ = /; molecular hydrogen has γ = /. Radiation dominated systems can approach

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors 4
209
γ = /, and the specialness of this limit is related to the undetermined character of a polytrope
when n = /and the resulting instability (collapse or explosion), as discussed at the beginning
of this chapter.
The following discussion is only for the usual case where γ > /. For a body in hydrostatic
equilibrium and supported by ideal gas pressure, the integral above increases as the temperature
goes up since P = nkT and the integral of ndV is constant. But this corresponds to a decrease in
total energy and therefore corresponds to contraction as heat is lost to space. In other words, a
star with no other energy sources has “negative specific heat”: As it loses energy by radiation to
space, it contracts and heats up internally. This was a major puzzle in the early work on stellar
evolution. In reality, the contraction and heating is truncated either by the introduction of a
new energy source: thermonuclear ignition (arrival at the main sequence) or the introduction
of a new pressure: the onset of degeneracy. Provided ideal gas dominates, T ∼GMμ/kBR, either
during slow contraction or on the main sequence. Here, T is the typical internal temperature,
and μ is the molecular weight (normally ∼proton mass for a main sequence star).
In a planet, one cannot use the virial theorem to determine temperature directly, but it can
still be used to set up equations for the thermal history, as explained below, and it leads to a very
different answer from stars.
It is most useful to consider a perturbation to the planet in which hydrostatic equilibrium
is preserved, but there are infinitesimal changes in density and pressure at each mass element.
In the following formulas, the reader should think of δ as labeling the change that comes about
because of some evolutionary change at that location. For example, δ(/r) means the change in
1/r that comes from the change in the radius that contains mass m. Thus,
δEG = −∫

However, the first term is zero just as it was previously, and dm = ρ.d(πr/), whence
δEG = ∫

(4.25)
So the change in gravitational energy equals the work done on the sample. (This interpretation
only works if you think about constant composition. Obviously one can also lower the energy
by moving the denser stuff to higher pressures and the less dense stuff to lower pressures, that
is, δ(/ρ) is negative where P is high and positive where P is low. The formula is always correct
but the interpretation of it depends on the circumstances.)
We can now use this result to derive a very important result for the energy output of planets.
The intrinsicluminosityLofa planet comes from explicit energysources (e.g., radioactive decay,
tidal heating), here labeled Q (per unit mass), but can also come from changes in internal and
gravitational energy. When we refer to “intrinsic” luminosity, we are excluding the (sometimes
dominant) energy arising from external sources, especially the absorbed sunlight. Thus,
L = ∫

Consider a planet that is not differentiating (i.e., not changing the distribution of constituents).
Now, planets are degeneratebodies, and we can thus conveniently subdivide the internal energy
and pressure into zero temperature pieces and finite temperature corrections in the form
Eint = E+ CVT
P = P+ γρCVT
P= −dE

where the expression for EG was derived above. But the first and third terms in the integral
cancel. The last term is small because we can estimate that d(/ρ)/dt = (α.dT/dt)/ρ, where α
is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and αT ≪, but can also be combined with the earlier
thermal term using the thermodynamic identity (Maxwell relation) Cp = CV(+ αγT). So we
finally get, to an excellent approximation,
L = ∫
M

[−CP dT
dt + Q] dm
(4.29)
(The extent to which this is approximate rather than exact is not straightforward to estimate
analytically. Numerical evaluation does however indicate that it is a very good approximation.)
What this result means is that as a planet cools and contracts, the gravitational energy
becomes more negative, and the dominant part of the internal energy (the part due to com-
pression) becomes more positive, but that these cancel! The consequence is that the dominant
energy output associated with the planet evolution (aside from radioactivity and external
sources of heating) is the change in the thermal energy at constant pressure. This seems intu-
itively obvious, but it is nonetheless widely misunderstood (e.g., there are books which say that
Jupiter’s energy output is derived from contraction when in fact the dominant effect is simply
cooling. Of course, cooling implies contraction, but the energy available is nonetheless thermal).
The result is sometimes stated with CV replacing CP, but this is often a minor point since
these differ typically by less than 10%, at least for Jupiter and Saturn (unlike “hot Jupiters” or
brown dwarfs). Very importantly, the result does not include gravitational energy release due
to compositional changes (e.g., core formation, differentiation in general). This can be imme-
diately recognized by noting that changes in density (determining changes in gravitational
energy) do not only come about from work done by pressure …they can also arise from moving
constituents around.
Let us now consider the various possible heat sources.
5.1 Radioactivity
By mass, the cosmic abundances of K, U, and Th are in the ratios 60,000:4:1. For those ratios,
(close to those actually observed in CI carbonaceous chondrites) the expected present-day heat
production of carbonaceous chondritic material is around 6 or 7 × 10−erg/g.sec. This comes
roughly one half from K and one quarter each from U and Th (for more reliable numbers
look at the various tables in Lodders and Fegley (1998)). The CI value for heat production looks
roughly like the Earth value of L/M in >Table 4-3 but that is a fallacy because Earth’s mantle

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors 4
211
is depleted in K by about an order of magnitude relative to CI. There is no reason to suppose
that Earth’s core contains such large amounts of potassium; the depletion is more reasonably
attributable to volatility. (Other elements of similar volatility to K are also depleted in Earth,
and there is no expectation that they would also go into the core.) Consequently, Earth’s energy
output is believed to be roughly a factor of 2 larger than that due to radioactivity alone. Moon’s
heat flow is too poorly determined to yield to any useful analysis. It may be anomalously high
in the places measured (or just very poorly measured).
Note two important things about radioactive heating: First, it scales as the mass of the planet
(which means that the surface heat flux will scale roughly as mass over area or, equivalently,
radius). So Mars should have a factor of two-lower heat flux than Earth (all else being equal,
which it isn’t!) Second, radioactive heat decays with time so the heat flow should be much larger
in the early history of the planet. For Earth, radioactive heating should be about four times
larger in early history (with K and U playing major roles).
Clearly, none of the heat flows measured in the outer solar system can be attributed
to radioactivity, especially when one considers that the mass of these bodies (except Io) is
dominated by material (H, He, C, N, O) that contains no radioactive elements.
Short-lived radioactive heating (Al, Fe) may also be important in setting up the initial
conditions for planet evolution and allowing even small bodies to melt and differentiate. The
half-lives of these elements are less than a million years. There is enough energy release from
the decay of Al to raise the temperature by ∼1,500 K (assuming no heat loss). Of course, it is
only available if a substantial-sized body forms very quickly after the initial collapse to form the
solar system.
5.2 Secular Cooling
Suppose a planet has cooled by an amount T over 4.5 billion years. If it has a mean-specific
heat CP, then the expected luminosity per unit mass, L/M, is obviously CPT/(.× years)
which is
L/M = (× −erg/g.sec).(CP/× cgs).(T/K)
(4.30)
For Earth, this will be significant, or even dominant for cooling rates of ∼200 K/billion years.
For Jupiter and Saturn where the specific heat is ∼2 × 10cgs (because of the low molecular
weight), the observed luminosity can be explained for total cooling of a few thousand degrees
(though, as we shall see, the cooling may be fast early on). Neptune could also be explained with
∼1,000–2,000 K cooling and an ice-dominated-specific heat (CP ∼× ).
5.3 Diﬀerentiation
If some fraction x of a planet settled to the bottom and was ∼twice as dense as mean density,
then you might expect the total energy release to be ∼xGM/2R. Averaged over 4.5 × 10years,
one then has
L/M ∼× −x for Jupiter
and ∼.× −x for Saturn,
(4.31)
so this could easily be important.

Gas and Ice Giant Interiors
Let us now consider what happens if we attribute all the heat flow from the giant planets
to secular cooling. Suppose the atmosphere has opacity κ. Optical depth unity is by definition
the level at which ρκH∼1, where H is the atmospheric pressure scale height. But P∼ρgH ∼g/κ.
If g does not change much through the planet’s history, and the opacity is likewise constant,
then the outer boundary condition for the planet’s adiabatic interior is a fixed pressure Pe and it
is associated temperature Te (which will certainly vary). For Jupiter and Saturn, this “effective
pressure” for the outer boundary condition is about 1 bar.
Now let us attribute to Jupiter a “mean adiabatic index” Γ defined so that T∼PΓ along an
adiabat. It follows that
Tint
Te
= ( Pint
Pe
)
Γ
= A(some constant, independent of time)
(4.32)
where Tint and Pint are typical internal or central temperatures and pressures. This is our basis
for estimating the temperature inside Jupiter and how it varies over geologic time. In fact, it
turns out that since Te ∼170 K (Jupiter, now), Pe ∼bar, Pint ∼Megabars, and Γ ∼.(all
the way from ideal gas to deep interior), we get Tint ∼, K. Thus, A is around 100 not just
now but throughout the history of the planet. This ignores the role of any rock or ice core (but
note that the heat stored in such a core is small because the specific heat of such materials is low
compared to hydrogen.)
Since we know that the radioactive decay of long-lived isotopes cannot contribute signif-
icantly to the heat output of giant planets, let us try a Kelvin model in which the heat output
is due to the leakage of primordial heat (heat trapped when the planet formed). Let us first
estimate the maximum temperature rise during formation:
ΔT ∼GM

for Jupiter. This is much larger than current estimates for Jupiter’s mean temperatureso the idea
is not unreasonable. From the virial theorem,

which can be solved straightforwardly to find the time that must elapse to get from an initial

= .approx). If one uses
the approximation x ≫(which is not really true except at early times), then clearly x ∼t−/.
The time it takes to cool from a much hotter state to the present state is thus found to be about
0.25 Kelvin times, where the numerical factor arises because the initial cooling is fast. Applied
to the data, one finds that:

improving this, and the rumors (2007–2008) suggest 0.15. But this indirect method is notoriously unreliable
The interpretation for Jupiter is that Kelvin cooling could explain the luminosity (but see
below). The interpretation for Saturn is that we need an extra energy source. The interpretation
for Uranus and Neptune is that either the planets did not start out hot or they do not convect
from top to bottom. The latter seems more plausible, given their energy of formation.
In Jupiter and Saturn, helium is expected to be insoluble below some critical temperature.
This is because they contain metallic hydrogen, and noble gases are highly insoluble in metallic
hydrogen. Droplets would then form and settle toward the center of the planet. The energy
release from this process in Jupiter is potentially enormous such that only 10% of the helium
needs to rainout to supply all of Jupiter’s luminosity for a billion years or more. In Saturn, where
the gravity is smaller, the planet is smaller and the rainout distance probably smaller (even
expressed as a fraction of the radius), the energy release is much less …about half of the helium
would need to rain out. The observations are these (>Table 4-5).
The likely interpretation is that Jupiter is experiencing rainout and the size of the helium
change is small because the planet is hotter than Saturn and also somewhatbuffered …. Rainout
releases heat which reduces further rainout. Saturn has experienced more rainout because it is
a smaller planet and it is also somewhat colder.
The lower heat flows (longer “ages”) for Uranus and Neptune are best explained by sup-
posing that these planets are not well mixed: Much of the heat emplaced during accretion is
unable to escape because of a compositional gradient. About one-half of the heat content must
be trapped and not contributing to the current heat flow. Uranus is more affected than Neptune
and it is also closer to the Sun, which buffers the escape of heat.

The Gravity Field
External to a planet (in a region where there is no or negligible mass), the gravitational potential
V satisfies Laplace’s equation
∇V = 
(4.36)
It makes sense to use a planet-centered spherical coordinate system,and in that case, the general
solution to Laplace’s equation can be written in the form
V = 

∑
ℓ=
ℓ
∑
m=
[ a
r ]
ℓ+
(Cℓm cos mφ + Sℓm sin mφ)Pm
ℓ(cos θ)
(4.37)
Angle θ is colatitude and φ is longitude. The reference radius a is conventionally taken to be
the equatorial radius. The solution assumes no external sources of mass (i.e., all terms decay
as r goes to infinity). The Ps are associated Legendre functions, and along with the sines and
cosines of longitude, they define spherical harmonics usually written Yℓm. The C’s and S’s are
called spherical harmonic coefficients.
Obviously, Cis nothing other than GM. (By the way, GM can be measured to twelve-figure
accuracy for Earth, but that does not mean we know M that well! G is the least well-known
fundamental constant and very hard to measure.) Precise tracking of an orbiting spacecraft
can give you these coefficients. As in any mathematical representation, one always truncate the
representation and thus fail to characterize very high harmonics. This is a potential problem
even in quite low-planetary orbits.
In the special case where the planet is a rotating hydrostatic fluid, symmetry arguments
alone dictate that the potential is axisymmetric (only m = terms allowed) provided we choose
our polar axis to be coincident with the rotation axis. Moreover, there is no physical distinction
between northern and southern hemispheres, so odd λ values are excluded. (This assumes we
have chosen the origin of coordinates to be the center of mass.) We can then write the potential
in the form
V = GM
r
[−

∑
ℓ=
Jℓ[ a

(4.38)
In this simple case, the Ps are now the simple Legendre polynomials, and the Js are called grav-
itational moments. In rapidly rotating planets, Jis generally far larger than any of the other
harmonics (except of course C).
The fundamental definition of the gravitational potential is, of course
V(⃗r) = G
∫
all space
ρ(⃗r′)dr′
∣⃗r −⃗r′∣
(4.39)
obtained by adding up the contributions of all masses and appealing to the superposition prin-
ciple (the linearity of Newtonian gravity). Outside the planet, one can appeal to the fundamental
theorem (also known in mathematics as the generating function)

But we only need to keep track of m = , for evaluating Jλ (because these are the only terms
that contribute to the integral):
Pℓ(cos γ) = Pℓ(cos θ)Pℓ(cos θ′) + m ≠terms
(4.42)
so it follows immediately that
Jℓ= −

Maℓ∫r′ℓPℓ(cos θ′)ρ(r′)dr′
(4.43)
One can see already why the Js are called gravitational moments since they are integrals of the
internal density distribution, weighted by progressively higher powers of the radius.
Recalling that P(cos θ) = (cosθ −)/, one can see immediately that
MaJ= −∫[
z−
(x+ y+ z)] ρ(r)dr
(4.44)
where x, y, z is a Cartesian coordinate system in which z is along the rotation axis. Now if we
define the axial moment of inertia as C and the other two-principle moments of inertia as A
and B, then we have
C ≡∫(x+ y)ρ(r)dr
A ≡∫(z+ y)ρ(r)dr;
B ≡∫(z+ x)ρ(r)dr
(4.45)
and it is easy to see that
MaJ= C −
[A + B]
(4.46)
In the special (and highly relevant case) where A = B (i.e., the planet is a body of rotation rather
than triaxial), we have
MaJ= C −A
(4.47)
So this moment is related to the difference between axial and equatorial moments of inertia.
In a similar manner you can show that C∼(B–A)/Ma. (With appropriate choice of zero
longitude, Swill be zero.) But you cannot get the actual values of A, B, and C from the gravity
field; there is insufficient information. You can only get their differences (e.g., C–A).
We saw that Jcan be related to the difference in the moments of inertia about equatorial
and polar axes. An independent piece of information is often available from the precession
rate of a planet. Since the torque acting on a planet depends on C–A and the rate of change of
angular momentum of a planet is proportional to C, precession rate gives you (C–A)/C. One
can then solve for the individual moments of inertia C and A. This is how we know Earth,
Mars, and lunar moments of inertia. (Determination of the Mars’ moment of inertia using Mars
Pathfinder tracking was one of the major accomplishments of that mission.) A somewhat more
complicated version of this approach can work for Mercury. But we ought to be able to figure
out something more from Jalone because its value depends on how the planet responds to its
own rotation, and this response depends on its density distribution. It should be obvious, for
example, (just by looking at the definition as an integral over the interior weighted by radius
squared) that Jwill be small for a body that is centrally concentrated.
Although this is intuitively reasonable, the appropriate theory is quite nasty, and rather little
insight emerges from wallowing in the nastiness. (The full theory involves integro-differential
equations that must be solved on a computer and even then converge slowly.) I will only give

216 4
Gas and Ice Giant Interiors
a feeling for the theory. This will only work if Jis dominated by hydrostatic effects. The theory
explicitly assumes hydrostaticity.
Consider, first, the constant density body. The external potential is obviously completely
determined by the shape of the free surface. Approximate the free surface of this body by the
lowest order non-spherical shape permitted, that is,
rs = r(+ ε.P)
(4.48)
where ris some mean radius, and ε is a dimensionless constant. Inserting in the fundamental
equation for the gravitational potential and using the generating function, one immediately
finds that the only part that depends on Pis of the form
V= GP
r

∫
−
P(cos θ′)d(cos θ′)
r(+εP)
∫

x.πx.ρ.dx
(4.49)
(Vis the amplitude of the coefficient of the Pterm in the external potential. Here and below,
the explicit angular dependence is sometimes omitted since it should be obvious and it makes
the equations less cluttered.) Since the Ps are orthogonal to each other (and remember that P
is unity), the only part of the integral over x that contributes is the part proportional to P.
Therefore,
V

(4.50)
(where the fact has been used that the normalization integral for Legendre functions is /(λ +
)). We have set ro = a (equatorial radius), which is correct to this order of approximation. We
must compare with the expression that defines Jin terms of the external expansion of the field:
VP= −GMa
r
JP
⇒J= −

(4.51)
Consider, now, the gravitational potential evaluated at the actual surface of the body. We must
of course include the effect of rotation (the “centrifugal” effect). Recall that the acceleration is
ωs where s is the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis. The potential that yields this
acceleration is (by integration) obviously ωs/= ωrsinθ/= ωr(−P)/. Now the
total potential must be constant at the surface. This is where the assumption of hydrostaticity
enters. To lowest nonvanishing order in P, this implies that
GM
r(+ εP) −GM
a JP+ 

must have no dependence on P. If it had a dependence on P, then it would not be a constant
on that surface! Notice that we can ignore the differences between r and a, etc., in terms that
are already small (Jand ε are small parameters). Also, ε ≪means that /(+ εP) = −εP
to an excellent approximation. In other words,

where q is a dimensionless measure of planetary rotation:
q ≡ωa
GM
(4.54)
But we already have J= −ε/. Substituting, we get
J= q
;
ε = −q

(4.55)
This is what we mean by the response of the planet to rotation: The gravitational moment is
related to a dimensionless measure of the strength of rotation. In general, we expect that
Jℓ=

∑
n=
Λℓ,nqn+ℓ
(4.56)
with the n = term dominating. For example, Λ,= .for a Maclaurin spheroid (the technical
name for the uniform density case we studied here) and Λ,= −..
Of course, all that we havedone here is find these coefficients in the special case of a uniform
density body (a case where we already know the moment of inertia). But it should be plausible,
and turns out to be actually true, that these coefficients are diagnostic of the density structure.
For example,
Λ,= ( 
π−
) = .
(4.57)
for the case of the model we studied for Jupiter where P = Kρ. This is very different from 0.5.
From J/q, it is possible to estimate the moment of inertia. In practice, use is also made of
the higher harmonics (J, J, …) to better constrain the internal structure. More details on this
theory of figures are found in Guillot (2005) (> Table 4-6). >Table 4-6 shows the observed
values of J/q ≡Λ.

between density structure and measured J2, so the results are expressed here only approximately. Note that the

for these planets to improve the estimates of internal structure

the density profile (even though the radius of the body may change substantially!) However,
if you add a dense core then I/MR∼.(−Mcore/Mtotal). This comes from including the
cos(kr)/kr term in the density profile (see earlier chapter). Since I/MRis somewhat smaller for
Saturn than for Jupiter, it is likely that Saturn has a core.

Magnetic Fields
Giant planet magnetic fields are interesting because all these planets have large fields (greater
or comparable to earth’s field). When a planet has a large field, this requires a dynamic process
(called a dynamo) deep within the planet. Thus, the observed field provides us with insight into
the state of matter and the dynamics deep within a planet; there is no other way to do this.
Except for the special case of Jupiter, which is a synchrotron source of radio waves, we learn
about planetary magnetic fields by the direct detection of the field (the magnetosphere) in a
flyby or orbiter spacecraft. This is usually done with a magnetometer, which is an instrument
that detects change in flux through a coil.
>Table 4-7 shows the observations (including earth for comparison), with likely interpre-
tations (explained more fully below).
For Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn (and probably Ganymede), the field is predominantly dipolar
but with detected higher harmonics (except for Ganymede). The tilt of the dipole relative to the
rotation axis is of order 10○(Jupiter and Earth) and zero (Saturn).
For Uranus and Neptune, the field is about equally dipole and quadrupole, and the tilt of the
dipole is 40○–60○.
There is a detailed discussion of planetary magnetic fields in Stevenson (2003) and the
>Chap. 6. In Jupiter and Saturn, the magnetic fields are thought to be generated by convection
in the metallic hydrogen region. Jupiter’s field is larger because the dynamo region extends to
larger radius and perhaps also because the energy source is larger. However, this does not seem
to fully explain the relative size of Jupiter’s field compared to Saturn. The remarkable axisym-
metry of Saturn’s field may be explained by the effect of differential rotation at depth, but even
in this model, it is difficult to get such a small dipole tilt as that observed. It is hoped that this
will be better understood at the end of the Cassini mission. The fields of Uranus and Neptune
may be explainable by convection in a shell, bounded above by insulating fluid and below by
electrically conducting but stably stratified fluid. This is compatible with the unexpectedly low
heat flow explained in >Sect. 5 above.

Detailed Models
There is no doubt that Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium. No other material
of sufficiently low density can explain the global properties of these bodies. However, Jupiter
is much closer to cosmic (or primordial solar) composition than Saturn. Roughly speaking,
Jupiter and Saturn have similar total amounts of heavy elements (all elements heavier than
hydrogen or helium), but Jupiter is over three times the mass of Saturn. We have constraints
on the interior structure of these bodies that arise primarily from the observed gravity field
(including the gravitational moments caused by planetary rotation) but also from deep atmo-
sphere composition, magnetic field, heat flow, and laboratory and theoretical equations of state.
Jupiter may have a dense core; Saturn almost certainly has a dense core. It may seem surprising
that we can be more precise about Saturn than about Jupiter, since better data exist for Jupiter.
However, the putative core of Jupiter is a tiny fraction of the total mass, perhaps at most a few
percent (i.e., three to ten or so Earth masses), and it accordingly has a very small effect on plan-
etary structure. The common practice of placing a separate core of heavy elements at the centers
of these planets is governed by simplicity, rather than by observation. To varying degrees, the
“core” could have a fuzzy boundary with the overlying hydrogen-rich envelope. Uncertainties
in the hydrogen equation of state continue to be a major source of uncertainty in the interior
models.
Both of these planets are enriched in heavy elements throughout (and separate from the
presence or absence of a core). In Jupiter, this enrichment is probably about a factor of 3 relative
to cosmic abundance and is readily observed in those volatile components that do not condense
out in the observable atmosphere. We cannot be sure that this is the enrichment for water, which
condenses out deep and was not observed to be enriched in the presumably dry region that
Galileo probe sampled. Water is the most abundant carrier of oxygen and therefore presumably
the most abundant heavy material in Jupiter. However, interior models support about ten Earth
masses of heavy elements mixed throughout the hydrogen, consistent with this factor of 3. It is
particularly interesting that this factor of 3 is even seen in the heavy noble gases, including
argon. The threefold enrichment of argon suggests delivery to Jupiter of material that condensed
at very low temperatures, probably around 40 K, since there is no known way of incorporating
argon into solid bodies in large amounts at higher temperature. These planets also supported in
situ formation of a satellite system. The Galilean satellite system is particularly impressive and
may contain important clues to the last stages of giant planet formation.
Uranus and Neptune are far less well understood than Jupiter or Saturn. However, there is no
doubt that they are mostly ice and rock, yet also possess two or so Earth masses of gas each. The
atmospheres have solar hydrogen to helium ratios (though with large uncertainty because this
determination is based on the pressure induced absorption features of hydrogen, a method that
has been unreliable for Jupiter and Saturn). The amount of hydrogen extractable from the ices is
in principle about 0.2 of the total mass(assuming the hydrogen was delivered as water, methane,
and ammonia), and this is marginally close to the hydrogen mass required by interior models.
Moreover, there is the possibility that methane would decompose into carbon and hydrogen at
extreme pressures. However, the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune are highly enriched in
methane (thus limiting massive decomposition of this compound to very deep regions, if any),
and there is no experimental or theoretical evidence for extensive decomposition of water or
ammonia under the conditions encountered inside these bodies. Consequently, it is not plau-
sible to derive even one Earth mass of predominantly hydrogen gas from the breakdown of
hydrogen-bearing ice or rock, even leaving aside the dubious proposition that such decomposed

hydrogen would rise to the outer regions of the planet. This gas appears to have come from the
solar nebula. Uranus and Neptune must have formed largely in the presence of the solar nebula,
a very stringent constraint on the formation of solid bodies.
It is often supposed that the presence or absence of a core in Jupiter (say) can be placed in
one-to-one correspondence with the presence or absence of a nucleating body that caused the
inflow of gas to form the much more massive envelope. However, there is no neat correspon-
dence between mode of giant planet formation and current presence of a core. The nucleation
model is still the favored model for making these planets, but a discussion of this is beyond the
intent of this chapter (for more details, see Lissauer and Stevenson (2006)) (>Fig. 4-3).

The Challenges
There are many possibilities that have not been discussed here. Gravity can involve more than
the response of the planet to uniform rotation; perhaps one can see the signal of differential
rotation or even convection. Certainly, the tides raised by large satellites may be detectable, and
the gravitational signal of the Lense-Thirring effect (a general relativistic effect) may be seen by
the Juno spacecraft. Perhaps the most intriguing and most important possibility lies in seismol-
ogy, a technique that has been immensely important for understanding earth structure, there
are tentative detections of normal modes for Jupiter that provide information on the internal
structure (Gaulme et al. 2011).
Future developments in this field are likely to be in three areas: (1) improved observations
of our planets by spacecraft, (2) improved thermodynamic data from theory and experiment,
and (3) exoplanet measurements.

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets
Abstract:
The giant planets of the solar system have been studied for centuries using a wide
range of remote sensing and in situ techniques. An understanding of the atmospheres of Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune has dramatically improved since the dawn of spacecraft explo-
ration of the outer solar system in the 1970s. Cloud decks that were predicted to exist from
thermochemical equilibrium arguments have been observationally confirmed, although the
exact vertical distribution of condensible species in these atmospheres remains an active area
of study. All four of the giant planets have fast zonal (east-west) winds with prograde and retro-
grade jets, which dominate their atmospheric circulations. Each planet also contains long-lived
cyclonic features or convective cloud features that appear and disappear on short timescales.
These features suggest a link between the energy transport in the deep atmosphere and the
visible cloud tops; the exact nature of this connection remains an outstanding question in
giant planet atmosphere studies. The chemistry of the giant planet atmospheres is driven by
both the convective processes that loft disequilibrium species from the deep atmosphere into
the stratosphere and the interaction between stratospheric materials and ultraviolet sunlight.
A unique opportunity to study these interactions was presented to planetary scientists in 1994,
when the 22 fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy9 impacted Jupiter. The future of giant planet
atmospheric studies is promising. Several mission concepts that will answer fundamental ques-
tions regarding giant planet atmospheres are in various stages of development, and the James
Webb Space Telescope will also contribute especially to our understanding of Uranus and Nep-
tune. As an understanding of giant planet formation and evolution expands and deepens, these
knowledge gains must be examined against the backdrop of the numerous exoplanet systems
recently discovered, very few of which resemble our own.

Introduction
The gas giant planets differ in many ways from the rocky planets of the inner solar system.
Historically, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have been considered to be a class of objects
within the solar system unto themselves – they are large, made primarily of gas and ices, they
each possess ring systems, and they are orbited by a plethora of moons. More recently, plane-
tary scientists have made the distinction between the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, and
the smaller ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. > Figure 5-1 contains an image montage of the
four giant planets of our solar system, and >Table 5-1 lists some of the orbital and physical
parameters for all four planets.
An examination of >Table 5-1 reveals obvious distinctions between the gas giants and ice
giants in terms of size, mass, and composition. The massesof Uranus and Neptune are similar to
each other, whereas Jupiter and Saturn have widely different masses that are both much larger
than those of Uranus and Neptune. Given that the radii of Jupiter and Saturn are not vastly
different, this suggests that Jupiter is much more internally compressed than Saturn. The gas
giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and
Neptune are primarily composed of ices such as methane and water. All four of the giant planets
rotate rapidly, resulting in oblateness values that are much larger than those of the terrestrial
planets (e.g., the oblateness of Earth is 0.00034).
Two competing models of solar system formation, the gravitational instability and the core
accretion models, are invoked to explain many of the bulk properties of the solar system as

well as the general distinctions between the gas giants and the ice giants. The gravitational
instability model posits that the protostellar disk became dense enough to be gravitationally
unstable and the giant planets formed directly through gravitational collapse of the circumstel-
lar disk. The core accretion model proposes the growth of ice-rock giant planet cores through
the collision of planetesimals, followed by gas accretion from the nearby regions of the proto-
solar nebula. The core accretion model provides a better explanation for the observed nonsolar
(enriched) abundances of heavy elements in the outer solar system, but there are still problems
with both models that have been highlighted by the discovery of numerous extrasolar planetary
systems that do not resemble our own. Despite these new discoveries, the giant planets of our
own solar system remain the best laboratories for studying solar system formation and evolu-
tion, and these areas have been driving scientific themes in the history of planetary exploration.
The giant planets of the outer solar system have been explored by spacecraft beginning
in 1973 with the Pioneer 10 mission to Jupiter. Since that time, all four giant planets have
been visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and both Jupiter and Saturn have been explored by
orbiters. >Table 5-2 lists the past, present, and planned missions to the giant planets in our
solar system.

The spacecraft exploration of these large giant worlds of the outer solar system, along with
the concomitant ground-based telescopic observations, has yielded numerous answers to out-
standing questions about the giant planets and generated at least as many new unanswered
questions. However, there are several fundamental areas of study related to giant planet atmo-
spheres in which significantlyincreased understanding has emerged overthe past three decades.
The giant planet atmospheric structure, dynamics, and chemistry are key to understanding the
physical processes that govern planetary atmospheres in general and will provide important
insight into the atmospheres of the newly discovered planets around other stars, which are
discussed further in
>Chap. 10. >Section 2 of this chapter describes the structure and com-
position of giant planet atmospheres. In >Sect. 3, the dynamical processes that influence these
atmospheres are reviewed, and in >Sect. 4, the role that atmospheric chemistry plays in giant
planet atmospheres is discussed. A summary of unanswered questions and future directions in
the study of giant planet atmospheres is presented in >Sect. 5. The printed form of this chapter
is an abridged version; a more extensive version is available in the online volume of this text.

Atmospheric Composition and Structure
Clues concerning the composition and vertical structure of the giant planet atmospheres can
be found in the protosolar nebula. Based on the chemical abundances of the nebula, out of
which the giant planets formed, thermochemical equilibrium models are used to predict the
pressure-temperature regimes at which various molecules condense. Using such arguments,
Weidenschilling and Lewis (1973) identified the following condensibles on the giant planets: for
Jupiter and Saturn, cloud decks of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide (NHSH), and water are
predicted (> Figs. 5-2 and >5-3, respectively); for Uranus and Neptune, clouds of methane and

water ice are predicted (>Fig. 5-4). Methane is also present in the atmospheres of Jupiter and
Saturn, in smaller abundances than in Uranus and Neptune, but the atmospheric temperatures
of the gas giants are warm enough that methane never condenses there.
All of the giant planet atmospheres contain a temperature minimum located at the
tropopause; above that, temperatures increase with height due to the absorption of sunlight by
stratosphericaerosols and the methane gas absorption bands (>Fig. 5-5). Below the tropopause,
temperatures increase with increasing depth as the most efficient means of energy transport is
convection and the atmospheric temperature profile is roughly adiabatic. This portion of the
atmosphere is heated from below.
In this discussion, we adopt the atmospheric nomenclature defined by West et al. (2004) for
the Jovian atmosphere, where a haze is defined as a ubiquitous layer of particles smaller than a
micron in size and located in the upper troposphere (200–500 mbar) and in the stratosphere
(P < 100 mbar). We refer to clouds when discussing more spatially and temporally variable
assemblages of larger particles at deeper levels.
2.1 Cloud Locations
For several decades, the true chemical identities of the clouds in the giant planet atmospheres
remained unconfirmed. Although on Jupiter and Saturn the uppermost cloud is assumed to be

made of ammonia ice based on the thermochemical equilibrium calculations described above,
spectroscopic evidence of this remained elusive. It was not until the Galileo mission provided
detailed views of the Jovian cloud deck with the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS)
that spectrally identified ammonia clouds (SIACs) were detected in localized regions on Jupiter
(Baines et al. 2002). A 3-µm absorption feature seen in both space-based and ground-based
infrared spectra of Jupiter was initially attributed to ammonia (Brooke et al. 1998), but more
recent improved model fits suggest a layer of small ammonia-coated particles overlying an opti-
cally thicker layer of larger NHSH particles (Sromovsky and Fry 2010). The fact that Jupiter’s
SIACs are short-lived, i.e., last on the order of a few days, seems at odds with the prediction that
the upper cloud decks of Jupiter and Saturn are composed of ammonia ice, and suggests that
some other process such as photochemical “tanning” or a coating of the pure ammonia ice is
commonplace in the giant planet atmospheres.
Confirmation of Jupiter’s water cloud also remained challenging. Water vapor was detected
on Jupiter using spectroscopic observations from the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft (Carlson
et al. 1992; Roos-Serote et al. 1998) as well as airborne telescopes flying high in Earth’s atmo-
sphere (Larson et al. 1975; Bjoraker et al. 1986). Since these observations probed to pressure
levels ∼5 bars in the jovian atmosphere, the presence of water vapor was not surprising given

the thermochemistry believed to have taken place in Jupiter’s atmosphere. However, it was
also expected that Jupiter’s vigorous convection should be strong enough to loft water vapor
to higher and colder altitudes, where it would condense into ice and be seen above the ammo-
nia cloud deck. Yet no ubiquitous water ice signatures were detected by the Voyager Infrared
Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) instrument (Hanel et al. 1979).
The presence of water ice on Jupiter was not confirmed until vertical structure studies using
Galileo Orbiter imaging data (Banfield et al. 1998; Gierasch et al. 2000) motivated a reexam-
ination of Voyager data. The identification of convective thunderstorm clouds in Galileo and
Voyager imagery prompted Simon-Miller et al. (2000) to reexamine the Voyager IRIS data.
They found that approximately 1% of the spectra analyzed contained a far-infrared absorption
feature attributable to water ice but that the optical depth of the water ice was not large enough
to distinguish this cloud against the denser overlying ammonia cloud deck.
The vertical locations, thicknesses, and compositions of the cloud layers in the giant planet
atmospheres are determined through vertical structure modeling, which has generally been
conducted using two different approaches. Forward modeling techniques assume a basic cloud
structure with some number of free parameters that describe the aerosol physical properties,
layer thicknesses, and locations. These modelsuse a radiative transfer code to generatesynthetic
spectra or center-to-limb (CTL) brightness variation curves. These spectra or CTL curves are

then compared with observations, and the free parameters in the model are subsequently varied
iteratively until the synthetic curves or spectra that best match observational data are achieved.
An alternative approach is an inversion technique, where inferences about an atmosphere’s
structure can be made from observational data.
Aerosol optical and radiative properties are determined from remote sensing measure-
ments. Multiwavelength atmospheric radiance measurements are used as inputs to radiative
transfer modeling codes, and the physical properties of the aerosol layers (e.g., particle size,
optical depth) can be computed. >Figures 5-6 and >5-7 show the depths to which one can
sound in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, as a function of wavelength.
2.1.1 Limitations of Remote Sensing
The atmosphere of Jupiter is the best-studied among the four giant planets. Jupiter’s large size
and relative proximity to Earth have enabled amateur and professional astronomers alike to
conduct long-term monitoring of the Jovian atmosphere with first photographic and now CCD
imaging techniques. A historical record of Jupiter observations can yield important insight into
long-term changes in the giant planet atmospheres (Beebe et al. 1989), but such observations are
limited in scope. As technologies such as adaptive optics and infrared imaging have improved,
so has the demand for observing facilities with such capabilities. Thus, regular access to these
new advances over decadelong time scales has remained a challenge for ground-based giant
planet observers.
Historically amateur astronomers have made significant contributions to the study of giant
planet atmospheres, earlier through their careful drawings and now more commonly with
their photography and digital imagery of Jupiter and Saturn. With modest-sized telescopes

methane, phosphine, and H2 pressure-induced absorption features are indicated (From Baines
(personal communication))
(∼25–35 cm mirror diameter) and rapid imaging cameras, amateur observers can produce very
high-quality images by taking observations at a very high-time cadence. A small subset of these
images is taken in very brief moments of excellent seeing. (This is sometimes referred to as the
“lucky imaging” technique, cf. Law et al. 2006.) Postprocessing software is then used to identify
the best images out of the gigabytes of data acquired in one night. The amateur observers regu-
larly contribute their images to the Atmospheres Node of the International Outer Planets Watch
through its online database, the Planetary Virtual Observatory and Laboratory (PVOL), where
the data can be viewed by professional and amateurastronomers worldwide (Hueso et al. 2010).
In addition to the long-term monitoring of atmospheric phenomena enabled by this rich his-
torical record, amateur astronomers have been the first to report many significant phenomena
in giant planet atmospheres, such as color changes (e.g., the reddening of White Oval BA) and
bolide impacts. The PVOL images generally lack absolute photometric calibration and spectral
information other than that afforded by broadband and sometimes a methane absorption fil-
ter, so their strength primarily lies in their extensive temporal coverage, which can elucidate
dynamical changes in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.
The geometry of the solar system also limits the information one can glean from Earth
concerning the physical characteristics (size, shape, scattering properties) of the giant planet
aerosols. Large variations in phase angle, or the observer-target-Sun angle, are necessary to
accurately quantify the scattering properties of the giant planet aerosols, yet from Earth we
are limited to maximum phase angles of ∼11○, 6○, 3○, and 2○for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune, respectively. Only spacecraft observations can achieve much larger phase angles, and
as can be seen from >Table 5-2, those opportunities have been limited in number.
Finally, remote sensing observations of the giant planet atmospheres can probe a variety
of pressure levels and aerosol layers by capitalizing on the vertical discrimination afforded

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets 5
233
by various molecular absorption bands. It remains difficult to accurately sound below the
visible cloud deck, though, due to the increasing opacity with depth. Models used to deter-
mine atmospheric structure based on cloud reflectivity measurements are often plagued with
nonuniqueness problems because variations in several different parameters can produce the
same observed effect. For example, to explain the contrasts seen in Jupiter’s clouds at con-
tinuum wavelengths, two different modeling approaches have been used. Forward modeling
studies such as those by West et al. (1986) and Chanover et al. (1997) find that the contin-
uum contrasts are mostly due to spatial variations in the single-scattering albedo of the upper
cloud, whereas models used by Banfield et al. (1998) and Sromovsky and Fry (2002) suggest
that optical depth variations are largely the cause of cloud contrasts (West et al. 2004). More
spacecraft observations over a wide range of wavelengths and phase angles are needed to break
this degeneracy.
2.2 In Situ Measurements
The atmosphere of Jupiter is currently the only one of the four giant planets that has been
explored via in situ measurements made from an entry probe. The Galileo probe entered
Jupiter’s atmosphere on December 7, 1995 and descended through the Jovian atmosphere,
transmitting data for 61 min before contact was lost when the probe was near the 24-bar
pressure level (Young et al. 1996) (> Fig. 5-8). The probe was equipped with an instrument
suite designed to characterize Jupiter’s inner magnetosphere as well as the atmospheric cloud
structure, chemical environment, and wind field. The lightning and radio emission detector
(LRD) and the energetic particle instrument (EPI) were used to characterize the energetic par-
ticles in the innermost regions of Jupiter’s radiation environment. The EPI data were acquired
⊡Fig. 5-8

234 5

during the preentry phase of the mission, whereas the LRD operated throughout the descent
phase as well. The chemical composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere was directly measured with
two instruments. The helium abundance detector determined Jupiter’s relative helium abun-
dance with greater accuracy than previous estimates, which has important implications for
giant planet and solar system formation theories. The neutral mass spectrometer measured
mixing ratios of both major and minor species in the Jovian atmosphere as well as isotopic
ratios. These in situ measurements were critical for determining the relative contributions
of the protosolar nebula and icy planetesimals of the outer solar system to the giant planet
atmospheres (Young 2003).
The vertical structure and optical properties of Jupiter’s atmosphere were quantified using
three instruments: the nephelometer, which was designed to measure the aerosol scatter-
ing properties and locations; the atmospheric structure instrument (ASI), which measured
the atmospheric thermal structure and vertical winds; and the net flux radiometer (NFR),
which was used to determine the vertical distribution of atmospheric heating and cooling and
atmospheric opacity throughout the probe’s descent phase. Finally, the Galileo probe mission
included a Doppler wind experiment (DWE), which was not a separate instrument on board
the probe. Rather, the Doppler delay of the probe relay carrier frequency was used to determine
the deep zonal winds, i.e., below the cloud decks, in Jupiter’s atmosphere.
The Galileoprobe entered Jupiter’s atmosphere at a latitude of6.5○N in the North Equatorial
Belt, a region characterized by bright white convective plumes and darker, relatively cloud-free,
areas of subsidence between the plumes. It descended through Jupiter’s atmosphere in one of
the interplume downwelling regions (Orton et al. 1998), thus providing an unexpected and
likelysomewhat atypical picture ofthe Jovian atmosphere. The Galileoprobe measured a helium
abundance lower than that expected from the protosolar nebular predictions, which indicates
that helium may have gravitationally settled deeper in Jupiter’s interior (von Zahn et al. 1998).
Neon was found to be severely depleted, while C, N, S, Ar, Kr, and Xe were all measured with
∼3× solar abundance. Condensible species such as HO, NH, and HS were all depleted, which
is likely due to the unique nature of the probe entry site (Niemann et al. 1998). The jovian cloud
structure sensed by the Galileo probe contained a tenuous cloud with a base at 0.5 bar, a thin
but well-defined cloud with a base at 1.4 bar, and another tenuous aerosol layer between ∼2.4
and 3.6 bars (Ragent et al. 1998; Sromovsky et al. 1998). The lack of detection of a deep water
cloud suggests that a dynamical process, i.e., a strong downdraft, was responsible for clearing
this region of Jupiter’s atmosphere. Jupiter’s zonal (east-west) winds appeared to extend down
at least to the depth where the probe data collection ceased (Atkinson et al. 1998), but this again
may be due to the localized conditions in this downwelling region rather than a result that is
broadly applicable to the entire planet. The Galileo probe results were key for improving the
understanding of giant planet formation and evolution, and they highlighted the need for in
situ measurements of giant planet atmospheres that are complementary to the richer orbiter
and ground-based data sets.

Atmospheric Dynamics
The dynamics of the giant planet atmospheres are driven by a combination of solar input (which
for Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune varies seasonally) and internal heat.Below the cloud decks, the
atmospheres of the giant planets are believed to be adiabatic. One of the fundamental questions
of giant planet atmospheric dynamics is the manner in which their atmospheric circulations
are linked to the abyssal circulations.

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets 5

3.1 Winds
The winds on the giant planets are the fastest in the solar system. >Figure 5-9 shows the mean
zonal (east-west) wind profiles for each of the four Jovian planets. The profiles are all char-
acterized by east-west jets, with prograde equatorial jets for Jupiter and Saturn, which also
have a greater total number of jets, and retrograde equatorial jets for Uranus and Neptune.
All four of the giant planets exhibit remarkable north-south symmetry in their zonal wind
profiles. >Figure 5-10 shows Jupiter’s zonal wind profile overlaid on a cylindrical map made
from HST images. We see a strong correlation between the zonal wind jet maxima and minima
and the banding of Jupiter’s clouds, indicating that these jets are responsible for Jupiter’s visible
appearance.
The meridional (north-south) winds on the giant planets are several orders of magnitude
weaker than the zonal winds, indicating that the giant planets, circulation is dominated by east-
west motions. As shown in >Table 5-1, there is considerable variation among the gas giants in
terms ofboth solarinsolation and internal heat. This suggests that the forcing of the atmospheric
circulation in these planetary atmospheres is largely a function of their formation and rapid
rotation.
Uranus is unique among the giant planets in that its equilibrium temperature is quite close
to its true disk-averaged temperature (> Table 5-1). This implies that any internal heat, if it
exists, is inefficiently transferred to the observable weather layer. In contrast with Voyager 2

measurements, which show an adiabatic lapse rate below approximately the 0.1 bar level, deep
interior models of Uranus suggest strong molecular gradients that should inhibit convection
(Guillot 1999). Thus, even if internal heat within Uranus is substantial, the planet is prevented
from following the usual path of heat transfer from its interior used by other gas giants.
It is expected that solar insolation plays a considerable role in the energy budget of Uranus’
weather layer. Uranus’ ratio of total emitted infrared irradiance to that of absorbed solar heating,
as shown in >Table 5-1, is significantly less than that found on the other giant planets. Com-
bined with Uranus’ extreme axial tilt, seasonal variations of atmospheric dynamics are expected
to be significant in the radiative boundary layer and potentially deeper. The current epoch rep-
resents a unique opportunity for us to analyze seasonal forcing of atmospheric dynamics, as
Uranus reached its equinox in December 2007. Uranus’ last equinox took place in 1965, before
the advent of modern detectors, thus we are currently in a “new” age for Uranus atmospheric
studies, since both its northern and southern hemispheres are receiving roughly equal amounts
of sunlight for the first time in 42 years. Neptune, on the other hand, has the largest internal heat
contribution to its outgoing flux of all the giant planets. Thus, a comparative study of the role
that insolation plays in driving the atmospheric dynamics on the planets with the two extrema
in energy balance can reveal important clues to their divergent evolution.
3.1.1 Observational Evidence for Seasonal Changes on Uranus and Neptune
At first glance, a comparison between recent images of Uranus taken near equinox and Voy-
ager 2 images of the planet taken near solstice immediately reveals obvious changes in Uranus’
atmosphere (> Fig. 5-11). Recent near-infrared imaging with the Keck AO system and the
Hubble Space Telescope (Sromovsky and Fry 2005; Hammel et al. 2005) shows an increase
in the number of discrete cloud features when compared with 1986 Voyager 2 visible imag-
ing, particularly in the late winter northern hemisphere. However, this comparison is likely

⊡Fig. 5-12
Left: near-IR Keck images of Uranus showing a new bright band forming in Uranus’ northern
hemisphere, which is seen on the right side of each image. Right: HST images illustrating the evo-
lution of Uranus’ south polar cap from 1994 to 2004 (All images courtesy of Sromovsky (personal
communication))
oversimplified: some of this increase is certainly due to the higher contrast of clouds in the NIR
as well as improved visibility of the equatorial latitudes and northern hemisphere as Uranus
approaches equinox (Karkoschka 2001). Nonetheless, seasonal change may also play a role in
the increase of observable cloud features.
A more compelling argument that seasonal change is occurring on Uranus is the observed
asymmetry in the cloud bands, as seen in the right panel of
> Fig. 5-11 as well as in
>Fig. 5-12. The bright band in the southern hemisphere is probably not a permanent feature
of Uranus’ atmosphere; any fixed pattern would most likely be symmetric about the equator to
match the symmetry of the annual average distribution of solar heating within the atmosphere.
In fact, a north-south asymmetry is just what would be expected for a seasonal response to
solar forcing when that response has a time constant that is long enough to cause a large delay
in response but not so long that the response is completely washed out. If the cloud pattern

238 5
Atmospheres of Jovian Planets
on Uranus does indeed manifest seasonal change, it should have begun to reverse just before
equinox. In fact, that reversal is being seen: the southern band is declining in brightness and a
new band is forming in the northern hemisphere (Rages et al. 2007; >Fig. 5-12, left panel). The
bright polar cap that used to be an obvious feature of the southern hemisphere began to decline
even earlier (Rages et al. 2004; >Fig. 5-12, right panel), which may indicate a seasonal response
with an even shorter time constant.
In addition to the more frequent appearance of discrete clouds and changes in large-scale
banded cloud patterns, Uranus’ zonal winds may also demonstrate seasonal change. While the
Sromovsky and Fry (2005) observations, acquired in 2003 and 2004, show no clear evidence
of seasonal change in the zonal winds, Hammel et al. (2005) do find significant changes in
wind speeds from 2000 to 2003, with an increase of approximately 30 m/s in the 20–50○N lati-
tude range. This issue requires further study with new observations spanning a wider seasonal
coverage, but the possible linkage between zonal winds and seasonally varying insolation is
tantalizing.
Radio observations of Uranus at 2 and 6 cm were also suggested to show evidence of sea-
sonal change (Hofstadter and Butler 2003). These wavelengths probe much deeper than visible
imaging, down to approximately 50 bars. A pole-to-equator radio brightness gradient has been
known to exist even prior to the Voyager 2 flyby. However, while this gradient remained rela-
tively constant from 1981 to 1989, it may have undergone an increase in magnitude between
1989 and 1994. Such a gradient is generally interpreted as an equatorial enhancement in con-
densable gases such as NHSH rather than a true temperature gradient (de Pater et al. 1991).
This may imply a Hadley-like circulation in which upwelling gases near the equator condense
out while depleted gases are subsiding near the pole (> Fig. 5-13). Thus, an increase in the
magnitude of this brightness gradient may indicate a seasonal invigoration of this circulation.
Observations of Uranus between 1 mm and 20 cm do not reveal any hemispheric asymme-
tries, only pole-to-equator variations (Hofstadter, personal communication), suggesting that
the processes governing ice giant radio brightnesses differ from those causing the observed vari-
ations in reflected sunlight. Neptune, on the other hand, does exhibit hemispheric asymmetries

at radio wavelengths. In the early 1990s both of Neptune’s polar regions were brighter than its
equator. Today, close to southern summer solstice, Neptune’s south pole is still radio bright, but
the north pole is not visible (Hofstadter, personal communication). The link between seasonal
insolation and ice giant atmospheric dynamics clearly warrants further study.
Uranus’ extreme axial tilt results in an unusual hemispheric asymmetry in solar energy
deposition. Neptune, on the other hand, is an ice giant planet with a more moderate axial tilt
of nearly 30○. Although its energy balance is more than twice that of Uranus (> Table 5-1),
Neptune also exhibits long-term atmospheric variations, as evidenced by an increase in
disk-averaged brightness (Lockwood and Thompson 2002; Sromovsky et al. 2003). A lagged
seasonal model was invoked by Sromovsky et al. (2003) to explain Neptune’s long-term bright-
ness changes, which they suggested were caused by Neptune’s changing subsolar latitude.
However, the long-term photometric record suggests that something other than seasonal
change is at work; previous investigators also have considered Neptune’s response to the 11-year
solar cycle or its changing heliocentric distance (Lockwood and Jerzykiewicz 2006; Hammel
and Lockwood 2007) as causes for Neptune’s observed temporal variations. It is clear that with
a much larger internal heat source than Uranus, along with a weaker solar flux at its greater
orbital distance, the role of solar insolation in driving atmospheric dynamics on Neptune may
be different than for Uranus.
3.2 Storm Features
Convective activity in the giant planet atmospheres is manifested through the apparition of
storm features over a wide range of size scales. These features vary in diameter, latitudinal and
longitudinal extent, and longevity on each of the giant planets due to the unique aspects of each
atmosphere.
3.2.1 Jupiter
The Jovian atmosphere is teeming with cyclonic and anticyclonic storm features. Several of the
largest of these features are visible even with low-power ground-based telescopes. The most
famous of these storms is the Great Red Spot (GRS), which is more than twice the size of
Earth and has been in existence at least since it was first observed more than 150 years ago
(> Fig. 5-14). It is a high-pressure, anticyclonic, counterclockwise-rotating storm system that
is maintained at a planetocentric latitude of roughly −○by a strong prograde jet to its south
and a strong retrograde jet to its north.
South of the GRS at approximately −○latitude, three smaller anticyclonic white ovals,
named FA, BC, and DE, formed out of the South Temperate Zone (STZ) in 1939. They were
first seen following a period when the STZ rapidly clouded over and became a white band; once
the clouds subsided, they coalesced into three discrete, rotating storm systems (Peek 1953).
In 1998, BC and DE merged to form Oval BE, and in 2000 BE and FA merged to form a single
White Oval, BA. The color of BA changed from white to red in 2005 (> Fig. 5-15). The cause
of this color change is not clear, but it may be due to changing dynamics within the oval that
resulted in the exposure of reddish condensation nuclei that were lofted from Jupiter’s deeper
atmosphere Cheng et al. (2008), Perez-Hoyos et al. 2009.

The coloration of the GRS and, more recently, Oval BA remains an outstanding mystery in
studies of the Jovian atmosphere. West et al. (1986) summarized the state of knowledge at that
time by providing two lists of candidate compounds – both organic and inorganic – that could
be responsible for the coloration of Jupiter’s clouds. These included hydrogen sulfides, allotropes
of phosphorus and sulfur, and irradiated mixtures of hydrogen, methane, and ammonia ices.
There has been relatively little laboratory work done at conditions appropriate for Jovian pres-
sures and temperatures to confirm or rule out these candidate materials as coloring agents in
Jupiter’s atmosphere. Two competing hypotheses have been invoked to explain the sources of
the coloring agents in the giant planet atmospheres: compounds containing sulfur, phospho-
rus, hydrogen, and nitrogen that have been convectively transported upward (West et al. 1986)
and the coating of ammonia ice particles by photochemically produced hydrocarbons (Atreya
et al. 2005; Kalogerakis et al. 2008). High quality multispectral observations of Jupiter’s atmo-
sphere, analyzed with numerical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, indicate

that several chromophores are needed to explain the spatial variations in the Jovian cloud colors
(Simon-Miller et al. 2001a, 2001b; Strycker et al. 2011). However, the exact nature or iden-
tity of these chromophores remains unclear. Further analysis that relates particle microphysics,
atmospheric dynamics, and local radiation field will shed light on this issue. It is important
that we understand the nature of the giant planet chromophores because they are almost surely
linked to the dynamics and photochemistry of those atmospheres and may reveal a production
mechanism for organic molecules.
3.2.2 Saturn
Imaging Saturn’s atmosphericfeatures at high spatial resolution presents a challenge forground-
based telescopes. Until the advent of the CCD cameras in the 1980s, only about a dozen features
were clearly detected visually or photographically over a century of observations (Sánchez-
Lavega 1982). Typically ground-based CCD imaging in the visual range can detect cloud
features on Saturn larger than about 3,000 km if they are located at the sub-Earth point. In
addition, they must have sufficient contrast relative to surrounding clouds to be detected. This
is difficult on Saturn due to the extinction of reflected sunlight by a dense high-altitude haze
layer. The optimal contrast in the optical/CCD wavelength range is found in blue-green and
890 nm methane-band images.
The Voyager 1 and 2 encounters in 1980 and 1981 provided high-resolution images of Sat-
urn’s cloud morphology but in a limited spectral range from violet to red wavelengths. Voyager
images showed that isolated features are rare in Saturn’s atmosphere, but other interesting atmo-
spheric features were seen in the north such as the “ribbon wave” (Sromovsky et al. 1983) and

242 5
Atmospheres of Jovian Planets
⊡Fig. 5-16
Image of Saturn’s “string of pearls” cloud formation, taken with Cassini’s visual and infrared
mapping spectrometer on April 27, 2006 (Image courtesy of NASA)
the “polar hexagon” (Godfrey 1988). Newer Cassini data revealed high quality observations of
Saturn’s north polar hexagon and vortices at both poles (Baines et al. 2009, Dyudina et al. 2009),
as well as additional phenomena such as the “string of pearls” (>Fig. 5-16), which shows reg-
ularly spaced clearings in the clouds (the bright regions in the infrared image in >Fig. 5-16).
This appears to be a manifestation of a planetary-scale wave and is likely linked to the deeper
circulation in Saturn’s atmosphere.
Saturn’s atmosphere also undergoes localized convective activity roughly every 30 years,
which corresponds to approximately once per Saturnian year. These convective outbursts
are manifested by the development of gigantic storm systems known as Great White Spots
(Sánchez-Lavega 1982). A major event occurred in the northern equatorial region in 1990 and
was studied both from the ground and with Hubble Space Telescope (Sánchez-Lavega et al.
1991; Beebe et al. 1992; Barnet et al. 1992; Westphal et al. 1992). The cloud tops of this storm
were convectively lofted to more than a scale height above the surrounding cloud deck, and the
resultant increase in cloud optical depth of Saturn’s equatorial region persisted for several years
after the outbreak.
More recently, a major storm outbreak occurred in the northern midlatitudes. It was first
detected through ground-based observations on December 5, 2010, at a planetographic latitude
of 38○and, within the span of 1 week, expanded to a linear size of ∼8,000 km (Sánchez-Lavega
et al. 2011). This time, the Cassini spacecraft was wellpositioned in its orbit around Saturn
to study the storm and its evolution with its imaging and spectroscopic instrument suite.
>Figure 5-17 shows the storm as imaged by Cassini’s Imaging Science Subsystem roughly 2.5
months after the storm was first detected. Thermal infrared imaging and spectroscopy revealed
that this storm penetrated vertically well into Saturn’s stratosphere, which resulted in heating
as the material fell back onto Saturn’s upper atmosphere (Fletcher et al. 2011). Outbreaks such
as these provide a unique opportunity to study the zonal wind structure and vertical energy
transport in Saturn’s atmosphere.

Subsystem wide-angle camera on February 25, 2011 (Image courtesy of NASA)
3.2.3 Uranus and Neptune
When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986 during southern summer solstice, the planet lacked
significant storm clouds and atmospheric features. Only through a radical adjustment of image
contrast and dynamic range could several faint storm systems be discerned in the Voyager 2
data. However, over the past decade the atmosphere of Uranus has become much more active,
now revealing numerous short-lived convective storm features. The cause of these changes is not
entirely clear, although seasonal variation in insolation is likely a significant factor. Since Uranus
reached equinox in December 2007, over the past decade its northern hemisphere began to
receive direct sunlight after a period of several decades in darkness.
The application of new technologies to the study of Uranus’ atmosphere also aided in the
detection of new small storm features. The Keck telescopes, equipped with adaptive optics sys-
tem, have enabled diffraction-limited imaging of Uranus in the nearIR, where the contrast
between convective storm features and the methane clouds is greatest. The Hubble Space Tele-
scope has also provided high spatial resolution imagery of the Uranian atmosphere from optical
through near-IR wavelengths, including the first detection of a dark spot on Uranus in 2006
(Hammel et al. 2009). A large bright complex of clouds was seen to migrate in latitude with
an inertial oscillation superimposed on the zonal flow (Sromovsky et al. 2007), and another
long-lasting southern feature migrated toward the equator, where it met its eventual demise

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets
⊡Fig. 5-18
Image of Neptune taken by the Voyager 2 narrow-angle camera on August 16 and 17, 1989 (Image

(de Pater et al. 2011). These interactions hint at a coupling between giant planet zonal circula-
tion and convective motion, which should be explored further as the planet moves toward its
next solstice.
Neptune’s atmosphere has demonstrated convective activity regularly since the time of the
Voyager 2 encounter in 1989. A large disturbance dubbed the Great Dark Spot was seen in
Voyager 2 imagery (>Fig. 5-18), but this disturbance along with its accompanying white clouds
did not persist for decades; they were gone by the time HST observed Neptune in 1994 (Hammel
et al. 1995). Neptune is also expected to undergo seasonal variations due to its nonzero axial
tilt, and continued observations over the next several years will likely reveal new features and
changes in zonal wind structure due to its slowly varying insolation.

Atmospheric Chemistry
The distribution of chemical species in the atmospheres of the giant planets is governed by
several different processes depending on altitude. In the troposphere, where the temperature
gradient is negative, convection is the dominant means of energy transport. Species transport

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets 5
245
is relatively rapid; molecules that are formed at depth through thermochemical equilibrium
reactions and condensation can be lofted to altitudes where their interactions with ultraviolet
sunlight can change their properties. An example of this kind of reaction is the proposed “tan-
ning” of ammonia ice particles by solar UV radiation after they have been transported vertically
from deeper in the atmosphere (discussed above as a proposed mechanism for the coloration
of Jupiter’s reddish clouds).
In the stratosphere, above the temperatureminimum, the temperaturegradients in the giant
planets are positive and/or isothermal, which inhibits vertical motions and results in slow verti-
cal transport of species. In this case, photochemical disequilibrium processes play a significant
role in determining the composition of the giant planet stratospheres. For example, gaseous
methane in Jupiter’s atmosphere undergoes photochemical reactions to produce hydrocarbons
such as ethane (CH), acetylene (CH), and ethylene (CH).
4.1 Energy Balance
The temperatures in the stratospheres of the giant planets can be derived using both indirect
and direct techniques. A commonly used indirect method is the observation of occultations.
An atmospheric occultation is where the attenuation of a source, such as a background star or
a spacecraft radio signal, is observed as the planetary atmosphere passes in front of (or occults)
the source. Atmospheric occultations provide measurements of the density structure of an
atmosphere through the inversion of the observed light curves. From the density information,
a temperature profile can be inferred. This indirect method of obtaining stratospheric temper-
atures was highly effective for obtaining temperature profiles of all four giant planets during
the Voyager missions (shown in >Fig. 5-5). Stellar occultations continue to be employed by
orbiters (e.g., Cassini) and ground-based observers as a means of exploring temporal and spatial
variations in the atmospheric temperature structure of the giant planets.
Temperatures in the giant planet stratospheres can also be obtained through observations
of emission spectra in both the UV and IR spectral regimes. Such observations reveal that the
stratospherictemperatures ofthe giant planets are remarkablyuniform with latitude, which sug-
gests that the meridional transport of radiation at these altitudes is very efficient. The energy
balance of the giant planet stratospheres is controlled by the heating and cooling by photo-
chemically produced species. For example, on Jupiter, ethane emission is the dominant cooling
mechanism between pressures of ∼0.2 and 20 mbar.
4.2 Case Study: Shoemaker-Levy 9 Impacts on Jupiter
Photochemical models indicate that methane photochemistry dominates the production of
hydrocarbons in the giant planet stratospheres. Yet the detection of some species, such as HO
and CO, cannot be explained through traditional photochemical pathways, suggesting that the
source of these materials must be exogenic. Delivery mechanisms such as comets and interplan-
etary dust particles have been suggested as a means of supplying the giant planet stratospheres
with these molecules (Moses et al. 2000 and references therein).
In 1994, planetary scientists worldwide had a unique opportunity to view such a deliv-
ery event in real time. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which had passed close enough to Jupiter
in 1992 to be broken up into 22 fragments, impacted Jupiter between July 16 and 22, 1994.

246 5
Atmospheres of Jovian Planets
Observations of these impacts were made with all available ground-based and space-based tele-
scopic assets, including HST and Galileo, which resulted in new insight concerning cometary
structure and composition, ballistic impact physics, and Jupiter’s atmospheric response to these
impacts. The temporal evolution of the particulates associated with each impact confirmed
the decay of Jupiter’s zonal winds with height, while the spectroscopic measurements con-
firmed that cometary impacts are likely significant contributors to Jupiter’s stratospheric CO
budget (Lellouch et al. 1997). Although impact events such as this – where astronomers world-
wide had more than a year to prepare for their observations – are likely exceedingly rare, the
unique physics and chemistry probed by the SL9 impacts highlighted the importance of regular
monitoring observations, rapid response capabilities, follow-up observations, and international
coordinated efforts where possible.

Future Directions
5.1 Unanswered Questions
Fueled in part by the fantastic new discoveries made in the field of giant planet atmospheres
over the past several decades, numerous outstanding questions remain. In particular, we hope
that over the next few decades, progress will be made in addressing the following issues:
•
The water abundance in the atmospheres of the gas giants
•
The source of the coloration in the clouds of Jupiter
•
The linkage between the giant planets’ zonal circulations at the cloud-top level and the deep
abyssal circulation
•
The role that seasonally varying insolation plays in the vertical structure, cloud chemistry
and microphysics, and dynamics of giant planet atmospheres
Advances in understanding these issues can be made through additional observations as we
continue to push the instrumental limits of spectral grasp, spectral resolution, spatial resolu-
tion, and temporal coverage. Computational modeling of atmospheric dynamics on all scales,
ranging from the smallest vortices to the global circulations, will also be critical for advancing
the understanding of giant planet atmospheres.
5.2 Future Missions to the Outer Solar System
The Cassini spacecraft reached Saturn in 2004 and continues to provide magnificent views of
Saturn’s atmosphere. The nominal Cassini mission was scheduled to operate from 2004 to 2008.
Due to its extraordinary success, NASA extended it for two more years for the Cassini Equinox
mission (2008–2010). It was recently extended again for the Cassini Solstice mission and is
currently scheduled to operate in this third phase from 2010 to 2017. The second extension of
the Cassini mission will enable planetary astronomers to study the atmosphere of Saturn over
half of a year, from northern winter solstice to northern summer solstice, with unprecedented
detail. Seasonal changes in Saturn’s atmosphere are thought to be caused by the rings, which cast
shadows on the atmosphere and shield some of the planet from direct sunlight. The instruments
on board Cassini can asses seasonal changes in atmospheric temperatures, composition, and
dynamics, and further study new questions about Saturn’s atmosphere that arose during the

Atmospheres of Jovian Planets 5
247
Cassini Prime mission (e.g., looking for seasonal change in lightning activity rates or in the
structure of Saturn’s south polar vortex). The final 42 orbits of the 155-orbit Solstice mission
will be spent in the proximal orbit phase, where the orbit of the spacecraft will transition to
a more elliptical, polar orbit where the spacecraft regularly passes through Saturn’s ring plane.
This will enable the study of Saturn’s internal structure in a fashion analogous to the future Juno
mission to Jupiter and will enable a comparative study of the interiors of the two large gas giant
planets in our solar system.
The Juno mission to Jupiter was launched in August 2011 and will reach Jupiter in 2016,
at which point the spacecraft will enter a highly elliptical polar orbit. Juno will orbit Jupiter 32
times over the 15-month span of the mission; the instrument suite on board the spacecraft is
designed to provide new insight into Jupiter’s internal structure and global water abundance.
The internal mass distribution of the solar system’slargest planet will be determinedby precisely
mapping Jupiter’s gravitational field. Obtaining a better estimate for the mass of Jupiter’s core
will enable planetary scientists to distinguish between the two prevailing theories of giant planet
formation: whether Jupiter started with a massive core whose gravity attracted all of the nearby
gas or whether the planet formation was triggered by the collapse of an unstable region in the
protosolar nebula.
Knowledge of Jupiter’s deep water abundance is another key ingredient for solar system
and giant planet formation theories, as it has implications for the methods by which volatile
compounds were distributed throughout the solar system by icy planetesimals or protoplanets.
Juno will measure Jupiter’s deep water abundance with a microwave radiometer, which is sensi-
tive to emission coming from Jupiter’s atmosphere at depths much greater than those sounded
by the Galileo probe.
Jupiter’s polar magnetosphere and auroral emissions will be characterized for the first
time by Juno, using infrared and ultraviolet remote sensing instruments while simultaneously
directly sampling the charged particles and magnetic field near the poles. The entire magnetic
field of Jupiter will be mapped over the course of the mission, which will provide an indication
of how deep in the planet the magnetic field is generated and will yield new insight into dynamo
physics.
The European Space Agency (ESA) recently announced the selection of the Jupiter Icy
Moons Explorer, or JUICE mission, for launch early in the next decade. This will be an orbiter
whose primary objective will be to study Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto, the large icy satel-
lites of Jupiter. Although the science objectives are focused on satellites,observations of Jupiter’s
atmosphere would also be possible and would provide new insight into the structure and
dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere. Assuming a somewhat standard instrument suite of a
wide- and narrow-angle camera, a visible-infrared spectrometer, a thermal infrared and/or
ultraviolet spectrometer, and a submillimeter or microwave sounder, this mission may be
able to characterize the abundances of minor species (particularly ammonia and water) in
Jupiter’s troposphere and stratosphere, which has implications for the origin and evolution of
giant planet atmospheres. The Jovian atmospheric dynamics and structure also can be char-
acterized through studies of winds, cloud features, atmospheric waves, and tropospheric and
stratospheric temperatures.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is scheduled to be launched in the
next decade, will provide unprecedented infrared observations of Uranus and Neptune. Both
Jupiter and Saturn may be too bright to be observed with JWST in its standard imaging and
spectroscopic modes, although perhaps through clever techniques such as binning and/or
subframing new observations of the gas giant atmospheres will be possible. The spectral
coverage afforded by JWST extends that of HST into the infrared, and its 6.5-m diameter

primary mirror will offer a significant increase in spatial resolution over the infrared Spitzer
Space Telescope. Through observations of the ethane, methane, and acetylene emissions in the
stratospheres of Uranus and Neptune, we will gain an improved understanding of the heating
mechanisms in ice giant atmospheres.
Finally, there are several giant planet missions that were recommended as part of the
National Academy of Sciences planetary science decadal survey entitled Vision and Voyages
for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013–2022. This new decadal survey identifies the most
important scientific questions in planetary science and provides a prioritized list of flight inves-
tigations that can address these fundamental science questions. After the top priority Mars
sample return flagship mission, two outer solar system missions were recommended as second
and third priorities for flagships in the next decade: a EuropaJupiter mission and a Uranus sys-
tem. The decadal survey also recommended five possible missions for the New Frontiers class,
including a shallow Saturn probe mission that will yield fundamental new insight into Saturn’s
atmospheric structure and water abundance.
5.3 Links to Exoplanets
Over the last 15 years, the study of giant planets has been completely revolutionized by the
discovery of hundreds of large (Jupiter-sized or larger) extrasolar planets. These planets, many
of which orbit their host stars at distances closer than 1 AU, have forced a reexamination of old
ideas of giant planet formation and evolution. A deeper understanding of our own solar system
and its evolution since the time of formation is critical for understanding these exciting, newly

Planetary Magnetospheres
Abstract:
The nature of interaction between a planetary object and the surrounding plasma
depends on the properties of both the object and the plasma flow in which it is embedded.
A planet with a significant internal magnetic field forms a magnetosphere that extends the
planet’s influence beyond its surface or cloud tops. There are seven objects in the solar system
that presentlyhave internallygenerated magneticfields: Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, and the satellite Ganymede. A planetary object without a significant internal dynamo
can interact with any plasma flowing past via remanent magnetization of the crust and/or cur-
rents associated with local ionization or induced in an electrically conducting ionosphere or
layer of water. Venus, Mars, Titan, Io, Enceladus, and Europa have strong interactions with
their surroundings. Planetary magnetospheres span a wide range of sizes but involve similar
basic principles and processes.

Introduction
As the name suggests, a planet’s magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by the planet’s
magnetic field. The nature of the interaction between a planetary object and the surrounding
plasma depends on the properties of both the object and the plasma flow in which it is embed-
ded. A planet with a significant internal magnetic field forms a magnetosphere that extends the
planet’s influence beyond its surface or cloud tops. A planetary object without a significant inter-
nal dynamo can interact with any surrounding plasma via remanent magnetization of the crust
and/or currents induced in an electrically conducting ionosphere or layer of water. >Figure 6-1
is a schematic of the archetypical magnetosphere of Earth, illustrating the general anatomy.
All solar system objects are embedded in the solar wind that streams radially away from
the Sun. The flow speed of the solar wind exceeds the speed of the fastest wave mode that can
propagate in the interplanetaryplasma. The interaction ofthe supersonicsolarwind with a plan-
etary magnetic field (either generated by an internal dynamo or induced externally) produces
a bow shock upstream of the planet. Behind the bow shock, the subsonic wind – the magne-
tosheath – is deflected around the magnetospheric obstacle. The magnetospheric boundary –
the magnetopause – was usually regarded to first order as an impenetrable boundary. However,
the amount of mass, momentum, and magnetic flux exchanged across the magnetopause has
become an active area of research at Earth and other magnetospheres. The distance between the
center of the planet and the magnetopause in the direction of the Sun (approximately the clos-
est distance) is labeled RMP, generally described in units of the planetary radius (RP). Whatever
the details of the interaction, in nearly all cases, the interaction region has a “wake” or “tail” –
the magnetotail – that can extend for several hundred times RMP downstream in the solar wind.
Venus, Mars, and (likely) Pluto do not have dynamos generating an internal field at present,
though strong remanant magnetization of crustal rocks is evidence that Mars certainly had a
dynamo in the past and this is also quite possible for Venus too. At present, the solar wind

Anatomy of a magnetosphere, applied here to Earth
interacts with the substantial ionospheres of these planets, induction currents deflecting the
bulk of the flow around the planet, acting as the obstacle to the supersonic solar wind, and
producing an upstream bow shock. Any neutral atoms or molecules escaping from planetary
atmospheres often become ionized either by solar photons or charge exchange with solar wind
protons. These atmospheric ions are then entrained in and extract momentum from the solar
wind. The slowing ofthe solarwind around these obstacles carries the Sun’s magneticfield which
is then temporarily draped around the planet and stretched back into a comet-like tail.
Objects such as the Earth’s Moon that have no appreciable atmosphere and a low-
conductivity surface have minimal electrodynamic interaction with the surrounding plasma
and just absorb the impinging solar wind with no upstream shock. Interactions between plane-
tary satellites and magnetospheric plasmas are as varied as the moons themselves: Ganymede’s
significant dynamo produces a mini-magnetosphere within the giant magnetosphere of Jupiter;
the electrodynamic interactions of magnetospheric plasma flowing past volcanically active Io
(Jupiter) and Enceladus (Saturn) generate substantial currents and supply extended clouds of
neutrals that become ionized to supply more plasma to the system; plasma interactions with
Titan’s thick atmosphere and substantial ionosphere are likened to Venus; in the absence of
an atmosphere, charged particles bombard the moon surfaces, sometimes sputtering signifi-
cant exospheres (e.g., Europa, Dione, Callisto). The flow within magnetospheres tends to be
subsonic, so that none of these varied interactions forms a shock upstream of the moon.
Reviews of planetary magnetospheres range in their approach to the subject from consid-
ering it a topic in space plasma physics (exploiting the range of planetary environments as a
laboratory to explore space plasmas) to a branch of planetary science (presenting the space

environment as a component in understanding the planetary objects). A basic, qualitative
introduction is given in van Allen and Bagenal (1999). Deeper studies of comparative mag-
netospheres range from the abstract to the specific (Siscoe 1979; Vasyli¯unas 2004; Vasyliunas
2009, 2010; Kivelson 2007; Walker and Russell 1995; Bagenal 1992; Russell 2004, 2006; Kivel-
son and Bagenal 2007; Bagenal 2009). This chapter takes an intermediate path, with the goal of
applying the general principles to specific planets but also providing a qualitative appreciation
of the different characters of our local family of magnetospheres.
The general principles of the structure and dynamics of planetary magnetospheres are pre-
sented in >Sect. 2. The Earth is the nominal case with which to compare the basic properties
between the planets. >Section 3 introduces the magnetospheres of the outer planets, magne-
tospheres that are large, dominated by rotation, and strongly influenced by the moons that are
embedded within. By contrast, >Sect. 4 discusses the mini-magnetospheres of Mercury and
Ganymede. >Section 5 returns to plasma interactions with nonmagnetized objects where the
varied plasma interactions with planets such as Venus, Mars, and Pluto are discussed, as well as
moons Titan, Io, Enceladus, and Europa.

Magnetospheric Principles
The interaction of a planetary object with its surroundings depends on the properties of both the
planetary body and the impinging plasma. For the nine major planetary bodies, >Table 6-1 lists
the properties of the interplanetary medium (the strength and direction of the interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) and the speed, density, and temperature of the solar wind), as well as
the strength of any planetary magnetic field, the planetary rotation rate, and the scale of the
observed magnetospheres. In >Table 6-2, the properties of the planetary dynamos are listed:
the strength and direction of the planet’s magnetic field and the direction of the planet’s spin.
Below, how these properties affect the characteristics and behavior of planetary magnetospheres
is discussed.
2.1 Planetary Magnetic Fields
Spacecraft carrying magnetometers have flown to and characterized the magnetic fields of all
the planets except (dwarf) Pluto. All four of the giant planets have strong magnetic fields. The
smaller terrestrial planets have weaker fields, Mercury’s being much weaker than Earth’s. The
upper limit on an internally-generated field of Venus is less than 10−times Earth’s magnetic
moment. While strong magnetization of surface rocks show that Mars’ internal dynamo was
active in the past, geological evidence shows that the dynamo shut down around 4 billion
years ago.
The history of space exploration of planetary magnetism is given by Ness (2010), while
Balogh (2010) reviews techniques that have been employed to measure planetary magnetic
fields. Thorough reviews of planetary magnetic field observations and their analysis are pre-
sented for all planets by Connerney (2007) and for the giant planets by Russell and Dougherty
(2010). Anderson et al. (2010, 2011) present recent determinations of Mercury’s magnetic
field from the MESSENGER spacecraft. Magnetic field measurements from orbit allow the
separation of the internally generated field from the effects of external currents in the mag-
netosphere (see review by Olsen et al. 2010 of the techniques for doing this).

As planetary magnetic field measurements are improved (in coverage, accuracy, and prox-
imity to the planet), they tend to show increasing complexity. The standard technique is to
describe the internal magnetic field as a sum of multipoles or spherical harmonics (e.g., Walker
and Russell 1995; Connerney 1993, 2007; Merrill et al. 1996), the higher orders being functions
that drop off increasingly rapidly with distance so that one needs to get very close to the planet
to see any effects of these high-order multipoles. The amplitude of each multipole is derived
by fitting magnetic field observations obtained by magnetometers on spacecraft flying past the
planet (e.g., Connerney 1981; Russell and Dougherty 2010). The extensive coverage provided
by surface explorers over the centuries and afforded by low-orbiting spacecraft at Earth in the
past 50 years not only allows the present Earth’s field to be described with hundreds of terms
but also allows description of the variation of the Earth’s field over time (e.g., reviewed by Hulot
et al. 2010). Moreover, paleomagnetic data extend the Earth’s record back in geological time,
revealing many polarity reversals of the magnetic field. By contrast, the sampling of planetary
magnetic fields is too poor to determine any temporal variation over the few decades of space
exploration, and currently there is no evidence of whether other planetary dynamos reverse
polarity.
For magnetospheric purposes, where one is relatively far from the planet, a simple dipole
description (equivalent to a bar magnetic placed inside the planet) has proved to be very valu-
able. The formula for a dipole magnetic field vector (measured in units of Tesla) B as a function
of position vector r is
B = [r(M⋅r) −Mr]/r,
(6.1)
where M is the planetary magnetic moment (in units of T m). It is easier to understand this
vector field if one looks at the components (Br, Bθ,Bϕ) in a spherical coordinate system (r, θ, ϕ),
centered and aligned with the dipole. For a dipole centered on the planet, the field is azimuthally
symmetric and Bϕ = , while the other components are
Br = Bocos θ/R
(6.2)
Bθ = Bosin θ/R
(6.3)
∣B∣= Bo(+ cosθ)//R
.
(6.4)
where Bo is the value of the magnetic field at the equator, R = ∣r∣/RP, and θ is colatitude. Note
that the field strength at the poles (θ = ) is twice that at the equator, Bo.
The planetary magnetic fields are generally not aligned with the planet’s spin axis. Thus,
the simplest description is often a dipole that is offset from the center of the planet and tilted.
>Figure 6-2 illustrates the offset, tilted dipole (OTD) that approximates planetary fields and the
values are given in >Table 6-2. Except for Uranus and Neptune, the tilts are modest (<10○) and
the offset a small fraction of a planetary radius. The large tilts and offsets of Uranus’ and Nep-
tune’s magnetic fields indicate the highly non-dipolar nature of these fields. Further indication
of deviation of the true magnetic field from the simplicity of centered dipole is illustrated by the
ratioofmaximum tominimum surface field strength being much largerthan value of2 expected
for a centered dipole. The range of complexities from Saturn’s highly symmetric, dipolar field to
the irregular fields of Uranus and Neptune are illustrated in the surface maps of magnetic field
strength shown in >Fig. 6-3 and the high values of the max/min ratio in >Table 6-2.

Considering the horizontal direction of the diagram to be parallel to the ecliptic plane and the
vertical direction the ecliptic normal, then the spin axis is shown for conditions of maximum angle
from the ecliptic normal (i.e., at solstice). Each planet’s magnetic ﬁeld can be approximated as a
dipole where the orientation and any oﬀset from the center of the planet is illustrated by a bar
magnet located at the center of the planet
While the theory of planetary dynamos has yet to reach the level of sophistication where it
could predict with accuracy the presence (let alone the specific characteristics) of an internally
generated magnetic field, it is generally understood that, for such a field to be present, planets
need to have an interior that is sufficiently electrically conducting and that is convecting with
sufficient vigor. Various simple scaling laws have been derived over the years (e.g., reviewed
by Christensen 2010) that relate the strength of the planet’s magnetic field to other properties,
but these laws seem to be more useful for testing theoretical ideas about dynamos than for pre-
dictions. Extensive geophysical measurements have revealed substantial information about the
distribution of density, temperature, and flows inside the Earth. Moreover, the remanent mag-
netization of surface rocks tells us how the Earth’s field has changed over geological time. These
geophysical data are powerful constraints on the geodynamo and numerical dynamo models are
beginning toshow consistent behavior(Christensen2010; Wicht and Tilgner2010). In addition,
laboratory experiments test ideas about parameters that control geodynamo behavior (Verhille
et al. 2010). Forotherplanetaryobjects, where information about the interiorproperties is much
more limited, the presence or absence of a magnetic field is an important constraint on the inte-
rior conditions. Dynamo models are now being developed that vary the size of the planetary
core, rotation rate,conductivity, heat flux, etc., to matchthe wide range of conditions at different
planets (reviewed by Stanley and Glatzmaier 2010).

and Holme and Bloxham (1996) for Uranus and Neptune. Based on Stanley and Bloxham (2006))
Given the disparity in scale between the giant and terrestrial planets (e.g., the volume
of Jupiter is 1,400 times that of the Earth), it is perhaps not surprising that the four terres-
trial planets have far weaker magnetic fields generated in their interiors than the giant planets
(Russell 1993; Connerney 1993; Stevenson 2003; Breuer et al. 2010). The iron cores are poten-
tial dynamo regions of terrestrial planets. The high pressures inside the giant planets Jupiter and
Saturn put the hydrogen into a phase where it has the electrical conductivity of liquid metal (see
>Chap. 4). Jupiter’s three times higher mass than Saturn produces a much larger volume of
metallic hydrogen, responsible for ∼×20 times stronger dynamo. Inside Uranus and Neptune,
the pressures are too weak to make hydrogen metallic, and it is postulated that their dynamos
must be generated in regions of liquid water where, as in Earth’s ocean, small concentrations
of ions provide sufficient conductivity. Stanley and Bloxham (2006) show that confining the
dynamos of these water giants to a relatively thin conducting shell can produce highly irregular,
non-dipolar magnetic fields.

Careful analysis by Phillips and Russell (1987) produced an upper limit to Venus’ magnetic
moment of ∼× −ME and revealed no evidence of crustal remanent magnetization. The
apparent lack of an active dynamo inside Venus puts interesting constraints on the thermal
evolution of that planet (Stevenson et al. 1983; Schubert et al. 1988). A common misconception
is that it is the slowness of the rotation of Venus that prevents a dynamo. In fact, very little
rotation is needed for a dynamo, and all objects in the solar system have sufficient rotation
(Stevenson 2003). So, the question becomes why is Venus’ core not convecting? Stevenson et al.
(1983) proposed that Venus’ core temperatureis too high for a solid iron inner core to condense
(the differentiation of solid iron from an outer liquid sulfur–iron alloy drives Earth’s dynamo).
The lack of plate tectonics at Venus may be limiting the cooling of the planet’s upper layers,
further suppressing internal convection. Another possibility is that Venus may be in a state of
transition following the period of global volcanism that resurfaced the planet about 700 million
years ago (see
>Chap. 3). Thus, Venus might have had an active dynamo in the past and may
well develop one in the future. Why neighbor twin planets should have suffered such different
internal histories is a major mystery of planetary geophysics (Smrekar et al. 2007).
Measurements of strong remanent crustal magnetism (surface fields of up to 1,500 nT) sug-
gest that Mars has had an active dynamo and experienced changes in polarity over geological
time scales (Acuña et al. 2001; Connerney et al. 2004) but stopped generating an internal field
some 4 billion years ago. Stevenson (2010) summarizes the three main contending theories of
how Mars’ dynamo operated for a few hundred million years and then ceased: (1) cooling of
the core slowed down to the point where conductive heat loss dominated, without an inner core
forming (Stevenson et al. 1983); (2) Nimmo and Stevenson (2000) suggest that after a period of
efficient convection (perhaps driven by plate tectonics), Mars underwent a change in convective
style to the currently observed stagnant lid mode, causing the mantle and core to stop cooling
and turning off core convection and the dynamo (note that this model would work irrespective
of whether Mars has an inner core); or (3) the inner core of Mars froze sufficiently so that the
remaining fluid region of the outer core was too thin to sustain a dynamo (Stewart et al. 2007).
These theories span a wide range of states of the core of Mars. Future geophysical sounding (in
particular, seismology) will hopefully reveal the state of Mars’ interior.
Having radii of ∼40% of the Earth’s radius, Mercury and Ganymede were originally expected
to have cooled off, shutting down any internal dynamo. But spacecraft flybys showed each object
to have a significant magnetic field. Thermal models of the particularly large iron core (>70%
of the radius) of Mercury suggest that at least an outer region is likely to be liquid and possibly
convecting. However, the observed field is much weaker than standard dynamo theory would
predict (Stevenson 2003). Efforts to reconcile models of thermal evolution (Breuer et al. 2010)
and dynamo models (Stanley and Glatzmaier 2010) of these small bodies is an active area of
research.
2.2 Scales of Planetary Magnetospheres
The term “magnetosphere” was coined by Gold (1959) to describe “the region above the iono-
sphere in which the magnetic field has dominant control over the motions of gas and fast
charged particles.” > Figure 6-1 presents a schematic of the Earth’s magnetosphere showing
the major regions.

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
261
Planetary magnetospheres are embedded in the solar wind, which is the outward expansion
of the solar corona. At the Earth’s orbit, the solar wind has an average speed of about 400 km/s.
The density of particles (mainly electrons and protons with a few percent alpha particles) is
observed to decrease (from values of about 3–10 cm−at Earth) as the inverse square of the
distance from the Sun, consistent with a steady radial expansion of solar gas into a spherical
volume. The solar wind speed, while varying between 300 and 700 km/s, always greatly exceeds
the speed of waves characteristic of a low density, ionized, and magnetized gas (Alfven waves).
The planetary bow shock formed upstream of an obstacle in the super-Alfvenic solar wind flow
can be described in fluid terms as a discontinuity in bulk parameters of the solar wind plasma
in which mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. Entropy, however, increases as the flow
traverses the shock with the solar wind being decelerated and heated so that the flow can be
deflected around the magnetosphere.Thus, a shock requires dissipative processes, and the pres-
ence of a magneticfield allows dissipation to occur on a scale much smaller than the scale length
for collisions between solar wind particles. Although planetary bow shocks do not play a signif-
icant role in processes occurring inside the magnetosphere, the crossings of spacecraft through
planetary bow shocks have provided an opportunity to study the exotic plasma physics of high
Mach number collisionless shocks that cannot be produced in the laboratory (see reviews by
Lembege et al. 2004; Balogh et al. 2005; Treumann 2009).
Well before (Biermann 1957) provided cometary evidence of a persistent solar wind,
Chapman and Ferraro (1930) considered how a strongly magnetized body would deflect a flow
of particles from the Sun. They estimated the location of the stagnation point where the dynamic
pressure of the solar wind (ρswVsw) is balanced by the internal pressure of the planet’s mag-
netic field (treating the boundary as impenetrable and ignoring any contributions to internal
pressure from particles). > Equation 6.4 shows that the dipole field strength as a function of
radial distance (in the equatorial plane) is
B(r) = Bo(RP/r)
(6.5)
so that the planetary magnetic pressure varies as
B/μo = (B
o/μo)(RP/r).
(6.6)
For the case of a dipolar magnetic field (with poles perpendicular to the solar wind direction),
the Chapman-Ferraro stagnation distance RCF is
RCF = ξ(B
o/μoρswVsw
)/,
(6.7)
where ξ is a numerical factor that corrects for the effects of electrical currents that flow along
the magnetopause (discussed in textbooks such as Cravens 1997; Kivelson and Russell 1995).
Some prefer to define RCF with ξ = ()/(e.g., Vasyliunas 2009). Empirically, ξ is found to
be about a factor of 1.4 to be consistent with the actual distance of the subsolar magnetopause
distance (RMP) at Earth (Walker and Russell 1995).
>Table 6-1 shows that RCF is a reasonable approximation to the observed magnetospheric
scale RMP except in the case of Jupiter (and a lesser extent Saturn), where substantial plasma
pressure inside the magnetosphere expands the magnetopause to roughly twice the standoff
distance of a dipole (discussed in > Sect. 2.4.1). > Figure 6-4 illustrates the huge range in
scale of the planetary magnetospheres. The magnetospheres of the giant planets encompass
most of their extensive moon systems, including the four Galilean moons of Jupiter as well as
Titan (Saturn) and Triton (Neptune). Earth’s Moon, however, resides almost entirely outside

magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn are shown by zig-zag lines
the magnetosphere, spending less than 5% of its orbit crossing the magnetotail. >Figure 6-5
illustrates the vast range in scales: Each magnetosphere fits into the volume of the next-larger
planet. Earth tends to be considered as the standard of comparison for other magnetospheres.
It is natural that our home planet’s magnetosphere is better explored and its vicissitudes studied
in detail, but it is also important to test our understanding of the magnetospheric principles
derived at Earth by applying these concepts to other planets.
Finally, when we discuss the dynamics of magnetospheres, it will be clear that an important
factor is the orientation of the planet’s magnetic field relative to the interplanetary magnetic field
(>Table 6-2). The obliquity is the angle of the planet’s spin axis relative to the ecliptic plane nor-
mal. As a planet orbits the Sun, if it has a large obliquity, it will experience not only large seasonal
changes but also a wide range in angles between the upstream solar wind (and embedded IMF)
and the planet’s magnetic field. Moreover, the large tilt of Uranus’ and Neptune’s magnetic fields
with respect to their spin axes means that these magnetospheres also see a modulation of this
solarwind angle overtheirspin period (i.e., a planetaryday). While the solarwind remains flow-
ing within a few degrees of radial from the Sun, the IMF forms a spiral of increasingly tangential
field. At Earth the average spiral angle is 45○, at Jupiter it averages 80○, and at farther planets the
field is basically tangential to the planet’s orbit. The polarity changes several times during the
∼25-day solar rotation (more frequently during solar maximum). Important for the influence of
the solar wind on magnetospheric dynamics are the variations in the north–south component
of the IMF (which fluctuates about the ecliptic plane) and changes in solar wind ram pressure

Scaling of the magnetospheres from Mercury, Earth, Saturn, to Jupiter
impacting the magnetosphere. Other factors such as the Alfven Mach number of the incoming
solar wind and plasma pressure on either side of the magnetopausealso play roles that are being
explored in current research (La Belle-Hamer et al. 1995; Swisdak et al. 2003; Cassak and Shay
2011).
2.3 Plasma Sources
The plasma found in a planetary magnetosphere could have a variety of sources: it could have
leaked across the magnetopause from the solar wind, it may have escaped the planet’s gravity
and flowed out of the ionosphere, or it may be the result of the ionization of neutral material
coming from satellites or rings embedded in the magnetosphere. The study of the origin of
plasma populations and their evolution as they move through the magnetosphere is a detective
story that becomes more complex the deeper one delves (e.g., review of Earth’s plasma sources
by Moore and Horwitz 2007).
The clearest indicator of which source is responsible for a particular planet’s magnetospheric
plasma is chemical composition (>Table 6-3). For example, the O+ ions in the Earth’s magne-
tosphere must surely have come from the ionosphere, and the sulfur and oxygen ions at Jupiter
have an obvious origin in Io’s volcanic gases. But the source of protons is not so clear – protons
could be either ionospheric (particularly for the hydrogen-dominated gas giants), dissociation
of water ejected from icy satellites, or from the solar wind. One might consider that a useful
source diagnostic would be the abundance of helium ions. Emanating from the hot (millions

of kelvins, a few hundred eV) solar corona, helium in the solar wind is fully ionized as He++
ions and comprises ∼3–5% of the number density. Ionospheric plasma is much cooler (thou-
sands of kelvins, <0.1 eV), so that ionospheric helium ions are mostly singly ionized. Thus, a
measurement of the abundance ratios He++/H+ and He+/H+ would clearly distinguish the rel-
ative importance of these sources. Unfortunately, measuring the composition to such a level of
detail is difficult for the bulk of the plasma, with energies in the range 1 eV–1 keV (e.g., Young
1997a, b, 1998). Measurement of composition is more feasible at higher energies, but then one
needs to consider whether the process that has accelerated the ions within the magnetosphere,
since they left the source region, is mass or charge dependent.
The temperature of a plasma can also be an indicator of its origin. Plasma in the ionosphere
has characteristic temperatures of <0.1 eV; the ionization of neutral gases produces ions with
energies associated with the local plasma flow speed, while material that has leaked in from
the solar wind tends to have energies of a few keV. But, again, we need to consider carefully
how a parcel of plasma may have heated or cooled as it moved through the magnetosphere to
the location at which it is measured. >Figure 6-6 illustrates various ways in which ionospheric
plasma entersthe Earth’s magnetosphereand evolves by different processes. As we explore other
magnetospheres, we should expect similar levels of complexity.
> Table 6-3 summarizes the main plasma characteristics of the six planetary magne-
tospheres. To a first approximation, one can say that escape of material from the satellites
dominates the magnetospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, with ionospheric sources
being secondary. Uranus having fewer, smaller, satellites; its weak ionospheric source probably
supplies the main contribution. With only the most tenuous of exospheres, Mercury’s magne-
tosphere contains mostly solar wind material, but energetic particle and photon bombardment
of the surface may be a significant source of O+, Na+, K+, Mg+, etc. (Slavin 2004). At Earth,
the net sources from the solar wind and ionosphere are probably comparable, though the most
recent studies suggest that the ionospheric contribution seems to be dominant (e.g., Moore and
Horwitz 2007).

2.4 Plasma Dynamics
First we describe how charged particles move in response to specified electric E and magnetic
B fields. Depending on the situation, a range of approaches can be taken, from treating each
particle separately to regarding the plasma as a magnetized fluid, plus hybrid approaches in
between. The particle approach is usually appropriate for very energetic particles (e.g., trapped
in radiation belts). To model plasma behavior over larger spatial and temporal scales (e.g., global
magnetospheric models), it is generally appropriate to use magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
Then there are some situations where electrons can be treated as a fluid but ions need to be
treated as particles (e.g., in modeling the interaction with some of the satellites). The basic
physics of space plasmas is described in textbooks such as Kivelson and Russell (1995), Gurnett
and Bhattacharjee (2005), Gombosi (1998), or Cravens (1997).
After describing the motions of energetic particles in dipole magnetic fields close to the
planet, the radiation belts of the major magnetospheresare compared and their properties listed
in >Table 6-4. Moving farther away from the planet, the magnetic field becomes weaker and
can be modified from a simple dipole by electrical currents flowing through the plasma. The-
oretical ideas are applied to the different planetary magnetospheres to determine where and
when plasma flows are predominantly rotation with the planet vs. controlled by the interaction
of the solar wind with the magnetosphere. >Table 6-5 lists various dynamical parameters of
the different planetary magnetospheres that quantify the relative importance of rotational vs.
solar wind influences in each case.
When comparing the dynamics of different magnetospheres, the traditional approach has
been to compare electric fields and electric currents (i.e., E, J). Over the past decade, the case
has been made (Parker 2007; Vasyli¯unas 2001, 2011) that such an “electrical circuit” approach
is only valid for quasi-static situations (specifically, where temporal changes occur over time
scales that are long compared with the transit time of Alfven waves across the system) and that
one should derive the flows and magnetic fields (B, v) resulting from the various stresses on
the system. This review presents the traditional (E, J) approach partly because it is the one that
dominates the current literature but also because it is perhaps easier to explain the interactions
between different components of a complex system.

2.4.1 Energetic Particles and Radiation Belts
A particle with charge q, mass m, and velocity v in an electric field E and magnetic field B
experiences a Lorentz force which causes the particle to accelerate
F = q(E + v × B) = mdv/dt,
(6.8)
Solving ( > 6.8) is relatively straightforward if E and B are specified. For the case of a dipole
magnetic field, charged particles exhibit motions on three temporal and spatial scales, as illus-
trated in >Fig. 6-7a. On the shortest time scale, particles gyrate about the magnetic field with
a gyroradius of
Rg = mv/qB,
(6.9)
where v is the speed of the particle perpendicular to the magnetic field. Positively and nega-
tively charged particles gyrate in opposite directions. As a particle moves along the magnetic
field, it experiences stronger magnetic field as it approaches the poles. In stronger fields, the
gyromotion is increased and, through conservation of total energy, the particle motion along
the field decreases. Thus, the particle is trapped and “bounces” between polarregions ofstronger
fields. On longer time scales, the particles experience drifts around the planet (> Fig. 6-7a)
producing a “belt” of trapped particles.
The particle source and loss processes act on much longer time scales (hours–years at
Earth, months–years at Jupiter). Radial (cross-field) motions are diffusive – mostly scattering
by small-scale perturbations in the magnetic field. Ultimately, the particles eventually escape

(CRAND, whereby neutrons generated by cosmic rays bombarding the atmosphere decay to
produce protons and electrons) and are confined closer to the planet. The lower energy parti-
cles (10s–100s KeV, right of >Fig. 6-7b) are “injected” into the inner magnetosphere from the

magnetotail during magnetic storms, dominate the particle energy density, and carry the ring
current. Luckily, the most useful orbits for satellites (low Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit
at 6.6 REarth) generally avoid the radiation belts, but at times of high geomagnetic activity, sen-
sitive electronics as well as astronauts can be exposed to significant fluxes of damaging energetic
particles.
As the discovery of Earth’s radiation belts marked the dawn of the space age, the nearly
simultaneous detection of radio emission from Jupiter in the late 1950s started the explo-
ration of the jovian magnetosphere. The radiation belts of Jupiter have been observed via radio
emission from MeV electrons which generateintense synchrotron emission at decimetric wave-
lengths observed from Earth-based radio telescopes as well as by the Cassini spacecraft on its
way to Saturn (see the review by Bolton et al. 2004). >Figure 6-7c shows the distribution of
energetic electron fluxes at 10, 20, and 40 MeV derived from modeling emissions at different
wavelengths (Santos-Costa 2001). These high fluxes of energetic electrons (and the accompany-
ing energetic ions) provide a quick, lethal dose to sensitive electronics so that spacecraft aimed
close to Jupiter need to avoid and/or be protected against high radiation doses. Such a mission,
Juno, will go into polar orbit in the summer of 2016, skimming over Jupiter’s clouds and ducking
under the radiation belts.
The smaller physical scale and shorter time scales of the Saturn system result in less net
acceleration and weaker fluxes of energetic particles. Absorption by the majestic ring system
further prevents the buildup of comparable fluxes close to the planet, so that there are no belts
emitting synchrotron radiation at Saturn. Significant populations of energetic particles were
detected at Uranus and Neptune, but the fluxes were much lower than at Jupiter and Saturn.
It could be that the shorter residence times in these smaller magnetospheres limit the amount
of acceleration, or it may be much harder for particles to be stably trapped in such non-
dipolar fields. The trapped populations of energetic particles in the magnetospheres of the major
planets are compared by Cheng et al. (1987), Mauk et al. (1995), and Mauk and Fox (2010).
In the mini-magnetospheres of Ganymede and Mercury, the time scales for energetic particles
to drift around these objects are only minutes, suggesting that particles are not stably trapped
(see review by Kivelson 2007).
In the cases of all the giant planets, the observed high fluxes of energetic particles in the
middle magnetosphere and compositional evidence imply that some fraction of the thermal
plasma is accelerated to high energies, either by tapping the rotational energy of the planet (in
the cases of Jupiter and Saturn) or by processes in the non-dipolar fields of the tail (at Earth and
probably Uranus and Neptune). If the energy density of the energetic particle populations is
comparable to the magnetic field (i.e., β > where β = nkT/(B/μ), as shown in >Table 6-4
for Jupiter and Saturn), then particle pressures inflate and stretch out the magnetic field and
generate strong currents in the equatorial plasma disk. While Uranus and Neptune have sig-
nificant radiation belts, the energy density remains small compared with the magnetic field
(i.e., β ≪, see >Table 6-4).
>Figure 6-8 compares the magnetospheres of Mercury, Earth, Saturn, and Jupiter which are
scaled to the Chapman–Ferraro distance ( >Sect. 2.2) that assumes the internal plasma pressure
is negligible and that the planetary field is a dipole. >Figure 6-8 illustrates how the substantial
plasma pressure inside at Jupiter (and to a lesser extent at Saturn) expands the magnetosphere.
At Jupiter, the high plasma pressures in the plasma sheet dominatethe local magnetic field pres-
sure, producing values of β greater than unity beyond ∼RJ, increasing to greater than 100 at
45 RJ (Mauk et al. 2004). Not only does the plasma pressure dominate the magnetic pressure,
but the radial profile of plasma pressure is also considerably flatter than the R−/variation in

magnetospheres due to the signiﬁcant plasma pressure inside

the scale of Jupiter’s magnetosphere from the dipolar stand-off distance of ∼42 RJ to 65–90RJ.
A simple pressure balance between the ram pressure of the solar wind and the magnetic pres-
sure of a dipole produces a weak variation in the terrestrial dayside magnetopause distance
RMP for a solar wind density ρ and speed vsw such that RMP ∝(ρv

the magnetopause locations at Jupiter indicate a much stronger variation, RMP ∝(ρv

(Slavin et al. 1985; Huddleston et al. 1998; Joy et al. 2002; Alexeev and Belenkaya 2005). Con-
sequently, a factor 10 variation in ram pressure at Earth changes the magnetopause distance by
only 70%, while at Jupiter, the tenfold variations in solar wind pressure often observed at 5 AU
cause the dayside magnetopause to move between ∼100RJ and ∼50RJ. At Saturn, the plasma
pressures are less than Jupiter but the plasma beta is still greater than unity beyond 8 Rs (e.g.,
Sergis et al. 2010) and has values of 2–5 in the plasma sheet. The more modest values of beta at
Saturn are consistent with the magnetopause standoff distance varying as −1/5 power of solar
wind pressure, as found by Kanani et al. (2010).
2.4.2 Rotational Flows
Magnetospheric configuration is generally well described by MHD in which the magnetic field
can be considered frozen into the plasma flow. Thus, we need to consider the processes control-
ling magnetospheric flows. The two largest sources of momentum in planetary magnetospheres
are the planet’s rotation and the solar wind. The nature of large-scale circulation of material in
the magnetosphere depends on which momentum source is tapped. For planetary magneto-
spheres, corotation of plasma with the planet is a useful first approximation with any departures
from strict corotation occurring when certain conditions (described below) break down. It may
be helpful to think of plasma in the magnetosphere as mass that is coupled by means of magnetic
field lines to a giant flywheel (the planet) with the ionosphere (or magnetosphere just above)
acting as the clutch. >Figure 6-9 illustrates the dynamical process whereby the magnetospheric
plasma is coupled to the angular momentum of the spinning planet (for a detailed mathemati-
cal description and further references see Vasyliunas 1983). The region within a magnetosphere
where the flow is predominately rotational is called the plasmasphere.
For a magnetospheric plasma to rotate with the planet, the upper region of the neutral atmo-
sphere must corotate with the planet and be closely couple to the ionosphere by collisions. The
electrical conductivity of the ionosphere σ i is large so that in a corotating ionosphere (with
velocity V i), any horizontal currents (perpendicular to the local magnetic field) are given by
Ohm’s law
J
i = σ i(Ei + V i × B).
(6.10)
Just above the ionosphere where the conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field in the
(collision-free) magnetosphere, σ m is essentially zero and Em = −Vm×B. Because the plasma
particles are farmore mobile in the direction ofthe local magneticfield, the parallel conductivity
σ//
m
 is large and the field lines can be considered to be equipotentials (E•B= ). Thus, the
electric field in the magnetosphere can be mapped into the ionosphere (> Fig. 6-8a). Because
the ionosphere is relatively thin, the electric field Em just above the ionosphere is the same as
Ei so that we can write
J
i= σ i(V i −Vm) × B,
(6.11)
The condition for the corotation of the magnetospheric plasma is that the ratio Ji/σ i be
sufficiently small so that
Vm = V i = Ω × R.
(6.12)
The corotational electric field is therefore
Ecor = −(Ω × R) × Bplanet.
(6.13)

that this leads to the development of regions of high impedance at high latitudes

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
273
For a dipolar magnetic field that is aligned with the rotation axis, the corotational electric
field (in the equatorial plane, see >Fig. 6-9b) is radial with magnitude
Ecor = ΩBo/r.
(6.14)
It is clear that large ionospheric conductivities facilitate corotation. A large σ m
// also means
that any currents in the magnetosphere that result from mechanical stresses on the plasma are
directlycoupled byfield-aligned currents tothe ionosphere. Thus, corotation breaks down when
mechanical stresses on the magnetospheric plasma drive ionospheric currents that are suffi-
ciently large for the ratio Ji/σ i to become significant. Such conditions might occur in regions
where there are large increases in mass density due to local ionization of neutral material, where
there are strong radial motions of the plasma, or where external stresses begin to influence the
magnetospheric plasma. When the magnetosphere imposes too large a load, the ionospheric
clutch begins to slip.
The above argument, originally made by Brice and Ioannidis (1970), quantified by Hill
(1979), and reviewed by Vasyliunas (1983) and Mauk et al. (2009), assumesthat there are plenty
of particles around to carry any currents between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. In
magnetospheres that are dominated by rotation, centrifugal forces confine the ions (which pull
in the electrons electrostatically) to the region along a magnetic flux tube that is farthest from
the rotation axis. The net results are to stretch the magnetic field in the equator (see >Fig. 6-9c)
and to limit the electrical conductivity along the field line (σ m
//). Consequently, significant paral-
lel electric fields develop in the magnetosphere, probably confined to small regions quite close
to the planet, labeled impedance regions in >Fig. 6-8c (Mauk et al. 2002; Ergun et al. 2009;
Ray et al. 2009, 2010). Such parallel electric fields accelerate electrons into the atmosphere (in
regions of upward current) where they trigger strong auroral emissions. Thus, the region where
corotation with the planet begins to break down can be associated with bright aurora (see review
by Clarke et al. 2005).
Because the plasma is magnetically trapped in a rotation-dominated magnetosphere, trans-
port away from the source implies either inward or outward radial transport across the magnetic
field. In a magnetosphere that is dominated by rotation, outward transport is energetically
favored over inward transport. As plasma builds up (e.g., from ionization of material coming
from moons), it becomes energetically favorable for magnetic flux tubes laden with plasma to
interchange with outward neighbors that contain less plasma. This process of flux tube inter-
change is thought to be responsible for transport of plasma on times scales of weeks through the
giant magnetospheres, but the exact process and the mechanisms that control the radial trans-
port rate are far from understood in detail (see review in Thomas et al. 2004). Furthermore, one
expects plasma that expands into a larger volume to become colder as it moves outward. Yet the
plasmas at both Jupiterand Saturn are hotterat largerradial distance. The issue ofwhat is heating
the plasmas of these magnetospheres remains a major conundrum of planetary magnetospheres
(see review by Bagenal and Delamere 2011).
2.4.3 Global Solar-Wind-Driven Convection
Next, let us consider how the momentum of the solar wind is harnessed by processes occurring
near the magnetopause. In the early 1960s, there was a debate about how these processes oper-
ate. Axford and Hines (1961) proposed a viscous interaction at the magnetopause boundary.

274 6
Planetary Magnetospheres
This idea was dismissed for the Earth because (a) people could not see how collisionless plas-
mas could have “viscosity” and (b) the observations supported the alternative idea. Recently,
there has been a revival of interest in small-scale processes that might act like an effective vis-
cosity, and we shall return to such ideas at the end of this section. In the meantime, Dungey
(1961) showed how, under certain conditions, the solar magnetic field interconnects with
the planetary magnetic field. > Figure 6-10 shows how reconnection of the planet’s mag-
netic field with the interplanetary field harnesses the momentum of the solar wind and drives
the circulation of plasma within the magnetosphere; this circulation is sometimes called the
Dungey cycle.
The first task is to quantify the spatial and temporal scales over which the Dungey cycle
operates at each planet. The actual process of reconnection (where adjacent magnetic field lines
of different orientations are “cut and reconnected” as in steps 1 and 6 of >Fig. 6-9) is a plasma
process that occurs on very small scales. Reconnection proceeds when the IMF brought to
the magnetopause by the solar wind has a component of the embedded magnetic field that
is antiparallel to the planetary magnetic field just inside the magnetopause (step 1). The recon-
nected flux tubes is limited to relatively small structures – flux transfer events (FTEs) – whose
recurrence and fractional scale on the magnetopause decreases as the Alfven Mach number of
the flow seems to increase, consistent with a lower rate of magnetic flux being convected into
the magnetopause (see Jia et al. (2010b) for a comparison of FTEs at different planets). Mag-
netic reconnection efficiency can be strongly reduced in high (>10) magnetosonic Mach solar
wind flows due to the dominance of plasma pressure forces over magnetic forces (Scurry and
Russell 1991; Scurry et al. 1994), though (Grocott et al. 2009) found, no evidence for a signif-
icant reduction. The factors controlling the reconnection efficiency of the IMF and planetary
fields are active areas of research (La Belle-Hamer et al. 1995; Swisdak et al. 2003; Cassak and
Shay 2011).
>Figure 6-10 shows that the reconnected field lines (e.g., 2 and 7) are “bent” indicating
strong currents and tension forces. While the microscale process that initiates the reconnec-
tion is dissipative, the net result is the release of considerable magnetic tension that accelerates
plasma from the reconnection point, generating beams of energetic particles. Reconnection is a
major source of energy in the solar corona as well as a source of energetic particles in the Earth’s
magnetosphere.
Consider the situation where some fraction of the time there is a component of the IMF that
is opposite to the direction of the planetary magnetic field at the magnetopause (e.g., a nega-
tive Bz for Earth and a positive Bz for Jupiter and Saturn, ignoring the complexities of Uranus
and Neptune for the moment). Such a configuration allows the reconnection of planetary and
interplanetary fields at the dayside magnetopause (see step 1 of >Fig. 6-10). There is now one
end of the flux tube attached to the planet and the other is out in the solar wind. To estimate
how long it takes the section of flux tube in the solar wind to move to the plane of the planet’s
terminator (step 3), the subsolar magnetopause distance RMP is divided by the local solar wind
speed Vsw. For > Table 6-5, an empirical fit to Voyager data is used that includes a modest
increase in the solar wind speed with distance from the Sun, but the basic results would not be
very different if a constant value for the solar wind (say ∼400 km/s) were used. One immediately
sees the effect of the vast scale of the giant magnetospheres of the outer planets: the nose-
terminator time scale, τN−T, is a mere 10 s at Mercury, 3 min at Earth, and as much as 4 h at
Jupiter.
The next step is to calculate how long the open flux tube would take to convect to the equator
or central plane of the magnetotail (from steps 3 to 6 in >Fig. 6-10). For simplicity, the radius of

each magnetotail has been approximated as twice the subsolar standoff distance (i.e., 2RMP). We
need to divide this distance by a convective speed to estimate a minimum convective time scale.
The traditional approach to calculating the speed of circulation in the magnetosphere driven by

276 6
Planetary Magnetospheres
solar wind was to calculate the electric field associated with an object moving with the planet
relative to the solar wind, Esw = −Vsw × BIMF, assume that some fraction (say, 10–20%) of this
electric field permeates the whole magnetosphere (i.e., the convective electric field Econ ●0.1–
0.2 Esw), and then estimate how magnetospheric plasma would drift in this convection electric
field and the local planetary magnetic field (Vcon =Econ × Bplanet) (e.g., Cravens 1997).
In the meantime, to obtain a rough upper estimate for a reconnection-driven convection
speed, we have taken 10% of the solar wind speed (roughly 40 km/s at all planets), correspond-
ing to a ∼10% reconnection efficiency. Again, the large scales of the giant planet magnetospheres
mean that even with generous values for the convection speed, one obtains long time scales for
flux tubes to convect to the equator from the upper and lower magnetopause boundaries. At
Jupiter, this time scale is 80 h, equivalent to eight full rotation periods. The time scales for steps
3–6 of the Dungey cycle for the other giant planets are much less, but they are still several hours
and comparable with the planetary rotation rate. By contrast, this convection time scale is just
an hour at Earth and a few minutes at Mercury.
The Dungey cycle time scale mentioned above can also be used to estimate the length of
the magnetotail, by multiplying the reconnection time scale and the solar wind speed. More
accurately, it gives us the distance down the tail to the X-line, where further reconnection closes
the open magnetic flux (hence conserving, on average, the total magnetic flux emanating from
the planet). The re-closed magnetic flux tube then convects sunward (steps 7–10 in >Fig. 6-10)
to begin the Dungey cycle again at the dayside magnetopause. >Table 6-5 shows that values
for this X-line (often called, for obscure reasons, the distant Earth neutral line). This X-line
distance is about 20 RMP if one takes the simplest formular for reconnection-driven convective
speed Vcon to be 10% of Vsw and the tail radius to be 2RMP. Lower estimatesof Vcon (e.g., derived
including field compression by Kivelson 2007) give larger distances to the tail X-line. In practice,
we know that the Earth’s tail extends for several thousand RE, while Jupiter’s magnetotail was
encountered by Voyager 2 as it approached Saturn at a distance greater than 9,000RJ or 4 AU
downstream of Jupiter. The estimates of distances to magnetotail X-lines derived from simple
Dungey cycle principles shown in >Table 6-4 illustrate the vast scales of the magnetospheres
of the outer planets, and the huge distances that flux tubes reconnecting (re-closing) in the
tail would need to travel back to the planet if these magnetospheres were driven by Earth-like
processes.
We compared the corotation speed Vcor = Ω × R with our upper estimate of the convection
flows driven by reconnection, Vcon. The very low values in >Table 6-5 of Vcor/Vcon for Mercury
and Earth confirm that the dynamics of these magnetospheresare dominatedby coupling to the
solar wind, while it is clearly the case that rotation dominates Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and
Neptune, once again, are not simple cases with speed ratios of order unity that would suggest
the comparable importance of rotation and solar-wind-driven circulation.
In a general sense, close to the planet where the magnetic field is strong and rotation speeds
are low, one expects strong coupling to the planet’s rotation. At larger distances from the planet,
one expects decreasing corotation and an increasing influence of the solar wind. Finally, we
can estimate the size Rpp of a region (called the plasmapause at Earth) within which rotation
flows dominate and outside of which the solar wind interaction drives flows. The values for Rpp
in the bottom row of >Table 6-5 further illustrate how the planets’ magnetospheres span the
range between the extremes of Jupiter (where Rpp ≫and rotation dominates throughout)
and Mercury (where RPP ≪means that there is no region of corotating plasma in the tiny
magnetosphere).

Fundamentally, dawn-dusk asymmetry of the magnetic field and plasma flows inside a
planetary magnetosphere is the result of the solar wind interaction with the magnetosphere.
To account for these solar-wind-driven dawn-dusk asymmetries, either a mechanism such as
reconnection-driven global convection (as in the Dungey cycle above) is evoked or one might
consider a mechanism more akin to the original (Axford and Hines 1961) model of a viscous
interaction of the solar wind with the magnetopause boundary. Rather than a Dungey-style
global cycle of reconnection (that opens planetary magnetic flux on the dayside, carries the
flux tube over the poles, and closes the flux in the tail), the magnetic flux could be opened and
closed intermittently in small-scale structures in turbulent interaction regions on the flanks of
the magnetosphere.
So what might be responsible for viscous processes at the magnetosphere? Except in the
densest locations (e.g., ionospheres), space plasmas are generally collisionless (i.e., the mean
free path is larger than the typical scale of the system). Thus, it is necessary to find other dissi-
pative processes occurring on a scale comparable to the magnetopausethickness. But there are a
variety of waves, perhaps driven by shear (Kelvin–Helmoltz) instabilities or by nonequilibrium
particle velocity distributions, that might act as a means for the solar wind plasma to interaction
with the plasma at the boundary of the magnetosphere, particularly when the magnetic field on
either side of the boundary is weak. With strong contrast in flows across the magnetopause,
the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) – analogous to “wind over water” instability of hydro-
dynamics – is a good possibility. Observations at Earth and numerical models show that KHI
vortices generate twisted magnetic fields, strong currents, and small-scale reconnections (both
opening and closing flux intermittently) that allow plasma transport across the boundary (see
review by Delamere and Bagenal 2010). Such a viscous process could be considered a comet-
like interaction, with the IMF being temporarily “hung up” on the magnetopause, is to stretch
the IMF out behind the object in an extended tail. This would mean that the magnetic field in
the magnetotail would not be attached to the planet (as implied by >Fig. 6-10 for the Dungey
cycle) but has each end in the solar wind and is “kinked” where flux tubes are dragged over the
magnetopause.
2.4.4 Plasmoid Ejection
The Dungey cycle of opening magnetic flux on the dayside of a magnetosphere and subsequent
closing in the magnetic tail produces a pinching off of the nightside plasma sheet and ejection
of magnetospheric plasma down the magnetotail (see far right of >Fig. 6-10). The ejection of
such a blob of plasma – a plasmoid – involves rapid conversion of energy stored in the stretched
magnetic field into kinetic energy of the ejected plasmoid as well as beams of energetic particles.
Such an explosive ejection of material and the associated phenomena is called a “substorm” at
Earth. Substorms occur frequently (on average several times per day) at Earth from an X-line
that ranges from 8 to 20 RE.
For a magnetosphere that is driven primarily by rotation rather than the solar wind (i.e.,
Rpp in listed in >Table 6-5 is large), as the plasma rotates around onto the nightside, it is no
longer confined by magnetopause currents, moves farther from the planet, and stretches the
magnetic field with it (field line (1) in >Fig. 6-11). At some point, either the coupling to the
planet breaks down completely (e.g., because the Alfven travel time between the equator and
the poles becomes a substantial fraction of a rotational period) or the field becomes so radially

totail (field lines (2), (3), and (4) in >Fig. 6-11 from Vasyliunas 1983). Kivelson and Southwood
(2005) point out that the stretched, equatorial magnetic field becomes so weak that the gyro-
radii of the heavy ions becomes comparable to scales of local gradients. It is possible that the
plasma diffuses across the magnetic field and “drizzles” down the magnetotail. If the process
were entirely diffusive, then the magnetic flux would remain connected to the planet. The flux
tubes would become unloaded and presumably shrink (“dipolarize”) as they swung around to
the dayside.
It is quite possible that Dungey cycle transport of flux toward the center of the magneto-
tail acts in combination with rotationally driven expulsion of plasmoids (sometimes called the
Vasyliunas cycle), depending on how much flux is opened by large-scale dayside reconnection
and whether the opened flux tubes penetrate deep into the tail vs. being closed by reconnection
on the flanks of the magnetosphere.

Magnetospheres of the Outer Planets
The Voyager flybys of all four giant planets allowed comparison of their magnetospheres (e.g.,
Bagenal 1992). While all four are dominated by rotation, they can be separated into large, reg-
ular, and fast rotators (Jupiter and Saturn) vs. irregular oblique rotators (Uranus and Neptune).
We discuss each planetary magnetosphere in turn below.

Planetary Magnetospheres 6

3.1 Jupiter
Jupiter is a planet of superlatives: the most massive planet in the solar system, which rotates the
fastest, has the strongest magnetic field and has the most massive satellite system of any planet.
These unique properties lead to volcanoes on Io and a population of energetic plasma trapped
in the magnetic field that provides a physical link between the satellites, particularly Io, and the
planet Jupiter. For those seeking further details, the jovian magnetosphere is reviewed in seven
chapters of the book Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere (Bagenal et al. 2004), and
only subsequent research is cited in this section.
Clear indications that Jupiter traps electrons in its magnetic field were apparent as soon as
astronomers turned radio receivers to the sky. Early radio measurements showed that Jupiter
has a strong magnetic field tilted about 10○from the spin axis, that energetic (MeV) electrons
were trapped at the equator close to the planet, and that Io must be interacting with the sur-
rounding plasma and triggering bursts of emission. The magnetometers and particle detectors
on Pioneer10 (1973)and Pioneer11 (1974)revealed the vastness ofJupiter’s magnetosphere and
made in situ measurements of energetic ions and electrons. The Voyager 1 flyby in 1979 revealed
Io’s prodigious volcanic activity, thus explaining why this innermost Galilean moon plays such
a strong role. Additional data came from subsequent traversals by the Ulysses (1992), Cassini
(2000), and New Horizons (2007) spacecraft, but it was the 34 orbits of Galileo (1995–2003)
around Jupiter that mapped out magnetospheric structures and monitored their temporal vari-
ability. As at Earth, magnetospheric activity is projected onto the planet’s atmosphere via auroral
emissions; this has been observed from X-rays to radio wavelengths with ground- and space-
based telescopes. Jupiter has the advantage for us over the rest of the outer planets of not just
being very large but also being much closer, allowing high-quality measurements to be made
from Earth.
The magnetosphere of Jupiter extends well beyond the orbits of the Galilean satellite sys-
tem (> Fig. 6-4), and it is these moons that provide much of the plasma (> Table 6-3) and
some interesting magnetospheric phenomena. In particular, Io loses about 1 ton/s of atmo-
spheric material (mostly SOand dissociation products), which, when ionized to sulfur and
oxygen ions, becomes trapped in Jupiter’s magnetic field (> Fig. 6-12). Coupling to Jupiter
causes the magnetospheric plasma to corotate with the planet. Strong centrifugal forces con-
fine the plasma toward the equator. Thus, the densest plasma forms a torus around Jupiter at
the orbit of Io.
Compared with the local plasma, which is corotating with Jupiter at 74 km/s, the neutral
atoms are moving slowly, close to Io’s orbital speed of 17 km/s. When a neutral atom becomes
ionized (via electron impact), it experiences an electric field, resulting in a gyromotion of
57 km/s. Thus, new S+ and O+ ions gain 540 and 270 eV in gyro-energy. The new “pickup”
ion is also accelerated up to the speed of the surrounding plasma. The necessary momentum
comes from the torus plasma, which is in turn coupled, via field-aligned currents, to Jupiter –
the jovian flywheel being the ultimate source of momentum and energy for most processes in
the magnetosphere. About one-third to one-half of the neutral atoms are ionized to produce
additional fresh plasma, while the rest are lost via reactions in which a neutral atom exchanges
an electron with a torus ion. On becoming neutralized, the particle is no longer confined by
the magnetic field and flies off as an energetic neutral atom. This charge-exchange process adds
gyro-energy to the ions and extracts momentum from the surrounding plasma, but it does not
add more plasma to the system.

The main components of the Jupiter-Io system
The Io plasma torus has a total mass of ∼2 megaton, which would be replenished by a
source of ∼1 ton/s in ∼23 days. Multiplying by a typical energy (Ti ∼60 eV, Te ∼5 eV), we obtain
∼× J for the total thermal energy of the torus. The observed UV power is about 1.5 TW,
emitted via more than 50 ion spectral lines, most of which are in the EUV. This emission would
drain all the energy of the torus electrons in ∼7 h. Ion pickup replenishes energy, and Coulomb
collisions feed the energy from ions to electrons but not at a sufficient rate to maintain the
observed emissions. A source of additional energy, perhaps mediated via plasma waves, seems
to be supplying hot electrons and a comparable amount of energy as ion pickup. The 20–80 day
time scale (equivalent to 50–200 rotations) for the replacement of the torus indicates surpris-
ingly slow radial transport that maintains a relatively strong radial density gradient. Flux tubes
laden with denser, cooler, plasma move outward and relatively empty flux tubes containing
hotter plasma from the outer magnetosphere move inward.
Voyager, Galileo, and, particularly, Cassini observations of UV emissions from the torus
show temporal variability (by about a factor 2) in torus properties (Steffl et al. 2004, 2006).
Models of the physical chemistry of the torus match the observed properties in regard to the
production of neutral O and S atoms, a radial transport time, and a source of hot electrons
(Delamere and Bagenal 2003). Steffl et al. (2008) showed that a small (<1%) hot electron pop-
ulation that varies with longitude and drifts by a few percent with respect to corotation could
explain modulations in ionization state and emissions. The source of these hot electrons is not
understood, but the discussions of what processes might be causing periodicities observed at
Saturn (see next section) suggest that perhaps ionospheric winds might be driving currents
through the jovian magnetosphere, carried by these hot electrons. On longer time scales, the

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
281
variation in torus emissions observed over several months by Cassini reflect the observed
changes in the output of Io’s volcanic plumes (Delamere et al. 2004; Bagenal and Delamere
2011).
The earliest theoretical studies concluded that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is “all plasma-
sphere” with little influence of solar-wind-driven convection. Indeed, rotation dominates the
plasma flows observed in the jovian magnetosphere out to distances ∼70 RJ. Yet, the presence
of sulfur and oxygen ions in the middle magnetosphere, far from Io, indicates that plasma is
transported outward, in directions transverse to the magnetic field.
The net radial transport is thought to be slowest near Io’s orbit (∼15 m/s) and to speed up
farther out (∼50 m/s beyond 10RJ). Plasmafrom the Io torus spreads out from Jupiter as a ∼5RJ-
thick plasma sheet throughout the magnetosphere. While the flow direction remains primarily
rotational, both a lag behind corotation and local time asymmetries increase steadily with dis-
tance from the planet. Bursts of flow down the magnetotail are observed and also, on the dawn
flanks, occasional strong bursts of super-rotation. Below we return to these deviations from
corotation and discuss how they relate to auroral structures.
As the equatorial plasma rotates rapidly, it exerts a radial (centrifugal) stress on the flux
tubes. Additional stress is provided by the radial pressure gradient of the plasma, inflating
the magnetic field (see >Fig. 6-13). The net result is a stretching of the initially dipolar field
lines away from the planet, in a configuration that implies an azimuthal current in the near-
equatorial disk (> Fig. 6-13a). The lower two panels of >Fig. 6-13 show magnetic field lines
derived from models that include the internally generated field plus the effects of currents
on the magnetopause and in the plasma sheet. >Figure 6-8d shows magnetic field lines pro-
jected onto the equatorial plane and illustrates how the field lines also bend or “curl” in the
azimuthal direction, which means that there are also radial currents in the equatorial plasma
sheet (> Fig. 6-13b). Alternatively one can think of sub-corotating plasma pulling the mag-
netic field away from radial. At Jupiter, the field is more or less azimuthally symmetric out to
about 50RJ, but >Fig. 6-13d shows that strong local time asymmetries develop in the outer
magnetosphere (Khurana 2001; Khurana and Schwarzl 2005).
Just as at Earth, the auroral emissions at Jupiter are important indicators of magnetospheric
processes. With limited spacecraft coverage of these magnetospheres, auroral activity is a pro-
jection of magnetospheric processes, communicated via precipitating energetic particles, onto
the atmosphere; thus, it allows us to study global processes not yet accessed by spacecraft.
>Figure 6-14 illustrates the three main types of aurora at Jupiter (see the reviews by Bhardwaj
and Gladstone 2000; Clarke et al. 2005). There is a fairly steady main auroral oval that pro-
duces approximately 10W globally and that can exceed 1 Wm−locally. This oval is quite
narrow, corresponding to about 1○in latitude or a few hundred kilometers horizontally in
the atmosphere of Jupiter and mapping along magnetic field lines to (20–30)RJ at the equa-
tor in the magnetosphere, well inside the magnetopause. Auroral emissions are also observed
at the feet of flux tubes at Io, Europa, and Ganymede. While the magnetosphereinteraction with
Callisto is thought to be much weaker than for the other satellites, any Callisto aurora would
be difficult to separate from the main aurora. The Io-related aurora includes a “wake” signa-
ture that extends halfway around Jupiter. The third type of jovian aurora is the highly variable
polar aurora, which occurs at higher latitudes than the main aurora, corresponding to greater
magnetospheric distances.
The fact that the shape of the jovian main auroral oval is constant and fixed, in magnetic
coordinates (including an indication of a persistent magnetic anomaly in the northern hemi-
sphere), tells us that the auroral emissions correspond to a persistent magnetospheric process

conﬁguration (c) in the noon-midnight meridian plane and (d) in the equatorial plane derived from
in situ magnetic ﬁeld measurements (Khurana and Schwarzl 2005)
that causes a more or less constant bombardment of electrons onto Jupiter’s atmosphere. Unlike
the terrestrial auroral oval, the jovian oval has no relation to the boundary between open and
closed field lines of the polar cap; it maps to regions well within the magnetosphere. It is diffi-
cult to map the magnetic field lines accurately because of the strong equatorial currents, which
are variable and imprecisely determined. But it has become clear that the main aurora is the
signature of Jupiter’s attempt to spin up its magnetosphere or, more accurately, Jupiter’s failure
to spin up its magnetosphere fully.
>Figure 6-8a shows the simple current system proposed by Hill (1979). As the Iogenic
plasma moves outward, the conservation of angular momentum would suggest that the plasma
should lose angularspeed. In a magnetized plasma, however, electrical currents easilyflow along
magnetic fields and couple the magnetospheric plasma to Jupiter’s flywheel. Hill (1979) argued
that at some point the load on the ionosphere increases to the point where the coupling between
the ionosphere and corotating atmosphere – manifested as the ionospheric conductivity – is not
sufficient to carry the necessary current, causing the plasma to lag behind corotation. Using a

Planetary Magnetospheres 6

⊡Fig. 6-14
Three main regions of Jupiter’s aurora: Main oval, satellite footprints, polar emission (From Clarke
et al. 2005)
simple dipole magnetic field, Hill (1979) obtained an expression for the critical distance for
corotation lag that depended on the mass production and transport from Io and the (poorly
determined) ionospheric conductivity. Matching his simple model to the Voyager observations
of McNutt et al. (1979) and Hill et al. (1981) found he could model the observed profiles of
azimuthal flow with a source giving 2–5 ton/s and an onospheric conductivity equal to 0.1 mho.
Over the past decade, Jupiter’s main aurora has become an active area of study. Researchers have
considered the effects of the non-dipolar nature of the magnetic field, the narrowness of the
auroral emissions, realistic mass-loading rates, the nonlinear feedback of ionospheric conduc-
tivity responding to electron precipitation, and the development of electrostatic potential drops
in the region of low density between the ionosphere and torus (Cowley and Bunce 2001, 2003;
Nichols and Cowley 2005; Ray et al. 2010). The understanding of plasma processes developed
in the terrestrial magnetosphere is being applied to the different regimes at Jupiter and will
ultimately be tested when the Juno spacecraft goes into a close polar orbit in 2016.
The auroral emissions poleward ofthe main auroral oval (see >Fig. 6-14)are highlyvariable;
they are modulated by the solar wind and controlled in local time, being usually dark on the
dawn side and brighter on the dusk side (see the reviews by Grodent et al. 2003; Clarke et al.
2005). The region of magnetic field lines that is open to the solar wind in the polar cap is thought
to be relatively small (Vogt et al. 2011). Thus, much polar auroral activity reflects activity in the
outer magnetosphere, occurring on closed magnetic field lines. Polar auroral activity has been
associated with polar cusps (Waite et al. 2001; Pallier and Prangé 2004; Bunce et al. 2004) as well
as tail plasma sheet reconnection and the ejection of plasmoids down the magnetotail (Grodent
et al. 2004; Radioti et al. 2008, 2010, 2011; Ge et al. 2010). Spectral observations of auroral X-ray
flares suggest that energetic ions are bombarding the polar atmosphere and may be the signature
of the plasma sheet return (downward) current (Waite et al. 1994; Cravens et al. 1995; Hui et al.
2010; Ozak et al. 2010).
A major interest in studying the aurora is to explore how the various emissions are related
to the dynamics of the outer magnetosphere. The innermost region, which we will call the Hill
region, comprises the equatorial plasma disk where rotation dominates the flow. At a distance

284 6
Planetary Magnetospheres
of about 20 RJ, the lag of plasma in the equatorial plasma sheet behind strict corotation drives
upward currents, and the associated electron bombardment of the atmosphere causes the main
aurora.
The middle magnetosphere is a compressible region (sometimes called the “cushion” or
Vasyliunas region, afterhis seminal article (Vasyliunas 1983) in which the dynamics of the outer
magnetosphere was first addressed in a substantial fashion). On the dayside of the magneto-
sphere, the ram pressure of the solar wind compresses the magnetosphere. Inward motion on
the dawn side reduces the load on the ionosphere, producing a correspondingly dark region in
the dawn polar aurora (>Fig. 6-14). On the dusk side, the plasma expands outward and strong
currents try to keep the magnetospheric plasma corotating. These strong currents produce the
active dusk polar aurora. Kivelson and Southwood (2005) argued that the rapid expansion of
flux tubes in the afternoon to dusk sector means that the second adiabatic invariant is not
conserved, which results in the heating and thickening of the plasma sheet.
Pursuing evidence for Vasyliunas’ argument that plasmoids are ejected down the jovian
magnetotail, Grodent et al. (2004) found evidence of spots of auroral emission poleward of
the main aurora connected to the nightside magnetosphere that flashed with an approximately
10-min duration. Such events were rare, recurring only about once per 1–2 days. These flashes
seemed to occur in the pre-midnight sector, and Grodent et al. (2004) estimated that they are
coupled to a region of the magnetotail that was about 5RJ–50RJ across and located further than
100RJ down the tail. Studies of in situ measurements (Russell et al. 2000; Woch et al. 2002;
Vogt et al. 2010; Ge et al. 2010) led to the conclusion that plasmoids on the order of ∼25RJ in
scale were being ejected every 4 h–3 days, with a predominance for the post-midnight sector
and distances of 70–120RJ. Could such plasmoids account for most of the plasma loss down the
magnetotail? Bagenal (2007)approximated a plasmoid as a disk ofplasma sheet 2RJ thick having
diameter 25RJ and density of 0.01 cm−, so that each plasmoid has a mass of about 500 ton.
Ejecting one such plasmoid per day is equivalent to losing 0.006 ton/s. Increasing the frequency
to once per hour raises the loss rate to 0.15 ton/s. Thus, on the one hand, even with optimistic
numbers, the loss of plasma from the magnetosphere due to such plasmoid ejections cannot
match the canonical plasma production rate, 0.5 ton/s. On the other hand, a steady flow of
plasma of density 0.01 cm−, in a conduit that is 5RJ thick and 100RJ wide, moving at a speed
of 200 km/s would provide a loss of 0.5 ton/s. Such numbers suggest that a quasi-steady loss
rate is feasible. The question of the mechanism remains unanswered. Bagenal (2007) proposed
three options: a diffusive “drizzle” across weak, highly stretched, magnetotail fields; a quasi-
steady reconnection of small plasmoids, below the scale detectable via auroral emissions; or a
continuous but perhaps gusty magnetospheric wind.
In the spring of 2007, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past Jupiter, getting a gravitational
boost on its way to Pluto, and made an unprecedented passage down the core of the jovian mag-
netotail, exiting on the northern dusk flank. For over 3 months, while covering a distance of
2,000RJ, the spacecraft measured a combination of iogenic ions and ionospheric plasma (indi-
cated by H+ and H+ ions) flowing down the tail (McComas et al. 2007; McNutt et al. 2007). The
fluxes of both thermal and energetic particles were highly variable on time scales of minutes to
days. The tailward fluxes of internally generated plasma led (McComas and Bagenal 2007) to
argue that perhaps Jupiter does not have a complete Dungey cycle but that the large time scale
for any reconnection flow (see > Table 6-4) suggests that magnetic flux that is opened near
the subsolar magnetopause re-closes on the magnetopause before it has traveled down the tail.
They suggested that the magnetotail comprises a pipe of internally generated plasma that dis-
connects from the planetary field and flows away from Jupiter in intermittent surges or bubbles,

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
285
with no planetward Dungey return flow. Delamere and Bagenal (2010) argue that, due to the
viscous processes on the magnetopause boundary, along the flanks of the magnetotail, solar
wind plasma becomes entrained and mixed with the ejected iogenic material.
An overview sketch of the dynamics of the magnetosphere as proposed by Delamere and
Bagenal (2010) is presented in >Fig. 6-15. Alternative views combine the Vasyliunas rotation-
ally driven ejection of plasmoids of >Fig. 6-11 with the Dungey cycle of >Fig. 6-9 (e.g., Cowley
et al. 2007, 2008b; Kivelson and Southwood 2005). Hopefully, observations by the Juno mission
will distinguish between these different ideas.
3.2 Saturn
Before the Cassini mission, it was tempting to dismiss the magnetosphere of Saturn as merely
a smaller, less exciting, version of the jovian magnetosphere. However, Cassini measurements
of the particles and fields in Saturn’s neighborhood have shown processes similar to those at
Jupiter (e.g., satellite sources, ion pickup, flux tube interchange, corotation, etc.), but they have
also revealed substantial intriguing differences (for reviews of initial results of the Cassini mis-
sion see Dougherty et al. 2009). The magnetosphere of Saturn is strongly dominated by neutral
atoms and molecules. The number-densityratio of neutrals to ions is 12:1 in the Enceladustorus
compared with 1:20 in the Iotorus. In contrast with Jupiter’s steadymain aurora, Saturn’s auroral
emissions are strongly modulated by the solar wind, particularly the solar wind ram pressure.
While one might expect the alignment of Saturn’s magnetic axis with the planet’s spin axis to
produce an azimuthally symmetric magnetosphere, observations show an intriguing rotational
modulation. Even more mysteriously, the rotational modulation varies with time (on time scale
of ∼years) and is different for the northern and southern hemispheres. The magnetosphere of
Saturn is shown in >Fig. 6-16. Below, we provide a brief summary of current ideas about these
topics, which are under active research as the Cassini spacecraft continues to orbit Saturn.
One of the great discoveries of the Cassini mission to Saturn has been the active volcanism
of the small icy moon Enceladus. While Enceladus is a mere one-seventh the size of Io, this small
moon suffers tidal heating that drives the eruption of geysers from the south polar region. The
geyser plumes, extending over 500 km from the surface, seem to be mostly ice particles with
water vapor and minor quantities of molecular nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide (Porco
et al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2006; Waite et al. 2006).
Estimates of the total neutral production rate of water molecules (presumably ultimately
coming from Enceladus’ plumes) vary around the initial value of 300 kg/s, determined from
the initial UV occultation of the plume by Hansen et al. (2006) which is the same as from the
earlier (Jurac and Richardson 2005) model constructed to match HST observations of the OH
neutral cloud. Sittler et al. (2008) preferred 600 kg/s but only claimed a factor of 2 accuracy,
so this value is still consistent with Hansen et al. (2006)’s 300 kg/s. Saur et al. (2008) modeled
the electrodynamics of the plume deriving values as high as 1,600 kg/s for the E0 flyby and as
low as 200 kg/s for E1 and E2. Meanwhile, a value of ∼200 kg/s was derived from a second UV
occultation reported by Hansen et al. (2008). Similarly, Fleshman et al. (2010a, b) found 100–
180 kg/s was consistent with their physical chemical modeling of the Enceladus torus. Finally,
Smith et al. (2010) have analyzed INMS data from three Cassini flybys of Enceladus from which
they conclude that the net production has increased from <72kg/s (at the time of E2) to 190 kg/s
(at E3) to 750 kg/s (at E5). Thus, the Enceladus neutral source rate could have varied by a factor
of 10 between July 2005 and October 2008.

Composite sketch of the structure and dynamics of the jovian magnetosphere. Inside ∼60 RJ
the plasma ﬂow is corotational and the plasma sheet has little local time asymmetry. Beyond
∼60 RJ, radial outﬂow combines with rotation to produce spiral ﬂow that removes the plasma
from the magnetosphere within about a day. Beyond ∼80–100 RJ, blobs of plasma detach (at an
x point) and are shed down the magnetotail. Between midnight and dawn the region of x-points
is well deﬁned by in situ observations and is consistent with estimates of the location where tail-
ward Maxwell stresses dominate over conﬁnement by the planetary magnetic ﬁeld. In the dusk
to premidnight region the location of x points is not well determined, but observational evidence
suggests that it could be as far as 150–200 RJ downtail. Strong velocity shear across the magne-
topause drives instabilities that act as a viscous-like interaction between the draped solar wind
and largely closed magnetosphere, intermittently transferring mass and momentum across the
magnetopause boundary. This interaction region is particularly wide on the dawnside of the mag-
netosphere, corresponding to what is sometimes called the “cushion region”. After Delamere &

The fate of the neutrals is more complicated at Saturn than Jupiter. The high neutral-to-ion
density ratio at Saturn is a result of lower ionization rates (caused as much by photoionization
at Saturn as electron-impact ionization that dominates at Jupiter). Only a fraction of the neutral
material is transported out into the plasma sheet. Some of the corotating ions charge exchange
with neutrals to become escaping fast neutrals but other collisional processes such as photo-
and electron-dissociation, neutral–neutral collisions, and low-velocity charge exchange “puff”
up the neutral cloud, spreading it beyond Enceladus’ orbit (4RS) as well as sending a substantial
flux of neutrals into the planet Saturn.
It is not clear that the rate of ionization vs. other neutral loss processes would be main-
tained at the modeled fractions if the neutral source increases to Smith et al. (2010)’s E5 values
of ∼750 kg/s or Saur et al. (2008)’s E0 value of 1,600 kg/s. Neutral production increases the
amount of neutral–neutral collisions that would cause more of the material to spread out from
Enceladus’ orbit. One might expect that more material would escape as neutrals rather than
be ionized. Electron-impact ionization would be reduced due to collisional cooling of the elec-
trons. In fact, Tokar et al. (2009) do not report higher-than-average plasma densities around

the time of E5. Estimates of the plasma source range between 12 and 250 kg/s (see review by
Bagenal and Delamere 2011).
The nearly three orders of magnitude difference in the ion–neutral density ratios of the
two magnetospheres can be been explained in terms of a much lower energy input into the
Saturn system (Delamere et al. 2007). At Saturn, the plasma flowing past Enceladus (at an orbital
distance of ∼4 saturnian radii) has a slower speed than the plasma flow past Io (at ∼6 jovian
radii). A factor 2 difference in relative motion (i.e., 26 km/s at Enceladus as against 57 km/s at
Io) means that new ions pick up a factor 4 less energy. With less pickup energy, the ions deliver
less energy to the electrons. At low electron temperatures, the ionization rates plummet and,
correspondingly, plasma production drops. In fact, Delamere et al. (2007) showed (backed up
by an extensive study by Fleshman et al. 2010a, b) that without an additional source of hot
electrons (similar to that in the Io plasma torus), the Enceladus plasma torus would not be
sustained.
The weaker plasma source at Saturn results in weaker centrifugal stresses and weaker mag-
netospheric currents. Thus, the field structure at Saturn is similar to that shown in >Fig. 6-13
for Jupiter but with less pronounced distortion from dipolar. The plasma pressure is also much
reduced, so that Saturn’s magnetosphere is less compressible than Jupiter’s and shows a less
dramatic response to changes in solar wind dynamic pressure (Kanani et al. 2010).
>Figure 6-16 shows Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Saturn’s aurora (Clarke et al.
2005). In contrast with Jupiter’s large main auroral oval, which maps to regions deep inside
the magnetosphere, Saturn’s small auroral oval and strong variations in auroral intensity with
solar wind conditions indicates that Saturn’s aurora, like Earth’s, marks the boundary of open
and closed regions of magnetic flux. The picture was clarified during a campaign of combined
Hubble and Cassini observations as the spacecraft approached Saturn in late 2000. For 22 days,
Cassini’s instruments measured the magnetic field, plasma density, and plasma velocity in the
solar wind, while Hubble cameras and the Cassini radio antennas monitored Saturn’s auroral
activity. Nature cooperated and provided a couple of interplanetary shock waves that passed
the Cassini spacecraft on January 15 and 25, 2001, and then hit the magnetosphere of Saturn
some 17 h later. Clarke et al. (2005) reported HST observations of the subsequent brightening
of auroral emission, and Kurth et al. (2005) reported accompanying increases in radio emission.
Crary et al. (2005) show a correlation of auroral intensity with solar wind dynamical pressure,
supporting the view that the solar wind has an Earth like role at Saturn.
But further study showed that it was compression of the magnetopause by the solar wind
that correlates with auroral intensity rather than reconnection of the solar and planetary mag-
netic fields. Crary et al. (2005) pointed out that, at Saturn’s orbit, the solar magnetic field is
essentially tangential so that the solar and planetary fields are largely orthogonal to each other:
far from optimal conditions for magnetic reconnection. Clarke et al. (2005, 2009) showed
that the brightest auroral emissions occurred after the passage of a solar wind pressure pulse.
Cowley et al. (2005) suggested that the rapid compression of Saturn’s magnetosphere induces
enhanced tail reconnection, which would explain the subsequent shrinking of the auroral oval
(see >Fig. 6-9). The explanation for why Saturn’s aurora responds to compression rather than
the direction of the IMF (as at Earth) principally involves the longer time scale for the solar
wind to flow past the larger magnetosphere. Fluctuations of Bz component of the IMF are simi-
lar at Earth and Saturn (∼10s min to an hour or two). Similarly, the rate of dayside reconnection
is thought to be about the same at each planet. But the amount of open flux in Saturn’s tail is
thought to be much larger than Earth’s (about a factor of ∼100) so the buildup of open flux
in the magnetotail (stages 1–4 in >Fig. 6-9) could be much longer, typically ∼1 week instead
of ∼1 h. So, Saturn’s tail will almost never respond to individual intervals of positive Bz, but

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
289
instead inflates on time scales comparable to the time between recurrent solar wind pressure
pulses. Thus, compression-induced tail reconnection, while rather rare at Earth, may be the
usual mode at Saturn (Jackman et al. 2005; Badman et al. 2005).
The magnetospheric processes driving Saturn’s aurora began to be better understood after
Cassini moved to higher magnetic latitudes in 2007. Observations by Cassini particle and
field instruments show a large-scale field-aligned current present at the open–closed field line
boundary (Cowley et al. 2008a; Bunce et al. 2008, 2010; Talboys et al. 2009a, b), in the same
region as auroral radio emissions were generated (Lamy et al. 2009, 2010).
In the mean time, the difficulties in measuring Saturn’s rotation rate have wreaked havoc
with our simple ideas of magnetospheric dynamics. So how could one establish how fast the
interior of a gas planet is spinning? The usual trick is to measure the periodicity of radio emis-
sions modulated by the planet’s internal magnetic field. In this method, it is assumed that the
magnetic field is tilted and that the dynamo region where the field is generated spins at a rate
representative of the bulk of the planet. Recent Cassini data indicate that apparent changes in
Saturn’s spin could in fact be caused by processes external to the planet. This raises new ques-
tions about how we measure and understand the rotation of the large gas planets. Saturn at
first dumbfounded planetary theorists who study dynamo models by being observed to have
a highly symmetric internal magnetic field. A field that is symmetric about the rotation axis
violates a basic theorem of magnetic dynamos (Cowling 1933). The second puzzle came with
the detection of a systematic rotational modulation of the radio emission similar to a flashing
strobe, which should not occur for a symmetric magnetic field. Meanwhile, radio measure-
ments have revealed that Saturn’s day appears to have become about 6–8 min longer – it is now
roughly 10 h and 47 min – since the 1980s when measured by the Voyager missions (Kurth
et al. 2008). Furthermore, the spin rate seems to keep changing and may be modulated by the
solar wind speed (Zarka et al. 2007) and is different in the northern and southern hemispheres
(Gurnett et al. 2009), the rotation rates switching hemispheres over equinox (Gurnett et al. 2010;
Southwood 2011). Auroral UV emissions are also modulated at the same rate at the radio emis-
sions (Nichols et al. 2010), as are oscillations in the magnetic fields (Andrews et al. 2010a, b).
The variation in modulation with season evokes an atmospheric driver. To drive periodic mod-
ulations with thermospheric winds via currents in the ionosphere will require realistic models
of Saturn’s ionosphere (Smith 2011; Galand et al. 2011).
A fundamental issue is whether the magnetospheric observations, including the radio
emissions, do actually require the magnetic field emanating from the interior of Saturn to be
asymmetric. Nearly 30 years ago, Stevenson suggested that strong shear motions in an electri-
cally conducting shell surrounding the dynamo might impose symmetry around the rotational
axis (Stevenson 1982). That the rotational modulation of magnetospheric phenomena seems to
be fairly constant with radial distance, that dynamic changes occur in the external plasma struc-
tures around Saturn, and that there is an apparent modulation by the solar wind speed indicate
that an external explanation for Saturn’s apparently erratic spin rate seems far more plausi-
ble than perturbations in the massive interior of the planet. Yet, localized magnetic anomalies
(i.e., high-order multipoles) at high latitudes remain possible and may be affecting the cur-
rents that couple the magnetosphere to the planet (Southwood and Kivelson 2007). Gurnett
et al. (2007) showed how Saturn’s radio emission, the magnetic field measured in the magne-
tosphere, and the density of the plasma trapped in the magnetic field are all modulated with
the same drifting period. They argued that the process that transports plasma radially outward
could be stronger on one side of Saturn than the other, as illustrated in the top left of >Fig. 6-16.
Gurnett et al. (2007) suggested that this circulation pattern also produces higher plasma den-
sities in the region of stronger outflow and proposed that plasma production stresses the

electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and the planet, causing the pattern of
weaker or stronger outward flow to slowly slip in phase relative to Saturn’s internal rotation.
What causes the proposed asymmetric convection pattern? In the 1980s, researchers tried to
explain variations in the Io plasma torus (Hill et al. 1981) by invoking a convection pattern that
rotated with the planet; however, evidence of such a flow pattern in the jovian magnetosphere
remains elusive. Alternatively, a system of neutral winds in Saturn’s atmosphere could drag the
ionosphere around, which would stir up the magnetosphere electrodynamically and provide a
source of hot electrons. Could small variations in the high-energy electron population in the
Enceladus torus, similar to those in the Io torus, be causing the dramatic changes in plasma
density observed by Cassini? If so, large-scale convection patterns in the magnetosphere may
not be necessary, just minor modulations in the electrical currents that flow along the magnetic
field between the equatorial plasma disk and the planet’s ionosphere, bringing small fluxes of
ionizing high-energy electrons to the torus. Delamere and Bagenal (2008) showed that a mod-
ulation in the small hot-electron population could produce the factor of 2 variation in plasma
density observed by Cassini.
Undoubtedly, the issue of Saturn’s rotation rate and its coupling to the magnetosphere will
be a vital area of exploration over the next few years. Similarly, it will be important to investigate
whether material is ejected down the tail in the manner and to the extent of the jovian system.
Only a few plasmoids have been detected to date at Saturn, but this may be a result of limited
coverage by the Cassini spacecraft (e.g., Jackman et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2008). The substantial
polar cap, marked by the aurora, and the influence of the solar wind on the auroral intensity
indicate that the Dungey reconnection cycle plays a substantial role at Saturn. The extent and
mechanism whereby any return, planetward, flow operates in the magnetotail awaits further
exploration.
3.3 Uranus and Neptune
The Voyager flybys of Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989) revealed what have to be described as
highly irregular magnetospheres. The non-dipolar magnetic fields and the large angle between
the magnetic and rotation axes not only pose interesting problems for dynamo theorists but
also challenge the ideas of magnetospheric dynamics. Unfortunately, little study has been made
of these odd magnetospheres for the past 15 years, and there is only slim hope of further explo-
ration for quite some time. Thus, there is not much to add to the comparative reviews of their
fields by Connerney (1993) and of their magnetospheres by Bagenal (1992). Here, we provide
a brief précis of these reviews to which the reader should turn for original references.
> Tables 6-1 and > Table 6-2 as well as > Fig. 6-4 show Uranus and Neptune to have
substantial magnetospheres that envelope most of their satellites. >Figures 6-2 and >Fig. 6-3
give a sense of the irregularity of their magnetic fields, approximated as large tilts and off-
sets. > Table 6-2 tells us that from just the solar wind and planetary parameters, we should
expect both rotation and solar wind coupling to affect the dynamics of these magnetospheres
(though the weak IMF of the outer heliosphere suggests that reconnection will be much weaker
than at planets closer to the Sun). >Figures 6-17 and >6-18 illustrate how the orientations of
these planets’ magnetic fields (> Fig. 6-2), which rotate about the planet’s spin axis every 16–
17 h, might affect the solar wind coupling process. For Uranus around solstice (the Voyager era
of the mid-1980s), when the spin axis is pointed roughly toward the Sun, the large tilt of the
magnetic axis will result in a magnetosphere that to first approximation resembles that of the

bottom panel shows a numerical simulation of the helical magnetotail (Toth et al. (2004))
Earth but revolves every 17 h. The finite propagation (at the Alfven speed) of this rotational
modulation down the magnetotail produces a helical plasma sheet and braided lobes of oppo-
sitely directed magnetic field (> Fig. 6-17). At Neptune, the planet’s obliquity being similar to
Earth and Saturn, one might have expected the fairly simple configurations of either of those
planet’s magnetospheres. But the large tilt angle discovered by Voyager results in a configura-
tion that changes dramatically (the tail current sheet changes from a plane to a cylinder) over
the 16-h rotation period (>Fig. 6-18).
The large range of the “solar wind angle” (see the last row of
> Table 6-2) indicates
that substantial changes in orientation of the planet’s spin with respect to the radial direction of
the solar wind occur over the (long) orbital periods of these planets. Thus, one has the interest-
ing challenge of imagining how the magnetosphere of Uranus was behaving during equinox in
2007, when the spin axis was perpendicular to the solar wind direction (and parallel or antipar-
allel to the IMF direction). Unfortunately, we are unlikely to have measurements in the near
future to test the output of our imaginations. Such speculations are not wasted, however, since
it is quite possible that such configurations – and many others – could have occurred in ear-
lier epochs of Earth’s history (as modeled by Zieger et al. 2004) or may now be occurring in
any of the giant planets detected in other solar systems. Furthermore, keen young scientists are
proposing missions to these water giant planets that might test these ideas in future decades
(Arridge et al. 2011).

Small Magnetospheres
The smallest objects with internal dynamos are Mercury and Ganymede. These mini-
magnetospheres were reviewed by Kivelson (2007). The small innermost planet and the solar
system’s largest moon are about the same size and both are believed to have iron cores.
Approximately dipolar magnetic fields have been detected; these hold off the surrounding
plasma flow to make small but distinct magnetospheres.

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
293
Both Mercury and Ganymede rotate slowly so that neither has a plasmasphere. But in
both cases, a significant population of energetic (10s–100s kev) particles have been detected
in trapped radiation belts. These energetic particles are likely accelerated in mini-substorms
in their magnetotails, but the particles are easily scattered onto the object and probably do
not spend more than a few minutes in the magnetospheres. The interaction with these objects
with their surroundings is largely between the ambient and dipolar magnetic field. The corre-
sponding time scales for such a Dungey cycle (see >Fig. 6-9) is seconds to minutes in these
mini-magnetospheres, rather than minutes to hours at Earth.
4.1 Mercury
Just two brief flybys by Mariner 10 in the early 1970s gave a glimpse of Mercury’s mag-
netosphere (see review by Slavin et al. 2007). These early observations revealed a magne-
tosphere that, while small, seemed to have most of the main properties observed at Earth
(> Fig. 6-5), including a small population of trapped energetic particles, mini-substorms,
and particle injections from the magnetotail, basically consistent with simple magnetospheric
scaling laws (Slavin et al. 2010). The arrival of the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2011 and the
future launch of the Bebi Colombo mission have provoked further thought about this largely
forgotten little magnetosphere. Preliminary results from MESSENGER have revealed and
the dipole is tilted less than 3○but offset northward by ± km, nearly 20% of the radius
(Anderson et al. 2011). The small magnetosphereis very dynamic with dramatic changes occur-
ring on time scales of seconds to minutes (Slavin et al. 2010). Slavin et al. (2009) determined
that the rate of reconnection at Mercury’s dayside magnetopause to be ∼10 times that typi-
cal at Earth, most probably a result of the low solar wind Alfven Mach number and values
of plasma β (see Sect. 2.4.3) typical of the inner heliosphere (Slavin and Holzer 1979). The
structure and dynamics of the magnetotail resemble the Earth, responding to changes in IMF
direction but on shorter time scales and greater intensity, including quasiperiodic ejection of
plasmoids down the tail (Slavin et al. 2010). Issues that MESSENGER will address will be how
plasma is trapped and accelerated in this tiny magnetosphere, how it responds to the increasing
dynamics of the new solar cycle, and how the magnetosphere couples to a planet that has such
a tenuous atmosphere/ionosphere.
4.2 Ganymede
Ganymede’s magnetosphere sits deep within the magnetosphere of Jupiter (for the background
and discussion of Galileo observations see Kivelson et al. 2004). Unlike the supersonic flows
of the solar wind, the magnetospheric plasma impinging on Ganymede is subsonic and sub-
Alfvenic. There is no upstream bow shock, therefore, and the flowing magnetospheric plasma
convects Jupiter’s magnetic field, which is roughly antiparallel to that of Ganymede, toward the
upstream magnetopause.The net result is a unique magnetospheric configuration with a region
near the equator of magnetic flux that closes on the moon and with polar magnetic flux that
connects the moon to Jupiter’s north and south ionospheres (>Fig. 6-19a, b). A Dungey-style
reconnection cycle seems to operate: upstream reconnection opens previously closed flux,
convects flux tubes over Ganymede’s pole, and re-closes the flux downstream (see >Fig. 6-10).

Computer simulations are helpful in visualizing the interaction process (Paty and Winglee
2006; Paty et al. 2008; Jia et al. 2008, 2009, 2010a), but lack of information about the conduc-
tivities of Ganymede’s tenuous patchy atmosphere and icy surface limit our understanding of
the circuit of electrical currents that couple the magnetosphere to the moon. It is clear that
electrical currents reach Jupiter, however, because of the strong auroral emissions (>Fig. 6-14)
at the Ganymede footprint (Clarke et al. 2002; Grodent et al. 2009). Short-term (few seconds)
variability of aurora at Jupiter associated with the magnetic footprint of Ganymede (Grodent
et al. 2009) is perhaps associated with bursty reconnection on the upstream side of Ganymede’s
magnetosphere(Jia et al. 2010a). The local interaction also bombards electrons into Ganymede’s
atmosphere, exciting auroral emissions (reviewed by McGrath et al. 2004) as shown in
> Fig. 6-19c. The locations of the aurora on Ganymede are consistent with the boundaries

between regions where the magnetic flux tubes connect at both ends to Ganymede and regions
where the flux tubes connect to Ganymede on one end and Jupiter at the other.

Induced Magnetospheres
Having discussed the seven objects that have internally generated magnetic fields, we return
to the objects without dynamos. The nature of the interaction between such bodies and the
plasma in which they are embedded depends on the Mach number of the surrounding flow but
is determined principally by the electrical conductivity of the body. If conducting paths exist
across the planet’s interior or ionosphere, then electric currents flow through the body and into
the surrounding plasma, where they create forces that slow and divert the incident flow. In the
case of an object sitting in the supersonic solar wind, the flow diverts around a region that
is similar to a planetary magnetosphere. Mars and Venus have ionospheres that provide the
required conducting paths.
Earth’s Moon, with no ionosphere and a very low-conductivity surface, does not deflect the
bulk of the solar wind incident on it. Instead, the solar wind runs directly into the surface, where
it is absorbed. The absorption leaves the region immediately downstream of the Moon in the
flowing plasma (the wake) devoid of plasma, but the void fills in as solar wind plasma flows
toward the center of the wake. When the flow impinging on an object is subsonic, no upstream
shock forms. But the flow will be absorbed or diverted depending on whether electrical cur-
rents flow within the object or within its ionosphere and into the surrounding plasma. Objects
interacting with subsonic flow are exemplified by Io; similar processes occur, albeit to a lesser
extent, at Enceladus, Titan, Triton, Europa, and several satellites embedded in the giant planet
magnetospheres.
5.1 Venus
The magnetic structure surrounding Venus is similar to that around magnetized objects because
the interaction causes the magnetic field of the solar wind to drape around the planet (see review
by Russell et al. 2006). The draped field stretches out downstream (away from the sun), forming
a magnetotail (>Fig. 6-20a). The symmetry of the magnetic configuration within such a tail is
governed by the orientation of the magnetic field in the incident solar wind, and that orientation
changes with time. For example, if the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is oriented from
east to west, then the symmetry plane (and central current sheet) of the tail is in the north–
south direction, and the eastern lobe field points toward the sun while the western lobe field
points away from the sun. A west-to-east-oriented IMF would reverse these polarities, and other
orientations would produce rotations of the tail’s plane of symmetry.
The solar wind brings in magnetic flux tubes that pile up at high altitudes at the dayside
ionopause where, depending on the solar wind’s dynamic pressure, they may either remain
for extended times, thus producing a magnetic barrier that diverts the incident solar wind, or
penetrate to low altitudes in localized bundles. Such localized bundles of magnetic flux are often
highly twisted structures stretched out along the direction of the magnetic field. Such structures
are referred to as flux ropes. These flux ropes maybe dragged deep into the atmosphere, possibly
carrying away significant amounts of atmosphere (>Fig. 6-20b).

ders and Russell 1986). (b) Schematic illustration of a ﬂux rope, a magnetic structure that has been
identiﬁed in the ionosphere of Venus. The rope has an axis aligned with the direction of the cen-
tral ﬁeld. Radially away from the center, the ﬁeld wraps around the axis, its helicity increasing with
radial distance from the axis of the rope. Structures of this sort are also found in the solar corona
and in the magnetotails of magnetized planets
The Venus Express mission has measured the solar wind interaction with Venus revealed
some important subtleties. Barabash et al. (2007) report escape of 10protons/s down Venus’
tail. If these ions come from the dissociation and escape of water, then Venus is losing 15 kg/s
of water. Delva et al. (2011) use the presence of ion cyclotron waves as evidence of pickup of
ionized escaping gases. From analysis of magnetometer data, Zhang et al. (2010) have revealed
asymmetries in the magnetotail. By modeling the interaction with a hybrid code (where the
electrons are treated as a fluid and the ions as particles), Jarvinen et al. (2010) showed that the
large gyroradius of O+ ions produces an asymmetric tail. Finally, Volwerk et al. (2009, 2010)
reports evidence of what could be called substorm activity in Venus’ tail.

5.2 Mars
While Mars’ remarkablystrong remanent magnetism in its crust extends its influence >1,000km
from the surface, the overall interaction of the solar wind with Mars is more atmospheric than
magnetospheric (see reviews by Nagy et al. 2004 and Brain 2006). Mars interacts with the solar
wind principally through currents that link to the ionosphere, but there are portions of the
surface over which local magnetic fields block the access of the solar wind to low altitudes
(>Fig. 6-21). It has been suggested that “mini-magnetospheres” extending up to 1,000 km form
above the regions of intense crustal magnetization in the southern hemisphere; these mini-
magnetospheresprotect portions of the atmosphere from direct interaction with the solar wind.
As a result, the crustal magnetization may have modified the evolution of the atmosphere and
may still modify energy deposition into the upper atmosphere.
Several processes involved in the solar wind interaction could have contributed to atmo-
spheric losses at Mars. The outer neutral atmospheres of Venus and Mars extend out into
the solar wind where neutral atoms are photoionized and carried away by the solar wind.
Newly ionized ions pick up substantial energy and correspondingly large gyroradii. These
energetic ions bombard the upper atmosphere, causing heating and ionization. At times of par-
ticularly high solar wind pressure, the ionosphere can be stripped away in the solar wind. Fresh
ionization in the upstream solar wind also generates plasma waves. The solar wind convects

the plasma waves toward the planet and into the upper layers of the ionosphere where, fun-
neled and amplified by localized magnetic fields, they heat the ions and drive ion outflows, in
a similar way to processes in the polar regions at Earth. Quantitative analyses of these different
processes, both currently occurring and in the past, are active areas of research (see Brain et al.
2010 for comparison of different models) and the scientific target of the MAVEN mission to
Mars (launch 2013).
5.3 Titan
With a thick atmosphere and a significant ionosphere, one expects Titan to have an induced
magnetosphere similar to that of Venus. Orbiting Saturn at 20 RS, Titan spends most of the time
within the magnetosphere, but when the solar wind compresses the magnetosphere, Titan can
spend some ofits orbit in the magnetospheath orsolarwind. The Voyager2 flybyin 1980 showed
that the magnetospheric plasma was deflected and absorbed, the magnetic field draped around
Titan pretty much as expected (see review by Neubauer et al. 1984). The multiple flybys of Titan
by the Cassini spacecraft are showing that the situation is more complex, as reviewed by Sittler
et al. (2009)and illustrated bythe sketch in >Fig. 6-22. There seems tobe general agreement that
a total of about 300 kg/s of hydrogen is lost from Titan’s atmosphere, but estimates of the escape
rate of heavier species range from 5 to 85 kg/s (Johnson et al. 2009). The interaction seems to
vary significantly with local time and the upstream conditions, and it will require combining the
multiple Cassini flybys with models of the interaction before we have a clear consistent picture
(Sittler et al. 2009). Nevertheless, it is already clear that the plasma interaction is a significant
source of energy as well as a cause of escape for Titan’s thick atmosphere (Westlake et al. 2011;
Bell et al. 2011).
5.4 Io
The discovery of Io’s broad influences on the jovian system predated spacecraft explorations.
Bigg (1964) discovered Io’s controlling influence over Jupiter’s decametric radio emissions.
Brown and Chaffee (1974) observed sodium emission from Io, which (Trafton et al. 1974) soon
demonstrated to come from extended neutral clouds and not Io itself. Soon thereafter, Kupo
et al. (1976) detected emissions from sulfur ions, which Brown (1976) recognized as coming
from a dense plasma. With the prediction of volcanism by Peale et al. (1979) just before its dis-
covery by Voyager 1 (Morabito et al. 1979), a consistent picture of Io’s role began to emerge.
Voyager 1’s discovery of Jupiter’s aurora and extreme UV emission from the torus (Broadfoot
et al. 1979), along with its in situ measurements of the magnetosphere (Bridge et al. 1979),
extended our awareness of Io’s effect on the larger system.
The ensuing 25 years of observation by interplanetary missions, Earth-orbiting observato-
ries, and ground-based telescopes has deepened our understanding of Io’s influences (see the
reviews by Thomas et al. 2004 and Schneider and Bagenal 2007). Highlights include Galileo’s
many close flybys of Io, with detailed fields-and-particle measurements of Io’s interaction with
the magnetosphere, and Cassini’s month-long UV observation of the torus. Progress from
Earth-based studies include the Hubble Space Telescope’s sensitive UV observations of the foot-
print aurora and of Io’s atmospheric emissions and ground-based observations of new atomic
and molecular species in Io’s atmosphere and the plasma torus.

⊡Fig. 6-22
Schematic of the processes contributing to source and loss of mass and energy in the plasma
interaction with Titan’s atmosphere (From Sittler et al. 2009)
Over the age of the solar system, the ton/s loss of Iogenic material to the magnetosphere
accumulates to a net decrease in radius of about 2 km. While this loss is significant, Io is not in
danger of running out of SOin the lifetime of the solar system. It is plausible, however, that
other volatile species such as HO were originally present on Io but were completely lost early
in its history through processes now depleting Io of SO.
>Figure 6-23 presents a sketch of the interaction of Io with the surrounding plasma that
illustrates some of the processes. Inelastic collisions of torus ions with Io’s atmosphere heat
the atmospheric gases, causing a significant population of neutral molecules and atoms to gain
speeds above Io’s 2.6 km/s gravitational escape speed. These neutrals form an extensive corona
circling most of the way around Jupiter. Io loses about 1–3 tons of neutral atoms per second.
How much of the neutral escape is in molecular form (SO, SO, or S) as against atomic O or S
is not known.
The various ion–electron–atom interactions each have a key effect on the magnetosphere.
Most importantly torus ions collide with neutral atoms in the atmosphere, which in turn col-
lide with other atoms in the process known as sputtering. Typically, one torus ion can transfer
enough momentum for several atmospheric atoms or molecules to be ejected into Io’s corona
or possibly to escape from Io altogether. This is the primary pathway for material to be supplied
to the neutral clouds and ultimately to the plasma torus. A second key reaction is electron-
impact ionization: a torus electron ionizes an atmospheric atom, which is then accelerated

spheric neutrals, which results in a fresh ion and a high-speed neutral. Elastic collisions between
ions and atoms can also eject material at speeds between those resulting from sputtering
and charge exchange. Finally, electron-impact dissociation breaks down molecules into their
component atoms.
>Figure 6-23 shows that the strong magnetic field of Jupiter affects the interaction in such a
way that the flow around Io resembles fluid flow around a cylinder. (Note that a strong intrinsic

Planetary Magnetospheres 6
301
magnetic field at Io has been ruled out by Galileo flybys over the poles.) Io’s motion through
the plasma creates an electrical current. While its surface or interior may be modestly con-
ducting, the current is more likely to be carried in other conducting materials surrounding Io,
such as its ionosphere and the plasma produced by ionization of its neutral corona. Currents
induced across Io are closed by currents that flow along field lines between Io and Jupiter’s polar
ionosphere in both hemispheres. Observations by the Voyager 1 and Galileo spacecraft indicate
that the net current in each circuit is about 3 million amps. The relative contributions from the
conduction current through Io’s ionosphere and the current generated by ion pickup in the sur-
rounding plasma remains an issue of debate that awaits more sophisticated models (e.g., see the
review by Saur et al. 2004).
A major question regarding Jupiter’s magnetosphere is whether most mass loading happens
in the near-Io interaction or in the broad neutral clouds far from Io. There is no doubt that
substantial pickup occurs near Io, simply owing to the exposure of the upper atmosphere to
pickup by the magnetosphere. Pickup near Io is also supported by evidence of fresh pickup ions
of molecules (SO+
, SO+, S+
, HS+) near Io with dissociation lifetimes of just a few hours. But
a closer look shows that the bulk of the Iogenic source comes from the ionization of atomic
sulfur and oxygen farther from Io. Galileo measurements of the plasma fluxes downstream of
Io suggest that the plasma source from the ionization of material in the immediate vicinity
(within ∼5RIo) of Io is less than 300 kg/s, which is ∼15% of the canonical net tons-per-second
Iogenic source. The remainder must come from ionization of the extended clouds. It is not
clear whether the observations were made during a typical situation, nor it is well established
how much the net source and relative contributions of local and distant processes vary with Io’s
volcanic activity.
While most impacting plasma is diverted to Io’s flanks, some is locked to field lines that
are carried through Io itself. This ∼10% of upstream plasma is rapidly decelerated and moves
slowly (∼3–7 km/s) over the poles. Most particles are absorbed by the moon or its tenuous polar
atmosphere, so that the almost-stagnant polar flux tubes are evacuated of plasma. Downstream
of Io, the Galileo instruments detected a small trickle of the cold dense ionospheric plasma
that had been stripped away. This cold dense “tail” had a dramatic signature (>10 times the
background density), but the nearly stagnant flow (∼1 km/s) means that the net flux of this cold
ionospheric material is at most a few percent of the Iogenic source and quickly couples to the
surrounding torus plasma.
The strong electrodynamic interaction generates Alfven waves that propagate away from
Io along the magnetic field (reviewed by Saur et al. 2004). Other MHD modes that propagate
perpendicularly to the field dissipate within a short distance. The intense auroral emission in
Jupiter’s atmosphere at each “foot” of the flux tube (> Fig. 6-14) connected to Io tells us that
electrons are accelerated somewhere between Io and the atmosphere. The strong correlation
of decametric radio emissions with Io’s location also tells us that electrons stream away from
Jupiter along the Io flux tube and field lines downstream of Io. But how much of the Alfven wave
energy propagates through the torus and reaches Jupiter is not known. MHD models suggest
that much of the wave energy is reflected at the sharp latitudinal gradients of density in the
torus. Furthermore, how the Alfven wave evolves as it moves through the very low-density
region between the torus and Jupiter’s ionosphere is far from understood. Early ideas suggested
that multiple bounces of the Alfven wave between ionospheres of opposite hemispheres could
explain the repetitive bursts of radio emission. More recent studies suggest that the process is
more complex, however, with the filamentation of Alfven waves and the development of quasi-
static potential structures (see review by Hess et al. 2010 and references therein).

Planetary Magnetospheres
5.5 Pluto and Comets
Last but not least, there are planetaryobjects with escaping atmospheres that extend well beyond
their solid surface. The neutral atoms and molecules are ionized by solar photons or charge
exchange with solar wind protons. The fresh ions are picked up by the solar wind and carried
downstream. Momentum is extracted from the solar wind and the IMF that is embedded in
the slowed-down flow is stretched out behind the object in a magnetotail, similar to that of
Venus shown in > Fig. 6-20. The weak solar magnetic field at ∼30 AU means that the gyro-
motions of the newly picked up ions are very large compared to the Pluto system so that a
kinetic (or hybrid) approach must be applied in modeling the interaction (see Delamere 2009
and references therein). >Figure 6-24 is a sketch of the extended interaction region. The New
Horizons spacecraft will fly past Pluto in 2015 and the particle instruments on board (McComas
et al. 2008; McNutt et al. 2008) will determine how close this sketch bears to reality.

Outstanding Questions
The tables presented in this chapter quantify the characteristics of the seven magnetospheres of
our solar system. The schematics give a glimpse of the diversity of their natures. While magne-
tospheres must share the same underlying basic physical processes, it is the application to very
different conditions at the different planets that makes the study of planetary magnetospheres
so interesting and tests our understanding. Below are the major outstanding questions:
⊡Fig. 6-24
Comet-like interaction of Pluto’s escaping atmosphere with the tenuous solar wind at 30 AU. The
contours are of ion density. The weak solar magnetic ﬁeld results in a kinetic process whereby
the ions produced by ionization of Pluto’s escaping atmosphere exhibit large cycloidal motions,
illustrated by sample trajectories in grey lines

Abstract:
Planetary rings are the only nearby astrophysical disks and the only disks that have
been investigated by spacecraft (especially the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn). Although
there are significant differences between rings and other disks, chiefly the large planet/ring mass
ratio that greatly enhances the flatness of rings (aspect ratios as small as −), understanding of
disks in general can be enhanced by understanding the dynamical processes observed at close
range and in real time in planetary rings.
We review the known ring systems of the four giant planets, as well as the prospects for ring
systems yet to be discovered. We then review planetary rings by type. The A, B, and C rings of
Saturn, plus the Cassini Division, comprise our solar system’s only dense broad disk and host
many phenomena of general application to disks including spiral waves, gap formation, self-
gravity wakes, viscous overstability and normal modes, impact clouds, and orbital evolution of
embedded moons. Dense narrow rings are found both at Uranus (where they comprise the main
rings entirely) and at Saturn (where they are embedded in the broad disk) and are the primary
natural laboratory for understanding shepherding and self-stability. Narrow dusty rings, likely
generated by embedded source bodies, are surprisingly found to sport azimuthally confined
arcs at Neptune, Saturn, and Jupiter. Finally, every known ring system includes a substantial
component of diffuse dusty rings.
Planetary rings have shown themselves to be useful as detectors of planetary processes
around them, including the planetary magnetic field and interplanetary impactors as well as
the gravity of nearby perturbing moons. Experimental rings science has made great progress in
recent decades, especially numerical simulations of self-gravity wakes and other processes but
also laboratory investigations of coefficient of restitution and spectroscopic ground truth. The
age of self-sustained ring systems is a matter of debate; formation scenarios are most plausible
in the context of the early solar system, while signs of youthfulness indicate at least that rings
have never been static phenomena.

Introduction
Planetary rings come in a diverse array of shapes and sizes. They may be broad or narrow, dense
or tenuous, dusty or not, and they may contain various kinds of structures including arcs, wavy
edges, embedded moonlets, and radial variations. Rings share the defining characteristic of a
swarm of objects orbiting a central planet with vertical motions that are small compared to
their motions within a common plane. The latter arises because planets in our solar system
(with the exceptions of Mercury and Venus, which have no known natural material in orbit) are
fast-enough rotaters that their shapes are dominated by an equatorial bulge that adds a strong
quadrupole moment (J) to their gravity fields (see >Sect. 1.1).
This is a major contrast between rings and other astrophysical disks, which are not defined
by asymmetry in an external gravity field but by the average angular momentum of the disk
itself (in both cases, once a preferred plane is established, collisions among particles damp out
the motions perpendicular to it). However, rings do have a number of similarities with other
astrophysical disks, which add to the motivation for studying them. Unlike other known disk
systems that are either many light-years away or (like the early stages of our solar system) far
back in time, planetary rings can be studied up close and in real time. Thus, it is worthwhile to
consider the parallels that can be drawn between planetary rings and the study of other disks
(see >Sect. 6).

Planetary Rings
In this chapter, after some further introductory notes on important concepts
( > Sects. 1.1, >1.2, and >1.3), we will give an overview of the known ring systems, as well
as systems where rings are unconfirmed but plausible, in >Sect. 2. More detailed descriptions
can be found in >Sect. 3, which contains a discussion of various ring structures organized by
type, with a focus on finding commonalities among rings in different locations that share cer-
tain qualities. In >Sect. 4, we will discuss experimental methods of learning about rings, and
in >Sect. 5, we will discuss the age and origin of ring systems. Finally, in >Sect. 6, we will
discuss ways that planetary rings can illuminate the study of other astrophysical disks.
1.1 Orbital Elements
Rings are fundamentally populations of orbiting material. Therefore, to discuss structure within
rings, we will occasionally refer to one or more of the six orbital elements that describe the orbit
of any object around another object. These six parameters are simply a transformation of the six
Cartesian parameters for position and velocity (x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, and ˙z) under the assumption that
the object moves in the gravity field of a point mass (hereafter the “planet”). The derivation can
be found in any textbook on orbital mechanics (e.g., Sect. 2.8 in Murray and Dermott 1999).
A diagram of the orbit in space is found in >Fig. 7-1. The size of the orbit, and its grav-
itational potential energy, is described by the semimajor axis a, which is the mean distance
between the orbiting particle and the planet. The shape of the orbit is described by the eccen-
tricity e; for a circular orbit e = , but real orbits that remain bound to the planet take elliptical
shapes with < e < , with most ring particles having e ≪. Unbound orbits, either parabolic
or hyperbolic, have e ≥. The orbit plane may be inclined with respect to the reference plane
(for ring applications, this is often the planet’s equatorial plane), by an angle known as the incli-
nation I. A nonzero inclination requires an account of the orbit plane’s orientation, and thus
its line of intersection with the reference plane (the “line of nodes”) is described by the longi-
tude of the ascending node Ω, measured with respect to a reference axis. Similarly, a nonzero
eccentricity requires an account of the orientation of the ellipse within the orbit plane, and thus
the line connecting the planet to the location of the particle’s closest approach (its “periapse”)
is described by the argument of periapse ω. Finally, once the orbit has been defined by the five

parameters already mentioned, the particle’s position along the orbit can be given by its actual
position (the true anomaly f ) or its time-averaged position (the mean anomaly M) relative to
periapse. Also commonly used are the longitude of periapse ϖ = Ω + ω and the mean longitude
λ = Ω + ω + M, which are not physical angles since they are the sums of angles not necessarily
in the same plane, but they have the virtue of being reckoned from a stationary reference axis
rather than a moving line and are useful as long as I is not too large.
The osculating orbital elements, which are most simply calculated and most often used,
assume that the planet’s gravity field is that of a point mass. But for ring applications, the
known planets are oblate (or bulged at the equators) due to their fast rotation. This is adequately
described by adding to the account of the gravity field a positive quadrupole moment J(for
details see, e.g., Sect. 4.5 of Murray and Dermott 1999), though it may be necessary to further
include higher moments for applications requiring great precision. The presence of a nonzero
J, in addition to defining the Laplace plane1 for orbits near the planet, causes orbits to precess,
in the prograde direction for apses ( ˙ϖ > ) and in the retrograde direction for nodes ( ˙Ω < ).
A nonzero Jalso compromises the physical meaningfulness of the osculating elements,
especially for low-eccentricity orbits, introducing fast (i.e., orbit-frequency) variations in all
six elements. The physical meaningfulness of orbital elements can be restored using a revised
system of epicyclic orbital elements (Borderies and Longaretti 1987; Longaretti and Borderies
1991; Borderies-Rappaport and Longaretti 1994), which are based on the geometrical shape
of streamlines. These put the orbit-frequency variations back into an analogue of λ, leaving the
other five elementsto again describe a static (or at least slowly varying) orbit. A useful algorithm
for converting Cartesian coordinates into epicyclic orbital elements was devised by Renner and
Sicardy (2006).
1.2 Roche Limits, Roche Lobes, and Roche Critical Densities
The “Roche limit” is the distance from a planet within which its tides can pull apart a compact
object. Simply speaking, a ring would be expected to reside inside its planet’s Roche limit, while
any disk of material beyond that distance would be expected to accrete into one or more moons.
However, the Roche limit does not actually have a single value but depends particularly on the
density and internal material strength of the moon that may or may not get pulled apart (Canup
and Esposito 1995). A simple value for the Roche limit can be calculated from a balance between
the tidal force (i.e., the difference between the planet’s gravitational pull on one side of the moon
and its pull on the other side) that would tend to pull a moon apart, and the moon’s own gravity
that would tend to hold it together. This works out to (e.g., Eq. 4.131 in Murray and Dermott
1999)
aRoche = Rp (πρp
γρ )
/
,
(7.1)
where R is radius and ρ is internal density, and the subscript “p” denotes the central planet.
The dimensionless geometrical parameter γ = π/≈.for a sphere but is smaller for an
object that takes a nonspherical shape with its long axis pointing toward Saturn, as one would
expect for an actively accreting body and as at least several of Saturn’s ring-moons appear to

will settle into a ring centered on the Laplace plane.

do (Porco et al. 2007; Charnoz et al. 2007). Simply distributing the moon’s material into the
shape of its Roche lobe, with uniform density, yields γ ≈.(Porco et al. 2007). However, fully
accounting for the feedback between the moon’s distorted shape and its (now non-point-mass)
gravity field (Chandrasekhar1969; see, e.g., Murray and Dermott 1999) leads to a rather smaller
value, γ ≈.; on the other hand, some central mass concentration and the failure of a rubble
pile to exactly take its equilibrium shape will likely prevent γ from becoming quite this low.
Note that the moon’s internal density ρ appears in ( >7.1). Thus, the Roche limit is variable;
a denser object can venture closer to the planet without danger than can an object that is less
dense. The moon’s diameter, on the other hand, does not appear in ( > 7.1). Why then do we
commonly imagine a large object getting pulled into smaller pieces when it ventures inside the
Roche limit? This is because the Roche limit has been defined here as the distance within which
an object can no longer be held together by its own gravity. Size becomes relevant for objects
small enough to be held together by their internal material strength (which is not considered
in ( > 7.1)) in spite of the tidal forces that enter into the Roche calculation.
In fact, it is often more useful in the context ofrings toconsiderthe limit from planetarytides
not as a critical distance but as a critical density. At any given distance a from the planet, there
is a Roche critical density ρRoche at which the moon’s size entirely fills its region of gravitational
dominance (its “Roche lobe” or “Hill sphere” of characteristic radius rHill). We can rearrange
( > 7.1) to obtain
rHill = a ( m
Mp
)
/
(7.2)
and
ρRoche =
πρp
γ(a/Rp)= Mp
γa,
(7.3)
where m and Mp are the masses of the moon and planet, respectively. The first expression for
ρRoche is the most useful for interpreting >Fig. 7-2.
Within a ring, where material for accretion is plentiful, any preexisting solid chunk with
internal density greater than ρRoche should accrete a mantle of porous ring material until its
density decreases to match ρRoche. This process should govern the size and density of the largest
disk-embedded objects (Porco et al. 2007; Charnoz et al. 2007). On the other hand, the density
naturallyachieved bytransient clumps should be compared to ρRoche in ordertopredict whether
disruption (rings) or accretion (discrete moons) will dominate in a particular location, and the
persistent existence of a ring implies that the densities of transient clumps do not exceed ρRoche
(i.e., we expect ρ ≲ρRoche). As seen in >Fig. 7-2, Saturn’s rings extend outward to significantly
lower values of ρRoche, approaching 0.4 g cm−, than are seen in any of the other three known
ring systems, probably reflecting their much lower rock fraction (and higher fraction of water
ice) as already known from spectroscopy and photometry (Cuzzi et al. 2009). That ρRoche for
Saturn’s rings reaches values much lower even than the density of solid water ice indicates a
high degree of porosity, which is not surprising for a system in balance between disruption and
accretion.
If the outeredge of a ring system is taken to be the transition between disruption-dominated
and accretion-dominated regions, which is probably true at least for Saturn and Uranus given
the large number of moons immediately outward of their main rings, and if the porosity of
accreting objects is relatively constant among the different systems, then differences in ρRoche
at the transition location probably reflect differences in bulk composition. Since Uranus has a
transitional ρRoche three times that of Saturn (> Fig. 7-2), we may well infer that its rings are

Roche critical density ρRoche (( >7.3), with γ = 1.6) plotted against planetary radii for Jupiter (red),
Saturn (cyan), Uranus (green), and Neptune (blue). An object must have density higher than ρRoche
to be held together by its own gravity; conversely, in the presence of abundant disk material, an
embedded object will actively accrete as long as its density remains higher than ρRoche. The colored
bars along the bottom and along the left-hand side show the extent of each planet’s main ring
system. For each, a solid circle indicates the outermost extent, and the corresponding minimum
ρRoche, of the main rings
made of material with a higher grain density, i.e., a significantly higher rock/ice ratio. Neptune’s
transitional ρRoche is intermediatebetween Saturn’s and Uranus’, possibly indicating an interme-
diate rock/ice ratio. Our inference, from the Roche critical density at the ring/moon transition,
that the Uranus system is rockier overall than the Saturn system is consistent with the fact that
the average density of Saturn’s mid-size moons (Matson et al. 2009) is 1.2 g cm−, while that
of Uranus’ major moons (Jacobson et al. 1992) is 1.6 g cm−. We cannot test our inference that
Neptune’s rock/ice ratio is intermediate in this way, as Neptune has no indigenous major moons
due to the cataclysm of Triton’s capture (Goldreich et al. 1989).
The extent of Jupiter’s Main ring, in contrast to the other three ring systems, is clearly lim-
ited by the availability of material (which originates at source moons Metis and Adrastea and
evolves inward, and which is not abundant) rather than by a disruption/accretion balance.
However, its high value of ρRoche ∼.g cm−places the only known limit on the densities
(and thus masses) of the source moons. However, it may not be valid to assume that Metis
and Adrastea are held together by gravity, as accreting masses must be, given the large gap in
particle size between the ∼10-km moons and other Main ring particles, which observation-
ally cannot be larger than 1 km (Showalter et al. 2007). This large gap in particle size might be
explained if Metis and Adrastea are solid bodies originating further out, now held together
by material strength, while no bodies of similar size are now able to form through in situ
accretion.

1.3 Optical Depth
The amount of material in a system with general disk morphology can be measured in several
ways. The most straightforward is the surface density, the mass per unit surface area of the disk,
though it must be borne in mind that a disk with greater vertical thickness will have propor-
tionately lower volume density than a vertically thin disk, even if both have the same surface
density. However, surface density can be difficult to measure directly. A much more common
observable is the optical depth τ, which can be thought of as the attenuation of a beam of light
passing through the disk, measured in e-folding terms. That is,
τ = −ln ( I
I∗
) ≡−ln T,
(7.4)
where I is the observed intensity, I∗is the unocculted intensity (e.g., from a background star),
and the ratio between them is defined as the ring’s transparency T.
The optical depth is sensitive to both the number density and the size of ring particles, which
can be obtained when both the optical depth and the surface density are known (e.g., Colwell
et al. 2009a). For a given value of the surface mass density, the optical depth scales inversely
with particle size, that is, with the ratio of volume to surface area.
For a vertically thick homogeneous disk, the optical depth is proportional to the path length
through the disk, which in turn is proportional to μ ≡sin B, where the elevation angle B is the
angle between the line-of-sight and the ring plane (>Fig. 7-3a). In order to compare observa-
tions taken over a range of elevation angles, the normal optical depth, τ⊥≡μτ, is often used.
However, this parameter must be used with caution for disks that lack homogeneity and/or are
close to a single layer thick. Colwell et al. (2007) found that τ⊥varies strongly with μ in the B ring
and that the uncorrected τ is a more robust parameter in that case, indicating that the B ring is
composed of vertically thin nearly opaque clumps with nearly transparent gaps between them
(>Fig. 7-3b), and that the optical depth is controlled by the relative abundance of clumps and
gaps (see >Sect. 3.1.4).
In numerical simulations (see >Sect. 4.1), the photometric optical depth τ ( >7.4) is cum-
bersome to calculate, but a useful proxy known as the dynamical optical depth τdyn can be found
by summing the total cross-section area of all simulated particles and dividing by the area of the
simulation patch. This quantity turns out to be equal to the photometric optical depth as long
as particles are randomly distributed, as the Gaussian probability of particle overlap plays the

(left) a homogeneous ring and (right) ﬂattened self-gravity wakes (SGWs). The measured optical
depth τ is proportional to sin B in the ﬁrst case, but is relatively insensitive to elevation angle in the
second. Figure created with the rebound software package (Rein and Liu 2012)

same role when using τdyn to calculate the total transparency that the exponential plays when
using ( > 7.4). However, for high values of τ, when the distance between particles becomes
comparable to the particle size, particles become constrained as to the locations in space they
can occupy and the two quantities diverge. Specifically,
τ/τdyn ≃+ kD,
(7.5)
where the volume filling factor D is calculated from particle radius, disk scale height, and τdyn,
and k is a scalar of order unity (Salo and Karjalainen 2003; Tiscareno et al. 2010a). Furthermore,
the existence of microstructure such as self-gravity wakes causes the distribution of particles
to be strongly nonrandom, and can cause τdyn to diverge strongly from the photometrically
observed τ.

Rings by Planetary System
2.1 The Rings of Jupiter
Jupiter is adorned by the simplest of the known ring systems. All of its rings are tenuous and
composed of dust-sized2 particles. As the only confirmed ring system without any dense com-
ponent, and by far the least massive (Burns et al. 2004), Jupiter’s is the only ring system to have
been discovered by spacecraft without having previously been seen from Earth either directly
(as Saturn’s) or by stellar occultations (as Uranus’ and Neptune’s). The Main ring was first clearly
described from Voyager 1 images (Owen et al. 1979) after initial hints from charged-particle
detectors aboard Pioneer 11 (Fillius et al. 1975; Acuna and Ness 1976; Burns et al. 2004).
The basic structure of Jupiter’s rings is well understood (see Burns et al. 2004, for a recent
comprehensive review). The Main ring and the two Gossamer rings are like three nested “tuna
cans” (>Fig. 7-4), with radius set by the semimajor axis (a) of the ring’s source moon and ver-
tical height by the moon’s vertical excursions relative to Jupiter’s equatorial plane (a sin I, for
⊡Fig. 7-4

in order to show the increasingly faint structure (Figure from Ockert-Bell et al. 1999)

inclination I). Particles enter the ring as ejecta from micrometeoroid impacts onto the moon
(Burns et al. 1999) and begin with orbital parameters a, e, and I (see >Sect. 1.1) similar to the
moon’s. The tuna-can structure arises as the orientations of particles’ orbit planes (Ω) become
quickly randomized due to small variations in a and thus in the precession rate. Particles evolve
inward underPoynting-Robertson drag (Burns et al. 1999), thus filling out the cylindrical shape.
A double-layered vertical structure arises dynamically because any orbiting particle spends
more time at its vertical maxima than it does in the midplane. The increasing vertical thick-
ness of the rings arises because Amalthea’s inclination is larger than that of Metis or Adrastea,
while Thebe in turn has an even larger inclination.
The two Gossamer rings consist entirely of material evolving inward in this way, though the
Thebe Gossamer ring has an additional segment extending slightly outward from Thebe’s orbit,
which has been attributed to charging and discharging of grains as they pass into and out of
the planet’s shadow (Hamilton and Krüger 2008). Further inward, the ∼1,000-km-wide core of
the Main ring contains a significant population of cm-size and larger particles lying between
the orbits of Adrastea and Metis. This core, which is the only component of the ring system not
composed of dust and the only one that appears bright at low phase angles,3 is composed of
several ringlets (including one lying just outside Adrastea’s orbit), whose cause is not known.
New Horizons imaging limits the sizes of objects in this belt to be <1 km (Showalter et al. 2007) –
other than Adrastea and Metis themselves, which have mean radii of 8 and 22 km, respectively.
However, Showalter et al. (2007) did find several azimuthal clumps in a ringlet just inward of
Adrastea (see >Sect. 3.5). A dusty component of the Main ring extends inward of its core, also
evolving under Poynting-Robertson drag (>Fig. 7-5).
⊡Fig. 7-5

panel), respectively showing the structures composed of macroscopic particles and the dusty
envelope (Credit: NASA)
3The phase angle is formed by the Sun-object-observer lightpath. Dust-sized particles, having size comparable to the wavelength of visible
light, tend to diffract light forward and are brightest at high phase angles. Larger objects tend to reflect light and are brightest at low phase
angles.

319
The dusty component of the Main ring has a vertical scale height that increases monoton-
ically with decreasing distance to Jupiter (Ockert-Bell et al. 1999). When the inward-moving
material reaches a radius of 122,800 km from Jupiter’s center, it becomes strongly affected by a
3:2 “Lorentz resonance” (Burns et al. 1985) between its orbital period and the rotation period of
Jupiter’s magnetic field. Inward of this location, the vertical extent of the ring increases dramati-
cally, forming the toroidal Halo ring. Material in the Halo ranges tens of thousands of kilometers
above Jupiter’s ring plane, though most of its material is concentrated within just a few hundred
kilometers (Burns et al. 2004).
2.2 The Rings of Saturn
Saturn possesses by far the most massive and the most diverse of the known ring systems
(> Fig. 7-6). The only ring system known before recent decades, Saturn’s rings were among
the first objects observed through a telescope, by Galileo Galilei in 1610, explicated as a disk by
Christiaan Huygens, proved to consist of individual particles on independent orbits by James
Clerk Maxwell, and have in general been the focus of much productive study by astronomers
over the past four centuries (Alexander 1962; Van Helden 1984; Miner et al. 2007). The main
part of the rings comprises the solar system’s only known broad and dense disk ( >Sect. 3.1),
which was found by G. D. Cassini to be divided into two parts – now called the A and B rings,
separated by what is now called the Cassini Division. Furthermore, the latter is now known to
⊡Fig. 7-6
This Cassini image mosaic shows Saturn’s tenuous D, E, and G rings with comparable brightness
to the main disk, which occurs because the viewing geometry is at high phase angle (in fact, in
eclipse) and also views the unlit face of the main disk. The darkest part of the main disk is actually
the densest and most opaque, namely, the mid- to outer-B ring. The Cassini Division is diﬃcult to
distinguish from the A ring in this view. The markings on the planet do not line up with those on
the rings because the latter are due to sunlight ﬁltering directly through the rings while the former
are due to light reﬂected oﬀthe rings, then reﬂected oﬀthe planet, and then ﬁltered through the
rings again. The Sun, which is actually behind Saturn, can be seen refracted through the planet’s
atmosphere at 7 o’clock. Enceladus (actually, only its geyser plume is bright in this geometry) can
be seen embedded in the E ring at 8 o’clock. The Earth can be seen as a pinpoint of light between
the F and G rings at 10 o’clock (Credit: NASA and M. Hedman, annotated by the author)

be not an empty gap but simply a region of the disk with more moderate surface density, similar
in character to the C ring, which lies inward of the B ring and was discovered in 1850.
There are a small number of truly empty radial gaps in the dense disk of the main rings, most
of them in the C ring and Cassini Division but two in the outer A ring, all of them sharp-edged.
These gaps are named for scientists who have made contributions to the study of Saturn’s rings.
The two A-ring gaps are held open by moons at their centers, and the C ring’s Colombo Gap
is known to be held open by a resonance with Titan, but most of the gaps remain unexplained.
Recent work by Hedman et al. (2010a) suggested that all the Cassini Division gaps are due
to a secondary resonance associated with the Mimas 2:1 resonant mechanism that defines the
nearby outer edge of the B ring, though this idea has yet to be successfully worked out in detail
(Spitale and Porco 2010). A diverse array of narrow rings and ringlets resides within ring gaps,
some of them dense and sharp-edged and others diffuse and/or dusty. They often are given
the same name as the gap within which they reside, though several have been given nicknames.
These structures, which can be compared with narrow rings around other planets, are discussed
in >Sect. 3.2.
The Saturn system also contains the most diverse retinue of tenuous dusty ring structures
known in the solar system, discussed in > Sect. 3.4. The main components, given letters in
order of their discovery, are the D ring situated innermost between the main rings and Saturn’s
atmosphere, the dense F ring ( >Sect. 3.3) just off the edge of the A ring, and the G and E rings
farther out. The region between the A and F rings, now known as the Roche Division,4 contains
a tenuous dusty sheet, and several other rings or ring arcs are named for moons whose orbits
they share.
The largest known ring in the solar system, the Phoebe ring, was recently discovered by the
Spitzer Space Telescope (Verbiscer et al. 2009). This ring is also the only known ring to be tilted
from its planet’s equatorial plane (it lies in the plane of Saturn’s orbit, as solar perturbations
are much more important than Saturn’s Jat its distance) and is likely the only known ring
whose particles orbit in the retrograde direction (if indeed its material is primarily derived
from Phoebe, which orbits retrograde). As particles in the Phoebe ring spiral inward under
Poynting-Robertson drag, they preferentially impact the leading hemisphere of Iapetus (Soter
1974; Tamayo et al. 2011), which, together with solar-driven thermal processing, appears likely
to explain the strong brightness dichotomy on the surface of that moon (Spencer and Denk
2010; Denk et al. 2010).
The end of Cassini’sinitial 4-year mission at Saturn (though its extended mission continues)
has occasioned several recent reviews of Saturn’s rings, including articles by Cuzzi et al. (2010)
and Esposito (2010). A recent comprehensive review in five parts discussed the rings’ structure
(Colwell et al. 2009b), dynamics (Schmidt et al. 2009), particle sizes and composition (Cuzzi
et al. 2009), diffuse rings (Horányi et al. 2009), and origins (Charnoz et al. 2009a), in addition
to a review of pre-Cassini understanding (Orton et al. 2009).
2.3 The Rings of Uranus
All of Uranus’ main rings are narrow, and many are eccentric and/or inclined, unlike the broad
disk of Saturn. On the other hand, many of Uranus’ rings are dense and sharp-edged, unlike
4As recently formalized by the IAU, a “division” is defined as a region between two lettered rings that contains a sheet of material, while a
“gap” is a clear region within a lettered ring that may or may not contain one or more ringlets (http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append8.
html).

Uranus’ main rings are situated immediately inward of a retinue of small moons. If one were to
spread the mass of Uranus’“Portia group”of moons evenly over the annulus they occupy, the sur-
face density would be similar to that of Saturn’s A ring. This moon system may be very similar in
origin to the known ring systems, except that the natural density of accreted objects is larger than
the Roche critical density (i.e., it is beyond the “Roche limit,” see >Fig. 7-2) so that any moon that
gets disrupted by a collision (which ought to have happened many times over the age of the solar
system) will simply reaccrete (Credit: Wikimedia Foundation, annotated by the author)
the diffuse rings of Jupiter. Thus, the Uranian system represents a third paradigm for ring sys-
tems, one that truly deserves the label of “rings” in the plural. The main set of ten narrow rings
(including all the named rings except dusty ζ, ν, and μ) occupies a fairly small radial range from
1.64 to 2.00 RU from Uranus’ center (>Fig. 7-7), inward of Uranus’ 13 small inner moons except
that the innermost moon Cordelia is inward of the є ring. A panoply of unnamed dusty rings
was seen interspersed with the main rings in the single high-resolution high-phase image taken
by Voyager 2 (> Fig. 7-8), and gaps in these have been cited as evidence for additional moons
(Murray and Thompson 1990, 1991). The so-called “Portia group” of eight moons packed into
an annulus from 59,100 to 76,500 km from Uranus’ center (i.e., 2.31–2.99 RU) appears from

This composite image of Uranus’ main rings in forward-scattered (left) and back-scattered (right)
light shows that a network of dust structures is interleaved with the planet’s dense main rings. The

ever successfully taken of Uranus’ rings (by the post-encounter Voyager 2), the detailed workings
of the dust structures remain largely unknown (Credit: NASA and Wikimedia Foundation)
orbital simulations to be dynamically unstable on timescales of –years (Duncan and
Lissauer 1997; Showalter and Lissauer 2006). The dusty ν ring, which lies between two of the
moons in this group, may well be the detritus of a recent significant collision, perhaps the dis-
ruption of a moon. Outward beyond the Portia group, the μ ring is centered on the orbit of Mab
(Showalter and Lissauer 2006; see >Sect. 3.4).
Given their dynamical instability, the Portia group of Uranian moons are probably con-
stantly evolving by means of occasional collisions followed by the reaccretion of material into
new moons (Showalter and Lissauer 2006; Dawson et al. 2010; French and Showalter 2011) and
may have looked rather different from its present configuration over most of solar system his-
tory, though what effect this might have on the main rings is unknown. The contrast between the
main Uranian rings and the Portia group may simply be the difference between a particle pop-
ulation dominated by disruption and one dominated by accretion. The mean surface density of

Planetary Rings 7
323
the Portia group region is ∼45 g cm−, calculated by spreading the moons’ mass evenly over the
annulus containing them. This is comparable to the surface density of dense rings such as Sat-
urn’s A ring, though direct comparisons to the Uranian rings are difficult as the masses of the lat-
ter are poorly known. The Roche critical density (see >Sect. 1.2) for the boundary between the
two regions is 1.2 g cm−, which possibly indicates a high rock fraction, especially considering
the high internal porosity inherent in accretion of small bodies with low central pressures.
The composition of the Uranian rings is almost entirely unknown, as Voyager did not carry
an infrared spectrometer with enough spatial resolution to detect the rings. However, it is clear
from their low albedo that at least the surfaces of the ring particles cannot be primarily water
ice. Color imaging indicates that the Uranian rings are dark at all visible wavelengths, indicating
a spectrum similar to that of carbon.
Most of Uranus’ rings have been given Greek letters (α, β, γ, δ, є, η, λ, ζ, μ, and ν) in order of
their discovery, except for three which are labeled with numbers (4, 5, and 6). This idiosyncratic
system can be traced back to their simultaneous discovery by two different research groups, one
of which (Elliot et al. 1977) labeled the rings with Greek letters while the other (Millis et al. 1977)
numbered them. The former system was given priority for future use, but three of the rings had
not been observed by the former research group and thus retained as their labels the numbers
given to them by their discoverers (Miner et al. 2007).
A comprehensive review of the Uranian rings, up to and including the Voyager 2 encounter,
was published in two parts discussing the rings’ structure (French et al. 1991) and particle
properties (Esposito et al. 1991).
2.4 The Rings of Neptune
Neptune’s ring system, like that of Uranus, consists primarily of a few narrow rings, though
Neptune’s are generally less dense, higher in dust, less sharp in their edges, and farther from
their planet than those of Uranus. Neptune’s rings are named for individuals associated with
the 1846 discovery of Neptune. The Le Verrier, Arago, and Adams rings are narrow, while the
Galle and Lassell rings are tenuous sheets of dust (>Fig. 7-9). The Adams ring, Neptune’s most
substantial, is best known for its series of arcs, the first ever discovered, which are discussed
in >Sect. 3.5.
Unlike those of Saturn and Uranus, Neptune’s ring system is thoroughly interwoven with
known moons. This is at least partly enabled by the fact that Neptune’s rings are the farthest
from their planet, in terms of planetary radii, and have the lowest value of ρRoche at the inner
edge of the ring system (> Fig. 7-2). Still, the presence of rings, rather than accreted moons,
must indicate that the natural density of accreted objects is lower than ρRoche. Thus, it may be
that the ring-moons Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and perhaps Galatea, either originated farther
from the planet than their current position, or accreted in a formerly more dense ring.
The composition of the Neptunian rings, like that of the Uranian rings, is unknown due to
Voyager’s inability to detect them in the infrared. However, again like the Uranian rings, the low
albedo of Neptunian ring particles makes it clear that at least their surfaces cannot be primarily
water ice.
A comprehensive review of the Neptunian rings, up to and including the Voyager 2
encounter, was given by Porco et al. (1995).

2.5 Unconﬁrmed Ring Systems
The fourgiant planets are the onlybodies known tohave rings, as just described. Here we discuss
bodies for which rings have been seriously discussed but not observed.
2.5.1 Mars
Mars has been predicted to have a tenuous ring system comprising dust grains ejected from
its moons Phobos and Deimos by meteoroid impactors (Hamilton 1996; Krivov and Hamilton
1997, and references therein). Simulations by Burns et al. (2001) indicate that Deimos’ ring
should be offset away from the Sun and tilted out of Mars’ equatorial plane by the Sun’s
perturbations. However, attempts to observe rings around Mars have been unsuccessful to

date (Showalter et al. 2006), and the image quality has progressed to the point that some mod-
els can now be observationally excluded. The lack of dust could be due to dust production rates
being lower than expected, or the lifetimes of dust particles being shorter than expected. Solar
radiation pressure limits the lifetimes of dust particles (especially smaller ones) by driving their
orbital eccentricity to values so high that they impact the planet. In situ observations by Mars-
orbiting spacecraft of anomalies in the solar wind magnetic field were interpreted in the 1980s
as being due to Martian rings, but more extensive measurements by the magnetometer aboard
Mars Global Surveyor showed that observable fluctuations are likely due to well-known solar
wind or bow shock phenomena (Øieroset et al. 2010).
Looking for rings around a solid planet like Mars at low phase is more difficult than similar
observations at gas giant planets because of the former’s lack of atmospheric methane. Because
methane has verystrong absorption bands (e.g., at 2.2 μm), images ofgas giants taken at selected
wavelengths will see a greatly darkened planet, facilitating the detection of faint rings. On the
other hand, looking for Martian rings at high phase is less effective than for other dusty rings
because particles smaller than ∼50 μm are expected to be depleted due to radiation pressure
(Hamilton 1996; Showalter et al. 2006).
2.5.2 Pluto
Pluto, like Mars, could harbor a tenuous ring system of dust derived from its small moons Nix
and Hydra and P4 (Stern et al. 2006). Charon, as discussed in >Sect. 3.4, is paradoxically less
likely to be a major source of dusty rings because its gravitational field will more efficiently
retain any dust ejected from its surface. Observations to date (Steffl and Stern 2007) are not
sensitive enough even to rule out the conservatively estimated normal optical depth τ⊥< −
suggested by Stern et al. (2006), though more sensitive observations were very recently obtained
(Showalter et al. 2011a).
Further Earth-based observations may improve on this sensitivity, and a clearer picture of
Pluto’s rings (or lack thereof) should come from imaging during the planned New Horizons
flyby in 2015, especially during the post-encounter period when the phase angle will be high.
However, both of the handicaps discussed above for Mars, the lack of atmospheric methane and
the loss of smaller dust grains due to radiation pressure, are also likely to hamper the detection
of any Plutonian rings.
2.5.3 Rhea and Other Moons
Rhea, the largest of Saturn’s airless moons, is in the opposite situation from Mars and Pluto,
with no clear theoretical prediction but a claim that rings have been observed. Jones et al.
(2008) reported unusual electron-absorption signatures detected by the Magnetospheric Imag-
ing Instrument (MIMI) during Rhea flybys of the Cassini spacecraft and attributed these
signatures to rings. What would be the first known ring system around a moon includes several
narrow bands embedded within a broad diffuse cloud. The MIMI instrument detects changes
in the miasma of charged particles through which the spacecraft is constantly passing, enabling
inferences regarding solid and magnetospheric structures that shape the plasma environment.

326 7
Planetary Rings
A good analogy is the way a person driving in a blinding rain can perceive having driven under
a bridge by the sudden cessation of raindrops hitting the windshield.5
However, an extensive search for Rhea rings using Cassini ISS images (Tiscareno et al.
2010b) places severe limits on any possible Rhea rings. Using the calculations of Jones et al.
(2008), which assume that a particle’s ability to block electrons increases linearly with its mass
(and thus its volume), the ISS observations limit the narrow rings to a characteristic particle
size r > m, and μm-sized dust in any significant abundance is unequivocally excluded. This
minimum particle size is unrealistically large given that such large particles must constantly be
eroded to smaller sizes, which then would have been detected in the ISS images. Furthermore,
Tiscareno et al. (2010b) pointed out that the electron penetration depth for the low-energy
electrons used by Jones et al. (2008) is much smaller than the suggested particle sizes, so that
a particle’s ability to block electrons should increase linearly with its surface area rather than
its volume. Thus, Tiscareno et al. (2010b) recalculate the ring optical depth required to explain
the Jones et al. (2008) observations to be several orders of magnitude higher than the values
excluded by the ISS observations, both for the narrow rings and the broad cloud (>Fig. 7-10).
It seems most likely, therefore, that the signatures detected by the Cassini MIMI instrument are
due to some magnetospheric phenomenon, and not to rings of solid material around Rhea.
Following the MIMI announcement that Rhea might have rings, Schenk and McKinnon
(2009) reported a clumpy and discontinuous chain of discrete bluish splotches, up to 10 km
⊡Fig. 7-10
Comparison of the radius r and number density n of particles, the latter expressed in terms of
the extinction coeﬃcient πr2n of putative Rhea rings, inferred from charged-particle absorptions
observed by Cassini MIMI (Jones et al. 2008) and imaging non-detection by Cassini ISS (Tiscareno
et al. 2010b), shown in red and green, respectively. Dashed lines indicate requirements previously
claimed (Jones et al. 2008) for particle sizes larger than the electron penetration depth. For nar-
row rings (left), even allowing the latter claim, the combined observations require particles larger
than 10 m in radius, indicating an unrealistic lack of smaller particles. Furthermore, once allowance
is made for the role of the electron absorption length (horizontal lower boundary to red area),
the imaging non-detection rules out any form of absorption by solid material as the cause of
the observed charged-particle absorptions for both narrow rings and broad cloud (Figure from
Tiscareno et al. 2010b)

wide, aligned along more than half the circumference of a great circle inclined by ∼2○to Rhea’s
equator. Schenk et al. (2011), formally presenting that finding after publication of the ISS non-
detection, argued that the band may be a sign of a former Rhean ring, even if none exists
now. However, it remains unclear whether a ring system is even plausible at Rhea (whose
shape is triaxial rather than oblate), what would be the source of its material, whether a ten-
uous ring would assume the flatness (generally produced only in dense rings by collisional
evolution, while tenuous rings generally are vertically thick) implied by the observed nar-
row band, and whether the observed color variations are the likely result of such impacting
material.
Among other Saturnian moons, Mimas and Tethys also have equatorial color features
extending over ±○and ±○of latitude, respectively, much wider than Rhea’s and possibly the
result of magnetospheric bombardment (Schenk et al. 2011). Iapetus has a 13-km-high equato-
rial mountain range extending across >110○of longitude (Porco et al. 2005a; Giese et al. 2008).
Several endogenic hypotheses have been suggested for this structure, but Ip (2006) argued that
it was created by ring material falling out of Iapetan orbit, and Levison et al. (2011) further
developed the idea by proposing a giant impact to create the ring and sketching a scenario that
would simultaneously account for Iapetus’ surprisingly oblate shape. While Iapetus may be a
more hospitable site for rings than Rhea, given its oblate shape and large Hill sphere, it remains
unclear just how or whether orbiting material would be incorporated into a mountain range,
nor how such a ring would evolve and fall out.
2.5.4 Exoplanets
While hundreds of planets have now been detected in orbit about other stars using methods
including radial velocity, transits, astrometry, and direct imaging (Seager 2010), no exoplanet
yet has a confirmed ring system. The signature in a transit observation expected from an exo-
planet ring system was discussed by Barnes and Fortney (2004), and a few exoplanet detections
have been able to set meaningful upper limits on putative ring systems (e.g., Brown et al. 2001),
but it is too early to do statistics on the frequency of exoplanet rings, especially since the avail-
able observations with sufficient sensitivity are generally for “hot Jupiters” that orbit very close
to their stars. There are many factors stacked against the detection of rings around hot Jupiters
(Schlichting and Chang 2011), including small Hill spheres, low obliquities6 that would cause
rings to be seen edge-on (see also Ohta et al. 2009), loss of ring particles to Poynting-Robertson
drag and viscous drag from the planet’s exosphere (see also Gaudi et al. 2003), and equilib-
rium blackbody temperatures too high for even refractory materials to remain solid. However,
each of these factors is mitigated for planets ≳0.1 AU from their host stars (Schlichting and
Chang 2011). Furthermore, warping of the ring planes (Laplace planes) of “warm Saturns,” diag-
nostic of their planetary oblateness (see >Sect. 1.1) may be discernible in transit lightcurves
(Schlichting and Chang 2011).
The only known exoplanet for which a ring system has been specifically proposed is Foma-
lhaut b, which was the first7 exoplanet to be detected by direct imaging (Kalas et al. 2008).
The orbit of Fomalhaut b is ∼115 AU from its star and maintains the inner edge of an eccentric

7along with the three planets of the HR 8799 system, announced at the same time

debris belt that was known before the planet was (see > Sect. 6). The brightness of Fomal-
haut b in visible light, together with its dimness in the infrared, has led Kalas et al. (2008)
to suggest the planet has a large ring system, which would significantly increase its visible
brightness via reflection without affecting its emitted infrared radiation. However, a ring with a
surface brightness similar to that of Saturn’s A ring while extending to the planet’s Roche radius
would reflect far too little flux to account for the observations, so it is necessary to invoke a
disk extending to ∼35 planetary radii, approximately the distance from Jupiter to its outermost
large moon Callisto. Such a large disk would not be stable against accretion ( >Sect. 1.2) and
thus would perhaps be more of a dynamically evolving protosatellite disk than a stable ring
system.
A complex 2-month-long eclipse observed for the star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 may
have been due to a disk surrounding an otherwise-unknown planet, though it is also pos-
sible that the occulting disk instead adorns a low-mass stellar companion (Mamajek et al.
2012).

3.1 Dense Broad Disks
Saturn:
C ring
B ring
Cassini Division
A ring
Although the idea that Saturn’s main ring system is composed of “countless tiny ringlets”
continues to appear even in the professional literature, it is inaccurate. It is much better to say
that the main ring system is a nearly continuous disk with density that varies radially but only
a few true gaps that would separate one “ring” from another. Not only do waves travel radially
through the disk ( > Sect. 3.1.1), but material likely does as well through ballistic transport
(Durisen et al. 1989, 1992) and direct migration (Tiscareno et al. 2010c).
Although Saturn’s ring system, taken as a whole, is the only dense broad disk known to
us, its four main components are quite different from each other and thus still offer room for
comparative study. In addition to their wide differences in structure, the components vary in
location and density. The B ring is by far the most dense, with measured τ of 5 or more, followed
by the A ring at τ ∼., while the C ring and Cassini Division both have τ ∼.(>Fig. 7-11).
The B ring’s position astride the synchronous distance, at which the orbital period of particles
equals the rotation period of the planet (and thus of its magnetic field), is thought to influence
at least some of its properties (e.g., spokes), while the A ring’s outermost position causes it
to be more susceptible to accretion-related processes. The differences between the C ring and
the Cassini Division, despite their apparent similarities in optical depth and composition, may
also be primarily due to their different locations with respect to Saturn, its moons, and the
B ring.

3.1.1 Spiral Waves
Spiral density waves and spiral bending waves are the most widespread well-understood phe-
nomena in dense rings. First described for the case of galaxies by Lin and Shu (1964), and
applied to planetary rings by Goldreich and Tremaine (1978a, b, 1980), they can arise in any
disk subject to a periodic perturbation. In Saturn’s rings, the predominant mechanism is forc-
ing from a perturbing moon. At discrete locations in the disk, the orbits of individual particles
are resonant with the forcing and become excited. For a resonance with a moon, this happens
when the resonance argument φ, the quantity that libratesabout a constant value at the resonant
location, is of the form8
φ = (m + k)λ′ −(m −)λ −X −kX′,
(7.6)
where m and k are integers, primed quantities refer to the forcing moon, and X is some integer
combination of ϖ or Ω (see >Sect. 1.1 for orbital elements). For any given value9 of m and
k, and for any particular forcing moon, there is a unique location in the ring plane at which
the resonance occurs; this location can be found by differentiating ( > 7.6) and setting the
time-derivative ˙φ = , since n (= ˙λ), ˙ϖ, and ˙Ω are all known functions of radial location in
the ring plane (a), and the orbital frequencies of the moon are known. In fact, since n and n′
are much larger than the others, the approximate location of the resonance can be found from
them alone, and the resonance is generally labeled with the ratio (m+k):(m −). At a Lindblad
8For brevity, this discussion is limited to inner Lindblad resonances and inner vertical resonances, where the disk is inward of the forcing
moon. Nearly all known spiral waves in rings are of this kind, though Tiscareno et al. (2007) detected inwardly propagating spiral density
waves excited by outer Lindblad resonances with Pan.
9The azimuthal parameter m gives the number of spiral arms in the resonant wave pattern, while k + is the “order” of the resonance,
with first-order resonances generally being strongest, followed by second-order, etc.

resonance (LR), where the identity of X (though not necessarily X′) is ϖ, the eccentricity of
the ring particle is excited, and a spiral density wave (a compression wave) propagates radially
outward away from the resonant location. At a vertical resonance (VR), where the identity of
X is Ω, the inclination of the ring particle is excited, and a spiral bending wave (a transverse
wave) propagates radially inward10 away from the resonant location. For more details, see, e.g.,
Sect. 10.3 of Murray and Dermott (1999).
When the perturbation is not too strong, the radial variation in surface density Δσ(r) for a
spiral density wave has the form
Δσ(r) ≃Aξ cos(ξ/)e−(ξ/ξD)
,
(7.7)
where A is an amplitude, ξD is a damping constant, and the dimensionless radial distance from
resonance ξ is given by

)
/
⋅r −rL
rL
,
(7.8)
where rL and nL are the radius and mean motion at the location of exact resonance, σis the
unperturbed surface density, and G is Newton’s constant. This simplified equation is valid only
for the downstream portion of the wave, ξ ≳. We have also removed the phase term, which
causes the wave to have a spiral shape. For the linear theory in its full form, see Goldreich and
Tremaine (1982), Shu (1984), or Tiscareno et al. (2007).
Spiral waves, especially weak ones, are useful structures that can be thought of as in situ
scientific instruments placed in the rings. > Equation 7.7 describes a sinusoid with frequency
that increases linearly with distance from the resonance; the rate of increase is inversely propor-
tional to the background surface density σand thus can be used to measure it. The sinusoid
oscillates within an envelope whose amplitude begins by increasing linearly, but then turns over
and begins to decay as the exponential damping term takes over; the location of that turnover
is governed by the damping constant ξD, which can thus be obtained and used to constrain the
ring’s dynamic viscosity (Goldreich and Tremaine 1978b; Shu 1984). Additionally, the mass of
the perturbing moon can be obtained from the amplitude A, its orbital phase from the wave’s
phase term, and the absolute distance from Saturn’s center from the resonance location rL,
though these parameters are often already known too precisely for the density wave to make
a significant contribution. An algorithm for extracting these parameters from observed weak
density waves (>Fig. 7-12) was described by Tiscareno et al. (2007), making use of the spatially
localized frequency spectra provided by a wavelet transform (Daubechies 1992; Torrence and
Compo 1998).
A profile of surface densities and viscosities in the Cassini Division and A ring is shown
in >Fig. 7-13. The Cassini measurements (filled circles) have much less scatter than the Voy-
ager measurements (open circles) not only because of greater measurement sensitivity but also
because they rely on weaker waves that adhere more closely to the linear theory ( > 7.7) but
were not detectable in Voyager data. Nonlinear spiral density waves occur when the amplitude
of the density perturbation Δσ becomes comparable to the background density σ. In this case,
instead of the quasi-sinusoidal profile of the linear case (( >7.7), >Fig. 7-12), the oscillation fre-
quency no longer increases linearly with distance from the resonance, and additionally, the wave
10The exception is the nodal resonance, labeled −1:0, in which the mean motion of the ring particles is resonant with the forcing moon’s
nodal precession ˙Ω. This peculiar resonance has a negative pattern speed, and its bending wave propagates outward (Rosen and Lissauer
1988).

model parameters from a series of RSS occultation profiles of the Mimas 5:3 density wave, the

but with several differences in other characteristics. Because they are transverse waves, both
damping and nonlinearity arise less readily, which in principle makes them even more useful as
ring diagnostics. However, they are significantly less abundant than density waves, because they
can only be excited by perturbing moons on inclined orbits. Also, bending waves are harder to
observe because they do not directly affect the optical depth. Rather, because they appear as
corrugations in the ring plane, they are most readily seen when illuminated from a light source
nearly in the ring plane and oriented azimuthally so as to shine across waveforms rather than
along them, so that the waveforms can maximize the effect of changing the path length and
thus the observed τ, even while τ⊥remains nearly constant (see >Sect. 1.3). In practice, these
conditions are met by occultations with low elevation angle and in images taken near in time
to Saturn’s equinox (which occurs every ∼14.5 year). In Cassini images taken during the 2009
equinox, some of the strongest bending waves (whose peaks rise the highest out of the mean
ring plane) are seen to cast shadows.

3.1.2 Gap Edges and Moonlet Wakes
There are 14 named gaps within Saturn’s main rings: 4 in the C ring, 8 in the Cassini Division,
and 2 in the A ring (>Fig. 7-11). Both of the A ring’s gaps contain known moons that clear them
by exerting a torque on nearby ring material, and some gaps in the C ring coincide with known
Lindblad resonances, but the other gaps are unexplained. Furthermore, even the two gaps that
do contain known moons exhibit a surprising amount of unexpected behavior at their edges.
When a ring particle passes through conjunction with a nearby moon, the moon’s gravity
imparts an eccentricityas well as veryslightlypushing the particle’s semimajoraxis awayfrom its
own. On its now-eccentric orbit, the ring particle passes through periapse and apoapse once per
orbit; during the same time period, an inward (outward) particle moves forward (backward) by
a distance πΔa in the moon’s frame of reference (>Fig. 7-15). To derive this, consider Kepler’s
Third Law, which states that an object’s orbital rate n decreases with increasing semimajor axis
a, specifically na= constant. Differentiating this with respect to a, we find the equation for
keplerian shear,

At relative velocity v = aΔn, over one orbital period P = π/n the relative motion of a ring
particle with respect to a perturbing moon is vP = πaΔn/n. Substituting ( >7.9), this becomes
πΔa.
The characteristic wavelength πΔa is ubiquitous in the vicinity of a gap-moon. Not only
does the gap edge form waves with that wavelength, but streamlines with that wavelength pen-
etrate into the disk (> Fig. 7-15). Because of the increasing wavelength, the distance between
streamlines (which correlates with surface density) forms a pattern called “moonlet wakes”11
that rotates with the gap-moon. It should be emphasized that these structures are not properly
called “waves,” as they do not propagate or otherwise dynamically evolve; rather, they are kine-
matic phenomena caused by the gap-moon organizing the orbital properties of the material
around it into streamlines. However, some of Pan’s moonlet wakes do reach high enough densi-
ties that the mutual self-gravity of particles enhances the peaks (Porco et al. 2005b) in a manner
similar to nonlinear density waves ( >Sect. 3.1.1). Before Pan or any other gap-moon had been
discovered, the wavy edges of the Encke Gap were tracked by Cuzzi and Scargle (1985), and
the nearby moonlet wakes by Showalter et al. (1986). Interpretation of these observed features
in terms of the simple theory just described allowed these authors to constrain the position
of the moon causing them, which led Showalter (1991) to discover Pan in archival Voyager
images.
Sharp ring edges can also be maintained at the locations of Lindblad resonances
(see >Sect. 3.1.1). The nature of the perturbation is similar to that in the impulse approxima-
tion described above, except that now the resulting streamline wavelength is exactly /m times
the orbital circumference at that location, so that repeated conjunctions combine in a resonant
effect. In fact, it can be shown that the resonant streamline wavelength πa/m reduces to πΔa
in the case of large m (which is to say, small Δa/a).
For example, the outer edge of the B ring is coincident with the 2:1 LR with Mimas, and
the outer edge of the A ring with the 7:6 LR with the co-orbital moons Janus and Epimetheus.
Both edges generally exhibit the expected 2-lobed and 7-lobed (respectively) structure, though
there are significant deviations that have been attributed to the time-variable orbits of Janus and
Epimetheus for the A ring edge (Spitale and Porco 2009) and the excitation of normal modes
in the nearby disk for the B ring edge (Spitale and Porco 2010). Of the eight gaps in the Cassini
Division, those not containing ringlets all have circular outer edges, and those not associated
with known moon resonances all have freely precessing elliptical inner edges (Hedman et al.
2010a). The Keeler Gap in the A ring also follows this pattern, with a nearly circular outer edge
and a 32-lobed inner edge due to a resonance with Prometheus, though again the expected
pattern is superposed with other structure that may be due to additional free or forced modes
(Tiscareno et al. 2005; Torrey et al. 2008).
Some edges also exhibit vertical structure. The moon Daphnis, at the center of the Keeler
Gap, has an inclined orbit that ventures ∼9 km above and below the ring plane (Jacobson et al.
2008). The resulting vertical corrugations of nearby portions of the gap edge were predicted and
then seen by their shadows cast during the 2009 equinox (Weiss et al. 2009). A region of vertical
structure, probably due to embedded moonlets on inclined orbits, has also been detected and
tracked in the outer edge of the B ring (Spitale and Porco 2010).
11Moonlet wakes have little in common with self-gravity wakes ( >Sect. 3.1.4), despite an unfortunate similarity in terminology.

3.1.3 Radial Structure
Several varieties of azimuthally symmetric radial structure are found in Saturn’s rings. In addi-
tion to the gaps discussed above, the two largest in size are a series of sharp-edged annuli in the
outer C ring with optical depths several times higher than the surrounding background, which
have been dubbed “plateaux,” and an undulating variation in optical depth in the inner B ring.
Both of these have radial scales of ∼100 km and have remained entirely unchanged during the
25 years between Voyager and Cassini observations (Nicholson et al. 2008), as well as remaining
unexplained.
Regions of short-wavelength axisymmetric waves have been found by occultations in the
inner A ring and in the B ring (Thomson et al. 2007; Colwell et al. 2007). The wavelengths
range from 0.15 to 0.22 km and are locally monochromatic – the waveforms interacted with
the spectrally coherent Cassini RSS radio occultation signal as if they were a diffraction grat-
ing (Thomson et al. 2007). This structure (>Fig. 7-16) has been explained in terms of viscous
overstability, which occurs when a perturbation triggers an overly strong restoring force that
resulting in continuing oscillations (for details and references, see Schmidt et al. 2009). Viscous
overstability can occur when the ring’s viscosity increases steeply with density, as naturally
occurs in dense rings due to increasingly frequent collisions, and is sensitively affected by the
strength of mutual self-gravity, the distribution of particle sizes, and the existence of self-gravity
wakes. Work is ongoing to characterize the appearance of overstability waves in Cassini data, as
well as their behavior in response to various environmental factors in simulations.

tions are coherent diﬀracted signal from the periodic microstructure acting as a diﬀraction grating

337
Both the Aand Brings have sharpdrops in optical depth at inneredges, with a “ramp” region
of gradually decreasing optical depth (with decreasing distance) inward of them. These ramps
have generally been considered to be the outermost portions of the Cassini Division and the
C ring, respectively (see >Fig. 7-11). The similarities in morphology, for the inner boundaries
of the only two truly dense (τ ≳.) broad disk structures known, are striking. The morphology
of the ramp structure as well as the sharp edge at its outward boundary (which, in both known
cases, is not correlated with any known resonance strong enough to explain it), as well as the
apparent compositional similarity between the ramp material and the denser ring on the other
side of the edge, has been explained in terms of ballistic transport, the radial movement of
material due to micrometeoroid bombardment (Durisen et al. 1989, 1992). However, doubt is
cast on that hypothesis by recent measurements of the wavelength dispersion of a spiral wave
( >Sect. 3.1.1) stretching across the sharp edge in optical depth between the Cassini Division
ramp and the A ring, which indicates that there may not be a corresponding sharp change in
surface density at that location (Tiscareno et al. 2009a).
3.1.4 Self-Gravity Wakes
The boundary between disruption-dominated regions (in which disks are stable) and accretion-
dominatedregions (see >Sect. 1.2) is not a sharp one. In the outer parts of the region of stability
for disks, gravitational instabilities drive temporary accretion that is quickly disrupted again
by tides, forming a disk microstructure known as self-gravity wakes (SGWs). This balance is
characterized by Toomre’s Q parameter (for details and references, see Schmidt et al. 2009),
defined as
Q =
crκ
.Gσ ,
(7.10)
where cr is the radial velocity dispersion, σ is the local surface density, and κ ≡n −˙ϖ ≈n
(see >Sect. 1.1). Gravitational instability (i.e., accretion) is generally avoided as long as Q is
at least a few times unity, but can become prominent if random velocities are damped (lower
cr) and/or surface density σ is increased and/or at locations further from the planet (lower κ).
Balance between accretion and disruption, leading to SGWs, occurs when Q ∼. Data from
the damping of spiral density waves ( >Sect. 3.1.1) indicate that cr and σ adjust themselves in
order to maintain Q ∼over a wide region of the A ring (Tiscareno et al. 2007).
SGWs generally have a webbed structure that is elongated in a characteristic direction
(> Fig. 7-17), usually a few degrees to a few tens of degrees from azimuthal. Perpendicular
to the characteristic direction, there is a characteristic spacing given by the Toomre critical
wavelength,
λcr = πGσ
κ
.
(7.11)
Because of their non-axisymmetric structure and their finite vertical thickness, the brightness
of a disk pervaded by SGWs depends on the observer’s longitude. An observer looking along
the direction of the elongated wake structures will see more of the gaps between the wakes than
an observer looking across the wakes (>Fig. 7-18), especially at low elevation angles. Colombo
et al. (1976) were the first to suggest the presence of SGWs in Saturn’s rings as an explana-
tion for the observed azimuthal brightness asymmetry. Today, observations of ring photometry
combined with simulations of SGWs are further refining understanding of ring properties
(see > Sects. 4.1 and >4.2).

Simulated self-gravity wakes (SGWs). This microstructure develops within dense rings as particles
clump together under their mutual self-gravity but are ripped apart again by Saturn’s tides (Figure

Repeated stellar occultations with varying geometries are another way to gather informa-
tion about SGW structure. Such observations from Cassini UVIS (Colwell et al. 2006, 2007)
and Cassini VIMS (Hedman et al. 2007a; Nicholson and Hedman 2010) have been interpreted
in terms of simple models with a bimodal distribution of optical depths, treating the SGWs as
nearly opaque with optical depth τwake, and the intervening space as characterized by a constant
lower optical depth τgap. Both teams have produced resulting data sets of various wake param-
eters as a function of radial location in the disk (>Fig. 7-19). However, Tiscareno et al. (2010a)
investigated the density contrast and the distribution of densities in simulated SGWs and found
instead a trimodal distribution (>Fig. 7-20). In their histograms (>Fig. 7-20), the high-τ peak
corresponds to the τwake assumed in simpler models, while the low-τ peak is practically trans-
parent by contrast. In such a regime, the photometry of SGWs (especially for occultations and
for images of the unlit side of the rings) is largely dominated by the mid-τ peak, which simulated
movies identify as former wakes in the process of disruption. The areal average of the mid-τ and
low-τ regions can be identified with the τgap values inferred from simpler models, except in the
case of very low elevation angle (Tiscareno et al. 2010a), thus preserving the usefulness of the
previous UVIS and VIMS studies. Recent preliminary results from a very-high-resolution UVIS
occultation appear to give empirical confirmation that the distribution of surface densities in
SGW-dominated disk regions is trimodal (Sremˇcevi´c et al. 2009).
SGWs may have a dramatic effect on the relationship between ring optical depth and surface
density. Simulations by Robbins et al. (2010) found that increased surface density merely added

They estimated that the mass of the B ring may be higher than Voyager-era estimates by a factor
of 10 or more, approaching twice the mass of Mimas. See >Sect. 5 for a discussion of the impact
of this finding on the age and origin of Saturn’s rings.
3.1.5 Propellers
A disk-embedded moon that is too small to open a full circumferential gap may still create a
local disturbance in the disk. Because of Kepler’s Third Law, the radially inward portion of the
disturbance is carried forward and leads the moon, while the radially outward portion trails
the moonlet (> Figs. 7-21 and >7-22). Due to this characteristic shape, such moonlet-caused

in addition to changes in spectral absorption by water ice and in the abundance of propellers

disturbances have been named “propellers.” A propeller-shaped disturbance can be thought
of as a moon’s unsuccessful attempt to form a full circumferential gap, which is frustrated by
local ring viscous processes that limit the gap’s azimuthal extent. Following predictions based
on theory and modeling (Spahn and Sremˇcevi´c 2000; Sremˇcevi´c et al. 2002; Seiß et al. 2005),
propellers in a range of sizes have been observed in Cassini images (Tiscareno et al. 2006a);

disturbance is directly seen, while the responsible moon at the center is inferred.
The occurrence of observed propellers is confined to only a few annular regions within
the A ring. The three “Propeller Belts” in the mid-A ring are located between 127,000 and
132,000 km from Saturn’s center (> Fig. 7-23) and are separated by propeller-poor “halo”
regions, centered on large density waves, in which other ring properties are also altered
(> Fig. 7-19). It is not known whether the radial variations in observed abundance of
propellers are due to variations in their origins, survival, observability, or a combination of
the three.
The Propeller Belts contain numerous small propellers with the radial offset parameter
Δr (> Fig. 7-22) ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 km and azimuthal extent of up to several kilometers

(Tiscareno et al. 2008). A separate class of “giant propellers” has been found in the outermost
A ring, outward of the Encke Gap (133,700 km from Saturn’s center) and thus called the “trans-
Encke” population, with measured Δr as high as 6 km and azimuthal extent of up to several
thousand kilometers (Tiscareno et al. 2010c).
Simulated propeller structures have both density-depleted and density-enhanced regions
(>Fig. 7-21), and the interpretation of observed propellers in terms of relative density has been
a point of controversy. In simulated propellers, the radial offset Δr is consistently close to four
times the central moon’s Hill radius ( >7.2) and thus is diagnostic of its mass.The first observed
propellers, which were seen during Cassini’s Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) maneuver and are
thus the smallest known but also the best resolved in the Propeller Belts, are relative-bright
with respect to nearby unperturbed regions of the A ring (Tiscareno et al. 2006a). Although
this photometry is consistent with a region of enhanced optical depth, the morphology of the
SOI propellers is very similar to that of density-depleted regions in propeller simulations. The
photometry of larger propellers in the Propeller Belts also turned out to be generally consis-
tent with enhanced optical depth (Sremˇcevi´c et al. 2007; Tiscareno et al. 2008). Hypotheses to
explain the apparent correlation between high optical depth and depleted density include the
temporary liberation of ring-particle regolith within the propeller structure (Sremˇcevi´c et al.
2007; Halme et al. 2010) and the disruption of self-gravity wakes within the propeller structure
(Tiscareno et al. 2010a). In giant propellers, for the first time, relative-dark and relative-bright
regions are sometimes seen in the same propeller structure (> Fig. 7-22), enabling density-
enhanced and density-depleted regions to be disentangled in some cases (Tiscareno et al.
2010c). However, the structure of giant propellers may be qualitatively different than that of
the smaller propellers in the Propeller Belts, so parallels should be drawn cautiously.
The giant trans-Encke propellers are larger and more prominent than those in the Propeller
Belts, and also much less numerous. Taken together, these factors allow giant propellers to be
studied individually and tracked over a period of years. In the Propeller Belts, the swarm of
particles is such that, even if the same object were seen on multiple occasions, it would be very
difficult to have much certainty that it was the same object due to the many nearby similar
objects. This criterion maybe useful fordrawing a distinction, should one wish todoso, between
a “moon” and a “moonlet.” Basing such a distinction upon size is arbitrary and lacks any wide
agreement, as there is no major physical threshold crossed by objects in the km-size range. We
suggest that any object be called a “moon” if it can be singled out for long-term study, while a
“moonlet” is a member of a population or swarm that prevents individual tracking. This may
still not be a bright line, but at least it is based on a physical property. The question of whether
propeller-causing objects deserve to be considered as full-fledged moons is further complicated
by the fact that, though their positions have been tracked over long periods, they are not directly
seen but hidden within the surrounding propeller-shaped disturbance.
The propeller population follows a very steep particle-size distribution, with a power-law
index q ∼(Tiscareno et al. 2008, 2010c) for propeller moonlets of size between 30 and 300 m.
By contrast, the vast majority of ring mass is concentrated in the continuum particles of size
between 1 cm and 10 m, with a much shallower power-law index q ∼.(Zebker et al. 1985;
Cuzzi et al. 2009).
Spitale and Porco (2010) reported a single observation of what appears to be an embedded
moon of radius 0.3 km in the outermost parts of the B ring, based on the shadow it cast onto
the (vertically much thinner) ring while the 2009 equinox brought nearly edge-on ring illumi-
nation (> Fig. 7-24). However, though this object’s size is comparable to that inferred for the
largest propeller moons, no propeller structure is apparent around this object. Michikoshi and

The feature known as S/2009 S 1, identiﬁed by the shadow it cast during equinox, was seen only in
this image (Figure from Spitale and Porco 2010)
Kokubo (2011) investigated the possibility that the B ring’s high surface density, with accom-
panyingly strong self-gravity wakes, might prevent the formation of a propeller structure. They
found that propellers form when the moonlet’s Hill radius rHill ( >7.2) is larger than the Toomre
critical wavelength λcr ( > 7.11). While this condition might hold if a moon of the observed
size were in the densest parts of the central B ring, the surface densities inferred by Spitale and
Porco (2010) for the outer B ring are not high enough. Possible explanations include that the
surface densities in the outer B ring are higher than thought, that the observed object is not a
moonlet but perhaps an impact cloud or a large SGW clump, that the observed bright feature
does indeed include an unresolved propeller structure, or that propellers require a (not well
understood) photometric balance in order to be observed, and that balance is not met in the
outer B ring.
Orbital tracking of trans-Encke propellers has revealed a surprising non-keplerian compo-
nent to their motion (Tiscareno et al. 2010c). The best-observed example had its semimajoraxis
increase (as detected by tracking its longitude as a function of time, not its actual radial position)
by a rate as high as +.km year−between 2006 and 2007, then decrease by −.km year−
from 2007 to 2009 (> Fig. 7-25). Although this profile is similar to a sinusoid, no resonance
with a known moon has been found to be capable of producing such behavior. Another mecha-
nism that would produce a sinusoidal residual is the so-called frog resonance (Pan and Chiang
2010), in which the propeller moonlet interacts primarily with the mass at either end of the pro-
peller gap. The propeller moonlet plausibly librates with the observed amplitude and period in
a simple version of the model, but it remains unclear whether the moon-formed gap responds
sluggishly enough to allow the moon to librate within it.
Other hypotheses for non-keplerian motion of propellers are based on the concept of
“Type I migration.” As classically formulated for protoplanetary disks (Ward 1986, 1997;
Papaloizou et al. 2007), the angular momentum exchange at inner Lindblad resonances between
a disk and an embedded mass fails to exactly cancel with that at outer Lindblad resonances,

resulting in a differential torque that leads to inward migration of the embedded mass.
However, classical Type I migration depends crucially on the gas component of the disk, which
causes Lindblad resonance locations to shift asymmetrically. For the case of planetary rings,
which are strictly particulate, Crida et al. (2010) rederived the equations for Type I migration
from first principles, using analytical arguments and numerical simulations to trace the angu-
lar momentum exchange between streamlines of continuum ring particles and the embedded
moon. For the case of a homogeneous disk, Crida et al. (2010) found an asymmetric torque that
is always inward and is one to two orders of magnitude too weak to explain the observed non-
keplerian motion. Building upon this work, Rein and Papaloizou (2010) considered temporal
variations in the disk, proposing that the propeller moon is constantly perturbed by stochastic
variations in the disk’s surface density due to self-gravity wakes, finding that a random walk in
the propeller moon’s semimajor axis can result. On the other hand, Tiscareno (2012) consid-
ered spatial variations in the disk, proposing that an externally produced radial surface density
profile results in an equilibrium semimajor axis to which the propeller moon will return after
episodic kicks.
Continued observations should distinguish among these models. The leading models inter-
pret the existing data as a sinusoid (Pan and Chiang 2010), episodically initiated exponentials
(Tiscareno 2012), and a pure random walk (Rein and Papaloizou 2010), and thus they differ-
ently predict the qualitative nature of future data. However, all of the leading models imply that
propeller moons, which are the first objects ever discovered to orbit while embedded in a disk
rather than in free space, are directly interacting with the disk, a phenomenon that has long
been an integral part of disk models but has never before been directly observed.
3.1.6 Spokes and Impacts
“Spokes” are near-radial markings on Saturn’s B ring, likely composed of dust levitating above
the ring plane due to electromagnetic forces (for details and references, see Horányi et al. 2009).
Spokes usually form on the dawn side of the rings where ring particles are just coming into
full sunlight, and have a correlation with periodicities believed to originate with Saturn’s mag-
netic field. Susceptibility to electromagnetic forces surely is connected to the fact that spokes
appear at radial locations near to (and often astride) that of synchronous orbit, where the orbital
period of a ring particle matches the rotation period of the planet, and thus also of the mag-
netic field. Spokes appear to be a seasonal phenomenon, correlated with a low elevation angle
of the Sun above the ring plane, probably due to variations in the generation of plasma by pho-
tocharging near the rings. The Hubble Space Telescope tracked the decline and disappearance
of spokes during “Saturnian October/November” in the late 1990s (McGhee et al. 2005), and
they remained absent during the first 1.5 year of Cassini operations at Saturn before reappear-
ing in “Saturnian January/February” in late 2005 (Mitchell et al. 2006). Since their reappearance,
Cassini images have tracked the morphology, photometry, evolution, and temporal variability
of spokes (Mitchell et al. 2012).
Numerous theories for the formation of spokes have been put forward, but none has gained
definitive acceptance. The most popular mechanism is that of Goertz and Morfill (1983), who
interpret spokes as dust levitated above the ring plane by an electromagnetic disturbance initi-
ated by a micrometeoroid impact. Following the inference of Smith et al. (1982) from Voyager 2
images that spokes with a radial dimension of thousands of kilometers form on a timescale
of several minutes, the Goertz and Morfill (1983) model includes a propagation speed for

Planetary Rings 7

the plasma cloud ≳20 km s−, though this result was criticized by Farmer and Goldreich (2005;
see reply by Morfill and Thomas 2005). Other ideas for the rapid appearance of spokes include
near-simultaneous impact of a broad assemblage of particles generated elsewhere; the most
developed model of this type suggests an electron beam generated by Saturnian lightning (Hill
and Mendis 1981; Jones et al. 2006), though a dispersed cloud originating from an impact
has also been suggested (Hamilton 2006). On the other hand, despite executing a number of
high-frequency imaging sequences designed to do so, Cassini has not observed the rapid forma-
tion of spokes but did observe spokes growing from negligible to strong over ∼hour timescales
(Mitchell et al. 2012).
During the 2009 Saturnian equinox, dust clouds evolving under keplerian shear were
observed in the A and C rings and attributed to micrometeoroid impacts Tiscareno et al. (2009b;
see also >Sect. 3.6). Ongoing analysis of these impact clouds may lead to new constraints on the
interplanetary micrometeoroid population, as well as better understanding of the relationship
between impacts and spokes.
3.2 Dense Narrow Rings

Titan ringlet
Maxwell ringlet
Bond ringlet (“1.470 RS”)
Huygens ringlet
“Strange”ringlet
Herschel ringlet (“1.960 RS”)

Uranus:

Dense narrow rings are a unique assemblage ofmatter, behaving as a coherent self-contained
object on planetary lengthscales yet ephemerally thin (1–100 km in radial width, compared to
∼100,000 km in diameter) and not in a gravitational ground state (unlike a planet, one would
collapse if it stopped moving). The formation and proximate causes of these highly organized
dynamical systems are almost entirely unknown, and even their present dynamics are only
partly understood. For Uranian narrow ringlets, which constitute the majority of the known
examples, their highly time-variable properties were only dimly revealed by the single snapshot
provided by the Voyager 2 flyby, with temporal resolution provided by Earth-based occulta-
tions, while analysis of the more extensive Cassini data set of Saturnian narrow ringlets is still
in progress.

348 7
Planetary Rings
Nearly all known dense narrow rings are either noncircular or inclined to the main ring
plane, or both. Their radial widths range from ∼1 km (many examples) up to ∼100 km for the
Maxwell ringlet and the є ring. Furthermore, nearly all dense narrow rings have edges that
are quite sharp; as with dense disks, the existence and stability of such sharp edges requires
some confinement mechanism to counteract the natural process of radial viscous spreading.
Confinement may be due to an external moon or to the ring’s own self-gravity, and in some
cases to processes yet to be understood. A detailed table of ringlets and their properties was
given by Colwell et al. (2009b) for Saturn’s rings and by French et al. (1991) for Uranus’. For
general details and references on the dynamics of narrow rings, see French et al. (1991) and
Schmidt et al. (2009).
The “shepherding” mechanism by which a moon opens a gap or maintains an edge in a disk
( > Sect. 3.1.2) can also occur with two shepherd moons on either side of a narrow ringlet
(Goldreich and Tremaine 1979a). As previously discussed, this can occur through repeated
impulses on nearby material or more distantly through a resonance. The only example of a
dense narrow ring with a known shepherd on either side is Uranus’ є ring, though Saturn’s
F ring (see >Sect. 3.3) is a variation on that idea. The Titan ringlet in Saturn’s C ring is at the
location of an apsidal resonance with Titan, where the ring particle’s precession frequency ˙ϖ is
commensurate with Titan’s orbital motion, so that the eccentric ringlet always keeps its apoapse
pointed toward Titan. The Bond ringlet in Saturn’s outer C ring is associated with a 3:1 Lind-
blad resonance with Mimas, and a few edges of Uranian rings coincide with resonances, but the
details of the interaction are yet to be understood in all cases.
Any ringlet of finite width ought to have a different precession rate ˙ϖ at its inner and outer
edges, which should smear out the orientation of ring particle orbits and prevent the ringlet
from appearing eccentric. However, this effect can be counteracted by the ring’s own gravity
(Goldreich and Tremaine 1979b, 1981; Borderies et al. 1983), possibly combined with viscous
and collisional effects (Dermott and Murray 1980; Chiang and Goldreich 2000; Mosqueira
and Estrada 2002). A purely gravitational model requires a positive “eccentricity gradient,”
which is to say that the eccentricity monotonically increases from the ring’s inner edge to its
outer edge.
A number of ringlets indeed appear to precess about their planet as a rigid body. Obser-
vations of some of these, such as the Maxwell ringlet and the α and β rings, are consistent
with a pure freely precessing ellipse (i.e., an m = mode) as described by theory, and the
Maxwell ringlet even has a clearly positive eccentricity gradient (Spitale and Porco 2006), while
other ringlets appear to have additional components to their motion. The Huygens ringlet
appears to have an additional m = mode, possibly influenced by the Mimas 2:1 resonance
that governs the nearby outer edge of the B ring, as well as an m = mode of unknown origin
(Spitale and Porco 2006). The δ ring also has an m = mode, while the γ ring has an m = 
mode, which is to say a radial oscillation (French et al. 1991). Higher-m modes, some corre-
sponding to known moons, have also been found in several Uranian rings by Showalter (2011),
who also pointed out that non-detections of shepherd moons at Uranus have become significant
enough that shepherding is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of ring confinement.
Spiral density waves ( > Sect. 3.1.1) can also occur in dense narrow rings, at least those
broad enough (generally a few kilometers) for a wave to develop, but not many examples have
been identified. A density wave due to the Pandora 9:7 LR appears to propagate through the
Laplace ringlet (Colwell et al. 2009b). A possible density wave was detected in the Voyagerstellar
occultation of Uranus’ δ ring, but it cannot be confirmed in the absence of data at multiple
longitudes and/or times, and furthermore, there is no known moon at the proper place to raise
such a wave.

In Saturn’s rings, gaps are named by the IAU but ringlets are not. In most cases, the main
ringlet within a particular gap is given the same name as its gap (though many favor the name
“Titan ringlet” for the ringlet in the Colombo Gap, for its strong association with a resonance
with Titan), but the existence of multiple ringlets in one gap requires some naming creativity.
For example, the Huygens Gap contains a second dense narrow ringlet outward of the main
Huygens ringlet, which has been informally nicknamed the “Strange” ringlet in part because of
its unusually high inclination (Spitale et al. 2008) and in part as a complement to the “Charm-
ing” ringlet ( >Sect. 3.3). Five ringlets with noncircular features were identified in Voyager-era
publications (e.g., French et al. 1993) only by their distance from Saturn’s center in units of Sat-
urn radii; of these, three can now be easily named for the gap containing them as shown in
the accompanying table. However, the former “1.495 RS ringlet” is classified by Colwell et al.
(2009b) as a plateau or embedded ringlet because it is adjacent to the continuum C ring rather
than fully contained in the Dawes Gap, while the former “1.994 RS ringlet” is now considered
part of the continuum Cassini Division between two narrow gaps, rather than a ringlet that
nearly fills its gap, judging from the characteristic pattern of empty gaps having circular outer
edges and resonant inner edges (Hedman et al. 2010a, see also >Sect. 3.1.2).
3.3 Narrow Dusty Rings
Saturn:
“Charming”ringlet
Encke ringlets
F ring
Uranus:
λ ring
Neptune:
Le Verrier ring
Arago ring
Adams ring
The smallest particles in dense rings are usually swept up by larger ones and incorporated
into their regolith (Cuzzi et al. 2009), and so such rings are largely dust free, which is to say
that they have few particles smaller than mm- to cm-size and thus are not strongly forward-
scattering in their interactions with light. Therefore, the dustiness of a few structures that do
occur within Saturn’s and Uranus’ main rings is a likely indicator of relative dynamism and/or
youthfulness that either prevents dust from being swept up or has not allowed time for it to be
swept up yet. In Neptune’s rings, on the other hand, the lack of any ring component with optical
depth exceeding 0.1 may account for the general dustiness of the system.
In Saturn’s main rings, high dust fractions are found exclusively in a small number of nar-
row dusty ringlets that occur in the larger empty gaps (Horányi et al. 2009). The only gap with
multiple dusty ringlets is the Encke Gap, which three ringlets share with the moon Pan. These
are riddled with “clumps” (azimuthal brightness variations) and “kinks” (radial offsets) that
drift slowly with respect to each other (Hedman et al. 2005, 2011b; Horányi et al. 2009). The
Encke ringlets and the “Charming” ringlet within the Laplace Gapare known tobe “heliotropic,”
which is to say that they have an eccentricity forced by solar radiation pressure that causes
their apoapses to always point toward the Sun (Hedman et al. 2007b, 2010b). The “Charming”
ringlet is smooth, lacking clumps or kinks; the best studied of the heliotropic rings, it also has
free eccentricity and free inclination components in addition to its solar-forced eccentricity
(Hedman et al. 2010b).

Planetary Rings
The F ring is the granddaddy of narrow dusty ringlets, being by far the best studied as well as
the largest. For a review and references, see Colwell et al. (2009b). Located a few thousand kilo-
meters off the outer edge of Saturn’s main rings, and with both significant vertical thickness and
inclination (≳10 km in both cases), the F ring effectively frustrates any attempt to see the rest
of the main rings in edge-on viewing geometries. Its high fraction of forward-scattering dust
makes it by far the brightest component of Saturn’s ring system when viewed at high-phase
geometries.
The core of the F ring contains a large amount of dust enveloping an unseen belt of km-size
moonlets, inferred from their absorption of charged particles (Cuzzi and Burns 1988), from the
characteristic “fan” structures they create in surrounding dust (Murray et al. 2008; Beurle et al.
2010), from direct detection by occultations (Esposito et al. 2008; Hedman et al. 2011c), and
from shadows cast during the 2009 Saturnian equinox (Beurle et al. 2010). Several dusty lanes
or “strands” accompany the core on either side, nearly parallel to it though Charnoz et al. (2005)
pointed out that the most prominent strands can be laid end-to-end to form a one-armed kine-
matic spiral. Nascent strands, or “jets,” have been associated with collisions between moonlets
and the core (Murray et al. 2008). Despite being entirely composed of “clumps” and “kinks” so
numerous that they cannot be individually tracked as they are in the Encke ringlets, the F ring
core nevertheless maintains over decadal timescales the shape of a freely precessing eccentric
inclined ellipse; the orbital solution formulated to account for Voyager and other pre-Cassini
data (Bosh et al. 2002) has, somewhatsurprisingly, remained a good predictor of the core’s posi-
tion through the Cassini mission (Murray et al. 2008; Albers et al. 2012). However, decade-scale
time variations in the core’s internal structure, as well as in the surrounding dust, have clearly
taken place between the Voyager and Cassini visits (Colwell et al. 2009b; Showalter et al. 2009).
The F ring is one of only two narrow rings (along with the є ring) to have known “shep-
herd” moons orbiting on either side of it. However, it has not been conclusively shown how (or
even that) the moons Prometheus and Pandora actually constrain the F ring in its place, and
in fact, they appear to stir the ring up at least as much as to maintain it. Simulations by Winter
et al. (2007) found the moons to be responsible for both strong chaos and significant radial
confinement. Both moons create at each closest approach a “streamer-channel” in nearby dust
strands that subsequently moves downstream and shears under keplerian motion (>Fig. 7-26,
Murray et al. 2005). During the 2009 Saturnian equinox, which coincided with the once-in-17-
year alignment12 of Prometheus’ apoapse with the F ring’s periapse, minimizing their mutual
closest approach distance (Chavez 2009), moonlets inferred from their shadows had a clear
correlation of abundance with longitude relative to Prometheus (Beurle et al. 2010), indicating
that Prometheus is directly triggering accretion within the F ring, the products of which may
then be what collides with the core to form new jets and strands (Beurle et al. 2010). All of these
interwoven phenomenamake the F ring the solar system’sforemost natural laboratory for direct
observation of accretion and disruption processes.
Like the F ring, the λ ring is by far the brightest component of its planetary ring system
when viewed at high phase angles, due to its high fraction of forward-scattering dust. But the
λ ring appears to be significantly simpler and more sedate than its Saturnian cousin, and its low
detectability at lower phase and in occultations indicates that it is poor in macroscopic particles.
Among dense ring systems, Neptune’s has a much higher dust fraction than those of Saturn
and Uranus and is unique in having no significant dust-free regions. The three main rings of
Neptune lack sharp edges and are generally more tenuous, with only the Adams ring reaching

optical depths even as high as 0.1, and are consequently less well observed. The only post-
Voyager observations, other than of the Adams ring and its arcs (see >Sect. 3.5), are a marginal
detection of the Le Verrier ring reported by Sicardy et al. (1999), which if confirmed would
require it to be brighter than expected from Voyager data, and a clear detection by de Pater et al.
(2005) that found the Le Verrier ring’s brightness to be consistent with Voyager measurements.
Possible explanations include temporal brightening in the Le Verrier ring followed by a return
to its previous state, or unexpected spectral properties, or (a possibility they admit) that the
Sicardy et al. (1999) detection was affected by image artifacts.

Planetary Rings
Every known ring system has a diffuse component that is optically thin and composed
of μm-size dust particles. The dynamics and evolution of diffuse dusty rings are made more
complex by the importance of forces other than gravity (Burns et al. 1979). Dust particles
are commonly low enough in mass that static electrical charging makes them susceptible to
electromagnetic forces comparable to gravity. They also have high ratios of surface area to
volume, which makes them susceptible to pressure from solar radiation, including Poynting-
Robertson drag. The evolution induced by these additional forces shortens the lifetimes of dust
particles so that the stability of diffuse dusty rings is only of a dynamical variety. The ring con-
sists of particles that originated from a source and are on their way to a sink; it may indeed
look the same at a different time, if the sources and sinks have not significantly changed, but
the particles comprising it will be different.
A comprehensive review of dusty ring systems was published by Burns et al. (2001).
The primary mechanism for producing orbiting dust particles is micrometeoroid bombard-
ment of larger orbiting bodies. The rate at which a moon of radius R supplies mass to a dusty
ring is given by (Burns et al. 1999)
dM
dt ∼ΦYFeR,
(7.12)
where Φ is the impactor flux, Y is the yield of ejected mass as a fraction of projectile mass,
and Fe is the fraction of ejected mass that achieves planetary orbit. The yield Y depends on the
material properties of the moon’s regolith, while the fraction Fe of ejecta that can escape the
moon’s gravity depends on the moon’s escape velocity and the distribution of ejecta velocities.
Empirically, the fraction of ejecta with velocity higher than v goes as (vcrit/v)/, where vcrit
is the minimum speed at which material is ejected, between 10 and 100 m s−where lower val-
ues are for softer moon’s regoliths (Burns et al. 1984, 1999). The escape velocity of a spherical
moon with bulk density ρ goes as vesc ∝ρ/R and also ranges between 10 and 100 m s−. So
for vesc < vcrit, we have Fe = and dM/dt ∝R, but when vesc > vcrit, we have Fe ∝R−/and
dM/dt ∝R−/. That is, there turns out to be an optimal moon radius Rcrit ∼km for supply-
ing dust to a ringlet, with smaller moons intercepting fewer impactors and thus producing less
dust, while larger moons allow a smaller fraction of the produced dust to escape (>Fig. 7-27).
However, these trends are only for general estimation. A more detailed treatment must consider
the mechanics of ejecta production, including not only surface mechanics but also the changes
in the ejecta velocity profile with increasing R as impact formation moves from the strength
regime to the gravity regime (e.g., Richardson et al. 2007). Also, larger moons are more efficient
at sweeping up escaped particles during subsequent encounters (Agarwal et al. 2008; Kempf
et al. 2010).
All four known planetary ring systems appear to have an optically thin dusty ring as their
innermost component – Jupiter’s Halo ring, Saturn’s D ring, Uranus’ ζ ring, and Neptune’s
Galle ring. Dust rings often extend inward of their sources because Poynting-Robertson drag
in particular enforces an inward evolution of dust particles, as does resonant charge variation
inward of synchronous orbit (Burns et al. 2004). Both Jupiter’s Halo/Main ring and Saturn’s
D ring have likely source material at their outer edges (namely, Metis and Adrastea, and the
C ring, respectively), although at least the D ring has internal radial structure (Hedman et al.
2007c) that may also require embedded sources (i.e., undiscovered moons). The sources of
the poorly observed ζ ring and Galle ring are not known and may also include embedded
moons very close to the planet. Some of these dust sheets may extend all the way down
to the planet’s cloud tops, although Saturn’s D ring appears to have a clear gap of 5,000 km

Planetary Rings 7
353
⊡Fig. 7-27
Supply rate to a dusty ring via impact ejecta (dM/dt) is plotted in black, as a function of source
moon radius R. This quantity is the product ( > 7.12) of the total ejecta produced (ΦYR2, plotted
in blue in arbitrary units) and the fraction of ejecta that escapes the moon’s gravity and achieves
planetary orbit (Fe, plotted in red). Moons smaller than Rcrit lose all of their ejecta, while larger
moons produce more ejecta but allow a smaller fraction of it to escape. The optimal moon radius
for supplying dust to a ringlet varies with surface properties but is Rcrit ∼10 km for icy moons with
soft regolith (Burns et al. 1999)
between its inner boundary and the cloud tops (Hedman et al. 2007c), through which the
Cassini spacecraft is slated to fly in 2017 during its end-of-mission maneuvers (Seal and Buff-
ington 2009). Models of Jupiter’s rings also find an empty region above the cloud tops, through
which the Juno mission plans to fly in 2016, though this has not been confirmed with definitive
observations.
Outward movement of dust is possible and has been invoked to explain an extension of the
Gossamer ring beyond the orbit of Thebe (Hamilton and Krüger 2008). The mechanism pro-
posed for outward movement is a “shadow resonance” in which dust particles moving through
their planet’s shadow temporarily lose their electrical charge and are carried outward by the
momentum of their electromagnetically influenced orbits. In other locations, such as Saturn’s
G ring, dust evolution is primarily outward because of “plasma drag” from abundant charged
particles co-rotating with the planet’s magnetic field, which orbit at speeds much faster than the
dust’s keplerian velocity since the G ring is far outward of synchronous orbit (Hedman et al.
2007d).
Not all dustyrings consist ofejecta from a single dominant source moon. Several are tenuous
extensions of nearby dense rings, such as the D ring, the dusty sheet in the Roche Division, and
the Lassell ring, which all lie inward of their likely sources, respectively, the C ring, the F ring,
and the Arago ring. The Phoebe ring may also be derived from multiple sources, as it is difficult

354 7
Planetary Rings
for models to account for the ring’s mass from impacts onto Phoebe alone because Phoebe is
so large that it should retain much of its ejecta. However, although Phoebe itself has no known
collisional family, disruptive impacts are known to have broken other large irregular satellites
into pieces that are separately observed today, and it is quite plausible that km-size pieces have
been ejected from Phoebe and continue to share similar orbits. Since, as shown above, km-size
moons are actually the most efficient sources of orbiting dust, the observed dust densities can
be explained by such a distributed population of source bodies (Verbiscer et al. 2009).
The Uranian rings had a very different look (> Fig. 7-28) when the Uranian equinox (an
event occurring every 42 years) was observed in 2007 by the Hubble Space Telescope (de Pater
et al. 2007). With the Sun and the Earth on opposite sides of the Uranian ring plane, the brightest
features in this rare view of the unlit side of the rings had relatively low optical depth but macro-
scopic particles. The dense є ring practically disappeared because its high optical depth made it
opaque, while the dusty λ ring was also dim due to the low phase angle. The brightest feature was
at the location of the η ring and can probably be identified with a low-τ “extension” previously
⊡Fig. 7-28

Telescope near (2004) and at (2007) the Uranian equinox (Figure from de Pater et al. 2007)

seen adjacent to that ring. Some of the dusty rings seen at high phase had bright counterparts
in HST’s unlit-side view, as did a similar “extension” to the δ ring, while others did not. Thus,
the latter are likely pure dust rings, while the former contain a component of larger particles.
A broad innermost ring, which had been given the provisional designation 1986 U2R based
on Voyager images, was also seen in HST’s unlit-side view and named the ζ ring. However, the
core of the ζ ring as seen by HST is several thousand kilometers outward of its position in Voy-
ager images. While acknowledging the possibility that overlapping particle populations with
different optical properties would explain both the mid-phase Voyager observations and the
HST data, de Pater et al. (2007) argue it is more likely that the ζ ring has changed dramatically
in the intervening 20 years.
While most dusty rings are either gray or red in their spectral properties, two known rings
have a prominent blue color: Saturn’s E ring and Uranus’ μ ring (> Fig. 7-29). Each of these
rings is centered on the orbit of a moon – Enceladus and Mab, respectively (de Pater et al. 2006).
For rings made of μm-sized particles, which are close in size to the wavelengths of visible and
infrared light, a blue spectral trend is best explained by a particle-size distribution (regardless of

particle composition) that is either narrowly centered on a particular size or characterized by a
very steep power law (Showalter et al. 1991; de Pater et al. 2004). For Enceladus and the E ring,
the mechanism by which this happens seems well understood: ice particles are spewed from
Enceladus south-polar geysers at a variety of speeds, with smaller particles being more easily
accelerated by gas in the plume, leading to higher velocities that enable them to join the E ring
(Schmidt et al. 2008; Hedman et al. 2009a; Kempf et al. 2010). However, it is harder to imagine
this mechanism applying to the μ ring. Enceladus, with a diameter of ∼500 km, is already so
small that the source of sufficient internal heat to account for its plume is a matter of much
debate (e.g., Meyer and Wisdom 2007, 2008a, b), and Mab has approximately 1/10 the diameter
(and thus 1/1,000 the mass) of Enceladus. A satellite the size of Mab ought to be a good source
of dust liberated by collisions (see above) but that should lead to shallower size distributions
and a redder spectral trend like those of most dusty rings.

Neptune’s iconic ring arcs, known since Voyager and strongly suspected even earlier from
occultation data, have now been joined by several Saturnian structures among the ranks of
ring arcs. All share the common characteristic of an azimuthally confined region of enhanced
brightness embedded within a fainter circumferential ring.13 All known arcs orbit at the
appropriate keplerian rate for their distance from planet center. But there are also significant
differences among known arcs, as they cover a wide range of densities and are caused by at least
two different mechanisms.
Left to itself, any clump of material orbiting a planet should spread out into a ring on a fairly
short timescale. This is a direct result of keplerian shear ( > 7.9), by which two objects with
semimajor axes a and a + δa will have mean motions n and n + δn, where δn = −(n/a)δa,
and the time for one to “lap” the other by an entire orbit is

fore, even for a compact initial clump δa ∼km, the spreading time is only a few decades and
is inversely proportional to δa.
This exercise demonstrates that azimuthal variations in a ring’s mass are not intrinsically
stable. Therefore, the several examples that exist of observed ring arcs must be dynamically gen-
erated or maintained. The two most prominent mechanisms for this are resonant confinement
and asymmetric injection of mass into the ring.
Corotation resonances have resonance argument (see >Sect. 3.1.1) of the form
φ = (m + k)λ′ −mλ −kX′,
(7.14)
where, as for ( > 7.6), m and k are integers that label the resonance as (m+k):m, primed quan-
tities refer to the forcing moon, and X is either ϖ or Ω. For a corotation eccentricity resonance
(CER), X is ϖ and the resonance strength is proportional to the perturbing moon’s eccentric-
ity, while for a corotation inclination resonance (CIR), X is Ω and the resonance strength is
proportional to the perturbing moon’s inclination.
Corotation resonances differ from their Lindblad and vertical cousins (see >Sect. 3.1.1) in
that the lowest-order resonances involve the eccentricity or inclination of the perturbing moon,
rather than that of the particle being perturbed. Thus, rather than pumping up the eccentricities
and inclinations of ring particles and driving waves, corotation resonances tend to azimuthally
confine particles into an orbit commensurate with that of the perturbing moon. This mode of
confinement was first proposed for Neptune’s ring arcs by Goldreich et al. (1986).
3.5.1 Neptune’s Adams Ring
The first-discovered and best-known set of ring arcs are found in Neptune’s Adams ring. These
are the densest components of Neptune’s ring system (with τ⊥∼.) and were oftentimes the
only component detectable in pre-Voyager Earth-based occultations, leading to much confu-
sion as to whether the detected signatures were rings at all until Voyager 2 settled the question.
There are five arcs occupying ∼○out of a region extending over ∼○of longitude (> Figs. 7-9
and >7-30). The three main arcs were named forthe French revolutionaryslogans Liberté, Egal-
ité, and Fraternité, then closer inspection showed a bifurcation in Egalité and a dimmer fourth
arc that was named Courage.
The first integrated dynamical explanation of the arcs was given by Porco (1991), who com-
bined the theoretical framework of Goldreich et al. (1986) with observations showing that the
Adams ring lies very close to a 43:42 resonance with the moon Galatea. Porco (1991) suggested
that the azimuthal confinement mechanism was due to Galatea’s 43:42 corotation inclination
resonance (CIR) while radial spreading due to particle collisions was prevented by Galatea’s
nearby 43:42 outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). This explanation requires both Liberté and Egal-
ité to stretch over multiple consecutive corotation sites (each of which is only14 ○/= .○
long) and predicted that the arcs would orbit at the pattern speed of the 43:42 CIR. A synthesis
of all Voyager and Earth-based data (Nicholson et al. 1995) found two possible solutions for
14Because inclination resonances cannot be first-order (see, e.g., Sect. 10.3.3 of Murray and Dermott 1999), the CIR actually functions as
an 86:84 resonance, which is why the number 86 appears here. For the CER discussed by Namouni and Porco (2002), the corotation sites
would be twice as long.

for schematic view)
the arcs’ pattern speed, one of which was consistent with the Galatea 43:42 CIR, and detailed
dynamical work (Foryta and Sicardy 1996; Hänninen and Porco 1997) supported the plausi-
bility of resonant confinement by this mechanism. However, the reacquisition of the arcs with
Earth-based imaging (Dumas et al. 1999; Sicardy et al. 1999) called the resonant pattern speed
into question, favoring instead Nicholson et al.’s (1995) other solution. An attempt to salvage the
Galatea model was made by Namouni and Porco (2002), who proposed an alternative model
employing the 43:42 corotation eccentricity resonance (CER) rather than the CIR. They fur-
thermore invoked the mass of the ring arcs themselves to adjust the resonant pattern speed to
match the observations, thus deriving a value for the arcs’ mass that is required for their model
to work. Further Earth-based observations (de Pater et al. 2005) not only confirmed that the arcs
are moving at the “wrong” pattern speed for the original Porco (1991) model but showed signif-
icant changes in the arcs’ structure over the 20 years in which they have been observed in detail
(>Fig. 7-30). The brightness of Liberté, already diminished in the 1998 observations, had fur-
therdeclined until it was dimmerthan Courage, while Courage had moved forward in longitude

relative to the other arcs. Egalité has also undergone less dramatic shifts in its morphology and
longitude, while Fraternité appears largely stable.
The Adams arcs remain an enigma. While the model invoking resonant confinement by
Galatea has appeared promising, the details have not come together as hoped. The original
model by Porco (1991) was appealing because its predicted pattern speed appeared to match
very closely with the observations; however, the reworking of the model by Namouni and Porco
(2002) is less convincing because it requires the invocation of an additional free parameter in
order to fit the data. Furthermore, now that other examples of resonantly confined ring arcs have
come to light (see >Sect. 3.5.3), all of which have the morphology predicted by Goldreich et al.
(1986), with maxima at the center of a corotation site and brightness falling off long before the
site’s edges are reached, the objection can be raised anew that Egalité and Fraternité span multi-
ple corotation sites while showing no clear evidence of internal minima at the expected spatial
frequency. On the other hand, the azimuthal structure in Jupiter’s Main ring ( >Sect. 3.5.2),
though far less well observed, appears similar to the Adams arcs in that the spatial frequencies
do not match those of nearby corotation resonances. Perhaps the corotation-resonance model
will be vindicated in the end, or perhaps the answer will be more like the shepherding model of
Lissauer (1985), which invokes yet-undiscovered moons embedded within the Adams ring, or
perhaps the Adams arcs will be found not to be long-term stable structures.
3.5.2 Jupiter’s Main Ring and Other Azimuthal Clumps
In the core ofJupiter’s Main ring, New Horizons images found one close pairofazimuthal clumps
and another family of three to five clumps (Showalter et al. 2007). The semimajor axes of the α
and β clump families, measured from their orbital rates, fall less than 1 km from, respectively,
the Metis 115:116 and 114:115 corotation inclination resonances (CIR), the same kind of reso-
nance originally invoked by Porco (1991) for Neptune’s Adams arcs. Given the distance between
the two semimajor axes and the distance between the resonances, Showalter et al. (2007) esti-
mate the probability of this happening by coincidence to be 4% . Finally, to complete the analogy
with Neptune’s Adams arcs, the 1.8○azimuthal spacing of the clumps does not correspond to
the expected ○/= .○for these resonances (Showalter et al. 2007).
The Adams ring and the Main ring may turn out to be more like Saturn’s F ring and the
ringlets in the Encke Gap ( >Sect. 3.3), which have rich azimuthal structure that is clearly not
associated with a resonant spatial frequency and is most likely due to embedded source moons.
3.5.3 Saturn’s G Ring and Other Moon-Embedded Arcs
Saturn’s G ring was, for a long time, the ring that should not be there. Saturn’s main disk was
clearly a long-term stable structure, the D ring clearly derived from it, the E ring associated
with Enceladus, and the F ring confined by Prometheus and Pandora. Yet the G ring, composed
of dust grains that cannot persist over long time periods, had no apparent mechanism for its
needed continuous generation.
The first step toward addressing this question came with the discovery of a relatively bright
arc within the G ring (Hedman et al. 2007d). The arc is brighter than the rest of the G ring
by a factor of several (but still at τ⊥∼−) and is radially much narrower (∼250 km). It is
very plausible that the rest of the G ring is composed of grains evolving away from the arc

bound to the resonance (i.e., has low libration amplitude) (Figure from Hedman et al. 2007d)
under the influence of nongravitational forces. Furthermore, the arc’s orbital rate matches the
7:6 corotation eccentricity resonance (CER) with Mimas, again invoking the Goldreich et al.
(1986) mechanism. The azimuthal profile of the arc is roughly triangle shaped (> Fig. 7-31),
consistent with a source body with only a small-amplitude libration about the exact resonance,
but has broad wings that plausibly fill the corotation site’s length of ○/= ○in longitude.
A further piece of the puzzle came with the discovery of Aegaeon (Hedman et al. 2010c), a
1-km moon orbiting within the G ring arc. Aegaeon is probably only the largest of a population
of source objects within the arc, as electron-absorption measurements indicate massive objects
spread over a distance much larger than Aegaeon itself (Hedman et al. 2007d).
Two other arcs, even more tenuous than the G ring’s, surround the small moons Anthe and
Methone, both situated between Mimas and Enceladus. A third moon in this vicinity, Pallene,

Planetary Rings 7
361
appears to have a very tenuous ring but not an arc. The Methone arc was first detected by
charged-particle absorptions (Roussos et al. 2008), and all three structures were then seen in
imaging data (Hedman et al. 2009b). Both Anthe and Methone are in resonance with Mimas,
in the 11:10 and 15:14 CERs, respectively, and these resonances continue to confine the arc
material once it has left the source moons (Agarwal et al. 2009). The azimuthal lengths of
the Anthe and Methone arcs are both approximately half that of the available corotation site
(Hedman et al. 2009b), but that may simply reflect the point at which the faint signal falls below
detectability.
Because these ring arcs at Saturn are so much more tenuous than Neptune’s, they are essen-
tially collisionless. This allows them to be confined by the corotation resonance alone, which
is necessary because the associated Lindblad resonances are radially farther away than they are
for Neptune’s case, both because of Saturn’s higher Jcompared to Neptune and because the
resonances have lower azimuthal parameter m, and thus are not available to perform the radial
confinement that was an essential part of the Goldreich et al. (1986) model for the collisional
Adams ring.
Finally, we note that Voyager 2 imaged a faint unnamed ring sharing the orbit of the moon
Galatea, which may be an arc given its intermittent detectability (Showalter and Cuzzi 1992;
Porco et al. 1995). Although little is known about this structure, it can now be placed in context
with the Anthe and Methone arcs and may very well be driven by similar mechanisms.
3.6 Rings as Detectors
Planetary rings have shown themselves to be useful, in many cases, as detectors of planetary
processes around them.
Spiral structures in the D ring, and in the similar tenuous dusty sheet in the Roche Divi-
sion, are driven by Lindblad resonances with the rotation period of the planet’s magnetic field.
These structures are only seen in these tenuous sheets populated by tiny grains that are eas-
ily charged and thus subject to electromagnetic forces. The multiple pattern speeds required to
explain the resonant structures are a major source of information for the complex rotation of
Saturn’s enigmatic magnetic field (Hedman et al. 2009c).
Evidences for vertical corrugations in Jupiter’s Main ring were first seen in Galileo images
(Ockert-Bell et al. 1999; Burns et al. 1999) but were not well understood.Next, Cassini images of
Saturn’s D ring showed evidence of a vertical corrugation whose radial wavelength is decreasing
with time, a trend easily accounted for with a model of differential precession that begins with
the ring as an inclined flat sheet ∼20 years before Cassini’s arrival at Saturn (Hedman et al.
2007c). Images obtained during Saturn’s 2009 equinox showed the vertical corrugation pattern
extending far into the C ring, and the variation of the wavelength with radius confirms the
previous result that the pattern originated in 1983 when an event of some kind caused the ring
to be tilted by ∼−radians (a few meters) with respect to the Laplace plane (Hedman et al.
2011d). Finally, similar analysis of the corrugations in Jupiter’s Main ring yields a superposition
of wavelengths implying two tilting events, one in July 1994 and one in 1990 (Showalter et al.
2011b). July 1994 is, of course, the date of the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) into
Jupiter, leading to the hypothesis that both corrugation patterns carry records of the impact
of a spatially dispersed cloud, which is one mechanism for spreading the impulse over a large
portion of the ring. The cloud of dust surrounding SL9 would likely fill the bill at Jupiter, and
either a similar cometary system or a meteor stream could be the cause of the Saturn event.

362 7
Planetary Rings
Saturn’s rings showed themselves capable of more direct detections of impactors during the
2009 equinox event. Bright markings, canted with respect to the azimuthal direction, were seen
on both the A ring and the C ring during the few days before and after the Sun’s passage through
the ring midplane (Tiscareno et al. 2009b). Assuming that these are dust clouds evolving under
keplerian shear ( >7.9), one can calculate the time elapsed since the cloud was radially aligned.
In one case, the same cloud was seen 24 h apart, and the ages derived from keplerian shear
differed by the same interval, confirming this interpretation of the observed structures. Also,
in very high-phase high-resolution images of the C ring (not during equinox), small streaks
appear that are probably transitory dust clouds produced by impacts (Tiscareno et al. 2009b).
Both of these discoveries have the potential to use rings observations to constrain the influx
of interplanetary impactors, though the derivation of impactor size from observed dust-cloud
parameters has yet to be worked out.
Spiral waves and wavy gap edges are both the result of gravitational forcing due to moons.
In the case of Janus and Epimetheus, the nature of the forcing changes with time, and the ring
maintains a record of that change. Initial steps toward understanding the nature of the rings’
record have been made for both density waves (Tiscareno et al. 2006b) and wavy edges (Spitale
and Porco 2009). In the case of spiral density waves, the group velocity at which information
propagates through the wave is slow enough that information can be gained about the state of
the co-orbital moons as much as 10 years prior to the time of observation.

Experimental Rings Science
4.1 Numerical Simulations
Advances in simulation techniques, alongside advances in computing hardware and software,
have allowed numerical simulations to become an increasingly important part of the study of
planetary rings. Modern n-body dynamics exploded after Wisdom and Holman (1991) pub-
lished a symplectic mapping that uses Hamiltonian methods to calculate perturbations as a
deviation from keplerian orbit, rather than as deviations from motion in a straight line, and thus
requires fewer correction events per unit of simulated time. This, along with ever-increasing
computer power, allowed large n-body simulations to become routine; among the many solar
system applications is the case of dusty rings evolving under gravity and other forces. For dense
rings, though, the number of mutually interacting particles is too large for simulations that
follow particles along their full orbits about the planet. Instead, for cases that do not focus
on large-scale azimuthal structure, a very productive line of simulations follows a relatively
small “patch” of the ring with sliding boundary conditions as devised by Wisdom and Tremaine
(1988). The patch is surrounded by “mirror” patches (> Fig. 7-32); those on either side in the
azimuthal direction are stationary, so that a particle that leaves the patch on one side simply
reappears on the opposite side, but the neighboring patches in the radial direction slide past
according to keplerian shear ( > 7.9). Even with their greatly reduced spatial dimensions, ring-
patch simulations routinely include so many mutually interacting particles that they push the
limits of the available computing power, and several approaches to efficiently accounting for
their mutual interactions have been devised.
The first great success of ring-patch simulations, and a continuing area of their useful-
ness, is the characterization of self-gravity wakes (SGWs) ( >Sect. 3.1.4). First described by

Julian and Toomre (1966) for the case of galaxies, it was understood by the 1980s that this
non-axisymmetric structure due to a balance between accretion and disruption was likely
present in Saturn’s A and B rings and was likely responsible for the observer-centered quadrant
azimuthal asymmetry observed in the A ring’s brightness (Colombo et al. 1976; Franklin
et al. 1987; Dones and Porco 1989). SGWs were successfully produced in ring-patch simula-
tions by Salo (1992, 1995) and by Richardson (1994), and simulations continue to be a vital
tool for understanding the mechanics and structure of SGWs and comparing their simulated
photometric properties to observational data, as well as other ring properties including the rota-
tional states and thermal properties of ring particles, and the mechanics of sharp edges and
propellers (for details and references, see Schmidt et al. 2009).
An entirely different class of simulations are the semianalytical streamline models of Hahn
(2007, 2008) and Hahn et al. (2009), which use the theoretical framework of Borderies-
Rappaport and Longaretti (1994, and references therein) to probe the distribution of surface
density, pressure, and viscosity of a ring in the vicinity of a sharp edge.

4.2 Physical Experiments and the Coeﬃcient of Restitution
What happens when two ring particles collide? Gentle collisions, with velocities of order
mm s−, occur constantly (frequencies of order the orbital frequency) within dense rings. A law
describing the coefficient ofrestitution ε (the ratiobetween outgoing and incoming kineticener-
gies for two colliding particles in their center-of-mass reference frame) is an essential input for
numerical simulations. A number of physical experiments have been conducted to measure the
coefficient of restitution directly, but these must begin with assumptions as to the shape, poros-
ity, and surface friction of ring particles. Consequently, the results of these experiments have
been inconsistent. More recently, comparisons between simulations and data have attempted to
arrive empirically at a favored coefficient of restitution law, from which ring-particle properties
can then be inferred.
Bridges et al. (1984) conducted groundbreaking experiments for determining the colli-
sional properties of icy objects, using a double-pendulum apparatus to achieve the exceedingly
low collision velocities seen in ring systems. They found relations for εn, as a function of
mutual incoming velocity vn (the subscript denotes normal collisions), for frosty ice spheres
at temperatures of ∼200 K. Their result,
εn = (vn
vc
)
b
,
(7.15)
with exponent b = −.and critical velocity vc = .cm s−, has been widely used in
numerical simulations ever since. Further experiments broadened the range of particle proper-
ties tested. Hatzes et al. (1988, 1991) found that a frost layer on the surface can greatly increase
the lossiness of a collision (i.e., depress ε), even leading to sticking at low collision velocities.
Dilley and Crawford (1996) varied the mass of the incoming particles and found that smaller ice
balls led to lossier collisions. Supulver et al. (1995) found less lossy collisions overall (( > 7.15)
with b = −.and vc = .cm s−)forfrost-free spheres at ∼100 K and alsofound that glancing
collisions are less lossy than normal collisions. Initial results from experiments in a micrograv-
ity environment were given by Colwell et al. (2008) and Heißelmann et al. (2010), while Durda
et al. (2011) measured the coefficient of restitution for two 1-m granite spheres colliding at low
speeds.
All collision experiments thus far have representedring particles as hard spheres of HO ice.
The actual shape of ring particles is not known; they are far too small to be sphericalized by
hydrostatic equilibrium and might be expected to be roughly ellipsoidal if they take the shape
of their Roche lobes. Their surfaces may be smoothed by the numerous gentle collisions they
experience, after the manner of pebbles in a stream bed, but this also is not known. Finally, ring
particles are almost certainly not as hard as solid ice, as their outer layers at least are probably
quite porous ( >Sect. 1.2).
Eventually, the role of physical experiments will ideally shift from determining a preferred
restitution law based on an assumption of ring-particle properties, to using an empirically indi-
cated restitution law to infer ring-particle properties. A steptoward this goal was taken by Porco
et al. (2008), who compared numerical simulations with Voyager imaging data of the azimuthal
asymmetry to arrive at a preliminary conclusion favoring a lower coefficient of restitution (i.e.,
lossier collisions) than given by the prevailing Bridges et al. (1984) law. They favored instead a
law with the form (Borderies et al. 1984)

This law is based on the Andrews (1930) theory of colliding spheres, but the more flexible for-
mulation of Borderies et al. (1984) allows v∗to be a free parameter adjusting the law’s lossiness.
Porco et al. (2008) favored a value of v∗= .cm s−; however, a full treatment of the question,
incorporating the substantial Cassini data set, has yet to be completed. A plot of coefficient of
restitution distributions derived from a variety of laws is shown in >Fig. 7-33.
In addition to the azimuthal photometric asymmetry, both the photometry of propellers
( >Sect. 3.1.5) and the sharpness of gap edges ( >Sect. 3.1.2) have the potential of being used to
constrain the physical properties of ring particles by combining data with simulations, though
work on these lines is just beginning. Propellers are large enough to appear in images with a
reasonable amount of detail, but small enough that particle-particle interactions play a signif-
icant role in determining their structure (e.g., Lewis and Stewart 2009), although their poorly
understood photometry (Tiscareno et al. 2010c), possibly due to vertical structure, may make
it difficult to use them as a standard. Occultation data infer edges in Saturn’s rings as sharp
as 10–20 m (Colwell et al. 2010), significantly sharper than the edges obtained in simulations
using the standard Bridges et al. (1984) restitution law (Weiss 2005), while preliminary results
from simulations with lossier restitution laws yield sharper edges more in line with observations
(J.E. Colwell 2010, personal communication).
4.3 Spectroscopic Ground Truth
The project of characterizing the optical properties of materials occurring in the outer solar
system is ongoing. A large amount of spectroscopic data now exists for the rings of Jupiter
and Saturn, in spectral ranges from the infrared to the ultraviolet, that contain numerous
bands that are potentially diagnostic of ring-particle composition and/or particle size and
state. Laboratory measurements of candidate ring-forming materials are compared to these

observations in an effort to constrain the chemical and physical composition of the rings. For
details and references, see Cuzzi et al. (2009).

Age and Origin of Ring Systems
The question of the age of a ring system is actually two separate questions, one being the age of
the material and the other the age of the structure currently in place. This distinction is particu-
larly important for diffuse dusty rings ( >Sect. 3.4). For example, if Amalthea, Thebe, Adrastea,
and Metis were to suddenly disappear, or to suddenly cease emitting dust, Jupiter’s rings would
dissipate on a timescale on the order of years at the most (Burns et al. 2001). Thus, the age
of individual particles in a diffuse ring is on the order of the mean residence time, while the age
of the overall structure is related to how long the sources have been in place.
The distinction between material age and overall structural age also turns out to be useful
for Saturn’s main rings. Several aspects of the rings are difficult to reconcile with a ring age
comparable to that of Saturn (see Charnoz et al. 2009a, and references therein), including (1)
the ≳95% water ice composition of the A and B rings is difficult to reconcile with the constant
pollution of the rings by infall of interplanetary micrometeoroids; (2) the same infall should
significantly erode ring particles, especially in regions of lower optical depth; and (3) exchange
of angular momentum with moons currently confining ring edges can only be “rewound” for
∼year. On the other hand, the disruption of a Sun-orbiting object containing sufficient mass
in such a way as to form a ring system is an unlikely event given the recent state of the solar
system, and Saturn is actually the least likely of the planets to capture an interloper because the
balance of mass and solar distance gives it the smallest Hill sphere among the giant planets,
leading to some doubts as to the viability of the young-rings scenario (Charnoz et al. 2009b).
One potentially viable theory suggests that the B ring core is ancient, dating from the first
Gyr of the solar system in which collisions were much more frequent (Charnoz et al. 2009b),
but that much of the specific organization of material in Saturn’s rings is only ∼year old.
Recent indications that the B ring’s mass has previously been underestimated (see >Sect. 3.1.4
and Robbins et al. 2010) provide an increased buffer against interplanetary pollution (Elliott
and Esposito 2011), as well as making the ring precursor body even larger and thus a recent
ring origin even more unlikely. Erosion of ring particles can be counteracted by an accretion-
driven recycling process (Durisen et al. 1989; Esposito 2006) and is also slowed if ring particles
have spent most of their history in a denser structure than those where they are now found. The
current ring-moons may also have formed within the rings and emerged only recently (Charnoz
et al. 2010). Many questions still remain, however (Charnoz et al. 2009a). The mass of the B ring
needs to be better known, as may well happen as a result of the planned close passes during
Cassini’s end-of-mission maneuvers (Seal and Buffington 2009) both through direct sensing of
the ring’s gravitational pull and through its interaction with charged particles and gamma rays
(the latter improving on the Pioneer 11 measurement reported by Cooper et al. 1985). Also
needed are improvements in knowledge of the interplanetary impactor flux throughout the
history of the rings. The proposed recycling mechanism has yet to be carefully described and
modeled. And any theory for the formation of Saturn’s rings, whether the age be young or old,
requires careful separation of water ice from any silicate and/or metal that must have been part
of any body accreting directly from the protoplanetary nebula.

Planetary Rings 7
367
Canup (2010) recently suggested that Saturn’s rings might have been formed by the disrup-
tion of a Titan-sized (∼2,500-km radius) proto-moon near the end of the planetary formation
period during which the circumplanetary gas disk is present. Due to its size, the proto-moon is
differentiated, and as it spirals inward due to interaction with the disk, it first passes the Roche
radius for ice (see >Sect. 1.2) and its icy mantle is stripped away. Furthermore, because the
incompletely consolidated Saturn would have been ∼50% larger than at present, the proto-
moon is engulfed by the planet before reaching the Roche radius for its rocky core, thus
explaining the rings’ icy composition. The initially resulting ring is ∼1,000 times more mas-
sive than that of today, but Salmon et al. (2010) showed that viscous spreading of a ring over
the age of the solar system can lead to a ring like that of today with relatively little sensitiv-
ity to the ring’s initial mass (> Fig. 7-34). Supersizing the argument of Charnoz et al. (2010),
Canup (2010) suggested that some of Saturn’s midsize moons (with radii of hundreds of kilome-
ters) may have been spawned by the viscous spreading of this massive ring, accounting for their
relatively low densities (cf. >Sect. 1.2), and Charnoz et al. (2011) in turn have explored this
scenario in more detail. The details of the Canup (2010) simulations are conducted in the con-
text of that author’s theory for circumplanetary disks (e.g., Canup and Ward 2002, 2006), which
has been criticized by some (e.g., Mosqueira and Estrada 2003). However, the basic outline
of the Canup (2010) story appears to have plausible merit even beyond its specific theoretical
context.
The rings of Uranus and Neptune, with their lower masses and much darker surfaces, have
more plausibly remained little changed over the age of the solar system. The Uranian rings, as
well as the nearby group of moons, may be part of a system that has oscillated between accre-
tion and disruption for many Gyr ( >Sect. 2.3). But why are the rings where they are? Is the
dynamical environment such that a uniform supply of material at all distances from the planet
would result in the rings as we see them today? Or was the supply of source material somehow
confined to the locations at which we now see rings? On the planetary level, why does Saturn
have its glorious broad dense disk while Uranus and Neptune have much more modest systems
and Jupiter has only moon-generated dust? None of these questions has a clear answer as yet.

Rings and Other Disks
Planetary rings are just one variety among many disk-shaped systems known to astronomers,
but they are the only variety that is not exceedingly far away in time or space or both and thus
that is available for close inspection (Burns and Cuzzi 2006). Other astrophysical disks include
proto-planetary, protolunar, and protosatellite disks as theorized for the origins of our solar
system and as presently observed as gas disks, dust disks, and debris disks at other stars. They
also include accretion disks for binary stars, black holes, active galactic nuclei, etc.
Some examples offruitful cross-pollination between planetaryrings studies and otherastro-
physical disks follow. The interpretation of the inner edge of the Fomalhaut disk in terms of a
resonant confinement as seen in planetary rings (Kalas et al. 2005) was validated by the discov-
ery of Fomalhaut b (Kalas et al. 2008). The dynamics of eccentric rings like Uranus’ є ring have
been extended and applied to astrophysical eccentric disks such as “superhump” binary star sys-
tems (Lubow 2010). Both spiral waves ( >Sect. 3.1.1) and self-gravity wakes ( >Sect. 3.1.4) were
first proposed as physical processes likely to occur in galactic disks, with specific applications
to planetary rings coming a decade or more later. But the shoe is now on the other foot, with
direct observations of spiral waves and of SGWs in planetary rings having become so detailed
that they can potentially inform understanding of similar processes occurring in galaxies.
A similar process may soon occur with free unstable normal modes, which have long been seen
in numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks (Laughlin et al. 1997) and have now likely
been observed directly in Saturn’s B ring (Spitale and Porco 2010). Finally, the orbital evolution
of disk-embedded “propeller” moons and the nature of their interaction with the disk is only
just beginning to be directly observed in Saturn’s rings ( > Sect. 3.1.5), potentially shedding
light on the evolution of planetesimals and other disk-embedded masses.

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
Abstract:
The asteroids are a population of millions of small bodies found throughout the
inner solar system but concentrated between Mars and Jupiter and ranging in size from hun-
dreds of kilometers to meter-sized or smaller. Samples of asteroids are available in the form
of meteorites, affording the opportunity for a unique synergy between geochemical and astro-
nomical study. From laboratory and remote sensing studies, it is apparent that the asteroids
harbor a range of compositions from metallic cores of once-molten bodies to primitive, ice-
rich mixtures. This range of compositions is used to place constraints on the heating and cooling
histories of asteroids. While igneous processes ceased on the asteroids very early on in solar sys-
tem history, they have been heavily impacted since they formed. These impacts have generated
regolith on asteroids of even small size, as well as formed craters, and in some cases entirely
disrupted the target asteroids. As a result, most asteroids appear to be rubble piles, collections
of material held together by little more than gravity and small-scale cohesive forces. Dynamical
families are also created via impacts, with nongravitational forces affecting their orbits since
their formation. The large number of asteroids, both in and out of families, has made them use-
ful as test masses, allowing dynamicists to probe conditions early in solar system history, just
as geochemists do with meteorites, and to model and constrain the motions of the larger plan-
ets. This chapter will provide a broad overview of asteroidal studies from the compositional to
geophysical, from surfaces to cores.

Introduction
The understanding of the asteroids and meteorites is critical to understanding the history and
evolution of the solar system. However, there is more than one way to define what an asteroid
is, usually in opposition to the comets, their sibling small bodies. These definitions can be seen
as compositional, dynamical, and observational.
The longest-standing definition for asteroids is that they are solar system bodies that are
point sources even in large telescopes at high magnification. Herschel found Ceres and Pallas to
be starlike shortly after their discovery and dubbed them “asteroids” for their appearance. Over
the intervening centuries, the Minor Planet Center and other workers distinguished comets
from asteroids by the presence or absence of a coma and/or tail. This remains the main dis-
criminator between comets and asteroids today, as large telescopes, space telescopes, radar
experiments, and adaptive optics have rendered Herschel’s original name inaccurate for at least
some objects.
Most asteroids are found in-between Mars and Jupiter, with significant populations lead-
ing and trailing Jupiter near the Lagrange points and within the orbit of Mars. As discussed
in
> Sect. 2. The Tisserand parameter is conserved after encounters with Jupiter and can
be used to judge the likelihood of an object originating in the inner or outer solar sys-
tem. This has given rise to another means of distinguishing asteroids, as small bodies that
formed in the inner solar system regardless of their appearance. As an outgrowth of the two
previous classification schemes, a third composition-based definition has arisen with aster-
oids generally considered objects made of rock or rock and metal, while comets are ice-rock
mixtures.
In practice, the vast majority of objects can be classified unambiguously either as asteroids
or not. However, there are important populations that seem to straddle the comet/asteroid line

or qualify as asteroids in some but not all definitions. Extinct comets, which have exhausted
their supply of near-surface volatiles, lack comae and tails and appear asteroidal. The origin
of the Trojan asteroids near 5 AU remains uncertain, with recent models suggesting they may
have formed in the transneptunian region and later been transported to their current orbits
(Morbidelli et al. 2005). The “main-belt comets” or “activated asteroids” are observed to have
typical main-belt orbits but also harbor tails and are interpreted to have icy compositions.
Recent work suggests some of the largest asteroids may have substantial complements of ice
( >Sect. 5) and some objects have been observed to have ice on their surfaces ( >Sect. 2).
The IAU’s adoption ofa definition forplanets has alsoaffected the asteroids. The IAU scheme
created a category of “dwarf planets,” which are massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equi-
librium, but did not have a mass high enough to “clear their neighborhood” early in solar
system history (though “neighborhood clearing” involved factors in addition to mass). Ceres,
the largest object in the asteroid belt, is formally classified as a dwarf planet by the IAU, the
only non-TNO so classified at present. All other objects in the asteroid belt (as well as the NEO
and Trojan populations) are classified as “small solar system bodies” by the IAU, a catch-all
term that includes both comets and asteroids. Vesta seems likely to have achieved hydrostatic
equilibrium early in its history (probably during differentiation and/or shortly thereafter), but a
large impact subsequently changed its shape, and it has not returned to hydrostatic equilibrium.
While Vesta is not currently classed as a dwarf planet, it is possible that future refinements to
the IAU classification system will include it in that category. Pallas is slightly larger than Vesta,
but slightly less massive. Observations of Pallas have not provided us with the detail available
for Ceres or Vesta, but similarly, it appears to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium (> Figs. 8-1
and >8-2).
Other populations not discussed in detail in this chapter may also have begun their exis-
tence as asteroids before removal from the asteroid belt. Phobos and Deimos, the satellites of
Mars, have the physical appearance of asteroids and share spectral characteristics with outer-
belt asteroids. Indeed, before the Galileo encounters with Gaspra and Ida, Phobos and Deimos
were used as asteroid proxies when considering main-belt objects. However, the origin of Pho-
bos and Deimos is still not clear, and each of the leading theories has strengths and drawbacks:
capture from the asteroid belt is difficult to explain from a dynamical point of view given the
current orbits of the two bodies, while formation in their current locations (or as Mars ejecta)
is difficult to reconcile with their spectral properties (Burns 1992). Our knowledge of the Mar-
tian satellites has been gained largely through observation by spacecraft whose first priority was
Mars, and the loss of Phobos-Grunt, a planned Russian sample return from Phobos, will post-
pone our understanding further. A hoped for reflight of Phobos-Grunt would be able to place
its relationship to the asteroids in sharper focus (Galimov 2010).
Beyond Mars, the outer planets host over 100 irregular satellites, with 55 orbiting Jupiter
alone. It is thought that all of these objects were captured into their current orbits from the small
body population, most likely from the TNO population (Nicholson et al. 2008). However, the
Jovian irregular satellites have spectra consistent with the Trojan asteroids, outer-belt asteroids,
or in some cases mid-belt asteroids. Furthermore, while the “Nice model” predicts irregular
satellite populations captured from TNOs for Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune that are consistent
with observations, it cannot reproduce the Jovian population (Nesvorný et al. 2007). This leaves
open the possibility that the irregular satellites of Jupiter were captured from the asteroid belt, in
contrast to a Jupiter Trojan asteroid population that could be captured from TNOs (Morbidelli
et al. 2005).

⊡Fig. 8-1
The two most massive asteroids, 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, give only tantalizing hints of their surfaces
even in themost powerful telescopes. However, Earth-based observationshavebeen ableto deter-
mine the shapes of these objects, allowing Ceres to be classiﬁed as a “dwarf planet,”while the large
crater near Vesta’s south pole (seen in proﬁle along the lower right edge of Vesta in the right panel)
takes it out of consideration in the current IAU scheme. The arrival of the Dawn spacecraft at each
of these bodies during this decade will produce a ﬂood of high-resolution data (Image taken by
the Hubble Space Telescope, reproduced courtesy of NASA)
While the large end of the asteroid size range is addressed by the proposed IAU classifica-
tion, the small end is less well-defined. Dust bands in the asteroid belt are derived from asteroid
disruptions, but the dust grains themselves are not generally considered asteroids. An informal
distinction is sometimes made with objects smaller than a given size (sometimes 50 m) termed
“meteoroids,” though this term is often reserved for objects that will hit Earth. Recent NEO
surveys have been able to discover meter-scale objects, which are usually termed (and always
classified as) asteroids rather than meteoroids. The difficulty of observing, tracking, and char-
acterizing centimeter-scale bodies in space probably makes their classification of little practical
use, but they could be considered to be a qualitatively intermediate group between asteroids
(large enough to survive atmospheric entry) and dust (small enough to be affected by radiation
pressure and/or Poynting-Robertson drag).
While dust is not covered in this chapter, its study is an important, if often underappreci-
ated, part of planetary studies (Dermott et al. 2002). Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are
collected and studied as the tiny meteorites they are, and zodiacal clouds of such dust are stud-
ied in both our solar system and also in other stellar systems. It is generally accepted that a large

A handful of asteroids have been encountered by spacecraft at this writing. This compilation, by
Emily Lakdawalla and Ted Stryk, shows these asteroids (as well as targets of cometary encounters)
to scale, from the ∼100 km-sized 21 Lutetia to the ∼300 m-sized 25143 Itokawa. These asteroids all

fraction, perhaps the dominant fraction, of IDPs originated on comets rather than asteroids
(see Nesvorný et al. 2010b, for instance).
In the following sections, the study of asteroids and meteorites is divided into three dis-
ciplines. First, the dynamics of asteroids, including a discussion of dynamical families and
binary systems, are considered. Next, the surfaces of asteroids and the processes that affect
those surfaces are addressed. In the third section, asteroid interiors and geophysics are stud-
ied. Finally, the compositions of asteroids, including the wealth of information gained from
meteorite studies, are addressed. Naturally, it is impossible to cover material in great depth in a
single chapter, so references are provided for further study including both primary and review
papers.
A list of particularly interesting asteroids is included as >Table 8-1.

Dynamics of Asteroids
2.1 Gravitational and Nongravitational Forces
Asteroids can be found in practically every region of the inner solar system where their orbits
are stable on long timescales and in some regions where they are not. The vast majority of them
are found in the main asteroid belt, stretching roughly from 1.9 to 3.4 AU. Eighty seven percent
of known objects have inclinations between 0○and 15○. However, sizeable populations can be
found outside the main belt near 5.2 AU (the Trojans) and 4.0 AU (the Hildas) as well as on
orbits inside the main belt both in-between and crossing the orbits of the inner planets.
The shape of the asteroid belt in orbital element space is controlled by resonances. Mean-
motion resonances occur where the orbital period is an integral fraction of a planet, for the
asteroids almost always Jupiter. Secular resonances occur where the precession of an orbit
matchesthat of a planet. The most important mean-motion resonance for sculpting the asteroid
belt is the 3:1 with Jupiter, occurring near 2.5 AU.
An object in a resonant orbit finds its orbit modified by the unbalanced tug of a planet’s
gravity. The orbital eccentricity will increase until its orbit begins to cross that of Mars,
where it can undergo encounters or impacts with that planet. Until an encounter (or impact)
removes the body from the resonance, eccentricity continues to increase until the orbit crosses

the Earth’s, Venus’, and Mercury’s in turn. If it manages to remain in resonance without impact-
ing a planet, the body will eventually have its eccentricity raised high enough to impact the Sun
(Gladman et al. 1997). During orbital evolution, the quantity (a(−e))/cos i(see below) is
conserved, and thus objects can move from highly eccentric to highly inclined orbits and back
again through time.

crossing orbits in a–e space.

The objects interior to the asteroid belt are of particular interest because of their accessibil-
ity and the hazard they pose. An asteroid whose orbit passes inside that of Mars but remains
outside 1.3 AU is classified as a Mars-crosser. Objects with perihelia less than 1.3 AU are clas-
sified as near-Earth objects (NEOs). This population contains both asteroidal and cometary
objects, though is thought to be dominated by the former: Stuart and Binzel (2004) used the
differing spectral properties of cometary nuclei and inner-belt asteroids (see >Sect. 2) and the
frequency with which comet-like spectra appear in the NEO population, corrected for biases
due to differing albedos, to put an upper limit of 17% on the cometary contribution (in the
>1 km size range). Dynamically, the likelihood of an NEO originating beyond Jupiter’s orbit
(and thus being “cometary”) is often assessed using the Tisserand parameter Tj:
Tj = a j/a + (a/a j(−e))/cosi,
where a j denotes the semimajor axis of Jupiter. This value is quasi-conserved, remaining close
to the same value before and after encounters with Jupiter. For asteroids, Tj is typically greater
than 3, while for comets, it is less than 3. NEOs are often further classified based on their orbits:
Amors orbit entirely outside Earth’s orbit. Apollos have semimajor axes greater than the Earth’s,
but perihelia inside Earth’s orbit, while Atens are the reverse, mostly orbiting interior to Earth
but crossing its orbit for aphelion.
In addition to the effect of resonances, nongravitational forces also can move asteroids. The
most important is the Yarkovsky force (Bottke et al. 2006). The Yarkovsky force results from
the nonalignment between the average insolation vector for an object (pointing from the Sun)
and the average emission vector (pointing from the hottest part of the body). Objects with finite
thermal inertia are hottest in the afternoon, which for prograde rotators is in the direction away
from orbital motion. The extra emission in that direction causes a small momentum transfer
that serves to speed up the object and increase its orbit size. For retrograde rotators, the opposite
is true and the orbit decays. This is the “diurnal Yarkovskyeffect.” The “seasonal Yarkovskyeffect”
is similar, except its concern is the hottest time of the year rather than the day. For the seasonal
case, the component of extra emission is always in the direction of orbital motion and therefore
it always serves to decrease orbit size. The YORP force, discussed further below, is related to the
Yarkovsky force but results in a torque on the body rather than a momentum change.
The Yarkovsky force is critically dependent upon the thermal properties of an object.
Measurement of Yarkovsky-induced deflection has been achieved for the NEO 6489 Golevka
(Chesley et al. 2003). This measurement has been used to constrain Golevka’s density, assum-
ing typical thermal properties of rock. Given the magnitude of the Yarkovsky force and typical
thermal properties of asteroids, it is most effective on objects in the ∼10 m size range, with
appreciable effects still possible up to 1–10 km diameters given long enough timescales. Larger
objects are simply too massive for the Yarkovsky effect to be effective, while smaller objects
become isothermal and the force goes to zero.
Bottke et al. (2002) numerically modeled the orbital evolution of asteroidal population as a
whole, including gravitational and nongravitational effects, estimating the fraction of the NEO
population derived from six pathways: those that came to near-Earth space via the νresonance,
via the 3:1 resonance, from the outer asteroid belt, the Jupiter family comets (JFCs), the ecliptic
comets, and via low-inclination, Mars-crossing orbits with semimajor axes within the main
asteroid belt (IMCs). These pathways ultimately connect the NEO population with the major
reservoirs of small bodies in the solar system: the Hungaria, main-belt, and Trojan asteroids,
the transneptunian region, and the Oort cloud.

386 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
Bottke et al. found the νresonance tobe the most common pathwayforNEOs, with roughly
37% of objects entering near-Earth space via that route. The 3:1 and IMCs each accounted for
20–25% of NEOs, with the outer-belt and JFC pathways splitting the remaining 15%.
2.2 Orbital Stability and Lifetime of NEOs
As mentioned at the start of this section, and unlike objects in the main belt, near-Earth objects
experience rapid orbital evolution and have relatively short lifetimes. Close encounters with
planets alter orbital elements and in combination with resonances result in complicated trajec-
tories through orbital element phase space. Those NEOs with a >∼2.5 AU can encounter Jupiter
during periods of high eccentricity and are preferentially ejected from the solar system by that
planet as a final fate unless they enter a resonance and/or encounter the inner planets and lower
their semimajor axis. For NEOs with smaller semimajor axes (a <∼2.5), the most likely fate is
impact into the Sun when the eccentricity is high enough. Other possibilities include impacts
into the terrestrial planets or the Moon (Morbidelli et al. 2002).
The amount of time spent in the near-Earth region by an object (before it is removed dynam-
ically) is affected by the pathway it used to enter near-Earth space. Those objects that enter via
resonances have shorter lifetimes than those that diffuse from the inner asteroid belt. The mean
lifetime in all asteroidal cases is of order 1–10 Myr, with very few surviving as long as 100 Myr
(Bottke et al. 2002). In order to keep a steady-state population, Bottke et al. predict a flux of
±objects of H < 18 (or larger than roughly 1 km in diameter) per Myr from the asteroid
belt into the NEO population. They also calculate that this rate implies a mass loss of roughly
5% from the main belt over the last 3 Gyr.
2.3 Collisional Evolution and Families
Dohnanyi (1969) showed that given certain simplifying assumptions, the population of aster-
oids would reach an equilibrium size-frequency distribution (SFD) with a cumulative diameter
powerlaw slope of−2.5, that is, N(>D)∼D−.where N(>D)is the numberofobjects largerthan
D km. While laterwork included several additional important effects, including self-gravitation,
the Dohnanyi power law slope is still often used as a point of reference. The observed SFD is
consistent with a population in collisional equilibrium.
It is thought that all of the objects in the main belt larger than roughly 10 km have been dis-
covered, and it is seen that the SFD departs from power law behavior, with a “wavy” appearance.
Several workers using different techniques have estimated roughly 1 million objects of 1 km or
larger in the asteroid belt, though the exact number varies by ±30% in the literature (Morbidelli
and Vokrouhlický 2003; Tedesco and Desert 2002; Ivezi´c et al. 2002; Bottke et al. 2005).
Durda et al. (1998) looked at the SFD in detail to extract the strength properties of the
population, also concluding its “wavy” nature reflected the original SFD of the asteroids. The
nature ofthe original “hump” nearsizes of∼100 km has remained somewhat mysterious, though
very recent work by Morbidelli et al. (2009) suggest centimeter- to meter-sized bodies coalesced
due to turbulence in the solar nebula to form objects of roughly this size, which would then
represent the original size of planetesimals.
The collisional lifetime of asteroids in the asteroid belt is dependent on diameter; as objects
become larger, fewer objects are capable of overcoming the target’s gravitational binding energy

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
387
to lead to disruption. O’Brien and Greenberg (2005) modeled the main-belt and NEO popula-
tions and found a fairly flat collisional lifetime of ∼7 Myr for meter-scale objects, varying little
for the 10 cm–100 m diameter range. However, it rapidly increases between 100 m and 10 km,
reaching 1 Gyr at roughly 1 km, and the age of the solar system by a few kilometers. Given
the short lifetime of NEOs versus removal via impact into the Sun or a planet (or for some,
ejection by Jupiter), collisional evolution is not important for this population.
The mean impact speed for objects in the asteroid belt is roughly 5 km/s, though individ-
ual objects will experience different values and relatively wider or narrower spreads of impact
speeds depending upon their eccentricity and inclination (Bottke et al. 1994). These impact
speeds result in ejecta that typically moves at m/s to several tens of m/s. This is enough to over-
come the escape speed of most objects, but not enough to lead to large immediate dispersion
between the orbit of the impacted object and that of its ejecta. As a result, dynamical families
of asteroids with similar orbital elements are created after impacts. The largest of these were
recognized in the early twentieth century by Hirayama (1918): Eos, Koronis, Themis, Maria,
and Flora. By convention, families are named after their lowest-numbered member.
Dynamical families are typically recognized based on similarity among orbital elements.
Proper elements are used rather than osculating elements, which have potentially changed sig-
nificantly with time. However, proper elements require orbit simulations to be performed. The
dramatic increase in asteroid discoveries in the 1990s along with increased computing power
led to more refined and reliable family identification techniques, as described in Bendjoya and
Zappalà (2002).
A combined dynamical and spectroscopic approach is often used to distinguish family
members from unrelated objects with coincidentally similar orbital elements (usually called
“interlopers” or members of the “background population”). This technique is most useful in sit-
uations where the family membershave significant spectral differences from the typical asteroid
in that part of the asteroid belt: for instance, the S-class Koronis family in the C-dominated outer
belt, or the spectrally unusual K-class Eos family or V-class Vesta family. Early workers antici-
pated the presence of spectrally diverse families as an outcome of the breakup of differentiated
objects, but spectral studies have not found any convincing evidence for such families. Instead,
those families that have been studied in detail show remarkable spectral similarity (Bus 1999).
This is suggestive of either a great rarity of families derived from differentiated objects or else
the mixing and homogenizing of material in catastrophic impacts to a scale that results in family
members emerging with very similar bulk compositions (Michel et al. 2002) or a combination
of both.
Durda et al. (2007) modeled the formation of prominent dynamical families by analyzing
the size-frequency distribution of current-day fragments, constraining the properties of the
original parent bodies for the largest families. They found that roughly 20 families were cre-
ated by the catastrophic disruption of objects greater than 100 km in diameter, with the largest
including the Themis family (original D ∼450 km) and Eos family (∼380 km). The differing
SFDs of various families also provide information about their formation. Durda et al., follow-
ing earlier workers, defined cratering versus catastrophic collisions as those where the largest
remaining fragment was greater than 50% of the original mass versus those where it was 50%
or less. Cratering collisions result from less-energetic collisions than catastrophic ones. Most
of the families associated with the largest asteroids are modeled as cratering impacts by Durda
et al., like Juno, Vesta, and Hygiea.
With the (re)discovery of the Yarkovsky effect and its inclusion in dynamical studies,
it became possible to estimate the ages of some families based on the spread of their orbits.

388 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
Jedicke et al. (2004) used spectral data to argue that the largest families broke up billions of
years ago. However, it was also discovered using dynamical models that some smaller clusters
of objects broke up much more recently: the Karin cluster only 6 million years ago (Nesvorný
et al. 2002) and the Veritas cluster8 million (Nesvorný et al. 2003). In addition to providing con-
straints on regolith processes and impact rates, these young families have been linked to dust
bands seen in IRAS data. Ongoing work seeks to determine the fraction of interplanetary dust
particles (IDPs) falling to Earth from these different sources, as well as from cometary sources.
Reflectance spectroscopy, discussed in more detail in >Sect. 5, has been used to try and
identify “true” families from groups of objects with coincidentally close orbits. Bus (1999) found
families tended to be homogeneous in spectral properties, making the identification of inter-
lopers relatively straightforward, especially in cases where the family is of an unusual spectral
type either when compared to its neighbors in that part of the asteroid belt or in general. Inter-
estingly, astronomers have yet to conclusively find a family of the type that workers in the 1980s
thought would be commonplace (Chapman et al. 1989): a large iron core as the central body
with fragmentsof mantle and crust as the other family members.Burbine et al. (1996) suggested
that the difference in strength between mantle and core (or crust) material would lead to the
rapid collisional erosion of the former.
2.4 Binary and Multiple Objects
The discovery of 243 Ida’s satelliteDactyl by the Galileo spacecraft in 1993 was a surprise (Chap-
man et al. 1995). Surveys in the discovery’s aftermath found ∼2% of large asteroidshad satellites.
This is far less than radar and light curve surveys of NEOs, which find roughly 15% of those
objects are part of multiple systems (Richardson and Walsh 2006). This is thought to reflect dif-
ferent formation styles for large and small objects. The satellite systems of larger asteroids are
thought to form via collisions, either as large fragments of ejecta fortuitously escaping in the
same direction and capturing each other or as ejecta getting captured around the target object
through N-body interactions.
NEO systems are thought to be created through YORP, which is more effective on smaller,
less massive bodies. YORP acts to put a torque on irregular bodies and increases (or decreases)
rotation rates and can move rotation poles (Bottke et al. 2006). For loosely consolidated objects,
increased rotation rate causes material to move to the equator and can eventually cause fission
and creation of a satellite. Studies of 1999 KW4 (Ostro et al. 2006) show the clearest example
of this satellite creation process, which has also been seen in objects like 1994 CC (>Fig. 8-4).
YORP should also be acting on small main-belt asteroids to create satellites, but it has been
difficult to detect such systems. Nevertheless, those data that do exist suggest a binary fraction
more in line with the NEO values than with the large main-belt objects, consistent with YORP
acting on the small MBAs.
Binary systems continue to evolve after formation, and those that are unstable will eventu-
ally give rise to either “contact binaries” where the satellite orbit evolves such that it re-impacts
the primary at low speed or else the orbit can evolve such that the satellite escapes into an inde-
pendent heliocentric orbit. Such asteroid pairs have been found and analyzed by Pravec et al.
(2010) and are seen to be consistent with fission and escape. Cuk (2007) found that a YORP-
like process he called “binary YORP” leads to rapid evolution of the orbits of asteroid binary
systems, suggesting that such systems are quite young in geological terms (<10years) and also

(Figure 11)
⊡Fig. 8-4
The YORP process is thought to create many of the binary systems found with kilometer-scale
primaries. In this process, the YORP torque increases the spin rate of an object, which causes loose
material to move to the equator. At high enough spin rates, ﬁssion can eventually occur with a
satellite forming. This radar-derived shape model of 1994 CC, a small binary system, shows the
characteristics expected for such a process, including a prominent equatorial ridge where material
collects. This shape is commonly seen in small binary systems (Figure from Brozovic et al. (2011))
suggesting that a typical kilometer-sized NEO may go through several cycles of satellite forma-
tion and destruction before it is itself destroyed, with main-belt objects undergoing many cycles
since their formation.
2.5 The NEO Hazard
The resonances that alter NEO orbits and cause them to become planet crossing act quickly.
As mentioned above, a typical NEO only lasts for a few tens of millions of years before it is
removed via impact. In addition, the cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, which measure
the time spent in the main belt or NEO space as a meter-scale object before Earth impact, are
relatively short compared to the age of the solar system (<120Myr for stony meteorites, <1.5 Gyr
for irons: Eugster et al. 2006). As a result, a constant resupply is necessary to explain the popula-
tion seen today. Collisional ejecta is veryunlikelytofind itselfon a resonant orbit. The Yarkovsky
force, however, leads to a steady input of material into resonances far beyond what collisions
can directly input (Bottke et al. 2005). While some objects near resonances may contribute an
increased share of material, the influence of the Yarkovsky force leads to a more well-mixed
NEO population.

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
The recognition that asteroidal impacts play a role in terrestrial extinctions has led to
increased emphasis on understanding the threat from, and trying to avoid, future impacts. This
effort not only involved engineering discussions of mitigation and models of how large impacts
affect the biosphere, not covered here, but also discovery and characterization of NEOs. It was
found that impacts with objects of 1 km are sufficient to have global consequences. Roughly
90% of NEOs 1 km diameter or larger have been discovered according to recent models, with
an extrapolated population of ∼1,000–1,100 such bodies (Stuart and Binzel 2004), though that
number is under regular revision. Discussion of the hazard has led to the concept of “potentially
hazardous asteroids” (PHAs), which can approach within 0.05 AU of the Earth’s orbit and have
absolute magnitudes of 22.0 or brighter, implying sizes of 120–150 m or larger, depending on
assumed albedo. This set of objects is of sufficient size to have at least regional effects and orbits
that can change on the timescale of thousands of years to become Earth-impacting. Actuarial
studies suggest that the largest current threat to Earth, in a statistical sense, is the undiscovered
population of PHAs, rather than any known and cataloged object.
The asteroid 25143 Itokawa is the best-known and best-studied PHA, though it does not
approach closer to the Earth than 2 million km. Other than Itokawa, 99942 Apophis is likely the
most famous PHA, with an upcoming approach to the surface of the Earth of under 40,000 km
in 2029. The only object ever discovered on a collision course with Earth, 2008 TC3, was only
2–3 m in diameter and thus too small to be a PHA or have any serious effect on Earth or its life.
The threat of larger impacts has led to interest both inside and outside the scientific commu-
nity. The US Congress has charged NASA with conducting asteroid surveys, and in addition,
some researchers have studied how best to mitigate any hazards that are found. A variety of
methods have been proposed, depending on the amount of time available before impact and
the size of the impactor. However, the effectiveness of these mitigation techniques is difficult to
confidently forecast without additional information about asteroid interiors in general. Ideally,
detailed information about the physical properties of any impactor would be available prior
to any mitigation is attempted, but effort is being placed into determining average properties,
and the variation of those properties for the NEO population at large in case such mitigation
timescales are short. Beyond the physics of handling a possible impact, the policy and legal
aspects of such a situation are far from settled. While a detailed discussion of these issues
is beyond the scope of this chapter, recent NASA-sponsored studies by the community are
available (NASA’s NEO office hosts links to those studies at http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/links/).
2.6 The Nice Model
In addition to current-day dynamics, recent work has looked at the conditions in the early
solar system. The discovery of “hot Jupiters” around other stars has led to models of plane-
tary migration, where those planets were formed far from their primaries and moved inward
due to scattering of planetesimals. While any single interaction between a planetesimal and a
gas giant has very little effect on the giant planet, the cumulative effect of countless interactions
can rob its orbit of energy and cause the orbit to decay. Models of our own solar system found
that the cumulative effects were to move Jupiter inward (as it scattered planetesimals outward)
but to move Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune outward (as they scattered objects inward). Accord-
ing to the models, Jupiter and Saturn enter resonance with one another after several hundred
million years, with immediate and strong effects on the remaining small body populations as
all four gas giants have rapid orbital changes, resonances sweep the asteroid belt, and Neptune

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8

is thrust out to its current orbit into what was then a Kuiper belt that extended closer to the
Sun. This model, named the “Nice model” after the French city where the first calculations were
made, was published in a set of papers in the first decade of this century (Gomes et al. 2005;
Morbidelli et al. 2005; Tsiganis et al. 2005).
Neptune’s motion into its new orbit is thought to have resulted in a massive shower of KBOs
into the inner solar system. It also may have allowed large numbers of KBOs to be trapped in a
1:1 resonance with Jupiter, resulting in today’s Trojan asteroid population. Furthermore, some
models show that some KBOs can become implanted in the asteroid belt, where they can still
lurk today. The first reconnaissance of KBO spectral properties is still underway, but from the
study of cometary nuclei, it has been suggested that the D-class asteroids (see >Sect. 2), which
is a main spectral type for Trojan asteroids, may be good candidates for implanted KBOs in the
inner solar system. Intriguingly, Phobos and Deimos also have D-class spectra over most or all
of their surfaces. The origin of the Martian moons is still a matter of fierce debate, but an outer
solar system origin is potentially consistent with the Nice model.
This shower of KBOs (and likely, asteroids)mayhave left evidencein the radiometric ages in
meteorites. An apparent peak in impacts near 3.9 billion years ago was noted in lunar samples,
dubbed the “terminal lunar cataclysm” by some lunar researchers, though the evidence remains
controversial (Cohen et al. 2000). Swindle et al. (2009) studied a set of H-chondrite samples
and reviewed other meteorite work, concluding that their argon-argon ages were consistent
with disturbances at roughly 3.9 Gyr ago, interpreted as due to a large impact flux.
3
Geology and Surfaces of Asteroids
The great range of sizes present in the asteroidal population leads to a large range of sur-
face properties. The largest objects are thought to have surfaces like that of the Moon: heavily
cratered and covered in surface layer of regolith. This is borne out by spacecraft visits. The
smaller objects, those only a few tens of meter in size or smaller, are thought to be too small and
easy to disrupt to have experienced much in the way of processing at their current sizes and are
expected to have the properties of similar-sized rocks on Earth. Sullivan et al. (2002) reviewed
our knowledge of asteroidal surface geology at the time between the NEAR and Hayabusa mis-
sions, with the geology of Itokawa presented in a number of papers listed below, and Steins
in Keller et al. (2010). The most recent asteroid encounter that of 21 Lutetia by the Rosetta
spacecraft has not yet been analyzed fully at this writing.
3.1 Cratering
The most pervasive process occurring on asteroids is impact cratering, which continues to this
day. While structures interpreted as craters have been detected on some radar-observed NEOs
(Busch et al. 2008, for instance) and a very large crater has been detected in HST observations
of Vesta (Thomas et al. 1997), the vast majority of our knowledge of asteroidal cratering at this
writing comes from spacecraft imagery of Ida, Gaspra, Eros, Mathilde, and Itokawa.
Crater counts can be used to determine the ages of surfaces, given a knowledge of the
impactor population (or production function), and assuming cratering has not been so intense
as to saturate the surface. Extrapolations from the lunar cratering record can be used, provided

392 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
adjustments are made for the different gravity, composition, and impact speeds experienced by
the asteroids (and indeed, from one asteroid to another).
Chapman et al. (1996a, b) looked at the crater populations of Gaspra and Ida from the
Galileo encounters with those objects, finding Gaspra to have a relatively sparse crater den-
sity and an age ∼200 Myr, while Ida was found to have a surface saturated with craters in the
100 m–1 km size range and an age roughly ten times older than Gaspra. The record on Eros is
similar to that of Ida for craters larger than 100 m, though with a distinct depletion of smaller-
sized craters (Chapman et al. 2002). Eros’ exit from the main-belt population to the NEO
population changed the nature of its impactor population, but this depletion is now ascribed to
erasure via seismic shaking of the regolith during subsequent impacts (see below).
In contrast to these S asteroids, the crater population of the C-asteroid Mathilde is domi-
nated by several very large features, which play a large part in defining Mathilde’s shape. While
Mathilde’s slow rotation hid roughly half of its surface from NEAR Shoemaker during its flyby,
four craters were observed with diameters larger than Mathilde’s radius (Chapman et al. 1999),
which had been generally thought of as the limit beyond which disruption would occur. There
was, however, little evidence these cratering events had large-scale effects on the object. Davis
(1999) showed that these craters and Mathilde’s non-disruption could be explained if Mathilde
was exceedingly porous, a result consistent with its low density. Davis estimated Mathilde’s sur-
face age at roughly 4 billion years old, though uncertainties in the production function and
collisional physics allow an age as young as 2 billion years.
O’Brien et al. (2006) used a model production function created from various astronomi-
cal and meteoritic constraints to fit the crater populations of Gaspra, Ida, Mathilde, and Eros,
including processes responsible for crater degradation and erasure. They found Gaspra to be
best fit by roughly 1 billion years of cratering, with an event roughly 65 Myr ago erasing craters
<3 km, which have been reaccumulating since. Ida’s surface is equally well fit by ages beyond
250 Myr, though they used additional constraints to argue a likely age of 0.5–1 Byr for that
object. For Eros, the best fit age is 120 Myr, while for Mathilde, a 4 Gyr age was found, consistent
with Davis (1999).
Michel et al. (2009) applied the O’Brien et al. production function to Itokawa, finding its
surface age to be at least 75 Myr and possibly as long as 1 Byr. However, there is a pronounced
deficiency of craters 10 m and smaller on Itokawa’s surface, beyond what the seismic shaking
process can explain. Michel et al. noted that models of Itokawa’s structure by Scheeres et al.
(2007) suggest it is a possible contact binary, formed via a low-velocity impact under 1 Myr ago,
and that such an impact could explain the deficiency in small craters. Alternately, armoring of
the surface by Itokawa’s gravely regolith could also play a part by making small crater creation
more difficult, rather than invoking selective erasure.
The most recent asteroid encounter for which full results are available at this writing is the
Rosetta encounterwith the E-class asteroid 2867 Steins (Marchi et al. 2010), which is intermedi-
ate in size between Eros and Itokawa but unlike those objects resides in the main asteroid belt.
As with Itokawa, Marchi et al. found the modeled cratering age of Steins to depend strongly
on model parameters, ranging from 154 Myr for one scaling law to 0.49–1.6 Byr for a differ-
ent scaling law. Another similarity with Itokawa is a lack of small craters, less than ∼500 m on
Steins. This was interpreted as due to erasure and resetting at the time of the largest impact on
Steins (provisionally named Ruby crater). Under that interpretation, the Ruby impact occurred
∼2–10 Myr ago, with smaller craters accumulating since.
Very preliminary results for the July 2010 encounter with 21 Lutetia, also by Rosetta, have
been presented at scientific conferences. While details have not yet been published at the time of

⊡Fig. 8-5
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows the asteroid 2010 A2. Given its cometary appear-
ance, initial speculation centered on it being a volatile-rich object with a sublimation-driven tail.
However, detailed imaging over time showed instead the 3-D structure of the tail and its evolu-
tion much more consistent with dust and debris generated from an impact event on the asteroid.
This is thought to be the ﬁrst time the aftermath of an impact has been seen in the small bodies
population (Image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, reproduced courtesy of NASA)
this writing, the conference abstracts suggest Lutetia has regions of different ages on its surface,
with some “near craterless terrains” suggesting recent impacts (Keller et al. 2010). The same
imagery also has found large craters, with diameters comparable to Lutetia’s radius (up to about
60 km: Marchi et al. 2010).
The recent discovery of the “comet” P/2010 A2 (> Fig. 8-5) has allowed the aftereffects of
an asteroid-asteroid impact in the main belt to be studied. This object had a tail at its discovery
and has been classified as a comet as a result. However, its orbit lies wholly within the inner
asteroid belt, and it was suspected early on of not being a “true” comet (i.e., one whose tail
and coma are generated by sublimation of volatiles). A pair of observing campaigns including
the HST and Rosetta spacecraft allowed a 3-D reconstruction of the tail morphology and led
to the conclusion that P/2010 A2 was the target of a collision in February 2009, less than a
year before its discovery (Snodgrass et al. 2010; Jewitt et al. 2010). Tail evolution was also best
fit when modeled with millimeter- to centimeter-sized particles, rather than the smaller ones
expected from typical cometary dust. It is not yet clear whether this indicates the impact was
not capable of creating smaller particles or if it reflects the typical particle size at the surface of

394 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
P/2010 A2. P/2010 A2 (at ∼120 m) is smaller than any object visited by spacecraft, with Itokawa
the nearest in size. Snodgrass et al. concluded the dust mass represented roughly 16% of the
original parent body mass, and with an initial target size of ∼120 m further concluded that the
impactor was likely ∼6–9 m in diameter. P/2010 A2 is expected to experience impacts of this
size every 1.1 billion years, but such impacts should be occurring every 12 years somewhere in
the asteroid belt.
At this writing, the asteroid 596 Scheila has veryrecentlybeen observed with a tail and coma.
It is not yet clear whether this comet-like activity is dust lofted after an impact, like the inter-
pretation of 2010 A2, or whether it is volatile-driven (perhaps prompted by impact excavation),
similar to what is seen in the main-belt comets.
3.2 Regolith
In addition to cratering, impacts on asteroids serve to pulverize the surface. Because the mean
impact speed in the asteroid belt is roughly 5 km/s, even very small impactors can have an effect:
a 1 mm diameter impactor at that speed carries the same kinetic energy as a typical person
swinging a baseball bat. Over time, a layer of broken up material, the regolith, is left covering
the surface. The regolith in a given location is generated both from smaller impacts breaking
up local rocks and from the ejecta of more distant impacts arriving on ballistic trajectories.
In a quantitative sense, large impacts on the Moon serve to fracture bedrock and deepen the
regolith layer, while smaller impacts further pulverize and mix the regolith (Hartmann 2003).
The lower gravities and irregular shapes found among typical asteroids compared to the Moon
complicate application of lunar models to the asteroids. Dombard et al. (2010) studied NEAR
Shoemaker imagery of boulders on Eros, concluding that some boulders erode in place into
regolith. They proposed that thermal cycling of boulders could cause their disaggregation, with
potential applicability to other asteroids, particularly those with minerals of differing thermal
properties (like the ordinary chondrites, with both metallic and silicate components). Quanti-
tative modeling of regolith formation on asteroids is only in its early stages, hampered by a lack
of data other than Eros and Itokawa (>Fig. 8-6).
What data does exist comes largely from spacecraft imagery. Studies of depth/diameter
ratios of craters compared to theoretical values for newly formed craters suggest that Ida,
Gaspra, and Eros have tens of meters of impact-generated regolith on their surfaces (summa-
rized in Sullivan et al. 2002 and references therein). Similar values are derived by studies of
other geological features. Cheng and Barnouin (2010) suggested that asteroids generateregolith
depths of roughly 0.2% of their diameter, consistent with previous estimates and implying a
regolith depth of ∼200 m for Lutetia and ∼1–2 km for Vesta and Ceres if these objects behave
the same way smaller objects do. These regolith depths can be higher than what is estimated for
the lunar regolith (again, tens of meters: Wilcox et al. 2005), but given the possible differences
in formation, it is again not clear how to best apply lunar constraints to the asteroids.
When dealing with small rubble piles, the situation becomes still murkier. Cheng argued
that Itokawa may have no bedrock at all and could be an accumulation of boulders and
finer material formed on an earlier parent body: effectively regolith the whole way through.
The satellites of smaller asteroids could also be entirely composed of regolith if they formed
via the YORP mechanism as current theories predict (see >Sect. 2), as would be any escaped
satellites now on independent orbits.

of Itokawa has led to a general consensus that it is a rubble pile, a loose collection of boulders
and smaller debris held together by gravity and small-scale cohesion rather than tensile strength
(Image courtesy of JAXA)
The differing thermal properties of bare rock and regolith (and the varying thermal prop-
erties of a dusty regolith versus a cobbly regolith) provide another means of understanding
asteroid surfaces. Delbo’ et al. (2007) showed that thermal models of NEOs as a group were
consistent with an average thermal inertia of ± J m−s−.K−(compared to values
near 10–20 in those same units for the largest main-belt asteroids), which suggests the pres-
ence of regolith rather than bare rock (bare rock thermal inertias are over 1,000 in those units).
However, they also suggested the thermal inertia of asteroids steadily increases with decreasing
size, consistent with increasing particle size with decreasing diameter. Data are relatively sparse,
however, and as objects become smaller, their uncertainties become larger. It is not yet certain
that the thermal inertia does not reach a plateau at ∼10 km and remain at that value for smaller
objects in general.
Impacts into regolith-covered objects have different results depending upon whether or
not the impact is large enough to reach the bedrock at the base of the regolith layer. Large
enough impacts will pulverize bedrock to create more regolith. Small impacts contained entirely
within the regolith layer will serve instead to mix, or garden that layer. In this way, surfaces that

396 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
experience space weathering orsimilarmaturation processes (as discussed below)can be “reset,”
and fresh material brought to the optical surface. Because the porosity of the regolith may differ
from that of the target as a whole, these smaller impacts may also be qualitatively different in
terms of the amount of impact melt produced, ejecta speeds, etc.
3.3 Processes
The surfaces of the asteroids have been exposed to the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts
for billions of years. The extent to which this exposure affects those surfaces has been a mat-
ter of intense debate, although there does appear to be a growing consensus. The term “space
weathering” is often used to describe these processes, or more broadly any process that changes
the surface of an airless body, whether the Moon, Mercury, asteroids, or icy outer solar system
objects.
Studies of the Apollo samples determined lunar soils exhibited a range of correlated prop-
erties: solar wind-derived gasses, metallic iron content, and amount of agglutinitic glasses were
found in greater quantities in soils that spent more time on the lunar surface. A series of papers
at the turn of this century deduced that many of these markers of increased maturity were con-
centrated in the finest particle sizes and were associated with coatings of reduced iron, termed
“nanophase iron” or npFe (Pieters et al. 2000; Noble et al. 2001; Hapke 2001). These coatings
are thought to be due to the reduction of iron in silicates during micrometeorite impacts and its
subsequent deposition from vapor phase on other grains. Sputtering and chemical reduction of
surfaces caused by solar wind interactions has also been invoked as a driver of space weather-
ing, which would act independently of micrometeorite-driven processes (Loeffler et al. 2009).
Destruction of a mature, space-weathered regolith (also called resetting) can also occur, either
through dilution through mixing with fresh, previously buried material during the course of
subsequent impacts, or acceleration off of the object entirely if those subsequent impacts are
sufficiently large (or alternately removal through YORP, see >Sect. 2).
The NEAR Shoemaker mission provided conclusive evidence for space-weathered material
on Eros’ surface (>Fig. 8-7). Low-albedo regolith sits atop high-albedo regolith, and the low-
albedo material can also be found collecting in lower areas after mass wasting.
The amount of space weathering experienced by a given body is likely to be a complex
combination of its collisional and orbital history. This has led to efforts to study the processes
collectively by observing the statistical properties of large samples. These studies will often use
size as a proxy for age: in general, smaller objects will have shorter lifetimes against collisional
disruption than larger objects on equivalent orbits, as discussed in > Sect. 2. They also will
potentially retain a less-developed regolith (due to lower gravity). While a specific 2-km object
may or may not have an older surface than a specific 1-km object, the aggregate population of
2-km objects is expected to have older surfaces than the comparable population of 1-km objects.
Binzel et al. (2004) observed the spectral slopes of the S-complex NEAs (specifically those
falling in the S, Q, or Sq classes) and found the average spectral slope increased from a value
like the OC meteorites for smaller objects (∼1 km diameter and less) to a value typical of the
main-belt S asteroids for objects 5 km diameter and larger.
The timescale on which space weathering acts has been the subject of ongoing research.
The study of very recent families along with some laboratory studies suggests a very rapid
timescale for the process: Vernazza et al. (2009) proposed weathering occurs within 1 Myr,
while Nesvorný et al. (2010a) concluded that the onset occurs at roughly 1 Myr for NEOs, with

⊡Fig. 8-7
This crater on 433 Eros shows evidence of space weathering. Regolith darkens with exposure to
micrometeorites and the solar wind, while material just beneath the surface retains its original
character. This is seen at the left side of the crater, where dark material has moved down the slope
to thecenter, exposingfresher, brighter, and unaltered material (NEAR Shoemaker image, courtesy

a different balance of processes in the main asteroid belt likely leading to a different but roughly
comparable timescale. The short dynamical lifetime of the NEAs and the common presence of
apparently weathered S asteroids in that population seem to require a timescale shorter than
10 Myr. However, there is evidence for another much longer-acting weathering process as well.
The multifamily study of Willman and Jedicke (2011) led to an estimate of ∼2,050 Myr for the
weathering timescale, roughly consistent with the work of Grier et al. (2001) who found lunar
materials did not fully weather until roughly 1 Gyr. Vernazza et al. (2009) also found evidence
for a second, slower process along with a faster process.
The presence of OH/HO in the lunar regolith (Pieters et al. 2009; Sunshine et al. 2009; Clark
2009) has been attributed to the interaction of solar wind protons with the lunar surface in a
form of space weathering. While still a very recent result, the implications for asteroidal regolith
are obvious. Taken at the simplest level, the asteroids should be more susceptible to solar wind-
created OH/HO than the Moon since they are colder and have had ample time to more than
make up for their greater distance from the Sun. However, a more detailed look suggests a more
complicated picture: objects are commonly found lacking the deep absorption bands seen on
the Moon, including on relatively lunar-like objects like Vesta (Rivkin et al. 2006). NEOs like
Eros and Toutatis are also lacking the bands in available data (Rivkin and Clark 2001; Howell
et al. 1994). Further work will likely clarify the extent to which the processes seen on the Moon
are acting on the asteroids and why differences may exist.

3.4 Regolith Movement and Mass Wasting
Mass movement occurs on asteroidal surfaces via several processes, which serve to soften
(or erase)craters and move material from high to low elevations. Although not typically consid-
ered in this category, the accumulation of impact ejecta is one such process. The low gravities of
the asteroids visited by spacecraft are not conducive to the formation of continuous and discon-
tinuous ejecta blankets, as is seen on the Moon, but models have shown that ejecta and boulders
from impacts can have a blanketing effect far from the impact point (Geissler et al. 1996).
Two similar effects, jolt and seismic shaking, are thought to be responsible for the majority
of mass movement on larger asteroids. Jolt is due to seismic waves from a large impact globally
destabilizing slopes and moving mass (Nolan et al. 2001). Seismic shaking is a smaller-scale
process, which when integrated over long timescales and over an entire object leads to similar
results as jolt. Thomas and Robinson (2005) concluded the formation of a single 7.6 km crater
on Eros was responsible for the removal of 500-m craters over nearly 40% of its surface via
seismic “degradation of topography.” Richardson et al. (2005) demonstrated that the collisional
evolution of an Eros-like object, including the effects of seismic shaking, resulted in a good
fit to the Eros crater size-frequency distribution. They found that depending on the seismic
propagation properties, impactors as small as a few meters or less could potentially destabilize
all of the slopes on an Eros-sized object. Conversely, they predict that there is an upper limit
to the size of affected bodies, and objects larger than ∼70–100 km will not experience global
effects from a single impact. This size is roughly the size of Lutetia, which should provide an
interesting constraint for seismic shaking models.
More recently, it has been realized that the YORP force, in addition to affecting the direc-
tion of asteroid spin vectors, can also play a role in regolith transport. In cases where YORP
increases spin rate, a potential gradient is created from pole to equator, preferentially causing
regolith to move to lower latitudes. As the process continues, material may be lifted from the
surface to create a satellite (see >Sect. 2). Evidence for this has been seen on two objects, 1999
KW4 (diameter ∼1.2 km) and 1996 RQ36 (diameter ∼560 m), both seen through radar-derived
shape models to have dramatic equatorial belts consistent with YORP-driven regolith move-
ment (Ostro et al. 2006; Nolan et al. 2007). Although data are still scarce, it seems possible
that the shape of KW4 will come to be understood as a typical shape for asteroids in its size
range.
The rapid weathering timescale seen by Vernazza et al. and other workers suggests that
NEO surfaces should be fully weathered through most of their lifetimes in near-Earth space.
The relatively large fraction of Q-class asteroids in the NEO population requires a means of
“resetting” their surfaces to explain the fresh material seen spectroscopically. A series of papers
looked at the distribution of orbits for S- and Q-class NEOs, interpreted as fresh and mature
surfaces, reaching the conclusion that tidal forces during close passes to the Earth and/or Venus
are responsible for the resetting (Binzel et al. 2010; Nesvorný et al. 2010a). This could be seen
as similar to comet disruptions during close passes to Jupiter or the Sun (Asphaug and Benz
1996), but obviously much less energetic than those cases. The close pass of Apophis to Earth in
2036 has been suggested as a test case for theories of tidal resetting of regolith (Holsapple and
Michel 2006).
The most striking and unexpected surface features seen on Eros were the so-called
ponds: smooth areas apparently composed of fine-grained material, or at least free of larger
cobbles and rocks typically seen elsewhere on the body (see >Fig. 8-8, Robinson et al. 2001;

Regolith on Eros is seen close-up in these four panels. The two left panels show the phenomenon
knownas“ponds,”verysmoothareaswhereﬁne-grainedregolithcollects.Itisnotyetclearwhether
this is primarily due to eﬀects like seismic shaking, electrostatic levitation, or a combination of
those and other processes (NEAR Shoemaker image, courtesy of JHU/APL and NASA)
Sullivan et al. 2002). Often, ponds were seen on crater floors. These deposits, including NEAR
Shoemaker’s landing spot, are mostly found near the equator (over 90% of larger ponds are
within 30○of the equator), which also include regions with relatively low gravity and areas that
are preferentially near the terminator due to Eros’ very high obliquity. In addition to images of
ponds available from orbit and NEAR Shoemaker’s landing sequence, spectral data shows the
ponds to be less red and have a deeper silicate absorption band than non-pond regions on Eros,
suggesting pond material is less altered than the typical background material.
Pond-like morphology can also be seen on Itokawa, despite its small size. Fujiwara et al.
(2006) divided Itokawa into “rough” and “smooth” terrain and noted the similarity between
the latter and ponds on Eros in low-resolution imagery, though the particle size in the Itokawa
smooth terrain is coarser than what is expected in the ponds on Eros. Barnouin-Jha et al. (2008)
concluded that the smooth terrain on Itokawa (which they called the “lowlands”) is flatter than
any area on Eros except for perhaps its ponds and also noted that at least 1 pond could be seen
on a crater floor on Itokawa, echoing what is seen on Eros.

400 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
Two theories have been invoked for explaining these ponds. The first is electrostatic levi-
tation. Regolith illuminated by sunlight will become charged via the photoelectric effect, with
solar wind electron flux providing a competing effect. If the electrostatic repulsion force exceeds
the gravitational force, the charged regolith may levitate and follow field lines to other parts of
the body or else escape entirely. Scheeres et al. (2010, following Colwell et al. 2005) calculated
asteroids at a variety of solar distances would obtain a surface potential of 4.4 V near the subso-
lar point, thought to be insufficient for motion of even the smallest regolith particles. However,
near-terminator regions may have a greatly enhanced electric field, and scaling from lunar mod-
els suggests particles up to centimeter in size could be transported on an Itokawa-sized object.
Hughes et al. (2008) modeled dust levitation on Eros and found it provided a plausible scenario
for pond formation there, although they were unable to explain their geographic distribution
and considered the model incomplete.
Seismic shaking has also been proposed as the explanation for the ponds, as well as for the
lack of small craters. In this case, mobilized regolith would collect at low areas on an asteroidal
surface, and additional impacts would serve to further add to the pond (Cheng et al. 2002).
3.5 Outgassing
The asteroid belt is thought to be near the position of the “snow line” or “ice line”: the distance in
the solar nebula at which local conditions allowed the condensation and accretion of water ice
into solid bodies. There is ample evidence from the meteorite collection that water was impor-
tant in the evolution of at least some carbonaceous chondrites, and as is discussed in >Sect. 4,
there is evidence for surviving reservoirs of internal ice in Ceres and other objects.
However, the surface temperatures experienced today for most main-belt asteroids are gen-
erally too high to allow ice to remain stably across their surfaces. Schorghofer (2008) modeled
the temperature distribution for asteroids as a function of rotation rate, obliquity, semimajor
axis, and thermal inertia, finding that beyond roughly 3.1–3.2 AU ice could remain stable in
the shallow subsurface at low latitudes for realistic asteroidal objects, where it could plausibly
be liberated byimpacts. This modeling is consistent with the observations of“main-belt comets,”
(MBCs) whose activity is thought to be driven by sublimation of ice newly excavated from their
interiors. As sublimation continues, an ice-free lag deposit forms, like what is found on typical
comets, and eventually, ice availability and activity ceases.
It is not known whether outgassing is occurring today on objects other than the MBCs.
Observations of Ceres by A’Hearn and Feldman (1992) found evidence of OH emission from
its sunlit pole, with none from the pole in darkness. Ceres shows no evidence of ice in spectra
of its surface, and it is too warm to retain ice in its near-surface save very close to its poles.
However, the possibility that Ceres’ surface is a relatively thin lag deposit over relatively pure
ice (Rivkin et al. 2011b) provides reasonably easy resupply of ice to the surface, and while the
A’Hearn and Feldman observations have not been confirmed, the possibility remains that Ceres
hosts a local outgassing-induced atmosphere near its summer pole.
3.6 Cohesive Forces
It has recently been recognized that the cohesive forces that act between particles in the micro-
gravity conditions found on the surfaces of small asteroids can be much stronger than seen in
more familiar conditions (Asphaug 2008; Scheeres et al. 2010). Scheeres et al. (2010) compared

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8

the importance of several forces experienced by asteroidal regolith, including electrostatic,
solar radiation, and surface cohesive forces. They found that for objects the size and gravity of
Itokawa, van der Waals cohesive forces dominate over other forces, including gravity. They pro-
pose that clumping of small particles could mimic larger particles, for instance, what appears
to be centimeter-sized gravel on Itokawa could instead be centimeter-sized clumps of much
finer particles. This leads to the possibility that some properties seen on asteroidal surfaces
and attributed to strength, such as cliffs or ability to withstand rapid rotation, may instead be
consistent with cohesion in a rubble pile of centimeter-sized or smaller particles.

Asteroidal Interiors and Geophysics
The study of asteroidal interiors is still in its infancy, though it has made great strides in the
past decade. Values for asteroidal masses and densities are still scarce, but becoming more com-
mon through precise astrometry and discoveries of binary objects. Furthermore, a precise shape
model has helped constrain the interiorofCeres, with applications tootherobjects likelytosoon
follow.
4.1 Asteroid Sizes and Densities
Knowing an object’s density provides a relatively easy qualitative insight into its interior
structure. Determining the densities for asteroids has been challenging, however, and well-
constrained densities are only available for a relative handful of objects. Indeed, for the vast
majority of objects, even the size is poorly constrained, with only a brightness available. As a
result, the absolute magnitude (H) of asteroids is often reported in place of a size. The H magni-
tude represents the brightness of an asteroid if it were at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun, 1 AU
from the Earth, and at 0○phase angle. While that geometry is impossible to attain in reality,
the H magnitude can be calculated from observations at other geometries. The diameter (D) of
an asteroid is related to the absolute magnitude through the albedo (p), or fraction of incident
light reflected from the surface:
D = , (p−/)−.H
Albedos are best measured by simultaneous observations of emitted and reflected flux, although
often these must be measured separately due to instrumental limitations. Harris and Lagerros
(2002) review thermal models for asteroids.
If no albedo information is available or inferable, the range of typical albedos for asteroids
(∼0.04–0.4) leads to an uncertainty of a factor of ∼3 in size, leading to a factor of ∼27 uncertainty
in volume. Reducing the albedo uncertainty to a factor of 2 (by constraining a spectral type or
by other means) reduces the size uncertainty to a factor of 50%, reducing the volume uncer-
tainty accordingly. A measurementof size via albedo measurement,occultation, direct imaging
(via AO or spaceborne techniques), or otherwise leads to much improved volume estimates, and
typically volumes are much more well-constrained for asteroids than mass. However, precise
volume estimates are very much dependent upon good shape models, which require extended
light-curve campaigns or close enough passes for radar experiments if objects are not large
enough to be directly imaged. Spacecraft flybys can reverse the typical situation, providing a
secure mass but leaving the volume relativelyless well-constrained, particularlyforslow rotators

or objects observed near a solstice, where a large fraction of the object may remain in shadow
through the spacecraft observing period.
Masses can be quite difficult to obtain for all but the largest asteroids, which themselves
have only been given precise masses relatively recently. Most of the mass of the asteroid belt is
concentrated in a very small number of bodies, with Ceres alone accounting for roughly one-
third of its mass. Nearer the small end, the meter-scale bodies that are the proximate parent
bodies of most meteorites are no more massive than large cars or light trucks. Itokawa, visited
by the Hayabusa spacecraft, is of roughly the same mass as the Three Gorges Dam in China, the
most massive human-made object.
The most accurate asteroidal masses are those made during spacecraft rendezvous, like
Hayabusa’s with Itokawa and NEAR Shoemaker’s with Eros. These missions were successful in
measuring object masses to 1–3% via spacecraft tracking (Yeomans et al. 2000; Abe et al. 2006),
and Dawn is expected to provide yet more precise mass measurements for Ceres and Vesta. It
has proven more difficult to measure masses during flybys, particularly when the encounters
occur as “add-ons” to missions with a non-asteroidal focus and cannot be optimized for aster-
oidal science. Even in these cases, however, the constraints that can be placed on target mass
(∼±15–20% for the Galileo flyby of Ida: Petit et al. 1997) are better than could be generated by
other means.
Ida, as a binary, provided another means of mass measurement. The ability to determine
system masses relatively easily for binary systems (and the importance of mass measurements)
has been a major driver for binary search programs. Roughly 50 asteroids have been confirmed
to have satellites, and the data suggests that satellitesare probable for roughly 50 more (Richard-
son and Walsh 2006; Johnston 2012). However, fewer than half of the confirmed systems have
been observed well enough to calculate their mass. In some cases, particularly NEO systems,
the recurrence time between good apparitions is very long, hampering efforts to determine
their mass. The preponderance of singleton asteroids also limits the usefulness of this technique.
However, it remains the most promising avenue forgenerating high-qualitymass measurements
for the largest number of targets.
The final technique for measuring asteroid masses is through observations of close encoun-
ters between objects or the masses necessary to account for orbital perturbations for a pop-
ulation. This method requires very precise astrometric measurements, particularly as objects
become smaller. Roughly two dozen asteroids have had their masses measured by this tech-
nique, including Ceres and Vesta. Precision measurementsof the position of Mars by spacecraft
in its orbit are sensitive to effects of asteroids that are both more massive and/or pass rela-
tively close to Mars, and masses of those objects have also become available (Fienga et al. 2009;
Konopliv et al. 2011). While anticipated data from Dawn will improve our knowledge of the
masses of Ceres and Vesta, this type of astrometric technique will likely remain the best hope
for constraining the mass of Pallas and other large single asteroids (Hilton 2002).
Studies of meteorite densities were greatly spurred by the first spacecraft encounters with
asteroids during the 1990s, with a nondestructive technique developed using helium to accu-
rately measure the cracks and voids present in a sample (Consolmagno et al. 2008). Densities
among the meteorites range from roughly 2,000–8,000 kg/m, with the CI chondrites on the
low end and iron meteorites at the high end of that range, and the most important controlling
factors for the meteorite densities are fractions of low-density hydrated minerals and of iron
metal, as one might expect. However, before these densities can be compared to asteroidal
values, the additional factor of porosity must be taken into account.

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
403
Porosity occurs in two forms: the intrinsic porosity found between grains in a coherent
rock (for instance, the interior cracks and voids mentioned above) called microporosity and
larger-scale porosity between rocks due to voids or joints called macroporosity. For comparison,
the porosity in a pile of sand is roughly 40% (Abe et al. 2006), and the porosity of a coherent
slab of granite can be less than 1% (Nur and Simmons 1969). Some very low densities among
asteroidal bodies, notablyPhobos, Deimos, 253 Mathilde, and 45 Eugenia, can only be explained
by significant macroporosity (30–50% or higher) or very large amounts of interior ice, which
are geochemically unlikely.
While the low density of C asteroids and the general acceptance of the link between them
and carbonaceous chondrites makes the argument for macroporosity fairly clear, the densities
of other asteroids can be more difficult to interpret due to less well-defined linkages and more
intermediate densities. The density of 243 Ida, with no other information, can be interpreted as a
low-porosityordinarychondrite oras a higher-porositystonyiron. Similarly, the interpretations
of the internal structures of Eros, Ida, and Itokawa are influenced by the general consensus
that these are ordinary chondrite-like bodies and that deviations from typical OC densities are
indicative of varying amounts of macroporosity (>Fig. 8-9).

4.2 Monoliths and Rubble Piles
There has been no universally accepted consensus on the terminology to be used for asteroid
interiors. However, Asphaug et al. (2002) suggested “monolith” for coherent objects, “shattered”
forobjects that are thoroughlyfaulted and jointed but whose interiorpieces have not appreciably
moved or rotated with respect to one another, and “rubble pile” for those objects composed of
pieces that have moved and/orrotated. Rubble piles can alsobe generated bythe reaccumulation
of material after a catastrophic disruption. Stress waves propagate much more poorly in rubble
piles than monoliths, leading to different results upon impact, as described below. The lack of
a firm consensus on terminology leads some to consider any object to be either monolith or
rubble pile, with no third category.
The masses and gravities of asteroids do not generate large central pressures, important for
considering phase changes and mechanical properties in asteroidal interiors. The most massive
body in the asteroid belt, Ceres, has a central pressure of only 1.5–2 kbar, still appreciably larger
than that of Vesta (roughly 500–700 bars). Smaller objects like Mathilde have central pressures
less than 5 bars, with Phobos size and smaller objects under 1 bar. For comparison, the central
pressure in the Earth is roughly 3.6 Mbar, over 1,000 times that of Ceres.
Asphaug et al. (2002) considered these central pressures by calculating the equivalent depth
of burial here on Earth where the same pressures are found. For the largest asteroids, this is on
the order of kilometers, while for objects of sizes like those visited by spacecraft, the equiva-
lent depth is ∼10 m or less (in some cases, like Itokawa, much less, of order 1 mm, though of
course porosity in the uppermost portions of the Earth’s surface means there is much more
pressure from the ambient atmosphere than overlying rock). These central pressures, even for
the largest asteroids, are much smaller than the pressures required to remove all of the porosity
from chondritic material, and therefore the density of undifferentiated objects is expected to be
a lower bound on the allowable density of any meteorite analogs.
Consolmagno et al. (2008) compiled the available densities of asteroids and, comparing
them to the microporosities of potential analog meteorites, extracted estimates of the macro-
porosity present in those bodies. They reported that those asteroids with masses larger than
10kg have macroporosities consistent with zero. These include the three most massive aster-
oids (Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta). The mass of Hygiea is slightly below the 10kg threshold, but
its density (2.55 g/cm) and likely carbonaceous chondrite-like composition makes a lack of
significant macroporosity also consistent for that body. There may be additional objects with
masses similar to Hygiea that also have little or no macroporosity, but the relatively few aster-
oids with well-constrained massesprevents a more thorough census at this point. Consolmagno
et al. suggest the low (or absent) macroporosities of the largest asteroids could be due to avoid-
ance of catastrophic collisions and reaccretion or gravitational removal of macroporosity via
interior pressure, though that is unlikely as seen above. However, objects can potentially reduce
their porosities via differentiation, which we suspect has occurred in Vesta and Ceres, and could
plausibly also have occurred in Hygiea and Pallas.
In contrast to the larger objects, Consolmagno et al. found that “virtually all” objects smaller
than 10kg have at least 20% macroporosity if not much larger values. Some larger objects
can sustain surprisingly large macroporosities, like the ∼50% macroporosity inferred for 45
Eugenia (∼200 km diameter), ∼45% forthe components ofthe 90 Antiope system (each ∼100km
diameter), and an astonishingly high ∼60% macroporosity for the 150-km object 283 Emma.
When separating the objects by spectral class, they also find that the smaller macroporosity
values are preferentially found in the S-class asteroids, with the C-class objects carrying larger

macroporosities in general. Abe et al. (2006) reported a porosity of ∼40% for Itokawa, similar
to a pile of angular sand, and interpreted as evidence of a rubble pile structure. Given the 40%+
porosities seen in rocky bodies over the entire 200 m–200 km size range (if not beyond in either
direction), it seems safe to say that rubble piles are the typical state of affairs for asteroids.
4.3 Rotation Rates and Interior Structure
Reliable rotation rates are known for over 3,000 asteroids (Warner et al. 2009) and also provide
information about asteroid interiors. Harris (1996) considered the balance of centrifugal force
and gravity, specifically the equation
ρc = (./P)(+ Δm)
where ρc is the critical density at which an object would fly apart for a period of P hours and a
light-curve amplitude of Δm magnitudes (for a spherical object, Δm = ). For a sample of 688
asteroids, Harris found ρc = .g/cmwas consistent with the distribution of periods, consis-
tent with the idea that all of the objects in the sample were rubble piles with no tensile strength.
The larger database now available still shows evidence of the so-called spin barrier, where no
large objects have rotation periods less than roughly 2.2 h (>Fig. 8-10). Conversely, below a size
⊡Fig. 8-10
This ﬁgure, originally published by Warner et al. (2009), shows known rotational periods for aster-
oids compared to their sizes. Objects larger than ∼150 m have periods longer than roughly 2 h,
the so-called spin barrier that is suggestive that these objects are rubble piles, or at least that ten-
sile strength is not required for those bodies. Below ∼150 m, rotation periods can be much faster,
but it is not clear whether tensile strength is necessary to explain them or if cohesive forces in a
low-gravity environment alone are suﬃcient

406 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
of roughly 200 m, rapid rotators become very common, including some with periods as short
as a few minutes.
While these results are very suggestive that the rapid rotators can be single intact rocks (or
“monoliths”), there are additional factors that complicate matters. An object seen to have slow
rotation is not proven to be a rubble pile, although the weight of numbers is, again, suggestive.
More seriously, calculations including cohesion (Holsapple 2007) indicate that smaller objects
could have rotation periods far shorter than the spin barrier but still be rubble piles. Cohesive
forces on asteroid surfaces are further discussed in >Sect. 3.
4.4 Strength
The response of an object (asteroidal or otherwise) to stresses like impacts and disruption is
critically dependent upon its strength. The greater gravitational binding energy of large objects
leads to increasing strength as size increases. Laboratory experiments have probed small sizes
(of order metersize and smaller) and find that strength in that size region increases with smaller
size, as there is less likelihood of smaller objects having a crack or flaw that aligns with the
direction of stress (Durda et al. 1998). This leads to behaviorwhere the strength (here defined as
energy per unit mass required for disruption), called Q*, first decreases with object sizes before
reaching a minimum value, then increasing again. Objects larger than the minimum Q* are
considered to be in the “gravity regime,” where effects are relatively independentof composition
while those below the minimum are in the “strength regime,” where material properties and
composition play a leading role. Material properties should have an important influence on the
asteroidal size-frequency distribution.
Determining the transition between strength and gravity regimes has been a matter of con-
tinuing work, though it appears to be roughly near 100 m in size. At this writing, there are no
firm plans for spacecraft visits to objects suspected to be in the strength regime, though one
may be visited by astronauts in the mid-2020s.
4.5 Meteoritical Data
Some direct information about asteroidal interiors can be obtained from meteorite samples,
many of which came from differentiated bodies (see > Sects. 3 and > 5). It is thought the
main heat source driving differentiation was decay of short-lived radionuclides, mainly Al
(Grimm and McSween 1993). Other heat sources may have contributed, however. Magnetic
induction heating, in which the changing magnetic fields in the solar nebula led to Joule heating
of materials, has also been investigated and is considered a possible contributor. Accretional
energy and energy brought via larger impacts may also have played a role, though such energy
is deposited near an object’s surface and is more readily radiated away. McCoy et al. (2006)
includes a review of possible processes.
The asteroids began as undifferentiated, unequilibrated mixtures of material stable at main-
belt temperatures: rock-forming minerals, metal, and in some cases ice. As interior temper-
atures increased in (some) asteroidal parent bodies, the differing melting temperatures and
densities of these components led to differentiation into rocky mantles and crusts over metallic
cores, or in some water-rich bodies like Ceres an icy mantle over a rock-metal core.

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
407
Roughly a dozen iron meteorite groups show evidence of having formed in the core of a
differentiated object, which would also have had a rocky mantle. There are over 80 ungrouped
iron meteorites, from which parent body data is difficult to extract, but some estimates suggest
that as many as 60 objects may have differentiated into a core, mantle, and crust in the early
asteroid belt (Chabot and Haack 2006). Many of the achondrite groups may also have come
from differentiated objects. The HED meteorites have been linked to Vesta, generally thought
to be a differentiated object, but the HEDs appear to harbor at least two distinct parent bodies,
suggesting a second Vesta-like object once was in existence. Gaffey et al. (1993) summarized the
general properties of fully differentiated objects, with core radii 40–50%, mantle thicknesses of
30–45%, and crusts ∼20% of the total radius for OC compositions (H chondrites having the
largest cores and thinnest mantles, with the opposite for LL chondrites). This provides a rough
rule of thumb that any existing meteorite parent bodies that were cores of differentiated bodies
require disruption of an object at least twice the current parent body size.
Partially differentiated objects may also exist. While the gravity of larger objects is too large
to maintain significant density inversions in layers of rock and metal, in smaller objects, the
inherent material strength of the layers may be sufficient to maintain relatively small forces
from overlying (or underlying buoyant) layers, especially at colder temperatures or relatively
small amounts of melting.
Modeling of Vesta’s interior using both meteoritical and astronomical evidence is sum-
marized in Keil (2002) and McCoy et al. (2006). Mass balance arguments by Ruzicka et al.
(1997) suggest Vesta’s core is most likely near 5 wt% of the body’s entire mass, though with
large uncertainties. They further suggest an upper limit of 130 km for core radius, a ∼65–220 km
thick mantle, and overlying diogenite and eucrite layers of ∼12–43 and ∼23–42 km thicknesses,
respectively. An independent calculation by Dreibus et al. (1997) based on Vesta’s bulk silicates
leads to a larger estimated core mass of 21.7%, with a radius of 123 km. These values lead to
a good match with the measured density of Vesta for reasonable estimates of mantle and core
densities.
It is clear from the HED meteorites that differentiation and melting on Vesta occurred very
early in solar system history, within its first few million years. This is also the timescale on which
Vesta’s basaltic crust was formed, with the crust forming after core separation and volcanism
lasting for at least 10 million years or so (McSween et al. 2010 and references therein). Study of
the sizes of “vestoids,” asteroids dynamically and spectrally related to Vesta, leads to an estimate
that its crust is greater than roughly 10 km in thickness, consistent with calculations based on
the cooling rates of eucrites and the mass balance studies mentioned above. The geochemical
details of the HED meteorites also are consistent with a magma ocean phase on Vesta, although
consensus has not yet been reached. It is also not clear what Vesta’s undifferentiated composition
was most like, with different lines of evidence supporting ordinary chondritic, carbonaceous
chondritic, and nonchondritic precursors (McSween et al. 2010).
The interior structure of Ceres has been the subject of several recent studies. McCord and
Sotin (2005) argued that Ceres was sufficiently large that its macroporosity should be near zero
and that its density should represent the density of its starting materials. They modeled several
cases fitting that constraint and found a model of an icy mantle over a rocky core to be the
most likely case. This was independently borne out by analysis of HST data by Thomas et al.
(2005), who used improved shape information for Ceres to argue for the same interior structure.
Castillo-Rogez and McCord (2010) found that depending upon initial conditions, liquid water
may remain in Ceres’ deep interior to the present. Ceres is differentiated into a rocky core and
a volatile shell in all cases considered by Castillo-Rogez and McCord. They also found that the

408 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
shape of Ceres is very sensitive to the amount of hydrated silicates present in the core, though
measurements of Ceres’ shape is not of sufficient precision for further constraints. The Castillo-
Rogez and McCord models do allow for the differentiation not only of ice from rock but of an
iron core, though the most likely cases do not differentiate to that extent.
In contrast to the geophysical models, Zolotov (2009) has argued that many of Ceres’ prop-
erties are also consistent with a porous, undifferentiated body made of hydrated minerals.
However, such a composition and structure cannot explain Ceres’ shape as seen by Thomas
et al. The Dawn encounter with Ceres in 2015 should provide data to further constrain models
of Ceres’ interior.
These types of thermal models are also being turned to other large asteroids. Castillo-Rogez
and Schmidt (2010) modeled the original parent body of the Themis family, with starting con-
ditions varying composition and the time of formation. They find that for starting compositions
of homogeneous ice/rock mixtures, rapid formation (∼3 Myr after CAI formation) leads to dif-
ferentiation of the parent body similar to what is seen in the models of Ceres. Longer formation
times (5 Myr) lead to only partial differentiation or for a homogeneous 100% hydrated silicate
composition, with no geophysical evolution at all. They suggest that astronomical observations
of 24 Themis and 90 Antiope, the two largest members of the current Themis family, could
be explained by a differentiated or partially differentiated case, where Themis and Antiope
reaccreted a large fraction of ice after parent-body disruption.
Interior models of chondritic parent bodies are constrained largely from meteoritic rather
than astronomical evidence.Uncertainties are further compounded by the unknown numberof
parent bodies represented by the meteorites: while it is generally considered that each of the OC
groups (H, L, LL, etc.) comes from a different parent body, it is still not known whether more
than one parent body could contribute to each class. Conversely, some of the carbonaceous
chondrite classes may have originated on the same parent body, experiencing different levels of
alteration, and some of the achondrite groups are associated with one another (e.g., winonaites
and IAB irons, for example: Weisberg et al. 2006).
The differing metamorphic grades of OC meteorites and the various temperatures required
to cause the observed metamorphism have led to a general conception of an “onion skin” model
for the interiors of OC parents (or at least their predisruption interiors, as appropriate). In this
model, the highest temperatures and highest metamorphic grades are found at the center of the
parent body, with both decreasing with decreasing depth. The unequilibrated (type 3) chon-
drites would be found near the surface. However, differing peak temperatures and cooling rates
are implied by different techniques, complicating detailed modeling (Huss et al. 2006). Besides
these direct constraints, factors such as the depth of regolith and megaregolith (and its time
history) and the time and pattern of parent body accretion also can have significant influence
on the interior temperature and evolution of asteroids (Ghosh et al. 2003).
Differentiation and formation of iron cores is at least superficially straightforward. Chabot
and Haack (2006) review geochemical studies of the iron meteorites, with their cooling rates
suggesting original parent-body diameters on 10–100 km scales. Unlike the formation of the
Earth’s core, asteroidal cores most likely formed via dendritic growth downward from the core-
mantle boundary. However, other possible modes of crystallization cannot currently be ruled
out. Because of the small sizes of asteroids, any liquid cores must have solidified very early in
solar system history, perhaps within the first few million years (Roberts et al. 2011).
Liberation of iron meteorites from asteroidal interiors is, however, proving to be more dif-
ficult than originally envisioned. Collisional models suggest that disruption of asteroids and
dispersal of fragments is exceedingly difficult today. Furthermore, the survival of only a single

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
409
Vesta-like object in the asteroid belt is consistent with few having ever been present, even in
early solar system history (Bottke et al. 2005). It is not currently obvious how best to recon-
cile these constraints, though Bottke et al. (2006) argued that the data are consistent with iron
meteorites forming in parent bodies’ interior to today’s asteroid belt, being liberated during dis-
ruptions, and experiencing dynamical evolution to reach their current orbits all during the first
few 10years of solar system history.
Despite the lack of liquid cores today, and the narrow window during which meteorite par-
ent bodies could have sustained a magnetic field, remnant magnetism can be found in some
meteorites. Weiss et al. (2010) review the field of meteorite paleomagnetic studies.

Asteroid and Meteorite Compositions
Our knowledge of the asteroids is immeasurably enhanced by the meteorite collection. The
combination of impacts in the asteroid belt and orbital evolution due to the Yarkovsky force
and planetary resonances leads to a constant influx of asteroidal material to the Earth. Roughly
, ± , kg of meteorites fall to the Earth in a typical year (Bland et al. 1996; Zolensky
et al. 2006), although due to the fraction of the Earth’s surface covered by the oceans and other
inaccessible areas, most are not recovered. However, meteorites can be recognized decades or
longer after their fall because of distinctive features such as their fusion crust (a thin surficial
layer caused by frictional heating during atmospheric passage) and high metal fraction com-
pared to terrestrial rocks. In addition, some terrains and climates result in concentration of
and/or easier recognition of meteorites, for instance, the Sahara desert and regions of Antarc-
tica. Indeed, most of the known meteorites were recovered in Antarctica by dedicated search
teams like ANSMET. Meteorites collected long after their fall, or with no knowledge of their
fall date, like the Antarctic meteorites, are termed “finds,” while those seen to fall and collected
soon after are called “falls.” Falls are considered more valuable to the community than finds
since they have less terrestrial alteration and contamination, but often for rare meteorite types,
only finds are available.
Meteorites are formally classified into different groups based on their compositions, tex-
tures, and alteration histories as shown in > Fig. 8-11. At the highest level, meteorites are
typically divided into the chondrites and achondrites.
Chondrites have elemental abundances in the same relative concentrations seen in the Sun,
save for those elementsthat are not easily incorporated into rocks such as hydrogen and helium.
These “chondritic abundances” are evidence that these materials are largely unprocessed since
formation. Chondrites also are distinguished by chondrules, millimeter-scale glassy spherules
or fragments of spherules. Chondrules formed within 2–3 million years of the condensation of
the first solar system solids (typically considered the “time zero” for the solar system), melting
and recrystallizing as free-floating objects within the solar nebula before being incorporated
into the chondrites (Morris and Desch 2010). When discussing chondrites, a distinction is
usually made between the chondrules and the “matrix,” comprising the material in the rock
found between chondrules. Chondrules can comprise up to 80% of the volume of some chon-
drite types. Despite their importance, determining the process by which chondrules formed
has been a long-standing problem in meteoritics. Early suggestions that they melted via neb-
ular lightning, solar flares, and impacts have been replaced by preference for models in which

410 8

The meteorites are typically divided into the achondrites, which have experienced some form of
melting, and the chondrites which have not. This ﬁgure, from Weisberg et al. (2006), includes
a distinction between those achondrites that have experienced melting and diﬀerentiation
from those that have only experienced a small amount of melting (the primitive achondrites).
These large-scale distinctions are further subdivided into the groups and classes discussed in the
text
the chondrule precursor material melted after passing through shock waves in the solar nebula
(Morris and Desch 2010).
Chondrites are thought to represent the starting material for rocky bodies and the rock-
ier portion of icy bodies. This gives an important constraint for chemical evolution models,
for instance, allowing the composition of the Earth’s core (or the lunar or Martian core) to be
calculated from the near-surface samples available to us. They also provide textural and compo-
sitional information directly related to early solar system history. The calcium-aluminum-rich
inclusions (CAIs)present in manychondrites are the oldest solids in the solarsystem, comprised
of refractory material that was the first to condense out of the solar nebula.
The chondrites are further divided into several groups and subgroups based on details of
elemental patterns and isotopic ratios. The largest group is the ordinary chondrites (OCs),
responsible for the vast majority of falls (roughly 90% of chondrites and 80% of all meteorites)
and presumably comprising the majority of asteroidal material, at least in near-Earth space. The
OCs are primarily composed of olivine and pyroxene, with plagioclase, other silicates, iron-
nickel metal, sulfides, and oxides in smaller proportions (Rubin 1996). Typically, they contain
less matrix than the carbonaceous chondrites, the other major chondrite grouping. The abun-
dance of iron and its fraction in metallic versus oxidized forms leads to a further division in the
OCs between the H (high), L (low), and LL (very low) groups.

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
411
The carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) are distinguished from the OC meteorites by higher
amounts of refractory lithophile elements and oxygen isotopic ratios near or below the ter-
restrial fractionation values. As further discussed below, many CC meteorites show evidence of
parent-body aqueous alteration early in solar system history, and clays and other alteration min-
erals are commonly found in their matrices. They need not be carbon-rich, despite their name,
though they can contain organic material. The CI group of CC is thought to be the closest match
to the Sun’s nonvolatile composition that we have in the meteorite collection.
The organic material in carbonaceous chondrites has been the subject of obvious interest in
the community. There is great variability in the composition of this organic material and in the
relative concentrations of soluble and insoluble material from one CC group to another. The
soluble material can vary greatly in abundance even in different parts of the same meteorite
(Pizzarello et al. 2006). Some of the molecules seen in the CC meteorites are also commonly
found in life on Earth, like amino acids. However, the variety found in these molecules and the
randomness of the mixtures in which they are found argues for their abiotic origin. Interest-
ingly, while both right-handed and left-handed versions of organic compounds are found in
the meteorites, there appears to be a slight excess of left-handed (Pizarello et al.). While the role
of meteoritic/asteroidal organic material in the origin of life on Earth is not settled, it has been
proposed that this excess could have formed the basis of the exclusively left-handed molecules
used by all terrestrial life.
The remaining chondrites (E, R, and ungrouped) cover a wide variety of properties and
mineralogies, but comprise only ∼2% of the chondrite falls, the vast majority of them in the E
(enstatite) chondrite group.
Although the chondrites did not suffer melting since the time they were assembled from
chondrules and matrix, many of them did experience some degree of thermal and aqueous
metamorphism. A numerical metamorphic grade can be assigned based on criteria like equi-
libration of iron and calcium, presence or absence of hydrated minerals, mineral textures, and
other factors, discussedin Huss et al. (2006). In the typical scheme,unmetamorphosed material
has a grade of 3, aqueous alteration leads to a grade between 1 and 3 (with 1 the most altered),
and thermal metamorphism to a grade between 3 and 6 (with 6 the most metamorphosed). A
heavily metamorphosed LL chondrite may be classified as LL6, then, while a heavily aqueously
altered carbonaceous chondrite may be a CI1. Some workers have subdivided the grades from
3 to 4 into decimal tenths, leading to an H3.1, for instance.
Achondrites comprise all of those meteorites which are not chondrites, including the small
fraction of meteorites that come from Mars and the Moon. All achondrites have been heated
to the point that their minerals melted, though the amount of melting varies widely. Some of
the achondrite parent bodies were heated to the point of differentiating into a rocky crust and
mantle over a metallic core. The iron meteorites represent not only fragments of such a core,
but also material that suffered local melting and metal separation.
The primitive achondrites include several groups that have experienced some melting, but
did not themselvescrystallize from a melt or are not from differentiated parent bodies, retaining
close geochemical similarities to the chondrites (Weisberg et al. 2006). Much work on primi-
tive achondrites is ongoing, and their place in an overall meteorite classification scheme is still
unsettled.
The most abundant achondrites (roughly 60% of achondrite falls) are the HED meteorites,
igneous material that has been linked to Vesta through spectral, dynamical, and geochemical
arguments (Keil 2002 and references therein). The HED meteorites are named for three sub-
groups: the howardites, eucrites, and diogenites. Eucrites are basaltic rocks that formed near

412 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
Vesta’s surface, while diogenites are orthopyroxene cumulatesthat originated deeperin its crust.
Howardites are brecciated mixtures of eucritic and diogenitic material. Interestingly, while the
case for Vesta as a HED parent body is robust, recent work suggests that at least two distinct
parent bodies are required to explain the difference in oxygen isotopes found among members
of the group (Yamaguchi et al. 2002). It is generally thought that the main HED group is the
one associated with Vesta rather than the less common Ibitira group, but work to conclusively
demonstrate this is still underway.
The angrite and aubrite groups are also basaltic rocks derived from the crust of differentiated
asteroidal parent bodies. The aubrites appear to be related to the E chondrites, perhaps with an
E chondrite precursor material, while the precursor material for angrites appears to be absent
from the meteorite collection.
The iron meteorites comprise 13 geochemically distinct groups, classified based on geo-
chemical and textural differences. It is thought that ten of these groups formed in the cores of
separate differentiated parent bodies, though other groups may be more consistent with for-
mation in melt pools rather than requiring full differentiation. In addition to these groups,
roughly 15% of iron meteorites are ungrouped, perhaps representing as many as 50 additional
parent bodies. Without additional samples to characterize trends within a group, it is not cer-
tain whether these ungrouped samples formed in the core of a differentiated object versus in
melt pools.
The final asteroidal achondrite groups are the mesosiderites and pallasites, both partially
silicate and partially metallic. The mesosiderites appear to have originated in a large impact,
which created a silicate-metal breccia (Scott et al. 2001). Pallasites are olivine-metal mixtures
of uncertain origin, with earlier theories suggesting they formed near a core-mantle boundary
and more recent ones proposing mixing of mantle and core material after a large impact (Yang
et al. 2010).
5.1 Isotopic Studies
The different geochemical behavior of various elements and isotopic mixes provides a means
of tracing asteroidal histories. Oxygen may be the most important of the stable isotopes. The
relative amounts of the three main oxygen isotopes (O, O, O) serve as a fingerprint,
homogeneous within a single parent body but differing from one body to the next, allow-
ing linkages to be recognized or rejected more easily (Weisberg et al. 2006). This, along with
other isotopic and mineralogic analysis, allows different meteorite groups from the same par-
ent body to be interpreted together, or alternately demonstrates that some meteorite types (e.g.,
the eucrites) are derived from more than one parent body.
Radioactive and radiogenic elementsare used to date geochemical events on asteroids using
the same techniques as in terrestrial studies. The different isotopic systems typically are used to
study different processes: the production of Ar by K in silicates is used to study the timing
of impacts, which release built-up Ar and “reset” the system.
In addition to the ongoing creation of radiogenic elements, the products of extinct radionu-
clides can also be studied in meteoritical materials, which have experienced little disturbance.
The isotope Hf decays into W with a half-life of 9 Myr. Hf is a strongly lithophile element,
while W is strongly siderophile. As a result, core formation in differentiated objects would have
effectively sequestered all W into the core, and any found today was created by the decay of
Hf. Studies using this dating system show that core formation occurred very early on in solar

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
413
system history, within the first few Myr. The extinct radionuclide Al is thought to have been
a primary heat source in the early solar system and decays into Mg. Determining the initial
concentration of Al in the solar nebula is critical to understanding the thermal history and
evolution of objects, but it is not straightforward since Mg is itself a commonly found isotope
and because relatively small differences in accretion rates can lead to large differences in the
amount of Al (with a half-life of ∼700,000 year) accreted in a body. Current estimates of the
initial Al /Al ratio are converging near × −(Halliday and Kleine 2006).
5.2 Asteroidal Compositions from Remote Sensing
The vast amount of available information about meteorite compositions has been leveraged
to help interpret asteroidal data. However, progress has been uneven in conclusively asso-
ciating asteroids with meteorite types and making quantitative measurements of asteroidal
compositions. The rate of asteroid discoveries far outpaces the rate at which those objects can
be characterized, even at a cursory level. > Figure 8-12, from a 2006 NASA study on haz-
ardous asteroid mitigation, was drafted in the context of near-Earth asteroid observations but
also applies well to the population as a whole: the number of objects that we can charac-
terize in great depth is relatively small, and what is learned from well-characterized objects

While many thousands of asteroids are known, very few are completely characterized. This ﬁgure
provides a schematic measure of the number of objects characterized to a particular level, with
associated mass uncertainties present for each level of characterization. While generated for near-
Earth objects speciﬁcally, the general form of this pyramid and its levels are applicable to the main-
belt asteroids as well (NASA)

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
must be applied to make educated estimates about the great numbers of poorly characterized
objects.
Visible and near-IR observations (wavelengths roughly 0.4–1.0 µm) were the first to be
made of the asteroids because of available technology and remain the easiest because of that
technology’s maturity and the relative transparency of the atmosphere in that spectral region.
Broadband photometry gave way to observations with specially selectedfilters by the late 1970s,
and the first asteroid taxonomies were constructed at that time. Vesta, the brightest asteroid,
was the first to be studied, and its spectral similarity to the HED meteorites was quickly noted
(McCord et al. 1970). This led to hopes that other asteroids would easily be associated with
meteorite types, and the first major taxonomic classes were somewhat optimistically named S,
C, and M for “stony,” “carbonaceous,” and “metal”: the three meteorite types they at least super-
ficially resembled. While later work has shown these mnemonics to be oversimplified at best,
later taxonomies are based on this early work.
Currently, there are two visible near-IR classification schemes in general use, the Tholen
and Bus taxonomies (Tholen 1984; Bus and Binzel 2002). Both use principal component analy-
sis techniques to find clusters of objects which are grouped together into classes and subclasses.
The Tholen taxonomy was created from eight-color spectrophotometric data, but also included
albedo information. The Bus taxonomy uses spectroscopic data of much higher spectral reso-
lution, but has more restricted wavelength coverage compared to what is used in the Tholen
taxonomy and does not include albedo. Both schemes use letter names for their classes, and
each has tried to stay consistent with predecessor taxonomies where possible. That has led to
good overall agreement with each other, but some level of confusion in detail as objects can be
classified differently in the different schemes, and an informal hybrid taxonomy has evolved in
some cases. >Table 8-2 shows the main classes in each taxonomic system, along with typical
examples.
The Tholen taxonomy (1984) separatesthe asteroids into three main classes:S, C, and X. The
X class is further divided based on albedo: high-albedo (>0.3) X asteroids belong to the E class,
medium (0.08–0.3) to the M, and low (<0.08) to the P. X asteroids with no albedo information
remain in the X class. C asteroids may be further classified into the B, F, or G subclasses based
on their albedos and UV reflectances. The A, Q, R, and V asteroids are close to the S class in
principal component space, but are not technically subclasses of it. The Q class is of particular
note because it has been associated with the OC meteorites and the search for Q-class aster-
oids in the main asteroid belt has long occupied asteroid scientists. At this writing, excellent
candidates for such objects have been identified (Mothé-Diniz et al. 2010; Rivkin et al. 2011b),
though consensus will likely require near-IR data to augment the available visible-wavelength
spectra. Finally, the D and T classes are transitional between the C and X classes.
The Bus taxonomy (Bus and Binzel 2002) uses the term “complex” to denote the largest
groupings: again S, C, and X. Subclassesare defined based on the presence or absence of specific
absorptions and inflections. The most notable subclass for our purposes is the Ch subclass,
which feature absorption bands near 0.7 µm associated with phyllosilicates (see below). The
lack of albedo information means that the E, M, and P classes are not defined and not used. The
other major Tholen classes are also found in the Bus taxonomy.
Gradie and Tedesco (1982) found that different regions in the asteroidbelt are dominatedby
different asteroid spectral classes (>Fig. 8-13). Subsequent work, including the very large cata-
log built using SDSSdata (>50,000 asteroids, >10,000 linked toknown objects: Ivezi´cetal. 2001),
has reinforced this result, although mixing between groups is certainly present and members
of each complex can be found in all regions.

The E-class asteroids (Tholen taxonomy) are the main population in the Hungaria region
at the inner edge of the main asteroid belt. The S asteroids dominate the inner belt, with the
C asteroids dominant through much of the rest of the main belt (and thought to be the most
abundant asteroids when considering the main belt as a whole). The outer-belt and Trojan aster-
oids are more poorly sampled, but appear to be mostly P-class (Tholen taxonomy) and D-class
asteroids.

This ﬁgure from Bus and Binzel (2002) demonstrates the changing distribution of asteroid spectral
types in the main belt. While the C complex is a major component throughout the region, it dom-
inates the middle and outer belt. The low-albedo D and T classes become more important in the
outer belt, while the S complex dominates the inner belt but becomes relatively unimportant as
semimajor axis increases (note the bump near 2.9 AU, due to the large S-class Koronis dynamical
family)
While visible observations were the first to be made for asteroids, the near-IR wavelengths
extending to 2.5 µm contain more diagnostic information for silicate minerals than the wave-
lengths shortward of 1 µm. As a consequence, and as detector technology matured, the number
of observations in the 0.8–2.5 µm region has grown greatly. An extension of the Bus taxonomic
system using data reaching 2.5 µm has been published by DeMeo et al. (2009) and is likely to
serve as the successor to the Bus system where the full span of wavelengths are available.
The most important absorption bands in this wavelength region are due to olivine (band
center near 1 µm) and pyroxene (bands near 1 and 2 µm). They are the dominant spectral
features in the S-complex asteroids as well as other higher albedo classes. Because of their
prominence in the spectra of the brightest asteroids, as well as importance for terrestrial
rocks, quantitative analyses have been developed to use these absorption bands to measure or
constrain silicate compositions (Gaffey et al. 2002; Sunshine et al. 2004; Dunn et al. 2010).

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
417
Compositional information is also obtained at longer wavelengths. The 3-µm region has
diagnostic absorptions due to water and hydroxyl, either bound into minerals or as free water
(or ice). It is also where organic material (containing C–H bonds) have strong absorptions. The
8–13 µm region is currently experiencing great interest, thanks in part to a large number of
Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) observations of asteroids. Both of these spectral regions are more
difficult to utilize than the 0.4–2.5 µm region because of competing absorptions in the Earth’s
atmosphere, which render certain wavelength ranges unobservable from the ground. However,
many absorption bands of interest are still easily detectable, and the anticipated launch of the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will cover spectral ranges unobservable from the surface
of the Earth, as did the SST.
The light analyzed in spectral studies typically penetrates a few wavelengths into the
material. For the visible-NIR studies most commonly done for asteroids, this is only a few
micrometers. However, because of regolith gardening and homogenization, it is thought that
the top several centimeters (or more) are well-mixed on asteroids and the very surface is repre-
sentative of much more than the top few micrometers. In addition, analysis and interpretation
of surface reflectance spectra can lead to insight about the entire body; for instance, the detec-
tion of igneous minerals on a body leads naturally to inferences about the history of that object,
as would a close to match to a particular meteorite group.
5.3 Compositions of Speciﬁc Objects and Classes: Current
Interpretations
Because of the long-standing “S-asteroid problem” (see above), those objects have been inten-
sively investigated using these techniques. Binzel et al. (2001) concluded the NEO 25143
Itokawa (then still known by its provisional designation 1998 SF36) was a space-weathered
LL chondrite, a conclusion borne out by the vis-NIR and X-ray spectrometers onboard the
Hayabusa spacecraft (Okada et al. 2006). Hayabusa’s return to Earth in June 2010 brought
back thousands of particles from this object, allowing the remote sensing datasets to be fur-
ther cross-checked, work that is ongoing at this writing. Further remote spectroscopic studies
of NEOs found a higher percentage of LL-like objects than expected from meteorite statistics, a
mismatch attributed by Vernazza et al. (2008) to delivery of different chondrite types from
different main-belt source regions via size-dependent mechanisms.
Gaffey et al. (1993) divided the S asteroids into seven subclasses based on their visible-NIR
spectra and interpretations of their olivine/pyroxene compositions and ratios. These subclasses
included the S(IV) group, thought to be consistent with the OCs, while the other groups cor-
responded to achondrites and hypothetical but yet-unseen mineralogies. Gaffey and Gilbert
(1998) studied the asteroid 6 Hebe in further detail, concluding it was akin to the H chondrites
and a “probable” parent body of those meteorites. Studies of 15 Eunomia, the largest S aster-
oid, point to a differentiated body, though the details of its surface metal content and exact
mineralogy vary among workers (Reed et al. 1997; Nathues et al. 2005; Moskovitz et al. 2008).
Spacecraft have encountered four S asteroids: 25143 Itokawa (mentioned above), 243 Ida,
951 Gaspra, and 433 Eros. While the Gaspra and Ida encounters were only flybys, the Galileo
spacecraft was able to return some spectral data for both asteroids.Gaspra was found to be more
olivine-rich than a typical S asteroid, while Ida had a spectrum consistent with a weathered
OC, and indeed the spatially resolved data available for Ida, and the spectral difference seen

418 8
An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
between fresh craters and older background areas, was one of the first demonstrations that space
weathering was occurring on asteroids (Chapman 1996).
Decades of study due to its status as one of the largest NEOs, along with the NEAR Shoe-
maker mission, have left 433 Eros as one of the best-understoodasteroids. A data set using both
visible-NIR imagery and NIR spectroscopy from NEAR Shoemaker led Izenberg et al. (2003)
to interpret Eros’ composition as consistent with L6 meteorites, with an opx/(opx+ol) ratio of
0.25–0.29. Lucey et al. (2002) looked at Eros’ spectral changes with temperature and concluded
it was most consistent with LL-type OCs, with H chondrites excluded. Lim and Nittler (2009)
performed a recalibration of the NEAR Shoemaker X-ray spectrometer (XRS) data, finding an
elemental composition like the OC meteorites, save a strong depletion of sulfur, which they
interpreted as due to space weathering.
While many of the recent studies are pointing toward space-weathered OC mineralogies
for many S asteroids, it is worth noting that this is not universally accepted. Abell et al. (2007)
have argued that Itokawa has experienced some partial melting and that its spectrum is not
consistent with OC compositions per se. Similarly, Gaffey (2010) asserts that space weathering
does not change important spectral parameters and ought not be invoked to explain some mis-
matches.Conversely, Mothé-Diniz et al. (2010) argued that OC spectra can be found that match
non-Q asteroids and that the Sq and Sk groups in the Bus taxonomy might also be viable OC
analogs.
Observations of Vesta from the HST and ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive
optics (AO) have provided spatially resolved spectral information, augmented by point-source
observations obtained over a full rotation. These studies have found Vesta to have hemispheric-
level differences in spectral properties, with one hemisphere more akin to the diogenite mete-
orites and the other analogous to the eucrites (Binzel et al. 1997). The eucritic regions have been
interpreted as the original basaltic surface of Vesta, with a lower albedo than the other regions
due to particle size differences, regolith maturation, or other effects (Gaffey 1997). Imagery
also shows evidence for a giant crater near Vesta’s south pole, but there have not been spec-
tral observations with viewing geometry favorable to studying the crater. The 3-µm region
shows evidence of a roughly 1–2% reduction in reflectance compared to the 2.5 µm region,
but interpretations have ranged from the influence of carbonaceous impactors in the regolith
to simple variations in continuum behavior (Hasegawa et al. 2003; Rivkin et al. 2006). The dis-
covery of water/OH in the lunar regolith, interpreted as formed through solar wind interactions
with the regolith, has created further possibilities for Vesta.
Investigations of additional V-class asteroids, both in the NEO population and in the main
belt, have demonstrated spectral similarities, though there is some evidence that the smaller
objects (often termed “vestoids” if they are dynamically linked to Vesta) may have been space
weathered differently than Vesta and may only represent a fraction of the materials present
on Vesta itself (Shestopalov et al. 2010). Those V asteroids that are not dynamically linked to
the Vesta family show some spectral differences compared to Vesta, though it is not yet clear
to what extent this is due to different mineralogy and to what extent it is due to the different
temperatures experienced by these objects. A more thorough understanding of Vesta and V
types awaits the arrival of the Dawn spacecraft.
Understanding of low-albedo objects has lagged compared to the S asteroids and Vesta due
to the lack of strong, diagnostic absorptions in the 0.4–2.5 µm region where most asteroidal
observations have been made. A broad absorption band near 0.7 µm has been interpreted as
due to Fe2+–Fe3+ intervalence charge transfers and is associated with (though not diagnos-
tic of) phyllosilicate minerals (Vilas 1994). This band is an integral part of the Bus taxonomy,

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
419
is the discriminator of the Ch and Cgh taxonomic classes, and is also seen in some carbonaceous
chondrites. A strong UV absorption is also seen in the Tholen C-class asteroids (the spectro-
scopic data used by Bus does not consistently extend to short enough wavelengths to see this
band) and is due to oxidized iron. Because of the strong absorptions due to water and OH in
the 3-µm region, observations in this region have provided more insight into the C-asteroid
population.
Ceres is the best-understood of the low-albedo asteroids. Its 0.4–2.5 µm spectrum is largely
featureless, other than a broad band centered near 1.2 µm that is likely due to Fe3+, possibly
in magnetite. A series of absorptions in the 3.0–3.3 µm region have been interpreted separately
and as a group. The most recent interpretation for the bands, by Milliken and Rivkin (2009),
is brucite (responsible for the band near 3.05 µm) and carbonates (responsible for the bands at
3.3–3.4 µm as well as additional bands near 3.7–3.8 µm). These minerals would have formed
during intense aqueous alteration of an olivine-rich assemblage early in Ceres’ history. Inter-
pretations of mid-IR observations are consistent with the 3-µm data. Still unidentified in Ceres’
spectrum is an absorption near 0.25 µm, though anticipated advances in UV spectral libraries
and additional UV asteroidal observations should aid its interpretation.
The asteroid 24 Themis, largest member of the Themis asteroid family, is observed to have
some water ice on its surface, probably as thin coatings on silicate grains, as well as organic
material consistent with ice tholins and material seen in carbonaceous chondrites (Rivkin and
Emery 2010; Campins et al. 2010). Hydrated minerals are not seen on Themis, consistent with
any interior ice remaining unmelted since accretion. The cometary activity seen in the “main-
belt comets,” many of which are in the Themis dynamical family, is most likely driven by ice
sublimation, which is consistent with what is seen on Themis. The uncertainty in measurements
of Themis’ obliquity combined with the extreme sensitivity of ice stability to small changes
in temperature near Themis’ expected temperature leaves current models undecided on the
required resupply rate to Themis’ surface from its interior. Indeed, for some obliquities surface,
ice remains stable over a range of latitudes sufficient to account for the existence of ice (Rivkin
and Emery 2010).
While Ceres and Themis are the best-studied of the C asteroids at 3 µm, dozens of other
objects have also been observed. These seem to have band shapes that separate into a three
to four different classes, though a formal taxonomy has not been established at this writing.
Rivkin (2007) informally named these groups after their most prominent members: Ceres type,
Pallas type, Cybele type (or Themis type), and anhydrous. Members of the same group might
be expected to have similar mineralogies, but modeling of spectra as well as a more formal tax-
onomy will be necessary to strictly reach that conclusion. The Pallas types, the most common
of these groupings, appear to be at least qualitatively consistent with the carbonaceous chon-
drite meteorites. The Ceres types are presumed to have surfaces with compositions similar to
Ceres’ surface as mentioned above: brucite and carbonates along with a low-albedo component
and possible other aqueous alteration products. The Cybele types, which include Themis, may
include a wider range of mineralogies and may be split into several groups. However, other ice
and organic-bearing objects might be in this group. The “anhydrous” objects need to be con-
sidered with some caution: in some cases, the available data have large uncertainties and are
classified here as a default. In all cases, this group technically only has upper limits on band
depth, and higher-quality data and/or spectral coverage now unavailable could plausibly find
evidence for a band currently not detected or undetectable from Earth’s surface.
The asteroid 2008 TC3 had spectral properties that would place it in the C complex, and
pieces ofit were recovered afterits impact nearthe Egypt-Sudan border. These pieces, referred to

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites
as the Almahata Sitta meteorite, are mostly classified as ureilites, one of the primitive achondrite
groups mentioned above (Jenniskens et al. 2009). However, small clasts from other meteorite
groups including ordinary chondrites were also found, suggesting meter-class objects could
have significant heterogeneity, presumably via collision-induced mixing while still in a regolith
on a larger parent body (Zolensky et al. 2010).
The D-class asteroids found in the outer asteroid belt and Trojan clouds, as well as some
planetary satellite populations, are featureless throughout the 0.4–4 µm region. This is some-
what surprising, as their steepspectral slopes are very similar to what is seen in cometary nuclei,
which has led to their interpretation as organic-rich objects by analogy. However, the absorp-
tions due to C–H bands, like those found on 24 Themis, are absent from similar spectra of the D
asteroids. Their faintness, due to their low albedo and residences further from the Sun, may be
in part to blame. Cruikshank et al. (2001) analyzed the spectrum of the large Trojan asteroid624
Hektor, finding its surface composition to be fit by a combination of magnesium-rich pyroxene
and low-albedo neutral material like elemental carbon, with the steep spectral slopes provided
by the pyroxene. Cruikshank et al. note, however, that up to a few percent of volatile mate-
rial could still be present in the form of ice or hydrous silicates but masked by the low-albedo
material. Emery and Brown (2004) modeled the spectra of several Trojan asteroids through the
visible and near IR (out to 4 µm), extending the findings of Cruikshank et al. and concluding
that organic-rich material was very unlikely to be responsible for the steep spectral slopes of the
Trojans in general. Further work by Emery et al. (2006) using mid-IR (5.2–38 µm) observations
from the Spitzer Space Telescope found evidence for fine-grained silicates on Trojan surfaces
and emission spectra more typical to what is seen in cometary comae than asteroidal regoliths.
This is suggestive of a severelyunderdensesurface, or perhaps grains embeddedin a transparent
matrix.
The last major complex is the X complex, whose members are usually studied in the con-
text of their Tholen classes (E, M, and P). The P class has not been the recipient of intense
study, as its properties are similar to and sometimes overlap the C class and related groups, and
indeed, some Tholen P asteroids are classified in the C complex in the Bus taxonomy. Hiroi
et al. (2004) interpreted the P asteroids as akin to the carbonaceous chondrites, intermediate
between the CI/CM and Tagish Lake meteorites and perhaps having experienced thermal and
aqueous alteration.
The M-class asteroids have long been associated with iron meteorites and enstatite chon-
drites, both of which are relatively featureless in the 0.4–2.5 µm region. However, observations
in the 3-µm region by Jones et al. (1990) and Rivkin et al. (1995, 2000) found absorptions in
roughly a third of the M asteroids surveyed, with a strong size correlation. These 3-µm bands
were interpreted as evidence that the M asteroids could not all be iron meteorite parents. In
addition, higher spectral resolution in the visible and near IR has shown the presence of silicate
absorptions in a large number of M asteroids (Hardersen et al. 2005), and it is recognized that
a relatively wide variety of mineralogies are consistent with what is seen in the class.
While metal is featureless in visible-near IR wavelengths and thus spectral bands diagnos-
tic for metal do not exist, thermal and radar data can provide more insights. Radar studies
summarized by Shepard et al. (2010) show a wide range in the radar albedos of M asteroids,
ranging from what is expected of pure metal surfaces to values more typical of rocky bodies.
The radar albedo of an object is a function of both surface porosity and metal content, and only
a handful of objects have radar albedos high enough to unambiguously require a high metal
content. Radar-shape modeling of 216 Kleopatra shows a remarkable “dog bone” shape along

An Overview of the Asteroids and Meteorites 8
421
with a very high metal content. The asteroid 16 Psyche also has a high-radar albedo and is gen-
erally interpreted as a metallic core of a disrupted, differentiated body. Given Psyche’s size, the
original parent body must have been roughly the size of Vesta before it was disrupted. Shepard
et al. found seven M asteroids had radar albedos indicative of high metal content, but suggested
that most M-class asteroids are neither remnant cores or enstatite chondrites, but are instead
composites more akin to stony iron meteorites or high-iron carbonaceous chondrites. Shepard
et al. also noted a positive correlation between visual and radar albedos for the M asteroids that
had moderate metal content, though they were uncertain as to the cause. Observations in the
mid-IR by Lim and Emery (2006) also show a range of thermal properties for M asteroids, again
with some objects consistent with the S and C asteroids and others with behavior more consis-
tent with high metal contents. With only one possible exception, 129 Antigone, those objects
seen to have a 3-µm band by Rivkin et al. are also the objects more consistent with lower metal
abundances. Ockert-Bell studied 16 M and X asteroids, 9 of which had radar albedos available,
and found a positive correlation between the 1.7–2.45 µm spectral slope and radar albedo.
The Rosetta spacecraft encountered two X asteroids: the E-class asteroid 2867 Šteins and
the M-class asteroid 21 Lutetia. Data from Lutetia were collected over a very wide range of
wavelengths, from the far UV (∼0.1 µm) through the visible and infrared to 5 µm, with some
millimeter-wave data also collected. Data from the encounter is still under analysis at this writ-
ing, but it is already well established from ground-based data that Lutetia does not have a high
metal content at its surface, as reviewed by Belskaya et al. (2010).
E-class asteroids are distinguished by their high-albedos and featureless spectra and have
been associated with the aubrite meteorites. As with the M asteroids (and D asteroids), the
lack of interpretable absorption bands has hampered a full understanding of this class. Some
E asteroids, notably 64 Angelina and 317 Roxane, possess an absorption band near 0.5 µm.
This has been interpreted as due to sulfides, particularly oldhamite (CaS), though oldhamite has
a significantly lower albedo than the E asteroids. Clark et al. (2004) performed mixing models
based on Hapke theory on 9 E asteroids and divided them into 3 groups, “Nysa-like,” “Angelina-
like,” and “Hungaria-like.” In addition to a high-albedo mineral like enstatite in each group,
the Nysa-like group was interpreted as bearing a low-iron orthopyroxene, the Angelina-like
group possibly containing oldhamite and forsterite, and the Hungaria-like group “not inconsis-
tent” with aubrites. Clark et al. concluded the aubrites were only likely to have come from the
Hungaria-like group with the others unrepresented among the meteorites. Gaffey and Kelley
(2004) independently but similarly divided the E asteroids into three groups. The 0.5-µm band
is the basis for the Xe class in the Bus taxonomy, but it is cautioned that there is not a one-to-
one correspondence between the E and Xe classes in the two taxonomies, as evidenced by the
E asteroids in Clark et al. and Kelley et al. that do not have the 0.5-µm band.
Benner et al. (2008) found a correlation between the radar polarization ratio (usually inter-
preted as a function of surface roughness) and NEO spectral class, with the E-class asteroids
exhibiting the highest SC/OC (same sense circular polarization to opposite sense circular polar-
ization) ratios. This is suggestive of very high roughness on these objects on centimeter to
decimeter scales. Benner et al. also note a surprisingly high fraction of E asteroids in their sam-
ple, roughly six times higher than the fraction of aubrites seen in the meteorite collection. It
is not clear why this is the case, though possibilities they considered include extreme fragility
for aubrites or additional analogs for the E asteroids unrecognized in the meteorite collection.
They also identified several candidate E-class objects based on radar polarization alone, with
confirmation via spectroscopy still pending.

Extensive photometric stellar surveys show that many main-sequence stars show emission at
infrared and longer wavelengths that is in excess of the stellar photosphere; this emission is
thought to arise from circumstellar dust. The presence of dust disks is confirmed by spatially
resolved imaging at infrared to millimeter wavelengths (tracing the dust thermal emission) and
at optical to near-infrared wavelengths (tracing the dust scattered light). Because the expected
lifetime of these dust particles is much shorter than the age of the stars (>10year), it is inferred
that this solid material not primordial, i.e., the remaining from the placental cloud of gas and
dust where the star was born, but instead is replenished by dust-producing planetesimals. These
planetesimals are analogous tothe asteroids, comets, and Kuiperbelt objects (KBOs)in oursolar
system that produce the interplanetary dust that gives rise to the zodiacal light (tracing the inner
component of the solar system debris disk). The presence of these “debris disks” around stars
with a wide range of masses, luminosities, and metallicities, with and without binary compan-
ions, is evidence that planetesimal formation is a robust process that can take place under a
wide range of conditions.
This chapter is divided in two parts. Part I discusses how the study of the solar system debris
disk and the study of debris disks around other stars can help us learn about the formation,
evolution, and diversity of planetary systems by shedding light on the frequency and timing
of planetesimal formation, the location and physical properties of the planetesimals, the pres-
ence of long-period planets, and the dynamical and collisional evolution of the system. It first
describes the interplanetary dust in the inner and outer solar system and the evolution of dust
production though the solar system’s history, followed by a summary of the properties of debris
disks around other stars (their frequency, evolution, spatial structure, and composition). Part II
reviews the physical processes that affect dust particles in the gas-free environment of a debris
disk, like the solar system’s interplanetary space, and their effect on the dust particle size and
spatial distribution; the discussion focuses on radiation and stellar wind forces, gravitational
forces in the presence of planets and grain collisions.

Part I: Solar and Extrasolar Debris Disks
1.1 Debris Disks Are Evidence of the Presence of Extrasolar
Planetesimals
Circumstellar disks play a fundamental role in the formation of stars and planets and the
subsequent evolution of planetary systems. Pre-stellar disks form from the contraction and con-
servation of angular momentum of the densest regions of molecular clouds (consisting on gas
and dust in a 100:1 mass ratio). The accretion of mass onto the forming star is regulated by
mass and angular momentum transfer mechanisms within the disk and requires the ejection
of material and angular momentum by bipolar outflows. With time, the mass reservoir of the
cloud gets depleted, the disk begins to dissipate from the inside out, and the transfer of mass
onto the star weaken. Observations indicate that by 3 Myr, half of the disks show inner cavities
10s of AU in size, and the signatures of mass accretion onto the star weakens. Simultaneously,
planet formation takes place by accretion of dust particles into larger and larger bodies, result-
ing in a few massive cores and a swarm of embryos. Because the formation of giant planets
requires a gas disk to provide material for the formation of a gaseous envelope around a massive
core, it needs to happen before the protoplanetary gas disk dissipates in approximately 6 Myr.

Dusty Planetary Systems
These massive planets might be responsible for carving the large inner cavities inferred to be
present in young disks. Spitzer Space Telescope surveys indicate that the majority of young stars
(with stellar types later than B) are surrounded by gas-rich protoplanetary disks, indicating that
most stars harbor the raw material required to form planetary systems. The formation of terres-
trial planets and massive planets beyond the ice line is not limited by the presence of gas in the
disk and continues for approximately 100 Myr; a critical step in this process is the formation of
planetesimals.
Observations with Spitzer show that there is evidence that at least 15% of mature stars
(10 Myr–10 Gyr) of a wide range of masses (0.5–3 MSun) harbor planetesimal belts with sizes
of 10s–100s AU. This evidence comes from the presence of an infrared emission in excess of
that expected from the stellar photosphere, thought to arise from a circumstellar dust disk. The
reason why these dust disks are evidence of the presence of planetesimals is because the life-
time of the dust grains is of the order of 0.01–1 Myr (see > Sects. 2.1.4 and >2.3.1), much
shorter than the age of the star (>10 Myr); therefore, the origin of these dust grains cannot be
primordial, i.e., from the cloud of gas and dust where the star was born, but must be the result
of ongoing dust production generated by planetesimals, like the asteroids, comets, and Kuiper
belt objects (KBOs) in our solar system (see > Figs. 9-1 and >9-2). This is why these dust disks
are known as debris disks.
Debris disks are therefore evidence of the formation of planetesimals around other stars.
The study of this population of extrasolar planetesimals can give us a more complete picture of
the diversity of planetary systems, shedding light on their formation and dynamical histories.
Even though these planetesimals will remain undetected in the foreseeable future, the study of
theirdebris dust can helpus learn about some ofthe planetesimals’ characteristics (e.g., location,
composition, and evolution). Debris disks can also help us learn about the planet population.

Dust production by the inner belt asteroid P/2010A2 as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope
Wide Field Camera 3. Its comet-like morphology is due to a tail of millimeter-sized dust particles
emanating from a 120 m nucleus (Figure from Jewitt et al. (2010))
As will be discussed in > Sects. 1.3.3 and >2.2, the structure of the debris disk is sensitive
to planets with a wide range of masses and semimajor axes and is independent of the system’s
age (see >Fig. 9-3). Therefore, the study of debris disk structure can serve as a planet-detection
method, covering a parameter space complementary to that of radial velocity, transit, and direct
imaging techniques. The goal of this chapter is to describe how debris disks can shed light on
the formation, evolution, and diversity of planetary systems, helping us place our solar system
into context.
1.2 The Solar System Debris Disk
The Sun also harbors a disk of dust produced in the inner and outer solar system by its popula-
tion of minor bodies, like the asteroids, Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), and comets (>Fig. 9-1).
1.2.1 Debris Dust in the Inner Solar System
>Figure 9-2 shows an spectacular example of the production of dust by the asteroid P/2010A2
(from Jewitt et al. 2010). In this case, the dust is produced either by the rotational disruption
of the asteroid (due to the spin-up produced by radiation torques) or by the collision with a
meter-sized projectile, an event that must have taken place around February or March 2009.
Long before the technological developmentallowed detailed images like this one to be obtained,
there were some phenomena, visible to the naked eye and that must have been noticed since the
beginning of humankind, that hinted that our planetary system was a dusty one: the zodiacal
light, the “shooting stars,” and the comet tails. Their analysis with current instrumentation sheds
light on the origin and properties of the solar system’s debris dust.

Zodiacal Dust
The zodiacal light is a glow that appears along the ecliptic and can be seen about an hour before
and after sunset (in the Eastern and Western horizons, respectively). The term “zodiacal” refers
to its location along the ecliptic. It is caused by the scattering of solar photons by the dust grains
in the inner solar system. It appeared in ancient Egyptian art represented by a triangle inclined
with respect to the horizon (worshiped as the war god Sopdu), and it was also known to the
Greek and the Romans, the Chaldeans, and the Aztecs (Codex Telleriano-Remensis). The first
explicit description in Europe appeared in 1661 (Childrey’s Britannia Raconica) and the first
scientific observations were done by Cassini in 1683, and correctly interpreted by de Duiliers
a year later as produced by sunlight reflected from small particles orbiting the Sun. Scattered
light observations of the zodiacal light can help determine the properties of the dust particles,
revealing nonspherical, irregular, or fluffy aggregates, 10–100 μm in size grain (see >Fig. 9-4),

composed of a mixture of silicates and organic material with a low albedo of ∼0.08. Regarding
their spatial distribution, the observed brightness profile of the scattered light follows r−.from
0.3 to 1 AU, r−.out to 2.3 AU, and r−.out to the asteroid belt, corresponding to a number
density distribution not too different from the r−dependency expected in the case of dust
dynamics dominated by Poynting-Robertson drag (see >Sect. 2.1.5). It is also observed that
the plane of symmetry of the zodiacal light is warped, as a result of gravitational perturbations
by the planets (see > Sects. 2.2.3 and >2.2.4). The motion of the dust particles can be studied
from the absorption lines in the scattered stellar light, revealing particles in elliptical prograde
orbits that belong to two dust populations: one with a spherical distribution and a r−number
density radial profile, likely due to dust particles produced by long-period comets, and another
with a flattened low inclination distribution and a number density r−dependency, likely due
to asteroids or short-period comets (see review in Levasseur-Regourd et al. 2001 and references
therein).
The heating of the dust particles by the Sun makes them emit at infrared and submillime-
ter wavelengths; this thermal emission dominates the night sky between 5 and 500 μm and
has been mapped by the IRAS, COBE, ISO, and Spitzer Space Telescopes. These observations
indicate that the ratio of the dust-to-stellar luminosities, known as the fractional luminosity,
is f = Ldust/L⊙∼10−–10−(Dermott et al. 2002); this is more than two orders of magnitude
fainter than the extrasolar debris disks observed with Spitzer (see >Fig. 9-8 – the difference
being due to the limited sensitivity of the Spitzer observations). It is inferred that the particles
dominating the thermal emission from the zodiacal cloud are rapidlyrotating grains 10–100 μm
in size, with low albedos, located near 1 AU, and with an amorphous forsterite/olivine compo-
sition; there is also a population of smaller 1 μm-sized grains made of crystalline olivine and
hydrous silicate that accounts for a weak silicate emission feature at 10 μm (from the vibration
of stretching Si-O bonds – Reach et al. 2003). The laboratory analysis of interplanetary dust
particles (IPDs) collected in the Earth’s stratosphere also reveals this mixture of amorphous
and crystalline olivine and pyroxene that has also been identified in the mid-infrared spectra of
extrasolar debris disks (see >Sect. 1.3.5). Regarding the spatial distribution, the thermal emis-
sion from the zodiacal cloud shows long, narrow arcs that coincide with the perihelion passage

of some short-period comets (produced by low albedo, porous, millimeter-sized dust particles),
and broader dust bands at low ecliptic latitudes, thought to originate from the breakup of the
asteroids that gave rise to the Themis, Koronis, and Eos asteroidal families (Sykes and Green-
berg 1986 and Dermott et al. 2002 argued that the formation of the Veritas family 8.3 Myr ago
accounts for ∼25% of the zodiacal thermal emission today). The gravitational perturbations
exerted by the planets are also evident in the spatial distribution of the thermal emission: a ring
of asteroidal dust particles is trapped in the exterior mean motion resonances (MMRs) with the
Earth at around 1 AU, forming a ring-like structure with a 10% number density enhancement
on the Earth’s wake that results from the resonance geometry of the 1:1 MMR (Dermott et al.
1994b; Reach et al. 1995; see discussion in >Sect. 2.2.4).
Dust Particles Falling on Earth
“Shooting stars” are evidence that dust particles fall on Earth. This phenomenon, that must
have been noticed since the beginning of humankind, is produced by the ionization of atmo-
spheric atoms along the path of the incoming high-velocity dust grain. The grain generally gets
destroyed before it reaches the surface ofthe Earth because the impact ofatmosphericmolecules
increases its temperature to ∼1,000–2,000 K, at which point the grain’s atoms and molecules
begin to ablate; another destruction process is the loss of the volatile glue that maintains the
aggregate together. The trails can be used to trace back the orbits of the incoming dust particles,
revealing that most ofthe sporadicmeteors are generated byparticles on prograde, low eccentric
orbits, with small relative velocities with respect to the Earth of a few km/s. Meteors also occur
in showers when the Earth crosses the dusty trail of an asteroid or a comet, the latter produced
by the gradual released of dust during ice sublimation or by the breakup of inactive comets.
The origin of the dust can be traced back to the parent body because their orbital elements
remain similar during the first 10years (see review in McDonnell et al. 2001 and references
therein).
Some ofthe dust grains survive atmosphericentryand can be collected on the Earth’s surface
(from deep sea sediments and Greenland and Antarctic ice) in the form of micrometeorites
with sizes in the 20 μm–1 mm range (Maurette et al. 1994). Because of the effect of atmospheric
entry, particles larger than 50 μm are strongly affected, and there is a selection effect against
particles with high entry velocities, high densities, and/or fragile structure. Micrometeorites
can be collected in the Antarctic ice, e.g., at the bottom of the water well of the Amundsen-
Scott South Pole Station, where the particles accumulate as the ice melts during the drilling of
the well; a ton of this ice contains approximately 100 cosmic spherules larger than 50 μm and
about 500 micrometeorites in the 50–400 μm range (Maurette et al. 1994, 1996); the slope of
the cumulative size distribution for particles larger than 200 μm is −5.2. The estimated particle
flux, compared to that found in the upper atmosphere in a similar size range, indicates that
only about 4% of the incoming dust grains survive atmospheric entry. Micrometeorites have
also been collected in deep sea sediments (see >Sect. 1.2.3). The fate of the organic material on
the dust particles that enter the Earth’s atmosphere is particularly interesting for astrobiology;
this matter may survive entry if it is in the form of complex compounds. (For a review, see
Jessberger et al. (2001) and references therein.)
Dust particles can also be collected from the Earth’s stratosphere using aerogel collecting
plates on high-altitude flying aircraft. These interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are distin-
guished from high-altitude terrestrial dust (e.g., the dust produced by solid rockets) by their
elemental and isotopic composition, and by the effect of their long journey in interplane-
tary space, the latter revealed by He atoms implanted by the solar wind in the bubbles, voids,

Dusty Planetary Systems 9
439
and crystal defects of the grains, and by the radiation damage due to the impacts with high-
energy cosmic rays and stellar wind particles. The collected IDPs are on average 15 μm in
size (with a size range of 5–25 μm determined by the collecting method and the terrestrial
contaminants). >Figure 9-4 shows a typical IDP, formed by aggregates of thousands to mil-
lions of submicron grains, with about 40% porosity and a bulk density of about 2 g/cm−
(this is consistent with the formation of the IDP as a random aggregate of similar-sized com-
ponents). About 85% of the IDPs are formed by aggregates of different minerals (chondritic
composition), while the rest are aggregates of just a few minerals (nonchondritic composition).
Chondritic IDPs tend to be dark (with low albedos of 0.05–0.15, due to the presence of car-
bon, sulfides, and nanometer-sized metal grains), and their mineralogy is similar to that of
the matrix of some carbonaceous chondrites and can be anhydrous (dominated by olivine and
pyroxene) or hydrous; their structure ranges from porous (generally anhydrous silicates) to
compact (generally hydrated silicates that have been subject to aqueous alteration). Because
the chondritic IDPs are aggregates of thousands to millions of mineral grains, their overall
elemental composition is similar to solar. The entry velocities of the IDPs can be estimated
from the amount of solar wind-implanted He that was lost during atmospheric entry (due to
the heating of the dust particles). There are two populations of IDPs: (1) Low-velocity grains
(<14 km/s), likely associated with the low eccentricity and low inclination orbits of asteroidal
dust; they tend to be compact, with average bulk densities of about 3 g/cm, and they com-
monly have a chondritic composition of low crystalline Fe–Mg hydrous silicates similar to that
of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. (2) High-velocity grains (>18 km/s), with velocities sim-
ilar to those expected from cometary dust; they have low bulk densities of about 1 g/cm, and
a composition is similar to that found in comets, e.g., Hale-Bopp, with both crystalline and
noncrystalline Fe–Mg anhydrous silicate minerals (pyroxenes and olivines) and GEMS. (For a
review, see Jessberger et al. (2001) and references therein.)
In Situ Dust Detections in the Inner Solar System
Another of the earliest observations of debris dust in the solar system are the sightings of comet
tails. Records of comets appear as early as in Chinese oracle bones, and in many cultures, they
have been considered bad omens. Comets are now treasured as the most pristine planetesimals
in the solar system, harboring invaluable information about our planetary system’s formation
and evolution. Comets are one of the main sources of dust; because sublimation drives the
cometary activity, it is assumed that their dust production generally takes place in the inner
solar system. However, there are isolated flare-ups that also produce dust at large heliocentric
distances. The dust production rate of comets is difficult to estimatebecause the cometary activ-
ity is not steady (e.g., comet Holmes had a massive mass loss in 2007 that made it become 10
times brighter in a day – Li et al. 2010). A study by Nesvorný et al. (2010) concluded that about
85% of the dust in the inner solar system is produced by Jupiter-family comets and <10% by
long-period comets (a result that is model dependent).
Cometary dust particles have been studied in situ in the case of comets Halley, Tempel 1,
and Wild 2 using instruments on-board the VeGa 1, VeGa 2, Giotto, Deep Impact, and Stardust
spacecrafts. Deep Impact sent a copper-core impactor into comet Tempel 1 to study the ejected
cloud of subsurface material (observed from ground-based telescopes and from the flyby sec-
tion of the spacecraft). It found that the surface of the comet was more dusty than expected,
depleted of ice that is present at depths of about 1 m (A’Hearn 2008); ground-based observa-
tions of the dust cloud released by the impact revealed the presence of forsterite (MgSiO) and
enstatite (MgSiO). Comet Wild 2 was the target of the Stardust mission that was able to return

440 9

cometary dust particles to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis. Their study reveals that even
though Wild 2 is thought to have originated in the cold environment of the Kuiper belt, it con-
tains aggregates where highly refractory and volatile components are found close together in
the micron-scale, indicating that the comet has aggregated dust particles that have formed at a
very wide range of heliocentric distances: there is pre-solar material identified from the isotopic
evidence and that has suffered little alteration since it was accreted; there are large 5 μm Fe-poor
forsterite crystals that are likely formed from the vaporization, melting, or heating of material
above 1,000 K; there are calcium-aluminium inclusions (CAIs – the oldest solids of the Solar
system) thought to have condensed at very high temperatures during a brief period of time and
that must have been transported from the inner solar system (where CAIs formed) to the region
where the comet formed, and there are also amorphous glassy grains, some of which have an
interstellar origin. The returned samples contained a broad range of minerals, each of which
has been found in primitive meteorites but never such a rich diversity in the same object. This
heterogeneous mixture is far from being in chemical or mineralogical equilibrium (Brownlee
et al. 2006; McKeegan et al. 2006; Zolensky et al. 2006a; Sandford et al. 2006).
Dust particles have also been detected in situ at different heliocentric distances by the
spacecrafts HEOS (1 AU), Hitten (1 AU), Helios (0.3–1 AU), Galileo (0.7–5 AU), Pioneer 8 and 9
(0.75–1.08 AU), Ulysses (1.3–2.3 AU), Cassini, and Pioneer 10 and 11. Impact velocities >1 km/s
result in the vaporization and ionization of material from the target and the impactor that is sep-
arated by an applied electric field and produces an electronic signal that depends on the mass,
velocity, and chemical composition of the impacting grain. One of the challenges is to calibrate
the detectors in the laboratory using impactors with characteristics similar to that of interplane-
tary particles. Another challenge is that these in situ measurementsare limited to the trajectory
of the spacecraft, so the interpretation of the impact data depends on assumptions regarding the
dust spatial distribution. These measurements are also biased against particles at high inclina-
tions because they spend little time near the ecliptic where most of the experiments take place
(see review by Grün et al. 2001).
The current dust production rate in the inner solar system is of the order of 10kg/s; the
relative contribution of the different sources is still under debate and has likely changed with
time. As was mentioned above, Nesvorný et al. (2010) argued that the splitting of Jupiter-family
comets accounts for 85% of the dust in the inner solar system with <10% produced by Oort
cloud long-period comets, while a previous study by Dermott et al. (1994b) concluded that the
asteroids contribute to at least 33%; other contributors of dust to the inner solar system could
include Halley-type comets and KBOs.
1.2.2 Debris Dust in the Outer Solar System
As discussed in > Sect. 1.2.1, the dust in the inner solar system (“zodiacal dust”) has been
studied via remote observations of its scattered light and thermal emission. The situation is
very different for the dust in the outer solar system, for which no remote detections have been
achieved so far: at optical wavelengths, its emission is dwarfed by the much brighter zodiacal
light in the foreground, while at infrared and longer wavelengths, its emission is also con-
founded by the thermal emission of the zodiacal dust in the foreground and emission from
the galactic dust (known as the “cirrus”) in the background. The cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation provides a very uniform source against which emission from the Kuiper belt
(KB) might be detected in the future. The derived upper limit on the total mass of dust in the

outer solar system is about 10−M⊕or 10kg, a thousand times the mass inferred from the
Voyager 1 detection experiments (Backman et al. 1995; Jewitt and Luu 2000; Moro-Martín and
Malhotra 2003). Dynamical modeling of the dust produced in the Kuiper belt, together with
recent in situ detections by the New Horizons spacecraft, indicates that the fractional luminos-
ity of the Kuiper belt dust, Ldust/LSun, is ∼10−; this is below the detection limit Herschel/PACS,
meaning that Kuiper belt dust disk analogs around other stars could not be detected with
present-day instrumentation in space (Vitense et al. 2012).
Pioneer 10 and 11 detected dust out to 18 and 13 AU, respectively, with detectors that con-
sisted on pressurized gas cells with metallic walls 25–50 μm thick that would lose pressure when
penetrated by a projectile (with the problem that the usable area of the detectordiminished with
time). For the detectable mass range (10−–10−kg for impact velocities of 20 km/s), it was
found that the flux was nearly constant between Jupiter and 18 AU (Humes 1980). Even though
Pioneer 10 and 11 did not sample the KB region directly (because the former failed at 18 AU
and the latter was turned off at 13 AU), dynamical models indicate and that the KB was likely
the source of the dust detected beyond 10 AU (Landgraf et al. 2002). Therefore, the detection
of Kuiper belt dust preceded the discovery of the Kuiper belt itself by Jewitt and Luu (1993),
but at the time the origin of the dust went unrecognized. The dynamical models also require
a significant contribution from comets (including short-period Oort cloud and Jupiter-family
comets) to account for the flat number density distribution of the dust.
Voyager detected dust in the 30–60 AU Kuiper belt region with a number density of
n ∼2 × 10−m−. The data remains poorly calibrated because the detections were done indi-
rectly by measuring the pulses in the conductivity of the medium adjacent to the spacecraft,
caused by plasma generated from the vaporization of the impactor; it is thought that small-
est dust particles detected were s ∼μm in size (Gurnett et al. 1997). Because the size of
the dust particles follows a power-law distribution (see > Sect. 2.3.2), a reasonable approxi-
mation is that most impactors were of this minimum size. Adopting a KB vertical height of
H ∼10 AU, this would correspond to an optical depth of τ ∼πsHn ∼× −(Jewitt and Luu
2000), about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the extrasolar debris disks detected
by Spitzer (>Fig. 9-8, where the fractional luminosity can be approximated by the optical depth,
f = Ldust/Lstar ∼τ – see discussion in >Sect. 2.3.1); this is comparable to the normal optical
depth of the zodiacal dust, τ ∼10−–10−(see > Sect. 1.2.1). Additional evidence of dust-
producing collisions in the KB is the impact craters imaged by the Deep Impact mission on
the surface of the comet Tempe1, thought to be created during the time the comet belonged to
the KB.
The dust production rate estimates in the outer solar system are in the range
(0.2–5) × 10kg/s (from Voyager and Pioneer data, respectively; Jewitt and Luu 2000; Landgraf
et al. 2002). Dust production rates from theoretical models are in the range of (0.1–1)× 10kg/s,
from the erosion of KBO surfaces by the flux of interstellargrains (Yamamoto and Mukai 1998),
to (1–300) × 10, from mutual grain-grain collisions (Stern 1996). For comparison, the dust
production rate in the inner solar system is of the order of 10kg/s (see >Sect. 1.2.1).
Cassini also detected 17 dust impact events between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn (how-
ever, the orientation of the spacecraft was not optimized to maximize the number of detections).
The particles are inferred to have sizes in the submicron to micron range and are found on
bound and unbound orbits. Particles on bound orbits have low eccentricities and low incli-
nations; the shape of the impact signals indicated that the grains are irregular and have high
porosity, as expected from a cometary origin; particles on unbound orbits are inferred to have
sizes of ∼0.4 μm, in agreement with an interstellar origin (Altobelli et al. 2007).

1.2.3 Evolution of the Dust Production Rate in the Solar System
The dust production rate in the solar system has changed significantly with time. It is thought
that the solar system was significantly more dusty in the past because the asteroid and the
Kuiper belts were more densely populated. Evidence for a massive primordial KB is the exis-
tence of KBOs larger than 200 km, which formation by pairwise accretion must have required
a number density of objects about two orders of magnitude higher than today. Evidence for a
massive primordial asteroid belt (AB) comes from the minimum mass solar nebula, showing
a strong depletion in the AB region unlikely to be primordial. The solar system then became
progressively less dusty as the planetesimal belts eroded awayby mutual planetesimal collisions.
Evidence of collisional evolution comes from the modeling and observation of the size distribu-
tion of the asteroids and KBOs (see discussion in >Sect. 2.3.2 and >Fig. 9-25). This collisional
evolution likely resulted in the production of large quantities of dust, as it can be seen in the left
panel of >Fig. 9-5 from a model by Kenyon and Bromley (2005). They found that in a planetes-
imal belt, Pluto-sized bodies ∼1,000 km in size excite the eccentricities of the more abundant
1–10 km sized planetesimals, triggering a collisional cascade that produces dust and changes the
planetesimal size distribution. Because the dust production rate is proportional to the number
of collisions, and this is proportional to the square of the number of planetesimals, as the plan-
etesimals erode and grind down to dust, the dust production rate decreases and the expected
thermal emission from the dust slowly decays with time as /t (see discussion >Sect. 2.3.4).
This decay is punctuated by large spikes that are due to large collisions happening stochastically

from 0.68 to 1.32 AU (dashed line) and 0.4 to 2 AU (solid line). The central star is solar type. Excess
emission decreases as planetesimals grow into Mars-sized or larger objects and collisions become
increasingly rare (From Kenyon and Bromley 2005). (Right): Fraction of stars in a sample of 309 FGK

(left panel of >Fig. 9-5). Examples of stochastic events in the recent history of the solar system
are the fragmentation of the asteroids giving rise to the asteroidal families and the dust bands.
A major change in the dust production rate is expected to have occurred in the early solar
system at the time of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), a period in which a large number
of impact craters in the Moon and the terrestrial planets were created (with an impact rate at
Earth approximately 20,000 × the current value). Because this heavy bombardment deleted all
records of previous impacts, it is not clear whether the LHB was a single event, the tail of a very
heavy bombardment process, or the last of a series of multiple cataclysm (but see Chapman
et al. 2007). This event, dated from lunar samples of impact melt rocks, happened during a
very narrow interval of time 3.8–4.1 Gyr ago (∼600 Myr after the formation of the terrestrial
planets). Thereafter, the impact rate decreased exponentially with a time constant ranging from
10 to 100 Myr (Chyba 1990). Strom et al. (2005) compared the impact cratering record and
inferred crater size distribution on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and Mercury to the size distribution
of different asteroidal populations and found that the LHB lasted ∼20–200 Myr, that the source
of the impactors was the main AB, and that the mechanism was size independent. The most
likely scenario is that the orbital migration of the giant planets caused a resonance sweeping
of the AB and as a result many of the asteroidal orbits became unstable, causing a large-scale
ejection of bodies into planet-crossing orbits (explaining the observed cratering record); the
orbital migration of the planets also caused a major depletion of the KB as Neptune migrated
outward; it is estimated that ∼90% of the KBOs were lost (Gomes et al. 2005). The LHB was
probably a single event in the history of the solar system that would have been accompanied by
a high rate of collisions and dust production (see >Fig. 9-6). After the LHB, there must have
been a sharp decrease in the dust production rate due to the drastic depletion of planetesimal
(Booth et al. 2009).
Some record ofthe interplanetarydust fluxfalling on the Earth can be found in the sedimen-
tary rocks at the sea floor. As mentioned in >Sect. 1.2.1, stellar wind He atoms are implanted
in the voids, bubbles, and crystal defects of interplanetary dust particles. A significant fraction

of the He is lost during atmospheric entry as the particle heats up, but some He survives and
under special conditions can remained trapped for millions of years in sedimentary rocks at
the sea floor (Farley 1995). Extraterrestrial material is associated with high He/He ratios, as
opposed to that of terrestrial origin; the enhanced isotope ratio observed in some of the cores
extracted from the sedimentary rock at the sea floor can be accounted for if approximately
0.5% of the total mass in interplanetary dust suffered little He loss upon atmospheric entry. The
concentration of extraterrestrial material in the sedimentary rock depends on the flux of inter-
planetary dust particles and on the sedimentation rate; for pelagic clays, the concentration is
large because they accumulate slowly. The record of interplanetary dust flux analyzed this way
spans a timescale of 100 Myr (Farley 1995; see summary by Zolensky et al. 2006b), and because
of the effects of atmospheric entry, it favors asteroidal dust in low eccentric orbits. It is found
that: (1) The flux increased by a factor of 5 between 36.5 and 34 Myr ago, coinciding with depo-
sition of Ir, shocked quatz and spinnel (associated with major impacts); the sedimentation rate
at Earth is well known during that time, but the origin of this enhanced interplanetary dust flux,
whether due to asteroidal collisions or to increased cometary activity, is still uncertain. (2) The
flux increased by a factor of 4 between 8.2 ± 0.1 and 6.7 Myr ago; this is likely associated with
the collisional cascade that resulted from the most recent asteroid breakup, the one that gave
rise to the formation of the Veritas asteroidal family 8.3 ± 0.5 Myr ago, thought to be caused by
the breakup of a 150 km size C-type asteroid rich in hydrated minerals; at that time, it proba-
bly constituted the dominant source of (water rich) interplanetary dust at Earth (Dermott et al.
(2002) argued that still contributes to about 25% of the zodiacal dust today, but see Nesvorný
et al. 2010.)
1.3 Extrasolar Debris Disks
The extrapolation of radial velocity studies indicate that ∼17–19% of solar-type stars harbor
giant planets within 20 AU (Marcy et al. 2005). A natural question arises whether stars also har-
bor planetesimals, thought to be the building blocks of planets. Long before extrasolar planets
were discovered, it was inferred that the answer to this question was yes: dust-producing plan-
etesimals had to be responsible for the infrared excesses observed around many mature stars
(see discussion in >Sect. 1.1). These dust disks, first discovered by IRAS (Aumann et al. 1984)
and later studied by ISO (e.g., Habing et al. 2001; Decin et al. 2003), were extensively surveyed
by Spitzer. The goal of the Sptizer surveys was to characterize the frequency and properties of
debris disks around stars of different spectral types, ages, and environment; taking advantage of
the unprecedented sensitivity of the Spitzer/MIPS (24 and 70 μm) and Spitzer/IRS (5–35 μm)
instruments (Rieke et al. 2004; Houck et al. 2004), more than 700 stars were surveyed and hun-
dreds of debris disks were identified. The following is a brief summary of the results from the
Spitzer debris disk surveys.
1.3.1 Debris Disk Frequency
Most of the debris disks detected by Spitzer are found around mature main-sequence stars A to
K2 type, with stellar luminosities ranging from 0.3 to 3 L⊙. >Figure 9-7 summarizes the fre-
quency of debris disks at two different wavelengths in a combined sample of 350 AFGK stars
older than 600 Myr (from Trilling et al. 2008). From Wien’s law, emission peaks at 24 and 70 μm

errors; solidblacksymbols correspond to single starswith excessemission at 24 μm (tracingwarmer
dust), while the solid grey diamonds correspond to excesses at 70 μm (tracing colder dust); empty
symbols are for binary systems (Figure from Trilling et al. (2008)). A diﬀerent survey of 328 solar-
type FGK stars (30 Myr–3 Gyr) found that the frequency of 24 μm excess is 14.7% at <300 Myr and
2% at >300 Myr, while at 70 μm, the excess rates are 6–10% and are fairly independent of age
(Meyer et al. 2008; Hillenbrand et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2009)
would correspond to characteristic dust temperatures of 153 and 52 K, respectively; assuming
1 L⊙, blackbody grains would adopt that temperature if located at 3 AU (24 μm) and 28 AU
(70 μm), while a 10 μm grain in the intermediate size regime would adopt that temperature if
located at 5 AU (24 μm) and 75 AU (70 μm – see ( > 9.15) and ( > 9.16)). >Figure 9-7 shows
that debris disks are more common around A-type stars than around solar-type FGK stars (the
younger age of the A-star sample may bias this result because, as discussed in > Sect. 1.3.2,
debris disks are common around young stars). It is also found that the frequency of debris disks
is significantly higher for solar-type stars than for old M stars. There is a prominent debris disk
around the M star AU Mic, but this star is relatively young (∼12 Myr). In a survey of 64 old
M dwarfs, none of the stars were found to have excesses (Gautier et al. 2007). This may be an
observational bias because the peak emission of these colder disks would be at λ > 70 μm, i.e.,
beyond the wavelength where Spitzer/MIPS was most sensitive. Ongoing debris disk surveys
with Herschel are increasing the number of disk detection rates made by Spitzer, and most of
the new detected debris disks are found around cold late-type stars (Eiroa et al. 2011; Kennedy
et al. in preparation; preliminary results from the Herschel/DEBRISsurvey show debris disk fre-
quencies of 26%, 24%, 19%, 9.5%, and 1.3% around spectra types A, F, G, K, and M, respectively
– Kennedy et al. in preparation).
There is also evidence of the presence of planetesimals around white dwarfs. Some of these
evolved stars show infrared excesses and high levels of pollutants (elements other than the
expected pure H and He), thought to arise from tidally disrupted planetesimals. >Section 1.3.5
discusses how the atmospheric abundances of these white dwarfs provide a unique opportunity

The grey region corresponds to Spitzer data (right) and an estimate based on extrapolation of
these observations (left). The lines correspond to theoretical debris disk distributions assuming
a Gaussian distribution of debris disk fractional luminosities (f) and considering an average frac-
tional luminosity of fave = fSun ∼10−6.5, i.e., similar to that of the solar system’s debris disk (dotted
line); fave = 10 fSun (dashed line); fave = 0.1 fSun (dot-dashed line) (Figure from Bryden et al. (2006))
to study the elemental composition of the disrupted planetesimals. The presence of planetesi-
mals around stars with a very wide range of spectral types, from M-type to the progenitors of
white dwarfs – with several orders of magnitude difference in stellar luminosities – implies that
planetesimal formation is a robust process that can take place under a wide range of conditions.
>Figure 9-8 shows the disk detection frequency from Spitzer surveys, indicating that there
is a steepincrease with decreasing fractional luminosity (f = Ldust/L∗; from Bryden et al. 2006).
Due to the limited sensitivity of the Spitzer debris disk surveys, the detected fractional lumi-
nosities are generally f ≳−; this is larger than those inferred for the solar system’s debris
disk today : f ∼−−−for the inner solar system and f ∼−−−for the outer
solar system (although the latter is only an estimate because its emission is overwhelmed by the
zodiacal dust foreground – see > Sects. 1.2.1 and >1.2.2). >Figure 9-8 compares the obser-
vations to theoretical debris disk distributions: assuming a Gaussian distribution of debris disk
luminosities and extrapolating from Spitzer observations, Bryden et al. (2006) concluded the
fractional luminosity of an average debris disk around a solar-type stars could be between 0.1
and 10 times that of the solar system debris disk. In other words, the observations are con-
sistent with debris disks at the solar system level being common (but they would have been
too faint to be detected by Spitzer). Ongoing debris disk surveys with Herschel (e.g., DUNES
and DEBRIS – Eiroa et al. 2011; Kennedy et al. in preparation) are now probing the frequency
of disk detections for fainter disks. However, recent estimates of the KB dust disk emission by

Dusty Planetary Systems 9
447
Vitense et al. (2012) indicate that, with a fractional luminosity of f ∼−peaking at 40–50 μm,
the dust emission of a KB dust disk analog would be less than 1% the stellar photosphere, still
below the Herschel/PACS detection limits. This means that the detection of KB dust disk analogs
still awaits more sensitive far-infrared space instrumentation (e.g., SPICA/SAFARI).
1.3.2 Debris Disk Evolution
The study of the frequency and properties of debris disks around stars of different ages can shed
light on the evolution of debris disks with time. The main challenge in this case is that the ages
of main-sequence stars, in particular those that are not in clusters, are difficult to determine.
As mentioned in >Sect. 1.2.3 and the left panel of >Fig. 9-5 shows, collisional models predict
that the steady erosion of planetesimals will naturally lead to a decrease in the dust production
rate; this slow decay will be punctuated by short-term episodes of increased activity triggered by
large collisional events that can make the disk look an order of magnitude brighter (see the more
detailed discussion in >Sect. 2.3.4). These models agree broadly with the observations derived
from the Spitzer surveys, as the ones shown in >Fig. 9-9 for A-type and FGK (solar-type) stars.
It is found that the frequency and fractional luminosities (f = Ldust/L∗) of debris disks around
FGK stars with ages in the range 0.01–1 Gyr decline in a timescale of 100–400 Myr, but there is
no clear evidence of a decline in the 1–10 Gyr age range (Trilling et al. 2008). This indicates that
different physical processes might be dominating the evolution of the dust around the younger
and the older systems. A possible scenario is that, at young ages, stochastic dust production due
toindividual collisions is more prominent, while at olderages, the steadygrinding down ofplan-
etesimals dominates. The relative importance of these two processes is still under discussion.
The Spizer surveys also showed that the evolution of dust around both A-type and FGK
stars proceeds differently in the inner and outer regions, with the warmer dust (dominating the
emission at 24 μm) declines faster than the colder dust (seen at 70 μm). This indicates that the
clearing of the disk in the inner regions is more efficient, as would be expected from the shorter
dynamical timescales.

highly processed low carbon P- or D-type asteroid belt located at ∼1 AU, outside the orbit of the
three Neptune-like planets in the system (Lisse et al. 2007); the planets are located at 0.0785AU
(⩾10.2 M⊕), 0.186 AU (⩾11.8 M⊕), and 0.63 AU (⩾18.1 M⊕)
Regarding the issue of steady state versus stochastic dust production, some systems show
evidencethat transient events dominatethe dust production. This is the case of HD 69830, a star
that shows no excess emission at 70 μm, but shows strong excess at 24 μm (HD 69830 is one of
the outliers in the right panel of >Fig. 9-9), with prominent spectral features in the Spizter/IRS
wavelength range (see >Fig. 9-10 – Beichman et al. 2005). The spectral features are indicative
of the presence of large quantities of small warm grains. Because these small grains have very
short lifetimes (see discussion in >Sect. 2.3.1), it is inferred that the level of dust production
is too high to be sustained for the age of the system (because the planetesimals would have not
survived the inferred erosion rate). These led to Wyatt et al. (2007) conclude that the high rate
of dust production in HD 69830, as well as in a few other systems, is transient. HD 69830 is
particularly interesting because it harbors three Neptune-like planets inside 1 AU (Lovis et al.
2006) and the dust is inferred to be located near the 2:1 and 5:2 MMRs of the outermost planet,
so there is the possibility that this transient event is triggered by gravitational perturbations
from the planets. The planet-debris disk connection will be discussed in >Sect. 1.3.4.
The duration of the dust production events (expected to be short if stochastic collisions
dominate, and long otherwise) is critical to estimate what percentage of stars show evidence of
dust production throughout their lives. And this is an important question to address because

Dusty Planetary Systems 9

terrestrial planet formation is expected to result in the production of large quantities of dust
in these regions (observable at 24 μm – see the left panel of >Fig. 9-5), so the percentage of
stars showing excess emission at these wavelengths can shed light on the frequency of planet
formation. The right panel of >Fig. 9-5 shows the evolution of the 24 μm emission as a function
of stellar age. If the dust-producing events are very long-lived, the stars that show dust excesses
in one age bin will also show dust excesses at later times, and this may result in that <20%
of the FGK stars in this survey show evidence of planetesimal formation near the terrestrial
planet region. On the other hand, if the dust-producing events are shorter than the age bins
in the figure, the stars showing excesses in one age bin are not the same as the stars showing
excesses at other age bins, and this might result in that >60% of these stars show evidence of
planetesimal formation (assuming that each star only has one epoch of high dust production).
An additional caveat is that most of these observations are spatially unresolved, and therefore it
is not evident where the 24 μm emission is coming from in the disk; there is the possibility that
the steady erosion of planetesimals in the KB-like region could be contributing to the 24 μm
excess emission, in which case the interpretation in terms of the percentage of stars showing
evidence of planetesimal formation near the terrestrial planet region would change. Surveys of
spatially resolved disks will help clarify this issue.
As it was discussed in >Sect. 1.2.3, there is evidence that the migration of the giant plan-
ets in the early solar system had an important effect on the evolution of its debris disk: the
drastic planetesimal clearing that took place at the time of the LHB, thought to be triggered
by the migration of the planets, would have been associated with a sharp decreased in the dust
production rate in both the AB and the KB (see solid line in >Fig. 9-6). Because the extrapo-
lation of radial velocity studies indicate that ∼17–19% of solar-type stars harbor giant planets
within 20 AU (Marcy et al. 2005), and the presence of hot Jupiters and planets locked in reso-
nances are evidence that planet migration has taken place in some of these planetary systems,
a natural question to ask is whether these drastic planetesimal clearing events are common in
other system. The interest is that frequency and the timing of these LHB-type of events can
have important implications for the habitability of these systems. >Figure 9-6 shows together
the expected evolution of dust in the solar system at two different wavelengths, and the Spitzer
debris disks observations. A statistical study by Booth et al. (2009) concluded that less than 12%
of solar-type star suffered drastic planetesimal clearing events similar to that during the LHB.
This is a preliminary result because, as explained above, the Spitzer surveys were limited in
sensitivity, so this issue needs to be revisited in the future using deeper surveys. In any case, this
result might not be surprising because there is no evidence of a positive correlation between
the presence of debris disks and the presence of giant planets (Greaves et al. 2004; Moro-Martín
et al. 2007a; Bryden et al. 2009; Kóspál et al. 2009), so there is no reason to expect that the debris
disks observed so far should show evidence of planetesimal depletion due to planet migration.
The planet-disk correlation will be discussed in >Sect. 1.3.4.
1.3.3 Debris Disk Structure and Inferred Planetesimal Location
Because most of the debris disks observed so far are located at distances >10 pc from the Sun,
the limited spatial resolution of the instruments leaves them spatially unresolved. Before the
launch of the Herschel infrared telescope (3.5 m in diameter, compared to 0.85 cm for Spitzer),
only a few dozen of the closest and the largest debris disks (out of the hundreds known) were
spatially resolved. The sizes of these disks range from 10s of AU up to 1,000 AU and imply that

450 9

the dust-producing planetesimals are located on spatial scales similar to the KBOs in our solar
system (extending out to ∼50 AU for the classical KB and out to ∼1,000 AU for the scattered
KB). The location of the dust in the disks that are spatially unresolved can still be constrained
or inferred. Because different wavelengths trace different dust temperatures and distances from
the central star, the study of the debris disk SED can shed light on the radial distribution of
the dust: for example, a disk with a central cavity where the warmer dust is absent would have
an SED showing a depletion in the mid-IR wavelength region. In fact, the SEDs of the unre-
solved debris disks show evidence of central cavities, with characteristic dust temperatures in
the range of 50–150 K, corresponding to dust located in the 10s–100 AU range. This result may
be biased because of the limited sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the Spitzer observations.
Ongoing debris disk surveys with Herschel are quickly increasing the number of resolved disks
and/or providing better constraints for their outer radii with the help of more sensitive longer
wavelength observations.
Inner Gaps
From a Spitzer survey of 328 FGK stars at 24 and 70 μm, it was found that about two third of the
debris disk SEDs could be fitted with a single temperature blackbody (T < 45–85 K) consistent
with a ring-like configuration, while the rest would require either multiple rings or a continuous
distribution of dust out to tens of AU (Hillenbrand et al. 2008). Detailed analysis of the excess
spectra from 12 to 35 μm of 44 of these stars showed that the characteristic dust temperature in
these disks ranges from 60 to 180 K, that a cold component is needed to account for the 70 μm
excess, and that inner disk cavities are common; the inner radii of these cavities are ∼40 AU for
the disks with 70 μm excess and ∼10 AU forthe disks without 70 μm excess (see >Fig. 9-11 from
Carpenter et al. 2009). Because these dust disks are in a regime where the dynamics of the dust
particles are mostly controlled by collisions (see discussion in >Sect. 2.3.3), and therefore the
dust traces the location of the planetesimals, these results indicate that most of the planetesimals
inferred to exist around mature FGK (solar-type) stars are KB like (in the sense that they have
large inner cavities – the inner radius of the KB is ∼35 AU).
Inner cavities are also common around more massive stars: a Spitzer survey of 52 A-type and
late B-type stars known to have debris disks showed that the majority of the disks (39/52) can be
fitted with a single-temperature blackbody with a median temperature of 190 K, corresponding
to a characteristic distance of 10 AU, while the rest (13/52) are better fitted by extended disks
without cavities (Morales et al. 2009).
The presence of inner cavities has been confirmed by spatially resolved observations of
nearby debris disks in both scattered light, as, e.g., in HR 4796A, Fomalhaut and HD 139664,
and in thermal millimeter and submillimeteremission, as, e.g., in є-Eri, Vega, and η Corvi (with
inner cavities of 50, 80, and 100 AU, respectively).
Degeneracy of the SED Analysis
The analysis of the debris disk SEDs in terms of the dust location depends on assumptions on
how efficiently the grains absorb and reemit the stellar radiation, because it is this balance that
determines their equilibrium temperature. This in turn depends on the grain size and com-
position, which ideally can be constrained through the modeling of the solid-state features in
the debris disk spectra. The issue is that most debris disks observed so far do not have any
features in the 5–35 μm wavelength range covered by Spitzer/IRS (see in >Sect. 1.3.5) where
they show a smooth blackbody continuum (Chen et al. 2006; Beichman et al. 2006; Carpenter
et al. 2009; Morales et al. 2009). It is generally assumed that this is because the grains have sizes

et al. 2009)
≳10 μm (a grain size commonly adopted in the SED analysis). Regarding the grain composi-
tion, a common assumption is that they are made of “astronomical silicates” (i.e., silicates with
optical constants from Weingartner and Draine 2001). However, the laboratory analysis of dust
particles from the solar system (IDPs and Stardust returned samples – >Sect. 1.2.1) and the
analysis of debris disks with spectral features, like HD 69830 (> Fig. 9-10 and >Sect. 1.3.5),
indicate that this assumption might be too simplistic. Another caveat is that the debris disk
SEDs are generally not constrained at the long wavelength range and most of them have only
upper limits beyond 70 μm. As a result, the cold dust remains undetected and the outer disk
radii unconstrained. Ongoing observations with Herschel, with increased sensitivity at longer
wavelengths, are now contributing to characterize the cold dust. In fact, Herschel has detected a
“new class” of very cold (∼20 K) and faint (f ∼−) debris disks that only show dust emission
beyond 100 or 160 μm (Eiroa et al. 2011).

eled SEDs, while the allowed parameter space is shown right below. If the system is known to
harbor planets (like in this case), an additional constraint on the dust location can be obtained

of the planetesimals’ orbits and that can identify the regions where the planetesimals could be
stable and long-lived (see right panels of >Fig. 9-12). >Figure 9-21 shows a similar dynam-

case, it is found that the effect of the secular perturbations is very long-ranged (extending to
55 AU compared to the 3.74 AU semimajor axis of the outermost planet) and constrains the
dust-producing planetesimals to the 20–50 AU region (resembling the KB).

the systems known to date to harbor both multiple planets and debris dust (from Moro-Martín
et al. 2010). For most of the stars, the study is based on a combined SED and dynamical anal-
ysis (similar to that in >Fig. 9-12). The solutions are degenerate; to set tighter constraints on
the planetesimal location, there is the need to obtain spatially resolved images and/or accurate
photometric points from the mid-infrared to the submillimeter, so the inner and outer radius of
the disk can be better determined. Observations with Herschel, JWST, and ALMA will be very
valuable for this purpose.
Other Structural Features Revealed by Spatially Resolved Observations
The few dozen debris disks that have been spatially resolved so far show a rich diversity of struc-
tural features (> Fig. 9-3); Kalas et al. (2006) identified two basic architectures, either narrow
belts about 20–30 AU wide and with well-defined outer boundaries (e.g., HR 4796A, Foma-
lhaut, and HD 139664), or wide belts with sensitivity limited edges implying widths >50 AU
(HD 32297, β-Pic, AU Mic, HD 107146, and HD 53143). Structural features include clumpy
rings (like in AU Mic, β-Pic, ε-Eri, and Fomalhaut), sharp inner edges (Fomalhaut), bright-
ness asymmetries (β-Pic, AU Mic, HR 4796, HD 32297, Fomalhaut, and Vega), offsets of the
dust disk center with respect to the central star (Fomalhaut and ε-Eri, with offsets of 15 AU and
6.6–16.6 AU, respectively), warps of the disk plane (like β-Pic and AU Mic), and spirals (HD
141569 – Wyatt et al. 1999; Heap et al. 2000; Clampin et al. 2003; Holland et al. 2003; Stapelfeldt
et al. 2004; Kalas et al. 2005; Greaves et al. 2005; Schneider et al. 2005; Krist et al. 2005). Some of
these features have also been observed in the solar system debris disk: the zodiacal cloud shows
a warp in its plane of symmetry and an asymmetric ring near the Earth’s orbit, and dynami-
cal models of the KB dust disk predict an inner cavity around 10 AU, and an asymmetric ring
outside the orbit of Neptune (see >Fig. 9-19 and discussion in > Sects. 1.2.1 and >2.2).
These spatially resolved observations show that the disks look different at different wave-
lengths because at a given wavelength, the thermal emission is dominated by a particular grain
size, and grains of different sizes have different dynamical evolutions that result in different
structural features. As it is discussed in more detail in Part II, large particles that dominate
the emission at longer wavelengths show more structural features because they interact more
weakly with the stellar radiation field and therefore their dynamical evolution is slow; in this
case, the particles trace the location of their parent planetesimals, or if planets are present, they
can also be subject to resonant trapping. On the other hand, small grains that dominate the
emission at shorter wavelengths interact more strongly with radiation, which results in a more
uniform and extendeddisk. This can clearly be observed in the case of Vega (>Fig. 9-14). >Sec-
tion 1.3.3 discussed the need for spatially resolved observations to break the degeneracy in the
debris disk SED analysis; the above discussion indicates that these resolved observations need
to be taken at multiwavelengths.
Debris Disk Structure Can Unveil the Presence of Planets
Secular perturbations by Saturn are responsible for the creation of the inner edge of the aster-
oid belt around 2 AU, while other secular perturbations are thought to account for the offset
of the zodiacal cloud center with respect to the Sun, the inclination of the cloud with respect
to the ecliptic and the cloud warp; in addition, the trapping of dust particles in MMRs with
the Earth is responsible for the asymmetric ring of dust along the Earth’s orbit ( >Sect. 1.2.1).
In light of these observations, a natural question arises: are the structural features observed in
debris disks the result of gravitational perturbations with unseen planets? Clumpy rings have
been explained as dust and/or dust-producing planetesimals trapped in MMRs with a planet;

⊡Fig. 9-14
Spatially resolved images of Vega from Spitzer/MIPS at 24, 70, and 160 μm (Su et al. 2005) and
from JCMT/SCUBA at 850 μm (Holland et al. 1998). All images are in the same scale. The instrument
beam sizes (shown in white circles) indicate that the wide radial extent of the MIPS disk images
compared to the SCUBA disk image is not a consequence of the instrumental PSF but due to a
diﬀerent spatial location of the particles traced by the two instruments. This indicates the need for
spatially resolved observations at diﬀerent wavelengths. The submillimeter emission is thought to
arise from large dust particles on bound orbits that originate from a planetesimal belt analogous
to the KB, while the MIPS emission is thought to correspond to smaller particles on unbound orbits
produced by collisions in the planetesimal belt traced by the submillimeter observations; these
particles are blown away by radiation pressure to distances much larger than the location of the
parent bodies; this scenario would explain not only the wider extent of the MIPS disk but also its
uniform distribution, in contrast with the clumply and more compact submillimeter disk (Su et al.
2005; cf. to Müller et al. 2010 that interpret the observations with a collisional cascade in steady
state)
warps can be the result of secular perturbations of a planet in an orbit inclined with respect to
the planetesimal/dust disk; and spirals, offsets, and brightness asymmetries might also be the
result of secular perturbations, in this case of an eccentric planet that forces an eccentricity on
the planetesimals and the dust. Even though the origin of individual features is still under dis-
cussion,1 and the models require further refinements – e.g., in the inclusion of dust collisional
processes (Stark and Kuchner 2009) and the effects of gas drag – the complexity of these fea-
tures, in particular the azimuthal asymmetries, indicates that planets likely play a role in the
creation of structure in the debris disks.
The Fomalhaut case illustrates this idea: a massive planet was predicted to exist to account
for both the sharp inner edge observed in the dust disk (created by gravitational scattering) and
the offset of the dust disk center (created by secular perturbations – Wyatt et al. 1999; Kalas et al.
2005; Quillen 2006). Later on, follow-up observations were able to directly image a planet can-
didate around the predicted semimajor axis, where the planet eccentricity could be constrained
1It is possible that some of these disk features are created by mechanism other than planets. For example,
clumps could trace the location of a recent planetesimal collision, instead of the location of dust-producing
planetesimals or dust particles trapped in MMRs with a planet. Azimuthal asymmetries and spirals could be
created by binary companions or close stellar flybys, but the later involves fine tuning to create the pertur-
bations without destroying the disk. Brightness asymmetries on the outermost edge of the disk could also be
created by sandblasting from interstellar grains. The interaction of the dust with remnant gas, stellar wind, or
magnetic fields could also be responsible for some of the structure. Even though it is possible that some of the
disk features are created by mechanism other than planets, it seems unlikely that non-planet mechanism can
account for all the debris disk structures observed.

from the offset of the dust disk (Kalas et al. 2008). Because the eccentricity of the dust parti-
cles at the edge of the chaotic region where the MMRs overlap depends on the planet mass,
the radial distribution of the dust near the inner edge of the dust disk can set limits on the
mass of the planet (Chiang et al. 2009). This is particularly interesting because in some sys-
tems, a dynamical constraint for the planet mass can be compared to the mass estimate based
on the observed luminosity, with the advantage that the former is independent of the planet age
(which in most cases is difficult to estimate) and the initial conditions of the planet evolution-
ary model. In these systems, a dynamical constraint can be used to test and calibrate current
evolutionary models of giant planets; this is important because, in most cases, dynamical con-
strains are not available and the planet masses need to be derived from evolutionary models
alone.
Another example of a planet successfully predicted to exist based on the debris disk struc-
ture is β-Pic b (Mouillet et al. 1997; Lagrange et al. 2010): with an estimated mass of ∼9 MJup,
this planet located at 8–14 AU can account for some of the asymmetries observed in the
debris disk, including its inner warp. This system is particularly relevant because the planet
has a relative short orbit that will allow to constrain the mass with the radial velocity tech-
nique, enabling the much needed calibration of the planet evolutionary models at young ages
(∼10 Myr).
The connection between planets and inner cavities is under debate. The gravitational
scattering of dust particles by planets is a very efficient process that can create a dust-depleted
region inside the orbit of the planet (see discussion in
> Sects. 2.2.2 and
> 2.2.4 and
> Figs. 9-19, > 9-20, > 9-22). But some of the observed inner cavities might be the result
of grain-grain collisions rather than gravitational scattering with a planet; however, this latter
scenario assumes that the parent bodies have an inner edge to their spatial distribution which
may require planets to be present to keep the planetesimals confined. Core accretion models of
planet formation predict the formation of inner cavities because the planets form faster closer
to the star, depleting planetesimals from the inner disk regions.
Most of the structural features discussed in >Sect. 2.2 depend on the mass and orbit of the
planet. The case of the solar system illustrates that the structure is sensitive to small planets (like
the Earth) and to planets located far from the star (like Neptune). This opens the possibility of
using the study of the dust disk structure as a detection technique for planets of a wide range
of masses and semimajor axes. This method is complementary to radial velocity and transit
surveys (limited to planets relatively close to the star) and to direct imaging (limited to young
and massive planets).
1.3.4 Planet-Debris Disk Relation
In the core accretion models of planet formation, planetesimals are the building blocks of plan-
ets; in these models, giant planet formation requires the presence of a protoplanetary disk rich
in planetesimals, which would favor a positive correlation between the presence of giant planets
and debris disks. However, as it was discussed in >Sect. 1.2.3, the migration of giant planets
can lead to drastic planetesimal clearing events, as the one expected to have occurred during
the LHB in the early solar system; this would favor an anticorrelation between giant planets and
debris disks.
Spitzer debris disk surveys do not find any sign of positive or negative correlation between
the presence of giant planets identified in radial velocity surveys and the presence of debris disks

Dusty Planetary Systems 9
457
(Moro-Martín et al. 2007a; Bryden et al. 2009; Kóspál et al. 2009), i.e., there is no apparent
difference between the incidence rate of debris disks around stars with and without known
planetary companions.
A scenario that could account for this lack of correlation is the following. Spitzer obser-
vations are sensitivity limited and can only detect the brighter disks; based on the observed
distribution of fractional luminosities, it seems likely that debris disks at the solar system level
are very common, i.e., that many stars harbor planetesimals (see discussion in >Sect. 1.3.1).
Debris disks are found around stars with a wide range of spectra types, indicating that the plan-
etesimal formation process is very robust and can take place under a wide range of conditions.
This is also in agreement with the observation that the presence of debris disks is not correlated
with high stellar metallicities (Greaves et al. 2006). Giant planets, on the other hand, are strongly
correlated with high stellar metallicities (because their formation may require the presence of
a large surface density of solids in the disk, so that the planet can grow a core sufficiently large
to accrete an atmosphere before the gas disk disappears – Fischer and Valenti 2005). All this
indicates that the conditions required to form planetesimals are more easily met than those to
form giant planets, planetesimals are more common, and massive planets may not be required
to produce the debris dust. In a possible scenario for the production of debris at Gyr ages, even
in a disk that is too low in solids to form a giant planet, a large 1,000 km size planetesimals can
stir up smaller planetesimals (0.1–10 km in size) along their orbits, starting a collisional cascade
that can produce dust excess emission over the relevant range of ages. Results from numerical
models exploring this scenario are shown in >Fig. 9-15.
The planet-debris disk relation will be revisited with the Herschel DEBRIS and DUNES
surveys, sensitive to lower-mass debris disks and to disks around colder stars.
The increasing population of super-Earths discovered by the radial velocity surveys will
soon allow to test whether there is a correlation between the presence of low-mass planets
(<10 MEarth) and the presence of debris disks. Contrarily to high-mass planets, recent results
from the radial velocity surveys indicate that there is no correlation between high metallici-
ties and low-mass planets (Mayor et al. 2011). This might indicate that the conditions to form

low-mass planets are more easily met than those to form high-mass planets and, therefore, there
could be a correlation between low-mass planets and debris disks. At the time of the Spitzer
planet-debris disk correlation studies, little was known about the frequency of low-mass plan-
ets and only a handful of these objects were known. Now that many more low-mass planet
systems have been identified, and given that the Herschel surveys include low-mass planet host
stars, it has became possible to explore whether a low-mass planet-debris correlation exists, as
hinted by the metallicity studies.
Of particular interest is whether the presence of terrestrial planets might be correlated with
debris dust. It is well known that the future detection and characterization of terrestrial plan-
ets in extrasolar planetary systems might be compromised by the emission from their inner
debris disks (the equivalent to the zodiacal cloud). This means that stars with evidence of warm
dust are not good candidates for terrestrial planet searches. On the other hand, a study by Ray-
mond et al. (2011, 2012) indicates that stars with evidence of cold dust might turn out to be
good targets. This study is based on numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of about
400 different planetary systems, each consisting on three giant planets, two belts of planetes-
imals (inner and outer), and a population of Mars-sized embryos in the inner belt (that can
grow into terrestrial planets). The simulations are able to reproduce the observed distribution
of giant planet eccentricities. The ensemble of models by Raymond et al. (2011, 2012) show that
(1) 40–70% of the systems that become unstable destroy their terrestrial planets; in these cases,
the giant planet instability is too strong and the embryos are thrown into the star or ejected from
the system. (2) The terrestrial planet outcome correlates with the eccentricity of the surviving
giant planets; higher eccentricities imply that the instability was more violent and therefore the
terrestrial planets were likely destroyed, while lower eccentricities indicate that more terrestrial
planets survive. And (3) there is a strong correlation between the presence of bright cold dust
and the occurrence of terrestrial planets (> Fig. 9-16; Raymond et al. 2011, 2012); cold debris
disks trace terrestrial planets because dusty systems mean a calm dynamical evolution where
terrestrial planets are able to grow and survive.2
Finally, the recent release of the all-sky near- to mid-infrared survey carried out by the WISE
space telescope, together with ground-based observations, may soon allow to assess whether
there is a correlation between the presence of planets and the presence of warm dust (that may
hint dynamical activity in the terrestrial planet region).
1.3.5 Debris Disk Composition
Spitzer/IRS carried out spectral surveys of debris disks around star from A to K type in the
5–35 μm wavelength range. Even though silicate emission features should be prominent around
10–20 μm, the spectra of most debris disks do not show any features, so little is known about
the composition of the dust. In total, about two dozen disks show spectral features in this wave-
length range; they are generally young stars (<50 Myr), and the majority of them show evidence
of warm crystalline silicates and multiple planetesimal belts (with a warm component respon-
sible for the spectral features, and a cold component that accounts for the emission at longer
2In this context, the solar system is an outlier because it harbors four terrestrial planets but very little dust.
The explanation might be that the instability in the solar system was sufficiently strong to clear out the
planetesimals, but sufficiently weak not to affect the stability of the terrestrial planets.

sity of compositions and degree of crystallinity (related to the processing history) for stars of
similar spectral types, even those of similar ages.
The lack of spectral features in the majority of the disks indicates that the dust grains are
either large and/or cold (T < K). Grains with sizes s > λ/2π tend to absorb and emit energy
efficiently with a constant emissivity (i.e., with no spectral features), so the lack of features at
λ < 35 μm implies grain sizes s > 5.5 μm. For debris disks around A-type stars, radiation pres-
sure can account for the lack of grain smaller than this size because the median blowout size for
the stars in the A star sample is ∼4.7 μm (see discussion on the blowout size in >Sect. 2.1.4).
For solar-type stars, the blowout size is ∼1 μm, so small grains are expected to be present and
should produce spectral features if they are warm. In fact, the two systems found with excess
emission at λ < 25 μm, i.e., with warm dust, show spectral features at 7–20 μm.
One of these two systems is HD 69830 (> Fig. 9-10). This mature K0 star, several Gyr old,
harbors three close-in Neptune-like planets and shows no excess emission at 70 μm (i.e., no
evidence of cold dust), a strong excess at 24 μm (corresponding to 1,000 × the emission of
the zodiacal cloud), and its spectra are dominated by strong silicate features that can be fit-
ted with 80% Mg-rich olivines (25% of which is amorphous) and 20% crystalline pyroxenes

(Beichman et al. 2005). At first sight, the spectrum is very similar to that of comet Hale-Bopp,
but further analysis reveals it differs from cometary spectra (because there is no evidence for
water gas, amorphous carbon, amorphous pyroxene, PAHs, phyllosilicates, and metallic sul-
fides); the best fit is to the dust produced by a highly processed low carbon P- or D-type asteroid
(Lisse et al. 2007). These asteroids are the most common in the outer asteroid belt, and the
breakup of these type of objects gave rise to the Veritas and Karin asteroidal families in events
that should have been important sources of dust (see discussion in >Sect. 1.2.1). The dust pro-
duction in HD 69830 is also thought to be transient because the rate that would be needed to
account for the observed amount of dust is too high to be sustain for the age of the star (Wyatt
et al. 2007 – see discussion in >Sect. 1.3.2). It is likely that the strong silicate features observed
are associated with collision/disruption events, and in the case of HD 69830, the spectra reveal
that the composition of the parent body was similar to that of an asteroid. It is inferred that
the dust around this planet-bearing star is located at 0.93–1.16 AU, near the 2:1 and 5:2 MMRs
of the outermost Neptune-like planet, raising the question whether the increased level of dust
production is the result of gravitational perturbations by the planets.
The “colors” of the debris disks (obtained from scattered-light images taken at different
wavelengths) can also provide some information about their composition. Debris disks tend
to be red or neutral, with their redness commonly explained by the presence of small (∼0.4 μm)
silicate grains. However, spatially resolved spectra have shown that debris disks do not gener-
ally contain large amounts of small silicate grains, in which case it must be the composition of
the grains that makes them look intrinsically red. The red color of the debris disks around HR
4796A, an A0V star 8 Myr old, has been identified as a signature of tholins, the complex organic
materials found in the surface of icy bodies and in the atmosphere of Titan; however, other fits
to the data consist in porous grains made of amorphous silicates, amorphous carbon, and water
ice (Debes et al. 2008). Higher resolution spectroscopy (spatially resolved) is required to further
constrain the models.
The study of the atmospheric composition of some white dwarfs provides a unique oppor-
tunity to probe the elemental composition of planetesimals in these systems. About one fifth of
white dwarfs expected to have pure hydrogen or pure helium atmospheres (due to quick sedi-
mentation of the heavy elements under the effect of the strong gravitational field) show evidence
for heavier elements, likely due to pollution from external sources. In the case of white dwarfs
that show atmospheric pollutants and near-infrared excesses, where the latter is inferred to be
produced by dust located inside the tidal radius of the star, it is likely that the source of the
pollutants is this circumstellar dust. This is favored over an interstellar origin based on sev-
eral observations: the spectra of some of these infrared excesses show a strong 10 μm silicate
feature with a shape that resembles that observed in the zodiacal cloud and differs from the
characteristic interstellar dust emission, and an observed depletion of carbon relative to iron
in the atmospheric composition of the white dwarf also suggests that the infalling material is
asteroid like rather than interstellar(Jura 2006). Detailed observations of the atmospheric com-
position of one of the white dwarfs (GD 362) reveal that the relative enhancement of refractory
elements and the relative depletion of volatiles are similar to that found in the Earth (Jura et al.
2007). All this favors a scenario in which tidally disrupted3 asteroid-like bodies are responsible
for the near-infrared excess emission and the atmospheric pollution. The advantage of using
3During the stellar evolution leading to the white dwarf stage, there is a significant mass loss from the star. As
a result, the semimajor axes of orbiting bodies increase, and this may lead to dynamical instabilities caused by
resonance sweeping and other effects that may send asteroid-like bodies into the tidal radius of the star.

this method to assess the composition of these asteroid-like bodies is that, since the material
has already been broken into its elemental composition, the results do not depend on unknown
dust grain properties.
1.4 Future Prospects in Debris Disks Studies
The discovery of debris disks in 1984, a decade before the detection of extrasolar planets around
main-sequence stars, provided the first evidence that a critical step in the process of planet
formation (the formation of planetesimals) is taking place around other stars. Since then, our
knowledge of debris disks has greatly improved, and this chapter has described how it has shed
light on the formation, evolution, and diversity of planetary systems. Debris disk observations
with Herschel (ongoing), with upcoming observatories like ALMA and JWST (under develop-
ment), and with future missions like SPICA (proposed), together with new developments in
planet-detection techniques, warrant that the field of debris disk studies will keep developing
rapidly, enabled not only by the improved sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution of the
observations but also by the interest of the astronomical community. The latter is reflected in
the Astro2010 “Decadal Survey”4 by the National Academies (2010–2010) and the “Cosmic
Visions” byESA(2015–2025), where questions intimatelyrelated todebris disks have been iden-
tified as priorities for the next decade, namely, how do circumstellar disks form and evolve into
planetary systems? What is the diversity of planetary systems? How does it depend on stellar
properties? How does the solar system fit in the context of other planetary systems? Is the solar
system unique in its formation, characteristics, and/or evolution? What is the composition of
primitive planetesimals in the solar system? Is there a radial gradient? What is the frequency of
stars with terrestrial planets? Which stars are the best candidates for planet detection? Do they
harbor debris disks bright enough to impede planet detection and characterization? To advance
in answering some of these question, the Astro2010 “Decadal Survey” made the following spe-
cific recommendations related to debris disks: (1) To carry out debris disk surveys around stars
of different ages and spectral types; the goals are the characterization of the disk properties as a
function of the stellar properties, the determination of the necessary conditions for the forma-
tion of planetesimals, and the study of the temporal evolution of the systems. (2) Study of debris
disk structure with high spatial resolution observations in scattered light (optical–near infrared),
in thermal emission (mid-infrared–submillimeter), and at different epochs (to allow the detec-
tion of proper motions and to exclude features that might be background galaxies); the goals
are to identify morphological features that can reveal the presence of planets (allowing to con-
strain their mass, eccentricity, and period) and can shed light on the dynamical evolution of
the system. (3) Development of theoretical debris disk models (including planet-disk interactions
and collisions), with the goal of interpreting high spatial resolution observations. (4) Direct
detection of planets in protoplanetary and debris disks, with the goal of studying the planet-disk
interaction. (5) To carry out KBOs surveys to constrain their size distribution, physical proper-
ties (which depend on the size of the body), and their collisional state, with the goal of shedding
light on the formation and dynamical evolution of the solar system.
Examples of these studies are the ongoing Hershel surveys DUNES and DEBRIS designed to
search for debris disks around AFGKM stars at 70, 100, and 160 μm, with follow-up at 350, 450,
and 500 μm; these observations are already allowing to characterize a new population of cold

disks (Eiroa et al. 2011) and to increase the number of spatially resolved observations (Booth
et al. in preparation). ALMA’s unprecedented high spatial resolution will be able to advance
in the study of debris disk structure and to test the models of planet-disk interactions; its long
wavelength observations will allow to better constrain the disks outer radii. Debris disk surveys
with JWST in the near- to mid-infrared will allow to characterize the warm dust component,
setting constrains on the frequency of planetesimal formation in the terrestrial planet region,
and identifying stars with low debris dust contamination that may be good targets for terrestrial
planet detection. Deep debris disk surveys with JWST and SPICA (the approval of the latter
is pending) will be able to study the debris disk evolution and the dust production rate as a
function of stellar age; this will help identify systems undergoing LHB-type of events and to
assesswhether the dynamical evolution of the solar system was particularly benign (in the sense
that it did not affect the orbital stability of the terrestrial planets and it happened early during
the solar system evolution). The SAFARI instrument planned for SPICA (a proposed telescope
similar to Herschel but cool down to 5 K allowing a greatly improved sensitivity), covering the
wavelength range of 30–210 μm, has debris disks at one of its focus. In fact, three out of its
eight proposed core programs are related to debris disk studies, namely, (1) the study of the
occurrence and mass of debris disks (carrying out an unbiased survey of all stellar types out to a
few hundred pc), (2)the studyofthe dust mineralogyin debris disks (doing an spectral surveyof
debris disks and, for nearby disks, spectral imaging), and (3) the study of the composition of the
KB (with an unbiased survey of KBOs). Of special interest is that, for the nearby debris disks, it
will be possible to trace the variation in the dust mineral content as a function of disk radius that
can be compared to the compositional gradient in the solar system. Regarding the solar system,
advancements need to be made in the study of the dust-producing planetesimals, e.g., with
KBO surveys with Pan-STARRS, LSST, and Subaru-HSC, and in the study of the solar system’s
dust (which properties in the outer solar system are greatly unknown). For the latter, there are
several space missions proposed, including sample return missions to an asteroid and a comet,
dust detection experiments, and the study of the dust scattered light using a small telescope on
board a spacecraft traveling into the outer solar system. Finally, there are programs to detect
planets in stars harboring debris disks using ground-based telescopes (e.g., Subaru/HiCIAO,
Gemini/GPI, and VLT/SPHERE) that will allow to study the planet-disk interaction.
These are some of the future research lines in debris disk studies that will help us understand
our solar system in the context of the wide diversity of planetary systems: debris disks allow us
to “see worlds in grains of sand”5.

Part II: Physical Processes Acting on Dust
Part II reviews the dominant physical processes acting on dust particles and their effect of the
particle size and spatial distribution, focussing on radiation and stellarwind forces ( >Sect. 2.1),
gravitational forces in the presence of planets ( > Sect. 2.2), and collisions ( > Sect. 2.3).
The discussion applies the gas-free environment of the solar system’s interplanetary space and
extrasolar debris disks. There are many reviews on this topic, e.g., Mukai et al. (2001), Gustafson
et al. (2001), Dermott et al. (2001), Wyatt (2008a), and Krivov (2010).

2.1 Radiation and Stellar Wind Forces
2.1.1 Radiation Pressure
If the circumstellar dust particle is at rest, the radiation pressure force exerted by the stellar
photons on the particle is given by Frad =
S
hν
hν
c QprA, where S
hν is the flux of incoming photons,
hν
c is the momentum per photon, and QprA is the particle cross-section for radiation pressure;
A is the particle geometric cross-section (A = πs) and Qpr is the dimensionless radiation pres-
sure factor averaged over the stellar spectrum; Qpr is a function of the grain optical properties,
size, shape, and chemical composition and a measure of the fractional amount of energy scat-
tered and/or absorbed by the grain. Substituting the energy flux density S =
L∗
πr, one gets that
Frad = L∗Qprs
rc , where L∗is the stellar luminosity, s is the particle radius, and r is the heliocentric
distance (Burns et al. 1979). Because the radiation pressure force has the same dependency on
r as the gravitational force, Fgrav = GM∗m
r
, it is useful to define the dimensionless parameter β,
given by
β = Frad
Fgrav

(9.1)
where Qpr is the radiation pressure factor averaged over the stellar spectrum.

Grain radii are given in μm. Particles are assume to be spherical, with bulk densities in g cm−3 of 2.71 (MgSiO3), 3.1
(Mg0.6Fe0.4SiO3), 3.71 (MgFeSiO4), 3.3 (Mg1.9Fe0.1SiO4 – crystalline olivine), 1.435 (C 400), and 1.988 (C1000) (From
Moro-Martín et al. 2005)
If the grains are highly nonspherical or have significant porosity (as might be expected
for aggregates of smaller grains that result naturally from grain growth via coagulation – see,
e.g., >Fig. 9-4), their increased surface and decreased bulk density will result on an increased
value of β (with respect to that of spherical grains).
2.1.2 Poynting-Robertson Drag
If the circumstellar particle is moving with respect to the central star, it experiences a force
given by
μ dr
dt= SAQpr
c
[(−˙r
c ) ˆS −v
c ]
(9.2)
(to terms of order v/c), where r and v are the particle position and velocity with respect to the
central star, ˆS is the unit vector in the direction of the incident radiation (ˆS = r/r), and μ is the
particle mass. The radial term
SAQpr
c
(−˙r
c ) ˆS is the radiation pressure force with the added
factor (−˙r
c ) to account for the Doppler effect, while the velocity-dependent term, SAQpr
c
v
c , is
known as the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag. The latter is a relativistic effect that can be intu-
itively explained in the following way: in the reference frame of the particle, the stellar radiation
appears tocome at a small angle forward from the radial direction (due tothe aberration oflight)
that results in a force with a component against the direction of motion; in the reference frame
of the star, the radiation appears to come from the radial direction, but the particle reemits
more momentum into the forward direction due to the photons blueshifted by the Doppler
effect, resulting in a drag force (Burns et al. 1979). Using β in ( > 9.1), the equation of motion
becomes

2.1.3 Stellar Wind Forces
Radiation pressure and P-R drag arise from the transfer of momentum between the photons and
the dust particle. Similarly, the dust grain interacts with the stellar wind particles giving rise to
a corpuscular pressure force and a corpuscular drag force; these forces depend on the stellar
wind properties (mass-loss, relative velocity between the stellar wind and the dust particle, and
molecular weight) and on how efficiently the stellar wind particles interact with the dust grain.
In the solar system, the solar wind carries a momentum flux that is on average about 2 ⋅10−
times the momentum flux carried by radiation, and therefore the corpuscular pressure force
can be neglected. On the contrary, the corpuscular drag force is about 35% of the P-R drag
force (Gustafson 1994); its increased significance in this case is due to the slower velocity of
the solar wind compared to the speed of light which, in the frame of the particle, increases the
aberration angle and therefore the component of the force against the direction of motion; the
aberration angle of the stellar wind particles is arctan(v/vsw) compared to arctan(v/c) for the
stellar photos, where v and vsw are the velocity of the particle and stellar wind, respectively
(Burns et al. 1979). Defining the ratio of the solar wind drag to the P-R drag as sw, the equation
of motion becomes
dr
dt= −GM∗(−β)
r
r −(+ sw)β

GM∗

[( ˙r

(9.4)
For the solar system, sw = 0.35 (Gustafson 1994); for M-type stars, the contribution of the cor-
puscular drag force could be significantly more important because of the increased mass-loss
rate and low stellar luminosities (Plavchan et al. 2005).
2.1.4 Eﬀect of Radiation Forces on the Dust Dynamics
As soon as the dust particle is released from its parent body and begins to be subject to radiation
forces, its equation of motion changes from that of the parent body, dr
dt= −GM∗
r
r, to ( >9.3) (or
( >9.4) if considering stellar wind forces), resulting in a change of the particle orbital elements
(Burns et al. 1979). The degree of change will depend on the β-value of the particle (the ratio
of the radiation force to the gravitational force acting on the particle). >Figure 9-17 shows that
for very large and very small grains β →; therefore, particles in this size range are unaffected
by radiation forces. Intermediate-sized particles might be blown out from the system if their
specific orbital energy becomes positive, i.e.,

where v is the particle velocity and a its semimajor axis. If the particle is released at perihelion,

. Radiation pressure blowout is very fast, with a timescale similar
to the orbital period, tblow = 

years. Because β depends on the particle size, e.g.,
for the solar system β = .⋅−(
Qpr
ρs ), the condition above sets up a lower limit for the size of
a particle on a bound orbit. In the solar system, the particles smaller than the blowout size are
known as “β-meteoroids” (Zook and Berg 1975); these small grains, of asteroidal or cometary
origin, are escaping from the solarsystem on hyperbolicorbits as the result ofradiation pressure;

466 9
Dusty Planetary Systems
they have been inferred to exist from the lunar microcrater record and from in situ detections
on board spacecraft (Grün et al. 1994).
The orbital energy of dust particles with β ≤(±e)

, i.e., with sizes larger than the blowout
size, will stay negative after release, and therefore these particles will remain on bound orbits;
because the dust particle and its parent body are effectively moving under different gravitational
potentials, their orbital elements will differ (this is because the particle “feels” a stellar mass
reduced by the factor (1–β) (Burns et al. 1979). The position and velocity of the parent body
and the dust particle are the same at release,

(9.8)
(where a and e are the parent body semimajor axis and eccentricity). The particle inclination
remains the same as that of its parent body because radiation pressure is a radial force.
Radiation and stellar wind forces not only change the orbital elements of the dust particles
upon release but also affect their evolution with time. The drag forces make the dust particles
lose orbital energy and spiral toward the central star, with

the Sun in ∼3 Myr, a timescale much smaller than the age of the Sun; this means that the dust
observed in the solar system (and around other mature stars) cannot be primordial but must
be replenished by planetesimals.
Because P-R drag is of order v
c and v is highest at perihelion, the orbit not only shrinks but
also circularizes, with

The solid line is the numerical result and the dotted and dashed lines are two analytical results. At
ﬁrst, the particle drifts inward due to P-R and corpuscular drag; during that time, its semimajor
axis and eccentricity decrease. Then the particle is trapped for 14 Myr in the exterior 4:3 MMR with
Neptune; during this time, the eccentricity of the particle increases until is suﬃciently high to leave
the resonance, after which the particle keeps migrating inward (From Moro-Martín and Malhotra
2002)
2.1.5 Eﬀect of Radiation Forces on the Dust Spatial Distribution
In steady state, dust production, and dust loss are balanced, and the amount of mass that crosses
a given radius r per unit time is a constant, i.e., ˙M = πvrσ(r) = const., where v is the dust
particles velocity and σ(r) is the dust disk surface density. For unbound grains being blown out
by radiation pressure, v ∼const., σ(r) ∝
r and n(r) ∝

r(where the latter is the disk number
density). For bound grains drifting inward under P-R drag, v = vpr =

r , which results
in a dust disk with constant surface density, σ(r) ∝˙M = const., and a number density that is
inversely proportional to the distance to the central star, n(r) ∝

present in the system, on their journey toward the central star, the dust grains will be affected by
gravitational perturbations that will modify the spatial distribution of the dust. The following
describes the effect of the giant planets on the distribution of Kuiper belt dust in the solar system.
2.2.1 Resonant Perturbations
> Figure 9-18 shows the dynamical evolution of a typical dust particle from the Kuiper belt.
As the particle drifts inward due to P-R and solar wind drag, its semimajor and eccentric-
ity decrease (following ( > 9.9) and ( > 9.10)). Then the particle might get trapped in a
mean motion resonance (MMR) with one of the giant planets – most commonly with Nep-
tune because it is the outermost planet. Mean motion resonances are located where the orbital
period of the dust particle is p+q
p
times that of the planet, Tdust =
p+q
p Tpl, where p and q are
integers, p > , and p + q ⩾. While the planet orbital period is Tpl = π(

(because
the particle “feels” a less massive Sun by a factor of 1–β). Therefore, mean motion resonances

. To account for corpuscular drag forces, one
would substitute β by β(+ sw). A particle is trapped when in the reference frame corotating
with the planet, the closest approach between the particle and the planet is always at the same
point(s) along the particle orbit (one point if q = 1, two points if q = 2); at these location(s),
the particle receives repetitive “kicks” from the perturbing planet that are always in the same
direction and can balance the energy loss due to P-R drag, halting the particle migration. While
trapped, the particle semimajor axis stays constant, while its eccentricity slowly increases (as
it can be seen in >Fig. 9-18). The amount of time the particle stays trapped in the MMR is
highly variable. The particle escapes from the resonance when its eccentricity becomes suffi-
ciently high (∼0.3 for the KB dust particle shown in >Fig. 9-18). After escaping, the particle
keeps spiraling inward under P-R and solar wind drag (following again ( > 9.9) and ( > 9.10).
The histogram in >Fig. 9-19 shows the trapping of Kuiper belt dust particles in MMRs. Even
though the widths of the resonant regions are finite, these narrow regions of parameter space
can become densely populated with dust because they are constantly being fed by the inward
migration of dust particles under P-R and stellar wind drag. The features in the histogram are
more pronounced for the larger grains (small β) than for the smaller grains (large β) because
the larger grains have a higher trapping probability due to their slower migration velocity

Neptune, and the clearing of dust at Neptune’s location (indicated with a black dot). The disk
structure is more prominent for larger particles (smaller β values) because the P-R drift rate is
slower and the trapping is more eﬃcient. The disk is more extended in the case of small grains
(large β values) because small particles are more strongly aﬀected by radiation pressure. The his-
togram shows the relative occurrence of the diﬀerent MMRs for diﬀerent sized grains, where
the large majority of the peaks correspond to MMRs with Neptune. The inner depleted region
inside ∼10 AU is created by gravitational scattering of dust grains with Jupiter and Saturn (From
Moro-Martín and Malhotra 2002)

s , where s is the radius of the particle). Generally, more massive planets
exert a stronger perturbing force and allow the trapping of dust particles at resonances located
further away from the planet. However, as it can be seen in the histogram, Neptune dominates
the trapping of Kuiper belt dust because, even though is not the most massive planet, it is the
outermost planet and its exterior resonances are not affected by the interior MMRs (located
where the orbital period of the planet is p+q
p
times that of the particle – cf. Moro-Martín et al.
2008; Wyatt 2008a).
2.2.2 Gravitational Scattering
>Figure 9-18) shows that afterthe Kuiper belt dust particle leaves the resonance, it will continue
spiraling inward under the effects of P-R and corpuscular drag. This inward journey will take the
particle near the orbit of a giant planet, where neighboring MMRs overlap and make the orbit
of the particle chaotic and subject to gravitational ejection. This chaotic region extends from

(Wisdom 1980). Dynamical models show that most of the Kuiper belt dust
grains get ejected from the solar system by gravitational scattering with the giant planets: for
particles with β ≤0.4, the percentage ofparticles ejected byUranus and Neptune is 5–20%, while
for Saturn and Jupiter is 25–40% (where the efficiency of ejection refer to each planet); only 10–
20% of the Kuiper belt dust particles are able to pass these gravitational barriers and drift into
the inner solar system. >Figure 9-20 shows the dependency of the efficiency of gravitational
ejection on the planet mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity: planets with masses of 3–10 MJup
located between 1 and 30 AU in a circular orbit around a solar-type star eject >90% of the dust
grains that go past their orbits; a 1 MJup planet at 30 AU ejects >80% of the grains and about 60%
if located at 1 AU, while a 0.3 MJup planet ejects about 40% if located at 30 AU and <10% if it is
at 1 AU. The efficiency of ejection decreases significantly as the planets, eccentricity increases,
e.g., for a 1 MJup planet at 5 AU the efficiency of ejection decreases from 80% for e = 0 to 30% for
e = 0.5. For eccentric planets, the particle ejection preferentially takes place along the major axis
of the planet’s orbit, with the number of particles ejected in the apoastron direction exceeding
that in the periastron direction by a factor of 5 for e = 0.5 (because the planet spends more time
near apoastron and therefore the probability of encounter with a dust particle is higher near
that location).
2.2.3 Secular Perturbations
The gravitational forces on the dust particle exerted by planetary companions are described
by a sum of many terms, known as the perturbing function. Secular perturbations are the
long-term average of these forces; they result from the terms of the perturbing function that
are independent of the mean longitude of the planets and the dust particles. Unlike the reso-
nant perturbations described above, secular perturbations are nonperiodic in nature and act on
longer timescales (>0.1 Myr). They can be thought of as the perturbations that would arise if the
mass of the perturbing planet were to be spread out along its orbit (like a wire), weighting the
mass density to reflect how much time the planet spends in each region. A planet on an eccen-
tric orbit can force an eccentricity on the test particles; if the planet and the test particle are not

co-planar, the secular perturbations will tend to align their orbits; secular perturbations do not
affect the semimajor axis of the particles. If there is only one perturbing planet, the strength
of the perturbation is independent of its mass, but the smaller the mass, the longer the secular
timescale. If there is more than one perturbing planet, particles with precession rates that coin-
cide with the eigenfrequencies of the planetary system (resulting from secular perturbations
between the planets) will be strongly affected by secular perturbations (see, e.g., >Fig. 9-21),
resulting in the ejection of these particles from the secular resonant region (cf. Murray and
Dermott 1999; Wyatt et al. 1999; Wyatt 2008a).
2.2.4 Eﬀect of Gravitational Forces on the Dust Spatial Distribution
Resonant Perturbations
>Figure 9-19 shows that the trapping of Kuiper belt dust in MMRs results in the formation of
structure in the dust disk consisting on resonant rings outside the orbit of the perturbing planet,
asymmetric clumps and a clearing of dust at the planet position. The rings are created when the
dust particles are on nearly circular orbits and because they spend a significant part of their
lifetime trapped at certain semimajor axis, corresponding to the most favorable MMRs. For
Kuiper belt dust, with a low eccentricity perturbing planet and low eccentricity dust-producing
parent bodies, the most favorable MMRs are the first-order resonances 2:1, 3:2, 4:3…The clumps
appear when the particles are on eccentric orbits: when trapped in a resonance, the particle

Eﬀect of the secular perturbations created by the two planets in the HD 38529 system. The plane-
tary masses, semimajor axes, and eccentricities are the following: Mb(sini) = 0.8 MJup, ab = 0.13AU,
eb = 0.25, for planet b, and Mc(sini) = 12.2 MJup, ac = 3.74 AU, ec = 0.35, for planet c. The shaded
zones denote areas that are strongly unstable due to planet-crossing orbits and overlapping
ﬁrst-order mean motion resonances. The y-axis is the maximum eccentricity imposed on the test
particles (initially on circular orbits). The secular modes of the two planets excite the eccentrici-
ties of the test particles. The eﬀect of these perturbations can be felt at a wide range of distances
from the star: secular eccentricity excitation exceeds 0.1 to nearly 60 AU; the sharp peak at 55 AU
is due to a resonance with the slow mode. The dust observed in the system is likely produced
by planetesimals located in the regions of low eccentricity from ∼20 to 50 AU (From Moro-Martín
et al. 2007b)
orbits tend to be oriented always in the same direction with respect to the location of the planet,
and clumps are created nearapocenter, where the particles spend more time; because the clumps
are fixed with respect to the planet position, they should follow the orbit of the planet (rotating
in the reference frame of the star), and this can be used as an observational test to assess if the
proper motion of the clump is consistent with dust particles trapped in an MMR. The clearing
of dust near the planet position is created because when trapped in a resonance, the particle
avoids being close to the perturbing planet.
The resonant features described above for the Kuiper belt dust disk (>Fig. 9-19) have yet to
be observed because the foreground thermal emission from the dust in the innersolarsystem (of
asteroidal and cometary origin) overwhelms the background emission from the colder Kuiper
belt dust. However, resonant features have been observed in the zodiacal cloud itself: a ring of
asteroidal dust particles trapped in the 1:1 corotating resonance with the Earth at around 1 AU,
with a 10% number density enhancement on the Earth’s wake that results from the resonance
geometry (Dermott et al. (1994b)). Modeling and observations of the Kuiper belt dust and of
the zodiacal cloud indicate that planets with a wide range of masses (down to Neptune and
Earth masses) can create high-contrast features via resonant trapping.
> Figure 9-19 shows that the resulting dust disk structure depends on the particle size
under consideration. This is because the dynamical evolution of the particle depends on its
size: large particles interact weakly with the stellar radiation field, migrate slowly, and can get
easily trapped in MMRs; small grains, on the other hand, interact strongly with radiation, their

Dusty Planetary Systems 9

inward migration is faster, and this gives rise to more extended and more uniform disks (Liou
and Zook 1999; Moro-Martín and Malhotra 2002).
Mean motion resonances can alsobe populated ifthe perturbing planet migrates outward; in
this case, the resonant trapping probability depends on the planet migration rate and the extent
of the migration. In the solar system, the early migration of Neptune resulted in the trapping
of Kuiper belt objects in MMRs, primarily in the 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, and 2:1 (Malhotra 1993). This
means that the dust-producing planetesimals may have an asymmetric distribution (note that
the disk models in >Fig. 9-19 assumed a uniform distribution of the dust-producing bodies,
with angular elementsuniformly distributed between 0 and 2π). If the parent bodies themselves
are trapped in a resonance, the largest dust grains released from them would remain trapped in
the same MMR, the smallest grains (with β > .) would escape the system producing a spiral
structure, and the intermediate size grains (with β < .) would leave the resonance but remain
on bound orbits producing an axisymmetric distribution (Wyatt 2008a).
Gravitational Scattering
High-contrast features can also be produced by gravitational scattering: for planetary systems
in which the source of the dust is outside the orbit of a massive planet, gravitational ejection
can result in the formation of a dust-depleted region inside the planet orbit, where the depletion
factor depends on the planet’s mass and orbit (>Fig. 9-20). Models indicate that a dust-depleted
region of ∼10 AU in radius is expected to be present in the Kuiper belt dust disk due to gravi-
tational scattering by Jupiter and Saturn (> Figs. 9-19 and >9-22). There are also indications
that large inner cavities are very common in extrasolar debris disks (see >Fig. 9-11 and the
discussion in >Sect. 1.3.3).

30 to 50 AU, due to trapping in MMRs with Neptune (From Moro-Martín and Malhotra 2002)

Secular Perturbations
Secular perturbations can also produce warps, spirals, and brightness asymmetries. A warp is
created when the planet and the test particles are on noncoplanar orbits, and because the secular
perturbations will tend to align their orbits on a shorter timescale closer to the star. With time,
the inflection point of the warp (marking the boundary between perturbed and unperturbed
orbits) will move outward at a rate that depends on the planet mass and semimajor axis and is
proportional to Mpl a
pl (Mouillet et al. 1997), which in principle could be used to constrain the
planet mass if the age of the planet were known. With time, the warp will end up disappearing,
unless multiple planets on noncoplanar orbits are present in the system. Spirals are created if the
planet is in an eccentric orbit; in this case, the secular perturbations can force an eccentricity on
the test particles creating two spiral structures that with time propagate away from the planet.
This also creates a brightness asymmetry because, after all the test particles have been affected,
there is an offset in the dust disk center with respect to the star.
Some of the structure observed in the zodiacal cloud is the result of secular perturbations,
namely, the inner edge of the cloud around 2 AU (due to a secular resonance with Saturn that
also explains the inner edge of the main asteroid belt), the offset of the cloud center with respect
to the Sun, the inclination of the cloud with respect to the ecliptic, and the cloud warp (cf.
Murray and Dermott 1999; Wyatt et al. 1999; Wyatt 2008a). And as it was discussed in Part I,
these features can also be seen in extrasolar dust disks, e.g., the warps in AU Mic and β Pic, the
offsets with respect to the central star in є-Eri and Fomalhaut, the brightness asymmetries in
Fomalhaut and HD 32297, and the spiral structure in HD 141569, to name a few (see >Fig. 9-3
and discussion in >Sect. 1.3.3).
Debris Disk Structure Can Unveil the Presence of Planets
Most of the structural features discussed above depend on the mass and orbit of the planet,
and as the case of the solar system illustrates, the structure is sensitive to small planets (like the
Earth) and to planets located far from the star (like Neptune). As discussed in >Sect. 1.3.3,
this opens the possibility of using the study of the dust disk structure as a detection technique
of planets of a wide range of masses and semimajor axes. The discovery of the planets around
Fomalhaut and β-Pic, that were previously predicted to exist based on the structure of both
debris disks, illustrates this idea (see discussion in >Sect. 1.3.3 and >Fig. 9-3). Particularly
interesting is that this method is complementary to radial velocity and transit surveys (which
are limited to planets relatively close to the star) and to direct imaging (which is limited to young
and massive planets).
2.3 Collisions

The timescale for a collision between two equal-sized grains of radius s is tc =

π(s+s)F , where
F is the particle flux. The flux is given by F = N
V Δv, where N is the total number of particles in
the disk, V is the total volume they occupy, and Δv is their velocity dispersion. If the particles in
the dust disk have nonzero eccentricities and inclinations (e and i, with i in radians), they will
occupy a volume V = πa ⋅ae ⋅ia = πaei, where the factor πa is the disk circumference,
ae is its width (from pericenter, a(−e), to apocenter, a(+ e)), and ia is its thickness;

removes only a small fraction of KB dust grain as they drift into the inner solar system (this is
referred to as the P-R-dominated regime). Compared to interstellarcollisions, mutual collisions
in the present-day Kuiper belt are less significant because the relative velocity of Kuiper belt
dust grains (∼1.6 km s−) is significantly smaller than the impact velocity of interstellar grains
(∼25 km s−), making shattering less likely, and because the optical depth of the Kuiper belt is
very small so that collisions are infrequent. Due to limitations in the sensitivity of the detectors,
the majority of the extrasolar debris disks observed with Spitzer have optical depths ≳100 times
that of the Kuiper belt; unlike in the solar system, in these systems, collisional destruction plays
a significant role in the dust dynamics and resulting disk structure (this is referred to as the
collision-dominated regime; Wyatt 2005, 2008b). The improved sensitivity of observatories like
ALMA, JWST, and SPICA (and to some degree Herschel) will enable the study of debris disks
that are in the P-R-dominated regime (i.e., KB dust disk analogs).
2.3.2 Eﬀect of Collisions on the Dust Size Distribution
The size distribution most commonly adopted for both interstellar and debris dust is n(s)ds ∝
s−.ds (Dohnanyi 1969; Mathis et al. 1977). It results from a catastrophic quasi-steady state col-
lisional cascade in which the dust is derived from the grinding down of larger bodies, assuming
that (1) the strength of the particle does not depend on the target size (where the strength is
measured as the energy per unit volume needed to break and disperse the target) and (2) the
system is in quasi-steady state, i.e., the same amount of mass that enters one size bin as larger
particles break down leaves the size bin as the particles continue breaking in smaller pieces.
Obviously, the bins at the two extremes would not be in steady state, and the reservoir of large
particles would get depleted with time. For q = −., the mass is dominated by the large grains,
and the cross-section is dominated by the small grains. For comparison, in a size distribution

with a power-law index q = −3, each size bin will contain an equal amount of cross-sectional
area, while for q = −4, each size bin will contain an equal amount of mass.
However, the particle strength is in fact a function of the target size (unlike assumed above).
For small objects, this critical specific energy for disruption and dispersal, Q∗
D, is dominated by
the material strength, while for large objects, it is dominated by self-gravity, with a turnover of
around 100 m (even for relatively small particles, gravity can play an important role because
the transfer of momentum is inefficient and more energy than that required to shatter the tar-
gets is needed to dispersed the fragments). The turnover results in a sum of two power laws

The particle-in-the-box scenario described above that gives rise to the q = −3.5 power-
law index can be less restrictive by taking into account a size-dependent particle strength, the
removal of the smallest particles by radiation pressure, and the effect of collisions with grains

coming from the inner regions on highly eccentric orbits. Numerical models that take these
factors into account find that the size distribution changes from a strict single power law of
index −3.5 to a wavy distribution; the resulting size distribution depends on the distance from
the star, with the waves being more pronounced in the outer regions because the particles
there are more affected by collisions with high-velocity grains (just below the blowout size)
coming from the inner disk. The following results from numerical simulations by Thébault
and Augereau (2007) illustrate the effect of collisions. Integrated over the entire disk, these
models find an overdensity of particles with sizes ∼sblow, and a depletion of particles with
sizes in the range (10–50) sblow, where sblow is the blowout size (see > Fig. 9-24). For sizes

of the smallest grains affected by radiation pressure. >Figure 9-24 shows that when taking these
factors into account, the collisional lifetime depends strongly on the particle size (with a wavy
pattern) and in some cases (for particles <100 μm) can be two orders of magnitude smaller than

s is the particle size, s= .sblow, s= sblow, τ is the geometrical vertical optical depth, r is
the distance to the star, and Ω is the angular velocity at r (Thébault and Augereau 2007).
The size distribution of the collisional debris is expected to evolve with time becausethe col-
lisional timescale depends on the particle size. Small dust-size particles have shorter lifetimes,
and theyreach collisional equilibrium faster, i.e., theirsize distribution changes quicklyfrom the
primordial one to that of reprocessed material, while larger particles will retain their primordial
size distribution for a longer period, creating a “knee” in the size distribution. The critical size
at which the transition from a primordial to a collisional equilibrium population takes place
increases with time. The largest bodies may not achieve collisional equilibrium within the age
of the system. This will result in a combination of power laws for the size distribution, with
waves in the smaller end triggered by the dust loss processes.
The size distributions of the small body population in the solar system(asteroids and KBOs)
are partly the result of these processes. The top panel of >Fig. 9-25 (from Bottke et al. 2005)
shows the results of the collisional evolution models of the asteroid belt: as time goes by, the
initial size distribution changes from a power law (solid straight line in the left panel) to the
observed wavy distribution (thick dotted line); the observed distribution has two main fea-
tures, one at D ∼120 km, leftover from the planetesimal accretion process, and another one
at D ∼200 m, marking the transition between the regime where particles are held by strength
forces and the regime where particles are held by self-gravity. The bottom panel of >Fig. 9-25
(from Bernstein et al. 2004) shows the size distribution of the KBOs; even though this size dis-
tribution is more difficult to constrain due to the greater distance (in particular at the small
size end), observations show a strong break to a shallower size distribution at D < 100 km, the
boundary where the particles become more susceptible to collisional destruction. The size dis-
tributions of the asteroid and the Kuiper belts indicate that collisions have played an important
role in the evolution of the solar system.
2.3.3 Eﬀect of Collisions on the Dust Spatial Distribution
When the optical depth of the disk, τ, is large enough so that collisions dominate the dynamics,
i.e., when tc ∼

τ ( r
AU)
/
< tpr ∼
rc
GM∗β, the particles will not be able to migrate far from their
parent bodies under P-R drag. This is not the case in the solar system, but it is the case in many
extrasolar debris disks observed to date (Wyatt 2005). Under these conditions, small particles
will not be able to spiral in and sweep a wide range of semimajor axes that may allow them to
get trapped in MMRs or get ejected by gravitational scattering; on the contrary, these grains
will get quickly ground down into smaller particles that radiation pressure sets on eccentric or
hyperbolic orbits. On the other hand, large bodies with longer collisional lifetimes will closely
trace the spatial distribution of their parent bodies (which could show structure due to the effect
of gravitational perturbations).
Models in Thébault and Augereau (2007) show the effect of collisions on a planetesimal belt
with an initial radial distribution ∝r−., characteristic of the minimum mass solar nebula.
They found that the radial distribution of submillimeter size particles (which dominate the disk
optical depth) gets significantly flatter because of two reasons: the smallest grains just over the
blowout size are set on eccentric orbits and spend most of their time outside the orbit of their
parent planetesimals, and the erosion of the larger 0.05–1 mm grains (the source of the smallest
particles) proceeds faster in the inner regions.

that measures the degree of collisional evolution; the fact that t is greater than the age of the solar
system indicates that the asteroid belt was signiﬁcantly more massive in the past and that dynam-
ical clearing must have played an important role. (Bottom): cumulative surface density of the KBOs

2.3.4 Eﬀect of Collisions on the Dust Disk Evolution
The steady state scenario described in >Sect. 2.3.2 cannot be sustained for an indefinite period
of time because the reservoir of large particles that feeds the collisional cascade gets depleted,
resulting in a decay of the amount of dust in the system. In the simplest scenario, the dust is
derived from the grinding down of planetesimals, the planetesimals are destroyed after one
collision, and the number of collisions is proportional to the square of the number of planetes-
imals, N; in this case, dN
dt ∝N and N ∝
t . In a collisional cascade, the dust production rate,

480 9
Dusty Planetary Systems
Rprod, would be proportional to the loss rate of planetesimals times a proportionality constant,
Rprod ∝dN
dt ( sdust
sparent )−., where sdust and sparent are the sizes of the dust and the parent bodies,
respectively. In this scenario, sdust
sparent is independentof time and one gets Rprod ∝dN
dt ∝N ∝
t.
One can solve for the amount of dust in the disk in steady state by equating the dust produc-
tion rate to the dust loss rate, Rloss. Depending on the number density of dust, n, there are
two different solutions: (1) If the number density of dust particles is low, the disk is in the
P-R drag-dominated regime where the dust loss rate is determined by P-R drag (tc > tpr); in
this case, the dust loss rate is proportional to the number density of particles, Rloss ∝n, and
from Rprod = Rloss, one gets n ∝

t. (2) If the number density of dust is high, the disk is in
the collision-dominated regime, where the main dust removal process is grain–grain collisions
(tc < tpr); in this case, the dust loss rate is given by Rloss ∝n, and from Rprod = Rloss, one gets
n ∝
t , i.e., both the dust mass and the number of parent bodies (and therefore the total disk
mass) decay as 
t , with a characteristic timescale that is inversely proportional to the initial disk
mass (Dominik and Decin 2003).
The solar system is in the P-R drag-dominated regime, while, due to limited sensitivity of
the observations, the majority of the extrasolar debris disks known to date are in the collision-
dominated regime; this explains why the intensity of the dust emission of the entire sample of
debris disk systems (for similar-type stars, and including stars with a wide range of ages) roughly
follows a t−decay (see >Fig. 9-9). More specifically, the decay of the dust mass, the fractional
luminosity Ldust/Lstar, and the thermal excess is better approached by tξ with ξ = −0.3 to −0.4
(Löhne et al. 2008); it deviates from t−because this corresponds to the assumption that all the
bodies have achieved collisional equilibrium; however, the largest planetesimals of some of the
debris disks observed (with ages ranging from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr) would not have had enough
time to achieve collisional equilibrium within the age of the system. The index depends on the
particle strength as a function of particle size and the properties of the largest planetesimals
(primordial size distribution, eccentricities, and inclinations – the latter two determining their
rate of collisions).
2.4 Other Physical Processes
2.4.1 Dust Sublimation
Silicate dust grains sublimate at ∼1,500 K, while for icy grains 1–100 μm in size the destruction
temperature is ∼120 K (the timescale of sublimation increases dramatically above 100 K). The
following is an estimate of the corresponding sublimation distance. If the grain is larger than
the peak wavelengths of both the absorbed and emitted radiation, the grain is in the blackbody
regime where it emits and absorbs efficiently and its temperature is given by
Tdust = ( L∗
L⊙
)
/
( r
AU)
−/
K,
(9.15)
where r is the heliocentric distance; if the grain is larger than the peak wavelength of the
absorbed radiation but smaller than the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation, the grain
is in the intermediate size regime and
Tdust = ( L∗

)
/
( r

where sμm is the grain radius and ξ ∼2π,

π and 1 for strongly, weakly, and moderately absorb-
ing material, respectively (Backman and Paresce 1993). From Wien’s law, the peak wavelength
is given by λpeak = 
T
μm. The incident solar radiation (T⊙= 5,778 K) peaks at 0.6 μm, while
the emitted radiation would peak at 2.5 μm if Tdust = 1,500 K or 30 μm if Tdust = 120 K. In the
former case, silicate grains larger than ∼2.5 μm would be in the blackbody regime in which case
the sublimation temperature of 1,500 K would be achieved at a distance of r ∼0.03 AU. In the
latter case, icy grains smaller than 30 μm would be in the intermediate size regime achieving
the destruction temperature of 120 K at 4 AU (for 1 μm grains) and 2 AU (for 30 μm grains).
2.4.2 Lorentz Force
Dust grains are expected to be electrically charged due to the accretion of stellar wind ions and
electrons, ionization due to impacts with stellar wind particles, and the ejection of electrons
due to UV radiation (the latter process dominating the charging of solar system dust). Once
charged, the dust grains will be subject to the Lorentz force, FL = qvB, where q is the electric
charge, v is the velocity of the grain with respect to the field, and B is the magnetic field flux
density.
In the case of the solar system, the grains inside the heliosphere (<150 AU) are subject
to the interplanetary magnetic field. This field has a dipole component that changes polarity
every 11 years with the 22 year solar cycle; near the ecliptic, these sign reversals take place more
rapidly because of the presence of the heliospheric current sheet (the extension of the Sun’s
magnetic equator into interplanetary space, separating regions of opposite polarity). At solar
minimum, the current sheet extends from approximately −○to ○from the solar equator;
particles within this latitude range will cross the current sheet at least twice every solar rota-
tion (∼27 days) or four or even six times if the current sheet is wrapped because of higher order
terms in the magnetic field; particles at higher ecliptic latitudes will cross the current sheet at
least twice as they orbit the Sun. These sign reversals will cause a random walk in the semimajor
axis of the particles; for particles smaller than a few microns, this random walk will dominate
over the P-R drift on timescales from a few orbital periods in the inner solar system to a few tens
of orbital periods in the outer solar system. In addition to the dipole, the interplanetary mag-
netic field has a dominant component that is perpendicular to the radial solar wind vector, with
a magnitude ∼⋅−
r(AU) Gauss (for heliocentric distances r exceeding a few AU); the Lorentz force
in this case will tend to scatter the smallest dust particles out of the ecliptic plane by perturbing
the particle inclinations while keeping the energy of the orbit unchanged.
Because, as described above, the circumstellar magnetic field can have a complex struc-
ture and time behavior, it is difficult to include the effect of the Lorentz force in the study of
the dynamics and spatial distribution of dust particles in extrasolar debris disks for which the
magnetic field properties are unknown.
2.4.3 Sputtering
Dust grains erode with time due to the impact of energetic stellar wind particles (a process
known as sputtering). The study of exposed lunar rocks allows to estimate the rate of erosion,
resulting in values that differ by two orders of magnitude, where a rate of ∼0.2 Å year−at 1 AU
would be on the high-end; this rate scales with distance as r−. Dynamical models indicate that

482 9
Dusty Planetary Systems
a dust particle with Kuiper belt origin has a typical lifetime of ∼year, most of which is spent
at a > 20 AU. Assuming the particle spends 10year at 20 AU from the Sun, the fraction of mass
loss due to erosion (at the highest measured rate) would be ∼50% for a 3 μm particle, scaling
as s−, where s is the particle radius; if the erosion rate is 100 times smaller (which is within the
present uncertainties), the mass loss would be negligible. The erosion rate is uncertain because
sputtering can cause chemical alteration on the dust grain surface (via the implantation of stellar
wind ions) that can create molecular bondings between layers of dissimilar materials making
them erosion resistant. These chemical alterations may also change the optical properties of
the grain (e.g., by producing a blackened highly carbonized and refractory surface layer from
organic and volatile grain mantles), which can affect the particle’s response to radiation forces
and therefore its lifetime.
2.5 Open Questions
There are many open questions in debris disk modeling, some are related to the model input
parameters, while others are related to the modeling procedures. Regarding the input param-
eters, the lack of spectral features in most of debris disk spectra makes it difficult to constrain
the dust properties – like particle size distribution, composition, shape, and porosity – which
determine the particle emission properties and dynamics (because they affect how the particle
interacts with radiation forces). The properties of the parent planetesimal are also unknown,
with the particle strength playing a key role in the dust-producing process via collisions. The
origin of the debris dust itself is also uncertain: a component may originate from steady-state
erosion, as the models generally assume, but now it has became clear that stochastic colli-
sions are required to explain some of the debris disk observations; however, the origin and
ubiquity of stochastic collisions remain unknown; in addition, in some cases, the debris dust
could also be due to cometary activity rather than planetesimal collisions. Another obvious
caveat is that, in most systems, little is known about the presence of planets, in particular
long-period planets and planets with low masses (and even when planets are identified, their
masses are generally not well determined); this makes it difficult to constrain the dynamical
state of the swarm of dust-producing planetesimal and the effect of the planets on the dust disk
structure.
But even if the input parameters were known, there are open questions regarding the model-
ing procedures and the physics involved. Regarding the physics, collisions are the most difficult
to account for because they take place across 12 orders of magnitude and involve a wide range of
relative velocities and incoming angles, from head-on to grazing collisions, with their outcome
ranging from particle growth, to cratering, to complete disruption.
Regarding the modeling, while the N-body approach (like that in > Figs. 9-18 and >9-19)
follows the trajectory of individual particles and can take into account the effect of planetary
perturbations, radiation forces, gas drag, and the interstellarmedium, the CPU power is limited
and such models cannot treat a number of particles sufficiently large to cover a wide range of
particle sizes; therefore, the N-body approach cannot model the particle size distribution. On
the contrary, statistical methods (like those in > Figs. 9-15 and >9-24), where the particles are
replace with packages with given distributions, allow to study the outcome of collisions and the
size distributions, but, due to the averaging over angular orbital elements, they lose accuracy in
the dynamical modeling and cannot study in detail the spatial distribution of the dust.

Abstract:
This chapter reviews various methods of detecting planetary companions to stars
from an observational perspective, focusing on radial velocities, astrometry, direct imaging,
transits, and gravitational microlensing. For each method, this chapter first derives or sum-
marizes the basic observable phenomena that are used to infer the existence of planetary
companions as well as the physical properties of the planets and host stars that can be derived
from the measurement of these signals. This chapter then outlines the general experimental
requirements to robustly detect the signals using each method, by comparing their magnitude
to the typical sources of measurement uncertainty. This chapter goes on to compare the various
methods to each other by outlining the regions of planet and host star parameter space where
each method is most sensitive, stressing the complementarity of the ensemble of the methods
at our disposal. Finally, there is a brief review of the history of the young exoplanet field, from
the first detections to current state-of-the-art surveys for rocky worlds.

Basic Principles of Planet Detection
This chapter begins by reviewing the basic phenomena that are used to detect planetary com-
panions to stars using various methods, namely, radial velocities, astrometry, transits, timing,
and gravitational microlensing. It derives the generic observables for each method from the
physical parameters of the planet/star system. These then determine the physical parameters
that can be inferred from the planet/star system for the general case.
Notation with subscripts ∗and p refers to quantities for the star and planet, respectively.
Therefore, a star has mass M∗, radius R∗, mean density ρ∗, surface gravity g∗, and effective
temperature T∗and is orbited by a planet of mass Mp, radius Rp, density ρp, temperature Tp,
and surface gravity gp. The orbit has a semimajor axis a, period P, and eccentricity e.
1.1 Spectroscopic Binaries and Orbital Elements
Exoplanet detection is essentially the extreme limit of binary star characterization, and so it
is unsurprising that the terminology and formalism of planetary orbits derives from that of
binaries.
Conservation of momentum requires that as a planet orbits a distant star, the star executes a
smaller, opposite orbit about their common center of mass. The size (and velocity) of this orbit
is smaller than that of the planet by a factor of the ratio of their masses. The component of this
motion along the line of sight to the Earth can, in principle, be detected as a variable radial
velocity. The mass of the exoplanet can be calculated from the magnitude of the radial velocity
(RV) or astrometric variations and from the mass of the star, determined from stellar models
and spectroscopy or astrometry.
Two mutually orbiting bodies revolve in ellipses about a common center of mass, the origin
of our coordinate system. Orbital angles in the plane of the bodies’ mutual orbit are measured
with respect to the line of nodes, formed by the intersection of the orbital plane with the plane
of the sky (i.e., the plane perpendicular to a line connecting the observer to the system’s cen-
ter of mass). The position of this line on the sky has angle Ω, representing the position angle
(measured east of north) of the ascending (receding) node, where the star (and planet) cross the
plane of the sky moving away from Earth. >Figure 10-1 illustrates the other orbital elements in

The argument of periastron ω is measured from the ascending (receding) node, and the true
anomaly ν is measured with respect to the periastron. Both angles increase along the direction of
thestar’smotion in theplaneof theorbit. Thelongitudeof theperiastron of thestar ω∗isindicated.
At a given time in the orbit, true anomalies of planet and star are equal, whereas the longitude of
periastron of the planet is related to that of the star by ωp = ω∗+ π. In Doppler planet detection,
the orbital elements of the star are conventionally reported, from which the orbital elements of the
planet can be inferred
the problem. As indicated, the orientation of the each orbital ellipse with respect to the plane of
the sky is specified by the longitude of periastron, ω, which is the angle between the periastron1
and the ascending node along the orbit in the direction of the motion of the body. Since the
orbit of the star is a reflection about the origin of the orbit of the exoplanet, the orbital param-
eters of the planet are identical to that of the star except that the longitudes of periastron differ
by π: ωp = ω∗+ π.
The physical size of the ellipse, given by the semimajor axis, a, is set by Newton’s modifica-
tion of Kepler’s third law of planetary motion:

The position of either body in its orbit about the origin can be expressed in polar coordi-
nates (r, ν), where ν is the true anomaly, the angle between the location of the object and the
periastron. The separation between the star and planet is given by
r(+ e cos ν) = a(−e),
(10.3)
where e is called the eccentricity of the orbit and has the domain [, ) for bound orbits.
The observed eccentricities of exoplanets are quite varied: eccentricities above 0.9 have been
seen in a few cases and eccentricities above 0.3 are common, at least for Jovian exoplanets
(Wright et al. 2011). >Figure 10-2 illustrates the physical shape of such orbits.
Practical computation of a body’s position in its orbit with time is usually performed
through the intermediate variable E, called the eccentric anomaly. E is related to the time since
periastron passage Tthrough the mean anomaly, M:
M = π(t −T)

1.2 Radial Velocities
The radial reflex motion of a star in response to an orbiting planet can be measured through
precise Doppler measurement, and this motion reveals the period, distance, and shape of the
orbit and provides information about the orbiting planet’s mass. (The treatment of RV and
astrometric measurement below follows Wright and Howard (2009)).
Six parameters determine the functional form of the periodic radial velocity variations and
thus the observables in a spectroscopic orbit of the star: P, K, e, ω∗, T, and γ (it is convention
in the Doppler-detection literature to refer to ω without its ∗subscript, but it is standard to
report the star’s argument of periastron, not the planet’s).
Vr = K[cos(ν + ω∗) + e cos ω∗] + γ
(10.7)
with ν related to P, e, and Tthrough E. The semiamplitude of the signal in units of velocity is
K (the peak-to-trough RV variation is K). The bulk velocity of the center of mass of the system
is given by γ.
For circular orbits e = , there is no periastron approach, and so Tand ω∗are formally
undefined; in such cases, a nominal value of ω∗(such as 0 or π/) sets T(alternatively, one can
specify the value of one of the angles at a given epoch).
In short, the variables P, T, and K, respectively, set the period, phase, and amplitude
of an RV curve, while the variables ω∗and e determine the shape of the radial veloc-
ity signature of an orbiting companion, as shown in
> Fig. 10-3. Characterization of the
orbits of single unseen companions, such as exoplanets, is ultimately an exercise in fitting
observed radial velocities to the family of curves in > Fig. 10-3 to determine the six orbital
parameters.
Two additional orbital parameters complete the description of a planet’s orbit: the inclina-
tion of the orbit, i, which determines the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the
sky, such that i = corresponds to a face-on, counterclockwise orbit and Ω, the longitude of
the ascending node. These parameters cannot be determined with radial velocity observations
alone and can only be measured through astrometry, where the angular displacement of the star
on the sky is directly measured.
The effect of the inclination of the orbit is to reduce the radial component of the velocity
of the star by sin i. The fundamental observable of a spectroscopic binary which constrains the
physical properties of system is thus

(10.8)
where G is Newton’s gravitational constant. The right-hand side of this equation is known
as the mass function of the system. For exoplanets where M∗can be estimated from stel-
lar models, the minimum value for Mp (i.e., its value for sin i = or an edge-on orbit)
is called the “minimum mass” of the planet and is usually labeled “Mp sin i” for succinct-
ness (since when Mp ≪M∗, its small correction to the denominator is negligible, though
not ignored). The true mass of the detected exoplanet is thus higher by a factor of / sin i,
which has a typical (median) value of 1.15 for randomly oriented orbits (all other things being
equal).

1.3 Astrometry
Plane-of-sky variations in a star’s position provide both redundant and complementary infor-
mation to radial velocities, yielding the true inclination and orientation of a planetary orbit.
Astrometry of the orbits of well-separated binary stars of similar magnitude is a matter of care-
ful instrument calibration to precisely measure the separation and position angle between the
stars. For exoplanet detection, the problem is to detect the motions around a star about an
unseen companion with respect to a set of (presumably) stable background stars.
For an orbit with semimajor axis a∗of a star at distance d from the Earth, producing an
astrometric signal of semiamplitude θ∗= a∗/d, astrometric orbits can be described in terms of
the Thiele-Innes constants
A = θ∗(cos Ω cos ω∗−sin Ω sin ω∗cos i)
(10.9)
B = θ∗(sin Ω cos ω∗+ cos Ω sin ω∗cos i)

The quantities ω∗and Ω have a ±π ambiguitythat is resolved with radial velocitymeasurements,

The C and H constants are related to the radial component of the motion. These constants
can be combined with the elliptical rectangular coordinates, defined as

(10.24)
and the magnitude of the astrometric offset from the apparent center of mass is (for small off-
sets) Δθ∗≡[Δδ+ (Δα cos δ)]/. In practice, astrometric motions are small perturbations
on the much larger parallactic and proper motions.
1.4 Imaging
The direct detection of planets is the most conceptually straightforward method of detection:
essentially, one seeks simply to directly detect photons from the exoplanet, resolved from those
of the parent star. Although the emission of exoplanets is indeed quite faint, it is generally the
problem of detecting this emission in the proximity of the much brighter stellar source that
presents the most severe practical obstacle to direct detection. The disentangling of stellar and

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
497
planetary photons is an imperfect process that is easiest at wider separations. The efficiency of
this disentangling ultimately determines the detection thresholds of an instrument. Therefore,
the most important parameters of the exoplanet for determining the difficulty of direct detec-
tion are the planet/star flux ratio fp and the angular separation between the planet and star.
Typically, contrast limits worsen at smaller angular separations.
The angular separation of the planet and star on the sky is given by
Δθ = r⊥/d,
(10.25)
where r⊥is the projected separation of the planet from the star and d is the distance to the
system. Bydefinition, if d is in parsecs and r⊥in AU, then θ is in arcseconds. In general, Δθ = (+
M∗/Mp)Δθ∗= (+ M∗/Mp)
√
(BX + GY)+ (AX + FY). For circular orbits, this reduces
to r⊥= a(cosβ + sinβ cosi)/, where β = ν + ωp is the angle between the position of the
planet along its orbit relative tothe ascending node. Planets typicallyorbit stars at distances from
hundredths to hundreds of AU. For a hypothetical giant planet orbiting 5 AU from a nearby star
sitting at 50 pc, this corresponds to a maximal angular separation of 100 mas.
The emission from an exoplanet can generally be separated into two sources: stellar emis-
sion reflected by the planet surface and/or atmosphere and thermal emission from the planet.
Thermal emission can be due to either “intrinsic” thermal emission (e.g., the fossil heat of for-
mation) or thermal emission from reprocessed stellar luminosity. Exoplanets may also produce
some nonthermal emission, which we will not consider here.
The reflected light will have a spectrum that is broadly similar to that of the star, with
additional features arising from the planetary surface and/or atmosphere. Therefore, for solar-
type stars, this reflected emission generally peaks at optical wavelengths. The monochromatic
planet/star flux ratio for reflected light can generally be written (e.g., Seager 2010)
fref,λ = Ag,λ ( Rp
a )

Φref,λ(α),
(10.26)
where Ag,λ is the monochromatic geometric albedo and Φref,λ is the reflected light phase curve,
which depends on the planetary phase angle α (the star-planet-observer angle) and the wave-
length λ. The geometric albedo is defined as the ratio of the flux emitted from the planet at α = 
relative to that of a perfectly and isotropically scattering uniform disk of equal solid angle. For a
circular orbit, cos α = sin β sin i.
Assuming that the thermal emission from the planet has a roughly blackbody spectrum, the
flux ratio is
ftherm,λ = ( Rp
R∗
)
Bλ(Tp)
Bλ(T∗)Φtherm,λ(α) →( Rp
R∗
)
Tp
T∗
Φtherm,λ(α),
(10.27)
where Φtherm,λ is the monochromatic thermal phase curve. For observations in the Raleigh-
Jeans tail of the blackbody, λ ≫hc/(kbT), and thus Bλ(T) ∝T, yielding the limit shown in
( > 10.27). If the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation, then Tp = Teq and
Teq
T∗
= ( R∗

/
[f (−AB)]/,
(10.28)
where AB is the Bond albedo, the fraction of the total energy incident on the planet that is
not absorbed, and f accounts the fraction of the entire planet surface over which the absorbed
energy is reemitted, i.e., f = /if the thermal energy is emitted over the entire π of the planet.

498 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
Of course, planets may be self-luminous as well, particularly if they are young and have retained
significant residual heat from formation.
The form for Φref,λ depends on the scattering properties of the planetary atmosphere. For
the case of a Lambert sphere that scatters all incident radiation equally in all directions,
ΦLambert,λ = 
π[sin α + (π −α) cos α].
(10.29)
Also for a Lambert sphere, AB = and Ag = /. The form for Φtherm,λ depends on the surface
brightness distribution of the planet, which in turn depends on the amount of heat redistribu-
tion. For the case of a tidally locked planet in which the absorbed radiation is promptly and
locally reemitted, the phase curve has the same form as for a Lambert sphere (Seager 2010).
Resolved emission of an planet/star system is essentially equivalent to a visual binary. Once
the overall scale of the system has been set, measurements of the position of the planet relative to
the star at a sufficient number of epochs yield all of the orbital elements of the system, up to the
twofold degeneracy in orientation with respect to the sky discussed previously. The scale of the
system can be set either by an estimate of the distance to the system or by an external estimate
of the primary mass M∗(under the assumption Mp ≪M∗). For reflected light measurements,
only the product of the geometric albedo and planet cross section can be determined; estimating
the planet radius independentlygenerally requires an assumption about the albedo. For thermal
light measurements, the temperature Tp can (in principle) be estimated from the flux at multiple
wavelengths, and then, the surface brightness can be estimated from Tp, and thus the radius can
be inferred from the planetary flux. The planet mass cannot be determined from the planet flux
or its relative orbit and must be inferred indirectly through coupled atmosphere/evolutionary
models.In some favorable cases, mutual gravitational perturbations in multiplanet systems may
allow the determination of the planet masses directly.
Of course, the real power of direct imaging lies in the ability to acquire spectra of the planets
once they are discovered and thus characterize the constituents of the planetary atmosphere.
This provides one of the only feasible routes to assessing the habitability of terrestrial planets in
the Habitable Zones (Kasting et al. 1993) of the parent stars and likely the only feasible route to
do so for Earthlike planets orbiting solar-type stars.
1.5 Transits
The presence of a planetary companion to a star gives rise to a multitude of physical phenomena
that manifest themselves via temporal variations of the flux of the system relative to that of an
otherwise identical isolated star. Typically, the largest of these occurs if a fortunate alignment
allows a planet to transit (pass in front of) its host star from our perspective. In this case, the
star will exhibit brief, periodic dimmings which signal the presence of the planet. Transits offer
a intriguingly simple way to detect planets.
The condition for a transit is roughly that the projected separation between the planet and
host star at the time of inferior conjunction of the planet is less than the sum of the radii of
planet and star, i.e., r(tc) cos i ≤R∗+ Rp, where r(tc) is the separation of the planet from
the host star at conjunction, and R∗and Rp are the radii of the star and planet, respectively.
Given the definition of ω∗, r(tc) = a(−e)/(+ e sin ω∗), and so transits occur when the

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10

impact parameter of the planet’s orbit with respect to the star in units of the host radius,
b ≡a cos i
R
−e
+ e sin ω∗
,
(10.30)
is less than the sum of the (normalized) radii, b ≤+ k, where k ≡Rp/R∗. Integrating over i
assuming isotropic orbits and thus a uniform distribution of cos i yields the transit probability
Ptr ≡(R∗+ Rp
a
) + e sin ω∗
−e
.
(10.31)
For a circular orbit and assuming k ≪, this reduces to the simple expression Ptr = R∗/a. Note
that in these expressions, we have used the longitude of the periastron of the orbit of star rather
than the (perhaps more intuitive) value for the planet, because the former is generally adopted
for fits to the stellar reflex radial velocity data.
When the planet transits in front of its parent star, the flux of the star will decrease by an
amount that is proportional to the ratio of the areas of the planet and star. For the purposes of
exposition, in the following, we assume a circular orbit, uniform host surface brightness, and
Rp ≪R∗≪a and Mp ≪M∗. In the general case of a limb-darkened star, eccentric orbit, and
arbitrary scales for Rp, R∗, and a, the expressions for the shape of the transit are considerably
more complicated, as are the arguments for the kinds of information that can be extracted from
transit and RV signals (see Winn 2010 and references therein). However, the basic structure
of the problem is the same under our approximations, and what follows serves to illustrate the
essential concepts.
Under these assumptions, the planet follows a rectilinear trajectory across the face of the star
with an impact parameter b, and the transit signature will have an approximately trapezoidal
shape, which can be characterized by the duration T, ingress/egress time τ, and fractional flux
depth δ. The depth of the transit relative to the out-of-transit flux is
δ = k.
(10.32)
The duration of the transit can be quantified by its full width at half maximum, which is roughly
the time interval T between the two points where the center of the planet appears to touch the
edges of the star. This is approximately
T ≃Teq(−b)/,
(10.33)
where it is useful to define the equatorial crossing time (i.e., the transit duration for b = ),
Teq ≡R∗P
πa = ftrP ≃(
P
πGρ∗
)
/
.
(10.34)
Here, ρ∗is the mean density of the host star and ftr ≡P/πa = Ptr/π is the transit duty cycle, or
the fraction of planet orbit in transit. The last equality, which assumes Mp ≪M∗, also implies
that, to an order of magnitude, the equatorial transit duration is the cube root of the product of
the orbital period and the stellar dynamical or free-fall time (tdyn ∼(Gρ∗)−/) squared.
The ingress/egress time (these are equal for a circular orbit) τ is the time between when the
edge of the planet just appears to touch the star for the first and second time (ingress or the time
between first and second “contact”) or third and fourth time (egress, the time between third and
fourth “contact”) and is given by
τ ∼Teqδ/(−b)−/.
(10.35)

Exoplanet Detection Methods
One of the most useful aspects of transiting planets is that, when combined with radial
velocity data, they allow one to infer the masses and radii of the star and planet up to a one-
parameter degeneracy, as follows. Measuring T, t, and δ from a single transit allows one to infer
b, Teq, and k:
b= −δ/T
τ ,
T
eq = Tτ
δ/,
k = δ/.
(10.36)
The impact parameter is related to the orbital inclination i via b = a cos i/R∗, but a and R∗can-
not be determined from light curves alone. With the detection of multiple transits, one can fur-
ther infer the period P and thus the stellar density ρ∗via ( >10.34). As reviewed in >Sect. 1.2,
the reflex radial velocity orbit of the star allows one to infer K and P which can be combined
to determine the mass function, ∼(M∗sin i)/M/
∗, but a determination of the planet mass
requires both a measurement of i and M∗. Thus, one additional parameter is needed to break
the degeneracy and set the overall scale of the system. This can be accomplished by impos-
ing external constraints on the properties of the primary, either through parameters measured
from high-resolution spectroscopy or parallax, or invoking theoretical relations between the
mass and radius of the star through isochrones or both. For illustration, if we assume the pri-
mary mass is precisely known, then we can infer R∗through ρ∗, and a through P, and thus
determine i from the impact parameter measurement. Finally, we can measure Rp from k and
the planet mass from the mass function, i, and M∗.
1.6 Gravitational Microlensing
The gravitational microlensing method detects planets via the direct gravitational perturbation
of a background source of light by a foreground planet (see Gaudi 2010, 2012 for thorough
reviews). When a foreground compact object (either a star or stellar remnant) happens to pass
very close to our line of sight to a more distant star, the light from the background star will
be split into two images. These images are typically unresolved, but they are magnified by an
amount that depends on the angular separation between the lens and source. Since this separa-
tion is a function of time, the background source exhibits a smooth, symmetric time-variable
magnification: a microlensing event. If the foreground planet happens to have a planetary com-
panion and the planetary companion happens to have a projected separation from the primary
lens near the paths of the two primary images, the gravity of the planet will further perturb the
light, resulting in a short-lived perturbation from the primary microlensing event, revealing the
planetary companion. Free-floating planets and planets widely separated from their parent star
can also be detected as isolated, short timescale microlensing events.
Consider a planet/star system acting as a lens located at a distance d and source located at a
distance ds. Light from the source is deflected, split into multiple images, and magnified by the
gravity of the foreground lens. The fundamental equation that is used to derive the observable
properties of a gravitational microlensing event is the lens equation, which relates the angular
separation β between the lens and source in the absence of lensing to the angular positions θ
of the images of the source created due to lensing. For a general lens system, these are vector
quantities, but for a single lens, the lens, source, and image positions are all colinear, so we can
drop the vector notation. The lens equation for an isolated point lens is (Einstein 1936)

The Einstein ring radius is the fundamental scale of gravitational microlensing and depends on
the distances to the lens and source, and the mass of the lens. At the distance of the lens, the

(

and thus, in general, an isolated point lens create two images. One of these images is always
separated by more than θE from the lens (y+ ≥) and the other is always separated by less
than θE(∣y−∣≤). The separation between the two images is ∼θE, and thus they are typically
unresolved. Becausethe images are distortedrelative to the source, they are also (de-)magnified.

The magnification increases for decreasing u (better source-lens alignment) and formally
diverges as u →for a point source.
The source, lens, and observer are all in relative motion, and thus the angular separation
between the source and lens is a function of time: a microlensing event. If we approximate the
relative proper motion μrel of the lens and source as constant, then we can parameterize the

Planetary companions to the lens star can be detected in a microlensing event if they happen
to have a projected separation in the paths of one or both of the images created by the primary
lens. As the image sweeps by the planet, the gravity of the planet will further perturb the light
from the source associated with the image, creating a short-lived deviation from the single-lens
form (Mao and Paczynski 1991; Gould and Loeb 1992).
Unfortunately, there are no simple analytic expressions relating the observable features
of planetary perturbations to the underlying physical parameters of the planet and host star.
Adding another body to the lens system increases the complexity of the lensing behavior sig-
nificantly and in particular inverting the lens equation for a binary lens to obtain the image
positions for a given source position cannot be done analytically. Furthermore, the binary grav-
itational lens has a rich and complex phenomenology, which we will not attempt to explore in
this brief review. We refer the reader to more comprehensive summaries by Bennett (2008) and
Gaudi (2012). Here, we will simply provide a qualitative discussion of planet detection with
microlensing.

Three additional parameters are required to uniquely specify the light curve due to a binary
lens (of which star/planet lenses are a subset). The planet/star mass ratio q = Mp/M∗and
instantaneous projected separation s = r⊥/rE between the planet and star in units of rE at the
time of the event together specify the magnification structure of the lens, i.e., the magnifica-
tion as a function of the (vector) source position u ≡β/θE. Finally, the parameter α (not to
be confused with the phase angle) describes the orientation of the source trajectory relative
to the projected planet/star axis. Thus a total of six parameters (tE, t, u, q, s, α) describe the
magnification as a function of time for a binary lens and are thus generically observable.
Single-lens microlensing events yield onlyone parameterthat depends on the physical prop-
erties of the lens star, namely, the time scale tE. The time scale provides only a weak constraint on
the lens mass, because it depends not only on the mass but also on the lens and source distances,
and the relative lens-source proper motion, all of which are relatively broadly distributed for a
typical microlensing survey. In addition, the lens stars are typically quite faint and are blended
with other stars (including the lensed source). Thus, little is generally known about the host
star properties. Planetary microlensing events generally yield two parameters that are related to
the planet properties, q and s. While q is of interest in its own right, s is generally not, because
it depends on the phase, orientation, and eccentricity of the orbit, as well as on the Einstein
ring radius, all of which are a priori unknown. Therefore, s is only weakly correlated with the
semimajor axis of the orbit and provides essentially no constraint on the other orbital elements.
Although this “baseline” situation sounds quite dire, in fact, it has been shown that with
additional effort, it is possible to obtain substantially more information about the host star,
planet, and its orbit for the majority of detected systems using a combination of subtle,
higher-order effects that are detectable in precise microlensing light curves, and follow-up
high-resolution imaging in order to isolate the light from the lens (Bennett et al. 2007).
1.7 Timing
A star or stellar remnant that exhibits regular, periodic photometric variability, such as pulsars,
pulsating white dwarfs, eclipsing binary stars, pulsating hot subdwarfs, or even stars with tran-
siting planets, can show evidence of a planetary companion through timing variations in those
periodic phenomena. There are three principal sources of such variations: the Doppler shift,
light-travel time, and gravitational perturbations.
The first of these sources is exactly analogous to the radial velocity method but measures
changes in frequencies of some property other than photons. If the period of the pulsations or
eclipses can be measured to sufficient precision, then the interpretation of those variations is
identical to that in the radial velocity method.
The light-travel time effect comes about when the reflex orbit of a star about the center of
mass of the star-planet system is sufficiently large that the additional light-travel time across
this orbit is detectable as a timing variation. This is not a truly distinct phenomenon from the
Doppler shift timing method, since it is essentially the accumulated effects of the Doppler-
shifted period that produce the timing anomaly. Depending on the period of the intrinsic
variation and the physical size of the star’s reflex orbit, either effect, or both, may be detectable.
The above methods have been most successfully employed with pulsars (through the pulse
arrival times) and eclipsing binary systems (through the timing of eclipse ingress and egress)
and were responsible for the detection of the first exoplanets (Wolszczan and Frail 1992).

504 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
Finally, in the case of an eclipsing system, such as an eclipsing binary or a transiting planet,
additional bodies in the system will perturb the orbits of the eclipsing bodies. These perturba-
tions can be especially large if the perturbing body is near a mean-motion resonance with the
other bodies. When applied to systems of transiting planets, this method is called transit timing
variations (TTVs, Agol et al. 2005; Steffen and Agol 2005; Holman and Murray 2005) and has
been most successfully employed by Kepler (e.g., Ford et al. 2012).
2
The Magnitude of the Problem
By almost any physical measure, planets are small in comparison to their parent stars, and the
observable phenomena that are used to directly or indirectly detect them are likewise small.
In this section, we attempt (where possible) to provide order-of-magnitude estimates of the
precisions ofthe relevant observations that are required todetect planets using various methods.
We then use these estimates, along with additional requirements imposed by the specifics of
the detection method (i.e., the detection efficiencies) to provide a broad outline of the practical
requirements that must be met for planet surveys to successfully detect planets with a given set
of properties.
In general, specifying the criteria needed to detect a planet requires a detailed analysis of
the signal and data properties as well as a quantitative definition of the meaning of a detection.
However, for many of the detection methods, a rough estimate can be obtained by decompos-
ing the primary observable signal into two conceptually different contributions: an overall scale
and detailed signal waveform. The overall scale, which depends on the physical parameters of
the system, encodes the order of magnitude of the signal and largely dictates its detectability.
The waveform itself depends on more subtle details of the system (i.e., the precise shape of the
planet orbit), but typically takes on values of order unity and thus has a relatively small effect
on the detectability of the signal. Therefore, in most cases, these two contributions can be fairly
cleanly separated. In this approximation, the detectability of a planet with a given set of proper-
ties therefore primarily depends primarily on the overall signal scale, and the data quality and
quantity, i.e., the typical observational uncertainties and the total number of observations. With
this in mind, given a signal amplitude A, number of observations N, and typical measurement
uncertainty σ, the detectability will depend primarily on the total signal-to-noise ratio S/N,
which scales as
S/N ≃g
√
N A
σ ,
(10.44)
where g is a factor of order unity that depends on the details of the signal.
2.1 Radial Velocities
The differential radial velocity signal of a planet has the form ΔVr = KF(t; e, ω∗, T, P), where
F(t) encodes the detailed shape of the RV signal. Assuming uniform and dense sampling of the
RV curve over a time span that is long compared to P and assuming a total of N observations
each with measurement uncertainty σRV, the total signal-to-noise ratio is
(S/N)RV ≃g(e, ω∗)
√
N K
σRV
.
(10.45)

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
505
For a circular orbit, g = −/and is generally a weak function of e for e ≲.. For larger eccen-
tricities, g declines gradually, but more importantly, the stochastic effects of finite sampling
become significant for typical values of N (e.g., O’Toole et al. 2009; Cumming 2004). For planets
with periods larger than the duration of the observations, the detectability depends addition-
ally on the period and phase of the planet, and generally decreases dramatically with increasing
period, typically as (S/N)RV ∝P−(e.g., Eisner and Kulkarni 2001; Cumming 2004).
Thus, a robust detection of a planet via RV typically requires achieving radial velocity
precisions of σRV ≪KN /. For Mp ≪M∗, the semiamplitude K is
K = ( P

(10.46)
Thus, to detect a true Jupiter analogue (i.e., a Jupiter-mass planet in a 11.8 year, circular orbit
around a solar-mass star), for which K ≃(.m/s) sin i, requires a few dozen observations
with precisions of a few m/s. An RV precision of m/s corresponds to a Doppler shift of K/c ≃
−. The motion induced by an Earth analogue is smaller by a factor of /(.)

∼so
requires an additional two orders of magnitude in precision.
Typically, the centroid of stellar spectral lines at fixed equivalent width can be measured with
a precision of ∝σ /
V /N /
eff , where σV is the effective velocity width of the spectral line and Neff
is the effective number of photons in the line (i.e., the equivalent width of the line times the pho-
ton rate per unit wavelength). Maximizing the precision requires that the lines are well resolved,
and thus that the instrumental velocity resolution is less than the intrinsic velocity width of the
star. For reference, the typical width of a spectral feature in a slowly rotating star is of order a
few kilometers per second (∼−), and thus resolving powers of (R = Δλ/λ ∼) are needed,
comparable to the resolving power of a typical high-resolution astronomical echelle spectro-
graph. The velocity precision per line is generally insufficient to detect planetary companions,
and thus averaging overmanylines is required. The statistical signal-to-noise ratio requirements
are quite stringent, and thus bright stars and/or large apertures are generally needed.
Because the velocity precisions needed to detect planetary companions are well below the
intrinsic widths of the spectral lines and even below the velocity precisions that can be obtained
for individual lines, getting close to the photon limit requires excellent control of systematics.
One of the most severe requirements is that the wavelength calibration must be both more
precise than the desired velocity precisions and stable over many times the orbital period of the
planet. For a Jupiter analogue, this wavelength calibration must be at a level of better than −
of a resolution element and stable over the course of decades. Since the Earth’s motion about the
Sun imparts a periodic Doppler shift of order 30 km/s (v/c = −), this accuracy and precision
must be maintained even as the spectral lines move annually by times the measurement
precision.
There are at least two proven2 paths to surmounting this challenge: though precise
instrumental calibration with an absorption cell (the iodine technique) and through instru-
mental ultra-stability (as exemplified by HARPS), both of which are briefly described in
> Sects. 4.3.1–4.3.5.
2Another technique, externally dispersed interferometry (EDI, Erskine and Ge 2000), has shown promise as a
third path to precise velocimetry. It employs an interferometer in front of a spectrograph at modest resolution,
generating a known, unresolved, sinusoidal transmission function, somewhat analogous to a gas cell’s absorp-
tion properties. The phase of the beating of the stellar spectrum against this pattern is a measure of radial
velocity.

2.2 Astrometry
The magnitude of the differential astrometric offset of a star at a distance d due to a planetary
companion has the general form Δθ∗= θ∗F(t; e, ω∗, i, T, P), where the semi-amplitude of the
astrometric offset for a circular, face-on orbit is
θ∗≡a
d
Mp
M∗
,
(10.47)
and we have assumed Mp ≪M∗. Again, assuming uniform and dense sampling of the astro-
metric curve over a time span that is long compared to P and assuming a total of N observations
each with measurement uncertainty σAST, the total signal-to-noise ratio is
(S/N)AST ≃g(e, ω∗, i)
√
N θ∗
σAST
.
(10.48)
We note for simplicity we have assumed that each observation yields a given uncertainty σAST
on the magnitude of the vector position of the star relative to some reference frame; in reality,
each of these measurements may require a separate measurement for each of the two orthogonal
directions. For e = , g(i) = [.(+ cosi)]/. For more general cases, the behavior of g is
qualitatively similar to that for radial velocity signals. For e ≠, g depends additionally on ω∗
and e but is a relatively weak function of e for e ≲.. However, the effects of finite sampling
start tobecome more important as e increases, particularlyforlow N. When P is greaterthan the
span of observations, the detectability also depends on Tand P, generally decreasing rapidly
with increasing period, also typically as P−.
The magnitude of the astrometric signal of a Jupiter analogue orbiting a nearby solar-type
star at a distance of D ∼pc is θ∗≃.mas, whereas for an Earth analogue, the astrometric
wobble is over 1,500 times smaller or around 0.15 μas. Thus, astrometric precisions of order a
mas or a μas are needed to detect gas giants or terrestrial planets, respectively. Since astrometry
is most sensitive to planets orbiting the nearest stars, which have typical proper motions of
∼mas/year and annual parallactic motion of ∼mas, the target stars typically move by
more times the required measurement precision over the course of a year and secularly at
times the measurement precision per decade.
The photon limit of an astrometric measurement of a star depends on the signal-to-noise
ratio and width of the point spread function (PSF), and scales as σAST ∼FWHM/
√
N, where
N is the total number of photons in the measurement. As mentioned previously, diffraction-
limited PSFs, FWHM ∼λ/D, where D is either the aperture of the telescope or the baseline
of the interferometer. Baselines of ≲100 m therefore yield single-measurement precisions of
≲4 mas. Therefore, the astrometric detection of planets generally relies on the ability to achieve
both nearly photon-limited performance when measuring the centroid of individual images
and the ability to average many individual measurements to improve the final precision. As is
the case with RV, excellent control of systematics is therefore required. There are a num-
ber of ways to achieve this, depending on the nature of the observing setup (direct imaging,
interferometry, etc.).
Interferometricmethods in particularallow precisions below 1 mas from the ground around
bright stars with good, nearby reference stars, putting astrometric exoplanet detection within
reach. Much better control of systematics is in principle possible from space, and thus, space-
based interferometersshould be able to achieve precisions of 1–10 μas, making them a potential
route for the detection of nearby true Earth analogues (Unwin et al. 2008).

2.3 Imaging
The flux ratio of a planet (or planet/star contrast) at a given wavelength λ and epoch can be
expressed as fλ = f,λΦ(α), where Φ(α) describes the phase curve, whose form depends on
the properties of the planet atmosphere, and is a function of the phase angle α, which in turn
depends on the measurement epoch and orbital elements e, ωp, i, T, P. The phase curve typ-
ically takes on values ≲1, and thus the magnitude of the reflected light signal is characterized
by f,λ. This factor depends on the nature of the planetary emission, but for reflected light and
thermal emission it takes the form (see ( > 10.26) and ( > 10.27))

Here, g = [N−∑k Φ(αk)]
/is the root mean square of the phase function values at the
times k of the observations, and σeff is the average effective per-measurement photon noise
uncertainty normalized to the total stellar flux. In the usual background-limited case, the pri-
mary contributions to the uncertainty are residual light from the stellar point spread function,
and local and exozodiacal light. In the case where the scattered light from the star is dominant,
σeff ∼
√
C/N∗(Kasdin et al. 2003), where C is the contrast ratio between the intensity of the
scattered light from the star in the wings of the point spread function relative to the peak and
N∗is the total number of photons collected from the star in the measurement.
In contrast to many radial velocity and astrometric surveys, direct imaging surveys are gen-
erally designed with the requirement that such target signal-to-noise ratio per measurement is
≳1 (Kasdin et al.), and thus N ∼. Achieving a sufficient S/N per measurement then typically
translates into a requirement that C ≲f,λ, i.e., the flux from the planet within a given aperture
is larger than the local background from the stellar PSF in the same aperture.
Young (<1 Gyr old), self-luminous planets can still be quite warm (1,000–2,000 K), even at
arbitrarily large separations from their parent stars, making them in some sense the easiest tar-
gets for direct imaging surveys. For these temperaturesand roughly Jupiter radii, the planet/star
flux ratios are f,λ ∼−–−at near-IR wavelengths or Δm ∼10–15 mag. Purely in terms of
overall brightness, young exoplanets are rather easily detectable with large telescopes at infrared
wavelengths; the primary difficulty therefore lies in suppressing the residual starlight at the posi-
tion of the planet in order to achieve the contrast ratios C needed to distinguish the planetary
light from the star’s.
Since the albedos of exoplanets at distances of ≳0.1 AU are typically expected to be of order
unity, the flux ratio of a planet in reflected starlight is f,λ ∼(Rp/a). For a Jupiter analogue,
this is ∼−or about 20 mag, whereas for an Earth analogue, this is ∼−or about 23 mag.
The bolometric thermal flux ratio of an exoplanet in equilibrium with the starlight will be of the

508 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
same order of magnitude as the reflected light flux ratio; however, the monochromatic thermal
flux ratio may be substantially larger, since the planet is cooler, and so, its thermal emission
will peak in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the stellar blackbody emission. For a Jupiter analogue at
∼μm, f,λ ∼−, whereas for a Earth analogue, it is f,λ ∼−.
Achieving a given contrast ratio is generally more difficult for small angular separations
from the host star and becomes generally impossible closer than some minimum inner work-
ing angle, θIWA. Thus, the angular separation Δθ = r⊥/d is another important parameter that
determines the detectability of planets by direct imaging. The probability distribution of the
projected separation r⊥given a value of a for random orbital phases and viewing geometries is
generally sharply peaked at a. Thus, the typical angular separation of a planet with a = .AU
orbiting a star at 20 pc is ∼a/d = mas, whereas it is mas for a = AU. The inner working
angle typically scales as (and is generally similar to) the diffraction limit of telescope
θdiff ∼λ/D,
(10.52)
where D is the diameter of the telescope (or the most widely-separated components of an inter-
ferometer). This corresponds to 60 mas at 2 μm on an 8 m telescope. Thus, surveys for Earth
analogues are generally only feasible for the nearest stars.
The detectability of a planet by direct imaging depends on a complicated interplay between
many variables, including the semimajor axis and size of the planet, age and distance to the star,
and wavelength and capabilities of the imaging system. For example, for reflected light sur-
veys, the orbital separation effects the detectability of the planet through the opposing effects
of contrast and angular separation. As another example, while younger planets tend to be more
luminous, younger stars are also less common and so typically more distant. Additional fac-
tors may also contribute to these interplays, such as the brightness of the exozodiacal light as a
function of semimajor axis and variations in the planetary atmospheric properties (e.g., albedo
and absorption bands) as a function of semimajor axis, age, and surface gravity. Direct imag-
ing surveys therefore need to be designed carefully in order to maximize the discovery space
and so chance of success. Combined with the technical challenges associated with achieving the
contrast ratios and inner working angles needed for planet detection briefly described below,
it is clear that direct imaging is a generally expensive and challenging detection method. Nev-
ertheless, the potential payoff is enormous, particularly when considering the goal of directly
imaging Earth analogues.
The technical aspects of imaging exoplanets comprise surmounting three challenges: cor-
ralling starlight into a nearly diffraction-limited PSF (and away from the planet image),
mechanically blocking the starlight before it can diffract into the planet image, and subtract-
ing the remaining starlight at the position of the planet image on the detector to reveal the
planet image beneath. These three challenges are most forcefully attacked using adaptive optics,
coronagraphy, and various forms differential imaging, respectively.
Adaptive optics (AO) refers to controlling the wavefronts of the incoming starlight and
planet light, which ideally consist of parallel planes propagating toward the telescope. The atmo-
sphere and telescope optics both introduce aberrations to this wavefront which result in a PSF
that differs significantly from that which a theoretically perfect optical system would produce
(for an unocculted circular aperture, this would be an airy function). For most ground-based
telescopes, the primary source of wavefront aberrations is the atmosphere. Adaptive optics use
movable or deformable mirrors which can be rapidly actuated in response to measured atmo-
spheric aberrations, usually at tens to thousands of Hertz. These systems dramatically reduce
the effects of atmospheric blurring, and the best of them can collect most of a star’s light into

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
509
the shape dictated by optical diffraction. This heightens the peak of faint sources and reduces
noise from the star outside the diffraction limit.
The technique of blocking the light of a bright source to reveal faint surrounding features
is called coronagraphy. A coronagraph uses a series of masks in an optical system to block,
reorganize, or alter the phase of incoming light such that “on-axis” light from the star is almost
entirely blocked or caused to destructively interfere, while “off-axis” light (for instance, from
a nearby planet) is relatively unaffected. Because important aspects of this technique happen
in the pupil plane, stellar photons can be distinguished from planetary photons and rejected
before they arrive on the same pixels on the detector. The effect is to reduce the contamination
from stellar photons at the detector position of the planet, enhancing its detectability outside of
the diffraction limit. There has been a proliferation of coronagraph designs in recent years, but
they share the common feature of reducing or controlling the nature of the diffraction of the
light into the planet image.
Adaptive optics systems and coronagraphs are not perfect. Their limitations, the aberrations
introduced by the telescope, and diffraction spikes and rings from the aperture can result in sig-
nificant amounts of starlight outside of the diffraction limit. The most insidious of these effects is
the semi-static patterns of “speckles” from residual wavefront errors. Differential imaging is the
process of precisely determining the PSF of the starlight and attempting to subtract it, leaving
only the planet light to be detected. In principle, differential imaging is limited by the quality of
the model PSF and the unavoidable photon noise in the residuals to that model. The reference
image being subtracted can be determined from a reference star (RDI) or from the data them-
selves through angular modulation (ADI), spectral analysis (SDI), polarization analysis (PDI),
or other some other method or combination of methods.
A conceptual cousin of coronagraphy is interferometry, which allows widely separated aper-
tures to combine incoming light to form interference fringes whose amplitudes and phases are
sensitive to the presence of faint, off-axis companions. Such work is common at radio wave-
lengths and in the infrared, can be especially profitable just inside of the traditional diffraction
limit of the telescope. Two such techniques are aperture masking interferometry, where a single
telescope pupil is divided into small sub-apertures and the light is combined at the focal plane,
and nulling interferometry where light from two telescopes is combined such that the starlight
undergoes destructive interference, while the planet light, incoming at a slightly different angle,
interferes constructively.
2.4 Transits
The fractional change in the flux of a star when it is transited by a planetary companion has the
form ΔF∗/F∗= −δ F(t; Rp, M∗, R∗, a, i, e, ωp), where δ = kis the square of the planet/star
radius ratio and the function F(t) describes the detailed shape of the transit curve, and also
generally depends on the surface brightness profile of the star. In the case of circular orbits, no
limb darkening, and Rp ≪R∗, the form for F(t) can be approximated by a box car with a depth
of unity and duration of T = Teq(−b)/, where Teq and b are the equatorial crossing time
and impact parameter, respectively, as defined in >Sect. 1.5. The fraction of time the planet is
in transit (the transit duty cycle) is then ftr = T/P.
Transit surveys generally operate by obtaining many observations of the target stars over a
given time span. Of course, in order to be detectable, a planet must be favorably aligned such
that it transits. The transit probability is roughly Ptr ∼R∗/a. Then, assuming uniform sampling

over a time span that is long compared to P, the signal-to-noise ratio of the transit when folded
about the correct planet period is
(S/N)tr ≃
√
N ftr δ

,
(10.53)
where N is the total number of observations and σph is the fractional photometric uncertainty.
Therefore, the probability of detecting a given planet via transits can be roughly quantified by

For a typical hot Jupiter with Rp ≃RJ and P ≃days orbiting a solar-type star, the transit
probability is Ptr ∼%, the transit depth is δ ∼%, and the duty cycle is ftr ∼%. These param-
eters place Hot Jupiters well within the capabilities of ground-based surveys, although the
requirements are not trivial. First, since Hot Jupiters are only found around ∼0.5% of solar-type
stars (Gould et al. 2006), many thousands of stars must be surveyed to guarantee a transit-
ing Hot Jupiter. Obtaining relative photometry at precisions of less than a few millimagnitudes
for thousands of stars simultaneously from the ground is generally difficult, and thus ground-
based transit surveys operate close to the limit where δ/σph ∼. Therefore, hundreds of epochs
during transit are needed for robust detections, corresponding to many thousands of total mea-
surements. Aliasing effects arising from the diurnal constraints make achieving the required
number of points in transit more challenging. All of these requirements are most easily met
with relatively small aperture but very wide field-of-view telescopes (e.g., Pepper et al. 2003;
Bakos et al. 2004; Pollacco et al. 2006; McCullough et al. 2005).
In fact, finding transiting planets in wide-field surveys has proven even more difficult than
simply meeting these (already difficult) requirements. First, wide-field transit surveys must con-
tend with a huge fraction of false positives in the form of grazing eclipsing binaries (EBs),
eclipsing binaries blended with brighter stars, and more exotic variables. Furthermore, even
those signals that are consistent with a Jupiter-sized transiting object can, in principle, be much
more massive companions, since the radius of compact objects is essentially constant from the
mass of Saturn through ∼.M⊙(e.g., Burrows et al. 1997). Thus radial velocity follow-up is
needed toeliminate these false positives. Finally, high-precision (few m/s)radial velocityfollow-
up is needed to precisely measure the planet mass. The most successful searches achieve reliably
high photometric accuracy over large fields and employ multiple sites with good longitudinal
coverage, sophisticated and automated transit identification algorithms, and thorough follow-
up campaigns that use multiband photometry, multi-band astrometry (to rule out close, chance
alignments of EBs and foreground stars) , and radial velocity work. Further characterization of
a transiting planet is most successfully done using photometry and high signal-to-noise ratio
spectroscopy with larger ground and/or space telescopes.
The requirements forthe detection ofEarth analogues orbiting solar-type stars are especially
challenging. In this case, the fractional transit depth is ∼−, the transit probability is ∼0.5%,
and the duty cycle is ∼0.1% (i.e., the planet transits for T ≲h once a year). The detection
of transiting Earth analogues requires essentially continuous observations of hundreds of stars,
and precisions of better than ∼0.1 mmag for periods of several years. These requirements can-
not be met from the ground and require space-based photometric monitoring. Indeed, the
Kepler mission was designed to detect such planets, achieving the required photometric pre-
cision to detect Earth-sized planets on tens of thousands of stars (Borucki et al. 2010, see
also >Sect. 5.3.2).

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
511
Transiting planets can also be found via photometric follow-up of known radial velocity
companions; indeed, the first transiting planet was discovered in this way (Henry et al. 2000;
Charbonneau et al. 2000). Here, the challenges are somewhat different than the “traditional”
method of discovering transiting planets through their photometric signature. First, the prob-
ability that a given radial velocity companion will also transit its parent star is low, ≲10%.
Second, radial velocity searches have traditionally been limited to relatively bright stars, and
so the total number of stars have targeted for precision RV searches is ∼, making the total
yield of transiting planets from this sample also low. Furthermore, achieving photometry at
the level of precision needed to detect the transit signature may be challenging for very bright
stars, primarily because of the lack of suitable comparison stars. Finally, the uncertainties in the
predicted times of inferior conjunction from the radial velocity fits can be quite large, from sev-
eral hours to several days. Nevertheless, seven transiting systems have been discovered among
the sample of companions first discovered via radial velocity, and there are ongoing projects
that aim to increase this sample by first refining the radial velocity emphemerides of promising
systems, and then performing photometric follow-up (Kane et al. 2009).
2.5 Microlensing
Unlike the detection methods discussed above, the signals caused by planetary companions in
microlensing events cannot be described analytically except in a few specific limits that are not
generally applicable. Nevertheless, we can provide some qualitative guidelines and approximate
scaling behaviors that will elucidate the general requirements for successful surveys for planets
with microlensing. We stress that, because of the large diversity in the properties of the systems
that give rise to gravitational microlensing events, the expressions provided should be treated
as very rough estimates only.
A somewhat unusual attribute of the microlensing method is that the magnitude of a
microlensing perturbation does not depend on the properties of the planet in the general case.
Rather, the magnitude depends primarily on the angular separation of the planet from the
image(s) it is perturbing. However, the duration of the planetary perturbation does depend
on the planet properties, in particular, the mass ratio q. Very approximately, the duration of the
planetary deviation is Δtp ∼q/tE, where tE is the primary event time scale. The primary event
light curves must be sampled on a time scale significantlysmallerthan Δtp in ordertodetect and
characterize the planetary perturbation. Furthermore, the detection probability also depends
on the planet-mass ratio, such that Pdet ∼%(q/.)∼/(Horne et al. 2009). This detection
probability is averaged over a uniform distribution of impact parameters and is appropriate for
planets with projected separations that are within a factor of ∼2.6 of the Einstein ring radius,
r⊥∼[.−.]dθE, sometimes called the “lensing zone.” Planets with separations much smaller
or much larger than this range have substantially lower probability of detection. As discussed
in the context of direct imaging, the distribution of projected separation r⊥for random viewing
geometries and orbital phase is sharply peaked at r⊥∼a.
In addition, there is a minimum massthat can be detectedin microlensing surveys that is set
by the finite size of the source stars. When the angular size of the planet perturbation region is
substantiallysmallerthan the angularsize ofthe source, the planet perturbs onlya small fraction
of the source and the magnitude of the resulting deviation is strongly suppressed. A rough limit
on the mass ratio can be established when the angular size of the source θ∗is a factor of ∼3 times
larger than the angular Einstein ring radius of the planet θ p = q/θE, corresponding to roughly

512 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
an order-of-magnitude suppression of the planet signal. Thus, qmin ∼.ρ
∗, where ρ∗≡θ∗/θE
(Gould and Gaucherel 1997).
Thus, the parameters that determine the detectability of planets with microlensing are
Δtp ∼( Mp

/
tE,
Pdet ∼% ( Mp/M∗

a ∼[.−.]dθE,
qmin ∼.ρ
∗,
(10.55)
where the parameters tE and ρ∗additionally depend on the mass and distance to the host star
via the angular Einstein ring radius (see ( > 10.38)). The distributions of M∗, tE, d, and θE for
microlensing events toward the Galactic bulge are quite broad, but we can take typical values of
M∗≃.M⊙, tE ≃days, d ∼kpc, and θE ∼.mas. Thus, microlensing planet surveys are
most sensitive to planets with semimajor axes of a ≃[−] AU(M/.M⊙)/. For a Jupiter-
mass planet, the typical planet perturbation duration is Δtp ∼day and the typical detection
probability is ∼30% in the lensing zone. For an Earth-mass planet, Δtp ∼.h, whereas the
detection probability in the lensing zone is ∼1%.
The typical dimensionless source size for a clump giant star (∼13 R⊙) in the Galactic bulge
is ρ∗∼., whereas for a turnoff star (∼R⊙), it is ∼0.001. Thus, the minimum mass ratio that
can be detected by monitoring clump giant sources is qmin ∼−, corresponding to ∼.×
mass of the Earth for a typical primary lens of .M⊙. For main-sequence stars in the bulge,
qmin ∼−corresponding to just over the mass of the Moon! Thus, detecting planets with mass
of the Earth or less requires monitoring main-sequence stars. The difficulty lies in the fact, in
the crowded fields toward the Galactic bulge, most main-sequence stars are severely blended
with other unrelated background stars in typical ground-based seeing conditions, dramatically
increasing the photometric noise. Therefore, detecting planets with mass substantially less than
that ofthe Earth generallyrequires a space-based survey(Bennett and Rhie 2002; Bennett 2008).
A final difficulty within microlensing surveys is the low overall event rate of gravitational
microlensing events. Toward the Galactic bulge, the rate of microlensing events is roughly
Γ ∼−per star per year (e.g., Kiraga and Paczynski 1994). Thus, in order to detect ∼
events per year (the current number of microlensing events that are detected per year toward
the Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) collaboration3), of
order 100 million source stars must be monitored. There are 3 million stars per square degree
down to an I magnitude of 19 in Baade’s window (Holtzman et al. 1998), where I ∼is roughly
the peak of the distribution of baseline magnitudes for microlensing events. Thus, several tens
of square degrees of the bulge must be monitored.
The unpredictability of microlensing events requires monitoring the potential source stars
with a cadence that is substantially smaller than the timescale of interest. For the primary
microlensing events, which have a typical tE ∼days, this means roughly daily observa-
tions. Detecting the planetary perturbations on these events requires much higher cadences
of a few hours or less. Furthermore, since the total durations of the planetary perturbations are
of order a day or less, networks of longitudinally distributed telescopes must be employed in
order to avoid missing part or all of the perturbations. Given these requirements, traditional
microlensing planet surveys have used a two-tier approach, where collaborations with dedi-
cated access to telescopes with a relatively wide fields of view of ∼0.5–2 square degrees monitor
the tens of square degrees needed to detect the primary microlensing events, but with cadences
that are generally insufficient to detect planetary perturbations on these events (Udalski 2003;
3See http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/ews.html.

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
513
Sako et al. 2008). These survey collaborations alert the microlensing events real time before
the peak magnification, thus allowing “follow-up” collaborations with access to narrow-angle
telescopes on several continents to monitor only a subset of the stars that display ongoing
microlensing events with the cadences needed to detect planetary perturbations (Albrow et al.
1998; Tsapras et al. 2009; Dominik et al. 2010; Gould et al. 2010). Future surveys will operate
on a very different principle, as described in >Sect. 5.3.3.
2.6 Timing
The magnitude of the signal in other planet detection techniques varies. Timing for millisecond
pulsars like PSR 1257+12 can in principle detect extremely low-mass objects (significantly
<1 M⊕) given a sufficient amount of data, limited primarily by pulsar timing noise.
Other timing techniques, such as eclipsing binary times or pulsating hot subdwarfs, rely on
timing variations being correctlyinterpreted as a light-travel time effect ofa starorstellarsystem
orbiting a common center of mass with an unseen companion. A summary of such detections is
listed in Schuh (2010); most of these detections imply minimum companion masses of several
times that of Jupiter. The sensitivities of these methods is difficult to determine, however, since
they depend on the magnitude of all non-orbital origins in timing variations, which have not
been well quantified. Most of the current detections are of fewer than two full apparent orbits
(periods are 3–16 years), and so, the strict periodicity that is characteristic of Keplerian signals
cannot yet be confirmed. Further, quasi-cyclical timing variations may be generated by poorly
understood internal mechanisms such as the “Applegate effect” (Applegate 1992). Following
these apparent planetary systems for multiple orbits will help illuminate the true sensitivities of
these methods.
Transit timing variations (TTVs) provide an extremely sensitive method of detecting new
planets or characterizing known planets in a transiting system. The sensitivity is a complex
function of the orbital parameters of the planets involved but is optimized when the planets
are in mean-motion resonances (Veras et al. 2011). Kepler is sufficiently precise in its timing to
measure variations of order minutes in the ingress and egress times of transiting planets, which
in principle allows it to reach mass precisions of order 1 M⊕over several years of observation.
In known multi-transit systems, these variations can be used to infer the massesof the plan-
ets involved (e.g., Lissauer et al. 2011), and in apparently single systems, they can be used to
detect non-transiting planets (e.g., Ballard et al. 2011). Ground-based planet transit timing will
generally be limited to precisions of a tens of minutes and so have correspondingly weaker
sensitivities.

Comparisons of the Methods
In the previous sections, we reviewed the primary exoplanet detection methods in some detail,
outlining the principles of each method, including the primary physical observables and practi-
cal challenges associated with achieving robust detections. In this section, we place these discus-
sions in the context of the larger goal of constraining exoplanet demographics by outlining the
regions ofplanet and host starparameterspace where each method is most sensitive. When then
compare the methods with one anotherin this context, highlighting the strong complementarity

The points show the masses versus semimajor axis in units of the snow line distance for the
exoplanets that have been discovered by various methods as of 12/2011. See the Extrasolar Plan-
ets Encyclopedia (http://exoplanet.eu/) and the Exoplanet Data Explorer (http://exoplanets.org/).
Here, we have taken the snow line distance to be asl = 2.7 AU(M∗/M⊙). Radial velocity detec-
tions (here, what is actually plotted is Mp sin i) are indicated by red circles (blue for those also
known to be transiting), transit detections are indicated by blue triangles if detected from the

methods, demonstrating their complementarity (Adapted from Gaudi 2012)
ofthe methods. We alsobrieflydiscuss and compare how the intrinsicsensitivityofeach method
to planets in the Habitable Zones of their parent stars scales with host star mass.
The sensitivity of the various detection methods as a function of planet mass and sepa-
ration is illustrated in >Fig. 10-5. We show the masses and semimajor axes of the exoplanets
discovered by radial velocities, direct imaging, timing, transits, and microlensing as of 12/2011.

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
515
In addition, we show estimates of the sensitivity of various surveys using radial velocities, direct
imaging, transits, microlensing, and astrometry. In the following subsection, we explain the
scaling of these survey sensitivities with planet parameters and explain our specific choice for
their normalization. Host star mass is a third parameter that can strongly influence the sensitiv-
ity of these methods but is suppressed in this figure. Therefore, in order to provide a somewhat
fairer comparison across the broad range of host star masses represented in this figure, we nor-
malize the semimajor axis by an estimate of the snow line distance (e.g., Kennedy and Kenyon
2008),
asl = .AU M∗
M⊙
.
(10.56)
The snow line is the location in the protoplanetary disk where the temperatureis below the sub-
limation temperature of water. In the currently favored paradigm of planet formation, the snow
line distance plays an important role, as the larger surface density of solids beyond the snow line
facilitates giant planet formation, whereas primarily rocky planets are expected to form interior
to the snow line (e.g., Lissauer 1987; Pollack et al. 1996; Ida and Lin 2004; Mordasini et al. 2009).
Both the locations of the known planets and the regions of sensitivity in >Fig. 10-5 serve to
illustrate the complementarity of the various detection methods. In particular, radial velocity
and transit surveys are most sensitive to relatively short-period exoplanets with separations
interior to the snow line. State-of-the-art surveys using these methods are sensitive to planets
as small as the Earth. In contrast, direct imaging and microlensing surveys are most sensitive
to planets beyond the snow line. Current direct imaging surveys are sensitive to very widely
separated, massive planets. Current and near-term microlensing surveys are sensitive to planets
with massesgreater than that of the Earth, whereas a space-based microlensing survey would be
sensitive to planets with mass greater than that of Mars and separations greater than a few AU,
including free-floating planets. The combined sensitivity of current and proposed surveys using
the methods discussed in the chapter encompasses an extremely broad volume of parameter
space, including planets with masses greater than that of the Earth for arbitrary separations
(including free-floating planets), host stars with masses from the bottom of main sequence to
several times the mass of the Sun, and distances from the solar neighborhood to the Galactic
center. Thus, the full complement of these methods can potentially provide a nearly complete
picture of the demographics of exoplanets.
3.1 Sensitivities of the Methods

Radial Velocities. The radial velocity signal and signal-to-noise ratio scale as
(S/N)RV ∝MpP−/M−/
∗
∝Mpa−/M−/
∗
.
(10.57)
Thus, at fixed host star mass, RV surveys are generally more sensitive to more massive
planets and have a weak preference for shorter-period planets, at least for periods shorter
than the span of the measurements. At fixed S/N, the minimum detectable mass scales
as Mp,min ∝P/M/
∗
∝a/M/
∗. This mass limit is shown in > Fig. 10-5 assuming
M∗= M⊙and a minimum detectable RV signal of K ∼m/s (i.e., corresponding to a
(S/N)RV ∼detection with 100 observations each with single measurement precisions
of ∼1 m/s). In principle, sufficiently massive planets can be detected even when they have
periods longer than the duration of observations; however, it will generally not be possible

516 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
to uniquely measure Mp sin i and P in these cases, and thus the usefulness of such “detec-
tions” is significantly compromised. Therefore, we simply assume an upper limit on the
period of P = 2,000 days.
At fixed planet properties, the RV signal increases with decreasing host star masses as
M−/
∗
. However, there are many additional factors that enter into the overall detectabil-
ity as a function of mass, through the radial velocity uncertainty σRV. At fixed distance to
the host star, the velocity uncertainty due to photon noise increases with decreasing mass
for main-sequence stars, both because of the strong mass-bolometric luminosity relation
for main-sequence stars and because of the difficulties of continuum normalization in very
cool stars, where most RV surveys are carried out. The intrinsic velocity information in stel-
lar spectra also varies as a function of spectral type. In particular, hot (Teff ≳6,500 K) stars
have few spectral lines and typically rotate much more rapidly than cooler stars with con-
vective envelopes. Finally, the astrophysical radial velocity noise (i.e., “jitter” due to spots)
also depends on spectral type and stellar age (Wright 2005). When taken together, these
factors tend to favor late G or early K quiet main-sequence stars as the most promising for
detecting low-mass planets (e.g., Pepe et al. 2011).
•
Astrometry. The astrometric signal and signal-to-noise ratio scale as
(S/N)AST ∝MpP/M−/
∗
d−∝MpaM−
∗d−,
(10.58)
and so, at fixed stellar mass, astrometric surveys are more sensitive to massive, long-period
planets. At fixed S/N, the minimum detectable mass scales as Mp,min ∝P−/M/
∗d ∝
a−M∗d. This limit is shown in >Fig. 10-5 assuming M∗= M⊙and d = pc, and a min-
imum detectable astrometric signal θ∗≃.μas (i.e., a (S/N)AST ∼detection with 200
2-D observations each with σAST ∼μas precision). As with radial velocity observations,
although it is possible to detect the astrometric signal of planets with period larger than the
duration of observations, it is generally not possible to independently measure the mass and
orbital parameters with observations that do not cover a complete orbit. This is particularly
problematic for astrometric observations, because in this regime, the signal of the proper
motion of the star is partially degenerate with the astrometric signal of the planetary com-
panion. Astrometric surveys are therefore expected to have the most sensitivity to planets
with periods similar to the survey duration, and increasing the survey duration has a strong
effect on the survey yield.
At fixed planet properties and host star distance, the astrometric signal increases with
decreasing host star mass as M−/
∗
. Stellar spots are generally not expected to be an
important source of astrometric noise (Makarov et al. 2009), and thus, the only additional
dependence of the sensitivity of astrometric surveys on stellar mass enters through the
effects of the typical distance and photon noise uncertainty of the host stars. Specifically,
low-mass stars are more common and thus have a smaller typical distance but are less
luminous and thus yield poorer astrometric precision.

where the last two forms again assume observations in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail. The other
primary requirement for direct imaging is that the angular separation between the planet
and star is larger than inner working angle, and thus a ≳θIWAd−. Thus, at fixed primary
properties and distance, larger and hotter planets are more readily detectable. As discussed
in >Sect. 2.3, the dependence of detectability on semimajor axis is not trivial: planets with
larger orbits generally have smaller flux ratios; however, they must have an angular separa-
tion greater than the inner working angle to be detectable. Furthermore, additional effects
that are likely to depend on the planet semimajor axis may affect the detectability, such as
the variation of the planetary albedo with separation.
At fixed planet properties, the signal-to-noise ratio with which a planet can be detected
in reflected light is largely independent of the host star properties. For detection in thermal
emission, larger and/or hotter host stars generally give rise to smaller flux ratios. The other
effect of host star mass enters through the dependence on distance: less massive host stars
are more numerous and so have a smaller average distance, whereas more massive host stars
are more luminous and thus give rise to smaller photon noise uncertainties at fixed distance.
Finally, the age of the host star plays an important role in the detectability of planets, par-
ticularly with current surveys: young, self-luminous planets have flux ratios that are both
larger than would be expected for planets whose emission is dominated by reflected light
or equilibrium thermal emission and are independent of their semimajor axis. Thus, rela-
tively luminous planets with separations well beyond the inner working angle can be found
around young stars.
Current ground-based imaging surveys are most sensitive to young, massive (Mp ≳
MJUP), self-luminous planets with semimajoraxes of ≳10 AU around the nearest stars. Thus,
these surveys are sensitive to planets in a regime of parameter space that is not currently
being probed by other methods. We illustrate the current region of sensitivity of imag-
ing surveys in > Fig. 10-5, assuming planets with Mp ≳MJUP and a ≳AU can be
detected. Future surveys (some of which will be initiated very soon) will be sensitive to
a much broader region of planet parameter space.
•
Transits. Assuming uniformly sampled observations over a time span T that is long com-
pared to the planet period, the signal-to-noise ratio with which a transiting planet can be
detected scales as
(S/N)tr ∝R
pP−/M−/
∗
∝R
pa−/M−/
∗
,
(10.62)
where we have assumed R∗∝M∗as appropriate for stars on the main sequence with
M ≲M⊙. In addition, the transit probability scales as Ptr ∝P−/M/
∗
∝a−M∗, and
the requirement to detect at least n transits sets a strict lower limit on the period P ≤T/n.
Thus, for fixed host star properties, the sensitivity of transit surveys is strongly weighted
toward short-period, large-radius planets. At fixed S/N, the minimum detectable planet
radius scales as Rp,min ∝P/M/
∗
∝a/M/
∗. For planets with a constant density, this
translates into a minimum mass of Mp,min ∝R
p,min ∝P/M/
∗
∝a/M/
∗. This limit is
shown in >Fig. 10-5, assuming a minimum (S/N)tr = and a midlatitude transit and pho-
ton noise-limited precision for a M∗= M⊙, V = star from Kepler (Gilliland et al. 2011).
The relatively strong dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on planet radius, combined
with the decreasing transit probability with increasing planet period, generally implies that
the yield of a transit survey is a relatively weak function of the total duration T.
Main-sequence stars are clearlythe best targets fortransit searches. At fixed planet radius
and period, low-mass main-sequence stars yield larger transit signals. However, for photon

518 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
noise-limited uncertainties, the signal-to-noise ratio also depends on the stellar luminosity
in the wavelength of the observation and the distance to the star. Low-mass stars are more
common and are therefore closer on average. These net results of these various counter-
vailing effects on the scaling of the sensitivity of transit surveys with host star mass depend
on the survey parameters, particularly the wavelength, target field, and magnitude limit
(Pepper and Gaudi 2005). All-sky surveys in the visual at fairly bright magnitudes tend to
be dominated by F and G stars (Pepper et al. 2003), but surveys for fainter stars, or surveys
in near-IR wavelengths, tend to be more heavily weighted to toward low-mass stars.
•
Microlensing. As discussed previously, microlensing surveys are less amenable to analytic
characterization of the sensitivity and scaling with planet and host star parameters. Never-
theless, we have the general qualitative result that the sensitivity peaks for semimajor axes
that are similar to the Einstein ring of the host star lens, aopt ∼.AU(M∗/.M⊙)/.
Both the detection probability at fixed semimajor axis and range of sensitivity around
this peak increases for larger mass ratio. The range of planet mass and semimajor axis to
which a given microlensing survey is most sensitive depends on the details of the survey
design, in particular the number and peak magnification of the primary events that are
monitored, and the precision and cadence of the observations. In > Fig. 10-5, we show
representative estimates for the sensitivity of a current ground-based microlensing sur-
vey based on the analysis of Gould et al. (2010), a next-generation ground-based survey
as described in > Sect. 5.3.3, and a space-based survey similar to WFIRST as described
Green et al. (2011). Generally, current microlensing surveys are most sensitive to planets
with Mp ≳M⊕, with separations just beyond the snow line spanning a factor of a few in
semimajor axis. Next-generation ground-based surveys will lower the sensitivity in mass by
roughly an order of magnitude to Mp ≳M⊕and broaden the range of semimajor axis by a
factor of ∼2. A space-based survey would be sensitive to planets with mass greater than the
mass of Mars with separations greater than a few AU, including analogues to all of the Solar
System planets except Mercury.
Because microlensing does not rely on the detection of photons from the host star, the
sensitivity of a microlensing survey to the host star parameters enters primarily through
the microlensing event rate as a function of host star mass. The microlensing event rate is
given by the integral of the number density of lenses along the line of sight to the bulge,
weighted by the cross section for lensing, which depends on the host star Einstein ring
radius (∝M/
∗) and its projected transverse velocity. > Figure 10-6 shows a theoretical
estimate of the microlensing event rate toward the Galactic bulge, as a function of the lens
mass. The sensitivity of microlensing planet surveys is roughly proportional to this event
rate. Thus microlensing surveys are sensitive to main-sequence hosts with mass from below
the hydrogen-burning limit up to the turn off of the stellar population (∼M⊙) as well as
remnant hosts. The sensitivity to brown dwarf and main-sequence hosts is roughly constant
per log M∗.
3.2 Habitable Planets
Of particular interest is the detection of terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zones of their parent
stars. In >Sect. 2, we discussed the magnitude of the signal expected for an Earthlike planet sep-
arated by 1 AU from a solar-type star for various detection methods. These signals are generally
quite small. However, we can and should also consider the signals and detectability of Earthlike

The solid black curve shows the theoretical estimate of total event rate of microlensing events
toward the Galactic bulge from Gould (2000), as a function of the mass of the lens. This event
rate is decomposed into its contribution from main-sequence and brown dwarf lenses, white
dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as indicated. The sensitivity of microlensing planet surveys
is roughly proportional to this event rate (Adapted from Gould (2000), reproduced by permission

planets orbiting in the Habitable Zones of main-sequence stars with mass significantly different
than the Sun. Because the masses,radii, and luminosities of stars on the main sequence can span
an order of magnitude or more, both the location of the Habitable Zone and the magnitude of
the signal expected from an Earthlike habitable planet can vary substantially.
In this subsection, we derive the scaling of the detectability of Earthlike habitable planets
with host star mass. To this end, we adopt a power-law form for the stellar mass-bolometric
luminosity relation,
L∗

∼( M∗

.
(10.63)
Our adopted exponent of 4 roughly corresponds to that found from a weighted fit to the data
for benchmark binary systems analyzed in Torres et al. (2010). This form provides a reasonable
approximation of this data set over the full span of masses of ∼0.2–50 M⊙. We note, however,
that there are significant deviations from this form within the range, particularly for stars below
the fully convective boundary, which are generally more luminous that predicted by ( >10.63).
Nevertheless, we will adopt this simple form for the purposes of illustration. With this adopted
mass-luminosity relation, we can define the location of the Habitable Zone as

(10.64)
Therefore, the Habitable Zone location ranges from a semimajor axis of ∼0.01 AU and period
of ∼1 day for a star at the bottom of the main sequence to ∼4 AU and ∼6 years for a M∗∼M⊙
star. We adopt a mass-radius relation of the form

(10.65)
which describes the data in Torres et al. (2010) reasonably well for non-evolved stars with
M∗≲M⊙.
With these assumptions, we can now use the results from >Sect. 3.1 to derive the scaling of
the signal of a habitable planet with host star mass for the various methods we have discussed.
•
Radial Velocities. For radial velocity surveys, the radial velocity and signal-to-noise ratio
for planets in the Habitable Zone scale as
(S/N)RV ∝MpM−/
∗
(habitable).
(10.66)
Therefore, all else being equal, Habitable Zone planets are significantly easier to detect
around lower-mass stars. In particular, for stars with M ≲.M⊙, the radial velocity ampli-
tude foran Earth-mass planet in the Habitable Zone is expected tobe ≳1m/s, which is within
the reach of current instrumentation (Bean et al. 2010b).
•
Astrometry. The astrometric signal and signal-to-noise ratio for habitable planets scale as
(S/N)AST ∝MpM∗d−
(habitable),
(10.67)
and thus at fixed distance and planet-mass, astrometric surveys are more sensitive to habit-
able planets orbiting higher-mass stars, provided that the period of the planets is less than
the duration of the survey. In addition, higher-mass stars are more luminous and thus have
smaller photon noise uncertainties. On the other hand, higher-mass stars are also less com-
mon and thus are typically more distant. The net result of these factors is that A and F stars
are the most promising targets for astrometric searches for planets in the Habitable Zones
of nearby stars (Gould et al. 2003a).
•
Imaging. For direct detection of habitable planets in thermal equilibrium with their host
stars, the planet/star flux ratio and signal-to-noise ratio scale as
(S/N)dir ∝R
pM−
∗
(reflected, habitable),
(10.68)
(S/N)dir ∝R
pM−/
∗
(thermal, habitable),
(10.69)
strongly favoring low-mass stars. Note that, by definition, the amount of stellar irradiation
for a planet in the Habitable Zone is independent of the mass of host star, and thus for fixed
planet properties, the thermal or reflected flux of the planet is also independent of the mass
ofthe host star. The dependence on stellarmass in the above scaling relations therefore arises
simply from the change in the flux of the star. However, the second requirement for direct
detection is that the angular separation of the planet from its parent star must be larger than
the inner working angle of system. At fixed mass, this translates into a maximum distance
that a Habitable Zone planet can be detected,
dmax = pc( θIWA
mas)

(habitable).
(10.70)
The number of available targets is ∝n(M∗)d
max, where n(M∗) is the volume density of
stars of a given mass, i.e., the mass function. Since the exponent of the mass function in
the local solar neighborhood is generally ≳−, this requirement strongly favors high-mass
stars. The optimal mass will depend on the precise details of the survey and the nature of the

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
521
noise sources (see, e.g., Agol 2007), but these arguments demonstrate that we can generically
expect the sensitivity of imaging surveys for habitable planets to be fairly strongly peaked
at intermediate masses.
•
Transits. The signal-to-noise ratio, transit probability, and period of a transiting habitable
planet scale as
(S/N)tr ∝R
pM−/
∗
,
Ptr ∝M−
∗,
P ∝M/
∗,

(10.71)
all of which favor or strongly favor low-mass stars. Furthermore, as discussed above, the
radial velocity signals of Habitable Zone planets around low-mass stars are also larger and
within reach. Finally, low-mass stars are more common. These various considerations have
led to the suggestion that transit surveys of low-mass stars may be the most promising route
to detecting habitable Earthlike planets (Gould et al. 2003b; Nutzman and Charbonneau
2008; Blake et al. 2008). Indeed, several such surveys are underway or are being planned
(e.g., Charbonneau et al. 2009), with the ultimate goal of finding a Earthlike system whose
atmosphere can be characterized with, e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (Deming et al.
2009).
•
Microlensing. The system parameters which determine the detectability of a given plane-
tary system with gravitational microlensing are the mass ratio q and projected separation s
in units of rE. For a habitable Earthlike planet, these are
q ∼× −( Mp

(10.73)
where in the expression for sHZ, we have assumed a median projection factor such that
aHZ,⊥= .aHZ. Therefore, for typical microlensing host stars, the Habitable Zone dis-
tance is much smaller than the Einstein ring. While mass ratios of q ∼−are readily
detectable for planets with separations near the Einstein ring (s ∼), they are much more
difficult to detect for planets with s ≪. This is because these such planets can only be
detected when they perturb the inner image created by the primary host star, and then only
when this image is close to the primary and thus highly demagnified (see > Fig. 10-4).
These perturbations are therefore generally quite small. Furthermore, perturbations of the
inner image are more strongly suppressed for large source stars (Gould and Gaucherel 1997;
Bennett and Rhie 1996).
From ( > 10.73), we see that microlensing favors the detection of habitable plan-
ets around higher-mass stars (Di Stefano and Night 2008), and stars that are close to the
source or close to the Earth (i.e., such that x(−x) is small). While current and next-
generation ground-based microlensing surveys have essentially no sensitivity to habitable
Earthlike planets, specialized surveys for nearby microlensing events, or space-based sur-
veys which boast much larger event rates and detection efficiencies, could potentially detect
such systems (Di Stefano and Night 2008; Park et al. 2006; Bennett et al. 2010b; Green et al.
2011).

Early Milestones in the Detection of Exoplanets
4.1 Van de Kamp and Barnard’s Star
The pre-1995 literature is scattered with several (presumably) spurious claims of detections of
planets around nearby stars. Perhaps the best known early claim is that of van de Kamp, who
conducted an astrometric campaign to detect “dark” companions to nearby stars (van de Kamp
1986). Van de Kamp’s lower limits were impressive, typically ruling out Jupiter-mass objects in
periods of years to a couple decades, and he reported several stars as having barely detectable
companions of apparently substellar mass. Most intriguing was his report of first one, then later
two Jupiter-mass companions to Barnard’s star (GJ 699), the second closest stellar system to
Earth.
Van de Kamp made astrometric measurementsfrom the positions of the apparent centroids
of stellar images on photographic plates and targets such as Barnard’s star suffered from hav-
ing a constantly changing set of astrometric references over his multi-decade survey due to its
record-high proper motion (over 10′′/year). Subsequent astrometric and radial velocity work
have ruled out his claims (Choi et al. 2012, and references therein).
4.2 PSR 1257+12 and the Pulsar Planets
Pulsars are exquisite clocks, typically producing pulses with periods of order ∼1–−s. Once
these periods are corrected for well-measured linear drifts with time and occasional “glitches”
(sudden shifts in period), their precision can rival and even surpass the best atomic clocks on
Earth. Successful analysis of pulse arrival times requires carefully solving for the distance and
space motion of the pulsar and the removal of the effects of the motion of the observatory.
In 1991, two teams announced having contemporaneously observed unexplained residuals
to their timing models indicative of the first known exoplanets: very small, terrestrial planet
mass companions orbiting their pulsars. Matthew Bailes and Andrew Lyne (Bailes et al. 1991)
reported a timing variation with a period of 6 months apparently due to a 10 M⊕companion
orbiting the pulsar PSR 1829–10. Meanwhile, Cornell astronomer Alexander Wolszczan had
observed a similarsort ofsignal from a millisecond pulsar, PSR 1257+12, and had recruited Dale
Frail of the National Radio Astronomical Observatory to help confirm its position on the sky
to perfect the position model. By November 1991, Wolszczan and Frail (1992) had submitted
a manuscript on their discovery, and both teams planned to describe their work at the January
1992 meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
At the meeting, Lyne announced that just days earlier, he had discovered an error in his
timing model. A tiny positional error combined with an insufficiently precise description of
the Earth’s orbit had led to the small, periodic, 6 month signal in their residuals that they had
mistaken for a planet. With the correct timing model, there was no evidence of a planetary
perturber on the pulsar. Lyne’s public and frank admission was acknowledged as a laudable
demonstration of scientific integrity by a standing ovation at the meeting and an editorial in
Nature (Lyne and Bailes 1992; Nature 1992; Wolszczan 2012).
The world would not be long with its first exoplanets, however. The very next speaker at the
AAS meeting was Wolszczan, whose timing model had correctly accounted for all important
effects. Wolszczan described the first planets known outside the Solar System: a pair of bod-
ies with ∼4 M⊕orbiting the millisecond pulsar PSR 1257+12 with periods of 66 and 98 days.

This system would continue to impress, revealing a third low-mass planet to Wolszczan’s team,
as well (Wolszczan et al. 2000).
These planets’ formation mechanism is still not understood, and to date, no similar system
of low-mass planets is known. Signals of higher-mass planets orbiting pulsars would continue
to be found, however: in particular, Bailes would go on to discover an apparently high-density
1.4 MJup object orbiting pulsar PSR J1719-1438 (Bailes et al. 2011).
4.3 Early Radial Velocity Work
4.3.1 Campbell and Walker’s Survey and γ Cep Ab
In the 1981, Bruce Campbell of the University of Victoria, Gordon Walker of the University of
British Columbia, and their team began an ambitious survey for substellar objects orbiting 20
of the brightest nearby stars. They sought to exploit the recently available technologies of high-
resolution (R > 40,000) echelle spectrographs and digital detectors in the form of Reticons and
CCDs to achieve the best possible Doppler precision.
To establish an accurate and robust wavelength solution, they employed an absorption cell
of hydrogen fluoride (HF) which imposed a “picket fence” of regular, strong, narrow, and widely
spaced (∼15 Å) absorption lines from the →R branch transitions near 8,700 Å, far from any
telluric features (Campbell et al. 1988). Campbell and Walker had sought a chemical cell that
would provide such lines in the optical that would not contaminate the stellar lines and with few
extraneous absorption features from isotopic impurities or other effects. Campbell and Walker
found no other chemicals that fit their needs and so used HF despite the serious difficulties of
working with that chemical.4 To achieve the necessary optical depth and wavelength stability of
HF lines, Campbell and Walker stabilized the temperature and pressure of their 1-m-long cell
at 373 K and connected it to a vessel containing liquid HF in an ice bath, yielding a pressure of
roughly 0.5 atm.
The well-known and well-spaced HF lines granted Cambpell and Walker unprecedented
optical Doppler precision, independent of mechanical and thermal changes in the optics of
their spectrograph. This method was, at the time, greatly superior to emission line calibration
because the reference lines were measured simultaneously to the stellar exposure and through
the same optical path as the stellar photons. Campbell and Walker achieved 10–15 m/s radial
velocity precision on most of their sample of 20 stars. This precision is, in retrospect, more than
sufficient to detect close-in giant exoplanets, but their sample of stars was simply too small, and
close-in planets are too rare for them to have discovered a strong exoplanetary signal with any
significant likelihood.
Campbell et al. (1988) were able to confirm that objects with m sin i = –MJup are rare
and noted several interesting signals near the limits of their detectability. They noted an espe-
cially intriguing apparent signal for γ Cep A with a 25 m/s amplitude and 2.7-year period,
superimposed on a long-term acceleration from the star’s binary companion. The implication
of this periodicity was that γ Cep A was orbited by a ∼1.7 MJup mass planet at a few AU.
4Campbell and Walker understatedly reported the “obnoxious” nature of HF and that “standard safety pre-
cautions of chemical laboratories are appropriate” for this rather dangerous chemical which reacts with glass,
forms hydrofluoric acid on contact with water, can painlessly penetrate human tissues, and causes burns that
can necessitate amputation (OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Guidelines for HF, US Department of Labor,
2012).

Four years later, Walker et al. (1992) reported on their monitoring of the Ca ii 8,662 Å line
and determined that γ Cep had a weak 2.52-year activity period, uncomfortably close to the
purported planetary signal, and cautiously noted that the RV signal was likely due to stellar
activity.
Eleven years later, after nearly 100 bona fide exoplanets had been discovered by teams
around the world, Hatzes et al. (2003) announced RV monitoring at McDonald Observatory
had confirmed Campbell, Walker, and Young’s original detection: the variations were indeed
due to a m sin i = .MJup, P = .-year planet, and there was no longer any evidence of a
2.5-year activity period. In retrospect, Campbell and Walker’s planet search had been a sort of
success, after all. It had also inspired subsequent teams to continue their efforts (> Figs. 10-7
and >10-8).
4.3.2 Latham’s Survey and HD 114762 b
In 1988, David Latham of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and his team
described a new result from their precise radial velocity instrument, the CfA Digital Speedome-
ter at Oak Ridge Observatory. In 1984, Latham and Israeli astronomer Tsevi Mazeh had
conducted a short survey of about three dozen early M dwarfs for short-period, massive plan-
ets using this instrument but had found nothing (Latham 2012). For this new survey, Latham
et al. sought to further stabilize their spectrograph to achieve ∼100 m/s precision to measure
accurate binary orbits and improve the IAU system of radial velocity standards. Latham et al.
achieved this stabilization by removing the Cassegrain instrument from the telescope, stabiliz-
ing its temperature, and feeding it with a 100 μ optical fiber. This provided a constant gravity
vector, thermal and mechanical stability, and a (relatively) uniformly illuminated entrance slit,
robust against guiding errors.
On its first night of operation, Latham et al. (1989) observed several RV standard stars
including HD 114762. They noted a large (390 m/s) radial velocity discrepancy from the known
value. Curious, they compared their previous measurementsmade at lower precision and found
a highly significant signal at near 84 d with 530 m/s semiamplitude, corresponding to a 13 MJup
companion.

Subsequent observations at high precision confirmed the reality of the signal. Latham et al.
(1989) had discovered, serendipitously, on the first night of observation, and in a sample of
only seven objects, what today would be considered by many to be an exoplanet. At the time,
no objects with a mass anything like 13 MJup were known, and Latham et al. cautiously referred
to their object as “a probable brown dwarf”; however, they noted that the companion “might
even be a giant planet,”5 a point that was picked up by the media but criticized by many of their
colleagues (Latham 2012). Regardless of its taxonomic class, it was the first firm detection of a
substellar object beyond the Solar System and today is often included in catalogs of exoplanets
(e.g., Wright et al. 2011).
4.3.3 Marcy and Butler’s Iodine Survey
In 1992, Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler of San Francisco State University announced their
survey of 70 nearby stars using an iodine (I) cell for wavelength calibration. Previous Doppler
work by Marcy and Benitz (1989) had used ThAr emission lamps to search for brown dwarfs
5Later, the IAU would provisionally set the deuterium-burning limit for star-like objects, 13 MJup, as the border
between planets and brown dwarfs found in orbit around stars. This is useful for purposes of nomenclature
but bears little on issues of formation and composition, and today the distinction is not always honored.

orbiting nearby M dwarfs with radial velocity precision of ∼250 m/s; Marcy and Butler sought
to improve this precision by 1–2 orders of magnitude with their iodine cell and the CCD at the
high-resolution Hamilton spectrograph, designed by Vogt (1987).
Unlike Campbell and Walker, Marcy and Butler sought an absorption cell that would
provide absorption features throughout a broad region of wavelength space. Following Lib-
brecht (1988) (who had employed an iodine cell to study solar sunspots and had extended
their studies to p-mode measurements of stars), Marcy and Butler settled on iodine as the
ideal absorption gas. Their rationale was that this provided the wavelength reference at every
point in the spectrum, not just every 15 Å, and that the potentially problematic blending
of stellar features with iodine features could be modeled given a sufficiently accurate tem-
plate spectrum of the star and the iodine cell (the latter obtained with a Fourier transform
spectrograph).
Marcy and Butler further sought to model the variable instrumental profile of the spec-
trograph as a function of wavelength to account for the not-insubstantial thermal and
mechanical variations in the spectrograph and for the nonuniform illumination of the
entrance slit. Marcy and Butler’s sealed cell was ∼10 cm long, held at a constant 323 K, and
0.001 atm and had the further advantage that it was relatively easy to construct and its con-
tents were benign (indeed, medicinal!). Marcy and Butler (1992) reported that they had
achieved 25 m/s precision at the beginning of their survey and foresaw significant improve-
ment through more sophisticated instrumental profile modeling. Indeed, by 1996 Marcy and
Butler would demonstrate 3 m/s precision (Butler et al. 1996), and they and their collabora-
tors would go on to be responsible for over half of the exoplanets discovered over the next
15 years.
4.3.4 Hatzes and Cochran’s Survey and β Gem b
Hatzes and Cochran (1993) reported their results from precise Doppler monitoring of three
bright K giants as part of a broader planet detection effort. Their primary technique was to
use telluric (atmospheric) Obands as an absorption wavelength reference, which had been
reported by Griffin (1973) to be sufficiently stable to allow 10 m/s precision. They found that
typical long-term stabilities were more like 20 m/s. They had also begun employing an iodine
cell (Cochran and Hatzes 1993) and at this point had obtained a small number of iodine
observations.
Hatzes and Cochran found that all three K giants in their sample, Arcturus (α Boo), Alde-
baran (α Tau), and Pollux (β Gem), displayed large, periodic radial velocity variations with
semiamplitudes of 50–200 m/s. Comparison with prior radial velocities obtained by Cambpell’s
group (Walker et al. 1989) revealed that the variations were coherent over 10 years. While both
α Boo and α Tau showed significant day-to-day RV variations indicative of radial pulsation
modes and correlated variations in the 10,830 Å He i line, β Gem seemed to have a clean signal,
consistent with a 554 d planet with a minimum mass of 3 MJup.
Observations by the Canadian team (Larson et al. 1993) showed that the Ca ii 8,662 Å line
showed periodic variation at the same frequency as the RV variations (which they had measured
independently). This coincidence cast strong doubt on the planetaryinterpretation ofthe β Gem
RV variations, especially in light of the much larger and more clearly activity-related variations
in α Boo and α Tau.

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
527
Hatzes et al. (2006) combined literature data with subsequent iodine observations from
McDonald Observatory and Tautenburg Observatory to show that the RV variations continued
coherently into 2006 and that the Ca ii H and K lines showed no coincident variation. They con-
cluded that the variations in β Gem were likely due to a minimum mass 3 MJup companion with
period 590 d.
4.3.5 Mayor and Queloz and 51 Pegasi b
The first unambiguous detection of a planet-mass object orbiting a normal star was by Mayor
and Queloz (1995) of Geneva Observatory. Mayor and Queloz used the ELODIE spectro-
graph, which achieved 13 m/s precision through outstanding mechanical stability. ELODIE (the
successor to CORAVEL) was a fiber-fed spectrograph within a stable, temperature-controlled
environment (Queloz et al. 1998). Wavelength calibration was achieved through use of a
simultaneous observation of a thorium-argon (ThAr) emission lamp. Mayor and Queloz used
cross-correlation with a binary mask to determine the velocity of the stellar spectrum with
respect to the known wavelengths from the emission line spectrum. The mechanical stability
of the instrument ensured that the offset between the stellar and comparison lamp spectra was
fixed and stable, and the scrambling inherent to the fiber ensured that the position of the stellar
spectrum did not suffer significantly from variations in illumination or guiding on the fiber tip.
51 Peg b has a semiamplitude of only 59 m/s and period of only 4.2 d, implying a minimum
mass of 0.5 MJup. This was a shocking development – planet formation theory had not predicted
the existence of such close-in planets,6 and indeed the tiny mass implied by the detection was
smaller than any known binary companion by more than an order of magnitude.7 Immediately,
Marcy and Butler (1995) confirmed the detection, as did Hatzes et al. (1997) soon thereafter.
Debate ensued about the nature of the variations and whether they could be due to nonradial
pulsation modes (Gray 1997), but the detection of planetary transits would put these concerns
to rest: the field of exoplanetary science had begun in earnest. The Geneva team would expand
and find great success over the next decades, eventually pushing their precision below 1 m/s
with the HARPS spectrograph.
4.4 The First Planetary Transit: HD 209458b
The presence of close-in planets provided an opportunity to detect exoplanets directly through
transits. The probability that a planet will transit its hosts star is inversely proportional to its
orbital distance, and since 51 Peg b and similar “Hot Jupiters” orbited at ∼10 stellar radii from
their host stars, their transit probability was around 10%. Photometrists began to monitor these
planets’ hosts stars for such events, expecting to find one once the number of known systems
approached 10. Concerns over nonradial pulsations also contributed to the desire to monitor
stars for photometric evidence of such effects.
Two teams detected the m sin i = .MJup, P = .d planet orbiting HD 209458 indepen-
dently (Mazeh et al. 2000; Henry et al. 2000) and collaborated with photometrists to conduct
6But see the remarkably prescient article by Struve (1952), which all but foresaw this detection, how it would
be made, and the subsequent detection of planetary transits.
7The third firm detection of a substellar object, the imaging of brown dwarf GJ 299 B, was announced at the
same conference as 51 Peg b!

528 10
Exoplanet Detection Methods
the now-standard photometric follow-up prior to publication. Two teams succeeded contem-
poraneously: their announcements of the detection of the transits of HD 209458 appeared in
the literature simultaneously, having been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal within 1 day
of each other (Henry et al. 2000; Charbonneau et al. 2000) exemplifying the intense competition
to produce exoplanetary “firsts.” This measurement of the orbital inclination and radius (and
thus the true mass and density) of the planet dispelled any remaining doubt as to the origins
of most of the similar RV variations of stars and provided the necessary impetus for large-scale
efforts to detect more planets with radial velocities, transits, and, soon, microlensing and direct
imaging.
4.5 Microlensing
4.5.1 Microlensing History
While the idea of gravitational microlensing by individual stars was considered sporadically
over the past century (Einstein 1936; Eddington 1920; Chwolson 1924; Lodge 1919; Liebes
1964; Refsdal 1964), it was the seminal paper by Paczynski (1986) that gave birth to the modern
microlensing field. In this paper, Paczy´nski argued that it would be feasible to monitor several
million stars toward the Magellanic clouds on timescales of a few hours to a few years, in order
to search for gravitational microlensing events due to foreground massive compact objects that
could make up a substantial fraction of the mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way.
Within a few years, several collaborations were initiated to survey regions in the Large Magel-
lenic Clouds and Galactic bulge to search for microlensing events (Alcock et al. 1993; Aubourg
et al. 1993; Udalski et al. 1993). The first detections followed shortly thereafter and to date,
microlensing events of the order have been detected, with the majority seen along the line
of the sight to the bulge.
Although the original motivation for microlensing surveys was the search for dark mat-
ter, it was soon realized that it would be possible to search for planetary companions to the
stars and remnants that provided a guaranteed signal for these experiments. Mao and Paczyn-
ski (1991) first pointed out that binary lenses whose components were separated by roughly
their Einstein ring radius would give to sharp, distinctive light curve features associated with
the presence of caustic curves in such systems. Caustics are the set of source positions where
extra image pairs are created or destroyed with the source crosses the caustic, resulting in large
changes in the total magnification. They also noted that the probability of a source crossing
these caustics for a binary lens remained substantial down to mass ratios of q ∼−there-
fore suggesting that planetary companions could also be detected in this way. Gould and Loeb
(1992)considerthis idea in detail, refining the estimates forthe detection probabilities fordiffer-
ent planet-mass ratios and discussing the practical requirements for carrying out an exoplanet
survey with microlensing. In particular, they advocated a two-tier strategy, whereby survey col-
laborations use a single dedicated telescope equipped with a wide-field camera monitor large
areas of the sky to identify and alert stellar microlensing events before peak, and follow-up
collaborations with access to several longitudinally distributed, narrow-angle telescopes follow
particularly promising events at much higher cadence to search for the brief planetary devia-
tions. The first microlensing planet surveys began in 1995, with the first real-time alerts from

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10

the survey collaborations (e.g., Udalski et al. 1994; Alcock et al. 1996) and subsequent monitor-
ing of these alerts by several follow-up collaborations (Alcock et al. 1996; Albrow et al. 1998;
Rhie et al. 2000).
Ongoing surveys over the next 6 years (1995–2001) failed to detect any planetary microlens-
ing events. The primary reason for this is that the total number of events alerted by the survey
collaborations was relatively low (≲100), and therefore there were typically few events ongo-
ing at any given time that were both suitable for follow-up and very sensitive to planets.
In particular, there were only a handful of high-magnification events per year, which had been
recognized to be intrinsically very sensitive to planetary companions (Griest and Safizadeh
1998). Nevertheless, this phase was important for the field, as the real-world struggles involved
with carrying out and analyzing the results from these surveys, including the ensemble of non-
detections (Gaudi et al. 2002; Snodgrass et al. 2004), naturally led to the development and
maturation of both the theory and practice of the method.
4.5.2 First Planet Detections with Microlensing
The first detections of planets with microlensing were enabled primarily by a series of upgrades
by several survey collaborations to their observational setups. In 2001, the OGLE collaboration
initiated their third phase with an upgrade to a new camera with a 16 times larger field of view.
With this larger field of view, they were able to monitor a larger area of the Galactic bulge with
higher cadence and as a result began alerting ∼500 microlensing events per year. This higher
event rate, combined with improved cooperation between the survey collaborations, led to the
first planet discovery in 2003 by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) and
OGLE collaborations (Bond et al. 2004). Shortly thereafter, the MOA collaboration upgraded
to a 1.8 m telescope with a 2 degcamera (Sako et al. 2008). By 2007, the MOA and OGLE
collaborations were sending alerts for nearly 1,000 microlensing events per year, thus enabling
a substantial increase in the rate of planet detections.
The light curve data and best-fit model for the first microlensing planet discovery are shown
in >Fig. 10-9. This is a “cold Jupiter”: the planet has a mass Mp ∼MJup and orbits a star with
M∗≃.M⊙at a separation of a ∼AU or ∼2.5 times the snow line distance (Bennett et al.
2006).
To date, 14 microlensing planet detections have been published. The masses and semimajor
axes of these planets are shown in >Fig. 10-5; they span nearly three decades in mass from a few
times the mass of the Earth to several times the mass of Jupiter and are spread over a factor of ∼5
in separation, centered at a few times the snow line distance. Notable among these detections
are the first discovery of a “cold Super-Earth” (Beaulieu et al. 2006) and the first discovery of
Jupiter/Saturn analogue (Gaudi et al. 2008; Bennett et al. 2010a).

announced that their long-term astrometric monitoring of the ultracool dwarf star vB 10 had
revealed a ∼6 MJup companion in a 9 month orbit; however, subsequent follow-up with radial
velocities determined that the signal was spurious (Bean et al. 2010a; Anglada-Escudé et al.
2010; Lazorenko et al. 2011).
More promisingly, Muterspaugh et al. (2010) used an optical interferometer to carefully
measure the astrometric motions of binary stars and combined these measurementswith radial
velocities of the systems to search for low-mass companions to stars in tight binaries. The project
concluded with six planetary candidates, including two “high confidence” members that could
prove to be the first astrometrically detected exoplanets. If real, these planets will put strong
constraints on planet formation theories in binary systems.

The astrometric detection of planets discovered by other means has produced substan-
tially more results, primarily because the approximate astrometric signals are known from
prior radial velocity work, and so searches are more efficient. Most fruitful has been work
on nearby stars employing the Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor, which is capa-
ble of precise astrometry of bright stars. This has revealed some high-mass planet candidates
from radial velocity surveys to be binary stars in face-on orbits and has revealed the mutual
inclinations of planets in multiplanet systems (Bean et al. 2007; Bean and Seifahrt 2009;
McArthur et al. 2010).
5.2 Imaging
5.2.1 2M1207b
Chauvin et al. (2010) describe their survey of young, nearby stars for low mass, possibly plan-
etary companions using the ESO/VLT 8 m telescope equipped with the NACO AO system
and infrared camera. They began their survey in 2002 during commissioning and targeted,
among other things, the lowest mass members of known, nearby, young stellar associa-
tions. This allowed them to maximize the separation and contrast of companions and push
coronagraphy into the planetary-mass regime.
After some promising detections of higher-mass objects, the survey bore fruit when Chau-
vin et al. (2004) detected a very low-mass companion to the M8 TW Hydra association (TWA)
brown dwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (called 2M1207; >Fig. 10-10) at a separation of only
⊡Fig. 10-10

dwarf with probable mass ∼5 MJup (From Chauvin et al. (Fig. 11 2004, credit G. Chauvin and ESO))

Exoplanet Detection Methods
0.′′8 (∼55 AU). Membership in the TWA yielded an age for the companion, and a distance was
estimated from the colors and brightness of 2M1207. Comparison with models of the ther-
mal evolution of young objects (Burrows et al. 1997; Chabrier et al. 2000; Baraffe et al. 2002)
allowed Chauvin et al. (2004) to estimate the companions mass to be ∼MJup, assuming that it
was indeed a bound, coeval object and not a background contaminant.
Chauvin et al. (2005) followed up their prior observations to confirm common proper
motion using the same instrument. Theydemonstrated that the twoobjects share propermotion
and parallactic motion with this star, all but proving that they form a bound pair.
The nature of 2M1270b was, and still is, unclear. Its status as a “planetary-mass” object seems
secure, but its wide separation (55 AU) and ∼0.2 mass ratio with its primary made the pair
perhaps more analogous to a scaled-down binary star system than a planet-star system. Chau-
vin et al. (2005) noted that a protoplanetary disk origin for the b component seemed unlikely.
Nonetheless, they had acquired the first image of a planet, by mass if not by formation mech-
anism, and this presaged the many more successes to come from high contrast imaging. The
ESO/VLT group would go on to detect the planet-mass object AB Pic b and many faint stellar
companions to nearby stars, including many planet hosts (Chauvin et al. 2010).
5.2.2 Fomalhaut b
Kalas et al. (2005) used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)
to image the dust belt orbiting Fomalhaut(α Piscis Austrini), a ∼400 Myr-old A4 dwarf at 7.7 pc.
Debris disks or belts are a common feature of many young main-sequence stars, typically with
structure consistent with dynamical interactions from unseen planets (see chapter by Moro-
Martin). The coronagraphic mode of ACS allowed the HST team to make a spectacular and
detailed image of the disk in reflected optical light, revealing that its dominant feature is a
highly inclined, off-center belt with an apparently sharp inner edge at 133 AU radius. The 15 AU
geometric offset of the belt from the star and the sharp inner edge could be explained by the
presence of a planetary companion with nonzero eccentricity “sculpting” the inner edge of the
belt and maintaining the geometric offset via secular perturbation (Wyatt et al. 1999).
Follow-up observations to determine the structure of the disk using a variety of PSF subtrac-
tion techniques allowed Kalas et al. (2008) to confirm a persistentsource with optical brightness
∼25 mag and located ∼13′′ away from the primary star, just inside the belt, and consistent with
the “sculpting” hypothesis. Comparison of multiple epochs allowed Kalas’s team to measure the
orbital motion of the object astrometrically and confirm that it is a proper motion companion
of Fomalhaut.
Puzzlingly, this very faint companion did not appear in their infrared imaging at the Keck
10 m and Gemini 8 m telescopes, which is inconsistent with the optical emission being thermal
in origin according tocurrent models. Kalas et al. were able touse the dust disk itselftoconstrain
the object’s mass dynamically to be <3MJup (Chiang et al. 2009) and thus the lowest mass directly
imaged planet candidate to date. Kalas et al. (2008) proposed several possible explanations for
Fomalhaut b’s unusual optical brightness, such as reflection from a circumplanetary dust ring
that could be as large as 35 planetaryradii, though still significantly smallerthan Saturn’s Phoebe
ring. They also proposed an alternative model where reflected light is due to a transient dust
cloud produced by a rare destructive collision between two analogues of Solar System Kuiper
Belt objects.

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
533
As with 2M1207b, ascertaining the nature of Fomalhaut b will require additional observa-
tions and theoretical input. It orbits an intermediate mass star with semimajor axis ∼120AU and
is still undetected in the infrared. Whateverits nature, its presence in a disk of material strongly
implicates a disk origin for the object and provides hope for more secure similar detections of
similarly bright planetary objects in the future.
5.2.3 β Pictoris b
β Pic is an A star with a prominent, edge-on debris disk that was the first to be imaged in optical
scattered light (Smith and Terrile 1984). One unexpected result was that the disk had several
asymmetries in structure (Kalas and Jewitt 1995), including a vertical warp in the disk midplane
at <100 AU projected radius from the star (Burrows et al. 1995). These and other phenomenon
observed toward β Pic indirectly suggested the existence of a planetary system, and β Pic b was
finally directly imaged using VLT/NACO (Lagrange et al. 2009). As with Fomalhaut, the debris
disk structure could be used to constrain the planet mass through dynamical theory (Mouillet
et al. 1997), as an alternative to mass estimatesbased on planet luminosity models. Its measured
L′ brightness of 11th mag corresponds to a ∼8 MJup planet at age ∼10 Myr.
β Pic b is currently unique among the directly imaged exoplanets for having the small-
est semimajor axis, which, at ∼8 AU, corresponds to the approximate ice line of the system.
Unfortunately, the projected separation is also very small, 0.′′4, and follow-up spectroscopic
study has yet to be obtained. Systems such as Beta Pic are therefore ideal targets for the next
generation of extreme adaptive optics instrumentation discussed below. These future results will
provide important tests of various planet formation and luminosity evolution models, which,
in the 10 Myr-age regime, offer significantly different predictions for the physical properties of
Jupiter-mass planets.
5.2.4 The HR 8799 Planetary System
A US/Canadian team led by Marois used AO coronagraphy on the Keck and Gemini telescopes
in angular differential imaging mode (ADI, Marois et al. 2006), which exploits the rotation of
the field of view on an altitude/azimuth telescope with time to distinguish (and subtract) PSF
features from astrophysical sources. Marois’ team observed the nearby (40 pc) A star HR 8799,
which was known to have an IR excess and to be relatively young (20–160 Myr), making any
orbiting planets likely to be bright in the near infrared. Marois et al. (2008) reported the discov-
ery of three faint companions to HR 8799, with proper motions consistent with HR 8799 and
detectable orbital motion. Comparison with Pleiades brown dwarf brightnesses demonstrated
that these objects had likely masses below 11 MJup. Further observations at Keck Observatory
allowed Marois et al. (2010) to discover a fourth, e component to the system. The projected
orbital separations of the four planets range from 14 to 70 AU.
This family of objects, the first imaged multiplanet system, poses special challenges for
planet formation theory. Marois et al. (2010) argue that their masses and orbital radii (and the
relative scarcity of other systems such as this) are inconsistent with both in situ gravitational
instability disk fragmentation and core-accretion scenarios. Like the close-in “Hot Jupiters,”
these distant planets would seem to implicate migration in a disk as a primary architectural
factor in planetary system formation.

5.2.5 SPHERE, GPI, and Project 1640
Several “extreme” adaptive optics systems with coronagraphs are in development or operation
and will be capable of detecting young (<1 Gyr) giant planets at a few diffraction widths from
the position of a bright star. Such systems employ deformable mirrors with several hundreds
to thousands of actuators and typically observe bright stars in the near infrared. They use inte-
gral field spectrographs that produce data cubes (i.e., a low resolution spectrum at each angular
position) and can exploit field rotation to employ a variety of PSF subtraction and speckle sup-
pression techniques. They thus produce large data volumes, including spectra of their imaged
planets and will typically have narrow fully-corrected fields of view (<′′).
Project 1640 (Hinkley et al. 2011), already in operation, is a collaboration between the
American Museum of Natural History and the University of Cambridge. It employs the PALM
3000 adaptive optics system on the Hale 200 in. telescope at Palomar Observatory. SPHERE
(Beuzit et al. 2006) and GPI (Macintosh et al. 2008) are next-generation coronagraphic imagers
on the VLT and Gemini South telescopes, respectively. Both will employ thousands of actua-
tors and execute campaigns to discover young Jupiter-mass planets orbiting at several AU from
the nearest Sun-like stars. Depending on the adopted planet formation and luminosity evolu-
tion model, the detection rate predicted for GPI ranges between 10% and 25%, given a target
sample with age <100 Myr within 75 pc (McBride et al. 2011). Therefore, if these instruments
observe ∼500 stars from this sample, then there will be at least 50 new exoplanets discovered
and characterized via direct imaging.
5.3 Rocky and Habitable Worlds
5.3.1 HARPS, Keck/HIRES, and the Planet Finding Spectrograph
The first RV-discovered planets had typical Doppler amplitudes of ∼50–500 m/s; the 10 m/s
barrier was breached several times between 2000 and 2005, and detections between 2 and
5 m/s were common between 2005 and 2010. The primary instruments making these detec-
tions were the HIRES instrument on the Keck i telescope (operated by various teams of Marcy
and Butler) with precision as low as 1–3 m/s and the HARPS spectrograph (with its heritage
from the Geneva team) which regularly achieves precision below 1 m/s on bright stars. Several
next-generation planet finding spectrographs are being built or commissioned at this writing,
including the Planet Finding Spectrograph at Magellan, HARPS-North, and ESPRESSO.
There are two primary obstacles to further precision in radial velocity surveys toward the
10 cm/s necessary for the detection of true Earth analogues. The first is an instrumental stabil-
ity issue: calibrating the wavelength solution of spectrographs to an order of magnitude better
precision than previously possible. For emission-lamp calibration, a fundamental limit is the
lifetime and stability of the thorium-argon lamps used as wavelength fiducial. A promising solu-
tion is the use of laser frequency combs, which provide essentially arbitrary levels of wavelength
precision. Such devices will be used in HARPS-North and ESPRESSO. Also of importance is
understanding and maximizing the consistency of the illumination of the output fibers used to
guide light to the spectrograph.
For absorption-cell instruments, the practical limit is one’s ability to model the system, in
particular, the absorption cell, the slit illumination function, the instrumental profile, and the
star itself. Progress here is primarily made through careful FTS scans of the actual cell used

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
535
at the telescope, improved modeling techniques that account for scattered light, and better
deconvolution techniques for acquiring stellar templates.
The second obstacle is that of the fundamental stability of the stars themselves. Stars expe-
rience p-mode oscillations at the few m/s level that must be either modeled or averaged
over. Stellar magnetic surface activity also contributes to radial velocity signatures in many
ways, most importantly through rotationally modulated spots and plage, and perhaps through
long-term stellar cycles. Modeling and mitigating these effects, perhaps though careful use of
contemporaneous photometry, will be necessary to achieve the next large improvement in RV
precision for the next generation of planet searches.
5.3.2 Space-Based Transit Surveys
Transit surveys for rocky planets around solar-type stars require extremely precise relative pho-
tometry. The fractional depth of the transit of an Earth-sized planet passing in front of a solar
radius star is only δ ∼× −. While relative photometry at a few times this level has been
achieved from the ground for individual bright stars with specialized techniques (e.g., Johnson
et al. 2009; Southworth et al. 2009; Colón et al. 2010), obtaining ≲−relative photometry for
the large ensembles of stars required to detect numerous transiting systems is probably out of
reach for ground-based surveys, due to unavoidable systematics arising from variations due
to the Earth’s atmosphere. The stability afforded by space-based surveys, on the other hand,
enables relative photometry for large numbers of stars that is limited primarily by photon and
astrophysical noise. Furthermore, for space-based surveys, it is possible to obtain continuous
photometry for very long periods of time, without diurnal or weather interruptions. This elim-
inates the aliasing problems that are germane to single-site ground-based transit surveys and
enables the detection of long-period transiting systems, which, due to the low duty cycles and
long transit durations, are extremely difficult to detect from the ground.
CoRoT is a CNES-led space mission with participation from ESA and other international
partners, with the primary goals of studying stars via asteroseismology and detecting transiting
planets (Baglin 2003). The 27 cm telescope was launched in December 2006 and is located in
a low Earth orbit. CoRoT is equipped with a 3.05○by 2.7○camera that primarily monitors
fields in two different areas of the sky, located toward Galactic longitudes of ∼○and ∼○
(Auvergne et al. 2009). There are two dwell times for the fields; long fields are typically observed
for ∼150 days, whereas short fields are observed for ∼30 days. To date, more than 130,000 stars in
∼20 fields have been monitored with a cadence of .min (Michel and Baglin 2012). The stellar
populations of these fields vary dramatically, but anywhere from 40% to 60% of the targets are
expected to be dwarf stars suitable for transit surveys (Cabrera et al. 2009; Erikson et al. 2012).
Over the typical R ∼−magnitude range of the targets, CoRoT achieves relative photometry
on time scales of ∼2 h at the level of ∼−at the bright end, degrading to ∼−at R ∼
(Aigrain et al. 2009). The precision and cadence is sufficient to detect Jupiter-sized companions
over the entire magnitude range, whereas Neptunes and Super-Earths can be detected around
the brighter stars (e.g., Cabrera et al. 2009).
To date, CoRoT has announced over 20 detections of transiting planets and brown dwarfs.
Notable among these discoveries are the detection of a transiting brown dwarf with a mass of
∼60 MJup (Bouchy et al. 2011), the detection of a Jupiter-sized planet with a relatively long period
of ∼95 days (Deeg et al. 2010), and the first detection of a transiting Super-Earth, with a radius
of ∼1.7 R⊕and a mass of −M⊕(Léger et al. 2009).

Exoplanet Detection Methods
Kepler is a NASA mission launched in March of 2009, with the primary goal of measuring
the frequency of rocky planets in the Habitable Zones of sun-like stars (Borucki et al. 2010).
To accomplish this, the 0.95 m Kepler telescope situated in an Earth-trailing orbit is monitoring
a 105 degfield of view near the constellation Cygnus continuously over the 7+ year lifetime
of the mission. Light curves of ∼200,000 stars have been obtained over the course of the mis-
sion, with typical sampling cadences of ∼30 min, amounting to ∼24,000 observations over the
first ∼500 days of the mission for the subset of stars monitored continuously during this time
(Batalha et al. 2012). A subset of stars have higher cadences of ∼1 min. The majority of the target
stars are solar-type dwarfs with Teff ∼,−,K and log g ∼., but the full range of target
properties span Teff ≃,−,K and log g ≃−(Batalha et al. 2012). The photometric
precision and intrinsic stellar variability of this sample is discussed in Gilliland et al. (2011).
Relevant to the primary mission goal, the photometric variability for V ≲stars on transit
time scales is ∼× −, quite an impressive figure, but ∼50% larger than originally anticipated,
primarily due to the fact that typical target stars turn out to be a factor of ∼2 times more vari-
able than the Sun, probably due to their relative youth. Although this increased noise reduces
the expected sensitivity and so yield of the mission for habitable Earthlike planets, this reduced
sensitivity was offset with a mission extension (Gilliland et al. 2011).
Although the data set is not yet sufficient to reliably detect true Earth analogues, the
exquisite photometric precision and large sample size have already enabled an fantastic array of
science. In particular, based on the first ∼500 days of data, a total of ∼2,300 transiting planet can-
didateshave been identified (Batalha et al. 2012), including ∼360 multiplanet systems (Fabrycky
et al. 2012). The majority of these candidates are smaller than Neptune. Despite the fact that
a small fraction of these signals have been confirmed by either radial velocity or transiting
timing methods, the overwhelming majority of these signals are expected to be due to real plan-
ets, from a number of lines of evidence (e.g., Morton and Johnson 2011; Lissauer et al. 2012).
Over 30 systems have been confirmed from various methods, including a system with six tran-
siting planets (Lissauer et al. 2011), the first discovery of a circumbinary planet (Doyle et al.
2011), and several planets with radius of ≲R⊕(Muirhead et al. 2012; Fressin et al. 2012).
The masses and semimajor axes of the confirmed CoRoT and Kepler systems with mass
measurements as of Dec. 2011 are shown in >Fig. 10-5. Comparing these to the planets dis-
covered by ground-based transit surveys highlights the large expansion of discovery space that
is enabled by going to space.
5.3.3 Second-Generation Microlensing Surveys
Microlensing exoplanet searches are currently in the midst of a transition to the second genera-
tion of surveys that will enable the routine detection of rocky planets. Although there have been
substantial modifications and upgrades to the details of the “two-tier” survey strategy initially
suggested by Gould and Loeb (1992), up until very recently, this basic approach has been in
use. Second-generation surveys will operate in a very different manner. With the development
of very large format CCD cameras with fields of view of a square degree or greater, it becomes
possible to monitor tens of square degrees of the Galactic bulge containing roughly 100 million
stars with cadences of tens of minutes. These cadences are sufficient to detect both the primary
event and detect the perturbations from low-mass (∼M⊕) planets therefore obviating the need
for a follow-up observations and allowing for more uniform data and a more objective detec-
tion criteria. In order to detect all the planetary perturbations, including those that last less than

Exoplanet Detection Methods 10
537
a day, a longitudinally distributed network of 1–2 m class telescopes equipped with such wide
FOV cameras is required.
The transition to the next-generation survey model began in 2006 when MOA upgraded to
the dedicated MOA-II telescope in New Zealand, which has a diameter of 1.8 m and 2.2 deg
FOV (Sako et al. 2008; Hearnshaw et al. 2006). In 2010, OGLE upgraded to the 1.4 degOGLE-
IV camera on their dedicated 1.3 m telescope in Chile (Udalski 2009). The Wise Observatory’s
1.0 m telescope in Israel has recently been equipped with a 1 degcamera (Gorbikov et al. 2010).
These three groups are collaborating to continuously monitor an ∼8 degregion of the bulge
with cadences of 15–30 min (Shvartzvald and Maoz 2012), and the first planet detection with
this strategy was recently announced (Yee et al. 2012).
The next milestone in the development of second-generation microlensing surveys will be
the completion ofthe Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). KMTNet is an ambi-
tious, fully funded plan by the Korean government to build three identical 1.6 m telescopes
with 4 degFOV cameras. These will be located in South America, South Africa, and Australia.
First light for the final telescope is scheduled for late 2014.
These second generation surveys are expected to increase the planet yields by roughly an
order of magnitude over current surveys (Bennett 2004; Shvartzvald and Maoz 2012) and enable
the detection of Earth-mass planets as well as free-floating planets with masses greater than
∼10 M⊕.

Conclusions
In the roughly two decades since the first detections of planets outside the Solar System, the
field of exoplanets has grown enormously, developing into one of the forefront research areas
in astronomy. The count of confirmed planets is now over 700, with the sample doubling in size
every few years at the current rate. New techniques, methods, experiments, instruments, tele-
scopes, and satellites to detect exoplanets are continually being developed and are enabling the
detection and characterization of an increasingly broad diversity of planets orbiting a wider and
widerrange ofhosts. These efforts are not onlyconstantly uncovering new and unexpected types
of planetary systems but are beginning to allow for the robust statistical characterization of the
demographics of large samples of exoplanets spanning a wide range of parameter space. These
efforts ultimately serve to allow us achieve the more general goals of placing our Solar System
in the context of planetary systems through the Galaxy, understanding the physics of planetary
formation and evolution, and determining the frequency of habitable and inhabited worlds.
