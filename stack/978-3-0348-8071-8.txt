Preface 
This book contains an expanded version of the lectures delivered by the au-
thors at the Euro Summer School Symplectic Geometry of Integrable Hamiltonian 
Systems. The summer school took place at the Centre de Recerca Matematica 
(Barcelona) from the 10th to the 15th of July 2001. It consisted of three main 
courses of 7.5 hours each and of some complementary talks dealing with integrable 
Hamiltonian systems. 
Thus the book has three parts. The first part by Michele Audin is devoted 
to special Lagrangian submanifolds, the second part by Ana Cannas da Silva deals 
with symplectic toric manifolds, and the last part by Eugene Lerman centers on 
contact toric manifolds. Hamiltonian systems arose, as their name suggests, from 
the formulation (by Hamilton) of classical mechanics: a Hamiltonian system is a 
dynamical system that describes the motion of a mechanical system whose total 
energy is conserved. This is where symplectic geometry comes from. It has since 
developed into an area of mathematics in its own right, but it remains a point 
of contact between physics and geometry. Among all the Hamiltonian systems, 
the integrable ones 
those which have many conserved quantities - have special 
geometric properties; in particular, their solutions are very regular and quasi-
periodic. Moreover, their study has been central in symplectic geometry, as it 
stands at a crossroads between dynamical systems, algebraic geometry, and group 
representation theory (to name a few areas of mathematics involved). 
The quasi-periodicity of the solutions of an integrable system is a result of the 
fact that the system is invariant under a (semi-global) torus action. It is thus nat-
ural to investigate the symplectic manifolds that can be endowed with a (global) 
torus action. This leads, in a natural way, to symplectic toric manifolds (part B 
of this book), which are examples of extremely symmetric Hamiltonian systems. 
Physics makes a surprising come-back in part A: to describe Mirror Symmetry, one 
looks for a special kind of Lagrangian submanifolds and integrable systems, the 
special Lagrangians. Furthermore, integrable Hamiltonian systems on punctured 
cotangent bundles are a starting point for the study of contact toric manifolds 
(part C of this book). Along the way, tools from many different areas of mathe-
matics are brought to bear on the questions at hand. Thus actions of Lie groups 
in symplectic and contact manifolds, the Delzant theorem, Morse theory, sheaves 
and Cech cohomology, and aspects of Calabi-Yau manifolds make an appearance 
in this book. 
We hope that this book can serve as an introduction to symplectic and con-
tact geometry for graduate students and that it can also be useful to research 
mathematicians interested in integrable systems.

Part A 
Lagrangian Submanifolds 
Michele Audin 

Introduction 
This text is an introduction to Lagrangian and special Lagrangian submanifolds. 
Special Lagrangian submanifolds were invented twenty years ago by Harvey and 
Lawson [18]. They have become very fashionable recently, after the work of 
McLean [25], leading to the beautiful speculations of Strominger, Yau and Zas-
low [32] and the remarkable papers of Hitchin [19, 20] and Donaldson [11]. 
My aim here is mainly to present as many examples as possible. I have taken 
some time to explain why we know so many Lagrangian and so few special La-
grangian submanifolds and immersions. There are mainly two reasons: 
• To be Lagrangian is, eventually, a linear property. On the other hand, the 
property to be special Lagrangian is, in dimension 3 and more, non linear . 
• The moduli space of Lagrangian sub manifolds that are close to a given one 
is an infinite dimensional manifold, while the corresponding moduli space of 
special Lagrangian sub manifolds is finite dimensional. 
This will be apparent in the number and nature of the examples I describe in these 
notes. 
To prepare these lectures, in addition to the papers mentioned above, I have 
used standard textbooks on manifolds and vector fields as [22], on symplectic 
geometry as [4, 7, 24, 30] and on complex manifolds and Hodge theory as [8, 15]. 
I have used standard notation but, although this text pretends to be written 
in English, I have kept a preference for (transparent) French standards, for instance 
pn (K) for the projective space of dimension n over the field K and t A for the 
transpose of a matrix A. 
I thank Etienne Mann, Edith Socie, Thomas Vogel and Jean-Yves Welschin-
ger for their comments and their help during the preparation of these notes. Special 
thanks to Mihai Damian, Alicia Jurado and Sebastien Racaniere. 

Chapter I 
Lagrangian and special 
Lagrangian immersions in en 
In this chapter, I define Lagrangian and special Lagrangian immersions in en. To 
begin with, I explain that en is the standard real vector space endowed with a 
non degenerate alternated bilinear form (§ 1.1) and use this "symplectic structure" 
to define Lagrangian subspaces and immersions (§§ 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4). Later, I use 
the complex structure as well, to define special Lagrangian immersions (§ 1.5). 
1.1 
Symplectic form on en, symplectic vector spaces 
I.1.a 
Symplectic vector spaces 
Consider the vector space en with the Hermitian form 
n 
(Z, Z') = L ZjZj 
j=1 
(note that it is anti-linear in the first entry and linear in the second). Decompose 
it in real and imaginary parts: 
(Z, Z') = (Z, Z') - iw(Z, Z'). 
The real part is the standard scalar product (Euclidean structure) of en = Rn x 
Rn, 
n 
(Z, Z') = L(XjXj + YjYj) = x· X' + Y· Y', 
j=1 

6 
In en 
a symmetric non degenerate (real) bilinear form. The imaginary part defines a 
(real) bilinear form 
n 
W = L(XjYj - XjYJ) = X'· Y - X· y' 
j=l 
that is alternated, this meaning that w(Z, Z) = 0 for all Z. Equivalently, w is 
skew-symmetric, that is, 
w(Z', Z) = -w(Z, Z'). 
To write these formulas, I have decomposed the complex vectors of en as 
Z = X +iY, 
and I have used the scalar product X· Y of Rn. The form w is non degenerate 
too, as 
w(X, Y) = 0 for all Y =} X = O. 
More generally, on a real vector space E, a symplectic form is a non degen-
erate alternated bilinear form. A vector space endowed with a symplectic form is 
said to be a symplectic vector space. 
I.1.b 
Symplectic bases 
Fix a complex unitary basis (e1,"" en) of en. Put ij = -iej, so that 
is a basis of the real vector space en. Compute w on the vectors of this basis: 
w(ei, ej) = Im(e;, ej) = Imbi,j = 0, 
also 
w(j;, ij) = Im(iei' iej) = Im(ei' ej) = 0 
and eventually 
w(ei,ij) = Im(ei,-iej) = Re(ei,ej) =i5'j' 
Inspired by these properties, we say that a basis (e1,"" en, iI, ... , in) of a 
symplectic vector space is a symplectic basis if 
w(ei' ij) = bi,J and w(ei' ej) = w(J;, ij) = 0 for all i and j. 
There are symplectic bases in all symplectic spaces, thanks to the following propo-
sition. 

Ii. Symplectic form on en, symplectic vector spaces 
7 
Proposition 1.1.1. Let w be a symplectic form on a finite dimensional vector space 
E. There exists a basis (e1,"" en, h,···, fn) of E such that w(ei' fJ) = bi,j and 
w(ei,ej) = w(f;,fJ) = O. 
Proof. As w is non degenerate, it is not identically zero so that one can find two 
vectors e1 and h such that w( e1, h) = 1. One then checks that the restriction 
of w to the orthogonal complement (with respect to w) of the plane (e1' h) is 
non degenerate. One eventually concludes by induction on the dimension -
once 
noticed that an alternated bilinear form on a I-dimensional vector space is zero. 
0 
In particular, the dimension of E is an even number and this is the only 
invariant of the isomorphism type of (E,w). If E has dimension 2n, then E with 
its symplectic form is isomorphic to en with the form w. This result can be 
called a "linear Darboux theorem", in reference with the forthcoming (Darboux) 
theorem 11.3.6. 
More generally, an alternated bilinear form has a rank, that is the dimension 
of the largest subspace on which it is non degenerate, and is an even number. 
Matrices 
In a symplectic basis, the matrix of the symplectic form is 
( Old) 
J = 
-Id 0 
. 
Notice that the matrix J satisfies 
J2 = - Id. 
As the matrix of an endomorphism, this is a complex structure. In the symplectic 
basis of en associated with the canonical (complex) basis (e1' ... , en), J is nothing 
other that the matrix of multiplication by i. 
I.I.c The symplectic form as a differential form 
One can write w as a differential form 
n 
W = LdYj I\dx). 
)=1 
This is an exact differential form (the differential of a degree I-form): 
n 
w = d(LyjdXj) = d(Y· X). 
j=l 
The form ,\ = Y . dX is called Liouville form (see § ILl below). 

8 
In en 
I.1.d The symplectic group 
This is the group of isometries of w. A transformation g of en is symplectic if it 
satisfies 
w(gZ, gZ') = w(Z, Z') for all Z, Z' E en. 
Call Sp(2n) the symplectic group of the space en of dimension 2n. Consider 
all the groups O(2n), GL(n; C), U(n) and Sp(2n) as subgroups of GL(2n; R). 
Proposition 1.1.2. The following equalities hold 
Sp(2n) n O(2n) = Sp(2n) n GL(n; C) = O(2n) n GL(n; C) = U(n). 
Proof. Let us characterize our subgroups of GL(2n; R): 
(1) g E GL(n; C) if and only if g is e-linear, that is, if and only if 
g( iZ) = ig( Z) for all Z. 
For a matrix A, this is to say that AJ = J A. 
(2) g E Sp(2n) if and only if g preserves w, that is, if and only if w(gZ,gZ') = 
w(Z, Z') for all Z and Z'. For a matrix A, this is 
tAJA = 1. 
(3) g E O(2n) if and only if (gZ, gZ') = (Z, Z'). For a matrix A, this is t AA = Id. 
One then checks that two of these conditions imply the third: 
• (2) and (3) imply that 
(gZ, gZ') = (Z, Z') 
thus that g E U(n) C GL(n; e). 
• (3) and (1) imply that 
w(gZ,gZ') =w(gZ,-ig(iZ')) = (gZ,g(iZ')) = (Z,iZ') =w(Z,Z') 
thus that g E Sp(2n). 
• in the same way, (1) and (2) imply (3). 
In matrix terms, the intersection Sp(2n) n O(2n) is the set of matrices 
(u -V) 
VUE GL(n; e) c GL(2n; R) 
such that 
{ tuv = tvu 
tuu + tvv = Id. 
This is exactly the condition that U + iV be a unitary matrix. 
o 

I. 2. Lagrangian subspaces 
9 
I.I.e 
Orthogonality, isotropy 
Write FJ. for the Euclidean orthogonal of the real subspace F of en and FO for 
its symplectic (that is, with respect to w) orthogonal. As w is non degenerate, one 
has 
and 
dimF + dimFo = 2n = dimR en. 
Notice however that a subspace and its orthogonal may have a non trivial inter-
section. The restriction of the non degenerate form w to a subspace is not always 
a non degenerate form, in contradiction with what happens in the Euclidean case 
(which is due to the positivity of the scalar product). In other words, all the sub-
spaces of a symplectic space do not have the same behaviour with respect to the 
symplectic form. See Exercises 1.6 and 1. 7. 
One says that a subspace F is isotropic if F C FO, co-isotropic if F :) FO. 
For instance, a (real) line is always isotropic, as it lies in its orthogonal which is 
a (real, co-isotropic) hyperplane. Notice that F is isotropic if and only if FO is 
co-isotropic. Notice also that the dimension of an isotropic subspace is at most 
equal to n, half the dimension of en. 
1.2 
Lagrangian subspaces 
I.2.a Definition of Lagrangian subspaces 
The isotropic subspaces of maximal dimension n are Lagrangian. For instance, 
Rn c en is a Lagrangian subspace. More generally, a subspace generated by "one 
half" of a symplectic basis is Lagrangian. Conversely, if F is an isotropic subspace 
of dimension k ::; n, it is possible to complete any basis (el,'" ,ek) of F m a 
symplectic basis and thus to obtain Lagrangian subs paces containing F. 
Let us use now the complex multiplication in en to state: 
Lemma I.2.1. A real subspace P of en is Lagrangian if and only if pJ. = iP. 
Proof. This is a straightforward computation: 
w(Z, Z') = 0 {o} Im(Z, Z') = 0 
{o} Re(Z, iZ') = 0 
{o} (Z, iZ') = o. 
D 
Lemma 1.2.2. Let P be a Lagrangian subspace of en and let (Xl, ... ,xn ) be an 
orthonormal basis of this real subspace. Then (Xl, ... ,xn ) is a complex unitary 
basis of en. Conversely, if (Xl, ... , Xn) is a unitary basis of en, the real subspace 
it spans is Lagrangian. 

10 
In en 
Proof. If (Xl, ... , Xn) is an orthonormal basis of the Lagrangian P, the previous 
lemma says that the basis (Xl, ... ,Xn , iXI, ... ,ixn ) is an orthonormal basis of the 
real space en, thus that (Xl, ... ,xn) is a complex basis of en. Moreover, one has 
thus this is a unitary basis. The converse is even more obvious. 
o 
I.2.h 
The symplectic reduction 
This is a simple but useful operation, essentially contained in the next lemma. 
Lemma 1.2.3. Let P be a Lagrangian subspace and F be a co-isotropic subspace of 
en, such that 
P+F = en. 
Then the restriction of the projection 
P n F c F -------+ F / FO 
is injective, the space F / FO is symplectic and the image of P n F is a Lagrangian 
subspace. 
Proof. The symplectic form of en clearly induces a non degenerate form on F / FO, 
as FO is the kernel of the restriction of w to F. The kernel of the composition 
P n Fe F -------+ F/ FO 
is 
P n F n FO = P n FO 
F being co-isotropic, F::) FO 
= (PO + F)O, since (A + B)O = AO n BO, 
= (P + F) ° as P is Lagrangian, P = po 
= (en)O 
because P + F = en 
= 0 
as w is non degenerate. 
The map is thus injective. Eventually P n F is isotropic and has dimension

1.3. The Lagrangian Grassmannian

1.3 
The Lagrangian Grassmannian 
We consider now the set An of all Lagrangian subspaces of en. 
I.3.a The Grassmannian An as a homogeneous space 
Look again at lemma 1.2.2. If PI and P2 are two Lagrangian subspaces of en, 
choose an orthonormal basis for each. We thus have two unitary bases of en. 
There exists a unitary transformation (an element of the unitary group U(n)) that 
maps the basis of PIon that of P2 ... and thus a fortiori the Lagrangian PIon the 
Lagrangian P2 . 
In other words, the group U(n) acts transitively on the set of Lagrangian 
subspaces of en. The stabilizer of the Lagrangian Rn is the group O(n) of or-
thonormal basis changes in R n. We have defined this way a bijection 
U(n)/O(n) --+ An 
with the help of which we identify the two sets. Notice that this provides An with 
a topology, namely that of U(n)/ O(n), the quotient topology of the topology of 
the matrix group U(n). 
Example 1.3.1. As all lines are isotropic, the space Al is the space of real lines in 
e = R2, namely the projective space pl(R). The unitary group U(l) is a circle 
and the orthogonal group 0(1) is the group with two elements {±l}. 
As the unitary group U (n) is compact (being closed and bounded in the 
space of matrices) and path-connected (exercise), the space An is a compact path-
connected topological space. 
I.3.b The manifold An 
Let us firstly describe a neighbourhood of P E An in An. Put 
Up = {Q E An I Q n (iP) = O} . 
This is an open subset: using a unitary matrix, one can assume that P = Rn, but 
then URn is the image in An of the (saturated) open subset of U(n) consisting of 
all the unitary bases the real parts of whose vectors form a basis of R n. This is, 
clearly, a neighbourhood of P. 
Lemma 1.3.2. The open set Up is homeomorphic to the real vector space of all 
symmetric endomorphisms of P. 
Proof. The subspaces Q that intersect iP only at 0 are the graphs of the linear 
maps rp : P ---t iP. It is more convenient to call irp the linear map, so that rp is a 
linear map from P to itself. Write now that Q is Lagrangian, namely that 
'</x,yEP, 
w(x+irp(x),y+irp(y)) =0. 

12 
In en 
We have 
w(x + iip(x), Y + iip(Y)) = - Im(x + iip(x), Y + iip(Y)) 
= w(x, y) + w(ip(x), ip(Y)) + (ip(x), y) - (x, ip(Y)) 
= (ip(x),y) - (x,ip(Y)), 
P being Lagrangian. The subspace Q is Lagrangian if and only if the last expression 
vanishes for all x and Y in P, namely if and only if ip is symmetric1 . We have thus 
defined a bijection that maps 0 to P 
EndSym(P) ----+ Up 
ip f-----+ graph of iip 
and is clearly a homeomorphism. 
D 
Remark 1.3.3. Consider for instance the "vertical" Lagrangian iRn C en. We see 
that An is a disjoint union 
An = A~ u ~n 
where ~n is the set of all Lagrangians that are not transversal to iRn and A~ is 
identified with the space of n x n real symmetric matrices. 
We intend to prove now that the open sets Up define the structure of a 
manifold on An. Notice firstly that any n-dimensional subspace Q of Rn x R n 
may be represented by a rank-n matrix 
Z = (~) , with 2n lines and n columns, 
the column vectors of which form a basis of Q. Two matrices Z and Z' describe the 
same subspace if and only if there exists an n x n invertible matrix g E GL(n; R), 
such that Zg = Z'. 
Lemma 1.3.4. The subspace Q is Lagrangian if and only if the two matrices X and 
Yare such that 
Proof. Let u, u' ERn and let z, z' be the corresponding vectors in Q: 
z = (~) u, 
z' = (~) u'. 
Note that Xu, Yu, Xu' and Yu' are vectors of Rn. We compute: 
w(z, z') = w((Xu, Yu), (Xu', Yu')) 
= (Xu) . (Yu') - (Yu) . (Xu') (scalar product in Rn) 
= tutXYu' - tutyXu' (as U· V = tUV) 
= tu CXY - tyX) u'.

I.3. The Lagrangian Grassmannian 
13 
Remark I.3.5. If Q is the graph of a linear map Rn ---+ iRn, it can be represented 
by a matrix Z = (~). The relation in lemma I.3.4 simply expresses the fact that 
the matrix A is symmetric. 
Consider more generally a subset J of {I, ... , n} and the Lagrangian subspace 
PJ of Rn x Rn spanned by {( ej )jEJ, (iej )j\lJ}. Denote U PJ by U,J (for simplicity). 
Any element of U J is described by a unique matrix Z such that, if we extract from 
Z the matrix containing the lines j (for j E J) and j + n (for j tf. J), we get the 
identity matrix. The 2n open sets UJ clearly cover An. Moreover, as we have said 
it, each of them can be identified with the subspace Sym(n; R) of n x n symmetric 
matrices. The UJ's, with their identification with Sym(n; R) are coordinate charts. 
Change of coordinates are given by

where Z,J(A) is the matrix obtained from (~) by mapping the first n lines on 
the lines j (for j E J) and j + n (for j tf. J). The matrix Zp(B) is obtained by 
multiplying ZJ(A) by the inverse matrix of the (invertible!) matrix of the lines 
corresponding to J' in ZJ(A). The coordinate change A f---7 B is clearly smooth (it 
is actually rational, thus analytic). 
Proposition 1.3.6. The Gmssmannian An is a compact and connected manifold of

I.3.c 
The tautological vector bundle 
Consider the space 
En = {(P, x) E An X en I x E P} . 
Together with its projection on An, this is a rank-n vector bundle over An. The 
fiber of En at P E An is the Lagrangian subspace P itself, a reason why this 
bundle is qualified as "tautological". 
The property expressed in Lemma I.2.1, namely p.l = iP, is translated, in 
terms of the bundle En, in the fact that En @R e, the complexified bundle, is trivial 
(has a canonical trivialization). The (global) trivialization is the isomorphism of 
complex vector bundles 
En @R e ---+ An X en 
(P, x @ (a + ib)) ~ 
(P, (a + ib)x). 

14 
In en 
I.3.d The tangent bundle to An 
The canonical identification of the open subset Up with the space of symmetric 
endomorphisms of P allows to identify the tangent bundle of An with the bundle 
EndSym(En). It is also possible to describe this bundle from the tangent bundle 
of U(n). The group U(n) is described as a submanifold of the space of all complex 
matrices by the equation t AA = Id, so that we have 
TA U(n) = {X E GL(n; C) I tAx + tXA = o}. 
Call u(n) the vector space TId U(n) of skew-Hermitian matrices. There is an iso-
morphism 
TA U(n) --+ u(n) 
X f----t tAx 
identifying the tangent bundle TU(n) with the trivial bundle U(n) x u(n) -
as 
any Lie group, U (n) is parallelizable. Consider the Lagrangian R n, image in An 
of the identity matrix Id. One can write 
TRn(U(n)/O(n)) = u(n)/o(n), 
this is the quotient of the vector space of anti-Hermitian matrices by that of skew-
symmetric real matrices. We thus identify 
TRnAn = i Sym(n; R), 
as the real part of a skew-Hermitian matrix is skew-symmetric and its imaginary 
part is symmetric. 
Let P be any Lagrangian subspace. Choose a unitary matrix A such that 
P = A . Rn. As we have identified the quotient u(n)/o(n) with the subspace 
i Sym(n; R) of u(n), we identify the quotient T[AJAn with a subspace of TA U(n): 
i Symr R: -X-r--;-A-· -X-.' TT" 
u(n) 
) TA U(n). 
We derive an isomorphism 
i Sym(n; R) --+ TpAn 
X 
f----t A . X. 
Remark 1.3.7. This isomorphism depends on the choice of A, this is why it does 
not follow that An is parallelizable (it is actually not, as soon as n ~ 2). 

I.3. The Lagrangian Grassmannian 
15 
1.3.e 
The case of oriented Lagrangian subspaces 
One can also consider the space An of oriented Lagrangian subspaces. Replacing 
"orthonormal basis" by "positive orthonormal basis" in what precedes, we get an 
identification of An with U (n) j SO (n). 
1.3.f The determinant and the Maslov class 
The "determinant" mapping 
det : U(n) -------+ S1 
descends to the quotient by SO(n) and, in the same way, its square 
2 
1 
det : U (n) -------+ S 
to th~ quotient by O(n). This allows to compute the fundamental groups of An 
and An. 
Proposition 1.3.8. The fundamental group of An (resp. An) is isomorphic to Z. 
The covering An ---7 An shows 71"1 (An) as an index-2 subgroup in 71"1(An). 
Proof. Recall first that the group SU(n) is simply connected. This can be proved 
by induction on n: SU(l) is a point and SU(n + 1) acts transitively on the unit 
sphere s2n+1 of C n +1 with stabilizer SU(n), so that the exact sequence 
71"1 SU(n) -------+ 71"1 SU(n + 1) -------+ 71"1s2n+1 
gives the result. As the determinant mapping 
det: U(n) -------+ S1 
is a fibration with fiber SU(n), it induces an isomorphism 
det*: 71"1 U(n) -------+ 71"1 (S1). 
The fiber of the determinant mapping An -------+ S1 is SU(n)j SO(n), which is 
simply connected, thus 
det* : 71"1An -------+ 71"IS1 
is an isomorphism. What is left to prove is a consequence of the fact that the 
diagram 
is commutative.

In en 
"The" generator of KlAn is called the Maslov class. One also calls "Maslov 
class" the cohomology class 
that it defines by duality. Using the notation of Remark 1.3.3, it can be shown that 
J-l is the dual class to the integral homology class represented by ~n (see [1, 12]). 
1.4 
Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
We are going now to globalize the notion of Lagrangian subspace, considering 
sub manifolds of en whose tangent space at any point is Lagrangian. We will not 
really need actual submanifolds, but maps 
f : V -------+ en 
from some n-dimensional manifold to en, the tangent mapping of which 
is an injection for any point x of V, with image a Lagrangian subspace. It is then 
said that f is a Lagrangian immersion. 
For instance, any immersion of a curve (real manifold of dimension 1) in e is 
a Lagrangian immersion. Any product of Lagrangian immersions is a Lagrangian 
immersion (into the product target space), we thus obtain Lagrangian immersions 
of tori (products of circles). Our next aim is to describe examples of Lagrangian 
submanifolds and immersions in en and to give a necessary (and sufficient) con-
dition for a given manifold to have a Lagrangian immersion into en. 
I.4.a 
Lagrangian submanifolds described by functions 
We consider firstly graphs. 
Proposition 104.1. The graph of a map F : R n -+ (i)Rn is a Lagrangian submani-
fold if and only if F is the gradient of a function f : Rn -+ R. 
Proof. The tangent space to the graph at the point (x, F (x)) is the graph of (dF) x, 
the differential of F at the point x. This graph is a Lagrangian subspace if and 
only if (dF)x is a symmetric endomorphism (see the proof of Lemma 1.3.2). The 
matrix of;! oXj is symmetric for all x if and only if the differential form ~ Fidxi 
over Rn is closed or, equivalently, exact: 
of 
Fi = -:::;-, namely F = V' j.

I.4. Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
17 
See, more generally, Proposition II.2.1. 
The Lagrangian submanifolds obtained as graphs have a very specific prop-
erty: the projection of the Lagrangian sub manifold on Rn is a diffeomorphism. 
We would like to consider more general Lagrangian immersions, for instance im-
mersions of compact manifolds. Here is a way to construct Lagrangian immersions 
using the reduction process of § 1.2.b. We start from a Lagrangian submanifold2 
L c Cn+k • We want to construct a Lagrangian immersion into en. To write en 
as F / FO, we choose the co-isotropic subspace F = en E9 R k, the orthogonal of 
which is FO = 0 E9 R k. We suppose that the sub manifold L is "transversal to F" 
in the sense that, for all x, 
Tx L + F = C nH . 
The Lagrangian subspace TxL thus satisfies the assumption of the reduction lemma 
(Lemma 1.2.3). Hence the composition 
r~T;n P l 
P --+ Plpo = en 
-..L-
-
-
-
I 
is the injection of a Lagrangian subspace. 
Consider now the intersection V of the submanifold L with F. With the 
transversality assumption we have made on L, V is an n-dimensional submanifold 
of F (a consequence of the inverse function theorem) whose tangent space Tx V is 
the intersection of TxL with F. Thus, the reduction lemma asserts, at the level 
of each tangent space, that, for all x in V = L n F, we have the injection of a 
Lagrangian subspace 
In other words, the composition 
V = L n F c F --+ F / FO = en 
is a Lagrangian immersion. 
Remark 1.4.2. Even if one starts from a Lagrangian submanifold, what we get in 
general is only an immersion. 
Generating functions 
We generalize the "graph" construction, using the reduction process as explained. 
Let us start with a nice and useful example. 
Example 1.4.3 (The Whitney immersion). Consider the unit sphere in Rn+l 
sn = {(x, a) ERn x R IIIxl1 2 + a2 = I} 
and the map 
f: sn --+ en 
(x, a) f-------+ (1 + 2ia)x. 
20r a Lagrangian immersion. 

18 
In en 
The tangent space to the sphere is 
Tex,a)sn = {(~, a) ERn x R I x' ~ + aa = O} 
and the tangent mapping to f is 
T(x,a)i : T(x,a)sn ----> en 
(~, a) f------+ ~ + 2i(a~ + ax), 
The map Tex,a)i is injective for all (x, a) E STl: if Tex,a)f(~, a) = 0, then ~ = 0 
and ax = 0; if x = 0, we have a = ±1 and the equality x ' ~ + aa = 0 gives a = 0, 
Thus we have ~ = 0 and a = 0, so that f is an immersion, Moreover, we have 
w(~ + 2i(a~ + ax),( + 2i(a( + a'x)) = 2(~' (a( + a'x) - (, (a~ + ax)) 
= 2(a'~, x - a( ,x) = 0 
so that the image of T(x,a)i is an isotropic subspace of dimension n, a Lagrangian 
subspace, In conclusion, the map f is a Lagrangian immersion, It has a unique dou-
ble point (North and South poles of the sphere are mapped to 0), In dimension 1, 
this is a "figure eight", Below (in § IA.b) we will draw pictures in dimensions 1 
and 2, 
Obviously, the Whitney sphere is not the graph of a map from R n to Rn, 
Let us show that it can nevertheless be described from the graph of a map defined 
on a larger space, We start from a function 
As we have seen it above, the graph of \7 f is a Lagrangian subspace of en+k, We 
reduce en+k as in § 1,2, b using the co-isotropic subspace F = en EB R k, Here we 
intersect the graph of \7 f with F, namely we consider

The transversality assumption above is equivalent to the assumption that V is a 
submanifold of R n x R k, in other words that the map 
Rn x Rk ----> Rk 
(x, a) f------+ (:: '" , , :~) 
is a submersion along V, In terms of partial derivatives, this is to say that the 
matrix

has maximal rank k. In terms of tangent subspaces, this is to say that the La-
grangian subspaces that are tangent to the graph of \7 f are transversal to the 
co-isotropic subspace F. The reduction lemma 1.2.3 says that the map 
v --+ Rn x Rn = en

Example 1.4.5 (Unfolding). Unfoldings are deeply related with Lagrangian sub-
manifolds (see [2]). I will not explain here the general theory but rather show an 
example. Let P E R[X] be a degree-(n + 1) polynomial 
where Xl, ... ,Xn-l E R. These coefficients are going to vary, this is the reason 
why they are named as variables. Call Px the polynomial corresponding to x = 
(Xl, ... 'Xn-d E Rn-l and consider the map 
f : R n- l x R --+ R 
(Xl, ... , Xn-l, a) f--------+ Px(a) 
to which we apply the previous techniques. The manifold V is 
V = {(x,a) E R n - l x R I ~~ (Xl, ... ,Xn-l,a) = o} 
= {(x,a) E R n - l x R I P~(a) = O}, 
this is the set of critical points of Px (zeroes of its derivative P~) when X varies. The 
condition that V actually be a submanifold is that the matrix of partial derivatives 
has rank 1. But

If f : V

d(j* A) = 0 and 1* A is a closed I-form on V. If, for some reason, for instance

Wave fronts 
Instead of looking at the Lagrangian immersion j, consider the projection 
v j x F 
enxR ~RnxR 
(X + iY, z) f----------+ (X, z). 
We will assume here that, at a general point of the Lagrangian, the tangent space 
is transversal to the subspace of coordinates Y. The image of the Lagrangian im-
mersion is then a hypersurface of Rn x R. This hypersurface is the wave front. 
Of course, it will in general be singular. Precisely, at a point of V where V is 
not a graph over Rn, the projection X + iY f---> X is singular. However, as 
(f x F)* ( dz - 2::7=1 yjdx]) = 0, at every point of the wave front, there is a 
tangent hyperplane, the hyperplane 
n 
Z = L YjXj in the space R n x R of (x, z) coordinates 
j=l 
at the point image of (X, Y, z). Notice that, as the coefficient of z in this equa-
tion is non zero, the hyperplane is always transversal to the z-axis. Conversely, 
if a singular hypersurface of R n x R has at every point a tangent hyperplane 
that is transversal to the z-axis, this hyperplane has a unique equation of the 
form z = 2:: YjXj and it is possible to reconstruct a (maybe singular) Lagrangian 
submanifold from the "slopes" Yj. 
We begin with an example of dimension 1, that of the Whitney immersion 
again. Notice that this is indeed an exact Lagrangian immersion: the restriction 
of the Liouville form ydx to the curve is exact because J ydx = 0 (the "algebraic" 
area surrounded by the curve is zero). A primitive of ydx is easily found. The curve 
is parametrized by t f---> (cos t, sin 2t) and 
ydx = - 2 sin 2 t cos t = - ~ d (sin:3 t) . 
3The manifold en x R is a "contact manifold" and F x f is a "Legendrian immersion" lifting 
the Lagrangian immersion F.

A map to the (x, z) space is thus 
This is depicted on Figure I.2, in an old-fashion "descriptive geometry" mood. It 
can be seen that the singular points of the (x, z) curve correspond to the tangents 
to the (x, y) curve that are vertical, and that the double point of the latter corre-
sponds to the two tangents to the wavefront (the "eye") at points with the same 
x coordinate that are parallel. 
Figure I.3 represents an example in which we start from the wave front (a 
"crossbow") to reconstruct the Lagrangian. From the wave front, it is seen that 
the Lagrangian curve has two double points and two "vertical" tangents. 
Figure I.4: Flying saucer 
Figure I.5: Cylinder 
One could wonder what it is useful for to replace an immersed curve by a 
singular one. Notice that, in higher dimensions, the wave front is a hypersurface in 
Rn xR and it replaces a submanifold of the same dimension n in Rn x Rn. Even for 
n = 2, this is very useful as this allows to represent exact Lagrangian surfaces of R 4 
by (singular) surfaces in a dimension-3 space. Here are some beautiful examples. 
Rotate the eye (Figure I.2) about the z-axis to get the flying saucer depicted on 
Figure I.4. The corresponding Lagrangian surface in R 2 X R 2 is a Lagrangian

immersion of the dimension-2 sphere in C 2 with a double point. In Exercise 1.14, 
one checks that this is, indeed, the Whitney immersion... eventually drawn in 
dimension 2! 
Figure 1.5 represents a cylinder constructed on the eye, namely a Lagrangian 
immersion of a cylinder, product of a figure eight with an interval, with two whole 
lines of singular points. 
Singularities 
Wave fronts are, as we have said it, singular hypersurfaces. We have seen, in di-
mension 1, cusps, in dimension 2, lines of cusps, but this can be more complicated, 
as Exercise 1.15 shows it. 
Wave fronts of non exact Lagrangian immersions 
Wave fronts are so nice that it is a pity not to have them for all Lagrangian 
immersions. In dimension 1, the problem is to represent by wave fronts curves 
that do not surround a zero area. Consider for instance the standard (round) 
circle in C. As J ydx -I- 0, it seems that nothing can be done. Look, however, at 
the parametrization

Figure I.7 
If we rotate the (unbounded) wave front of Figure I.6 around a line parallel 
to the z-axis that does not intersect the wave front, we get the wave front of a 
Lagrangian torus, the one depicted on Figure I. 7. One can then use the cylinder 
represented on Figure 1.5 to perform connected sums of wave fronts. This way, 
Figure 1.8 represents (the wave front of) a genus-2 Lagrangian surface. In the 
same way, one constructs Lagrangian immersions of all orientable surfaces in e 2 . 
These figures are copied from Givental's paper [13], that contains many other 
examples. 
Figure I.8: A genus-2 surface 
Remark I.4.6. Except for the torus, all the surfaces depicted here have double 
points, that show up in the wave fronts as points having the same projection on 
the horizontal plane and parallel tangent planes. It is rather easy to prove that the 
torus is the only orient able surface that can be embedded as a Lagrangian subman-
ifold in e 2 . As for non orient able surfaces, they can be embedded as Lagrangian 
surfaces when (and only when) their Euler characteristic is divisible by 4 (with 
the exception of the Klein bottle). See the pictures in [13]. As for the Klein bottle, 
it has long been unknown whether it had or had not a Lagrangian embedding. 
Mohnke [27] has recently proved that it has not. 
4This is a place where one can really appreciate the difference between closed and exact 
l-forms. 
"Notice that wave fronts are defined only up to a "vertical" translation, the actual constant 
C used in Figure 1.6 is (7r + 1) /4.

Exact Lagrangian embeddings 
Notice that, in all the examples of exact Lagrangian immersions we have given, 
there are double points. This is obviously necessary in dimension 2 (n = 1), due 
to Jordan theorem: an embedded curve cannot surround a zero area. This is also 
true in higher dimensions, due to a (hard) theorem of Gromov [16]: there is no 
exact Lagrangian submanifold in C n .

Proposition 1.4.7. The map A f-+ t AA defines a Lagrangian immersion 
<I> : An ~ 
Sym(n; C). 
Proof. As t AA = Id when A E O(n), the map <I> is well defined. Call [A] the class 
of a unitary matrix A in An. We have seen in § I.3.d that the tangent space to An 
at the point [A] can be identified with 
T[A]An = {AH I HE iSym(n;R)}. 
It is mapped into Sym(n; C) par T[A]<I> as follows 
The matrix AHt A+At Ht A has the form K -K for K = AHtA = AHA- 1 in u(n) 
and this describes all the matrices in the vector space i Sym(n; R) when H varies 
in i Sym(n; R). The image of the tangent mapping T[A]<I> is, thus, the subspace

A f-------+ (B f-+ t ABA) 
is the representation of U (n) operating on complex symmetric matrices. This image 
is, indeed, a Lagrangian subspace, being the image of the real part of the complex 
vector space i Sym( n; C) by a unitary matrix.

Tori, integrable systems 
Integrable systems (mechanical systems with many conserved quantities) yield 
many Lagrangian tori. We use here a few standard symplectic notions: Hamil-
tonian vector fields, Poisson bracket, commuting functions. See if necessary Ap-
pendix I.6.c. Recall for instance that an integrable system on en = R2n is a 
map f : R2n ---+ Rn whose components il, ... , fn are functionally independent 
commuting functions. 
This defines a local R n -action on R 2n, which is locally free at the regular 
points of the system (the points at which the derivatives of the functions fi are 
actually independent). Call Xl, .. . , Xn the Hamiltonian vector fields associated 
with the functions fi' These vector fields commute: 
The Rn-action is given by integration: 
where !.pi denotes the flow of Xi and t = (t J , ••• , tn) E Rn is close to 0 (in order 
that !.p~' be defined). This local action is indeed locally free on the open set of 
regular points because the vector fields Xi give independent tangent vectors at 
these points. 
Assume moreover that the vector fields Xi are complete, namely that the 
flows !.p~' are defined for all values of t. We then have a locally free action of Rn on 
the whole set of regular points. The vector fields Xi being tangent to the common 
level sets of the fi'S, this action preserve the level sets. The connected components 
of the regular level sets of f are thus homogeneous spaces, quotients of Rn by 
discrete subgroups. The discrete subgroups of R" are the lattices Zk in the linear 
subspaces of dimension k. The connected components of the regular level sets are 
thus diffeomorphic to Rn-k x Tk for some k such that 0 :::; k :::; n. In particular, 
the compact connected components are tori Tn and these tori are Lagrangian6 , 
they are called the Liouville tori. The next proposition is the easiest part of the 
Arnold-Liouville theorem (see for instance [2, 6]). 
Proposition 1.4.8. Compact connected components of the regular common level sets 
of an integrable system are Lagrangian tori. 
0 
There are many examples of integrable systems and thus of Lagrangian tori, 
coming from mechanical systems (spinning top, pendulum ... )7. The most classical 
example is that of the standard action of the torus 
GNotice that on a compact connected component, the flows aTe complete.

Normal bundles 
Let now f : V 
----t R n be any immersion of a k-dimensional manifold into R n . 
Consider the total space of its normal bundle 
Nf = {(x,v) E V x R n I x E V, 
v E (Txf(TxV))~}. 
It is naturally mapped into R n x R n by 
f: Nf____.RnxRn 
(x,v) ~ 
(f(x),v). 
The manifold N f has dimension k + n - k = n, and f is clearly an immersion. 
Moreover, it is Lagrangian. More precisely, we have: 
Lemma 1.4.9. If A is the Liouville form on Rn x Rn, one has 1* A = O. 
Proof. Consider a vector X E T(x.v)N f. Use the commutative diagram

= v . (Txf 0 T(x,v)7r(X)) 
= 0 since v is orthogonal to Txf(Tx V). 
D 
This method allows to construct many (non compact) examples and can be 
generalized by replacing Rn x Rn = T*Rn by the cotangent bundle T* M of a 
manifold and V ----t Rn by an immersion into M. See § II.2.a.

InC n 
IA.d The Gauss map 
Let f 
V ----+ C n be a Lagrangian immersion. Its tangent space at any point is 
a Lagrangian subspace of c n . One can globalize the data consisting of all these 
tangent spaces to define the "Gauss map" 
V~An 
x f-----+ Txf(Tx V). 
By definition of the tautological bundle (§ I.3.c), one has 
r(j)* En = TV. 
In particular, the tangent bundle to V must have the same properties as En. 
Proposition I.4.10. For a manifold to have a Lagrangian immersion into C n , it is 
necessary that the complexification of its tangent bundle be trivializable. 
0 
The converse is true, but less easy to prove. This is an application of Gromov's 
h-principle [17], see also [23]. 
Examples 1.4.11. 
(1) Spheres. We have seen examples of Lagrangian immersions 
of spheres in Cn (in § I.4.a). One deduces that T sn ®R C is a trivial complex 
bundle. Notice however that it is not true that the tangent bundle TS" itself 
is trivial (except for n = 0,1,3 and 7). 
(2) Surfaces. All orient able surfaces and half the non orient able surfaces have 
Lagrangian immersions in C 2 (as we have seen it in § 1.4. b). This is not the 
case, neither for the real projective plane nor for the connected sums of an 
odd number of copies of this plane. 
(3) Normal bundles. This is a case where the tangent bundle itself is trivial 
(before complexification): 
T(x.v)(Nf) = {(~,U) I ~ E TxV,U 1. Txf(TxV)} 
= TxV EEl Nxf 
and this is canonically isomorphic to the ambient space R n . 
(4) Grassmannians. The Gauss map cp of the Lagrangian immersion <I> 
satisfies of course 
cp: An --+ An(n+1) 
-2-
cp* En(n+1) = End Sym(En).

The Maslov class 
Every Lagrangian immersion has a Maslov class: use the Gauss map 
to pull back /1 E Hl(An; Z) to a class 
/1(1) E Hl(V; Z). 
One can also, with the notation of Remark 1.3.3, define /1(1) as the cohomol-
ogy class dual to 1'(1)-1 (2:. n ) , see [24] for example. 
1.5 
Special Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
Lagrangian submanifolds are submanifolds of C n whose tangent space at each 
point is a Lagrangian subspace. They have a Gauss map into the Grassmannian An, 
namely into U(n)j O(n). We look now at the sub manifolds whose Gauss map takes 
values in SAn = SU(n)j SO(n). These are the special Lagrangian submanifolds, 
invented by Harvey and Lawson [18]. 
I.5.a 
Special Lagrangian subspaces 
An oriented subspace P of C n is said to be special Lagrangian if it has a positive 
orthonormal basis that is a special unitary basis of C n . 
For instance, if n = 1, as C has a unique special unitary basis (the group 
SU(I) is the trivial group), there is only one special Lagrangian subspace in C, the 
line R c C ... this will not be a very interesting notion in dimension 1. Fortunately, 
for n ;::: 2, this is more exciting. Identify the space C 2 with the skew-field H of 
quaternions: 
Z = (Zl' Z2) = X + iY 
= (Xl + iYl,X2 + iY2) 
= (Xl + iyd + j(X2 + iY2) 
= (Xl + j X2) + i(Yl - jY2). 
The 2 x 2 matrices that are in SU(2) are the matrices of the form 
( Zl -_22) with IZll2 + IZ212 = 1. 
Z2 Zl 
Thus the special Lagrangian planes are those who have an orthonormal basis 
(Z, Z') with Z and Z' of the form 
{ Z,= (Xl + iYl) + j(X2 + iY2) 
Z = (-X2 + ZY2) + J(XI - ZYl). 

30 
In en 
Notice that 
Z' = [(Xl + iYl) + j(X2 + iY2)] j = Zj. 
Thus a basis (Z, Z') of e 2 is special unitary if and only if Z' = Zj. Now use 
multiplication by j to give H the structure of a complex vector space. One has: 
Proposition 1.5.1. The special Lagrangian subspaces of e 2 are the complex lines 
with respect to the complex structure defined by the multiplication by j. The Grass-
mannian SA2 is a complex projective line. 
0 
Remark 1.5.2. Notice also that SA2 = SU(2)/SO(2) = 8 3/81 . This is indeed a 
dimension-2 sphere. 
To distinguish the special Lagrangian subspaces among all the Lagrangian 
subs paces or the special unitary matrices among all the unitary matrices, one uses 
the (complex) determinant. To globalize the notion of special Lagrangian subspace 
and define special Lagrangian submanifolds, it will be practical (and natural) to 
describe the linear objects by differential forms. The form corresponding to the 
complex determinant is 
o = dZl /\ ... /\ dzn. 
Expressing the definition of the determinant, namely 
we see that, for A E GL(n; e), we have indeed 
A*O = (detA)O. 
Hence 
detA = 1 ~ 
A*O = O. 
In order to work with real subspaces, we need an additional notation: call a and 
f3 the two degree n real forms: 
a = ReO, 
f3 = ImO. 
For instance, in dimension 1, 0 = dz, a = dx and f3 = dy. In dimension 2, 
that is 
0= dzl /\ dZ2 = (dXl + idYl) /\ (dX2 + idY2) 
= dXl /\ dX2 - dYl/\ dY2 + i(dYl /\ dX2 + dXl /\ dY2), 
{ a = dXl /\ dX2 - dYl /\ dY2 
f3 = dYl /\ dX2 + dXI /\ dY2. 
Proposition 1.5.3. Let P be an oriented (real) vector subspace of dimension n in 
en. The number O(XI /\ ... /\ xn) depends only on P and not on the positive 
orthonormal basis (Xl, ... ,xn) of P used to express it. 

I.5. Special Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
31 
Proof. Consider the 2n vectors (xI, ... ,Xn,ixI, ... ,ixn) and the linear mapping 
A : en ----> en defined by the images of the vectors of the canonical basis: 
A(ej) = Xj, 
A(iej) = iXj 
(so that A is complex linear). Then 
S1(XI A ... A xn) = detc A. 
If (gXI, ... ,gxn) is a positive orthonormal basis of P (that is, if 9 E SO(n)), one 
gets 
S1(gXI A ... A gXn) = detc (gA) = detc 9 detc A = detR 9 detc A 
= detc A = S1(XI A ... A xn) 
(since 9 E SO(n) C GL(n; R) C GL(n; e)). 
o 
We will thus denote S1(P) the number S1(XIA·· ·Axn). Similarly, denote a(P) 
and (3(P) its real and imaginary parts. 
Remark 1.5.4. Notice that S1(P) is non zero if and only if the 2n vectors 
form a basis of en over R, that is, if and only if P n iP = {O} or P does not 
contain any complex line. These subspaces are said to be totally real. This is in 
particular the case for Lagrangian subspaces. 
Proposition I.S.S. A real subspace P of en has an orientation for which it is a 
special Lagrangian subspace if and only if P is Lagrangian and (3(P) = o. 
Proof. Let P be a Lagrangian subspace. Choose (Xl, ... , Xn), an orthonormal basis 
which is the image of the canonical basis of en by a unitary matrix A. Thus 
For P to have a positive basis that is special unitary, it is necessary and sufficient 
that detc A be equal to ±1, that is, that 
ImS1(P) = O. 
o 
Here is a last elementary remark on linear subspaces: 
Proposition I.S.6. Let Q c en be an oriented isotropic linear subspace of dimen-
sion n - 1. There exists a unique special Lagrangian subspace that contains Q. 
Proof. Choose a positive orthonormal basis (Xl, ... ,xn-d of Q. In the complex 
line that is the orthogonal, with respect to the Hermitian form, of the complex 
subspace spanned by the Xi'S, there is a unique vector Xn such that the basis 
(Xl, ... , Xn-l, xn) is a special unitary basis of en.

I.5.b 
Special Lagrangian submanifolds 
A Lagrangian immersion 
f: V ------+ en 
of an oriented manifold into en is special if Txf(Tx V) is a special Lagrangian 
subspace for every x. The Gauss map then takes values in SAn cAn. 
Examples 1.5.7. 
(1) In dimension 1, the tangent space must be the unique special 
Lagrangian R c e for all x. If V is connected, f must thus be the immersion 
of an open subset of R by t f-+ t + ia. We have already noticed that this 
dimension will not be very exciting. 
(2) In dimension 2, Txf(Tx V) must be a j-complex line for all x, f is thus the 
immersion of a j-complex curve into e 2 . This gives quite a lot of examples. 
Remark 1.5.8. The Maslov class of a special Lagrangian immersion into en is 
zero. Of course, as the examples above show it, there are much more Lagrangian 
immersions with zero Maslov class than there are special Lagrangian immersions. 
In terms of forms, to say that the immersion 
f: V ------+ en 
is special Lagrangian is to say that it satisfies 
• firstly 1*w = 0 (it is Lagrangian) 
• secondly 1*(3 = 0 (it is special). 
Proposition 1.5.9. If f is a special Lagrangian immersion, 1*0, is a volume form 
on V. 
Proof. The complex form 0, has type (n,O) and defines an n-form 1*0, on V, 
which is real since its imaginary part vanishes on V. Let x be a point in V and let 
(Xl, ... ,Xn ) be a basis of Tx V. One has 
because of Remark 1.5.4 and since V is Lagrangian. Thus 1*0, never vanishes. 
D 
In dimensions 1 and 2, the special Lagrangian submanifolds are non compact 
(in dimension 2, Liouville's theorem forbids complex curves in e 2 to be compact). 
This is actually always the case, a straightforward application of Proposition 1.5.9: 
Corollary 1.5.10. There is no special Lagrangian immersion from a compact man-
ifold into en. 

1.5. Special Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
33 
Proof. If f : V ----; en is a special Lagrangian immersion, f*0, is a volume form on 
V. But 0, is an exact complex form: 
Decompose Zl dZ2 1\ ... 1\ dZn into its real and imaginary parts to get 
and eventually 
f*0, = ret = d(J*ry). 
The manifold V thus has an exact volume form, and this prevents it of being 
compact. 
0 
Let us give now examples of special Lagrangian submanifolds in en, starting 
from the examples of Lagrangians constructed in section 1.4. 
I.5.c Graphs of forms 
Let us begin with Proposition 1.4.1. Let f : Rn ----; R be a function. We require the 
graph of V' f, a Lagrangian submanifold, to be a special Lagrangian submanifold. 
The n = 1 case is not interesting. For n = 2, the Lagrangian immersion associated 
with the function f is 
(
of Of) 
F : (x, y) f-------+ 
x, y, ox' oy 
and the form f3 is 
Then 
F* f3 = d ( ~~) 1\ dy + dx 1\ d ( ~~ ) 
( 02 f 02 f) 
= 
ox2 + oy2 
dx 1\ dy. 
We thus have: 
Proposition 1.5.11. Let U be an open subset oj R2 and J : U ----; R a Junction oj 
class e2 . The graph oj V' J is a special Lagrangian submaniJold oj e 2 iJ and only 
iJ J is a harmonic Junction. 
0 
Notice that the condition is linear. Starting from dimension 3, this is no more 
the case. The function J must satisfy a complicated non linear partial differential

In en 
equation, expressed in Proposition 1.5.12 below. Let us begin by a notation. Denote 
by Hess(f) the Hessian matrix of f, namely the matrix 
82f 
Hess(fkj = -8 
8 
Xi Xj 
and by (Jk(Hess(f)) the k-th elementary symmetric functions of its eigenvalues. 
More generally, for an n x n real matrix A, write 
n 
det(A-Xld) = 2:)-l)k(Jk(A)Xn - k. 
k=O 
For example, (Jl (Hess(f)) is the trace of the Hessian matrix, the Laplacian ~f 
of f. 
Proposition 1.5.12. Let U be an open subset of Rn and f : U ---+ R a function of 
class e2 . The graph of 'V f is a special Lagrangian submanifold of en if and only 
if f satisfies the partial differential equation 
2) _1)k(J2k+l(Hess(f)) = o. 
k'20 
Examples 1.5.13. For n = 1, the differential equation is f"(t) = 0 or f'(t) constant, 
and this is precisely the differential equation of the special Lagrangian submani-
folds. For n = 2, again, only (Jl appears in the (linear) relation, which expresses 
the fact that the function f must be harmonic. For n = 3, the relation is 
(Jl (Hess(f)) = (J3 (Hess(f)) 
or 
~f = det(Hess(f)). 
Remark 1.5.14. The only order-1 term (in df) in this partial differential equation is 
~f, so that the "linear part" of this equation is ~f = O. this should be compared 
with McLean's theorem (Theorem II.6.1 below). 
Proof of the proposition. The tangent space to the graph of 'V f at the point 
(x, 'V fx) is the image of the plane Rn under the linear map Id +i(d2 f)x. This 
is a special Lagrangian subspace if and only if 
1m (detc(ld +i(d2 f)x)) = O. 
We still must check that, for any real symmetric matrix A, one has 
1m (detc(Id+iA)) = 2)-1)k(J2k+l(A). 
k'20 
Since A is real symmetric, it is diagonalizable in an orthonormal basis. It is clear 
that the two sides of the relation to be proved are invariant under conjugation 
by matrices in 0 (n). One may thus assume that the matrix A is the diagonal 
()'l, ... ,An). The left hand side is then 1m TIj (l + iAj) and it clearly coincides 
with the right hand side.

I.S.d Normal bundles of surfaces 
Let f : V 
---> Rn be an immersion of a dimension-k manifold into Rn. We 
know (see § l.4.c) that its normal bundle has a natural Lagrangian immersion into 
Rn x Rn. Look now for the conditions under which this is a special Lagrangian 
immersion. 
For the sake of simplicity, suppose here that k = 2 and n = 3 (case of surfaces 
in R 3 ). There is a more general discussion in [18J. 
Fix a point Xo in V, a unit normal vector field n = n(x) on a neighbourhood 
of Xo. The restriction of the normal bundle 
to this neighborhood is isomorphic with V x R by (x,/-,,) f---+ (x,/-"n(x)). We map 
Nf to e 3 by 
(x,/-,,) f---+ /-"n(x) + if (x) 
(notice that, this time, the immersion f appears in the second copy of Rn, that 
of purely imaginary vectors). 
Let us now choose an orthonormal basis (e 1 , e2) of Txo V. Assume that this 
basis is orthogonal with respect to the second fundamental form, that is, to the 
symmetric bilinear form defined on TXD V by 
II(X, Y) = -(Txon(X), Y). 
We have 
Txon(ed = ->qel, 
T":on(e2) = -A2e2 
where Al and A2 are the two "principal curvatures" of V at Xo. 
Consider now the tangent space to N fat (xo, v) where v = /-"n(xo) E N":of = 
R· n(xo). The tangent mapping to our immersion is 
The images of the basis vectors are

O(Po) = (dz1 /\ dZ2 /\ dz3 ) (((i -/-"Aded /\ ((i -/-"A2)e2) /\ n) 
= (i - /-"Ad(i - /-"A2) , 
so that Po is a special Lagrangian if and only if /-,,(Al + A2) = O. This is to say that 
the trace of Txo n is zero. In other words, we have shown: 

36 
In en 
Proposition 1.5.15. The immersion of the normal bundle of 
into e 3 is a special Lagrangian immersion if and only if f is a minimal immersion. 
D 
For more information on minimal surfaces, see, for example, the beautiful 
surveys in [29] and the references quoted there. 
Remark 1.5.16. It is true that we have already mentioned Riemannian metrics 
in these notes, but up to now, they have had only an auxiliary role. The result 
presented here is a genuine Riemannian one. 
I.5.e From integrable systems 
Being compact, Lagrangian tori obtained as "Liouville tori" cannot be special 
Lagrangian submanifolds in en. One can try to replace them by special Lagrangian 
submanifolds with the help of the remark included in Proposition 1.5.6: the idea 
is to consider a (necessarily isotropic) subtorus in a Liouville torus Tn and to add 
a direction to construct another Lagrangian submanifold, which will be special. 
Here is an example, coming from [18], of such a construction. Start from an 
orbit L of the standard action of Tn on en (see § l.4.c), namely a common level 
set of the functions 
say gi = ai, none of the ai's being zero, so that L is a Lagrangian torus. Choose a 
subtorus of Tn: 
Let V be an orbit of this subtorus, an isotropic torus of dimension n - 1. Consider 
the Hamiltonian vector fields Yj , ... , Yn associated to the functions gi: 
{
Yl(Zl, ... ,Zn) = (iz 1,O, ... ,O) 
~'(Zl' ... 'Zn) = (O, ... ,O,izn ). 
Let Z = (Zl, . .. , Zn) be a point of V. The tangent space to L at Z is spanned by 
the values of the li's, the tangent space to V is the hyperplane consisting of the 
vectors L Aili satisfying L Ai = 0. It is spanned by the values at Z of the vector 
fields 
that are the Hamiltonian vector fields of the functions 
fl = gl - gn, ... , fn-l = gn-l - gn· 

I.5. Special Lagrangian submanifolds in en 
37 
We are looking now for an n-th function f such that the subspace spanned by 
the vectors Xl, ... , X n- l and Xj is a special Lagrangian at each point where the 
vectors are independent. The subspace F = (Xl, ... , X n- l ) is isotropic and has 
dimension n - 1. 
We look for X j as a linear combination X j = L Aj Yj such that: 
• The vector field Xj is in the subspace orthogonal to (XI, ... ,Xn- l ) (for 
the Hermitian form), that is, (Xj, Xk) = 0 for 1 :s; k :s; n - 1. This gives 
Ak IZkl2 - An IZnl2 = O. Thus Ak must have the form

Subtracting the linear combination AIXI + .. ·+An-IXn- 1 from the last vector, this 
vector becomes (AI + .. ·+An)Yn, so that the determinant is in(AI +- . ·+An)ZI ... Zn. 
We are thus looking for functions f and fJ such that 
Xj(ZI' ... ' zn) = (Alizl' ... ' Anizn)

in(fJ(Zl, ... , Zn))Zl ... Zn is real. 
For any index j, we must have:

Proof. The only thing that is left to prove is that the regular levels are "cylinders" 
T n - 1 x R. As we are dealing with an integrable system, we know that the levels 
are endowed with an Rn-action. Here the n - 1 first vector fields are periodic and 
in particular complete; the last one is complete too, because the level is a closed 
submanifold of en. The action is thus an action of Tn-l x R and this is a free 
action, as the level, being special Lagrangian, cannot be compact.

Exercise 1.19 describes essentially the same construction. 
1.5.f Special Lagrangian submanifolds invariant under SO(n) 
The next and sporadic examples also come from [18]. Start from a smooth curve

and "rotate" it with the help of the diagonal SO( n )-action, namely 
g. (X + iY) = g. X + ig· Y for 9 E SO(n) and X, Y ERn. 
If we assume the curve does not pass through 0, we get a submanifold of en: 
v = {(x + iy)u I x + iy E f, u ERn, U = g(el) for some 9 E SO(n)} 
(notice that u describes a sphere sn-l eRn). The tangent space to V at (x+iy)u 
is spanned by the vectors (x + iy) U with U E Tusn-l and the (~ + i17)U with ~ + i17 
tangent to f at x + iy. The submanifold V is always Lagrangian, as is easily 
checked: 
w((x + iy)U, (x + iy)U') = xy(U . U' - U' . U) = 0, 
w((x + iy)U, (~+ i17)U) = (X17 -
y~)U· u = O. 
It is special Lagrangian if and only if, denoting (U1, ... , Un- 1) a basis of Tusn-1, 
detc ((x + iy)U1, ... , (x + iy)Un- 1, (~+ i17)U) E R. 
But this determinant is equal to (x + iy)n-l(~ + i17) detc(U1 , ... , Un- 1, u), or to 
(x + iy)n-l (~+ i17) detR(U1 , ... ,Un- 1, u) since these vectors are in Rn c en. The 
condition is thus that 
(x + iyt-l(~ + i17) E R for any tangent vector ~ + i17 to f. 
We get eventually: 
Proposition 1.5.18. The Lagrangian submanifold of en 
V = {(x+iy)u I (x+iy) E f,u E sn-l eRn} 
is special Lagrangian if and only if, on f, the function 1m ((x + iy)n) is constant.

Remark 1.5.19. This method gives essentially one special Lagrangian submanifold 
in any dimension, which is not much! 
Remark 1.5.20. Any connected component of r is diffeomorphic to R, the special 
Lagrangian submanifolds obtained are (unions of) copies of 8 n - 1 x R. 
To draw a picture of the special Lagrangian submanifold, one draws first the 
curve r (in the (x, y) plane), then its wave front (in the (x, z) plane). One then 
notices that the Liouville form A = Y . dX is, on V: 
A = Y . dX = (yu) . d(xu) 
= (yu) . ((dx)u + xdu) 
= ydx 
(since udu = ~ IIul1 2 = 0) so that the wave front of V is 
{(xu, z) ERn x R I (x, z) is a point of the wave front of r}. 
For example, for n = 2, the curve r is a hyperbola xy = constant, its wave 
front is the curve z = log x and the wave front of the special Lagrangian subman-
ifold is the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the graph of the logarithm 
function about the z-axis (Figure 1.10).

I.6.a The topology of the symplectic group 
Proposition 1.6.1. The manifold Sp(2n) is diffeomorphic to the Cartesian product 
of the group U (n) with a convex open cone of a vector space of dimension n( n + 1). 
Corollary 1.6.2. The symplectic group Sp(2n) is path connected. The injection of 
U(n) in Sp(2n) induces an isomorphism 
Z = 7r1 U(n) ------> 7r1 Sp(2n).

Figure 1.10 
Proof of the proposition. Let A E Sp(2n). As any invertible transformation ofR2n, 
A can be written in a unique way as a product 
where 8 is the positive definite symmetric matrix 8 = -/ At A and n is the orthog-
onal matrix n = 8-1 A. As A is symplectic, the matrix 8 is also symplectic: t A 
and At A are symplectic, the matrix At A is symmetric, positive definite, thus it 
is diagonalizable in an orthonormal basis and 8 is the matrix that, in this basis, 
is the diagonal of the square roots of the eigenvalues of At A, so that 8 is indeed 
symplectic as is At A. One deduces that 
n = 8- 1 A E Sp(2n) n O(2n) = U(n) 
and thus that n is a unitary matrix. We have thus obtained a bijection 
Sp(2n) --------> U(n) x S 
A f---------+ ((-/AtA)-lA,-/AtA) 
where S denotes the set of positive definite symmetric matrices that are symplectic. 
We still have to prove that this space is an open convex cone in a vector space of 
dimension n(n + 1). Write the matrices as block matrices in a symplectic basis. 
Let 8 E S, we have 
8 = (t~~) with A 
and C positive definite symmetric and t8J8 = J. 
The last condition, that expresses the fact that 8 is symplectic, is equivalent to 
BA is symmetric and C = A- 1(Id+B 2 ). 
The mapping 
S --+ Sym(n;R) x Sym+(n;R)

is the desired diffeomorphism. The open set Sym+(n; R) of all positive definite 
symmetric real matrices is obviously an open convex cone in the vector space 
Sym(n; R) of all symmetric matrices, the product is an open convex cone of the 
product space, that has dimension 2 n(n 2+ 1) . 
0 
Proof of the corollary. The convex cone Sym(n; R) x Sym+(n; R) is contractible. 
o 
Remark 1.6.3. There is another beautiful proof of this type of contractibility re-
sults, due to Sevennec, in [5]. 
I.6.b Complex structures 
If E is a vector space endowed with a symplectic from w, it is said that an en-
domorphism J of E is a complex structure calibrated by w if J2 = - Id (J is a 
complex structure), 
w(Jv, Jw) = w(v, w) 
(J is symplectic) and 
g(v, w) = w(v, Jw) 
is a scalar product (namely a positive definite bilinear form) on E. 
I.6.c Hamiltonian vector fields, integrable systems 
In this appendix, denote for simplicity en = R2n by W. It can be replaced by any 
symplectic manifold W (see §II.1). 
Hamiltonian vector fields 
To any function H : W ----+ R, the symplectic form allows to associate a vector 
field, a kind of gradient, the Hamiltonian vector field X H (sometimes called the 
"symplectic gradient" H). This is the vector field defined by the relation 
or by 
In coordinates, one has 
XH(Xl, ... ,Xn,Yl, ... ,Yn) = (~H, ... , ~H,_~H, ... ,_~H). 
UYI 
UYn 
UXI 
UXn 
Notice that the vector field X H vanishes at x if and only if x is a critical 
point of the function H: 

42 
In en 
In particular, the singularities (or zeroes) of a Hamiltonian vector field are the 
critical points of a function. 
Notice also that the function H is constant along the trajectories, or integral 
curves, of the vector field XH: as Wx is skew symmetric, we have (dH)(XH) = 0 
or X H
· H = O. 
The Poisson bracket 
Assume now that 1 and 9 are two functions on W. Define their "Poisson bracket" 
{j, g} by the formula 
{I,g} = X f · 9 = dg(Xf)· 
In coordinates, one has 
{I g} = ~ (81 ~ 
_ 8g 81 ) 
, 
~ 8y· 8x· 
8y· 8x· 
. 
i=l 
1. 
'l. 
't 
2 
Notice that 
so that {I, g} = - {g, f}. This shows that the Poisson bracket is skew-symmetric 
in 1 and g. By definition, this is also a derivation (in both entries); in other words, 
the Poisson bracket satisfies the Leibniz identity 
{I, gh} = {I, g} h + 9 {j, h} . 
Using the general relation 
and Cartan formula 
we get 
L[xf,xg]W = £XjLXgW - LXg£XjW 
in other words 
We also have 
= dLXfLXgW + LxjdLXgW - LxgdLXjW - LXqLxjdw 
= dLXfLXgW = d(w(Xg,Xf)) = -d{j,g} , 
[Xf,Xgj· h = {{I,g}, h}. 
From this, we deduce that the Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity 
{I, {g, h}} + {g, {h, f}} + {h, {I,g}} = 0 

1.6. Appendices 
and thus defines a Lie algebra structure on eoo (W), the mapping 
eOO(W) ---> X(W) 
f f-------+ X f 
43 
being a morphism of Lie algebras from eOO(W) (with the Poisson bracket) into the 
Lie algebra of vector fields (with the Lie bracket of vector fields). 
Proof of the Jacobi identity. Apply the definition of the bracket of vector fields: 
and the equality above to get 
{{f,g},h} = [Xf,Xgj. h 
= X f . (Xg . h) ~ Xq . (Xf . h) 
= X f · {g,h} ~ X g · {j,h} 
= {j, {g, h}} ~ {g, {j, h}} . 
This, taking into account the skew-symmetry of the Poisson bracket, is equivalent 
to the Jacobi identity. 
D 
Integrable systems 
As any vector field does it, the Hamiltonian vector field X II defines a differential 
system on W, namely, 
x(t) = XII(X(t)), 
the Hamiltonian system associated with H. The function H is constant along the 
trajectories of this system, in other words 
X FI . H = 0 or dH(XII ) = O. 
It is said that H is a first integral of the system. More generally, a function 
f : W ----) R that is constant along the integral curves of a vector field X is 
called a first integral of X. In the case of a Hamiltonian vector field X II, the 
equality XII . f = 0 is equivalent to {f, H} = 0, we say that the functions f and 
H commute. 
It is said that a Hamiltonian system is integrable if it has "as many commut-
ing first integrals as possible". Let us explain this: 
• Let h, ... , fk be commuting first integrals of the system XII, so that 
{fi, fj} = 0 for all i and j. Each one is constant on the trajectories of 
the Hamiltonian system associated to each other one. 

44 
In en 
• The expression "as many as possible": at any point x of W, the subspace of 
Tx W spanned by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the functions ii is isotropic: 
Its dimension is thus at most n = 
~ dim W. It is required that, at least for 
x in an open dense subset of W, this subspace has maximal dimension n . 
• Notice that the vectors XI, are independent at x if and only if the linear 
forms (dii)x are independent. 
Definition 1.6.4. The function H or the Hamiltonian vector field X H on W is 
qualified as integrable if it has n independent commuting first integrals. 
Examples 1.6.5. Every function depending only of the coordinates Yi, 
is integrable: the functions Yi are independent commuting first integrals. Every 
Hamiltonian system on e is integrable. Similarly, a Hamiltonian system on e 2 is 
integrable if and only if it has a "second first integral" .

Lagrangian snbmanifolds

Calabi-Yan manifolds 
11.1 
Symplectic manifolds 
• In 
In order to deform a Lagrangian submanifold in en, we must understand how a 
tubular neighbourhood looks like. We prove here that a Lagrangian submanifold 
has a neighbourhood which is diffeomorphic to a neighbourhood of the zero section 
in its cotangent bundle. To be precise and explicit, we need to define a symplectic 
structure on the cotangent bundles and more generally to say what a symplectic 
structure on a manifold is. 
A symplectic manifold is a manifold W endowed with a non degenerate 2-
form w, namely, a non degenerate alternated bilinear form Wx on each tangent 
space Tx W, which is required to be closed, (dw = 0). Notice that a symplectic 
manifold is even dimensional. 
Examples II. I. I. 
(1) The first example is of course en with the symplectic form 
we have used so far, considered as a differential form: 
n 
W = L dYJ 1\ dXJ 
j=l 
(where (Xl + iYl," ., Xn + iYn) stands for the complex coordinates in en). 

50 
II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
One also has: 
n 
wz(Z, Z') = w(Z, Z') = 2)XjYj ~ XjYj) = X'· Y ~ X· y'. 
j=l 
And this is an exact, hence closed, form: 
n 
W = d(Lyjdxj). 
j=l 
(2) The next example is that of cotangent bundles. Think that Cn = Rn x Rn, 
then that Rn x Rn = T*Rn and simply replace Rn by any manifold V. On 
W = T*V, there is a canonical I-form, the Liouville form A, defined by the 
"compact" formula: 
... in which x denotes a point of V, a an element of T;V (namely a linear 
form on the tangent space Tx V), and 7f the projection T*V --> V of the 
cotangent bundle. If (Xl, ... ,Xn) are local coordinates on V and (Y1, ... ,Yn) 
the cotangent coordinates, then 
n 
A = LYjdxj. 
j=l 
The 2-form dA is both closed (!) and non degenerate. 
(3) Surfaces. On a surface W, any 2-form is closed. Moreover, in dimension 2, 
to say that a 2-form is non degenerate means that it nowhere vanishes, in 
other words that this is a volume form: all the orient able surfaces may be 
considered as symplectic manifolds. 
(4) The sphere. Consider, in particular, the unit sphere S2 in R:3, whose tangent 
space at a point v is the plane orthogonal to the unit vector v. Put 
wv(X, Y) = v· (X 1\ Y) = det(v, X, Y). 
This is a non degenerate 2-form and thus a symplectic form. 
(5) The projective space pn(c) is a symplectic manifold. The nicest thing to 
do is to define its symplectic form starting from that of C n +1 and using the 
symplectic reduction process. To define pn (C), we factor out the unit sphere 
s2n+1 of cn+1 by the Sl-action (multiplication of coordinates): 

II. 2. Lagrangian submanifolds and immersions 
51 
At each point x of the sphere S2n+l, the tangent space is the Euclidean 
orthogonal of x and the kernel of the restriction of the symplectic from is 
the line generated by ix. This line is also the tangent space to the circle 
through x on the sphere. 
The symplectic form of C n +1 defines a non degenerate alternated bilinear 
form w on pn(c). Its pull-back on the sphere is closed, so that w is closed. 
It is actually a (the standard) Kahler form on pn(c). 
(6) Complex submanifolds of the projective space are symplectic. The compati-
bility of w with the complex structure gives that w(X, iX) > 0 for any vector 
X that is tangent to the submanifold, so that w is indeed non degenerate on 
this submanifold. 
(7) More generally, all Kahler manifolds are symplectic. We will come back to 
this remark. 
Notice that, on cotangent bundles, as on C n , the symplectic form is exact. 
This cannot be the case on a compact symplectic manifold. 
Proposition 11.1.2. On a compact manifold, there exists no 2-form that is both non 
degenerate and exact. 
Proof. Let w be a non degenerate 2-form on the 2n-dimensional manifold W. To 
say that w is non degenerate is to say that w/\n is a volume form. But then, if 
w=dQ, 
w/\n = d(Q 1\ W/\(n-l)) 
is also exact, thus W cannot be compact. 
D 
Hamiltonian vector fields X H for functions H : W ---+ R are defined exactly as 
in Appendix I.6.c and so is the Poisson bracket of two functions on W. Exercise II.3 
explains why it is required that a symplectic form be closed. 
II.2 
Lagrangian submanifolds and immersions 
An immersion f : L ---+ W into a symplectic manifold is Lagrangian if 1* w = 0 
and dim W = 2dimL. 
II.2.a In cotangent bundles 
All what was done in C n in § I.4.a works as well in a cotangent bundle. 

52 
II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Graphs 
Proposition I.4.I generalizes as: 
Proposition 11.2.1. Let a : L ----+ T* L be a section of a cotangent bundle. Its image 
is a Lagrangian submanifold if and only if the I-form a is closed. 
Proof. The most elegant thing to do is to state first a property of the Liouville 
form (which explains why it is called the "canonical" I-form): for any form a, one 
has 
a*A = a. 
In this equality, a is considered as a section of the cotangent bundle in the left 
hand side and as a form in the right hand side. One has indeed: 
(a*A)x(Y) = A(x,ax)(Txa(Y)) 
by definition of a* 
= a x(T(x,a x )7r 0 Txa(Y)) by definition of A 
= ax(Y) 
because a is a section. 
Eventually, a*w = 0 if and only if d(a* A) = 0, thus the graph of a is a Lagrangian 
submanifold if and only if a is closed. 
D 
Remark II.2.2. In particular, the zero section of L c T* L is a Lagrangian sub-
manifold. What we plan to do next is to show that L c T* L is a model for all 
Lagrangian embeddings of L into a symplectic manifold (Theorem II.3. 7). 
Generating functions 
A function 
F: M x Rk -----> R 
allows to construct a Lagrangian submanifold (the graph of dF) into T* M x C k 
and then, by reduction, a Lagrangian immersion into T*M. 
Wave fronts 
Exact Lagrangian immersions into T* M define wave fronts in M x R and con-
versely. 
Conormal bundles 
Let 
f: V -----> M 
be any immersion. The conormal bundle is the subbundle of the pull back bundle 
j*T* M = {(x, tp) I x E V, tp E Tj(x)M} -----> V 

II. 3. Tubular neighborhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds 
defined by 
N* f = {(x,<p) E j*T* M I <PITxf(Tx V ) = o} 
= {(x,<p) E j*T*M I <poTxf = o}. 
Map N* f into T* M by 
F: (x, <p) f----------+ (f(x), <p). 
This is an immersion, since 
53 
It is Lagrangian, as we have F* A = O. Indeed, calling 7r the two projections T* M ----+ 
M et N* f ----+ V, we get 
(F* A)(x.'P) (X) = AU(x),'P) (T(x.'P)F(X)) 
= <p (TU(x),'P)7r 0 T(x''P)F(X)) 
= <p (Txf(T(x.'P)7r(X))) 
=0 
as <p vanishes on the vectors that are tangent to V. 
o 
One should check that the proof given for the normal bundle in § I.4.c for 
the case where M = Rn is identical to the one given here, the orthogonality used 
there being an ersatz of the duality used here. 
II.3 
Tubular neighborhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds 
Let us now present a method, invented by Moser [28], which allows to describe a 
symplectic manifold in the neighbourhood of a point (they are all the same) or a 
neighbourhood of a Lagrangian submanifold in a symplectic manifold. 
II.3.a 
Moser's method 
The next "lemma" contains all these results. 
Lemma 11.3.1. Let W be a 2n-dimensional manifold and let Q c W be a compact 
submanifold. Assume that Wo and WI are two closed 2-forms on W such that, at 
any point x of Q, Wo and WI are equal and non degenerate on TxW. Then there 
exists open neighborhoods 170 and VI of Q and a diffeomorphism 
such that ?jJIQ = IdQ and ?jJ*Wl = Woo

II. In symplectic and Calabi- Yau manifolds 
Remark 11.3.2. It is not easy to create a diffeomorphism "ex nihilo". The remark-
able idea of Moser is to construct a whole path of diffeomorphisms starting from 
the identity and ending at some diffeomorphism which has the desired property. 
Let us write the proof of Moser lemma when W = en and explain then what 
should be done to get it in the general case (essentially to replace the Euclidean 
structure by a Riemannian metric). Consider the normal bundle to Q in en, 
NQ = {(x, v) E Q x en I v ..l TxQ} 
and the open subset 
liE = {(x,v) E NQ Illvll < E}. 
Notice firstly that: 
Lemma II.3.3. Let Q be a compact submanifold of the Euclidean space Rm. For E 
small enough, the map 
E: NQ -------+ Rm 
( x, v) f----------+ X + v 
is a diffeomorphism from liE onto its image. 
Proof. In a neighbourhood of a point Xo of Q, we describe Q by local coordinates 
U = (Ul,"" Uk), namely by a mapping x : U ---+ Rm where U is open in Rk and 
x(O) = Xo. One can choose vector fields (Vl(U), ... , Vm~k(U)) of Rm on U, that 
form, for all u, an orthonormal basis of the normal space of Q at x( u). So we have 
local coordinates (Ul,"" Uk, h, ... , tm~k) on NQ in which the mapping E is 
m~k 
E(u, t) = x(u) + L t;v;(u). 
The partial derivatives are 
;=1 
{ 
aE = ox + L . tj aVj 
au;

J 
au; 
aE 
atk = Vk· 
The matrix of partial derivatives is invertible for t = 0, thus it is invertible also 
for Iltll small enough1 . We conclude globally using the compactness of Q. 
D 
Call 170 the image of a suitable liE' This is a neighbourhood of Q in en. 
Lemma II.3.4. On 170 , the 2-form T = WI -
Wo is exact. 
1 It is interesting to see "how far" we can go. This leads to the notion of focal point, see for 
example [26]. 

II. 3. Tubular neighborhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds 
55 
First proof. The vector bundle NQ retracts on its zero section. The inclusion 
j : Q -> Vo thus induces an isomorphism j* : H'bR(VO) -> H'bR(Q). As j*[WI] = 
j*[woJ, the cohomology classes of WI and Wo are equal in H'bR(VO), which means 
that their difference is an exact form. 
0 
Second proof. We explicitly construct a I-form a that is a primitive of T. Consider 
the dilatation of factor t in the fibers 
<Pt : 
Vo -----; Vo 
x + V f------+ X + tv 
t E [0,1]. 
This is a diffeomorphism (onto its image) for t > ° and we have <Po (Vo) = Q, 
<PI = Idvo and <ptlQ = IdQ. The form T = WI -wo is a 2-form on en. Consider its 
restriction to Vo. It is identically zero along Q by assumption. We have 
Consider now the (time depending) radial vector field X t (tangent to the 
dilatation) on Vo. This is the vector field defined by 
It is defined only for t > 0, in the same way that <Pt is a diffeomorphism only for 
t > 0. In a very concrete way, the vector field is 
1 
Xt(x + v) = -v. 
t 
For all t, consider also the I-form at defined by 
Notice that, if y is in Q, one has 
thus at is zero along Q. For t > 0, one has 
(<p; LXt T)x+v (Y) = (LXt T)x+tv (Xt(x + tv), Tx+v( <Pt)(Y)) 
= Tx+tv(V, Tx+v(<pt)(Y)) 
= a;+v(Y). 
Hence, for t > 0,

and consequently 
Eventually, we get 
dcrt = d(tp7~XtT) 
= tp7 (d~Xt T + ~XtdT) 
= tp7 (L Xt T) 
= :t (tp;T). 
t 
d ( * ) 
dcr = dt tpt T 
for t > 0 and thus also for all t E [0,1]. Now 
T = T - 0 = tptT - tp5T = r1!!:..- (tp;T) dt = r 1 (dcrt)dt = dcr 
Jo dt 
Jo 
writing cr = Jo1 crtdt. We has thus proved that, in a neighbourhood of Q, W1 -Wo = 
dcr is an exact form (with cr identically zero on Q). 
D 
To finish the proof of Lemma 11.3.1, we use the actual method of Moser. We 
consider the path of symplectic forms 
Wt = Wo + t(W1 - wo) = Wo + tdcr. 
For t = 0, this is the non degenerate form Woo Also, along Q, this is the very 
same form Woo Restricting again Vo if necessary (using compactness again) one 
can assume that Wt is non degenerate on Vo for all t E [0,1]. Let yt be the vector 
field defined by 
~YtWt = -cr 
(the existence and uniqueness of yt are consequences of the fact that Wt is non 
degenerate). Let 1/;t be its flow: 
We have 
! (1/;;Wt) = 1/;; (:tWt + LYtWt) 
= 1/;; (d(cr) + d~Ytwt) 
= d (1/;;(cr + ~YtWt)) 
=0 
by definition of yt. Hence 1/;tWt = 1/;owo = Wo and eventually 
1/;tw1 = Woo

II. 3. Tubular neighborhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds 
57 
Remark II.3.5. In a general symplectic manifold W, the proof is identical to the one 
given here; what we need is the notion of a normal bundle, that is, of orthogonality 
in TW, and a way to replace the mapping (x, v) f---' X + v. One uses a Riemannian 
metric on Wand its exponential mapping: the point expv (x) that replaces x + v is 
the point reached at time 1 by a geodesic2 starting from x (at time 0) with tangent 
vector v. 
The most direct application of Lemma 11.3.1 is the Darboux theorem. This 
is the case where Q is a point xo, WI is a symplectic form on Wand Wo is the 
symplectic form induced on Txo W. 
Theorem 11.3.6 (Darboux theorem). Let x be a point of a manifold W endowed 
with a symplectic form w. There exists local coordinates 
centered at x in which W = E dYi 1\ dXi' 
Proof. The form induced by WI on Txo W defines, using a diffeomorphism from 
a neighbourhood of 0 in Txo W onto a neighbourhood of Xo in W, a symplectic 
form Wo on a neighbourhood of Xo. Lemma 11.3.1 gives a diffeomorphism 'IjJ from a 
neighbourhood of Xo into itself, that fixes Xo and satisfies 'IjJ*WI = Woo By definition 
of wo, there exists local coordinates centered at Xo in which it can be written 
E~I\~. 
D 
II.3.b 
Tubular neighborhoods 
The next application is a theorem of Weinstein that describes the tubular neigh-
borhoods of the Lagrangian submanifolds. 
Theorem 11.3.7 (Weinstein [34]). Let (W, w) be a symplectic manifold and let 
LeW be a compact Lagrangian submanifold. There exists a neighbourhood No 
of the zero section in T* L, a neighbourhood Vo of L in Wand a diffeomorphism 
'P : No ----> Vo such that 
'P*W = -dA and 'PIL = Id. 
Proof. Let us check that we can apply Lemma 11.3.1. The submanifold Q is the 
Lagrangian submanifold L and the form Wo is the restriction of w. The form WI 
is the symplectic form of T* L. We are going to compare them in T* L. As in the 
previous proof, let us assume firstly that W = en. Let 'P be the composed mapping 
T* L ------+ 
N L 
------+ en 
( x, Q) f----------t (x, J v CY.) f----------t X + J v CY. 
2To extend the geodesics, we also need an assumption on the completeness of the metric, or 
on the manifold W. 

58 
II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
where 
• a f---+ Va is the isomorphism between cotangent and tangent spaces given by 
the Euclidean structure of en restricted to L: 
• J is the multiplication by i. Recall (see Lemma 1.2.1) that L is Lagrangian 
if and only if T L.1. = JT L. 
Call No a neighbourhood of the zero section in T* L, mapped onto a suitable 
Uc , so that <p : No ---+ en is a diffeomorphism onto its image. We want to compare, 
in No c T* L, the two forms WI = -d)'" and Wo = <p*w. To apply Lemma II.3.1, we 
have to check that they coincide along the zero section. 
Let (x,O) E L c No. We have 
T(x,o)No = T(x,o) (T* L) = TxL EEl T; L. 
Recall that there is an exact sequence 
O 
K 
'T' 
'T' 
(T*L) T(x,a)7r T L 
0 
------; 
er -'- (x,a) 7r ------; -'- (x,a) 
) x ------; 
which splits along the zero section s, using 
TxL ~ 
T(x,o) (T*L) , 
and that the kernel Ker T(x.a) 7r is canonically identified with T; L. Compute then 
<p*w along the zero section. For V, w E TxL and a, (3 E T; L, we have 
(<p*W)(x,O) ((v, a), (w, (3)) = w'P(dl) (v + Jva, w + JV(3) 
= Wx (v + JV O!) w + JV(3) 
= (v, v(3) - (w, va) 
= (3(v) - oo(w). 
But we have seen (in Exercise 11.1) that 
(d)"')(x.o) ((v, a), (w, (3)) = (2: dYj /\ dXj) ((v, a), (w, (3)) = oo(w) - (3(v). 
The forms <p*w and -d)'" coincide along the zero section, therefore we can apply 
the lemma. 
D 
In the general situation where W is a symplectic manifold, we need a Rie-
mannian metric and an analogue of J. We use an "almost complex structure" J 
calibrated by w, namely an endomorphism J of the tangent bundle TW such that 
J2 = -Id and 
(X, Y) f-----7 w(X, JY) 
is a Riemannian metric. Such structures exist and form a contractible set. See 
for instance [5, 24]. Notice that this notion is a globalization of the linear notion, 
mentioned in § 1.6.b. 

II. 3. Tubular neighborhoods of Lagrangian submanifolds 
59 
II.3.c 
"Moduli space" of Lagrangian submanifolds 
We consider now, for a given manifold L, the space of Lagrangian immersions 
f:L--+W. 
We call it a "space" because this set is actually a topological space, a fact which 
allows to consider immersions that are "close" to a given immersion. We use the 
Whitney C1-topology. 
The C1-topology 
Let V and W be two manifolds. The C1-topology is a topology on the space of C1_ 
maps from V to W. Consider the vector bundle 'c(TV, TW) over V x W, the fiber 
at (x, y) of which is the vector space ,c (Tx V, Ty W). The total space is usually called 
Jl(V, W) rather than £.,(TV, TW). Every map f E C1(V, W) defines a mapping 
j1 f: V --+ J 1(V, W) 
x>-----+ (x, f(x), Txf). 
If U is an open subset of J1 (V, W), denote 
\7(U) = {J E C1(V, W) I jIf E U}. 
The C1-topology is the topology for which the \7(U) are a basis. It is said that a 
map f is "C 1 -close" to fo if it is close to fo for the C I-topology. 
Diffeomorphism group 
The group of diffeomorphisms of L acts on this space by rp. f = f 0 rp-l. We want 
to consider Lagrangian immersions only up to this action: we do not want to take 
into account the way the manifold L is "parametrized". 
Moduli space 
We consider the space of Lagrangian C1-immersions from L to W up to the action 
of the diffeomorphism group. The quotient space is called the "moduli space" of 
Lagrangian immersions from L to Wand denoted ,c (L ). The next theorem de-
scribes the Lagrangian immersions that are close to a fixed Lagrangian embedding 
of L into W. 
Theorem 11.3.8. Let L be a compact and connected manifold. A neighbourhood of 
a Lagrangian embedding 
L--+W 
in the space 'c(L) can be identified with a neighbourhood of 0 in the vector space 
of closed I-forms of class C1 on L. 

60 
II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Proof. Let fo : L 
----+ W be a Lagrangian embedding and f : L 
----+ W be a 
Lagrangian immersion close to fo. In particular, f is close to fa for the "Co_ 
topology3", we can consider that everything lies in a neighbourhood of L. Thanks 
to the tubular neighbourhood theorem (here Theorem II.3.7) we can assume that 
everything takes place in a neighbourhood of the zero section in T* L. The map f is 
C1-close to the inclusion of the zero section L ----+ T* L (this is what fo has become 
when we have identified the neighbourhood of fo(L) in W with a neighbourhood 
of the zero section in T* L). Thus the composition of f with the projection of the 
cotangent is a C1-mapping L ----+ L, close to the identity. Recall the next lemma, 
which is a consequence of the inverse function theorem. 
Lemma 11.3.9. Let L be a compact and connected manifold. Let f be a C1-map 
L ----+ L that is C1-close to the identity. Then f is a diffeomorphism. 
0 
According to this lemma, the composition is a diffeomorphism g of L. Com-
posing with g-l, we get an embedding 
a:L~T*L 
which is still C1-close to the zero section ... but now the composition 
L~T*L~L 
is the identity. Thus a is a section, that is, a I-form on L, and a is closed because 
the embedding is Lagrangian. Conversely, all the closed I-forms that are close to 
the zero section define Lagrangian embeddings close to fo. 
0 
Remark II.3.10. One should have noticed that the section L --+ T* L defined by a 
I-form is a C1-mapping if and only if the form is a C1-form. The C1-topology thus 
defines the structure of a topological vector space on the space of I-forms. In § II.6 
below, we will need a Banach space structure. 
Remark II.3.11. The vector space we have obtained is infinite dimensional. It can 
be considered as a neighbourhood of fo in the "manifold" of deformations of fo, 
or as its tangent space at fo. 
II.4 
Calabi-Yau manifolds 
We want now to describe, in a way analogous to what we have done in § II.3.b, the 
moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds. In order to apply Theorem II.3.7 
(special Lagrangian submanifolds are, firstly, Lagrangian submanifolds) we need 
a compactness assumption on the Lagrangian submanifold. Unfortunately, as we 
have seen it in § 1.5.b, the special Lagrangian submanifolds of en are never com-
pact. We thus need to consider more general manifolds, in which it is possible to 
define special Lagrangian submanifolds. These are the "Calabi-Yau" manifolds. 
:lThe CD-topology, defined similarly to the C1-topo!ogy, is simply the compact open topology. 

II. 4. Calabi-Yau manifolds 
61 
The point is to define a structure that globalizes the structures on en which 
have allowed us to speak of special Lagrangian submanifolds. Recall that, in addi-
tion to the R-bilinear alternated form w, we have used the form n = dz1/\·· ·/\dzn 
of the complex determinant. 
We will use here the best adapted definition of a Calabi-Yau manifold, the 
point is not to spend time on the Calabi-Yau manifold itself but rather on its 
special Lagrangian submanifolds. For more information on Calabi-Yau manifolds, 
see [33, 8] and the references they contain. 
II.4.a Definition of the Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Our manifolds should be complex and endowed with a symplectic form wand a 
type-(n,O) holomorphic form n that is nowhere zero (this is sometimes called a 
holomorphic volume form). Consider thus a manifold M, on which are given 
• a complex structure J (multiplication by i), 
• a closed non degenerate type (1, I)-form w (the Kahler form) 
• a Riemannian metric 
g(X, Y) = w(X, iY), 
• a Hermitian metric 
h(X, Y) = g(X, Y) - iw(X, Y), 
• a trivialization of the "canonical" bundle N'T* M, namely a type-(n, 0) holo-
morphic form n which is nowhere zero. 
We still need a relation between the forms wand n. Notice that both forms wAn 
and n /\ n are of type (n, n) and both do not vanish on M, in particular, both are 
volume forms. We thus have 
n /\ n = jw An 
for some function j on M. The additional compatibility condition is that j should 
be constant. Let us look at the case of en. We have 
Writing 
n 
wn = ('2:JdYj /\ dXjtn = n!(dY1/\ dxd /\ ... /\ (dYn /\ dXn).

We will use the same normalization formula to define a Calabi-Yau manifold in

Definition Ir.4.I. A complex manifold M is said to be a Calabi-Yau manifold if 
it is Kahler, has a trivialized canonical bundle, and if the Kahler form wand the 
type-(n,O) form 0 trivializing the bundle AnT*M are related by

Remark 11.4.2. Recall that it is possible to express the fact that the form w is 
Kahler by saying that the complex structure is "parallel" with respect to the Levi-
Civita connection associated with the metric it defines with w. Similarly, it is 
possible to express the compatibility condition for 0 by saying that it is parallel 
with respect to the same connection. 
Remark 11.4.3. In general, it is required that the Kahler metric be complete, in 
other words that it is possible to extend geodesics. This is equivalent to requiring 
that the manifold be complete (in the sense of metric spaces). 
II.4.b Yau's theorem 
Consider a (complex algebraic) projective smooth manifold M of complex dimen-
sion n. Assume that all the HP.O(M) are zero for 1 :S p :S n - 1 and that the 
canonical bundle AnT* M = KM is trivialized by a type-(n, 0) form O. Notice that 
M is Kahler, call the Kahler form w. Rescaling w if necessary, we get 
A hard theorem of Yau [35] asserts that there exists a unique Kahler form won M 
such that [w] = [w] E HbR(M) and which, together with 0, gives M the structure 
of a Calabi-Yau manifold.

Affine quadrics 
We have defined in § 11.1 a symplectic form on the unit sphere S2 C R:) by the 
formula 
wx(X,X') = det(x,X,X'). 
Similarly, the formula 
nz(z, Z') = detc(z, Z, Z') 
defines a "holomorphic symplectic" form of the complex quadric 
Q = {(Zl, Z2, Z3) 1 zi + z~ + z:~ = 1}. 
In "differential" terms, 
n = zl dz2 1\ dZ3 + Z2dz3 1\ dZl + Z3dzl 1\ dz2. 
On the open subset of Q where Z3 i- 0, Zl and Z2 are coordinates and, using the 
relation 
we can write 
so that 
-
1 
n 1\ n = --2dz1 1\ dZ2 1\ dZ1 1\ dz2. 
IZ:ll 
Modifying the restriction Wo to Q of the standard Kahler form of C:l , let us 
construct a Kahler form w on Q such that 
1 
-
w 1\ w = 4n 1\ n. 
Call h the restriction to Q of the function 1 Z 12. We look for w of the form 
i 
-
w=288(joh) 
for some function f. A straightforward computation (see also [31]) shows that 
f(h) = V71+T works. 
The quadric Q, equipped with nand w is (thus) a Calabi-Yau manifold. 
Recall that Q is diffeomorphic to the tangent bundle T S2 by 
Q -------+ T S2 
X + iY f----------+ 
( 
X 
, Y) 
V1 + 11Y112 
In this way, what we have got is the structure of a Calabi-Yau manifold on the 
tangent (or cotangent) bundle of the sphere S2. It is possible (but a little more 
complicated) to do the same for the cotangent bundles of all the spheres sn and 
more generally for those of all "rank-1 symmetric spaces" (see [31]). 

64 
II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Remark 11.4.4. Recall that we have identified C 2 with the skew field H of quater-
nions (in § 1.5.a). Similarly, the surface Q has the structure of a "quaternionic" or 
"hyperkahler" manifold. 
Call I the complex structure defined on Q by that of C 3 (this is the multi-
plication by i) and notice that the symmetric bilinear form that is an equation for 
Q is still non degenerate when restricted to z~ = TzQ. Define an operator Jz on 
the tangent space TzQ by the fact that Jz(Z) is the unique vector in TzQ that is 
orthogonal to Z for the complex bilinear form and such that 
detc(z, Z, Jz(Z)) = IIZI1 2 . 
This is an almost complex structure since 
thus f; = - 1d. This is an isometry since 
IIJZI1 2 = detc(z, JZ, J2(Z)) = detc(z, JZ, -Z) = IIZI1 2 . 
Moreover, J "anti-commutes" with I: 
We thus have 
detc(z,IZ,JIZ) = IIIZI1 2 = IIZI1 2 on the one hand 
= idetc(z, Z, JIZ) by linearity. 
detc(z, Z, JIZ) = -i IIZI1 2 = - detc(z, Z,I JZ) 
so that J I = - I J. Hence I, J and I J form a quaternionic structure on Q. On Q, 
we thus have 
• the Kahler form w, 
• the complex structure I defined by multiplication by i in C 3 , 
• the associated Riemannian metric g, so that w(X, IY) = g(X, Y), 
• the "holomorphic symplectic form" n, 
• the complex structure J defined in such a way that n be a J-Kahler form, 
associated with the same metric g. 
It is said that Q is hyperkahler. See Exercise II.7 for a kind of converse statement. 
Let us give now a few examples of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

II. 4. Calabi-Yau manifolds

Elliptic curves 
The quotient M of C by a lattice A is an elliptic curve. The two forms 
1 
W = 2i dz 1\ dz and n = dz 
give it the structure of a dimension-1 Calabi-Yau manifold. One can, more gen-
erally, perform the quotient of cn by a lattice. It is time for a remark: no other 
"explicit" example of compact Calabi-Yau manifold is known. In all the known 
examples, the existence of the Kahler metric with all the desired properties is 
obtained as a consequence of the Yau theorem (§II.4.b). 
Hypersurfaces 
Recall that complex elliptic curves can be considered as degree-3 curves in P2(C), 
thanks to the Weierstrass r-function. They are thus the n = 1 case in the next 
theorem. 
Theorem 11.4.5. A degree-d hypersurface in pn+ 1 (C) is a dimension-n Calabi- Yau 
manifold if and only if d = n + 2. 
Proof. The condition on the degree is necessary, as we show it now by the compu-
tation of the first Chern classes. We want that the bundle A nT* M be trivializable, 
we must thus have C1 (T* M) = -C1 (T M) = O. Calling j the inclusion of M in 
pn+1(C), we have 
since the normal bundle of Min pn+1(C) is tJ(d). Denoting by t the dual class to 
the hyperplane section in H2(pn+1(C)) , we have 
(n+2-d)j*t=O 
so that d = n + 2. 
Assume conversely that d = n + 2. Let us construct explicitly a holomorphic 
n-form on M. Let F be a degree-(n + 2) homogeneous polynomial that describes 
the hypersurface M. Every point of M lies in an affine chart Zi -I- 0 of pn+ 1 (C). 
In affine coordinates Zk = Zk/Zi, there is an index j such that

a consequence of the theorem of Yau (§ II.4.b) that there is, indeed, in the same 
cohomology class as the standard Kahler form w, another Kahler form w + iDarp 
giving a Calabi-Yau structure on M. 
D 
Remark II.4.6. The form 0 above is defined as "Poincare residue4" starting from

Special Lagrangian submanifolds 
An immersion f : V ---+ M from a manifold of real dimension n into a Calabi-
Yau manifold M of complex dimension n is said special Lagrangian if it satisfies 
f*w = 0 and f*f3 = O. As in the case of cn, the form f*0 = f*a is then a volume 
form.

II.5.a Real manifolds 
A complex analytic manifold is real if it is endowed with a "real structure", that 
is, with an anti-holomorphic involution S : an involution such that, for any holo-
morphic function f over an open subset U of M, f 0 S is a holomorphic function. 
For example, on the algebraic submanifolds of pN (C) described by real polyno-
mial equations, the complex conjugation is an anti-holomorphic involution. These 
manifolds are thus real manifolds. In particular, the projective space pN (C) itself 
is a real manifold. 
The real part, or set of real points of a real manifold is, by definition, the 
set of fixed points of S. For example, the real part of the real manifold pN (C) is 
pN (R). Notice that there exists respectable real manifolds that have no real point 
at all, as is, for example, the "Euclidean quadric" 
N+1 
l:X;=O 
i=l 
in pN(C).

Proposition 11.5.1. The real part of a real manifold of complex dimension n, if it is 
non empty, is a submanifold all connected components of which have dimension n. 
Proof. The connected components of the set of fixed points of the action of a 
finite group (here the order-2 group generated by 8) are always submanifolds. The 
tangent space at x to such a component is the subspace of fixed points of the 
R-linear involution a = TxS. 
The fact that 8 is a real structure implies that f 0 a is a complex linear form 
for any complex linear form f on the tangent space at x. We have to check that 
the fixed subspace of a has dimension n. To do this, we simply verify that the 
eigensubspaces associated with the eigenvalues 1 and -1 are isomorphic. Indeed, 
if a(X) = X, then for any complex linear form f, we have 
f 0 a(iX) = if 0 a(X) = if(X) = f( -iX). 
For any complex linear form f, we thus have 
f(a(iX)) = f( -iX) 
so that a(iX) = -iX. Hence, there are "as many" eigenvectors for the eigenvalue 
-1 than there are for the eigenvalue 1.

Real Calahi-Yau manifolds 
A Calabi-Yau manifold is real if it is both a Calabi-Yau manifold and a real 
manifold, with a couple of compatibility conditions 
8*w = -wand S*0, = n 
(similarly to what happens in C n with the complex conjugation and the two usual 
forms 0, and w). 
Examples 11.5.2. 
• The affine quadric I:: zf = 1 of C:l, endowed with the com-
plex conjugation of coordinates is a real manifold. It is also clear that this is 
a real Calabi-Yau manifold. Its real part is simply the unit sphere 8 2 C R:l. 
If we consider Q as the tangent bundle to S2, notice that the complex con-
jugation is the multiplication by -Ion the fibers and that the real part is 
the zero section . 
• A real hypersurface of degree n+2 in pn+l(C) is a real Calabi-Yau manifold. 
This is checked by computing 8*0, and 8*(w + i88<p) , for 8 the involution 
induced by the real structure (complex conjugation) of pn+l(c) and 0" w 
as in the proof of Theorem 11.4.5.

The example of elliptic curves 
Let us come back to the example of r = C/ A where A is a lattice that we assume 
here to have the form 
A = {m + nT I m, n E Z} 
for some fixed T such that 0 ::; Re( T) < 1 et Im( T) > O. To define a real structure 
on C/ A from the complex conjugation in C, it is necessary that A be invariant, 
that is, that 
f = m+nT 
for some m, n E Z. Considering the real and imaginary parts of T, it is seen that 
m = 2Re(T), thus Re(T) = ~ or O.

In the second case, the real part of r has two connected components, but in 
the first case, it has only one, as can be seen solving the equation 
z= z+m+nT 
in both cases. These components are depicted in bold on Figure 11.1. 
Notice (although this is a trivial remark) that the lines that are parallel to 
the x axis constitute a real foliation of C/ A by circles (dimension-l tori) that are 
special Lagrangian submanifolds of r, represented by dotted lines on Figure 11.1. 
The space of these special Lagrangian submanifolds is parametrized by the axis 
generated by T or rather by its image in r, a circle. 
We shall see more generally in § 11.6 that the moduli space of special La-
grangian submanifolds in a Calabi-Yau manifold is, in the neighbourhood of a 
submanifold V, a manifold whose dimension is the first Betti number of V (here 
V is a circle and its first Betti number is 1). 
II.5.d 
Special Lagrangians in real Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Assume now that M is a real Calabi-Yau manifold. We know that 
S*w = -wand S*fj = n. 

II. 5. Special Lagrangians in real Calabi-Yau manifolds 
69 
Assume now that the real part MR is not empty. Call j the inclusion of MR into 
M. We have 50 j = j and in particular 
j*w = (50 j)*w = j*(5*w) = j*( -w) = -j*w 
hence j*w = O. Similarly 
j*O = (50 j)*O = j*(5*O) = j*n = j*O 
thus j* (3 = O. We have proved: 
Proposition 11.5.3. Let M be a real Calabi- Yau manifold. The real part of M, if it 
is not empty, is a special Lagrangian submanifold of M. 
0 
Let us describe now a few examples of this situation. 
The affine quadric 
The sphere 52 is a special Lagrangian sub manifold of the affine quadric Q E C 3 . 
In other words, with the Calabi-Yau structure on T 52 defined in § H.4.c , the zero 
section is a special Lagrangian submanifold. 
In the next examples, we consider a smooth hypersurface defined by a real 
homogeneous polynomial of degree n + 2 in pn+l(C), with its real Calabi-Yau 
structure. 
Elliptic curves 
The n = 1 case, that of plane cubics, is isomorphic to the example of quotients of C 
by lattices (§ II.5.c). The real part of a plane cubic has zero, one or two connected 
components (see Figure 11.1). All components are (topologically) circles. Cubics 
are foliated by special Lagrangian circles, drawn in dotted lines on Figure ILL 
Degree-4 surfaces 
Consider now real algebraic surfaces of degree 4 in P3(C) (the real part of this 
subject has been investigated and explained in [21]). Here is an example from [9]. 
Consider the real polynomial 
that describes a smooth surface M which has a non empty real part MR. This real 
part is 
Normalize the non zero vectors of R4 by the choice, in each real line through zero, 
of one of the two vectors such that

Then MR is the quotient 
{(XO, Xl), (X2' X3) E R2 X R2 I X6 + xi = x~ + xj = I} /(u, v) '" (-u, -v). 
It is clear that the curve C described in R2 by the equation x4 + y4 = 1 is 
diffeomorphic to a circle (radially). Eventually 
MR = (C x C)/((u,v) '" (-u - v)) 
is diffeomorphic to a torus. We have thus found a special Lagrangian torus in the 
Calabi-Yau surface M. 
II.6 
Moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds 
We want now an analogue of Theorem II.3.8, more precisely a description of a 
neighbourhood of a given special Lagrangian submanifold in the space of all special 
Lagrangian submanifolds. 
Theorem 11.6.1 (McLean [25]). Let V be a compact manifold. The moduli space 
of the special Lagrangian embeddings of V in the Calabi- Yau manifold M is a 
manifold of finite dimension bl (V) = dim HI (V; R). Its tangent space at a given 
point is isomorphic to the vector space of harmonic I-forms on V. 
As usual, it is understood that the empty set is a manifold of any dimension 
-
this is not an existence theorem. 
Remark II.6.2. There are two main differences between this statement and Theo-
rem 11.3.8. The first one is that the moduli space here has finite dimension. The 
second one is that the condition "to be special Lagrangian" is no longer linear, 
so that this is indeed the tangent space that is identified to a space of differential 
forms. 
Example II.6.3. Let us come back to the example of the Calabi-Yau structure 
on T 52 described in § II.4.c. We have said in § II.5.d that the zero section is a 
special Lagrangian submanifold. As there are no non zero harmonic I-forms on 
52, the theorem of McLean asserts that the zero section is "rigid", that is, it 
cannot be deformed. In the moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds, this 
is an isolated point. 
Proof of Theorem IJ.6.1. 
Using the tubular neighbourhood theorem (here in §I1.3.b), replace M by a tubular 
neighbourhood of the submanifold V that is isomorphic to a neighbourhood of the 
zero section in the normal bundle of V (as are all tubular neighborhoods) and to a 
neighbourhood of the zero section in the cotangent T*V. We will use the structures 
induced by those of M on this neighbourhood, keeping their names, for example 
n = a + i/3. 

II. 6. Moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds 
71 
We have said in § II.3.c that the space of Lagrangian sub manifolds can be 
identified with a neighbourhood of 0 in the space Zl (V) of the closed I-forms 
on V. The special Lagrangian submanifolds are described, in this space, by the 
equation F(1]) = 0 where 
is the mapping defined by F(1]) = 1]*(3. Although these spaces are infinite dimen-
sional, the strategy of the proof is to show that F is submersive at O. It is thus 
better to restrict, as much as possible, its target space. Notice first: 
Lemma 11.6.4. The image of F is contained in the subspace dnn - 1 (V) of exact 
n-forms on V. 
Proof of Lemma II.6.4. If 1] is the zero form, the mapping 1] : V ----> T*V is the 
inclusion of the zero section, a special Lagrangian, thus F(O) = O. Given a form 1], 
it is possible to consider the path (segment) (t1])tE[O,lj joining it to the zero form ... 
and giving a homotopy from the section 1] to the zero section. The cohomology 
class of the closed form (t1])* (3 does not depend on t, thus it is identically zero, 
and that means, indeed, that 1]*(3 is an exact form. 
D 
We thus consider F as a mapping 
F: Zl(V) ~ 
dn n - 1(V) 
and compute its differential at O. 
Lemma 11.6.5. The differential of F at 0 is the mapping 
where * denotes the Hodge star operatoi' associated with the metric defined by the 
Calabi- Yau structure on the special Lagrangian V. 
Proof of Lemma II.6.5. To compute (dF)o(1]), one chooses a path of forms Tit 
whose tangent vector at 0 is the form 1]. Let 1] be a I-form on V and X be 
the vector field that corresponds to it via the metric on V, that is, the vector field 
such that g(X, .) = 1]. Let Y = J X be the vector field normal to V. This is the 
vector corresponding to 1] under the isomorphism NV c::: T* V. The vector field 
Y is only defined along V, we extend it (arbitrarily) in a vector~ field 17 on the 
tubular neighbourhood under consideration. Call ;Pt the flow of Y, so that ;Pt is 
a diffeomorphism defined for t small enough. The restriction CPt of ;Pt to V is an 
embedding of V into NV (one pushes V using CPt). For t = 0, this is the zero 
section. Hence for t small enough, this is still a section of NV. We have, for all x 
in V, 
d 
-cpt(x)lt-o = Y(x).

II. In symplectic and Calabi-Yau manifolds 
Under the identification NV c::: T*V, the section <Pt of NV corresponds to a section 
ift of T*V which is a path of forms, whose tangent vector at 0 is the form TJ. 
Consider now the (n, D)-form 0, still on our neighbourhood of the zero section 
in NV. We have 
:t <f5;Olt=o = 'cyO = dLyO 
applying Cartan formula together with the fact that 0 is closed. For the embedding 
<Pt : V -+ NV, we thus have 
:t <p;Olt=o = dLJXO = id(LXO) 
since 0 is C-linear. We then have 
(dF)o(TJ) = :t ifU3lt=o 
= Im(id(ixO)) 
= Red(ixO) 
= d(ixa). 
We still have to convince ourselves that ixa = *TJ. The (n ~ I)-form *TJ is the 
unique form satisfying 
'I/J 1\ (*TJ) = g('I/J, TJ)a 
for any I-form 'I/J. But, as the (n + I)-form 'I/J 1\ a is zero, its interior product by X 
is also zero and we have 
by definition of X and of the metric 9 on the space of I-forms. 
D 
Notice that this implies in particular that the differential dFo is onto: if cr is 
an (n ~ I)-form, 
dcr = (dFo)(± * cr). 
To end the proof of the theorem, we need to precise what kind of implicit func-
tion theorem we use to go from "differential is surjective" to "inverse image is a 
sub manifold" . The simplest here is to use the standard implicit function theorem 
for Banach spaces (see, for example, [10]). We need to endow the spaces of forms 
Zl (V) and on (V) with structures of Banach spaces. Let us precise the regularity 
of the forms we use. We consider forms of class C1,E in Zl (V) and of class CO,E 
in on(v). The Holder norm used here on forms is deduced from the usual Holder 
norm on functions: recall that Ck •E (U) is the space of functions of class Ck on the 
open set U of Rn all the derivatives (of order :::; k) of which have a finite Holder 
norm IluliE (for c EjO, 1]), with

The implicit function theorem gives the fact that F-1(0) is a submanifold in 
a neighbourhood of 0, whose tangent space at 0 is the kernel J(l(V) of (dF)o. It 
is important here that this kernel has finite dimension. The isomorphism between 
HiJR(V) and the space J(l (V) of harmonic I-forms is the contents in degree 1 of 
the Hodge theorem, see [15].

Remark 11.6.6. The vector space H"lJI/ (V) is isomorphic to the vector space dual 
to HiJR (V), so that 
has a natural symplectic structure (see Exercise 1.1), here 
w((a,1]),(a',r7')) = 1(a/\1]'-a' /\1]). 
The space of harmonic I-forms is a Lagrangian subspace, by

( a

(this is the graph of the mapping *, which is symmetric with respect to the metric ... 
see Exercise 1.8). If ]0 : V -+ W is a special Lagrangian submanifold, call 'B the 
moduli space in a neighbourhood of ]0. We thus have a Lagrangian subspace 
and it is possible to "integrate" it in a Lagrangian embedding (see [19]) 
See also [11] for a description of all these structures by symplectic reduction. 
11.7 
Towards mirror symmetry? 
The "mirror conjecture" asserts the existence, for any Calabi-Yau manifold M, of 
another Calabi-Yau manifold M* of the same dimension, related with M in a way 
we briefly describe now, sending the readers to [33] for missing detail. 
Call ]VhI the space of isomorphism classes of 
• a complex structure Jt deforming the complex structure J of M 
• a "complexified Kahler class" on (M, Jt ), namely a cohomology class of the 
form a + i(3, for some Kahler class (for Jt ) a E HJJR(M) and some element 
(3 E HJJR(M)/27rH2(M; Z). 

74 
II. In symplectic and Calabi- Yau manifolds 
Notice that, locally, Q + if3 varies in an open subset of H2(M; C), so that the 
space MM is, locally, a product. The manifold M and its "mirror" partner M* 
should be related by an isomorphism of the moduli spaces 
MM ------> MM* 
that exchanges the factors of this local decomposition as a product. 
Using in an essential way the symplectic structure of the loop space of M 
and techniques that go far beyond the level of these notes, Givental has proved 
the conjecture in [14], following a series of previous papers, the references of which 
can be found in [14] and [33]. 
Special Lagrangian submanifolds have been a few years ago the central object 
of another approach to mirror symmetry, more speculative and having given so far 
very few results -
but a very beautiful approach indeed, that I intend to describe 
very briefly here. 
II.7.a Fibrations in special Lagrangian submanifolds 
We are no more interested in a single special Lagrangian submanifold but in a 
whole family. More precisely, we consider a compact Calabi-Yau manifold M and 
a differential mapping 
p : M ------> B 
to a manifold B, whose general fibers are special Lagrangian submanifolds. The 
dimension of B, as that of the fibers of p, must be n. It is not required that p 
be everywhere regular. Some of the fibers may be singular. The other ones, who 
correspond to regular values of p, are called general fibers. 
We know (see § I.6.c and [4]) that in any proper Lagrangian fibration, the 
general fibers are unions of tori, so this must be the case here. The first Betti 
number of a torus of dimension n is precisely n, so that it can be expected that B 
"looks like" the moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds. 
So, let b E B be a regular value of p and let V c p-l(b) be a connected 
component of the fiber p-l(b). If X E TbB is a tangent vector, there exists a 
unique vector field Y normal to V in M and such that, for all x in V, 
To this field Y corresponds a harmonic I-form TJ on V, as in the proof of the 
theorem of McLean (here Theorem H.6.1). As B has dimension n, starting from 
n independent vectors Xl' ... ' Xn in nB, one constructs n fields Yl ,· .. , Yn, that 
are normal to V and linearly independent at each point of V. Dually, we thus 
have n harmonic I-forms TJl, ... ,TJn that form a basis of J(l (V) and are linearly 
independent at each point of V. 
In order that such a fibration p : M ---+ B exists in a neighbourhood of a 
special Lagrangian tors V c M, it is necessary that, for the metric induced by the 

II. 7. Towards mirror symmetry? 
75 
Calabi-Yau structure on V, there exists a basis of J{l (V) consisting of forms that 
are independent at each point of V. 
It is time to mention that (except in dimension 1) there is no known example 
having all the properties mentioned here. 
• Notice first that, abstractly, a basis of harmonic I-forms that are independent 
at each point exists on the flat torus, the basis dXl, ... , dX n having this 
property. The metrics that are close enough to the flat metric thus have the 
same property. 
• We have seen in § I1.5.c that the situation of a Calabi-Yau manifold foliated 
by special Lagrangians submanifolds occurs in dimension 1. 
• In dimension 2, on a special Lagrangian torus, one always has a basis of 
harmonic I-forms as expected. We have seen that a special Lagrangian sub-
manifold in dimension 2 is simply a complex curve (for a different complex 
structure). Assuming the submanifold is a torus, it must be an elliptic curve 
and it has a nowhere vanishing holomorphic form. Actually, the real and 
imaginary part of this form are harmonic forms on V and they are indepen-
dent at every point. 
11.7. b 
Mirror symmetry 
The Strominger, Yau and Zaslow approach to mirror symmetry [32] is to associate, 
to a Calabi-Yau manifold M endowed with a fibration in special Lagrangian tori 
(assuming it exists), another Calabi-Yau manifold M*. The latter should be the 
"extended" moduli space of special Lagrangian submanifolds of M equipped with 
a flat unitary line bundle. Call, as above, 'B the moduli space of special Lagrangian 
submanifolds in the neighbourhood of V. Locally, the extended moduli space is 
M* = 'B X HI (V; R/Z). 
Its tangent space at a point m is 
Thus, M* has a natural almost complex structure, it is even Kahler: 
Theorem II.7.1 (Hitchin [19]). The complex structure on M* is integrable, the 
metric of Hl (V; R) defines a Kahler metric on M*. 
We have seen (Remark 11.6.6 above) that 'B is a Lagrangian submanifold 
of HiJR(V) EEl H7YRl(V), a symplectic vector space endowed by the metric of an 
almost complex structure (see Exercise 1.12). It can be shown (see [19]) that M* is 
a Calabi-Yau manifold if 'B is ... a special Lagrangian submanifold in this complex 
vector space. See [11, 20].

Symplectic Toric Manifolds 
Ana Cannas da Silva 

Foreword 
The goal of this text is to provide a fast elementary introduction to toric manifolds 
(i.e., smooth toric varieties) from the symplectic viewpoint. The study of toric 
manifolds has many different entrances and has been scoring a wide spectrum 
of applications. For symplectic geometers, they provide examples of extremely 
symmetric and completely integrable hamiltonian spaces. In order to distinguish 
the algebraic from the symplectic approach, we call algebraic tonc manifolds to the 
smooth toric varieties in algebraic geometry, and say symplectic tonc manifolds 
when studying their symplectic properties. 
Native to algebraic geometry, the theory oftoric varieties has been around for 
about thirty years. It was introduced by Demazure in [16] who used toric varieties 
for classifying some algebraic subgroups. Since 1970 many nice surveys of the 
theory oftoric varieties have appeared (see, for instance, [14,21,28,41]). Algebraic 
geometers and combinatorialists have found fruitful applications of toric varieties 
to the geometry of convex polytopes, resolutions of singularities, compactifications 
of locally symmetric spaces, critical points of analytic functions, etc. For the last 
ten years, toric geometry became an important tool in physics in connection with 
mirror symmetry [13] where research has been intensive. 
In this text we emphasize the geometry of the moment map whose image, the 
so-called moment polytope, determines the symplectic toric manifolds. The notion 
of a moment map associated to a group action generalizes that of a hamiltonian 
function associated to a vector field. Either of these notions formalizes the Noether 
principle, which states that to every symmetry (such as a group action) in a me-
chanical system, there corresponds a conserved quantity. The concept of a moment 
map was introduced by Souriau [45] under the french name application moment; 
besides the more standard english translation to moment map, the alternative mo-
mentum map is also used. Moment maps have been asserting themselves as a main 
tool to study problems in geometry and topology when there is a suitable sym-
metry, as illustrated in the book by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky [22]. The 
material in some sections of the second part of these notes borrows largely from 
that excellent text, where details are given and where the discussion continues in 
exciting new directions. 
This course splits into two parts: the first concentrates on the symplectic view-
point, and the second focuses on the algebraic viewpoint with links to symplectic 
geometry. Each of the two parts has a similar structure: introduction, classifica-
tion, polytopes. So the lectures seem periodic though the languages for each half 
are noticeably different. 
After introducing, in the first lecture, basic notions related to symplectic 
toric manifolds, in Lecture 2 we state their classification, and prove the existence 
part of the classification theorem by using the technique of symplectic reduction. 
Lecture 3 discusses moment polytopes, namely how to read from the polytope 
some topological properties of the corresponding symplectic toric manifolds, as 
well as how are some changes on the polytopes translated into changes of the cor-

Foreword 
responding symplectic toric manifolds. Lecture 4 introduces toric manifolds from 
the algebro-geometric perspective, after reviewing definitions and notation in the 
theory of algebraic varieties. Lecture 5 describes the classification of toric varieties 
using the language of spectra and fans. Finally, Lecture 6 deals with polytopes 
now from the algebraic point of view, studying some geometric properties of toric 
varieties which polytopes encode. Lectures 3 and 6 underline the moment map 
potential. 
Geometry of manifolds at the level of a first-year graduate course is the basic 
prerequisite for this course. Some familiarity with symplectic geometry is useful 
to read these notes faster, though most of the needed definitions and results are 
stated here. Scattered through the text, there are exercises designed to complement 
the exposition or extend the reader's understanding. Throughout, the symbol ]pm 
denotes n-( complex-) dimensional complex projective space. 

Chapter I 
Symplectic Viewpoint 
1.1 
Symplectic Toric Manifolds 
In order to define symplectic toric manifolds, we begin by introducing the basic 
objects in symplectic/hamiltonian geometry/mechanics which lead to their con-
sideration. Our discussion centers around moment maps. 
1.1.1 
Symplectic Manifolds 
Definition 1.1.1. A symplectic form on a manifold M is a closed 2-form on Iv! 
which is nondegenerate at every point of M. A symplectic manifold lS a palr 
(M,w) where M is a manifold and w is a symplectic form on M. 
By linear algebra, a symplectic manifold is necessarily even-dimensional. 
Examples. 
1. Let M = ]R2n with linear coordinates Xl, . .. ,X"' YI , ... , Yn. The standard 
symplectic form on ]R2n is 
" 
Wo = Ldxk I\dYk 
k=l 
2. Let M = en with linear coordinates ZI, ... , Zn. The form 
. " 
Wo = ~ L 
dZk 1\ dZk 
k=1 
is a symplectic form on C'. In fact, this form equals that of the previous 
example under the identification en ~ ]R2n, Zk = Xk + iYk. 

90 
I. Symplectic Viewpoint 
3. Let M = S2 regarded as the set of unit vectors in JR3. Tangent vectors to 
S2 at p may then be identified with vectors orthogonal to p. The standard 
symplectic form on S2 is the form induced by the inner and exterior products: 
Wp(u,v):= (p,u x v) , 
This form is closed because it is of top degree; it is nondegenerate because 
(p, u x v) =I- 0 when u =I- 0 and we take, for instance, v = u x p. 
Exercise 1 
Check that, in cylindrical coordinates away from the poles (0 :s; 0 < 211" and 
-1 < h < 1), the standard symplectic form on 52 is the area form given by 
W,tanda,d = dO /\ dh . 
The natural notion of equivalence in the symplectic category is expressed by 
a symplectomorphism: 
Definition 1.1.2. Let (Ml' Wj) and (M2' W2) be 2n-dimensional symplectic mani-
folds, and let cp : Ml -+ M2 be a diffeomorphism. Then cp is a symplectomorphism 
if CP*W2 = Wl· 
The Darboux theorem (see, for instance, [12] or Theorem 1.3.1 for the case 
where the group is trivial) states that any symplectic manifold (M 2n, w) is locally 
symplectomorphic to (JR2n, wo). In other words, the prototype of a local piece of 
a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold is (JR2n,wo). Hence, this theorem provides 
the local classification of symplectic manifolds in terms of a unique invariant: the 
dimension. 
Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold of dimension 2n. A Darboux chart for 
M is a chart (U, Xl , ... , X n, Yl, ... , Yn) such that 
n 
wlu = L dXk /\ dYk 
k=l 
By the Darboux theorem, there exists a Darboux chart centered at each point of 
a symplectic manifold. 
1.1.2 
Hamiltonian Vector Fields 
Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold. 
Definition 1.1.3. A vector field X on M is symplectic if the contraction lXW lS 
closed. A vector field X on M is hamiltonian if the contraction lXW is exact. 

I.l. Symplectic Toric Manifolds 
91 
Locally on every contractible open set, every symplectic vector field is hamil-
tonian. If the first de Rham cohomology group is trivial, then globally every sym-
plectic vector field is hamiltonian; in general, HdeRham (M) measures the obstruc-
tion for symplectic vector fields to be hamiltonian. 
Note that the flow of a symplectic vector field X preserves the symplectic 
form: 
Lxw = d zxw +zx dw = 0 . 
'-.,.-' 
'-.,.-' 
closed 
() 
If a vector field X is hamiltonian with zxw = dH for some smooth function 
H : M --+ lR, then the flow of X also preserves the function H: 
Lx H = zxdH = Zx zxw = 0 . 
Therefore, each integral curve {Pt(x) I t E lR} of X must be contained in a level 
set of H: 
H(x) = (p;H)(x) = H(pt(x)) , 
'1ft. 
Definition 1.1.4. A hamiltonian function for a hamiltonian vector field X on M is 
a smooth function H : M --+ lR such that zxw = dH. 
By nondegeneracy of w, any function H E COC(M) is a hamiltonian func-
tion for some hamiltonian vector field because the equation zxw = dH can be 
always solved for a smooth vector field X. A hamiltonian vector field X defines a 
hamiltonian function up to a locally constant function. 
Examples. 
1. On the standard symplectic 2-sphere (52, de /\ dh), the vector field X = !}II 
is hamiltonian with hamiltonian function given by the height function: 
z x (de /\ dh) = dh . 
The motion generated by this vector field is rotation about the vertical axis, 
which of course preserves both area and height. 
2. On the symplectic 2-torus (1['2, del /\ de2 ), the vector fields Xl 
X 2 = 
[)~2 are symplectic but not hamiltonian. 
1.1.3 
Integrable Systems 
[)~, and 
Let X H denote a hamiltonian vector field on a symplectic manifold (M, w) with 
hamiltonian function H E C=(M).

Definition 1.1.5. The Poisson bracket of two functions j,g E C=(M) is the func-
tion 
{j,g} := w(Xj,Xg) . 
We have XU,g} = -[Xj, Xg] because Xw(Xj,Xq ) 
the Lie bracket of vector fields. 1

Check that the Poisson bracket L·} is a Lie bracket and satisfies the Leibniz 
rule: 
{f,gh} = {f,g}h+g{f,h} 
\/f,g,h E COO(M) . 
Therefore, if (M,w) is a symplectic manifold, then (C=(M), L·}) is a Pois-
son algebra, that is a Lie algebra with an associative product for which the Leibniz 
rule holds. Furthermore, we have an anti-homomorphism of Lie algebras

Definition 1.1.6. A hamiltonian system is a triple (M, w, H), where (M, w) zs a 
symplectic manifold and H E CDO(M) is a function, called the hamiltonian func-
tion. 
Exercise 3 
Show that {f, H} = 0 if and only if f is constant along integral curves of X H' 
A function j as in the previous exercise is called an integral of motion (or a 
first integral or a constant of motion) for the hamiltonian system (M, w, H). 
In general, hamiltonian systems do not admit integrals of motion which are 
independent of the hamiltonian function. Functions h, ... , f n on M are said to 
be independent if their differentials (dh)p," ., (djn)p are linearly independent at 
all points p in some open dense subset of M. Loosely speaking, a hamiltonian 
system is (completely) integrable if it has as many commuting integrals of motion 
as possible. Commutativity is with respect to the Poisson bracket. Notice that, if 
h, ... , j n are commuting integrals of motion for a hamiltonian system (M, w, H), 
then, at each p E M, their hamiltonian vector fields generate an isotropic subspace 
ofTpM: 
w(Xj"XjJ) = {fi,jj} = O. 
If h, ... , fn are independent at p, then, by symplectic linear algebra, n can be at 
most half the dimension of M. 
IThe Lie bracket of two vector fields is their commutator, where they are regarded as first-
order differential operators. A bilinear function L·} : C=(M) x C=(M) ---+ COO(M) is a Lie 
bracket if it is antisymmetric, i.e., {f,g} = -{g,!}, \/f,g E COO(M), and satisfies the Jacobi 
identity: 
{f, {g, h}} + {g, {h,!}} + {h, {f,g}} = 0 
\/ f, g, hE C OO (!v1) .

Definition 1.1.7. A hamiltonian system (M,w,H) is (completely) integrable if it 
admits n = 
~ dim M independent integrals of motion, h = H, 12,·· ., fn, which 
are pairwise in involution with respect to the Poisson bracket, i. e., {Ii, fj} = 0, 
for all i,j. 
Example. A hamiltonian system (M, w, H) where M is 4-dimensional is integrable 
if there is an integral of motion independent of H (the commutativity condition 
is automatically satisfied). 
0 
For interesting examples of integrable systems, see [7]. 
Let (M, w, H) be an integrable system of dimension 2n with integrals of 
motion h = H, 12, ... , fn· Let c E rn;.n be a regular value of f := (h,···, fn). The 
corresponding level set, f-1(C), is a lagrangian submanifold. A sub manifold Y of 
a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M, w) is lagrangian if it is n-dimensional 
and if i*w = 0 where i : Y '---+ M is the inclusion map. 
Exercise 4 
By following the flows, show that if the hamiltonian vector fields X h , ... , X In. 
are complete on the level f-l(c) (i.e., if their flows are defined for all time), 
the connected components of f-I(c) are homogeneous spaces for IFF', i.e., are 
of the form 1R71 - k X ']]'k for some 0 <::: k <::: n, where ']]'k is a k-dimensional torus. 
Any compact component of f-1(C) must hence be a torus. These compact 
components, when they exist, are called Liouville tori. 
Theorem 1.1.8. (Arnold-Liouville [2]) 
Let (M, w, H) be an integrable system 
of dimension 2n with integrals of motion h = H, 12, ... , fn. Let c E rn;.n be a 
regular value of f := (h, ... ,fn). The corresponding level f- 1 (c) is a lagrangian 
submanifold of M. 
(a) If the flows of X II, ... ,X In starting at a point p E f- 1 (c) are complete, then 
the connected component of f-1(C) containing p is a homogeneous space for 
rn;.n. Namely, there is an affine structure on that component with coordinates 
'P1, ... ,'Pn, known as angle coordinates, in which the flows of the vector 
fields X II , ... , X In are linear. 
(b) There are coordinates 7/J1 , ... , 7/J", known as action coordinates, complemen-
tary to the angle coordinates such that the 7/Ji'S are integrals of motion and 
'P1, ... , 'Pn, 7/J1, ... ,7/Jn form a Darboux chart. 
Therefore, the dynamics of an integrable system is extremely simple and the 
system has an explicit solution in action-angle coordinates. The proof of part (a) -
the easy, yet interesting, part - of the Arnold-Liouville theorem is sketched above. 
For the proof of part (b), see [2, 17]. 
Geometrically, part (a) of the Arnold-Liouville theorem says that, in a neigh-
borhood of the value c, the map f : M ----> rn;.n collecting the given integrals of 

94 
I. Symplectic Viewpoint 
motion is a lagrangian fibration, i.e., it is locally trivial and its fibers are la-
grangian submanifolds. The coordinates along the fibers are the angle coordi-
nates. 2 Part (b) of the theorem guarantees the existence of coordinates on JR.n, the 
action coordinates, which (Poisson) commute among themselves and which satisfy 
{'Pi, 'l/Jj} = bij with respect to the angle coordinates. Notice that, in general, the ac-
tion coordinates are not the given integrals of motion because 'PI, ... , 'Pn, II, ... , f n 
do not form a Darboux chart. 
1.1.4 Hamiltonian Actions 
Definition 1.1.9. An action of a Lie group G on a manifold M is a group homo-
morphism 
'l/J: 
G 
---t Diff(M) 
g 
f------+ 
'l/Jg, 
where Diff(M) is the group of diffeomorphisms of M. The evaluation map associ-
ated with an action 'l/J : G ---+ Diff(M) is 
ev'lj! : MxG 
(p,g) 
The action 'l/J is smooth if ev'lj! is a smooth map. 
We will always assume that an action is smooth. 
Example. Complete vector fields3 on a manifold M are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with actions of JR. on M. The diffeomorphism 'l/Jt : M ---+ M associated to 
t E JR. is the time-t map exp tX defined by the flow of the vector field X. 
<) 
Let (M,w) be a symplectic manifold, and G a Lie group with an action 
'l/J : G ---+ Diff(M). 
Definition 1.1.10. The action 'l/J is a symplectic action if it is by symplectomor-
phisms, i.e., 
'l/J: G ---t Sympl(M,w) c Diff(M) , 
where Sympl( M, w) is the group of symplectomorphisms of (M, w). 
Examples. 
1. On the symplectic 2-sphere (82 , dB 1\ dh) in cylindrical coordinates, the one-
parameter group of diffeomorphisms given by rotation around the vertical 
axis, 'l/Jt(B, h) = (B + t, h) (t E JR.) is a symplectic action of the group 8 1 ~ 
JR./ (21T), as it preserves the area form dB 1\ dh. 
2The name angle coordinates is used even if the fibers are not tori. 
3 A vector field is complete if its integral curves through each point exist for all time. 

1.1. Symplectic Toric Manifolds 
95 
2. On the symplectic 2-torus (']['2, d(h II d(h), the one-parameter groups of dif-
feomorphisms given by rotation around each circle, 'ljJ1.t((h'(h) = (0 1 +t,02) 
(t E IR) and 'ljJ2,t similarly defined, are symplectic actions of 8 1 . 
Let (M,w) be a symplectic manifold, G a Lie group with an action 'ljJ : G ~ 
Diff(M) , and 9 the Lie algebra of G with dual vector space g*. 
Definition 1.1.11. The action'ljJ is a hamiltonian action if there exists a map 
J-L:M~g* 
satisfying the following two conditions: 
• For each X E g, let J-Lx : M ~ IR, J-Lx (p) := (J-L(p) , X), be the component of J-L 
along X, and let X# be the vector field on M generated by the one-parameter 
subgroup {exp tX I t E IR} <:;; G. Then 
dJ-Lx = ~x#w 
i. e., the function J-Lx is a hamiltonian function for the vector field X#. 
• The map J-L is equivariant with respect to the given action 'ljJ of G on M and 
the coadjoint action Ad* of G on g*: 
for all g E G . 
The vector (M, w, G, J-L) is then called a hamiltonian G-space and J-L is called a 
moment map. 
Exercise 5 
Check that complete symplectic vector fields on M are in one-to-one corre-
spondence with symplectic actions of IR on M, and that, similarly, complete 
hamiltonian vector fields on M are in one-to-one correspondence with hamil-
tonian actions of IR on M. 
Examples. Consider the previous set of two examples (as well as in the examples of 
Section 1.1.2). The first - regarding 8 2 - is an example of a hamiltonian action of 
8 1 with moment map given by the height function, under a suitable identification 
of the dual of the Lie algebra of 8 1 with R The second example - regarding T2 -
is not hamiltonian since the one-forms dOl and d02 are not exact. 
<> 
Exercise 6 
Let G be any compact Lie group and H a closed subgroup of G, with 9 and ~ 
the respective Lie algebras. The projection i* : g* -> ~* is the map dual to the 
inclusion i: ~ <-> g. Suppose that (M,w,G,</» is a hamiltonian G-space. Show 
that the restriction of the G-action to H is hamiltonian with moment map 
i* 0 </> : M ---t ~* . 

96 
I. Symplectic Viewpoint 
Exercise 7 
Suppose that a Lie group G acts in a hamiltonian way on two symplectic 
manifolds (Mj, wJ ), j = 1,2, with moment maps fLJ : Mj -> g*. The product 
manifold MI X M2 has a natural product symplectic structure given by the sum 
of the pull-backs of the symplectic forms on each factor, via the two projections. 
Prove that the diagonal action of G on MI X M2 is hamiltonian with moment 
map fL : MI X M2 -> g* given by 
From now on, we concentrate on actions of a torus G = ']['m = IRm /zm. 
1.1.5 
Hamiltonian Torus Actions 
The coadjoint action is trivial on a torus (a product of circles Sl x·· . X Sl). Hence, 
if G = ']['n is an n-dimensional torus with Lie algebra and its dual both identified 
with euclidean space, 9 c:::: IRn and g* c:::: IRn, a moment map for an action of G on 
(M, w) is simply a map IL : M ----7 IRn satisfying: 
• For each basis vector Xi of IRn, the function ILK, is a hamiltonian function 
for xt and is invariant under the action of the torus. 
If IL : M ---+ IRn is a moment map for a torus action, then clearly any of its 
translations IL + c (c E IRn) is also a moment map for that action. Reciprocally, 
any two moment maps for a given hamiltonian torus action differ by a constant. 
Example. On (C, Wo = ~ dz ;\ d2), consider the action of the circle 51 = {t E C : 
I t I = 1} by rotations

Theorem 1.1.12. (Atiyah [3], Guillemin-Sternberg [25]) 
Let (M,w) be a compact 
connected symplectic manifold, and let ']['m be an m-torus. Suppose that 'ljJ : ']['m -+ 
Sympl( M, w) is a hamiltonian action with moment map f.1 : M -+ IRm. Then: 
(a) the levels of f.1 are connected; 
(b) the image of f.1 is convex; 
(c) the image of f.1 is the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of the 
action. 
The image f.1(M) of the moment map is called the moment polytope. A proof 
of Theorem 1.1.12 can be found in [36]. 
An action of a group G on a manifold M is called effective if it is injective 
as a map G -+ Diff(M), i.e., each group element 9 -I=- e moves at least one point, 
that is, npEMGp = {e}, where Gp = {g E Gig· p = p} is the stabilizer of p.

way, then any moment map f-t is a submersion, i.e., each differential 
df-tv : en ---> IRn (v E en) is surjective. 
aNotice that the standard inner product satisfies (v, w) = wo(v, Jv) where 
J !1z = i !1z and J !1. = -i !1 •. In particular, the standard norm is invariant for 
a symplectic complex-linear action. 
The following two results use the crucial fact that any effective action ']['m -+ 
Diff(M) has orbits of dimension m; a proof may be found in [10].

I. Symplectic Viewpoint 
Corollary 1.1.13. Under the conditions of the convexity theorem, if the ']['m-action 
is effective, then there must be at least m + 1 fixed points. 
Proof. At a point p of an m-dimensional orbit the moment map is a submersion, 
i.e., (dJ-ldp,' .. ,(dJ-lm)p are linearly independent. Hence, J-l(p) is an interior point of 
J-l(M), and J-l(M) is a nondegenerate convex polytope. Any nondegenerate convex 
polytope in IRm must have at least m + 1 vertices. The vertices of J-l( M) are images 
of fixed points.

Theorem 1.1.14. Let (M,w, ,][,m,J-l) be a hamiltonian ']['m-space. If the ']['m-action 
is effective, then dim M 2: 2m. 
Proof. Since the moment map is constant on an orbit 0, for p E 0 the exterior 
derivative 
maps TpO to O. Thus 
TpO <;;; ker dJ-lp = (TpO)W , 
where (TpO)W is the symplectic orthogonal of TpO. This shows that orbits 0 of 
a hamiltonian torus action are always isotropic submanifolds of M. In particular, 
by symplectic linear algebra we have that dim 0

~ dim M. Now consider an

Classification 
Recall that a 2n-dimensional symplectic toric manifold is a compact connected 
symplectic manifold (M 2n , w) equipped with an effective hamiltonian action of an 
n-torus 1fn and with a corresponding moment map f-L : M -+ ]Rn. In this lecture 
we describe the classification of equivalence classes of symplectic toric manifolds 
by their moment polytopes f-L(M). Symplectic reduction is the quotienting tech-
nique which we use for the construction of a symplectic toric manifold out of an 
appropriate polytope, thus proving the existence part in the classification theorem. 
1.2.1 
Delzant's Theorem 
We now define the class of polytopes4 which arise in the classification of symplectic 
toric manifolds. 
Definition I.2.1. A Delzant polytope ~ in ]Rn is a polytope satisfying: 
• simplicity, i. e., there are n edges meeting at each vertex; 
• rationality, i. e., the edges meeting at the vertex p are rational in the sense 
that each edge is of the form p + tUi, t ~ 0, where u, E Z/'; 
• smoothness, i.e., for each vertex, the corresponding Uj, ... , Un can be chosen 
to be a Z-basis of zn. 
Examples of Delzant polytopes in ]R2: 
The dotted vertical line in the trapezoidal example is there just to stress that it is a 
picture of a rectangle plus an isosceles triangle. For "taller" triangles, smoothness 
would be violated. "Wider" triangles (with integral slope) may still be Delzant. 
The family of the Delzant trapezoids of this type, starting with the rectangle, 
correspond, under the Delzant construction, to Hirzebruch surfaces; see Lecture 3. 
<) 
4 A polytope in IRn is the convex hull of a finite number of points in IRn. A convex polyhedron is 
a subset of IRn which is the intersection of a finite number of affine half-spaces. Hence, polytopes 
coincide with bounded convex polyhedra. 

102 
1. Symplectic Viewpoint 
Examples of polytopes which are not Delzant: 
The picture on the left fails the smoothness condition, since the triangle is not 
isosceles, whereas the one on the right fails the simplicity condition.

Delzant's theorem classifies (equivalence classes of) symplectic toric mani-
folds in terms of the combinatorial data encoded by a Delzant polytope.

tence part, or surjectivity, in Delzant's theorem. In order to prepare that, we will 
next give an algebraic description of Delzant polytopes. 
Let 6. be a Delzant polytope in (lFF')*5 and with d facets. 6 Let Vi E Z", 
i = 1, ... ,d, be the primitive? outward-pointing normal vectors to the facets of 6.. 
Then we can describe 6. as an intersection of halfspaces 
6. = {x E (IR")* I (x, Vi) :s; Ai, i = 1, ... , d} 
for some Ai E IR . 
Example. For the picture on the next page, we have 
6. 
{x E (1R2)* I Xl 2: 0, x2 2: 0, Xl + X2 :s; I} 
{x E (1R2)* I (x, (-1,0) :s; 0 , (x, (0, -1) :s; 0 , (x, (1, 1) :s; I} 
5 Although we identify R" with its dual via the euclidean inner product, it may be more clear 
to see II in (R")* for Delzant's construction. 
fiA face of a polytope II is a set of the form P = P n {x E lEI.n j f(x) = c} where c E lEI. 
and f E (lEI.n)* satisfies f(x) 2> c, \Ix E P. A facet of an n-dimensional polytope is an (n - 1)-
dimensional face. 
7 A lattice vector v E zn is primitive if it cannot be written as v = ku with u E Z", k E Z and 
jkj > 1; for instance, (1,1), (4,3), (1,0) are primitive, but (2,2), (4,6) are not.

Orbit Spaces 
Let 1/J : G -+ Diff(M) be any action. 
Definition 1.2.3. The orbit of G through P E M is {1/Jg(p) I g E G}. The stabilizer 
(or isotropy) ofp EM is Gp := {g E G l1/Jg (p) = p}. 
Exercise 13 
If q is in the orbit of p, then G q and Gl' are conjugate subgroups. 
Definition 1.2.4. We say that the action of G on Mis: 
• transitive if there is just one orbit, 
• free if all stabilizers are trivial {e}, 
• locally free if all stabilizers are discrete. 
Let rv be the orbit equivalence relation; for p, q E M, 
p rv q 
¢=} 
P and q are on the same orbit.

We equip MIG with the weakest topology for which 7f is continuous, i.e., 
U <;;; MIG is open if and only if 7f- 1 (U) is open in M. This is called the quotient 
topology. This topology can be "bad." For instance:

The orbits are the punctured complex lines (through non-zero vectors z E en), 
plus one "unstable" orbit through 0, which has a single point. The orbit space is 
MIG = jp'n-1 U {point} . 
The quotient topology restricts to the usual topology on jp'n-1. The only open set 
containing {point} in the quotient topology is the full space, hence the topology 
in MIG is not Hausdorff. 
However, it suffices to remove 0 from en to obtain a Hausdorff orbit space: 
jp'n-1. Then there is also a compact (yet not complex) description of the orbit 
space by taking only unit vectors under the action of the circle subgroup:

tonian G-space for a compact Lie group G. Let i : f.l~1(0) '---+ M be the inclusion 
map. Assume that G acts freely on f.l~1(0). Then

(b) 7r: f.l~1(0) ---+ Mred is a principal G-bundle, and

For a proof of Theorem I.2.5, see for instance [12]. 
Definition 1.2.6. The pair (Mred , Wred) is called the symplectic reduction of (M, W) 
with respect to G and f.l (or the reduced space, or the symplectic quotient, or the 
Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer quotient, etc'). 
Remark. When M is Kahler, i.e., has a compatible complex structure, and the 
action of G preserves the complex structure, then the symplectic reduction has a 
natural Kahler structure.

1.2.4 Extensions of Symplectic Reduction 
We consider three basic extensions of the procedure of symplectic reduction. 
1. Reduction for product groups. 
Let G 1 and G2 be compact connected Lie groups and let G = G1 X G2 . Then 
9 c::::' g1 EBg2 and g* c::::' g~ EBg~. Suppose that (M,w,G,v) is a hamiltonian 
G-space with moment map 
Write v = (VI, V2) where Vi : M 
----> g; for i = 1,2. The fact that V is 
equivariant implies that VI is invariant under G2 and V2 is invariant under 
G I. Now reduce (M, w) with respect to the G1-action. Let 
Assume that GI acts freely on Zl' Let MI = ZI/GI be the reduced space 
and let WI be the corresponding reduced symplectic form. The action of 
G2 on ZI commutes with the G I-action. Since G 2 preserves w, it follows 
that G2 acts symplectically on (MI,wd. Since GI preserves V2, G 1 also 
preserves V2 0 ~I : ZI ----> g2, where ~l : Zl '--> M is inclusion. Thus V2 0 ~I is 
constant on fibers of ZI ~ MI. We conclude that there exists a smooth map 
/-l'2 : MI ----> g~ such that /-l2 0 PI = V2 0 ~l' 
Exercise 15 
Show that: 
(a) the map J.L2 is a moment map for the action of G2 on (M],wd, and 
(b) if G acts freely on v- 1(0,0), then G 2 acts freely on J.L2 1 (0), and there 
is a natural symplectomorphism 
This technique of performing reduction with respect to one factor of a prod-
uct group at a time is called reduction in stages. It may be extended to 
reduction by a normal subgroup H c G and by the corresponding quotient 
group G/H. 
2. Reduction at other levels. 
Suppose that a compact Lie group G acts on a symplectic manifold (M, w) 
in a hamiltonian way with moment map /-l : M 
----> g*. Let ~ E g*. To 
reduce at the level ~ of /-l, we need /-l-l (0 to be preserved by G, or else take 
the G-orbit of /-l-l(~), or equivalently take the inverse image /-l-I(Od of the 
coadjoint orbit through~, or else take the quotient by the maximal subgroup

of G which preserves fL -1 (0. Of course the level 0 is always preserved. Also, 
when G is a torus, any level is preserved and reduction at ~ for the moment 
map fL, is equivalent to reduction at 0 for a shifted moment map ¢ : M ---+ g*, 
¢(p) := fL(P) -~. 
3. Orb if old singularities. 
Roughly speaking, orbifolds (introduced by Satake in [42]) are singular mani-
folds where each singularity is locally modeled on IR.m If, for some finite group 
f C GL(m;IR.). For the precise definition, let IMI be a Hausdorff topological 
space satisfying the second axiom of countability. 
Definition 1.2.7. An orbifold chart on 1M I is a triple (V, f, cp), where V is a 
connected open subset of some euclidean space IR.m, f is a finite group which 
acts linearly on V so that the set of points where the action is not free has 
codimension at least two, and cp : V ---+ IMI is a f -invariant map inducing 
a homeomorphism from V If onto its image U C IMI. An orbifold atlas A 
for IMI is a collection of orbifold charts on IMI such that: the collection of 
images U forms a basis of open sets in IMI, and the charts are compatible in 
the sense that, whenever two charts (VI, f 1, CPI) and (V2' f 2, CP2) satisfy U j c: 
U2 , there exists an injective homomorphism A: fl ---+ f2 and a A-equivariant 
open embedding 1j; : V j ---+ V2 such that CP2 o1j; = CPl. Two orbifold atlases are 
equivalent if their union is still an atlas. An m-dimensional orbifold M is a 
Hausdorff topological space IMI satisfying the second axiom of countability, 
plus an equivalence class of orbifold atlases on IMI. 
Notice that we do not require the action of each group f to be effective. 
Given a point p on an orbifold M, let (V, f, cp) be an orbifold chart for a 
neighborhood U of p. The orbifold structure group of p, fp, is (the isomor-
phism class of) the isotropy group of a pre-image of p under ¢. We may 
always choose an orbifold chart (V,f,cp) such that cp-I(p) is a single point 
(which is fixed by f). In this case f 
c:::: fp, and we say that (V,f,cp) is a 
structure chart for p. 
An ordinary manifold is a special case of orbifold where each group f is the 
identity group. Quotients of manifolds by locally free actions of Lie groups 
are orbifolds. In fact, any orbifold M has a presentation of this form obtained 
as follows. Given a structure chart (V,f,cp) for p E M with image U, the 
orbifold tangent space at p is the quotient of the tangent space to V at 
cp-I(p) by the induced action of f: 
The collection of the orbifold tangent spaces at all p, builds up the orbifold 
tangent bundle T M, which has a natural structure of smooth manifold out-
side the zero section. The general linear group GL(m; IR.) acts locally freely

on TM \ 0, and M "'::' (TM - O)/GL(m;IR). Choosing a riemannian met-
ric and taking the orthonormal frame bundle, O(T M), we present M as 
O(TM)/O(m). 
Example. Let G = 1fT' be an n-torus acting on a symplectic manifold (M,w) 
in a hamiltonian way with moment map /1 : M 
---+ g*. For any ~ E g*, 
the level /1-1(~) is preserved by the ']['n-action. Suppose that ~ is a regular 
value of /1.8 Then /1-1 (0 is a submanifold of codimension n. Let Gp be the 
stabilizer of p, and gp its Lie algebra. Note that 
~ regular

d/1p is surjective at all p E /1-1 (0 
¢==} 
gp = 0 for all p E /1-1 (0 
¢==} 
the stabilizers on /1-1(0 are finite. 
By the slice theorem (see, for instance, [6, 12]), near Gp the orbit space 
/1-1 (O/G is modeled by S/Gp , where 5 is a Gp-invariant disk in Il- l (O 
through p and transverse to Gp . Hence, /1-1(0/G is an orbifold. 
<) 
Example. Consider the 5 1-action on ((:2 by eie . (ZI,Z2) = (eikOzl,eiliz2) for 
some fixed integer k ::;. 2. This is hamiltonian with moment map

conehead; it has one cone (also known as a dunce cap) singularity with cone 
angle 2;;, that is, a point with orbifold structure group Zk.

Example. Let 51 act on ((:2 by eie . (ZI , Z2) = (eikO Z1, eifli Z2) for some integers

The differential-geometric notions of vector fields, differential forms, exterior 
differentiation, group actions, etc., extend naturally to orbifolds by gluing 
corresponding local f-invariant or f-equivariant objects. In particular, a 
symplectic orbifold is a pair (M, w) where M is an orbifold and w is a closed 
2-form on M which is nondegenerate at every point of M. 
Definition 1.2.8. A symplectic toric orbifold is a compact connected symplec-
tic orbifold (M, w) equipped with an effective hamiltonian action of a torus 
'][' of dimension equal to half the dimension of the orbifold, 
1 
dim'][' = "2 dim M , 
and with a choice of a corresponding moment map /1. 
Symplectic toric orbifolds have been classified by Lerman and Tolman [33] 
in a theorem which generalizes Delzant's theorem: a symplectic toric orb-
ifold is determined by its moment polytope plus a positive integer label 
attached to each of the polytope facets. The polytopes which occur in the 
Lerman-Tolman classification are more general than the Delzant polytopes 
in the sense that only simplicity and rationality are required; the edge vec-
tors Uj, ... , u" need only form a rational basis of zn. In the case where the 
integer labels are all equal to 1, the failure of the polytope smoothness ac-
counts for all orbifold singularities. Throughout the rest of these notes, we 
concentrate on the manifold case. 
1.2.5 
Delzant's Construction 
Following [15, 24], we prove the existence part (or surjectivity) in Delzant's the-
orem, by using symplectic reduction to associate to an n-dimensional Delzant 
polytope.6. a symplectic toric manifold (M£;.,w£;., ']['n,/1£;.). 
Let .6. be a Delzant polytope with d facets. Let Vi E zn, i = 1, ... , d, be the 
primitive outward-pointing normal vectors to the facets. For some Ai E JR!., we can 
write 
.6. = {x E (JR!.n)* I (X,Vi) s:; Ai, i = 1, ... ,d} . 
Let el = (1,0, ... ,0), ... , ed = (0, ... ,0,1) be the standard basis of JR!.d. Consider

Lemma 1.2.9. The map 1f is onto and maps 7Ld onto 7Ln. 
Proof. The set {el' ... , ed} is a basis of 7Ld. The set {VI, ... ,Vd} spans 7Ln for the 
following reason. At a vertex p, the edge vectors Ul, ... ,Un E (JR'.n)*, form a basis 
for (7Ln)* which, by a change of basis if necessary, we may assume is the standard 
basis. Then the corresponding primitive normal vectors to the facets meeting at 
p are symmetric (in the sense of multiplication by -1) to the Ui'S, hence form a 
basis of 7Ln. 
D 
Therefore, 1f induces a surjective map, still called 1f, between tori: 
~ JR'.n j(21f7Ln) 
II 
---> 
,][,n 
---> 1. 
The kernel N of 1f is a (d - n )-dimensional Lie subgroup of ']['d with inclusion 
i : N '---+ ']['d. Let n be the Lie algebra of N. The exact sequence of tori 
induces an exact sequence of Lie algebras 
with dual exact sequence 
0---> (JR'.n)* -=-=-. (JR'.d)* ~ 
n* ---> 0 . 
Now consider Cd with symplectic form Wo = 
~ L dZk 1\ dzk, and standard 
hamiltonian action of ']['d given by

The moment map is ¢ : Cd ---> (JR'.d)* defined by 
where we choose the constant to be (>'1,"" Ad). By Exercise 6, the subtorus N 
acts on Cd in a hamiltonian way with moment map 
i* 0 ¢ : Cd ---> n* 
Let Z = (i* 0 ¢)-J (0) be the zero-level set. 
Claim 1. The set Z is compact and N acts freely on Z. 
We postpone the proof of this claim until further down. 

1.2. Classification

Since i* is surjective, 0 E n* is a regular value of i* 0 ¢. Hence, Z is a 
compact submanifold of Cd of (real) dimension 2d - (d - n) = d + n. The orbit 
space Mt::" = Z/N is a compact manifold of (real) dimension dimZ - dimN = 
(d + n) - (d - n) = 2n. The point-orbit map p : Z ---+ Mt::" is a principal N-bundle 
over Mt::". Consider the diagram 
where j : Z '----+ Cd is inclusion. The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem guarantees 
the existence of a symplectic form Wt::" on Mt::" satisfying 
* 
.* 
P Wt::" = J Wo . 
Since Z is connected, the compact symplectic 2n-dimensional manifold (Mt::", wt::,,) 
is also connected. 
Proof of Claim 1. The set Z is clearly closed, hence in order to show that it is 
compact it suffices (by the Heine-Borel theorem) to show that Z is bounded. Let 
~' be the image of ~ by Jr*. We will show that ¢( Z) = 
~'. 
Lemma 1.2.10. Let y E (JRd)*. Then: 
Y E ~' -¢=} y is in the image of Z by ¢ . 
Proof. 
The value y is in the image of Z by ¢ if and only if both of the following 
conditions hold: 
1. y is in the image of ¢; 
2. i*y = O. 
Using the expression for ¢ and the third exact sequence, we see that these 
conditions are equivalent to: 
1. (y, ei) :::; Ai for i = 1, ... ,d; 
2. y = Jr*(x) for some x E (JRn)*. 
Suppose that the second condition holds, so that y = Jr*(x). Then 
(y, ei) :::; Ai, \Ii 
-¢=} 
(Jr*(x), ei) :::; Ai, \Ii 
-¢=} 
(x, Jr(e,)) :::; Ai, \Ii 
-¢=} 
(x, Vi) :::; Ai, \Ii 
-¢=} 
xE~.

Thus, y E ¢(Z) ~ 
Y E 1f*(,6.) = ,6.'. 
D 
Since we have that ,6.' is compact, that ¢ is a proper map and that ¢(Z) = ,6.', 
we conclude that Z must be bounded, and hence compact. 
It remains to show that N acts freely on Z. 
Pick a vertex p of ,6., and let I = {i I, ... , in} be the set of indices for the n 
facets meeting at p. Pick z E Z such that ¢( z) = 1f* (p). Then p is characterized 
by n equations (p, Vi) = Ai where i ranges in I: 
(p, Vi) = Ai 
~ (p,1f(ei)) = Ai 
~ (1f*(p), ei) = Ai 
~ (¢(z), ei) = Ai 
~ i-th coordinate of ¢(z) is equal to Ai 
~ -~IZiI2 + Ai = Ai 
~ Zi = o. 
Hence, those z's are points whose coordinates in the set I are zero, and whose 
other coordinates are nonzero. Without loss of generality, we may assume that 
I = {I, ... , n}. The stabilizer of z is 
(,][,d)z = {(tI , ... , tn, 1, ... ,1) E ']['d} . 
As the restriction 1f : (JRd)z 
--> JRn maps the vectors e], ... , en to a Z-basis 
VI, ... ,Vn of zn (respectively), at the level of groups, 1f : (,][,d)z --> ,][,n must be 
bijective. Since N = ker(1f : ']['d --> ']['n), we conclude that N n (,][,d)z = {e}, i.e., 
N z = {e}. Hence all N-stabilizers at points mapping to vertices are trivial. But 
this was the worst case, since other stabilizers NZI (z' E Z) are contained in sta-
bilizers for points z which map to vertices. This concludes the proof of Claim 1. 
D 
Given a Delzant polytope ,6., we have constructed a symplectic manifold 
(Mt:,.,wt:,.) where Mt:,. = ZjN is a compact 2n-dimensional manifold and Wt:,. is the 
reduced symplectic form. 
Claim 2. The manifold (Mt:,., wt:,.) is a hamiltonian ']['n-space with a moment map 
/1t:,. having image /1t:,.(Mt:,.) = ,6.. 
Proof of Claim 2. Let z be such that ¢(z) = 1f*(p) where p is a vertex of ,6., as in 
the proof of Claim 1. Let (J : ,][,n --> (,][,d)z be the inverse for the earlier bijection 
1f : (']['d) z --> ']['n. Since we have found a section, i.e., a right inverse for 1f, in the 
exact sequence

The action of the 'In factor (or, more rigorously, a('fn) c 'fd) descends to the 
quotient M6. = Z/N. 
It remains to show that the 'In-action on M6. is hamiltonian with appropriate 
moment map. 
Consider the diagram

the composition of the horizontal maps is constant along N-orbits, it descends to 
a map 
which satisfies 
116. 0 P = u* 0 ¢ 0 j . 
By Exercise 15 on reduction for product groups, this is a moment map for the 
action of 'In on (M6.,w6.). Finally, the image of 116. is: 
I1dM6.) = (116. 0 p)(Z) = (u* 0 ¢ 0 j)(Z) = (u* 0 7f*)(~) = ~ , 
because ¢(Z) = 7f*(~) and u* 07f* = (7f 0 u)* = id. 
We conclude that (M6., W6., 'In, 116.) is the required toric manifold correspond-
ing to ~.

By the remark in Section I.2.3, Delzant's construction yields a natural Kiihler 
structure on each symplectic toric manifold.

Idea Behind Delzant's Construction 
The space IRd is universal in the sense that any n-dimensional polytope ~ with 
d facets can be obtained by intersecting the negative orthant IR~ with an affine 
plane A. Given ~, to construct A first write ~ as: 
~ = {x E IRn I (x, v2 )

Then 1T* - A: IRn ----+ IRd is an affine map, where A = (Al"'" Ad). Let A be the

• The set ¢-1 (A) C Cd is a compact submanifold. Let i : ¢-l(A) '--+ Cd 
denote inclusion. Then i*wo is a closed 2-form which is degenerate. Its kernel 
is an integrable distribution. The corresponding foliation is called the null 
foliation. 
• The null foliation of i*wo is a principal fibration, so we take the quotient: 
Let Wi> be the reduced symplectic form. 
• The (non-effective) action of ']['d = N x ,][,n on ¢ -1 (A) has a "moment map" 
with image ¢(¢-l(A)) = ~. (By "moment map" we mean a map satisfying 
the usual definition even though the closed 2-form is not symplectic.)

where pr2 : '[d = N x ,[n -+ ,[n is projection onto the second factor. 
Theorem 1.2.12. For any x E ~, we have that fL61(X) is a single '["-orbit. 
Proof. Exercise: First consider the standard '[d-action on Cd with moment map 
¢ : Cd -+ ]Rd. Show that ¢-l(y) is a single ,[d-orbit for any y E ¢(Cd). Now observe 
that 
Y E ~' = 1r*(~) ¢=} ¢-l(y) <;;; Z . 
Suppose that y = 1r*(x). Show that fL6 1(x) = ¢-l(y)/N. But ¢-l(y) is a single 
,[d-orbit where '[d = N x '[n, hence fL 61 (x) is a single '[n-orbit. 
D 
Therefore, for toric manifolds, ~ is the orbit space. 
Now ~ is a manifold with corners. At every point p in a face F, the tangent 
space Tp~ is the subspace of]Rn tangent to F. We can visualize (Me:.., We:.., '[n, fLe:..) 
from ~ as follows. First take the product ,[n x ~. Let p lie in the interior of ,[" x~. 
The tangent space at p is ]Rn x (]R") *. Define wI' by: 
for all v, v' E ]Rn and ~, e E (]R") *. Then w is a closed nondegenerate 2-form on 
the interior of ,[n x ~. At the corner there are directions missing in (]Rn) *, so w is 
a degenerate pairing. Hence, we need to eliminate the corresponding directions in 
]R". To do this, we collapse the orbits corresponding to subgroups of '[71 generated 
by directions orthogonal to the annihilator of that face. 
Example. Consider 
(S2,w=d()l\dh,Sl,fL=h) , 
where SI acts on S2 by rotation. The image of fL is the line segment I = [-1, 1]. 
The product Sl x I is an open-ended cylinder. By collapsing each end of the 
cylinder to a point, we recover the 2-sphere.

Moment Polytopes 
The general theme behind this and Lecture 6 is how to understand a toric man-
ifold from its polytope. After reviewing the basics of Morse theory following [39], 
we compute the homology of symplectic toric manifolds using Morse theory; an 
appropriate Morse function is provided by a moment map with respect to a suit-
able circle subgroup. We go on to describe elementary surgery constructions based 
on symplectic reduction, which hold in the category of symplectic toric manifolds. 
1.3.1 
Equivariant Darboux Theorem 
The following two theorems describe standard neighborhoods of fixed points. Their 
proofs rely on the equivariant version of the Moser trick and may be found in [27]. 
Theorem 1.3.1. (Equivariant Darboux) 
Let (M, w) be a 2n-dimensional symplec-
tic manifold equipped with a symplectic action of a compact Lie group G, and let 
q be a fixed point. Then there exists a G -invariant chart (U, Xl, ... , Xn, Yl , ... , Yn) 
centered at q and G-equivariant with respect to a linear action of G on ]R2n such 
that 
n 
wlu = Ldxk /\ dYk . 
k=l 
A suitable linear action on ]R2n is equivalent to the induced action of G 
on TqM. In particular, if G is a torus, this linear action is characterized by the 
weights occuring in the representation of G on TqM. Now any symplectic action is 
locally hamiltonian. In order to prepare the computation of the Betti numbers of 
a symplectic toric manifold by using a moment map as a Morse function, we next 
specify the local picture for a moment map near a fixed point of a hamiltonian 
torus action. 
Theorem 1.3.2. Let (M2n , W, 1['''', jJ,) be a hamiltonian 1['m -space, where q is a fixed 
point. Then there exists a chart (U, Xl, ... , Xn, Yl, ... , Yn) centered at q and weights 
A(1), ... , A(n) E zm such that 
(aj

and

This theorem guarantees the existence of a Darboux chart centered at any 
fixed point where the moment map looks like the moment map for a linear action

on JR2n. In other words, the real analogue of the model in Exercise 9 is a general 
local picture near a fixed point of a hamiltonian torus action. 
Exercise 24 
Show that for a symplectic toric manifold the weights ).. (1) , ... , ).. (n) form a 
Z-basis of zrn. 
As a consequence of Theorem 1.3.2 and of the previous exercise, the bijec-
tion claimed in Delzant's theorem is well-defined. Indeed, each vertex of a moment 
polytope satisfies the simplicity, rationality and smoothness conditions which char-
acterize Delzant polytopes. 
Another consequence of Theorem 1.3.2 is that a moment map for a symplectic 
toric manifold yields a lot of Morse functions, as we will next explore. 
1.3.2 
Morse Theory 
Let M be an m-dimensional manifold. A smooth function f : M --+ JR is a Morse 
function on M if all of its critical points are nondegenerate. 9 
The index of a bilinear function H : JRm x JRm --+ JR is the maximal dimension 
of a subspace of JR where H is negative definite. The nullity of H is the dimension of 
its nulls pace , that is, the subspace consisting of all v E JRm such that H (v, w) = 0 
for all w E JR"'. Hence, a critical point q of f : M --+ JR is nondegenerate if and 
only if the hessian Hq : JR'" x JRrH --+ JR has nullity equal to zero. 
Let q be a nondegenerate critical point for f : M --+ lR. The index of f at q is 
the index of the hessian Hq : JR'" x JR'" --+ JR. This is well-defined, i.e., the index is 
independent of the choice of local coordinates. Moreover, the Morse lemma states 
that there is a coordinate chart (U, Xl, ... , xm) centered at q such that 
:2 
:2 
:2 
:2 
flu = f(q) - (xd - ... - (x.\) + (x.\+d + ... + (xm) , 
where A is the index of f at q. In particular, nondegenerate critical points are 
necessarily isolated. 
Let f be a Morse function on M. For a E JR, let 
M" = r1(-oo,a] = {p EM I f(p)::; a} 
9 A point q E M is a critical point of f if dfq = O. A critical point is nondegenerate if the hessian 
matrix 
( 
02 f ) 
aX., ax] 
q 
is nonsingular, where the X, 's are local coordinates near q. (The condition that the hessian 
matrix is nonsingular is independent of the choice of coordinates.) The hessian matrix defines a 
symmetric bilinear function Hq : JRm. X JRrn. -. JR given by inner product

and also called the hessian of f at q relative to the local coordinates X,; the hessian is in fact the 
expression in coordinates of a natural bilinear form on the tangent space at q.

Theorem 1.3.3. (Morse [40], Milnor [39]) 
(a) Let a < b and suppose that the set f- 1 [a, b], consisting of all p E M with 
a:'S f(p) :'S b, is compact, and contains no critical points of f. Then Ma is 
diffeomorphic to Mb. Furthermore, Ma is a deformation retract of M b, so 
that the inclusion map Ma '----+ Mb is a homotopy equivalence. 
(b) Let q be a nondegenerate critical point with index A and f(q) = c. Suppose 
that f-l[c - c, C + c] is compact, and contains no critical point of f other 
than q, for some c > O. Then, for all sufficiently small c, the set MC+c has 
the homotopy type of MC-c with a A-cell attached. 
(c) If each set Ma is compact, then the manifold M has the homotopy type of a 
OW-complex with one cell of dimension A for each critical point of index A. 
A k-cell is simply a k-dimensional disk Dk, and it gets attached along its 
boundary Sk-l. Morse's original treatment did not include part (c) of Theo-
rem 1.3.3. Instead, his main results were phrased in terms of inequalities. Let 
bk(M) := dim Hk(M) be the k-th Betti number of M. Let M be a compact man-
ifold and f a Morse function on M. Let C).. be the number of critical points of f 
with index A.

f is a perfect Morse function.

Homology of Symplectic Toric Manifolds 
Let (M, w, ']['n, fJ) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic toric manifold. Choose a suitably 
generic direction in IRn by picking a vector X whose components are independent 
over Q. This condition ensures that: 
• the one-dimensional subgroup, T X c ']['n, generated by the vector X is dense 
in ']['n, 

I.3. Moment Polytopes 
• X is not parallel to the facets of the moment polytope ~ := /-L(M), and 
• the vertices of ~ have different projections along X. 
Exercise 25

the action restricted to ']['X, that is, are the zeros of the vector field, X# on M

121 
Let /-Lx := (/-L, X) : M --> JR. be the projection of /-L along X. By definition 
of moment map, /-Lx is a hamiltonian function for the vector field X# generated 
by X. We conclude from the previous exercise that the critical points of W' are 
precisely the fixed points of the ']['''-action. 
By Theorem 1.3.2, if q is a fixed point for the ,][,II-action, then there exists a 
chart (U, Xl, ... ,X,/) Y1, ... ,y,,) centered at q and weights .\(1), ... , .\ (IL) E Z" such 
that 
Since the components of X are independent over Q, all coefficients (.\ (k), X) are 
nonzero, so q is a nondegenerate critical point of /-Lx. Moreover, the index of q is 
twice the number oflabels k such that _(.\(k), X) < O. But the -.\(k)'s are precisely 
the edge vectors Ui which satisfy Delzant's conditions. Therefore, geometrically, 
the index of q can be read from the moment polytope ~, by taking twice the 
number of edges whose inward-pointing edge vectors at /-L(q) point up relative to 
X, that is, whose inner product with X is positive. In particular, /-Lx is a perfect 
Morse function. By applying Corollary 1.3.5 we conclude that: 
Theorem 1.3.6. Let X E JR." have components independent over Q. The degree-2k 
homology group of the symplectic toric manifold (M, w, '][', /-L) has dimension equal 
to the number of vertices of the moment polytope ~ where there are exactly k 
(primitive inward-pointing) edge vectors which point up relative to the projection 
along the X. All odd-degree homology groups of M are zero.

[p] E lP'n~l is the complex line in en represented by that point. 
Definition 1.3.7. The blow-up of en at the origin is the total space of the bundle L. 
The corresponding blow-down map is the map (3 : L --> en defined by (3([p], z) = z. 
Notice that the total space of L may be decomposed as the disjoint union of 
two sets, 
and 
S := {([p], z) I pEen \ {O} , z = AP for some A E C*} . 
The set E is called the exceptional divisor; it is diffeomorphic to lP'n~l and gets 
mapped to the origin by (3. On the other hand, the restriction of (3 to the com-
plementary set S is a diffeomorphism onto en \ {O}. Hence, we may regard L as 
being obtained from C' by smoothly replacing the origin by a copy of lP'n~l. 
There are actions of the unitary group U(n) on all of these sets induced by 
the standard linear action on en, and the map (3 is U (n )-equivariant. 
Definition 1.3.8. A blow-up symplectic form on L is a U(n)-invariant symplectic 
form w such that the difference w -
(3* Wo is compactly supported, where Wo = 
n 
~ 2.: dZk /\ dZk is the standard symplectic form on en. 
k=l 
Two blow-up symplectic forms are called equivalent if one is the pullback of 
the other by a U(n)-equivariant diffeomorphism of L. Guillemin and Sternberg [26] 
have shown that two blow-up symplectic forms are equivalent if and only if they 
have equal restrictions to the exceptional divisor EeL. 
Let DE (c: > 0) be the set of all blow-up symplectic forms on L whose restric-
tion to the exceptional divisor E '2:' lP'n~l is c:wFS , where wFS is the Fubini-Study 
form on lP'n~l described in Lecture 2. An c:-blow-up of en at the origin is a pair 
(L,w) with wE DE. 

I.3. Moment Polytopes 
123 
Let (M, w) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold. It is a consequence of 
the Darboux theorem that, for each point q EM, there exists a chart (U, ZI, ... , zn) 
centered at q and with image in cn where 
. 
n 
wlu = ~ Ldzk /\ dZk 
k=1 
It is shown in [26] that, for c small enough, we can perform an c-blow-up of M at 
q modeled on Cn at the origin, without changing the symplectic structure outside 
of a small neighborhood of q. The resulting manifold is then called an c-blow-up 
of Mat q. 
Example. Let lP'(L EEl q be the lP'1-bundle over lP'n-l obtained by projectivizing the 
direct sum of the tautological line bundle L with a trivial complex line bundle. 
Consider the map 
j3 : 
lP' (L EEl q 
----+ 
lP'n 
([p], [Ap : w]) 
f----7 
[AP: w] 
where [Ap : w] on t.he right. represents a line in Cn + 1, forgetting that, for each 
[p] E lP'n-l , that line sits in the 2-complex-dimensional subspace L[p] EEl C C C n EEl C. 
Notice that j3 maps the exceptional divisor 
E:= {([p], [0: ... : 0: 1]) I [p] E lP'1I-1} :::::: lP'/-1 
to the point [0: ... : 0 : 1] E lP''', whereas j3 is a diffeomorphism on the complement 
S := {([p], [Ap : w]) I [p] E lP'n-1 , A E <C* , wE <C} :::::: lP''' \ {[O : ... : 0 : I]} . 
Therefore, we may regard lP'(L EEl C) as being obtained from lP'n by smoothly re-
placing the point [0 : ... : 0 : 1] by a copy of lP'n-l. The space lP'(L EEl q is the 
blow-up of lP'n at the point [0 : ... : 0 : 1], and j3 is t.he corresponding blow-down 
map. The manifold lP'(L EEl C) for n = 2 is known as the first Hirzebruch surface. 
Exercise 27 
Write a definition for blow-up of a symplectic manifold along a complex sub-
manifold by considering the projectivi)lation of the normal bundle to the sub-
manifold. 
\; 
Symplectic blow-up is due to Gromov according to the first printed exposition 
of this operation in [35].

Blow-Up of Toric Manifolds 
Suppose that a compact Lie group acts on a symplectic manifold (M, w) in a 
hamiltonian way, and that q E M is a fixed point for the G-action. Then, by 
Theorem 1.3.1, there exists a Darboux chart (U,Zl"" ,zn) centered at q which is 
G-equivariant with respect to a linear action of G on Cn. Consider an c-blow-up 
of M relative to this chart, for c sufficiently small. 
Exercise 28 
Check that G acts on the blow-up in a hamiltonian way. Describe the moment 
map. 
Let,6. be an n-dimensional Delzant polytope, and let (Me.,we.,Tn,/-le.) be 
the associated symplectic toric manifold. The c-blow-up of (Me., we.) at a fixed 
point of the Tn-action is a new symplectic toric manifold. What is the moment 
polytope ,6.E corresponding to this new symplectic toric manifold? 
Let q be a fixed point of the Tn-action on (Me.,we.), and let p = /-le.(q) be 
the corresponding vertex of ,6.. (Cf. Exercise 16.) Let Ul, .. " Un be the primitive 
(inward-pointing) edge vectors at p, so that the rays p + tUi, t 2 0, form the edges 
of ,6. at p. 
Theorem 1.3.9. The c-blow-up of (Me., we.) at a fixed point q is the symplectic toric 
manifold associated to the polytope,6." obtained from ,6. by replacing the vertex p 
by the n vertices 
p + cUi, 
i = 1, ... , n . 
In other words, the moment polytope for the blow-up of (Me., we.) at q is 
obtained from ,6. by chopping off the corner corresponding to q, thus substituting 
the original set of vertices by the same set with the vertex corresponding to q 
replaced by exactly n new vertices: 
p 
Proof. Exercise: Check that the new polytope is Delzant. We may view the c-
blow-up of (Me.,we.) as being obtained from Me. by smoothly replacing q by 
(IP'n-l, cWFS ). Compute the restriction of the moment map to this set. Recall Ex-
ere~e22.

1.3. Moment Polytopes 
125 
Example. The moment polytope for the standard 1['2-action on (jp'2, wFS ) is a right 
isosceles triangle ~. If we blow-up jp'2 at [0 : 0 : 1] we obtain a symplectic toric 
manifold associated to the trapezoid below. 
(3 
Exercise 29 
Check that this manifold is the first Hirzebruch surface, defined in Section 1.3.4. 
Example. The following moment polytope corresponds to a toric manifold obtained 
by blowing-up jp'2 at the three fixed points: 
Exercise 30 
The toric 4-manifold H" corresponding to the polygon with vertices (0,0), 
(n + 1,0), (0,1) and (1,1), for n a nonnegative integer, is called a Hirzebruch 
surface. 
The manifold Ho is just a product of two spheres, whereas by the previous 
example H1 is a blow-up of p2 at a point. 
(a) Construct the manifold Hn by symplectic reduction of re4 with respect 
to an action of (Sl)2.

1.3.6 
Symplectic Cutting 
Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold where S1 acts in a hamiltonian way, p : S1 --+ 
Diff(M) , with moment map p : M --+ R Suppose that: 
• M has a unique nondegenerate minimum at q where p(q) = 0, and 
• for E sufficiently small, Sl acts freely on the level set p-1(E). 
Let C be equipped with the symplectic form -idz /\ dz. Then the action of S1 on 
the product 
7/J : Sl ----+ Diff(M x q , 
is hamiltonian with moment map 
¢(p, z) = p(p) -lzl2 . 
Observe that S1 acts freely on the E-level of ¢ for E small enough: 
{(p,z) EM x C I p(p) -lzl2 = E} 
{(p,O) EM x C I p(p) = E} 
u {(p, z) EM x C IIzl2 = p(p) -
E > O} . 
The reduced space is hence 
The open submanifold of M given by {p E M I p(p) > E} embeds as an open 
dense submanifold into ¢-l(E)/Sl. 
Exercise 31 
Show that the reduced space rP-l(c)jSl is the c-blow-up of Mat q. 
This global description of blow-up for hamiltonian Sl-spaces is due to Ler-
man [31]' as a particular instance of his cutting technique. Symplectic cutting is 
the application of symplectic reduction to the product of a hamiltonian S1-space 
with the standard C as above, in a way that the reduced space for the original 
hamiltonian S1-space embeds symplectically as a co dimension 2 submanifold in a 
symplectic manifold. 
As it is a local construction, the cutting operation may be more generally 
performed at a local minimum (or maximum) of the moment map p. 
There is a remaining Sl-action on the cut space Mc~~ := ¢-l(E)/Sl induced 
by 
T : Sl ----+ Diff(M x q , 
In fact, T is a hamiltonian S1-action on M x C which commutes with 7/J, thus 
descends to an action T: Sl --+ Diff(Mc~,~). 

I.3. Moment Polytopes 
127 
Exercise 32 
Show that T is hamiltonian by describing a moment map. 
Loosely speaking, the cutting technique provides a hamiltonian way to close 
the open manifold {p E M I p,(p) > c}, by using the reduced space at level c, 
p,-1(c)j51 . We may similarly close {p EM I p,(p) < c}. The resulting hamiltonian 
5 1-spaces are called cut spaces, and denoted MC~J~ and MC~J~. Of course, if another 
group G acts on M in a hamiltonian way which commutes with the 5 1-action, 
then the cut spaces are also hamiltonian G-spaces.

1roric \Tarieties 
The goal of this lecture is to explain toric manifolds as a special class of projective 
varieties. The first five sections contain a crash course on notions and basic facts 
about algebraic varieties, mostly in order to fix notation. The combinatorial flavor 
of toric varieties is postponed until Lecture 5. 
11.1.1 
Affine Varieties 
Let qZ1, ... ,znl be the algebra of polynomials in the n complex coordinate func-
tions on <cn . Throughout this lecture, we consider the Zariski topology on en: a 
(Zariski) closed set in <cn is a set of common zeros of a finite number of polynomi-
als from <C[Zl' ... ,znl; naturally, the complement of a Zariski closed set is called a 
(Zariski) open set. The fact that any infinite intersection of closed sets is indeed 
a closed set follows from the stabilization property for sets given as zero sets of 
polynomials: any decreasing sequence of such sets Xl ::J X 2 ::J ... stabilizes, i.e., 
there exists an integer r such that X,. = X,. + 1 = .... This is a restatement of 
Hilbert's basis theorem which says that any ideal in qZl, ... ,znl is finitely gen-
erated; see, for instance, [50, §IV-l]. Notice that any nonempty open set is dense 
(i.e., its closure is the full space), hence the Zariski topology is not Hausdorff. 
Definition 11.1.1. An affine variety is a nonempty closed set in a <cn . 
The Zariski topology on an affine variety X c C' is the topology on X 
which declares to be (Zariski) open (respectively, closed) every set which is the 
intersection of X with an open (resp., closed) subset of <cn . An affine variety X is 
irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets. On 
an irreducible affine variety, any nonempty open subset is dense.

II. Algebraic Viewpoint 
Example. The zero locus in e2 of the polynomial ZlZ2 is not irreducible; its irre-
ducible components are given by the lines Zl = 0 and Z2 = o. 
0 
Exercise 33 
Let X C en be the affine variety defined as the zero locus of polynomials 
PI, ... ,Pr E qZI, ... , zn]. Show that X is irreducible if and only if the ideal 
generated by PI, ... ,Pr is prime (an ideal I C q Z 1, ... , zn] is prime if whenever 
U, v E e[Zl' ... , 
and uv E I, then u E I or v E I). 
Let X c en be an affine variety presented as the zero locus of polynomials 
P1,··· ,p,. E e[Zl,".' Zn]. 
Definition 11.1.2. A regular function on X is a function X --+ e which is the 
restriction to X of a polynomial function in en. The ring of regular functions on 
X is denoted qX]. 
Exercise 34 
Show that the ring qX] is isomorphic to qZI, ... , zn]1 I, where I is the ideal 
generated by Pl, ... ,pr' 
Let X c en and X' c ern be affine varieties. 
Definition 11.1.3. A regular map from X to X' is a map cp : X --+ X' which is the 
restriction of a polynomial map en --+ em. 
Exercise 35 
Show that a map 'P : X ---+ X' is regular if and only if it pulls back regular 
functions on X, to regular functions on X. 
Definition 11.1.4. An isomorphism from X to X' is a regular map X --+ X' which 
is invertible by a regular map. The symbol c:::: indicates an isomorphism. The group 
of isomorphisms X --+ X is denoted by Isom(X). The affine varieties X and X' 
are isomorphic when there exists an isomorphism between them. 
Exercise 36 
Show that X and X' are isomorphic if and only if the associated rings of regular 
functions, qX] and qx/], are isomorphic. 
Example. Consider the variety X = {ZiZn+i = 1 ,i = 1, ... ,n} C e 2n ; for n = 1, 
this is the (complex) hyperbola with {Zl = o} and {Z2 = o} as asymptotes. On 
X the functions Zl, ... , Zn E e[X] are invertible by regular functions: Z;-l = Zn+i. 

IIi. Toric Varieties 
131 
Hence the ring of regular functions on X is the ring of Laurent polynomials in n 
variables: 
qX] =qzl,Zll, ... ,zn,z;l]. 
The projection C 2n --> Cn onto the first n components maps X isomorphic ally 
onto the n-dimensional algebraic torus 
(C*)n := (C \ {o})n = C n \ hyperplanes Zi = 0 , i = 1, ... n . 
Hence we have 
X~ (C*)n 
(ZI' ... ' Zn, Zn+I, ... , Z2n) 
f------+ 
(Z1' ... , zn) 
(Zl' zll, ... , Zn, z;;:-l) 
f---
(ZI' ... ,zn) . 
This shows that the torus (c*)n is an affine variety. Note that the coordinates 
ZI, ... ,Zn are invertible by regular functions on (c*)n, whereas they were not 
invertible by regular functions on C n .

11.1.2 
Rational Maps on Affine Varieties 
If Xc Cn and X' C Cm are affine varieties, the symbol X --~ X' denotes a map 
defined on some open subset of X. 
Example. If PI, P2 E qZl, ... zn], then the rational function defined on the set 
{P2 =f. O} by Z f--+ ~~i~i is a map en --~ c. 
<) 
Let X C Cn be an irreducible affine variety. 
Definition 11.1.5. A rational function on X is a map X ~~~ C which is the restric-
tion of a rational function on Cn whose denominator does not vanish identically 
on X. The ring of rational functions on X is denoted Ox. 
Let C(X) denote the field of fractions of qX], and let Ix be the ideal in 
o x formed by the rational functions on Cn whose numerator vanishes identically 
on X. 
Exercise 37 
Show that the field IC(X) is isomorphic to the quotient Ox/Ix. 
An irreducible affine variety X is normal if its ring of regular functions qX] 
is integrally closed in its field of fractions, that is, for any f E qX), if f satisfies 
an equation of the form 
rn + gl fm -1 + ... + gm = 0 
with coefficients gi E qX], then f E qX]. 
Any smooth variety is normal and the set of singular points of a normal 
variety has codimension at least 2 [44].

not normal. 
2. The cone X C C3 given by x 2 + y2 
singular point at the origin 
Z2 is normal [44], though it has a 
Let X c Cn and X' C Cm be affine varieties. 
Definition 11.1.6. A rational map from X to X' is a map if! : X ---t X' which is 
the restriction of a rational map Cn ---t Cm whose denominator does not vanish 
identically on X. 
Exercise 38 
Show that a map 'P : X ---> X' is rational if and only if it pulls back rational 
functions on X' to rational functions on x. 
Definition 11.1.7. A birational equivalence from X to X' is a rational map X ---t 
X' which is invertible by a rational map. The affine varieties X and X' are bira-
tionally equivalent when there exists a birational equivalence between them. 
Exercise 39 
Show that X and X' are birationally equivalent if and only if the associated 
fields of rational functions, IC(X) and IC(X'), are isomorphic. 
A hypersurface in Cn is the zero set of one polynomial in C [Zl' ... ,zn]. Any 
affine variety is birationally equivalent to a hypersurface of some space cm; for a 
proof see, for example, [44]. 
11.1.3 
Projective Varieties 
We say that a polynomial p E C[zo, ... ,zn] vanishes at a point [wo : ... : wn] E lP'n 
if p(AWo, ... ,AWn) = 0 for all A E C*. Notice that this condition implies that each 
homogeneous component of p vanishes. 
We consider the Zariski topology on lP'n: a (Zariski) closed set in lP'n is a set 
of common zeros of a finite number of polynomials from C[zo, ... , zn]; as usual, 
the complement of a Zariski closed set is called a (Zariski) open set. By consider-
ing homogeneous components, we may assume that each of those polynomials is 
homogeneous. A hypersurface in lP'n is the zero set of one (reduced) homogeneous 
polynomial in qzo, ... ,zn] \ {O}, the degree of which is called the degree of the 

IIl. Toric Varieties 
133 
hypersurface1 . A hypersurface of degree 2,3,4, ... is traditionally called a quadric 
(except in 1P'2 when it is called a conic), a cubic, a quartic, etc.2 
Definition 11.1.8. A projective variety is a nonempty closed subset of some pro-
jective space IP'rt. 
The Zariski topology on a projective variety X C IP'rt is the topology on X 
which declares to be (Zariski) open (respectively, closed) every set which is the 
intersection of X with an open (resp., closed) subset of IP'rt. A projective variety 
X is irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets. 
Examples. 
1. The product of two projective spaces is a projective variety. This can be seen 
via the Segre embedding 
S: 
IP'rt X IP'm 
------> 
IP'rtm+rt+m 
([z], [w]) 
f---> 
[z (9 w] . 
The homogeneous coordinates of an image point [z (9 w] are 
Yij := Z,Wj, 
i = 0, ... ,n , j = 0, ... , m . 
The image of S is the set cut out by the system of equations 
{ i' k : 0, ... , n 
J,£ - 0, ... ,m 
thus S(lP'rt X 1P'7n) c:::: IP'n x IP'm is a nonempty closed subset of IP'rtm+n+m. In 
particular, S(lP'l x 1P'1) is the subset of points [yoo : YOl : YlO : Yll] E IP':' 
determined by the single quadratic equation 
YOOYll = YOIYIO , 
hence S (1P'1 x 1P'1) is a nondegenerate quadric in IP':'. 
2. The set of lines in IP'n through the point [0 : ... : 0 : 1] E IP'rt (or, similarly, 
through any other point), is naturally identified with IP'n-l via 
IP'rt-l

{lines in IP'rt through [0: ... : 0 : I]} 
[w]

L[wJ:= {[AWo : ... : AWn-I: ,]1 (A, ,) E ([:2 \ {(O, O)}} 
1 A polynomial is reduced if each of its irreducible factors has multiplicity 1. For some ap-
plications it is convenient to allow for nonreduced polynomials and then consider that some 
components of the hypersurface have multiplicities. 
2 A hypersurface of degree 1 is called a line when in ]p'2, a plane when in ]p':l, and a hyperplane 
in higher projective spaces.

II. Algebraic Viewpoint 
The blow-up of 1pm at [0 : ... : 0 : 1], B(JlDn, [0 : ... : 0 : 1]), is the subset of 
JlDn x JlDn-l defined by the incidence relation 
B(lpm, [0: ... : 0 : 1]) := {([w], [z]) E JlDn- 1 x JlDn I [z] E L[w]} . 
This can be translated as the closed subset of JlDn x JlDn-l defined by the 
system of equations 
2 
The Segre embedding exhibits 1pm x JlDn-l as a projective variety in JlDn +n-1, 
hence B(JlDn, [0 : ... : 0 : 1]) is a projective variety. 
Since the point [0 : ... : 0 : 1] belongs to any line through it, the set 
B(lIlm , [0 : ... : 0 : 1]) decomposes as the disjoint union of the so-called 
exceptional divisor, 
E := {([w], [0: ... : 0 : 1]) I [w] E JlDn-l} :::: JlDn- 1 , 
with 
S := {([w], [w : y]) I [w] E JlDn- 1 , y E C} :::: JlDn \ {[O : ... : 0 : I]} . 
Let X c JlDn be a projective variety. 
Definition 11.1.9. A regular function on X is a Junction X ----) C which, locally near 
each point x EX, may be written as a quotient oj two homogeneous polynomials 
oj the same degree such that the denominator does not vanish at x. The ring oj 
regular Junctions on X is denoted ([[X]. 
Any regular function on JlDn is constant. More generally, it can be shown that 
([[X] = C whenever X is an irreducible projective variety [44]. Therefore, the ring 
([[X] will not give much information. 
Let X c JlDn and X' c JlDm be projective varieties. Recall that complex 
projective space JlDn comes equipped with n + 1 affine neighborhoods given by the 
standard charts (k = 0 .... ,n): 
Vk := {[zo : ... : zn]1 Zk # O} 
[zo: ... : zn] 
Definition 11.1.10. A regular map Jrom X to X' is a map cp : X ----) X' such that 
Jor each x E X there exists a neighborhood U oj x and an affine neighborhood V 
oj cp(x) Jor which cp(U) c V and cp : U ----) V is given by m regular Junctions. 

II.l. Toric Varieties 
Exercise 40 
Check that the regularity condition at a point x E X is independent of the 
choice of the affine neighborhood containing f(x). 
135 
Example. A Veronese embedding of degree d is a map V : lP'n ---+ lP'N where 
N = (n1d) - 1 and [zo : ... : znl is mapped to the point with homogeneous 
coordinates given by the various monomials z~o ... z~n, the exponents Ao, ... , An 
being nonnegative integers such that AO + ... + An = d. 
Exercise 41 
Check that the set of all homogeneous polynomials of degree d in n + 1 variables 
zo, ... , Zn forms a vector space of dimension cn;:-d). 
In particular, if n = 1 and d = 2, the Veronese embedding is simply 
V :

[z6: ZOZI : zil . 
Exercise 42 
Check that V is a regular map. 
The Veronese embedding of degree d allows to translate the study of some 
problems concerning hypersurfaces of degree d in lP'TI into the case of hyperplanes 
in lP'N.

Definition 11.1.11. An isomorphism from X to X' is a regular map rp : X ---+ X' 
which is invertible by a regular map. The symbol c:= indicates an isomorphism. The 
group of isomorphisms X ---+ X is denoted by Isom(X). The projective varieties X 
and X' are isomorphic when there exists an isomorphism between them. 
11.1.4 
Rational Maps on Projective Varieties 
If X c lP'n and X' C lP'm are projective varieties, the symbol X --~ X' still denotes 
a map defined on some open subset of X. 
Let X C lP'7l be an irreducible projective variety. 
Definition 11.1.12. A rational function on X is a function lP'H --~ e whose restric-
tion to each affine neighborhood is a rational function on en whose numerator 
and denominator have the same degree and whose denominator does not vanish 
identically on X. The ring of rational functions on X is denoted Ox. 
Let qX) denote the field of fractions of qX], and let Ix be the ideal in 
o x formed by the rational functions on en whose numerator vanishes identically 
onX.

Exercise 43 
Show that the field IC(X) is isomorphic to the quotient Ox/Ix. 
Let X C lpm and X' C jp'm be projective varieties. 
Definition 11.1.13. A rational map from X to jp'm is a map X --+ jp'm which 
is given in homogeneous coordinates for jp'm by m + 1 rational functions on X. A 
rational map from X to X' is the restriction to X' of a rational map cp : X __ + jp'm 
such that there is an open set U C X where cp is regular and cp(U) eX'. 
Definition 11.1.14. A birational equivalence from X to X' is a rational map X --+ 
X' which is invertible by a rational map. The projective varieties X and X' are 
birationally equivalent when there exists a birational equivalence between them. 
Exercise 44 
Show that X and X' are birationally equivalent if and only if the associated 
fields of rational functions, IC(X) and IC(X'), are isomorphic. 
11.1.5 
Quasiprojective Varieties 
The notions before make sense in the broader class of quasiprojective varieties, 
which encompasses both affine and projective varieties. 
Definition 11.1.15. A quasiprojective variety is a nonempty open subset of a pro-
jective variety. 
Zariski topology, regular function, regular map, isomorphism, rational func-
tion, rational map and birational equivalence are defined for quasiprojective va-
rieties analogously to projective varieties. For instance, a (Zariski) closed set of 
a quasiprojective variety is the intersection of the variety with a closed subset 
of projective space. From now on, the term variety (without specifying affine or 
projective) refers to a quasiprojective variety. 
It is a fact that two irreducible varieties X and X' are birationally equivalent 
if and only if they contain isomorphic open subsets U C X and U' C X' [44]. 
Example. The tautological line bundle L defined in Section 1.3.4 is a quasiprojec-
tive variety (yet not affine, nor projective). In fact, the inclusion of en in jp'n as the 
open set of points [zo : ... : zn] with Zn i- 0 induces an inclusion of the blow-up of 
en at the origin as an open subset of the projective variety B(jp'n, [0: ... : 0 : 1]); 
cf. Section 11.1.3. 
The blow-down map (3 : L ---+ en is a birational equivalence in the category 
of quasiprojective varieties.

Blowing-up at a point is a local operation which extends to any quasiprojec-
tive variety modeled on the blow-up of en at the origin or of jp'n at [0: ... : 0 : 1].

An irreducible projective variety X is normal if every point has a normal 
affine neighborhood. 
A normalization of an irreducible variety X is an irreducible normal variety 
X, together with a regular map v : X -+ X which is a finite birational equivalence. 
A map r.p : X -+ X' between varieties is finite, if any point x E X' has an affine 
neighborhood V such that the preimage U := r.p-l (V) is affine and the restriction 
r.p : U -+ V is a finite map, that is every point has a finite number of preimages. 
Any variety is a finite union of irreducible varieties [44]. If X = UiXi presents 
X as a finite union of irreducible closed subsets and Xi ct Xj for all i =I- j, then 
the Xi'S are called irreducible components of X. 
One can define a normalization of an arbitrary variety X as a disjoint union 
of normalizations for each of the irreducible components of X. 
11.1.6 1roric \Tarieties 
The n-complex-dimensional algebraic torus (c*)n is a 2n-dimensional Lie group 
under multiplication of complex numbers. The weight lattice of (c*)n is the lattice 
zn. A character (or a Laurent monomial) of (c*)n is a group homomorphism 
(C*)n -+ c*. 
There is a bijective correspondence between weights and characters of (c*)n: 
A = P'l, ... , An) E zn 
f-----+ 
A: (c*)n -+ c* 
W = (Wl' ... ,Wn ) f---> w A := w;' ..... w~" 
An action of a torus (c*)n on a variety X is a group homomorphism 'ljJ 
(C*)n -+ Isom(X). 
Definition 11.1.16. A toric variety is an irreducible varietyl X equipped with an 
action of an algebraic torus having an open dense orbit. 
Definition 11.1.17. Two toric varieties are equivalent if there exists an equivariant 
isomorphism between them. 
Toric varieties are easy to construct, as the following examples illustrate. 
3Toric varieties are usually required to be normal and normality is always the case for smooth 
varieties, which interest us mostly. However, our discussion does not require normality and is 
shortened without this assumption.

Classification 
Recall that a toric variety is an irreducible quasiprojective variety equipped with 
an action of an algebraic torus having an open dense orbit. In this lecture we 
begin by reviewing the language of spectra used for classifying affine toric varieties. 
Arbitrary normal toric varieties are classified by combinatorial objects called fans. 
11.2.1 
Spectra 
Let A be a finitely generated C-algebra without zero divisors. An ideal I in A is 
prime if 
U, v E A and uv E I 
===} u E I or v E I . 
An ideal I in A is maximal if I =1= A and the only proper ideal in A containing I 
is I itself. 
Exercise 46 
Regard A simply as a commutative ring with unity. Show that the ideal I is 
prime if and only if the quotient ring AI I is an integral domain (i.e., AI I has 
no zero divisors), and that the ideal I is maximal if and only if AI I is a field. 
Exercise 47 
Check that every maximal ideal is prime. Give an example of a prime ideal 
which is not maximal. 
Exercise 48 
Let I be an ideal in A, and let p : A -> AI I be the surjective ring homomor-
phism given by taking an element to its coset in the quotient ring AI I. Check 
that there exists a bijective correspondence between the ideals J of A which 
contain I, and the ideals] of All, given by J = p-l(J). 
The spectrum of the algebra A is the set 
Spec A := { prime ideals in A } 
equipped with the Zariski topology, which declares to be closed a subset of Spec A 
consisting of all prime ideals containing some subset of A. The maximal spectrwn 
of A is the set 
Specm A := { maximal ideals in A } 
equipped with the Zariski topology, which declares to be closed a subset of Specm A 
consisting of all maximal ideals containing some subset of A. 

II. 2. Classification

Examples. 
1. Let A = qZI,"" zn] and let x = (Xl, ... ,Xn) E cn. Associated to the point 
X there is a maximal ideal Ix C A consisting of all polynomials which vanish 
at x, that is, Ix is the ideal generated by the monomials Zl - Xl, ... , Zn - Xn: 
By Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (see, for instance, [5] or [20D, any maximal ideal 
of C[ZI,"" zn] is of the form Ix for some X E cn. Moreover, the correspon-
dence 
c n c::' Specm C[ZI,"" zn] 
'-----v-----" 
IC[cnJ 
is a homeomorphism for the Zariski topology, where we stress that the poly-
nomial ring qZI, ... ,zn] is the ring of regular functions on cn. 
Exercise 49 
Show that there exists a bijective correspondence between Spec C[Zl, ... , znl 
and the set of irreducible subvarieties in cn. 
Hint: Any prime ideal in C[Zl, ... , znl is finitely generated. 
2. Let A = qZI, Zll, ... ,zn, Z;l] and let X = (Xl, ... ,Xn) E (C*)". Associated 
to the point X there is the maximal ideal in A: 
By observing that the ideal (Zl - xI,zll - Yl,"") is the full algebra A 
when Y1 =f. x l 1 since it contains (Zl -
x1)z1 1 + Xl (Z11 - yI) E C*, Hilbert's 
Nullstellensatz implies that any maximal ideal of qZ1' z11, ... ,Zrl? Z~I] is of 
the form Ix. Moreover, the correspondence

regular functions on (c*)n; cf. Section H.l.l.

exists 
a 
bijective 
correspondence

Spec C[Zl,Zll, ... ,Zn,Z,;:;:ll and the set of irreducible subvarieties in

Let X be an affine variety in Cn defined by polynomials PI, . .. ,Pr from 
q Zl, ... ,zn]' Let I = (p1,"" Pr) be the ideal generated by those polynomials.

The correspondence X ':0:' Specm qX] is a homeomorphism for the Zariski topol-
ogy. 
More generally, if A is a finitely generated C-algebra without zero divisors, 
the set XA := Specm A is called an abstract affine variety. While maximal ideals in 
A play the role of points in XA, arbitrary prime ideals are thought of as irreducible 
subvarieties, by analogy with the ring of regular functions on an affine variety. The 
dimension of X A is defined to be 
dim XA := sup{3 chain 10 C he ... C In of distinct prime ideals} . 
nEZ 
When A = qX] is the ring ofregular functions on an irreducible affine variety X, 
the dimension dimXA coincides with the (complex) dimension dim X since both 
are equal to 
sup{3 chain Xo c Xl C ... C Xn = X of distinct irreducible subvarieties} .

11.2.2 
Toric Varieties Associated to Semigroups 
Let S be a commutative semigroup. Its semigroup algebra q S] is the C-algebra 
generated as a complex vector space by the symbols zO" with u E S and multipli-
cation defined by the rule 
In particular, generators Ui for S as a semigroup yield generators zO", for C[S] as 
a C-algebra. 
Examples. 
1. If S = (zt)n, then qS] = qZI, ... ,zn] is the algebra of polynomials in n 
variables. 
2. If S = zn, then qS] = qZI,Zl\ ... ,Zn,Z,;;-I] is the algebra of Laurent 
polynomials in n variables. 

II. 2. Classification 
143 
Notice that in the previous two examples, the maximal spectrum of the semi-
group algebras are toric varieties: 
In fact, we have the following general result: 
Proposition 11.2.1. Let S ~ zn be a finitely generated semigroup. Then the maxi-
mal spectrum Specm qS] is an affine toric variety. 
Proof. By shrinking the lattice zn if necessary, we may assume that S generates 
zn as an abelian group, in which case Specm C[S] has dimension n. The inclusion 
of semi groups S ~ zn and hence of semigroup algebras qS] c qzn] gives an 
embedding of the torus (c*)n: 
Let 0 be the image of this embedding. The torus (c*)n acts on qS] by 
w . ZCT := w" ZCT, for W E (c*)n and a E S . 
This action induces an action of (c*)n on Specm C[S]. By considering the dimen-
sion, the set 0 
:::0 (C*)" is an open orbit for this action. We conclude that its 
closure 0 must be the full Spec", q S] and hence this is a toric variety. 
D 
Example. The complex curve in C 2 with equation yk = Xk+l (k = 1,2,3, ... ) is an 
affine toric variety with C* -action given by 
It may be obtained as Specm qS] for the semigroup S = zt \ {I, 2, ... , k - I} 
generated by {k, k + 1, ... , 2k - I}. 
<) 
Exercise 51 
Show that the variety in the previous example is not normal for k > 1, and 
that its normalization is the affine line X. 
11.2.3 
Classification of Affine Toric Varieties 
Theorem 11.2.2. (Classification of affine toric varieties) 
Any affine tonc variety 
is equivalent to one of the form Specm qS] for some finitely generated semigroup 
S C zn (n? 0). 

144 
II. Algebraic Viewpoint 
Proof. Let X be an affine toric variety for the torus (C * ) m. Let a be the open 
orbit for the (C*)m-action on X. Then a may be identified with the quotient of 
(c*)m by the stabilizer of some point in a. Since this quotient is itself a (possibly 
smaller dimensional) torus, we can regard a itself as a torus (c*)n acting on X. 
By irreducibility of X, we have an embedding qX] c qa] = qzn]. The subring 
qX] c qa] is (C*)n-invariant with respect to the induced actions of (C*)n on 
qX] and on q(C*)n]. As a representation of an algebraic torus, the space qX] 
decomposes into one-dimensional weight spaces. The weight spaces are generated 
by monomials as C-algebras, hence the vector space qX] itself is generated by 
monomials, i.e., it is a semigroup algebra. 
D 
Example. Recall the construction of the affine toric variety YA from a finite set 
A = p,(1), ... ,.x(k)} c zn, described in Section II.1.6. By the previous theorem, 
we must have YA :::::0 Specm qS] for some finitely generated semigroup S c ;En. It 
is not hard to see that S is the semigroup generated by A. In fact, the ring qyA ] 
of regular functions on YA is generated by the restrictions to YA of the coordinate 
functions on Cn . Since YA is the closure of 
{( >.P)

the ring qYA] is generated by the monomials

Remark. The only smooth affine toric varieties are products of the form (C*)P x 
cq. This follows from the classification of affine toric varieties (Theorem 11.2.2), 
the classification of normal toric varieties (Theorem 11.2.10) and the study of 
conditions for smoothness (Exercise 53). See the remark at the end of Section 11.3.4.

Definition II.2.3. A (convex polyhedral) cone in lRn is a set of the form 
for some finite set of vectors VI, ... , Vr E lRn ! then called the generators of the 
cone C. The cone C is rational if it admits a set of generators in ;En. The cone C 
is smooth if it admits a set of generators which is part of some Z-basis of ;En. 
The dimension of a cone C is the dimension of the smallest lR-subspace 
containing C (which is the vector space C + (-C».

Definition 11.2.4. The dual of a cone C C JR.n is 
C* := {f E (JR.n)* I f(x) 2 ° 
\Ix E C} . 
Farkas' theorem states that the dual of a rational cone is a rational cone [21]. 
From the theory of convex sets [20], it follows that (C*)* = C. 
A supporting hyperplane for a cone C C JR.n is a hyperplane of the form 
H j := {x E JR.n I f(x) = o} 
for some f E C* \ {a} . 
A face of a cone C C JR.n is either C itself (a nonproper face) or the intersection of 
C with any supporting hyperplane (proper faces). A face of a cone is itself a cone; 
indeed the face C n H j (with f E C*) is generated by those vectors Vi in a set of 
generators for C such that f (Vi) = 0. 
Exercise 52 
Show that a cone C has only finitely many faces and that any intersection of 
faces is also a face. 
Hint: The face C n H f is generated by those vectors v, in a generating set for 
C such that f( v,) = o. 
If ° is a face of C, then C is called strongly convex; this is the case precisely 
when C contains no one-dimensional JR.-subspaces, that is, when C n (-C) = {a}. 
If C is strongly convex, then its dual is n-dimensional (i.e., C* + ( -C*) = (JR.") *), 
regardless of the dimension of C. 
Let C be a rational cone in JR.n, and let C* be its dual, also rational. 
Lemma 11.2.5. The intersection C* n (zn) * is a finitely generated semigroup. 
Proof. Let Vj, ... , V,. E (zn) * be generators of C* and let K = {2: tiVj I ° :::; t, :::; 
I}. The intersection K n (zn) * is finite since K is compact. It suffices to show that 
K n (zn)* generates Se. For V ESe, write V = 2: riv, where ri 2 0, so ri = Tni + ti 
with Tni a nonnegative integer and ° :::; t, :::; 1. Then V = 2: TniVi + 2: tiv, with 
each Vi and 2:tiVi in Kn (zn)*.

The finitely generated semigroup C* n (Zrl)* is denoted Se.

of elements in (zn)* with all coordinates nonnegative, and is generated by 
er, ... ,e~, where el = (l,O, ... ,O), ... ,en = (0, ... ,0,1) E zn.

4. For the fourth cone in the previous list of examples, the associated semigroup 
algebra is

which has an orbifold Z2 singularity at the origin. Note that, for the cone 
C C Z2 generated by e'2 and e] -
2e'2, the associated semigroup algebra is 
which corresponds to a smooth toric variety. 
If we have an inclusion of rational cones C C C', then (C' )* c C*, hence 
q Se' 1 is a subalgebra of q Se]. It follows that we get a map 
to see this, first notice that, since nontrivial «:::-algebra homomorphisms C[Se] -+ C 
are uniquely determined by their kernels which are exactly the maximal ideals of 
qSe], we obtain a bijection 
Specm qSe] +----> Hom lC-alg(qSe], q \ {O} . 
Thus, by restricting homomorphisms from qSe] to qSe']' we get the asserted 
map.

Lemma 11.2.7. Let G and G' be rational cones. If G is a face of G', then the 
induced map Specm q Sc] ----+ Specm q SCI] is an open injection for the Zariski

In other words, if G is a face of G', then Specm C[Sel is an open subset of 
Specm qSCI].4 
Proof. If G is a face of G', then (see, for instance, [21]) there is v E SCI such that 
thus each element of C[Sel may be written in the form zO"-nv for some (J' E SCI 
and n E zt. The map Specm q Sc] ----+ Specm q SCI] is injective, since if two 
C-algebra homomorphisms qSc] ----+ C coincide on qScl], then they also coin-
cide on elements z-nv. The map Specrn q Sel ----+ Specrn q SCI] misses exactly 
the maximal ideals in qScl] containing the set {ZV}, since any C-algebra ho-
momorphism qScl] ----+ C which does not vanish on ZV extends to a nontrivial 
homomorphism h : qsc] ----+ C where h(z-V) = h(zv)-l, and if a C-algebra ho-
momorphism qScl]----+ C vanishes on zV, then any extension h: C[Se] ----+ C must 
vanish identically since h(l) = h(zVz-V) = h(zV)h(z-V) = O.

Definition 11.2.8. A fan in]R;n is a (nonempty) finite collection F of strongly convex 
rational cones such that 
• every face of every cone G E F belongs to F, 
• the intersection of any two cones from F is a face of both of them. 
The fan F is smooth if all of its cones are smooth. The support of F is the union 
IFI of all cones from F. The fan F is complete if IFI is the whole space. 
11.2.5 
Toric Varieties Associated to Fans 
Definition 11.2.9. The toric variety X F associated to a fan F in]R;n is the result of 
gluing the affine toric varieties Xc := Specm qsc] (for all G E F) by identifying 
Xc with the correponding Zariski open subset in XCI whenever G is a face of G'. 
Each affine chart Xc has a natural torus action defined as in the proof of 
Proposition II.2.1. Those actions are compatible under the identifications dictated 
by the face relations; hence there is a well-defined torus action on the variety 
X F . Moreover, X F contains indeed an open dense orbit of (c*)n as the open set 
corresponding to the zero cone in F: by strong convexity the zero cone is a face 
of every other cone, thus producing an open subset of each other affine piece, and 
the dual of the zero cone is the full set (]R;n) * , so the corresponding algebra is 
C[Zl' Z~l, ... ,Zn, Z~l] whose maximal spectrum is (c*)n . 
4This functorial property partly justifies working with cones and not their duals right away.

The variety X F is normal since it is glued out of normal affine varieties and 
normality is a local property. 
Exercise 53 
Show that: 
(a) The variety X F is compact if and only if the fan F is complete. 
(b) The variety X F is smooth if and only if every cone from F is smooth. 
As a consequence of the first part of the previous exercise, if F is a complete 
fan in lRn , then X F is a compactification of the torus (1C*)n

Classification of Normal Toric Varieties

Theorem 11.2.10. (Classification of normal toric varieties) 
Any normal toric 
variety X is equivalent to a variety of the form X F for some fan F in lRn, where 
n is the dimension of the torus acting on X. This fan is determined uniquely up 
to a transformation from GL(n; Z). 
For a proof of Theorem II.2.10, see for instance [41]. Thanks to this theorem, 
normal toric varieties are often defined in terms of fans. 
Proposition 11.2.11. Let F be a fan in lRn. Then the variety X F has finitely many 
orbits of the torus (c*)n, and there is a natural bijection between the (nonempty) 
cones in F and the (C*)n-orbits in X F , 
{ (C*)n-orbits } 
in X F 
where the orbit Oc has dimension equal to the codimension of C. Moreover, for 
cones C, C' E F we have 
OCI C Oc ¢=} C C C' . 
For a proof of Proposition 11.2.11, see again [41]. In the next lecture we state 
and prove the polytope analogue of this proposition.

Moment Polytopes 
We have seen that normal toric varieties are classified by fans. Most interesting 
for our purposes are those fans dual to polytopes: a fan associated to a polytope 
defines an equivariantly projective toric variety. Moreover, a polytope encodes 
other geometric information such as a symplectic form and an equivariant complex 
line bundle. We will relate the dual languages of polytopes and fans, and review 
the link to the symplectic approach. 
11.3.1 
Equivariantly Projective Toric Varieties 
Let X be a toric variety for a torus (c*)n. We say that X is equivariantly projective 
if there exists a (C*)n-equivariant embedding X '--+ lP'k for some k and some action 
of (C*)n on lP'k. 
Let A = {>, (1), ... ,),(k)} be a finite subset of zn. The first example of a toric 
variety in Section II.1.6 is 
[ 
.\(1) 
.\(k)] 
(* n 
X A : = closure of { W 
: ... : W 
I W E C ) } , 
that is, the closure of the (C*f'-orbit through [1 : ... : 1] for the action on lP'k-i 
defined by the weights A(i), i = 1, ... , k. The variety XA is clearly equivariantly 
embedded in lP'k-l, i.e., the action of the torus on X A extends to the whole ambient 
lP'k-l. The following theorem shows that, conversely, any equivariantly projective 
toric variety is equivalent to one of type XA for some finite set A c z:.n. 
Theorem 11.3.1. Let X be a toric variety which is (C*)n-equivariantly embedded 
in lP'R-l. Let Y be the minimal projective subspace in lP'R-l containing X, and 
let k - 1 be the (complex) dimension of Y. Then there exists a subset A c z:.n 
containing k elements and a (C*)n-equivariant isomorphism XA ---7 X extending 
to an equivariant projective isomorphism lP'k-l ---7 Y. 
Proof. Any action of (c*)n on lP'R-i by projective transformations can be lifted 
to a linear action on CR. Any linear action of (C*) n on C£ is diagonalizable, so in 
suitable coordinates it is given by a collection of weights A (i) E z:.n, i = 1, ... , jI 
such that W E (c*)n acts as multiplication by 
Pick a point Z = [Zl : ... : ze] E X lying on the open orbit of the torus. Let A c z:.n 
be the collection of those A (i) for which Zi i- O. Then the minimal projective 
subspace of lP'£-1 containing X is 
Y := {[Wi: ... : wp] E lP'€-1 I Zi = 0 =} Wi = O} . 

II. 3. Moment Polytopes

The dimension of Y is k -
1 where k = #A. We obtain a (C*)n-equivariant 
isomorphism by collecting the nonzero coordinates:

Example. Not all projective toric varieties are equivariantly projective. For lll-
stance, the nodal7 cubic curve X C W2 given by the equation 
is a (not normal) toric variety as its smooth part, 
X \ {[I: 0 : OJ} c:::: C* , 
is an open orbit for C*. For a reason why X does not admit an equivariant pro-
jective embedding see [22, p.169].

11.3.2 
Weight Polytopes 
Consider a torus (c*)n acting linearly on a complex vector space V and consider 
the associated action on the projectivization W(V). Let v be a nonzero vector in V, 
and let Ov be the closure in W(V) of the (C*)"-orbit through [v]. By construction, 
Ov is a toric variety equivariantly embedded in W(V). By Theorem II.3.1, the toric 
variety Ov is equivalent to XA", where Av is the finite subset of Z" prescribed as 
follows (adapting the proof of the previous theorem). 
For a given a weight A E Z" of (C*Y', the A-weight space of the (C*)"-
representation on V is the subspace 
VA = {v E V I w· v = wAv , Vw E (C*)"} 
The weight space decomposition of this representation is the isomorphism [11] 
cf. Exercise 9. Given a vector v E V, the component of v of weight A is the 
component VA E VA of v in the weight space decomposition. Set 
Av : = {A E zn I v A =I- O} . 
7The adjective nodal refers to having no singularities other than ordinary double points.

Exercise 56 
Show that the toric variety Ov is equivalent to XAv' 
Definition 11.3.2. The weight polytope Pv of the vector v E V \ {O} is the convex 
hull in JRn of the set Av described in the previous paragraph. 
Example. Given a finite set A c zn, its convex hull P in JRn is the weight polytope 
of the vector v = (1, ... ,1) for which the closure of the orbit through [v] is XA. <) 
11.3.3 Orbit Decomposition

Let A = {A (1), ... ,A (k)} be a finite subset of zn. The toric variety associated 
to A is (cf. Section ILL 6) 
),.(1) 
),.(k)

XA:= closure of {[w 
: ... : w 
] E IP' -
I W E (C*)n} . 
Proposition II.3.3. Let P be the convex hull in JRn of the set A above. Then there 
is a bijection between the (non empty) faces of the polytope P and the (C*)n-orbits 
in XA given by 
{
faces of } 
polytope P 
{ (iC*t-orbits } 
mXA 
where 
XO(F) = {[u] E X A I 'VA : u),. = ° 
{o} A ~ F} . 
The dimension of XO(F) is the dimension of F. Moreover, the closure X(F) of 
XO(F) is equivalent to the toric variety XAnF. If F and F' are two faces of P, 
then 
X(F') c X(F) {==} F' c F . 
Proof. For u = (Ul,"" Uk) E Ck such that [u] .- [Ul 
... : Uk] E XA, given 
A (i) E A we have that the A (iLcomponent of U is 
u),.(,) = (0, ... ,0, Ui, 0, ... ,0) . 
We first show that the correspondence is well-defined, i.e., that XO(F) is 
indeed an orbit. Of course, XO(F) is invariant as 

II.3. Moment Polytopes 
157 
Besides, any two [u], [u'] E XO(F) are related: to show that there exists indeed 
w E (c*)n such that U A = WAUN for all A E F, notice that U A = w~ and U A' = wi 
for some Wl, W2 E (c*)n, hence just take W = WlW2l. 
To prove injectivity, we need to show that 
Without loss of generality, we assume that there exists A E F' such that A tI- F. 
Therefore, if [u] E XO(F), then U A = 0, so that [u] tI- X°(F'). 
To prove surjectivity, we need to show that any [u] E XA belongs to some 
XO(F). We introduce the notation 
[VF] := [Vl : ... : Vk] such that {
Vi = 1 
Vi = 0 
if A(i) E F 
if A(i) tI- F ; 
in particular we have that [vp] = [1 : ... : 1]. By definition of XA, any [u] E XA is 
of the form 
[U] = lim f(z) . [vp]

Fans from Polytopes 
Let P c ]Rn be a polytope, and let f : ]Rn ----> ]R be a linear function. We denote 
by supp p f the supporting face of f in P, that is, the set of points in P where f 
achieves its minimum, as defined in the previous section. 
Definition 11.3.4. Let F be a face of a polytope P c ]Rn. The cone associated 
to F is the closure of the subset CF,P C (]Rn)* consisting of all linear functions 
f E (]Rn)* such that supppf = F. 
Exercise 57 
Show that OF,P is a convex cone, and that the collection of cones OF,? for all 
faces of P forms a complete fan. 
Hint: Read the description in terms of the dual polytope, after the next defini-
tion, and translate P so that it contains the origin in its interior. 
Definition 11.3.5. The fan of the polytope P is the collection :F p of the cones CF,P 
for all faces F of P. 
Suppose that the polytope P contains the origin in its interior. The fan of 
the polytope P coincides with the fan spanned by the faces of the dual polytope: 
P* := {f E (]Rn)* I f(v) ~ -1 , \:Iv E P} , 
that is, the collection of cones formed by the rays from the origin through the 
proper faces of P*, plus the origin. For instance, the dual of a cube is an octahe-
dron, so the fan of a cube has eight 3-dimensional triangular cones, together with 
all corresponding faces. Simple examples in ]R2 are:

As in Section H.l.6, consider a torus (c*)n acting linearly on a vector space 
V and the associated action on the projectivization IP'(V). Let v be a nonzero 
vector in V, and let Ov be the closure in IP'(V) of the (C*)n-orbit through [v]. 
Then the toric variety Ov is equivalent to XA v ' where Av = {).. E zn I VA =I=- o}. 
Proposition 11.3.6. The fan of the toric variety Ov equals the fan of the weight 
polytope Pv. In particular, dim Ov = dim Pv' 
For a proof of the previous proposition, see for instance [22, p.191] and [41]. 
Exercise 58 
Check that, in a similar way, we can define a fan of a convex polyhedron, 
though in this case the fan may not be complete. 
Remark. Let Specm qS] be the affine toric variety associated to the finitely gen-
erated semigroup S <;;; zn. We may assume that S generates zn as an abelian 
group. The variety Specm qS] is normal if and only if S = P n zn where P is the 
convex hull of Sin ]Rn. When Specm qS] is normal, its fan coincides with the fan 
of the convex polyhedron P. 
<:; 
11.3.5 
Classes of Toric Varieties 
Since all smooth varieties are normal, we restrict our attention to the universe of 
normal toric varieties, which are classified by fans. The affine ones correspond to 
fans consisting of the set of all faces of a single n-dimensional cone (see the remark 
at the end of the previous section). The compact ones correspond to complete fans. 
The equivariantly projective ones are necessarily of the form X A for some set of the 
form A = Zk n P where P is a polytope.8 Since projective spaces are compact (or 
because fans of polytopes are complete), any equivariantly projective toric variety 
is compact. 
Relation between these classes: 
• Not all equivariantly projective normal toric varieties are smooth. To see a 
nonsmooth (i.e., singular) one just take the fan of a simple rational nons-
mooth polytope. For instance, the triangle on the next page fails the smooth-
ness condition at the top vertex. 
8When A C Zk is finite yet not of the form Zk n P for some polytope P, the corresponding 
XA is not normal, and its normalization is XA', where A' = Zk n pi and pi is the convex hull 
of A. 

II. 3. Moment Polytopes 
161 
• Not all compact normal toric varieties are equivariantly projective, though 
in (complex) dimensions 1 and 2 this is always the case. Equivalently, not all 
complete fans come from polytopes in the sense of Definition II.3.5, though 
in dimensions 1 and 2 they do. There are plenty of complete fans in lR3 which 
do not come from polytopes. For example, the collection of cones over the 
subdivision below of the boundary of the tetrahedron is not associated to 
any polytope [21, 41] . 
• Of course, not all normal toric varieties are compact - any affine toric variety 
is not compact; more generally, any fan which is not complete corresponds 
to a noncom pact toric variety. 
11.3.6 
Symplectic vs. Algebraic 
A lattice polytope in lRn is a polytope whose vertices belong to zn. 
Suppose that ~ is an n-dimensional polytope which is both Delzant and 
lattice. As a Delzant polytope, it is the moment polytope of a symplectic toric 
manifold (M6.,w6., l'n,/.L6.), by Deb:ant's construction. 
On the other hand, consider the set of integral points in ~: 

162 
II. Algebraic Viewpoint 
where k := #A is the number of such points. The convex hull of A is obviously 
~. Then the associated variety X A is a toric variety for (c*)n. The variety XA is 
smooth and compact because the fan of the polytope ~ is smooth and complete, 
and XA is connected because it is the closure of a (C*)n-orbit. Moreover, by 
definition XA is equivariantly embedded in jp'k-1, 
i : XA '---+ jp'k-1 , 
and the restriction of the (C*)n-action to its real subgroup 
is effective, because the action of (c*)n was already effective. 
Recall that projective spaces have canonical symplectic structures provided 
by the Fubini-Study forms. For later convenience, we equip jp'k-1 with the sym-
plectic structure -2wFS • Since X A is a complex sub manifold of jp'k-1 and wFS is a 
Kahler form, we obtain that the restriction 
is nondegenemte, hence a symplectic form on XA. The structure WA is ,[,n-invariant 
because wFS is '['n-invariant. 
We will check that the '['n-action on X A is in fact hamiltonian by exhibiting 
a moment map. 
The action of ,[,n on (C k , -2wo) by 
is hamiltonian with moment map

is hamiltonian with moment map 
¢(z) = IlzW - 1 . 
The manifold (jp'k-1, - 2wFS ) is the symplectic reduction of (C k , - 2wo) with respect 
to the S1-action and the moment map ¢. Since the Sl-action commutes with 

II. 3. Moment Polytopes 
163 
the action of 1['n and preserves the moment map Ii, we conclude that the 1['n_ 
action and Ii descend to the quotient (lP'k-l, - 2wFS ). Therefore, the 1['n-action on 
(lP'k-1, -2wFS ) by

The image of p, is the convex hull of A, i.e., is the polytope ~. 
As the symplectic sub manifold (XA,WA) is 1['n-invariant, the restriction of p, 
to XA produces a moment map for the restricted action. We claim that the image 
of P,IXA is still ~, so that the two constructions (Delzant's and the toric variety) 
yield equivalent symplectic toric manifolds. 
Since p,(XA) is a Delzant polytope, it suffices to show that each vertex of ~ 
is in p,(XA)' Let A (R) be a vertex, and let a = (a1' ... ,an) E zn be such that the 
restriction to ~ of the linear function fa : IR" ---) IR, foC)...) := a· A, achieves its 
minimum in A (f). Consider the map of a punctured disk to the torus 
f: {z E C* Ilzl < c} -+ (C*)n 
f(z) = (z"', ... ,za,,). 
By definition of X A , we have that

lim [(f(z))

Hence, by continuity of p" we conclude that 
The coincidence of the two constructions allows to see that a symplectic toric 
manifold is Kahler, because it inherits a compatible invariant complex structure 
from its equivariant embeddings into projective spaces. 
Remark. Not all toric varieties admit symplectic forms. A compact normal toric 
variety admits a symplectic form if and only if its fan comes from some polytope. 
Changing the cohomology class of the symplectic form corresponds to changing 
the lengths of the edges of the polytope. The size of the faces of a polytope cannot 
be recovered from the fan, where only the combinatorics of the faces is encoded. 
Hence, the fan does not give the cohomology class of the symplectic form.

Geodesic Flows and 
Contact Toric Manifolds 
Eugene Lerman 

Foreword 
The main theme of these notes is the topological study of contact toric manifolds, 
a relatively new class of manifolds that I find very interesting. A motivation for 
studying these manifolds comes from completely integrable systems {h,· .. , In} 
on punctured cotangent bundles where each function Ii is homogeneous of degree 
1 (one can think of Ii's as symbols of first order pseudo-differential operators, but 
this is not essential). A punctured cotangent bundle is a symplectic cone whose 
base is naturally a contact manifold (this is explained in detail in Chapter I.2). This 
observation leads to studying completely integrable systems on contact manifolds, 
whatever those are. 
The simplest (symplectic) completely integrable systems are the ones with 
global action-angle coordinates. The next simplest case is that of Hamiltonian 
torus actions. If the phase space is compact one ends up with (compact) symplec-
tic toric manifolds. This is the theme of Ana Cannas's lectures delivered at the 
summer school. The corresponding case in the contact category is that of compact 
toric manifolds. 
We will use the excuse of studying completely integrable geodesic flows with 
homogeneous integrals to introduce various ideas essential for the classification 
of contact and symplectic toric manifolds. More specifically we will discuss in 
these notes contact moment maps, slices for group actions, sheaves and Cech 
cohomology, orbifolds and Morse theory on orbifolds. 

Chapter I 
From toric integrable geodesic 
flows to contact toric manifolds 
1.1 
Introduction 
We start with an innocuous sounding problem. 
Problem 
Consider the cotangent bundle of the n-torus minus the zero section 
T*1[''' '-... O. That is, consider the manifold 
M = {(q,p) E IRnllZ" x IRn I p =1= O}. 
Suppose further that the torus G = 1[''' = IRn lIZ" acts 011 M effectively 
and preserves the standard symplectic form w = L dp, /\ dqi (i.e., the action is 
symplectic). Suppose further that the action of G commutes with dilations, i.e., 
the action p of IR on M given by 
Is the action of G necessarily free? 
Remark 1.l. 
l. Recall that an action of the group G on a manifold M is effec-
tive if the only element of G that fixes all the points of M is the identity. 
2. There is an "obvious" action of 1['n on M which has the above properties 
and is free -
it is the lift of left multiplication: 
a· (q,p) = (aq,p), 
where a E 1['n, (q, p) E M. The issue is whether an arbitrary action of 1['n 
which is effective, symplectic and commutes with dilations is necessarily free.

1. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
3. We will see later (Proposition 1.13) that an action of a Lie group G on a punc-
tured cotangent bundle which is symplectic and commutes with dilations is 
necessarily Hamiltonian. That is, there is a moment map <I> : M ----> g*. Recall 
the definition of the moment map for a symplectic action of a Lie group G 
on a symplectic manifold (M, w): for any vector X in the Lie algebra g of G 
where (-,.) : g* x g ----> JR;. is the canonical pairing and X M is the vector field 
induced by the infinitesimal action of X: XM(X) = 1tlt=o (exptX)· x. 
The problem is due to John Toth and Steve Zelditch [TZ]. The context is 
classical and quantum integrability of geodesic flows. Recall that for a manifold 
Q with a Riemannian metric g the corresponding geodesic flow is the flow on 
the cotangent bundle T*Q of the Hamiltonian vector field X h of the function 
h = hg E COO(T*Q) which is the square root of the energy: 
for all q E Q, p E T;Q. Here g* denotes the inner product on the cotangent 
bundle T*Q ----> Q dual to the inner product g; g* is the so called dual metric. For 
an analyst the function h is the principal symbol of the square root of the Laplace 
operator vi'K defined by the metric g. A precise definition of vi'K will play no role 
in these notes. For a Riemannian geometer it's important that the integral curves 
of the vector field X h project down to geodesics on the manifold Q. Toth and 
Zelditch were interested in the meaning of Loo bounded ness of the L 2-normalized 
eigenfunctions of vi'K. They observed that the question is easier if vi'K is quantum 
completely integrable. Again, it will not be important to us as to what that means 
precisely. What will matter is that quantum integrability of vi'K implies (classical) 
homogeneous complete integrability of the geodesic flow. Namely, it implies that 
there exist functions h = h, 12, ... , In E COO(T*Q" 0), n = dimQ,l such that 
1. the functions h, ... , In are functionally independent on an open dense set 
U c T*Q " 0, i.e., dh 1\ .. . 1\ dIn i=- 0 on U; 
2. the functions Poisson commute with each other: {h Ij} = 0 for all 1 ::; i, j ::; 
n; 
3. the functions Ii are homogeneous of degree 1: 
for all A E JR;., where PA : T*Q " 0 ----> T*Q " 0 again denotes the dilation 
PA(q,P) = (q,eAp), q E Q, p E T;Q. 
IT*Q ,,0 denotes the punctured cotangent bundle of Q, that is, T*Q with the zero section 
deleted. 

1.1. Introduction 
181 
Exercise 1.2. Suppose f is a smooth function on the punctured cotangent bundle 
T*Q"-° 
of a manifold Q which is homogeneous of degree 1, i.e., p~f = e" f for all 
dilations p". Show that its Hamiltonian vector field X f (relative to the standard 
symplectic structure on T*Q) satisfies 
Conclude that the flow of X h commutes with dilations. 
Given a completely integrable system, we know that locally around any 
generic point there exist action-angle variables. Toth and Zelditch observed that 
things are considerably simpler if the action-angle variables are global. Then there 
exists an effective action of a torus ,][,n = lRn jzn on T*Q"-O preserving the function 
h and the symplectic form, and commuting with dilations p". Toth and Zelditch 
proved (op. cit.): 
Theorem 1.3. Suppose that the Lie group G = ,][,n acts effectively on M = T*']['n ,,-0, 
preserving the standard symplectic form and the function hg (q, p) = (g; (p, p)) 1 /2 
for some metric g on ']['n. Suppose further the action commutes with dilations. If 
the action of G is free then the metric g is fiat, that is, 
for some constants gij (with gij = gji)' 
The eigenfunctions of a flat metric Laplace operator on a torus are well understood. 
Let us now go back to the problem. The answer to the question is yes [LS]: 
Theorem 104. Suppose the Lie group G = ,][,n = lR" jzn acts effectively on the 
punctured cotangent bundle M = T*']['n "-° preserving the standard symplectic 
form and commuting with dilations p" : M ----7 M, p,,(q,p) = (q, e"p). Then the 
action of G is free. 
The main purpose of these notes is to explain why Theorem 1.4 is true. I 
will now try to motivate the proof and to put it in a broader context. As was 
remarked previously (Remark 1.1(3)), the action of the torus G on M = T*']['n "-° 
is Hamiltonian. By the dimension count the manifold M together with its natural 
symplectic structure and the action of G is a symplectic toric manifold. Recall the 
definition. 
Definition 1.5. A symplectic toric manifold is a triple (M, w, <I> : M ----7 fl*) where 
M is a manifold, w is a symplectic form on M, and <I> is a moment map for an 
effective Hamiltonian action of a torus G on (M, w) satisfying 2 dim G = dim M. 
Compact symplectic toric manifolds are well understood thanks to a classifi-
cation theorem of Delzant [D], which says that all such manifolds are classified by 
the images of the corresponding moment maps. Note that by the Atiyah-Guillemin-
Sternberg convexity theorem [A, GS1], the images are convex rational polytopes. 

182 
1. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
Delzant proved that in the toric case the polytopes are simple2 and addition-
ally satisfy certain integrality conditions. Finally any simple polytope satisfying 
the integrality conditions occurs as an image of the moment map for a compact 
symplectic toric manifold. 
Exercise 1.6. Show that a Hamiltonian torus action on a compact symplectic man-
ifold is never free. Hint: any smooth function on a compact manifold has a critical 
point (in fact it has at least two - a maximum and a minimum). 
The manifold M = T*'[n "" 0 we are interested in is not compact. Worse, 
we will see that the corresponding moment map 1) : M --+ g* is homogeneous 
(Proposition I.13): 
for all m E M, A E R This is a bit of bad news - Morse theory is an essential 
ingredient in the proof of the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem and 
hence of Delzant's classification. Morse functions on a noncompact manifold which 
are not bounded either above or below are in practice impossible to work with. 
On the other hand, because of homogeneity, the moment map descends to the 
quotient of M by the action of R The quotient is diffeomorphic to the co-sphere 
bundle s*'[n := {(q,p) E T*'[n I g;(p,p) = I} for some dual metric g*. Since 
s*'[n is odd-dimensional, it is not a symplectic manifold. 3 
It is also easy to see in an example that the map induced on S*'[Tl by a 
homogeneous moment map on T*'[n "" 0 behaves rather strangely if one is used to 
symplectic moment maps: 
Example 1. 7. Consider the standard action of G = ,[n on the cotangent bundle 
T*,[n, the lift of the left multiplication: 
a· (q,p) = (a· q,p), 
The corresponding moment map 1) : T*G = G x g* --+ g* is given by 1)(q,p) = p. 
Fix the standard metric on G and identify the dual of the Lie algebra g* with IRn. 
Then the co-sphere bundle S* G is ,[n X sn-l. The map 1)' = 1) I S* G : S* G --+ g* 
is also given by 1)'(q,p) = p. Note that for any nonzero vector X E 9 the function 
(1)', X) has exactly two critical manifolds even though the action of G on S* G is 
free! 
Compare this with the symplectic situation where critical points of compo-
nents of moment maps are points with nontrivial isotropy groups. What are we 
dealing with? We are dealing with moment maps for group actions on contact 
manifolds. 
2 A polytope in an n-dimensional real vector space is simple if there are exactly n edges meeting 
at each vertex. Equivalently, all the supporting hyperplanes are in general position. Thus a cube 
and a tetrahedron are simple and an octahedron is not . 
.3The manifold S*1I''' is contact. See next Chapter and the Appendix. 

I.l. Introduction 
183 
We finish the section by sketching a strategy for our proof of Theorem 1.4. 
The effective action of the torus G on M = T*']['n " 0 descends to an effective 
action on the quotient B = s*']['n of M by dilations. The action of G on B 
preserves a contact structure ~ (see Definition 1.21 below) making (B,~) into a 
compact connected contact toric G-manifold (c.c.c.t.m., see Definition 1.37). We 
then study all c.c.c.t.m.'s with a non-free torus actions and argue that none of 
them can have the homotopy type of B = ']['n X sn-l. 

184 
I. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
1.2 
Symplectic cones and contact manifolds 
In this section we define symplectic cones, contact forms and contact structures. 
Given a symplectic cone we show how to construct the corresponding contact 
manifold, and conversely, given a contact manifold we construct the corresponding 
symplectic cone. Thus symplectic manifolds and contact manifolds are "the same 
thing." Next we show that a symplectic action of a Lie group on a symplectic cone 
induces a contact action on the corresponding contact manifold. This will give us 
tools to set up a proof of Theorem 1.4 as a study of contact toric manifolds. The 
material in this section is fairly well known. We now start by defining symplectic 
cones. 
Definition L8. A symplectic manifold (M, w) is a symplectic cone if 
• the manifold M is a principal ffi. bundle over some manifold B, called the 
base of the cone, and 
• the action of the real line ffi. expands the symplectic form exponentially. That 
is, p;w = eAw, where PA denotes the diffeomorphism define by A E ffi.. 
Definition L9. Recall that a map f : X ----+ Y between two topological spaces is 
proper if the preimage of a compact set under f is compact. An action of a Lie 
group G on a manifold M is proper if the map G x M 3 (g, m) f---* (g. m, m) E 
M x M is proper. 
By a theorem of Palais [P] the quotient M / G of a manifold M by a free 
proper action of a Lie group G is a manifold and the orbit map M ----+ M / G makes 
M into a principal G bundle (see also Remark IIL5 below). It follows that if a 
symplectic manifold (M, w) has a complete vector field X with the following two 
properties: 
1. the action of ffi. induced by the flow of X is proper, and 
2. the Lie derivative of the symplectic form w with respect to the vector field 
X is again w: Lxw = w, 
then (M, w) is a symplectic cone relative to the induced action of R This gives us 
an equivalent definition of a symplectic cone. 
Definition LIO. A symplectic cone is a triple (M, w, X) where M is a manifold, w 
is a symplectic form on M, X is a vector field on M generating a proper action 
of the reals ffi. such that Lxw = w. 
Example 1.11. Let (V, Wv ) be a symplectic vector space. The manifold M = V" {O} 
is a symplectic cone with the action of ffi. given by PA(V) = eAv. Clearly p;wv = 
eAwv. The base is a sphere. 

1.2. Symplectic cones and contact manifolds 
185 
Example 1.12. Let Q be a manifold. Denote the cotangent bundle of Q with the 
zero section deleted by T*Q " O. There is a natural free action of the reals IR on 
the manifold M ;= T*Q" 0 given by dilations p>-.(q,p) = (q, e>-'p). It expands the 
standard symplectic form on the cotangent bundle exponentially. Thus T*Q " 0 
is naturally a symplectic cone. The base is the co-sphere bundle S*Q. 
Proposition 1.13. Suppose (M, w, X) is a symplectic cone and suppose a Lie group 
G acts on M preserving the symplectic form wand the expanding vector field X. 
Then the action of G on the symplectic manifold (M, w) is Hamiltonian. Moreover 
we may choose the moment map <I> ; M -7 g* to be homogeneous of degree 1, i.e., 
for all A E IR and m E M. Here P>-. denotes the action of IR generated by X, that 
is, the time A flow of X. 
Proof. Note first that since Lxw = wand since dw = 0, it follows from Cartan's 
formula (Lxw = L(X)dw + dL(X)W) that d(L(X)W) = w. Since the action of G 
preserves X and w, it preserves the contraction L(X)W. Therefore for any vector A 
in the Lie algebra 9 of G we have LAM (L(X)W) = 0, where AM as before denotes 
the vector field on M induced by A. Therefore 
and consequently 
We conclude that the map <I> ; !vI -7 g* defined by 
is a moment map for the action of G on (M, w).

I. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
Definition 1.15. A I-form a on a manifold B is a contact form if the following two 
conditions hold: 
1. ab #- 0 for all points b E B. Hence ~:= kera = {(b,v) E TB I ab(v) = O} is 
a vector subbundle of the tangent bundle T B. 
2. dal.;- is a symplectic structure on the vector bundle ~ ---+ B (i.e. dabl';-b is 
nondegenerate) . 
Remark 1.16. 
1. If ~ ---+ B is a symplectic vector bundle, then the dimension of 
its fibers is necessarily even. Hence if a manifold B has a contact form, then 
B is odd-dimensional. 
2. A I-form a on 2n + 1 dimensional manifold B is contact if and only if the 
form a 1\ (da)n is never zero, i.e., it is a volume form. [Prove this]. 
Example 1.17. The I-form a = dz + x dy on lR3 is a contact form: a 1\ da = 
dz 1\ dx 1\ dy. 
Example 1.18. Let B = lR X ']['2. Denote the coordinates by t, (h and (h respectively. 
The I-form a = cos t del + sin t de2 is contact. [Check this.] 
Lemma 1.19. Suppose a is a contact form on a manifold B. Then for any positive 
function f on B the i-form fa is also contact. 
Proof. Note first that since f is nowhere zero, ker fa = ker a. Thus to show 
that fa is contact, it is enough to check that d(f a) 1.;- is nondegenerate, where ~ = 
kera = ker fa. Now d(fa) = df I\a+ fda and a 1.;- = O. Therefore d(fa) I.; = fdal.;-. 
But f is nowhere zero and dal.; is nondegenerate by assumption. Thus d(fa)l.;- is 
nondegenerate. 
0 
Definition 1.20. We define the conformal class of a I-form a on a manifold B to 
be the set [a] = {eha I h E Coo (B)}, that is, the set of all I-forms obtained from 
a by multiplying it by a positive function. 
Thus if a I-form a on a manifold B is contact, then its conformal class 
consists of contact forms all defining the same subbundle ~ of the tangent bundle 
of B. 
Definition 1.21. A (co-orient able) contact structure ~ on a manifold B is a sub-
bundle of the tangent bundle T B of the form ~ = ker a for some contact form 
a. 
A co-orientation of a contact structure ~ is a choice of a conformal class of 
contact forms defining the contact structure. 
Remark 1.22. More generally a contact structure on a manifold B is a subbundle ~ 
of the tangent bundle T B such that for every point x E B there is a contact I-form 
a defined in a neighborhood of x with ker a = 
~. There exist contact structures 
which are not co-orient able. For such structures ~ a one-form a with ker a = 
~ 
exists only locally. IN THESE NOTES WE WILL ONLY DEAL WITH CO-ORIENTABLE 
CONTACT STRUCTURES. 

1.2. Symplectic cones and contact manifolds

Exercise 1.23. Let (3 be a nowhere zero I-form on a manifold B and let rJ = ker (3. 
Let rJ° ---+ B denote the annihilator of rJ in T* B: the fiber of rJ° at b E B is the 
vector space 
rJ~ = {p E T; B I plrlb = O}. 
Show that (3 is a nowhere zero section of real line bundle rJ° ---+ B. Show that any 
other nowhere zero section (3' of rJ° ---+ B is of the form (3' = f (3 for some nowhere 
zero function f on B. 
Conclude that a contact structure ~ is co-orient able if and only if the punc-
tured real line bundle C '" 0 has two components (0 of course denotes the zero 
section). Show that a choice of co-orientation of ~ is the same as a choice of a 
component ~+ of the punctured bundle ~o '" O. 
Definition 1.24. Let (BJ, ~ J = ker ad and (B2' 6 = ker (2) be two co-oriented 
contact manifolds. A diffeomorphism <p : B1 ---+ B2 is a contactomorphism if the 
differential d<p maps 6 to 6 preserving the co-orientations. That is, <p*a2 = fa1 
for some positive function j.1 
Definition 1.25. An action of a Lie group G on a manifold B preserves a contact 
structure ~ and its co-orientation if for every element a E G the corresponding 
diffeomorphism aB : B ---+ B is a contactomorphism. We will also say that the 
action of G on (B, 0 is a contact action. 
Definition 1.26. Let a be a contact form on a manifold B. The Reeb vector field 
Ye, of a is the unique vector field satisfying L(Ye,)da = 0 and a(Ye,) = 1. 
Exercise 1.27. Why does the definition of the Reeb vector field makes sense? 
Remark 1.28. The Reeb vector field depends strongly on the contact form. And 
it is not just its magnitude: if a is a contact form and Ye, is its Reeb vector field, 
then there is no reason for L(Y,,)d(fa) = 0 where f is a nowhere zero function. 
Exercise 1.29. Compute the Reeb vector field of the contact form a = dz + x dy 
on ]R:l. 
Exercise 1.30. Compute the Reeb vector field of the contact form a of Exam-
ple L18: a = costdB1 + sintdB2 on B =]R X ']['2. 
Symplectic cones and contact manifolds are intimately related: 
Theorem 1.31. Suppose a compact connected Lie group G acts effectively on a 
symplectic cone (M, w, X) preserving the symplectic form wand the expanding 
vector field X. Then G induces an effective action on the base B of the cone making 
the projection w : M ---+ B G-equivariant. Moreover, the base B has a natural co-
oriented contact structure ~, and the induced action of G on B preserves a contact 
form a defining~. In particular the action of G on (B,O is contact. 
'ISince dcp(~l) = 6, the lift (jJ : T* Bl --+ T* B2 of cp maps ~f to ~~. "dcp preserves the 
co-orientation" means that (jJ maps (6)'t- to (6) 'I- (cf. Exercise 1. 23). 

188 
I. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
We start the proof of Theorem 1.31 with an observation that the action of G 
on M descends to an effective action of G on the base B making the projection 
TN: M -> B G-equivariant. Next we prove: 
Proposition 1.32. Any principal IR-bundle IR -> M ..:':, B is trivial. 
Proof. The proposition is true because the real line is contractible. Here is an 
elementary argument. Note first that if s : B -> M is a (local) section of TN : M -> 
Band f E C= (B) is a function, then S - f makes sense; it is again a (local) section 
of TN : M ----+ B. To prove that a principal bundle is trivial it is enough to construct 
a global section. To this end choose an open cover {U"'} of B such that for each U'" 
there is a section Sa : U a ----+ M. Choose a partition of unity T", subordinate to the 
cover {Ua }. Two sections of a principal IR-bundle differ by real-valued function. 
Thus by abuse of notation on an intersection Ua n U(3, Sa -
S(3 is a real-valued 
function. Now define for each index a 
S~ = S(3 -
L 
T",(S(3 - sa). 
a#(3 
Then on an intersection U a n U (3 
S~ - s~ = (S(3 - L. Ta(S(3 - sa)) - (s, - L 
T",(S, - sa)) 
a#8 
a#, 
= S(3 - S, -
( L . . Ta(S(3 - S,)) + T(3(S, - S(3) - T,(S6 - S,) 
",#8., 
= S(3 - S, - (LTa)(S(3 - S,) = O. 
a 
Therefore the collection of local sections {s~} defines a global section of TN : M ----+ 
B. Consequently the bundle is trivial. 
D 
Thus any symplectic cone is of the form B x IR where B = M JIR is an odd-
dimensional manifold. 
Lemma 1.33. Let (M,w, X) be a symplectic cone, let B be its base and let TN: M ----+ 
B denote the projection. Pick a trivialization cp : B x IR ----+ M. Then cp* w = d( et a) 
where t is a coordinate on IR and a is a contact form on B. Conversely, if a is 
contact form on B then (B x IR, d( et a), fit) is a symplectic cone. 
Proof. By Proposition 1.32 the principal IR bundle TN : M ----+ B is trivial. Choose 
a trivialization M ':':' B x IR. Under this identification the vector field X becomes 
a 
at· 
Since dw = 0 and Lxw = w, dL(X)W = w (c.f. proof of Proposition 1.13). Let 
{3 = L(X)W. Then L(X){3 = 0 and Lx{3 = dL(X){3 + L(X)d{3 = 0 + L(X)W = {3. 

I.2. Symplectic cones and contact manifolds 
189 
Hence for any point (b, t) E B x JR 
P(b,t) = et P(b,O)' 
Since L(X(b, O))P(b,O) = 0 it follows that P(b,O) = ab for a I-form a on B. It remains 
to show that a is contact. For this it suffices to show that al\(da)d is nowhere zero, 
where d = 
~ dimM -
1. Now w = d(eta) is symplectic. Hence wd+l is nowhere 
vanishing. Now wd+l = (et(dt 1\ a + da))d+l = etddt 1\ a 1\ (da)d. Hence a 1\ (da)d 
is nowhere vanishing. 
Conversely suppose a is a contact I-form on B. Let w = d(eta) and let 
X = ft. Then Lxw = d(L(ft)d(eta)) = d(L(ft)(etdtl\a+etda)) = d(eta+O) = w. 
It remains to check that w is nondegenerate. For any (b, t) E B x JR, the tangent 
space T(b,t)(B x JR) decomposes as T(b,t)(B x JR) = kerab EB JRYa(b) EB JR where Ya 
is the Reeb vector field of a (cf. Definition 1.26). Since a is contact dablkerab is 
nondegenerate. The restriction dt 1\ ab to JRYa(b) EB JR is nondegenerate as well. 
Hence w = et (dt 1\ a + da) is nondegenerate. This proves that (B x JR, d( et a), ft) 
is a symplectic cone. 
D 
Exercise 1.34. Let (M, w, X) be a symplectic cone, let B be its base and let LV : 
M -+ B denote the JR-orbit map. Pick a global section s : B -+ M of LV : M -+ B 
and let a = S*(L(X)W). Show that a is a contact form on B. Show that it is 
the same contact form that the proof of Lemma 1.33 would produce from the 
trivialization lP : B x JR -+ M, lP(b, t) = pt(s(b)). Here Pt : M -+ M denotes the 
action of JR. 
Remark 1.35. Different choices of trivializations lP of LV : M -+ B give rise to 
different contact forms on B. However, they all define the same contact structure 
~ on the base B. Intrinsically ~ can be defined as follows: for a point bE B, 
(1.1) 
It is not hard to check that ~ is well-defined. First note that JR acts transitively 
on the fiber LV~l(b). Second observe that for any A E JR we have p;(L(X)W) = 
eA(L(X)W), and hence dpA(ker(L(X)w)m) = (ker(L(X)w)p),(m). Here again Pt : 
M -+ M denotes the action of lR. 
It follows that the action of G on B induced by an action of G on the 
symplectic cone LV : M -+ B preserves the contact structure ~ defined by (1.1). 
Since G is connected and since the identity map preserves the co-orientation of ~, 
all the other elements of G also preserve the co-orientation. 
It remains to show that there is a G-invariant I-form a with ker a = ~. By 
Lemma 1.33 a choice of a trivialization of LV : M -+ B gives us a I-form a on B 
with ker a = C but this form need not be G-invariant. It is only G-invariant if the 
trivialization is G-equivariant. Therefore we proceed as follows. 
Lemma 1.36. Suppose a compact Lie group G acts on a manifold B preserving a 
(co-oriented) contact structure ~ = ker a for some i-form a. Then there exists a 
G-invariant i-form 0: with ker 0: = ~. 

190 
I. From toric integrable geodesic flows to contact toric manifolds 
Proof. For every a E G the corresponding diffeomorphism aB : B --+ B is a 
contactomorphism. Hence (aB)*a = faa for some positive function fa depending 
smoothly on a. Define a new contact form a to be the average of a over the action 
of G: 
ab = fa ((aB)*ah da = fa (fa(b)ab) da = (fa fa(b) da) ab 
for all b E B. Here da is a bi-invariant measure on G normalized so that Ie da = 1. 
Since fa > 0 for all a E G, the integral (Ie Ja(b) da) is positive and a is indeed 
nowhere zero. 
D 
From now on we will always assume that whenever a group actions preserves 
a contact structure it also preserves a contact form defining this structure. 
This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.31. It follows from the Theorem that 
if an n-torus G acts effectively on the punctured cotangent bundle M = T*'fn " 0 
preserving the symplectic form and commuting with dilations then it acts on the 
quotient B = M /YJ. c:::: S*'fn preserving the corresponding contact structure. Note 
that 2dimG = dimB + 1. 
Definition 1.37. An effective action of a torus G on a manifold B preserving a 
contact structure ~ is completely integrable if 2 dim G = dim B + 1. 
A contact toric G-manifold is a co-oriented contact manifold with a com-
pletely integrable action of a torus G. 
We are now in position to reduce Theorem 1.4 to a statement about contact 
toric manifolds. Consider again the action of G = 'fn on M = T*'fn " 0 preserving 
the symplectic form and commuting with dilations. As was remarked previously M 
is a symplectic cone over B = S*'fn = 'fn X sn-l. By Theorem 1.31 the action of 
G on M induces an effective action on B. Moreover B has a G-invariant contact 
structure ~ making (B,O into a compact connected contact toric G-manifold. 
Clearly if the action of G on B is free then the original action of G on M was free 
as well. Therefore a proof of Theorem 1.4 reduces to 
Theorem 1.38. Let (B, ~ = ker a) be a compact connected contact toric G-manifold 
and suppose the action of G is not free. Then B is not homotopy equivalent to 
'fn X sn-l, n = dim G. 
The rest of the notes will be occupied with a proof of Theorem 1.38. The 
proof uses heavily contact moment maps which are discussed in the next chapter. 
We end this section with a partial converse to Theorem 1.31. 
We have seen that given a contact form a on a manifold B the form d(eta) 
on B x YJ. is symplectic. The pair (B x YJ., d( et a)) is called the symplectization5 of 
(B, a). It is clearly a symplectic cone. 
Different contact forms on B give rise to different symplectic forms on B x R 
However there is a symplectic cone that depends only on the contact structure 
5 Sometimes (B x ]Fl., d( et a)) is called the sympiectification of (B, a). 

I. 2. Symplectic cones and contact manifolds 
191 
~ = ker a (and its co-orientation) and not on a particular choice of a contact form: 
Let ~~ denote the component of C" 0 giving ~ its co-orientation (cf. Exercise 1.23). 
It is not hard to check that ~~ is a symplectic submanifold of the cotangent bundle 
T* B with its standard symplectic structure. The action of lR. on T* B " 0 by 
dilations preserves ~~ and makes it into a symplectic cone. A section (3 of ~~ -4 B 
is a contact form (3 on B with ~ = ker (3. The form (3 defines a trivialization 
tps : B x lR. -4 ~~, tps(b, t) = et (3b. The map tp(3 pulls back the symplectic form on 
~~ to d(et(3). 
Finally given a symplectic cone (M, w, X) with the base B, the orbit map 
w : M -4 B and the induced contact structure ~ on B, there is an lR. equivariant 
symplectomorphism tp : M -4 ~~ defined as follows: for a point m E M let tp(m) 
be the covector in T~(m)B such that 
for all v E Tw(m)B and a section s of w : M -4 B. 
The discussion above can be summarized as: 
Lemma 1.39. Let (B,~ = kera) be a contact manifold, let ~~ be a component of 
~o ,,0, the annihilator of ~ in T* B minus the zero section. The principallR. bundle 
~~ -4 B is a symplectic cone. 
If (M, w, X) is a symplectic cone with the base B and ~ is the induced contact 
structure on B, then ~~ is isomorphic to (M,w,X) as a symplectic cone. 

Chapter II 
Contact group actions and 
contact moment maps 
Moment maps exist in the category of contact group actions. In fact moment maps 
exist for all contact actions. This is because a contact form defines a bijection 
between contact vector fields and smooth functions. 
Definition ILL A vector field X on a contact manifold (B, ~ = ker a) is contact if 
its flow CPt consists of contactomorphisms. In particular dcpt(O c ( Hence for any 
section v of the bundle ~ ---) B, the Lie bracket [X, v] is again a section of ~ ---) B. 
Thus for a contact action of a Lie group G on (B, 0 the vector fields induced 
by elements of the Lie algebra 9 of G are contact. 
Exercise 11.2. Prove that a Reeb vector field is contact. More generally prove that 
a vector field X on a contact manifold (B, ~ = ker a) is contact if and only if 
Lxa = ha for some function h (h can have zeros). 
A choice of a contact form on a contact manifold (B,~) identifies contact 
vector fields with smooth functions. 
Proposition 11.3. Let (B, ~ = ker a) be a contact manifold. The linear map from 
contact vector fields to smooth functions given by X f-+ fX := a(X) is one-to-one 
and onto. 
Proof. Note that the Reeb vector field Ya corresponds to the function 1. For any 
vector field X on B the vector field X - a(X)Yc, is in the kernel of a, which is 
the contact distribution ( Since dal.;- is non-degenerate, X -
a(X)Y;~ is uniquely 
determined by L(X - a(X)Ya)(dal.;-). 
For any section v of ~ ---) B and any vector field X we have 
0= LxO = Lx(a(v)) = (Lxa)(v) + a([X, v]). 

194 
II. Contact group actions and contact moment maps 
Assume now that X is contact. Then a([X, v]) = O. Therefore, by Cartan's formula 
0= (dt(X)a + t(X)da)(v). 
Hence for any section v of~, da(X,v) = -d(a(X))(v) = -dfx (v). And, of course, 
da(X, v) = da(X - fXy", , v) for all v. We conclude that 
(ILl ) 
for any contact vector field X. Thus if X is contact, its component in the direction 
of the Reeb vector field is fXYa and its component in the direction of the contact 
distribution is uniquely determined by (ILl). 
Conversely, given a function f on B there is a unique section Xi of ~ such 
that 
t(Xi )dall; = -dfll;' 
(II.2) 
The vector field X f : = Xi + fYe" is a contact vector field with a( X f) = f. 
0 
Exercise 11.4. Given a function f on a manifold B with contact form a check that 
the vector field X f := Xi + fYa , where Xi is defined by (II.2), is contact. That 
is, show that Lxfa = ha for some function h (cf. Exercise II.2). 
Suppose now that a Lie group G acts on a manifold B preserving a contact 
I-form a. Then for any vector A in the Lie algebra g of G, the induced vector field 
AB satisfies1 LABa = 0 and, in particular, is contact. Since the contact form a 
defines a 1-1 correspondence between contact vector fields and functions, it makes 
sense to define the a-moment map \If '" : B ---+ g* by 
(II.3) 
for all b E B and all A E g. Note that by Exercise 1.14 the a-moment map \If a is 
G-equivariant. 
The a-moment map, as the name suggests, depends rather strongly on a: if f 
is any positive G-invariant function on B, then fa is another G-invariant contact 
form and clearly 
In particular, unlike in the symplectic case, the image of a moment map is not an 
invariant of the action and of the contact structure. However the moment cone 
C( I}! Q) defined by 
is an invariant of the action of G on (B, ~ = ker a). 
I Recall that the vector field AB is defined by AB(b) = ft It=o exp(tA) . b. 

195 
Remark II.5. Suppose a Lie group G acts on a manifold B preserving a contact 
form c¥. The action of G lifts to an action on the cotangent bundle T* B which 
preserves the annihilator e of the contact structure ~ = ker c¥. Moreover, the action 
preserves the component ~+ of ~"O which contains the image of c¥ : B ---4 T* B. 
The action of G on T* B is Hamiltonian with a natural moment map <I> 
T* B ---4 g* given by 
(<I>(b,p), A) = (p, AB(b)) 
for all bE B, pET; B, A E g. Since the submanifold ~+ is a G-invariant symplectic 
submanifold of T* B the restriction \[1 := <I>!E+ is a moment map for the action of 
G on ~+. It is not hard to check that 
For this and other reasons it makes sense to think of \[1 : ~+ ---4 g* as the moment 
map for the action of G on (B,~).2 Note also that C(\[1,,) = \[1(~+) U {O}. We will 
thus denote the moment cone C(\[1,,) by C(\[1). 
Consequently and by analogy with symplectic toric manifolds we will think 
of contact toric G-manifolds as triples (B,~ = kerc¥, \[1: ~+ ---4 g*). 
2Note that since <I? is G-equivariant and a : B --; T* B is G-equivariant, Ilia is G-equivariant 
as well. This gives us an alternative proof that the a-moment map is equivariant. 

Chapter III 
Proof of Theorem 1.38 
The rest of the lecture notes will be devoted to a proof of Theorem 1.38. Right 
from the beginning the proof will bifurcate into two cases: the contact manifold 
B is 3-dimensional and dim B > 3. If dim B = 3 we will argue directly using slices 
that the orbit space B / G is homeomorphic to a closed interval [0, 1] and then use 
this to compute the integral cohomology of B. This will show that B cannot be 
homeomorphic to 5*']['2 = '][':l. 
We will then consider the case where dim B > 3. In this case we have a 
connectedness and convexity theorem of Banyaga and Molino (see [BM1, BM2J; 
for a different proof see [L2]): 
Theorem 111.1. Let (B,~ = kern, W : ~~ ----) g*) be a compact connected contact 
toric G-manifold. Suppose dim B > 3. Then the fibers of the moment map Ware 
G-orbits (and in particular are connected) and the moment cone C(W) is a convex 
polyhedral cone in g*. Moreover C(W) =f g* iff the action of G is not free. 
Our proof will then bifurcate again. We will consider separately the case 
where the moment cone contains a linear subspace of dimension k, 0 < k < dim G 
and where no such subspace exists (i.e., the moment cone is proper). 
In the first case we will use a uniqueness theorem of Boucetta and Molino 
[BoM]1 for symplectic toric manifolds to argue that the symplectization B x IR of 
B is diffeomorphic to the manifold N = ']['k X (IRk X rei " {(O, O)}) where 2l + 2k = 
dim B + 1 and k, l > O. It is easy to see that N cannot be homotopy equivalent 
T*']['n " 0, n = k + l. 
In the latter case we will argue following Boyer and Galicki [BG] that there 
is a locally free2 51 action on B such that the quotient B / 51 is a (compact 
connected) symplectic toric orbifold. Since the action of 51 is locally free there is 
lThe result was rediscovered a few years later by Lerman, Tolman and Woodward (Lemma 7.2 
and Proposition 7.3 in [LT]). 
2 An action of a Lie group G on a manifold Z is locally free if all the isotropy groups are zero 
dimensional. 

198 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
a long exact sequence of rational cohomology groups (the Gysin sequence) tying 
together the cohomology of B and of B / Sl.0n the other hand Morse theory on 
the orbifold B / Sl shows that all odd-dimensional rational cohomology of B / Sl 
vanishes. Together these two facts will imply that dimlQi H1 (B, Q) :::; 1 . Thus B 
cannot be s*']['n = ,][,n x sn-1, n = ~ (dim B + 1) > 2. This completes the preview 
of our proof of Theorem 1.38. 
111.1 
Homogeneous vector bundles and slices 
Suppose that G is a Lie group, H eGa closed subgroup and suppose we have a 
representation of H on a vector space W. Then H acts on the product G x W by 
h· (g,w) = (gh- 1,g. w) for h E H, (g,w) E G x W. The quotient G XH W:= 
(G x W) / H is a vector bundle over G / H with typical fiber W. We denote the 
image of (g, w) E G x Win G XH W by [g, w]. Note that the action of G on G x W 
given by a· (g, w) = (ag, w) commutes with the action of H and hence descends 
to an action G on G XH W: a· [g,w] = [ag,w]. The projection G XH W --+ G/H 
is G-equivariant and the action of G on the base G / H is transitive. This makes 
G x H W --+ G / H into a homogeneous vector bundle. 
Conversely if 7r : E --+ G / H is a vector bundle with an action of G by vector 
bundle maps making 7r equivariant, then E is isomorphic to G XH W where W is 
the fiber of E above the identity coset 1H.3 Indeed the map 
G x W --+ E, 
(g, w) f-t 9 . w 
is onto and is constant along the orbits of H. It descends to a vector bundle 
isomorphism 
G XH W --+ E, 
[g, w] f-t g. w. 
Next suppose a compact Lie group G acts on a manifold M. Consider an 
orbit G· xC M. The group G acts on the normal bundle of the orbit v(G· x) = 
TMlcx/T(G· x) making the projection 7r : v(G· x) --+ (G· x) equivariant. Thus 
v(G· x) = G XH W where W = TxM/Tx(G· x). 
If we choose a G-invariant Riemannian metric on M 4 we can identify v( G . 
x) with the perpendicular of T(G . x) in TMlcx. Furthermore, the Riemannian 
exponential map exp : v(G . x) --+ M is G-equivariant. Hence, by the Tubular 
Neighborhood theorem we get: 
Lemma 111.2. Let G be a compact connected Lie group acting on a manifold M and 
let x E M be a point. A neighborhood of G·x in Mis G-equivariantly diffeomorphic 
to a neighborhood of the zero section of the homogeneous vector bundle G xC x W 
where Gx denotes the isotropy group of x and W = T.y,M/Tx(G· x). 
:3Why is there a representation of H on W? 
'lChoose any metric on M and then average it over the group G (d. proof of Lemma 1.36). 

IIL1. Homogeneous vector bundles and slices

Definition 111.3. Let G be a Lie group acting on a manifold M; let x E M be a 
point. Denote the isotropy group of x by Gx . An embedded submanifold 5 c M 
is a slice through x for the action of G on M if x E 5, 5 is Gx-invariant and 
if the map G x 5 --+ M given by (g, s) 1-+ g. s descends to an open embedding 
G xc x 5 --+ M, [g,s] 1-+ g. s. 
Thus by Lemma II1.2 slices exist for actions of compact Lie groups: we may 
choose as a slice at x the image of a small Gx-invariant neighborhood of ° in 
W = TxM/Tx(G· x) under the exponential map. 
Here is a typical application of the existence of slices. Locally near x the 
quotient M/G is homeomorphic to the quotient (G xC x W)/G = W/Gx. Hence 
quotients of manifolds by actions of compact Lie groups are modeled on quotients 
of vector spaces by linear actions of compact Lie groups. The linear action of Gx 
on W = TxM/Tx(G· x) is called the slice representation at x. 
Here is another application of the above construction: 
Lemma 111.4. Suppose G is a compact abelian group acting effectively on a con-
nected manifold M. Then every slice representation is faithful, i. e., no slice rep-
resentation has a kernel. 
Proof. Suppose the slice representation of H = Gx on W = TxM/T",(G . x) is 
not faithful at a point x E M. By Lemma II1.2 it is no loss of generality to 
assume that a neighborhood of G . x in M is the homogeneous vector bundle 
G XH W 
--+ G/H = G· x and that the point x is [1,0] E G Xu W. If there 
is an element a E H such that a =J. 1 and yet a . w = w for all w E W, then 
a· [g,w] = [ag,w] = [ga,w] = [g,a· w] = [g,w] for all [g,w] E G Xu W (ag = ga 
since G is abelian). Thus a E H fixes an open neighborhood of x. Since the set 
fixed by a is closed and since M is connected it follows that a fixes all of M. This 
contradicts the assumption that the action of G on M is effective. 
0 
Remark III.5. The compactness of the Lie group G is not necessary for the ex-
istence of slices. According to Palais [P] it is only necessary that its action on a 
manifold M be proper (see Definition 1.9 above). 
Thus if an action of a Lie group G on a manifold M is free and proper, then 
the existence of slices tell us that a neighborhood of every orbit is equivariantly 
diffeomorphic to a product of G with some manifold 5. It is not hard to deduce 
from this that the orbit space M/G is a manifold and that the orbit map M --+ 
M/G makes M into a principal G-bundle. 
We now recall a few properties of tori, which for us are compact abelian Lie 
groups. If G is a torus, then the (Lie group) exponential map exp : 9 --+ G is a 
covering map. The kernel Zc of exp is called the integral lattice. Clearly G = 
g/Zc. The group Zc is isomorphic to the fundamental group of G. Also it has the 
property that for any X E Zc the corresponding I-parameter subgroup {exp tX I 
t E JR.} is a circle. The dual lattice Z'G = Homz(Zc,Z) ~ {f E g* If(Zc) c Z} is 
the weight lattice. It parameterizes I-dimension complex representations of G, or, 

200 
III. Proof of Theorem 1.38 
equivalently, group homomorphisms (characters) X : G --+ Sl: Given v E Ze the 
corresponding character Xv : G = g/Ze --+ Sl is defined by Xv (exp X) = e27riv(X) 
for all X E g. Given a character X : G --+ Sl, its differential dX1 at 1 is a weight. 
Recall that a complex representation of a compact abelian group is a direct 
sum of one-dimensional complex representations. Thus a complex representation 
of a torus is completely characterized by a finite set of weights. The same is 
true for symplectic representations of tori -
one defines weights with respect to 
some complex structure compatible with the symplectic form. The weights do not 
depend on the choice of the complex structure; they only depend on the symplectic 
form. 
The Lemma below is a key representation-theoretic fact in the classification 
of symplectic and contact toric manifolds. 
Lemma 111.6. Suppose p : H --+ Sp(V, w) is a symplectic representation of a com-
pact abelian Lie group H on a symplectic vector space (V, w). Suppose that p is 
faithful, i. e., ker p = {I}. 
Then dimH S; ~ dim V. If H = ~ dim V, then H is connected. Moreover, the 
set of weights for the representation of H on (V, w) is a basis of the weight lattice 
Z'H of H. 
Proof. Since H is compact there exists an H-invariant complex structure J on V 
compatible with w (i.e., w(J·, J.) = we·) and for any v =I- 0 we have w(Jv, v) > 0). 
The choice of J identifies (V, w) with en with the standard symplectic struc-
ture R 
~ dZj 1\ dzj , n = 
~ dimlR V. This, in turn, gives us a representation of 
H on en by unitary matrices. Thus we may assume that p is an injective group 
homomorphism p : H --+ U (n). 
The connected component HO of H is a torus. Therefore p(HO) is contained 
in a maximal torus of U(n) which is the n-torus. Since p has no kernel we have 
dimH = dimHo = dimp(HO) S; n = ~ dim V. 
Now suppose dimH = n. Since all maximal tori in U(n) are conjugate, we 
may assume that p(HO) is the standard maximal torus, that is p(HO) is the set 
of all diagonal unitary matrices. Since the only unitary matrices which commute 
with all the diagonal matrices are the diagonal matrices, we see that we must have 
p( H) = p( HO). Consequently since p is faithful, H = HO, i.e., H is a torus. 
Finally the set of weights of the maximal torus Tn in U(n) for its represen-
tation on en is a lattice basis of weight lattice Zi". Hence the set of weights for 
the representation of H on (V,w) is a basis of the weight lattice Z'H of H.

Lemma 111.7. Let (B,~ = kera) be a contact toric G-manifold. Then 
1. No G-orbit is tangent to the contact structure ~. In particular there are no 
fixed points. Hence the a-moment map \It ex does not vanish at any point for 
any G-invariant contact form a. Equivalently \It(('!-) does not contain the 
origin in g* . 
2. All isotropy groups are connected. 

II!.l. Homogeneous vector bundles and slices 
201 
Proof. Let b be a point in B and let H denote its isotropy group. The group H acts 
on the tangent space nB. Since the contact form a is G-invariant, its kernel at b, 
the hyperplane ~b, is an H-invariant subspace of TbB. Since the Reeb vector field 
Yo, of a is unique, the vector Ya(b) is fixed by H. Thus we have an H-equivariant 
splitting 
nB = lRYa(b) EEl ~b. 
Let V = Tb(G· b) n ~b. It is an H-invariant subspace of ~b. Note that since 
dim6 = dimB-l we either have V = n(G·b) or dim V = dim(G·b) -1. We will 
argue that the former case cannot occur. But first we argue that V is an isotropic 
subspace of the symplectic vector space (~b, w = dabb). 
Let x, z E V be two vectors. There exist vectors X, Z E 9 such that X B (b) = x 
and ZB(b) = z. Then w(x, z) = dab(XB(b), ZB(b)). Since G is abelian [ZB' X B] = 
O. The function a(XB) is G-invariant, hence ZB(a(XB)) = O. Therefore 
w(x, y) = da(XB' ZB) = XB(a(ZB)) - ZB(a(XB)) - da([XB' ZB]) = 0 - 0 + O. 
This proves that V is isotropic. 
Since H is compact, there is an H-invariant complex structure J on ~b com-
patible with w. Since V is isotropic, V n JV = 0 and V + JV = V EEl JV is a 
symplectic subspace of (~b,W). It is H-invariant. In fact, since G is abelian, the 
action of H on Tb (G . b) is trivial. Hence the action of H on V EEl JV is trivial as 
well. Let W denote the symplectic perpendicular to V EEl JV. We get a symplectic 
representation of H on W. 
We now argue that if Tb (G . b) C ~b then dim W is less than 2 dim Hand 
that the representation of H on W must be faithful. This by Lemma 111.6 would 
give us a contradiction. We would then conclude that dim W = 2 dim H, which by 
Lemma 111.6 implies that H is connected. 
Suppose now that llJ(G· b) c ~b' Then dim V = dim(G· b). Since B is toric, 
dim B = 2 dim G - 1. Since 
nB = lRY"Jb) EEl V EEl JV EEl W 
(111.1 ) 
dim W = (2dimG-l)-1-2dim(G·b) = 2dimG-2(dimG-dimH) = 2dimH-2. 
Since (111.1) is a splitting as H-representations, the slice representation of H at b 
is lRY",(b) EEl JV EEl W. As we observed earlier the action of H on lRY",(b) EEl JV is 
trivial. Since the action of G on B is effective, the representation of H on W must 
be faithful. Contradiction. 
Therefore Tb (G . b) rt. ~b and so dim V = dim( G . b) - 1. In this case the 
dimension count gives us exactly that dim W = 2 dim H. 
0 
Lemma 111.8. Let H C ']['2 be a closed subgroup isomorphic to Sl. Then there is 
another closed subgroup K c ']['2 isomorphic to Sl such that ']['2 = K x H. 
Proof. Since H is isomorphic to S 1 it is of the form {exp tv I t E lR} for some 
vector v = (n1,md E 7i} = ker{exp : lR2 ---+ ']['2}. We may assume that nl and 

202 
III. Proof of Theorem 1.38 
m 1 are relatively prime. Therefore there exist integers n2, m2 such that n1 m2 -
m1n2 = 1. Hence the vectors (n1,m1) and (n2,m2) form a basis of 7i}. Take 
K = {expt(n2,m2) 1 t E IR}. 
0 
Remark IIL9. More generally if G is a torus and H eGis a closed connected 
subgroup there is another closed connected subgroup KeG so that G = K x H. 
This is a bit harder to prove than the Lemma above. 
111.2 
The 3-dimensional case 
In this section we prove Theorem 1.38 in the case that dim B = 3: 
Lemma III.IO. Let B be a compact connected contact toric G = ']['2 manifold (in 
particular dimB = 3). Suppose the action ofG is not free. Then there exist two 
closed subgroups K 1 , K2 C G isomorphic to 51 so that B is homeomorphic to 
([0,1] x G)/ rv where (0, g) rv (0, ag) for all 9 E G, a E K1 and (1, g) rv (1, ag) 
for all 9 E G and a E K 2 . In other words B is obtained from the manifold with 
boundary [0,1] x G by collapsing circles in the two components of the boundary by 
the respective actions of two circle subgroups. (It may happen that K1 = K"2). 
Exercise III.n. Consider the standard sphere 5:' = {(Z1' Z2) E C2 Ilzll"2 + IZ212 = 
1}. The torus G = {(>'1,A2) E C 2 11A112 = 1, 
IA212 = 1} acts on 5:1 by (AI,A2)· 
(Z1' Z2) = (A1Z1, A2Z2). Show that 5:' is of the form ([0,1] x G)/ rv for two circle 
subgroups K 1 , K2 of G where rv is the equivalence relation in Lemma IILIO. What 
are the subgroups K 1 , K2? 
Proof of Lemma III. 1 O. By Lemma III.7 all isotropy groups for the action of G 
on B are connected and no isotropy group is all of G. Therefore, since dim G = 2 
the possible isotropy groups are trivial or circles. And points with circle isotropy 
groups must exist since the action is not free. 
If the isotropy group of a point b E B is trivial then (by Lemma IIL2 and the 
dimension count) a G-invariant neighborhood U of Gis equivariantly diffeomorphic 
to G x I where I is an open interval and G acts on G x I by g. (a, t) = (ga, t). Hence 
U / G = I and there is a map s : U / G -> B so that 7r 0 s = id where 7r : B -> B / G 
is the orbit map, i.e., 7r has a local section. 
Now consider a point bE B with the isotropy group Gb isomorphic to 5 1 .5 
By Lemma III.2 a neighborhood of b in B is G-equivariantly diffeomorphic to a 
neighborhood of the zero section in G x Go W. By Lemma IIL8 there is a circle 
LeG such that G = G b X L. Note that G· b c:::: L and that dim W = 2 and 
that by Lemma III.4 the representation of Gb on W is faithful. There is only one 
faithful real 2-dimensional representation of 51 -
it is the representation of 51 
on IR2 as 50(2) or, equivalently, the representation of S1 on C as U(I). Since 
G = L X Gb , G xG" W = L x W, where L x Gb acts on L x W by (A,f-L)· (g,w) = 
"By Lemma 1II.7 there are no more possibilities for Gb . 

III. 2. 
The 3-dimensional case

(Ag, fJ,' w). We conclude that there is a G-invariant neighborhood U of G· bin M, 
an isomorphism cp : G -+ Sl X Sl and a diffeomorphism ?j; : U -+ Sl X D2 such 
that ?j;(g. x) = cp(g). ?j;(x) for all 9 E G, x E U. Here (A,fJ,) E S1 x Sl C C X C 
acts on Sl x D2 C C X C by 
Note that Sl x D2 = 
(']['2 x [0,1))/ rv where (A],A2,0) rv (A],fJ,A2,0) for all 
(A1,A2) E ']['2 and fJ, E S1. We conclude that 
1. U/G~[O,I); 
2. U ~ (G x [0,1))/ rv where (g,O) rv (ag,O) for all 9 E G, a E Gb ; 
3. there is a local section s : U /G -+ B of the orbit map 7r : B -+ B/G; 
4. the set of points in U with non-trivial isotropy groups is G· b = 7r- 1(0), 
where again 7r : U -+ [0,1) denotes the orbit map. 
It follows that the orbit space B / G is locally homeomorphic to either an 
open interval or to a half-open interval [0,1). Hence B/G is a topological 1-
dimensional manifold with boundary. Since B / G is compact and connected we 
may identify it with [0,1]. Note that the set of points with non-trivial isotropy 
groups is 7r- 1 ({O, I}), where by abuse of notation 7r : B -+ [0,1] denotes the orbit 
map. More specifically 7r- 1 (0) = G / K 1 , 7r- 1 (1) = G / K2 for some circle subgroups 
K1,K2 c G. 
We now argue that 7r : B -+ [0,1] has a global section 5 : [0,1] -+ B, so that 
7r 0 5( t) = t for all t E [0, 1]. We have seen that sections of 7r exist locally: for every 
t E [0,1] there is an interval I C [0,1] open in [0,1] and containing t and a map 
5 : I -+ B so that 7r 0 5 = idI . We want to patch these local sections into a global 
section. 
Since [0,1] is compact, we can cover it by finitely many intervals I J so that 
on each IJ there is a section 5j : Ij -+ B. Let us now assume for simplicity that 
there are only two intervals: 10 = [0,2/3) and h = (1/3,1]. The case of more than 
two intervals will be left as an exercise to the reader. Thus we have two sections 
50 : [0,2/3) -+ Band 51 : (1/3,1] -+ B. Since G acts freely on 7r- 1((0, 1)) the map 
cp: (1/3,2/3) x G -+ 7r- 1((1/3, 2/3)) given by cp(t,g) = g. 50(t) is a G-equivariant 
diffeomorphism (where G acts on the product (1/3,2/3) x G by multiplication on 
the second factor). We have cp-1 0 50( t) = (t, 1) and cp-1 051 (t) = (t, g( t)) for some 
curve 9 : (1/3,2/3) -+ G. Since (1/3,2/3) is simply connected we may lift 9 to 
a curve l'(t) in the universal cover exp : 9 -+ G of G. Choose a smooth function 
p : (1/3,2/3) -+ [0,1] with p(t) == ° for t near 1/3 and p(t) == 1 for t near 2/3. 
Now consider the curve a: (1/3,2/3) -+ G given by a(t) = exp(p(th(t)). The map 
52(t) = cp(t, a(t)) is a local section of 7r : B -+ [0,1] which agrees with 50 near 1/3 

204 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
and with Sl near 2/3. Thus we can define a global section s : [0,1] --+ B by 
{ 
so(t) 
s(t) = 
S2(t) 
s:~ (t) 
t E [0,1/3]' 
t E [1/3,2/3]' 
t E [1/3,0]. 
Now that we have a global section of 1f : B --+ [0,1] we can define a continuous map 
j : [0,1] x G --+ B, j(t, g) = g. s(t). The map is onto; it descends to a bijective 
continuous map f : ([0, 1] x G) / rv --+ B where rv is the equivalence relation in 
the statement of the Lemma. Since ([0,1] x G)/ rv is compact, the map f is a 
homeomorphism. 
0 
Exercise III. 12 . Show that if the groups K 1 and K 2 in the statement of the Lemma 
are the same, then B is Sl X S2. 
Exercise III.13. (This exercise is considerably harder than the one above.) Show 
that if the groups K1 and K2 are different, then B is the quotient of S:l by a finite 
cyclic group. 
Lemma 111.14. Let G = ']['2 and let K 1, K2 C G be two closed subgroups isomorphic 
to S 1 . Let B be the topological space ([0, 1] x G) / rv where (0, g) rv (0, ag) for all 
g E G, a E KJ and (1, g) rv (l,ag) for all 9 E G and a E K 2. In other words B 
is obtained from the manifold with boundary [0,1] x G by collapsing circles in the 
two components of the boundary by the respective actions of two circle subgroups. 
Then either H1(B, Z) = Z = H2(B, Z) or H1(B, Z) = ° and H2(B, Z) is a 
finite group. In particular, B cannot be homeomorphic to the 3-torus '][':1. 
Proof. Recall that H1 (G, Z) is isomorphic to the weight lattice Zc,' and that the 
isomorphism is given as follows: A weight v E Zo defines a character Xu : G --+ Sl 
by Xu(exp(X)) = e27Tiv(X); the class X~[dB] is the element in H1 (G, Z) correspond-
ing to v. Here dB is the obvious I-form on Sl. 
Consequently if G = ']['2 and K j eGis a circle subgroup, then 1fJ : G --+ 
G / K j 
':::: S1 is a character and hence the weight Vj = (d1fj h defines an element of 
Hl(G,Z). Thus if we identify H1(G/Kj,Z) with Z and HI(G,Z) with Z'(;, then 
the map Hl(G/Kj,Z) --+ Hl(G,Z) becomes the map Z 3 n f--> nVj E Zc;' 
The sets U = ([0,2/3) x G)/ rv and V = ((1/3,1] x G)/ rv are two open 
subsets of B. We have B = UUV, unv = (1/3,2/3) x G is homotopy equivalent 
to G, U is homotopy equivalent to G / K 1, V is homotopy equivalent to G / K2 
and the inclusion maps Un V '--+ U, Un V '--+ V are homotopy equivalent to 
projections 1f1 : G --+ G/K1, 1f2 : G --+ G/K2 respectively. Hence under the above 
identifications of H 1 (U) and HI (V) with Z, the inclusions un V --+ U, Un V --+ V 
induce the maps Z 3 n f--> nVj E ZOl j = 1,2, respectively. 
vVe now apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the integral coho-
mology of B. We have: ° 
--+ HO(B) --+ HO(U) EB H°(V) --+ HO(G) ~ H1(B) --+ 
Hl(U)EBH1(V) --+ HI (G) ~ H2(B) --+ H2(U)EBH2(V) --+ H2(G) ~ H3(B) --+ 0. 

III. 3. 
Uniqueness of symplectic toric manifolds 
205 
Clearly the map HO(U)ffiHO(V) -7 HO(G) is onto. Given the identifications above 
the map cp: Hl(U)ffiHl(V) -7 Hl(G) becomes ZffiZ:3 (n,m) f--+ nVl +mv2 E Zc. 
We therefore have 0 -7 Hl(B) -7 ZffiZ 'f.. Zc!.. H2(B) -7 OffiO -7 H2(G)!.. 
H:3(B) -7 O. We conclude that 
• H2(B) = ZC/(ZVl + ZV2) 
• Hl(B) = {(n, m) E Z2 I nVl + mV2 = O}. 
Since Vl, V2 are differentials of projections onto quotients by circle subgroups, 
either Vl and V2 are independent over Z or Vl = ±V2. In the first case Hl(B) = 0 
and H2(B) is a finite abelian group. In the second case Hl(B) = Z and H2(B) = 
Zc/ZVl = Z. 
D 
This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.38 in the case that dim B = 3. 
111.3 
Uniqueness of symplectic toric manifolds 
In this section we sketch a proof of 
Theorem III.IS. Let (B,~ = kera, W : ~~ -7 g*) be a compact connected contact 
toric G -manifold. 
Suppose the dimension k of the maximal linear subspace of the moment cone 
C(w) = w(~~) U {O} satisfies 0 < k < dim G. Then B is homotopy equivalent to 
the product of a k-torus with a sphere. In particular B is not the co-sphere bundle 
of the n-torus, n = ~(dimB + 1) = dimG. 
The main idea of the proof is simple. We will first argue that there is an 
action of G on the symplectic manifold 
l = ~(dimB + 1 - k) > 0, with moment map 1> : M -7 g* such that 
1>(M) = w(~~). 
(III.2) 
We then argue that (II1.2) implies that M is G-equivariantly symplectomorphic 
to ~~. Note that M is homotopy equivalent to ']['k x S"+21-1. 
We start with the definition of a symplectic slice representation (c.f. proof of 
Lemma III. 7), which is essential for understanding the local structure of symplectic 
toric manifolds. 
Definition III.I6. Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action 
of a torus G. Then an orbit G· m is an isotropic submanifold of (M,w).6 The 
symplectic slice representation at m is the representation of the isotropy group 
6For a proof of this easy fact see, for example, [GS]. 

206 
III. Proof of Theorem 1.38 
G m of m on the symplectic vector space V := Tm(G . m)W /Tm(G . m). Here, 
as usual, T m (G . m)W denotes the symplectic perpendicular to T m (G . m) in the 
symplectic vector space (TmM,wm). 
The equivariant isotropic embedding theorem (see for example [GS], The-
orem 39.1) asserts that a neighborhood of an orbit G· m is determined (up to 
equivariant symplectomorphisms) by the symplectic slice representation at m. In 
fact, the topological normal bundle of the orbit G . m in M is G x Ii (g/~ x V) 
where H is the isotropy group of m and ~ is its Lie algebra (op. cit.). 
Remark III. 17 . In the case of symplectic toric manifolds the dimension of the 
symplectic slice V at m is twice the dimension of the isotropy group Gm . Hence 
by Lemma III.6 the group Gm is connected and the representation of Gm on V 
is determined by a set of weights {Vi} which forms a basis of the weight lattice of 
Gm . Note that the image of V under the moment map <l>v : V ~ g;" defined by 
the representation is the cone 
In particular the edges of the cone are spanned by the weights. Alternatively, the 
isotropy group Gm is isomorphic to ']['1 for some I and the slice representation 
p : Gm ~ Sp(V) is isomorphic to the standard representation of ']['1 on C I.7 
With a little more work one can prove the following two propositions (their 
proofs can be found, for example, in [D]). 
Proposition 111.18. Let (M, w, <I> : M ~ g*) be a symplectic toric manifold, m E 
M a point and U a neighborhood of G . m in M. Then for a sufficiently small 
ball 0 about 'f] = <I>(m) in g* the set <I>(U) nO determines the symplectic slice 
representation at m and hence a small G-invariant neighborhood of G . m in M. 
Proposition 111.19. Let (M, w, <I> : M ~ g*) be a symplectic to ric manifold, m E M 
a point, 'f] = <I>(m) and Gm the isotropy group ofm. Identify Gm with the standard 
torus ']['d, d = dim G m , and extend it to an identification of G with ']['d x ']['C, 8 
C = dimG - dimGm . 
A G-invariant neighborhood U of G . m in M is equivariantly symplectomor-
phic to a neighborhood of ']['C x {(O, on in T*,][,c x Cd ~ ']['C x (JRC)* X Cd. Hence 
where 1> : T*,][,c x Cd ~ (JRC)* X (JRd)* ~ g* is the moment map for the "obvious" 
action of G = ']['C X ']['d on T*,][,C x C d .9 
7The standard representation of 1l'1 = {(AI, ... , AI) E C1 I IAJ I = 1} on C1 is given by 
(AI, ... ,AI) . (Zl, ... ,ZI) = (AIZI, ... , AIZI). 
HHere we use Remark III.9. 
9The "obvious" action of 1l'C on T*1l'c is the lift of left multiplication. 

III. 3. 
Uniqueness of symplectic toric manifolds 
207 
Corollary 111.20. Let (B, ~ = ker a, \If : ~+) be a compact connected contact toric G-
manifold. Suppose the dimension k of the maximal linear subspace of the moment 
cone C(\If) = \If(~+) U {o} satisfies ° < k < dimG. 
Then there is an identification of G with 1['k x 1['1! l = dim G - k! so that 
where q> : T*1['k x rei --+ (JRk )* x (JRI)* '::' g* is the moment map for the obvious 
action of 1['k x 1['1 on T*1['k x rei. 
Proof. If C is a cone in g* whose maximal linear subspace is P and if U is a 
neighborhood in g* of a point 77 E P then C equals the cone on Un C with the 
vertex at 77: 
C = {t(JL - 77) + 77 1 t ;::: 0, JL E Un C}. 
Since the B is contact toric \If (~+) does not contain the origin (c.f. Lemma III. 7). 
Since B is compact and \If : ~+ --+ g* is homogeneous, \If : ~+ --+ g* " {o} is proper. 
Hence for any 77 E \If(~+) and any neighborhood U of \If-I (77), \If(U) is a neighbor-
hood of 77 in \If(~+). 
Moreover, since the fibers of \If are G-orbits (by Theorem IlI.I), for any 
neighborhood U of an orbit G· m the set \If(U) is a neighborhood of 77 = \If(m) 
in \If(~+). In particular it contains a set of the form () n \If(~+) where () c g* is a 
small ball about 77. 
Let P c C(\If) be the maximal linear subspace and let ° 
i=- 77 E P. Then, as 
noted at the beginning of the proof, for any ball () c g* about 77 we have 
C(\If) = {t(JL - 77) + 77 1 t ;::: 0, JL E () n \If(~+)} 
= {t(JL -77) + 771 t;::: 0, JL E \If(U)}. 
On the other hand, it follows from Proposition IlLIg that 
for some integers c and d. It follows that c = k, d = dim G - k = l and that 
Note that since q>-1(0) = 1['k x {(O, O)}, we get 
\If(~+) = q>(M), 
where M = (T*1['k x rei)" (1['k x {(O,O)}).

Definition 111.21. A symplectic toric G-manifold (M, w, <I> : M --+ g*) is good (for 
the purposes of these lectures) if 

208 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
1. the fibers of <I> : M ---t g* are connected, 
2. the set <I>(M) is contractible and 
3. there is an open set U C g* such that <I>(M) c U and the map <I> : M ---t U 
is proper. 
The definition is designed in such a way that it includes compact symplectic 
toric manifolds, symplectizations of compact contact toric manifolds of dimension 
bigger than 3 and the manifolds of the form M = (T*'Irk xCi)" ('Irk x {(O,O)}), 
o < k, I. As a consequence of the definition and of Proposition III.18 we have 
Lemma 111.22. Let (M, w, <I> : M 
---t g*) be a good symplectic toric manifold. 
For any point 7] E <I>(M) and any sufficiently small ball 0 centered at 7], the set 
On<I>(M) determines the symplectic toric manifold (<I>-l(O),wl1>-'(o),<I>I1>-'(o») 
(up to a G-equivariant symplectomorphism). 
Definition 111.23. Two symplectic toric G-manifolds (M, w, <I> : M 
---t g*) and 
(M',w',<I>': M' ---t g*) are isomorphic if there is a G-equivariant diffeomorphism 
a: M ---t M' such that a*w' = wand a*<I>' = <I>. 
We denote by Iso( M, w, <I» 
= Iso( M) the group of isomorphisms of a sym-
plectic toric manifold (M, w, <I> ). 
Note that the last condition on a is almost redundant -
if a is symplectic 
and G-equivariant then a*<I>' = <I> + c for some constant vector c E g*. We impose 
the last condition for technical convenience. 
Definition 111.24. Two symplectic toric G-manifolds (M, w, <I> : M 
---t g*) and 
(M', w', <I>' : M' ---t g*) are locally isomorphic over a set 6. c g* if 
1. <I>(M) = 6. = <I>'(M') and 
2. for any 7] E 6. and any sufficiently small ball 0 c g* centered at 7] the 
symplectic toric manifolds (<I>-1(0), WI1>-'(O), <I>11>-'(0») and 
(( <I>') -1 (0), w'l (1)') -1 (0) , <I>'I (1)') -1 (0») are isomorphic. 
Given the above definitions we see that Lemma III.22 implies 
Lemma 111.25. Suppose (M, w, <I» 
and (M', w', <I>') are two good symplectic toric 
G-manifolds with <I>(M) = <I>'(M'). Then (M,w,<I» 
and (M',w',<I>') are locally 
isomorphic over 6. = <I>(M). 
Therefore the proof of Theorem III.15 reduces to 
Proposition 111.26. Any good symplectic toric G-manifold locally isomorphic to a 
given symplectic toric G -manifold (M, w, <I» is actually isomorphic to (M, w, <I». 

III. 3. 
Uniqueness of symplectic toric manifolds 
209 
The proposition could be stated for a larger class of symplectic toric man-
ifolds. We leave it to the reader to find the most general form of the statement 
(and prove it). The rest of the section is occupied with a proof of the proposition. 
Suppose a symplectic toric G-manifold (M', w', <1>') is locally isomorphic to 
(M,w, <1». Then for any 1] E <1>(M) and for any sufficiently small ball 0 C g* 
about 1] the symplectic toric manifold <1>-1 (0) is isomorphic to (<1>') -1 (0). Choose 
a locally finite cover {OdiE! of <1>(M) by such balls. Then for each index i we have 
an isomorphism 
Let Oij = Oi n OJ. Define 
gij : <1>-1 (Oij) ~ <1>-1 (O;j), 
9ij = i;-1 0 ij 
(to keep the notation manageable we wrote ii for the restriction ii io'J etc.; we 
will continue to omit restrictions in the rest of the section). It is easy to see that 
gii = id, gij 0 gji = id, and gij 0 gjk 0 gki = id 
(III.3) 
wherever these equations make sense. 
The data {O,}, {g;d and (M,w,<1» 
allow us to reconstruct (M',w', <1>'). 
Indeed, let !VI = U<1>-I(Oi). Define a relation rv on !VI by <1>-1(0,) :3 x, 
rv 
Xj E <1>-1(OJ) iff Xj = gij(Xi). Equations (IIL3) imply that rv is an equiva-
lence relation. It follows that !VI / rv is a symplectic toric manifold. Moreover 
the map F : !VI ~ M' defined by FI<I>-l(O<) = i, descends to a well defined map 
F : !VI / rv~ M'. The map P is an isomorphism. 
Suppose fi : <1>-1 (Oi) ~ (<1>')-I(Oi) is another collection of isomorphisms. 
Let fi,] = (f,)-1 0 fJ. Clearly

g,.j= ;og,.10 ) 
(III.4) 
where hi = ii- 1 0 f, E Iso(<1>-1 (0,)). 
We also get a different set of data if we choose a different cover. However, all 
these sets of data define one object 
a class in the first Cech cohomology with 
coefficients in a certain sheaf. Let us now review the notions of sheaves and Cech 
cohomology. There are many good references for this material. I will be following 
[WW]. 
Definition 111.27. A sheaf of groups S on a topological space X is an assignment 
S: {opens sets in X} ~ groups, U f---+ S(U) 
satisfying two conditions: 
1. For a pair of open sets U C W in X there is a restriction map pty : S(W) ~ 
S(U) such that for any three sets U eWe V of X 
w 
v 
v 
pu opw = pu· 

210 
III. Proof of Theorem 1.38 
Elements of 5(U) are called sections. Given a section cP E 5(W) we write 
cpl U for prj( cp). 
2. Given an open cover {Ud of an open set U (so that U = U Ui ) and a 
collection of sections CPi E 5(Ui ) such that 
CPiluinul = CPjlu,nuJ 
for all indices i, j there is a unique section cP E 5(U) such that 
cplu, = CPi 
for all i. 
The sheaf 5 is abelian if 5(U) is an abelian group for all open sets U. 
Three examples of sheaves will be important to us. Check that they are 
indeed sheaves. 
Example III.28. Let (M, w,.p) be a good symplectic toric G-manifold. The assign-
ment Iso: U f-+ Iso(U) (U c .p(M) open) is a sheaf on .p(M). The group operation 
is composition. 
Example III.29 (Locally constant sheaf). Let H be a group and X a topological 
space. The assignment that associates the group H to every open connected subset 
of X is a sheaf, called a locally constant sheaf. It is denoted by H. Thus H (U) = H 
for every connected open set U eX. The group operation is the multiplication in 
H. 
Example III. 30 . Let (M, w, .p) be a good symplectic toric G-manifold. Define a 
sheaf Con .p(M) by 
C(U) = C'XJ(.p-1(U))G, 
G-invariant smooth functions on .p-l(U). 
The group operation is addition of functions. 
Definition III.31. Let 5 1,52 be sheaves on a topological space X. A map of sheaves 
T : 51 -> 52 is a family of group homomorphisms 
compatible with the restrictions: 
W 
IV 
(P2)U 
0 fw = fu 0 (Pl)U 
for all pairs U c W of open sets in X. 
Example III.32. Consider the sheaves Iso and C defined in Examples III.28 and 
III.30 above. A section f E C(U) is a G-invariant function on .p-1(U). Its time 
t flow cpr preserves the fibers of .p and is a G-equivariant symplectomorphism of 
.p-1 (U). Hence cpr is a section ofIso(U). This gives us for each open set U c <I>(M) 
a map TU : C(U) -> Iso(U), TU(f) = cP{. Moreover, any two functions iI, 12 E C(U) 
Poisson commute [prove this]. Hence cp{' 0 cp{2 = cp{' + 12 and therefore TU is a group 
homomorphism. Thus we get a map of sheaves T : C -> Iso. 

III. 3. 
Uniqueness of symplectic toric manifolds 
211 
Given a map of sheaves T : Sl ---+ S2 one can define the sheaves the kernel and 
image sheaves kerT and imT: for an open set U (kerT)(U) = kerTu, (imT)(U) = 
im TU. Hence it makes sense to say that a map of sheaves is onto and more generally 
talk about exact sequences of sheaves. 10 
Proposition 111.33. Let (M, w, <I» 
be a good symplectic toric manifold. The map of 
sheaves T : C ---+ Iso defined above is onto. Hence Iso is an abelian sheaf. 
The kernel of T is the locally constant sheaf IR x Ze. We thus have a short 
exact sequence of abelian sheaves: 
o ---+ IR X Ze ---+ C ---+ Iso ---+ O. 
The proposition is due to Boucetta and Molino [BoM]. See also [LT]. 
111.3.1 
tech cohomology 
In this subsection we "review" the notion of Cech cohomology with coefficients in 
an abelian sheaf. There are many good references, such as [WW], for the nontrivial 
facts that we list below without proofs. 
Let X be a topological space {Ui} an open locally finite cover of X and S 
an abelian sheaf on X. A 0 Cech cochain is a function that assigns to each index 
i an element fi of S(U,), i.e., the group of O-cochains C O( {U,}, S) is the product 
I1 S(U,). A 1 Cech cochain &')signs to an ordered pair of indices ij an element gij 
of S(ViJ) where Vi) = U, n U). Moreover we require that gil = -gji (we now think 
of the groups S(U) additively). More generally a p-cochain assigns to an ordered 
p + 1 tuple of indices i o ... ip an element Si".i" E S(Ui" ... i,') where U'''''''l' = 
u'on .. . nUil, and s,,, ... ,.,, is skew-symmetric in the indices. The coboundary operator 
5: CP({U,},S) ---+ Cp+l({U,},S) is defined by 
where 7J means that the index is omitted, and where we omitted writing the 
restrictions of the terms on the right hand side to Uill ... i " 11' One proves that 
5'2 = O. The cohomology of the complex (CP({Ui},S),5) denoted by H*({V,},S) 
is called the Cech cohomology of the cover {U,} with coefficients in the sheaf S. 
Given a refinement {VJ } of the cover {Ui } the restrictions give rise to a chain 
map CP ( {V,}, S) ---+ CP ( {Vj }, S), which in turn gives rise to a map in cohomology 
H*({U,},S) ---+ H*({Vj},S). Taking the direct limit over all locally finite covers 
we get a well-defined cohomology group 
H*(X,S) = I~H*({U,},S), 
the Cech cohomology of X with coefficients in the sheaf S. 
lOWarning: the map T : S1 ---'0 S2 being onto does not mean that TU is onto for every open set 
U. See [WW] or any other good book on sheaves for more details. 

212 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
Now let (M, w, <I> : M ---+ g*) be a good symplectic toric G-manifold and {ad 
a locally finite cover of <I>(M) by sufficiently small balls. If {gij} E C1({ad,Iso) 
is a l-cochain, then b( {g**}) = 0 means that for all triples of indices ijk we have 
0= b( {g**} )ijk = ~gjk + gik + gij, 
which is (III.3) in additive notation (where on the right hand side we omitted the 
restrictions to Uij k). Similarly if {gij}, {.Yij} E C 1 ( { a i}, Iso) are two l-cochains 
that differ by b ( { h*}) for some O-cochain {hi} then 
gij ~ gij = ~hi + hj 
hence 
gij = hi + gij ~ hj, 
which is (III.4) in additive notation. Thus the discussion above shows that to ev-
ery element of H1 ({ ad, Iso) there corresponds a good symplectic toric manifold 
(M',w',<I>': M ---+ g*) locally isomorphic to (M,w,<I>: M ---+ g*). More gener-
ally one can check that there is a one-to-one correspondence between cohomology 
classes in H1(<I>(M), Iso) and isomorphism classes of good symplectic toric man-
ifolds locally isomorphic to (M, w, <I> : M ---+ g*). Thus to complete the proof of 
Proposition III.26 (and thereby Theorem IIL15) it remains to show that the group 
}J1(<I>(M),Iso) is trivial for any good symplectic toric manifold M. For this we 
use Proposition III.33, two properties of Cech cohomology and a property of the 
sheaf C defined in Example III.30. The first property of Cech cohomology that we 
need is 
Theorem III.34. A short exact sequence of abelian sheaves 0 ---+ 51 ---+ 52 ---+ S:l ---+ 0 
on a space X induces a long exact sequence in tech cohomology

-
+1 
... ---+ HP(X,5d ---+ HP(X,52) ---+ HP(X,53 ) ---+ HP 
(X,5d ---+ ... 
The second property that we will use is 
Theorem III.35. Let X be a simply connected topological space and H an abelian 
group. The tech cohomology H*(X, H) of X with coefficients in the locally con-
stant sheaf H is isomorphic to the singular cohomology H* (X, H) of X with coef-
ficients in the abelian group H. 
We will use the following property of the sheaf C (cf. [LT], Proposition 7.3) 
Lemma III.36. The sheaf C defined in Example III.30 is acyclic, that is, 
Hq(<I>(M),C) = 0 for all q > O. 
Now putting Theorem III.34, Lemma IIL36 and Proposition IIL33 together 
we see that if (M, w, <I» is a good symplectic toric G-manifold and Iso the sheaf de-
fined in Example IIL28 then the cohomology group H1(<I>(M), Iso) is isomorphic 
to if2(<I>(M),IR x Zo). The latter group is isomorphic to the singular cohomol-
ogy group H2(<I>(M),Zo x IR) by Theorem III.35. But <I>(M) is contractible, so 
H2(<I>(M),Zo x IR) = O. Therefore H1(<I>(M),Iso) = 0, which proves Proposi-
tion IIL26 and thereby Theorem IIL15. 

III. 4. 
Proof of Theorem I.38, part three 
213 
111.4 
Proof of Theorem 1.38, part three 
The goal of this section is to prove 
Theorem 111.37. Let (B,~ = kera, \[1 : ~+ -+ 9*) be a compact connected contact 
toric G-manifold with dim B 2 3. Suppose there is a vector X in the Lie algebra 9 
of G such that the function (\[1, X) is strictly positive on B. Then dim HI (B, JR.) :s; 
1. In particular B is not the co-sphere bundle 8* G = Tn X sn-l! n = dim G = 
~ (dim B + 1) 2 2. 
The proof of Theorem III.37 above will complete our proof of Theorem 1.38. 
Since Theorem 1.38 implies the main result of the notes, Theorem 1.4, this, in turn, 
will finish the proof of the main result. As was sketched out at the beginning of 
Chapter 4 our proof of Theorem II1.37 has several steps. The first one is a theorem 
implicit in a paper of Boyer and Galicki [BG]: 
Theorem 111.38. Let (B,~ = kera, \[1 : ~+ -+ 9*) be a compact connected contact 
toric G-manifold with dim B 2 3. Suppose there is a vector X in the Lie algebra 
9 of G such that the function (\[1, X) is strictly positive on B. Then there exists 
on B a locally free circle action so that the quotient M = B / SI is a (compact) 
symplectic toric orbifold. 
The second step is the argument that if M is a compact connected symplectic 
toric orbifold then Hq(M, JR.) = 0 for all odd degrees q. This step uses Morse theory 
on orbifolds. 
Let us now see why these two steps give us a proof of Theorem III.37. Consider 
the circle action produced by Theorem II1.38 and the corresponding S1 orbit map 
7r : B -+ M. If the circle action is actually free, then 7r is a circle fibration and we 
have the Gysin sequence 
0= H- 1(M, JR.) -+ HI(M, JR.) -+ HI(B, JR.) -+ HO(M, JR.) -+ H2(M, JR.) -+ .... 
(III.5) 
If the action of Sl is locally free, the long exact sequence (III.5) still exists. The 
reason is that the Gysin sequence arises from a collapse of the Leray-Serre spectral 
sequence for a sphere bundle. For locally free 8 1 actions the orbit map 7r : B -+ M 
is not a fibration, but the corresponding spectral sequences still collapses if we use 
real coefficientsY Now, since HI (M, JR.) = 0 by the second step, it follows from 
(III.5) that dimHI(B, JR.) :s; dimHO(M, JR.) = 1, which proves Theorem III.37. 
Here is an outline of the rest of the section. We start with a review of the no-
tion of orbifold. We recall how orbifolds arise as quotients of manifolds by locally 
free actions of compact Lie groups. We then review the symplectic reduction theo-
rem, in particular the fact that generically symplectic reduced spaces are orbifolds 
and use it to prove Theorem II1.38. Next we define Morse functions on orbifolds, 
and discuss the two fundamental results of Morse theory on orbifolds. Finally we 
llThe reader not familiar with spectral sequences may wish to take this claim on faith. 

214 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
argue that a compact symplectic toric orbifold M has a Morse function with all 
indices even and use this to conclude that the real cohomology of M vanishes in 
odd degrees. 
We now define orbifolds and related differential geometric notions. For more 
details, see Satake [Sal, Sa2] and, for a more modern point of view, Ruan [R]. 
The notion of orbifold was introduced by Satake in 1956 under the name of V-
manifold. Orbifolds are designed to generalize manifolds in the following sense: 
an n-dimensional manifold is locally modeled on an open subset of ]Rn. An n-
dimensional orbifold is locally modeled on a quotient U If where U is an open 
subset of ]Rn and f is a finite group acting smoothly on U. To give a precise 
definition we need a few preliminary notions -
we need to define charts, atlases 
and compatibility of atlases. 
_ 
Let U be a connected topological space, U a connected n-dimensional man-
ifold and f a finite group acting smoothly on U. An n-dimensional uniformizing 
chart 12 on U is a triple (U, f, cp) where cP : U --+ U is a continuous map inducing 
a homeomorphism between U If and U (thus, in particular, cP is constant on the 
orbits of r). We will only consider charts where the set of points in U fixed by f 
is either all of U or is of co dimension 2 or greater. Note that we do not require 
that f acts effectively. 
Two uniformizing charts (U1,fl ,CPl) and (U2,f2,CP2) of U are isomorphic if 
there is a diffeomorphism 'lj; : Ul --+ U2 and an isomorphism>. : fl --+ f2 such 
that 'lj; is >.-equivariant (i.e., 'lj;(g. x) = >.(g). 'lj;(x) for all g E fl' X E UJ) and 
CP2 o'lj; = CPl. For example, fix a E f. Define 'lj; : U --+ U by 'lj;(x) = a· x. Let 
>.(g) = aga- l . Then ('lj;,>.): (U,f,cp) --+ (U,f,cp) is an isomorphism. 
Let L : U' ~ U be a connected open subset of U. We say that a uniformizing 
chart (U', f', cp') is induced from a uniformizing chart (U, f, cp) on U if there is a 
monomorphism>. : f' --+ f and a >.-equivariant embedding 'lj; : U' --+ U such that 
LOCP' = cpo'lj;. In this case ('lj;,>.): (U',f',cp') --+ (U,f,cp) is called an injection. 
An orbifold atlas on a Hausdorff topological space M is an open cover U of 
M satisfying the following conditions: 
1. Each element U of U is uniformized, say by (U, f, cp). 
2. If U, U' E U and U' c U then there is an injection (U', f', cp') --+ (U, f, cp). 
3. For any point p E Ul n U2 , Ul , U2 E U, there is a connected open set U;) E U 
with p E u'3 C Ul n U2 (and hence there are injections (U3, f3, CP3) --+ 
(Ul , fl' cpJ) and (U3, f3, CP:l) --+ (U2, f2, CP2)). 
Suppose that V and U are two orbifold atlases on a space M, that V is a 
refinement of U and that for every V E V and U E U with V c U we have an 
injection (V,~,¢) ~ (U,f,cp), where (V,~,¢) and (U,f,cp) are the respective 
uniformizing charts. We then say that V and U are directly equivalent orbifold 
atlases. Now take the smallest equivalence relation on the orbifold atlases on M 
12 Ruan calls it a uniJormizing system. 

III.4. 
Proof of Theorem I.38, part three 
215 
so that any two directly equivalent atlases on M are equivalent. We now define an 
orbifold to be a Hausdorff topological space together with an equivalence class of 
orbifold atlases. 
Let x be a point in an orbifold M, and let (U, r, <p) be a uniformizing chart 
with x E <p(U). The (orbifold) structure group of x is the isotropy group of a point 
in the fiber <p-l (x). It is well-defined as an abstract group: if Xl , X2 E <p-1 (x) then 
the corresponding isotropy groups are conjugate in r. 
Remark III.39. It is not hard to show that if (U, r, <p) is a uniformizing chart of 
U, then for any point x E U there is a neighborhood U' and a uniformizing chart 
(U',r',<p') induced from (U,r,<p) such that (<p')-1(X) is a single point x (and 
hence r' fixes x). We will refer to (U',r',<p') as a chart centered at x. 
Let M be an orbifold with an atlas {Ui , r i, <p;}. A smooth function I on M 
is a collection of smooth ri-invariant functions h on Ui such that for any injection 
('l/Jij,Aij) : (Uj,rj,<pj) '---+ (Ui,ri,<Pi) we have 'l/Ji/Ji = k Naturally each Ji 
defines a continuous map Ii : U;jri = Ui --+ lR. Thanks to the compatibility 
conditions above, these maps glue together to define a continuous map from the 
topological space underlining M to lR. By abuse of notation we may write I : 
M --+ lR. Similarly, a differential k-form IJ on the orbifold M is a collection of 
r i-invariant k-forms a i on Ui such that for any injection ('l/Jij, Aij) : (Uj , r j , <p j) '---+ 
(Ui , r i, <Pi) we have 'l/Ji/ ai = aj. We denote the collection of all differential forms 
on M by O*(M). Note that O*(M) has a well-defined exterior multiplication (since 
exterior multiplication behaves well under pull-backs) and exterior differentiation 
d : O*(M) --+ O*+l(M) (for the same reason). In the same manner one defines 
vector fields, Riemannian metrics, quadratic forms and other differential geometric 
objects on orbifolds. 
Finally we define maps of orbifolds. The reader should be aware that there are 
several notions of maps of orbifolds. For example Satake in his two papers gave two 
inequivalent definitions. The one we give below is the simplest; it is not the best. 
It will, however, suffice for our purposes. See Ruan's survey [R] for a more modern 
point of view. Let (M, {Ui , f;, <p;}) and (N, {~, ~j, <Pj}) be two orbifolds and let 
F : M --+ N be a continuous map of underlying topological spaces. The map F is 
a (smooth) map of orbifolds if for every point x E M there are charts (Ui , r i, <p,), 
(~,~j,<Pj) with x E <p(Ui ), F(<Pi(Ui )) C <Pj(~) and a Coo map Fji : Ui --+ ~ 
such that 
<Pj 0 Fji = F 0 <Pi. 
The reason for the appearance of orbifolds in these notes is the symplectic 
reduction theorem of Marsden, Weinstein and Meyer [MW, Me]: 
Theorem 111.40. Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action 
of a Lie group C. Let <I> : M --+ g* denote a corresponding moment map. Suppose 
77 E g* is a regular value of <I> and suppose that the action of the isotropy group 
Cry of77 on <1>-1(77) is proper. Then the action of Cry on <1>-1(77) is locally free and 
the quotient Mry := <1>-1 (77)/Cry is naturally a symplectic orbifold. 

216 
III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
We will not discuss the proof of this well known theorem. Instead let me 
briefly explain why quotients by locally free actions are orbifolds. The reason is the 
slice theorem: if the action of a Lie group G is locally free and proper on a manifold 
Z, then for any point z E Z there is a slice S z for the action of G and the isotropy 
group Gz is finite. The quotient SzlGz is homeomorphic to a neighborhood of the 
orbit G· z in the orbit space ZIG. The triple (Sz, Gz, rp : Sz ----+ SzlGz '-> ZIG) is 
a uniformizing chart of the orbifold ZIG. 
Let us now prove Theorem III.38. 
Proof of Theorem III. 38. Since B is compact, the image Wa(B) is compact. There-
fore the set of vectors X' E £I, such that the function (Woo, X') is strictly pos-
itive on B, is open. Hence we may assume that X lies in the integral lattice 
Ze := ker(exp : £I 
----+ G) of the torus G. Let H = {exptX I t E lR} be the 
corresponding circle subgroup of G. 
Let f(x) = 1/((wa (x),X)) and let a' = fa. The form a' is another G-
invariant contact form with ker a' = ~. The moment map Woo' defined by a' satisfies 
wa' = fWa. Therefore (wa'(x),X) = 1 for all x E B. 
Since the function (Woo, X) is nowhere zero, the action of H on B is lo-
cally free. Consequently the induced action of H on the symplectization (N, w) = 
(B x lR,d(eta')) is locally free as well. Hence any a E lR is a regular value 
of the X-component (<p, X) of the moment map <P for the action of G on the 
symplectization (N,w). Note that <p(x, t) = -etwry'(x). The manifold B x {O} 
is the -1 level set of (<I>, X). Therefore by the symplectic reduction theorem 
M := ((<I>,X))-l(-l)IH c:::: BIH is a (compact connected) symplectic orbifold. 
The action of G on ((<I>, X) ) -1 ( -1) descends to an effective Hamiltonian action of 
G I H on M. A dimension count shows that the effective action of G I H on M is 
completely integrable, i.e., M is a symplectic toric orbifold.

The rest of the section is a proof that real odd dimensional cohomology 
vanishes for compact symplectic toric orbifolds. It uses Morse theory. 
111.4.1 
Morse theory on orbifolds 
Let us start by briefly reviewing the fundamental results of Morse theory on mani-
folds. Let f : M ----+ lR be a smooth function. A critical point of f is a point p where 
the differential df is O. The image f(p) of a critical point p is a critical value of 
f. A critical point p of f is nondegenerate if the Hessian d2 fp is a nondegenerate 
quadratic form (in local coordinates d2 fp is the matrix of second order partials 
~ 
; thus d2 fp(x) = I: .. ~XiXj). The index of a nondegenerate critical 
( 
82f )

point p is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian d2 fp (counted with 
multiplicities.) The two and a half fundamental results of Morse theory are the 
two theorems and the lemma below. 

III.4. 
Proof of Theorem 1.38, part three 
217 
Theorem 111.41. Let f be a smooth function on a manifold M, and Ma the set 
f-l( (-oo,aj). If f- 1([a,b]) is compact and contains no critical points then Ma 
is homotopy equivalent to Mb. 
Sketch of proof. Fix a Riemannian metric on M. Since f has no critical points in 
f- 1 ([a, b]), the unit vector field X = -V' flllV' fll is well-defined. Extend X to all 
of M. The flow of X gives a retraction of Mb onto Ma. 
0 
Theorem 111.42. Let f be a smooth function on a manifold M. Suppose f- 1([a, b]) 
is compact and contains exactly one nondegenerate critical point p in its interior. 
Then Mb has the homotopy type of Ma with a A-dimensional disk D).. attached 
along the boundary aD).. = 8)..-1 where A is the index of p. 
We omit the proof of the theorem which is well known noting only that the 
key ingredient of the proof is 
Lemma 111.43 (Morse Lemma). Let p be a nondegenerate critical point of index 
A of a function f : M ----t lR. There is a neighborhood U of p in M and an open 
embedding <p : U ----t M such that f 0 <p(x) = f(p) + d2 fp(x) for all x E U. There is, 
there is a change of coordinates near p so that in new coordinates f is a quadratic 
form (up to a constant). 
Moreover, if a compact Lie group G acts on M fixing p and preserving f, we 
may arrange for U to be G-invariant and for <p to be G-equivariant. Note that in 
this case the Hessian d2 fp(x) is a G-invariant quadratic form. 
Suppose now that f is a smooth function on an orbifold M. Then the I-form 
df still makes sense. We define p to be a critical point of f if dfp = o. A critical 
point p is nondegenerate iffor any uniformizing chart (U, r, <p) with p E U = <p(U), 
a point P E <p-l(p) is a nondegenerate critical point of j = f 0 <p. The index of p 
is the index of the r-invariant quadratic form d2 jp. 
It is not hard to believe that Theorem III.41 holds for orbifolds with no 
changes and that essentially the same proof still works. Theorem III.42 requires a 
small modification, see [LTj. 
Theorem 111.44. Let f be a smooth function on an orbifold M. Suppose f- 1 ([ a, bj) 
is compact and contains exactly one nondegenerate critical point p in its interior. 
Then Mb has the homotopy type of Ma with the quotient D)../r attached along the 
boundary (aD)..)/r = 8)..-1/r where A is the index of p and r is structure group 
of p. Here again D).. and 8)..-1 denote the disk of dimension A and the sphere of 
dimension A-I respectively. 
Corollary 111.45. Let f : M ----t JR, p, A and r be as above. Then H*(Mb, Ma; JR) = 
H*(D)../r,8)"-1/r;JR). Hence, ifr is orientation preserving, Hq(Mb, Ma;JR) =JR 
for q = A and 0 otherwise. 
Proof. By excision H*(Mb,Ma;JR) = H*(D)../r,8)"-l/r;JR). If r is orientation 
preserving, then Hq(D).. Ir, 8)..-1 Ir; JR) = iIq(8).. Ir; JR) = JR for q = A and 0 
otherwise. Here iIq denotes the reduced cohomology.

III. Proof of Theorem I.38 
As a consequence of the corollary above we get 
Corollary 111.46. Let f be a smooth function on a compact orbifold M. Suppose 
all indices of f are even. Then Hq(M, JP!.) = 0 for all odd indices q. 
Proof. The proof is inductive. Suppose that c is a critical value of f and suppose 
we know that for all a < c we have Hq (Ma, JP!.) = 0 for q odd. Assume for simplicity 
that f- 1 (c) contains only one critical point (this keeps the notation more manage-
able) and that its index is 2k for some integer k. Then using the long exact sequence 
for the pair (Me+f' Me-f) (for some sufficiently small E > 0) and Corollary III.45 
we see that Hq(Mc+f, JP!.) = Hq (Me- f, JP!.) for q =Ie 2k - 1, 2k, that H 2k- 1 (Me+E' JP!.) 
embeds in H2k-l(Me_E'JP!.) = 0 and that H2k(Me+E'JP!.) = H2k(Me_f'JP!.) EBlF!.. The 
result follows.

Now suppose (M, w, <1> : M ---> g*) is a compact symplectic toric orbifold. Just 
as for symplectic toric manifolds the image <1>(M) is a simple polytope and the 
moment map sends the fixed points MG in one-to-one fashion to vertices of <1>(M) 
(see [LTD. Therefore, for a generic vector X E 9 the function f = 
(<1>, X) takes 
distinct values at fixed points. We will now argue that the critical points of fare 
exactly the fixed points. We will then argue that f is Morse and that all indices 
of f are even. 
For an action of a torus G on a compact orbifold M only finitely many 
isotropy groups can occur. This is a consequence of compactness and existence 
of slices. Therefore the set of subalgebras gx, which are Lie algebras of isotropy 
groups for the action of G on M, is finite. Hence the set 
U = g" U {gx I gx =Ie g} 
xEM 
is open and dense. Now take X to be a vector in U. Then 
0= dfx = d(<1>,X)x = (L(XM)W)x {c} XM(x) = 0 
{c} exptX . x = x for all t 
{c} exp tX E Gx for all t 
{C}XEg y • 
Since X E U we see that dfx = 0 {c} gx = 9 {c} x is fixed by G. It remains to check 
that f is Morse and that all the indices of f are even. 
Let x E MG be a fixed point and let (U, r, cp) be a uniformizing chart centered 
at x (cf. Remark III.39). yve may assume th,~t U = cp(U) i~ G-invariant. Denote 
the symplectic form on U by w. The map <1> = <1> 0 cp : U ---> g* is a moment 
map for an action of a torus G on U. One can show arguing as in the proof of 
Lemma III.6 that reG and that G = G/r. In particular G has 9 as its Lie 
algebra. We now apply the equivariant Darboux theorem to U, wand G. We get 
a G invariant neighborhood V of x = cp-l(X), an open neighborhood 170 of 0 in

TxU and a G-equivariant diffeomorphism T : 0) -7 iT such that T*W = Wo where 
Wo is the constant coefficient form Wx on the vector space TxU. 
The action of G on Tx U is linear. Hence the corresponding moment map 
1>0 : TxU -7 g* is quadratic. In fact by choosing a G-invariant complex struc-
ture on TxU compatible with the symplectic form we can identify (TxU,wo) with 
(en, yCI I:: dZj /\ dzj ) so that the action of G is given by 
for some characters Xj : G -7 3 1 . Then 
where Vj = dXj are the corresponding weights. Since T is a G-equivariant sym-
plectomorphism, 1> ° T = 1>0 + c for some constant c E g*. Hence 
f ° cP ° T = (<1>, X) ° cP ° T = (1), X) ° T = (1)0, X) + c, i.e., 
fOcpOT(Zl, ... ,Zn) = Lv](X)lz]12 +c. 
By the choice of X, v](X) cI 0 for any j. Thus f ° cp is Morse and its index at x 
is twice the number of weights Vj with Vj (X) < O. Therefore, by definition, f is a 
Morse function on M and all indices of f are even. 
Combining the above discussion with Corollary III.46 we get 
Proposition 111.47. Let M be a compact symplectic toric orbifold. Then for any 
odd index q the cohomology group H'I(M, JR.) is zero. 

Appendix 
Hypersurfaces of contact type 
Contact manifolds often arise as codimension 1 submanifolds of symplectic mani-
folds, i.e., as hypersurfaces. 
Definition 111.48. Let (M,w) be a symplectic manifold. A hypersurface E of Mis 
of contact type if there is a neighborhood U of E in M and a vector field X on U 
such that 
1. TmM = TmE EEl IRX(m) for any point m E E, i.e., the vector field X is 
nowhere tangent to E; 
2. the flow of X expands the symplectic form w exponentially, i.e., Lxw = w, 
where as usual Lx denotes the Lie derivative with respect to X. 
The vector field X with above properties is often called a Liouville vector field. 
We now prove that hypersurfaces of contact type are indeed contact mani-
folds. 
Proposition 111.49. Let E be a hypersurface of contact type in a symplectic manifold 
(M, w) and let X be a Liouville vector field defined on a neighborhood U of E. The 
i-form a = (L(X)w)IE is contact. 
Proof. Note first that d(L(X)w) = d(L(X)w) + L(X)dw = Lxw = w. Hence da = 
d(L(X)w)IE = wl~:;. Since w is symplectic and E is of co dimension 1 in M, the form 
W m I1:"'E has a 1-dimensional kernel (for any point m E E). Thus there is a vector 
Ym E TmE such that w",(Yrn, v) = 0 for any v E TmE. Since w is symplectic and 
since by assumption TmM = TmE EEl IRX(m) for all m E E we have 
Hence am =I=- 0 for all m E E and consequently ~ = ker a is a codimension 1 
distribution on E. It remains to show that for any m E E 
is non-degenerate. On the other hand dam = WmlTm E and ~m = {v E Tm E I 
wm(v,X(m)) = O}. Since wm(v, Ym) = 0 for any v E TmE, the subspace ~m of 
TmM lies in the symplectic perpendicular to the 2-plane span]R{Ym' X(m)} in 
(TmM,wm): 
~m C (span]R{Ym,X(m)})w. 
Since dim~m = dimM - 2 = dim(span]R{Ym,X(m)})W, we have equality: 
~m = (span]R{Ym,X(m)})w. Since (span]R{Ym,X(m)}) is a symplectic subspace, 
its symplectic perpendicular ~m is symplectic as well.

Hypersurfaces of contact type 
Example 111.50. Let (Q,g) be a Riemannian manifold. Let g* denote the dual 
metric on T*Q. The co-sphere bundle S*Q is the set of covectors in T*Q of length 
1: S*Q = {(q,p) E T*Q I q E Q, p E T;Q, g;(p,p) = I}. It is a hypersurface of 
contact type in T*Q relative to the standard symplectic structure. The Liouville 
vector field is the generator of dilations. In local coordinates X (q, p) = '£ Pj a~j . 
Exercise 111.51. A codimension 1 hypersurface ~ c en is star-shaped about the 
origin if for any nonzero vector v E en the ray {tv I t E (O,oo)} intersects ~ 
transversely in exactly one point. In particular ~ is the image of an embedding 
~ : s2n-l ~ en of the (2n - I)-dimensional sphere. 
Show that any star-shaped hypersurface is a hypersurface of contact type 
in (en,w = A,£dzj 1\ dzj ). Show that any two star-shaped hypersurfaces are 
isomorphic as contact manifolds. The contact structure in question is called the 
standard contact structure on s2n-l. 
Prove a converse: given a contact form n: on s2n-l defining the standard 
contact structure there is an embedding ~ : s2n-l ----t en such that ~*(~(X)w) = n: 
where X is the radial vector field on en: X (z) = ~ '£ ( Zj a~J + Zj a~J ) .
