Since Darwin, scientists have struggled to reconcile the evolution of seemingly endless biological 
forms with a universe determined by fixed laws. The laws of physics underpin the origin of life, 
evolution, human culture and technology as set by the boundary conditions of the universe; 
however, they cannot predict the emergence of these things. By contrast evolutionary theory 
works in the opposite direction, indicating how selection can explain why some things exist and 
not others. To understand how open-ended forms can emerge in a forward-process from 
physics that does not include their design, a new approach to understanding and quantifying 
selection is necessary that applies across both physics and biology. Herein, we present a new 
theory, Assembly Theory (AT), which accomplishes this not by redefining the laws of physics, 
but instead by redefining the concept of an object that these laws operate on - in AT, objects 
are not considered as point particles, but instead are defined by the set of possible histories of 
their formation as an intrinsic property. Defined in this way, we show how objects themselves 
can provide measurable evidence of selection, whether within the well-defined boundary of an 
individual or selected unit, or not. We formalize by introducing a quantity called Assembly that 
captures how much causation was necessary to produce a given ensemble of objects.  We 
demonstrate this theoretically and show how AT allows novelty generation and selection to 
enter naturally into the physics of complex objects by demonstrating how these can be described 
in a forward dynamical process accounting for the Assembly of objects. By redefining the 
concept of matter in terms of assembly spaces, AT provides a framework to unify descriptions 
of physics and biology in a new physics that emerges at the scale of chemistry where it is that 
history and causal contingency via selection starts to play a prominent role in what exists.

Introduction 
In evolutionary theory, selection1 describes why some things exist and not others, but does so 
retroactively – by looking at what individuals survived.2 This is not useful for explaining or predicting 
the emergence of novelty across chemistry, biology, and technology. Theories of physics do describe 
forward dynamics but achieve this by specifying an initial state3 and evolving that state with a fixed 
set of laws. This means that novelty, i.e., things that are generated which are not predictable from the 
initial conditions, is not possible or must be introduced by randomness.4 The open-ended generation 
of novelty5 does not fit cleanly within either the paradigmatic frameworks of biology6 or physics as 
laid out by Darwin7 and Newton.3  
 
There have been several efforts exploring the gap between physics and evolution,8,9 such as dynamics 
where the laws are allowed to co-evolve with the states and considering the number of states to grow 
as a function of time. When the update rules are a function of the states, this results in systems that 
allow exploration of a larger space of possibilities,10 but it does not solve the problem of where 
genuine novelty comes – the larger space still has a fixed size.  Other efforts have removed the idea 
of a state entirely and studied the evolution of rules acting on other rules,11 however, these models 
are so abstract it is difficult to see how they can describe – and predict – the evolution of physical 
objects. Yet another approach assumes a growing state space as a foundation and explores 
combinatorial spaces and their expansion, such as in the theory of the adjacent possible and related 
theories in statistical mechanics.12 These approaches generates explosive growth in the number of 
possible configurations that cannot be sustained in a finite universe in finite time – these models 
generates novelty but do not include selection. Therefore, the approach lacks predictive power with 
respect to why only some evolutionary innovations happen and not others.  
 
Herein, we introduce assembly theory (AT), which resolves these challenges by describing how 
novelty generation and selection can both operate in forward-evolving processes. The framework of 
AT allows us to not only predict features of novel forms in during selection, but also to quantify how 
much selection was necessary to produce the objects we have observed.13,14 This can be done without 
having to pre-specify individuals or units of selection as selection is defined in terms of observed 
objects, their number of copies and how they can be built. In AT we do not need to get rid of the laws 
as formulated, or add ad hoc explosive expansion of states, instead, we re-invent the concept of an 
object that laws operate on. In AT, objects are not considered as point particles (as in most of physics) 
but instead are defined by the histories of their formation as an intrinsic property. We define this in 
terms of the assembly space. For a given object, the assembly space is defined as the pathways by 
which that object can be built from elementary building blocks, where we use only recursive 

3 
 
operations combining what has already been built in the past. The assembly space captures minimal 
memory, in terms of the minimal number of physical operations necessary to assemble an observed 
object based on objects that could have existed in its past.15   
 
We introduce the foundations of Assembly Theory (AT) and show how it can be implemented to 
quantify the degree of selection and evolution found in an ensemble of observed objects. We 
introduce a quantity, Assembly, built from two empirical observables: (1) the number of copies of 
the observed objects and (2) the objects’ assembly indices, where assembly index is the minimal 
number of steps necessary to produce the object (its size). Assembly therefore quantifies the amount 
of memory necessary to produce a selected configuration of observed objects (with copy number and 
assembly index as coordinates) in a manner similar to how entropy quantifies the information 
necessary (or lack thereof) to specify the configuration (in terms of spatial positions and velocities as 
coordinates) of an ensemble of point particles. We demonstrate how AT leads to a unified language 
for describing selection and the generation of novelty. We thus show how AT provides a framework 
to unify descriptions of selection across physics and biology, with the potential to build a new physics 
that emerges at the scale of chemistry where history and causal contingency via selection start to play 
a prominent role in our interpretation of physical matter.  
 
Assembly Theory 
To quantify the emergence of selection and evolution we define what an object is in AT, and the key 
observable properties of objects so defined - (1) assembly index and (2) copy number.  The concept 
of an object in Assembly Theory is simple and rigorously defined: an object is finite, distinguishable, 
persists over time, and the object is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from 
elementary building blocks are measurable. It should be noted that this definition of objects is in some 
sense opposite of standard physics, which treats objects as fundamental and unbreakable (e.g., the 
concept of ‘atoms’ as indivisible, which now applies to elementary particles). In assembly theory we 
recognize that the smallest unit of matter is typically defined by the limits of observational 
measurements and may not itself be fundamental, and that a more universal concept is to treat objects 
as anything that can be built. This allows us to naturally account for the emergent objects produced 
by evolution and selection as fundamental to the theory.  
 
In principle, an object that exists in a large number of copies, allows the signatures describing the set 
of constraints that built it (the physical rules or laws governing its assembly) to be measured 
experimentally. For example, mass spectrometry can be used to measure the assembly for molecules, 
because it can measure the ways molecules are built by making bonds.16 The concept of copy number 

4 
 
is of fundamental importance in defining a theory that accounts for selection. This is because the more 
complex a given object is, the less likely it is that an identical copy of that object can exist without 
some precise mechanism that has been selected that generates that object. The consequences of this 
point will be explained in detail but simply put, complex objects that exist in high numbers indicate 
the presence of a physical system, itself the product of evolution and selection (e.g., a biological cell, 
technological factory, a human mind etc.), with a memory to build these objects. 
 
Assembly Index and Copy Number 
Assembly index is determined from the physical constraints that allow an object to be built. To 
construct an assembly pathway for an object, one starts from elementary building blocks composing 
that object and recursively joins these to form new structures, where at each recursive step the objects 
formed are added back to the assembly pool and are available for subsequent steps (see SI Section 1 
and 2). For any given object i, we can define its assembly space as all recursively assembled pathways 
that produce it. For each object, the most important feature of its assembly space is the assembly 
index ai, the size of the smallest assembly subspace that contains the object. This can be quantified 
as the length of the shortest assembly pathway which can generate the object, see Fig. 1. 
 
In chemical systems, molecular assembly theory treats bonds as the elementary operations from 
which molecules are constructed. Thus, the shortest path to build the target molecule can be found by 
breaking the molecule into parts by breaking bonds, and then ordering those parts in order of size. 
The ordering is important since we start from the atoms, and add bonds, in sequence. Once we have 
generated a given motif on the path, this motif remains available for reuse. This recursive property is 
important because identifying the shortest recursive path allows us to quantify the minimum number 
of constraints, or memory size, to build the target molecule. Similarly, the assembly index can be 
estimated from any complex discrete object with well-defined building blocks, that can be broken 
apart, as shown in Fig. 1.  
 
Assembly index can be read out directly from the target molecule, and as we will explain later, this 
is an intrinsic property that can be determined experimentally. This may seem like a small detail, but 
it is critically important for distinguishing assembly theory from complexity measures based on 
related but conceptually very different concepts of shortest paths and algorithmic compressibility that 
have emerged from computer science. For example, it is nowadays relatively straightforward to take 
the graph of a molecule and calculate approximations to its algorithmic complexity as the length of 
shortest program that can compute it.

Fig. 1 Assembly index and shortest path(s). AT is general for all classes of objects – here illustrated 
with three different general types: (A) Assembly pathway to construct diethyl phthalate molecule 
considering molecular bonds as the building blocks. The figure shows the pathway starting with the 
irreducible constructs to create the molecule with assembly index 8. (B) Assembly pathway of a 
peptide chain by considering building blocks as strings. Left: shows four amino acids as building 
blocks, Middle: shows the actual object and its representation as a string, Right: Assembly Pathway 
to construct the string. (C) Generalized assembly pathway of an object which is comprised of discrete 
components.  
 
However, these measures are features of the graphical representation of a molecule – and, more 
specifically the program used to compute the graph – and reflect nothing of the physics of how 
molecules are assembled in the real universe. Complexity measures derived from computer science17–

6 
 
19 have no knowledge of chemistry, nor should we expect them to as they were not designed with that 
purpose in mind. As a simple example of where this could go wrong, one could build an “assembly 
space” with operations based on pasting atoms together (molecular alchemy!), instead of making 
bonds, and that would have a different graphical representation and minimal path, representing a 
different algorithm in computer science. And indeed, this could have a shorter minimal path than that 
found in the assembly space. However, this would not have a physical interpretation, because physical 
systems do not build molecules by combining atoms with no bonds – molecules are made by making 
bonds. Assembly theory is not an attempt to reinvent well-trodden concepts from computer science, 
but instead we aim to develop a new understanding of complex matter that naturally accounts for their 
selection and history in terms of what physical operations are permitted by the laws of physics.20,21 
We will discuss assembly theory as applied to molecules as the major application in this paper because 
their assembly index has been experimentally measured. In this case, assembly index has a clear 
physical interpretation and has been validated as quantifying evidence of selection in its application 
to the detection of molecular signatures of life. However, we expect the theory to be sufficiently 
general to apply to a wide variety of other systems including polymers, graphs, images, computer 
programs, and human languages as well as many others. The challenge in each case will be to 
construct an assembly space that has a clear physical meaning in terms of what operations can be 
caused to occur to make the object20, see Fig. 1.  
 
We also note that because assembly pathways are recursive, the process of constructing new objects 
retains the memory of the past formation of objects. This is important because the structure of 
assembly pathways implicitly implies two features of the environment the object is found in: (1) there 
are objects in its environment that can constrain the steps in the pathway and (2) these objects 
themselves have been selected because they must be retained over subsequent steps to physically 
instantiate the memory needed to build the target object. Among the most relatable examples of this 
are enzyme catalysts in biochemistry, which permit the formation of very unlikely molecules in large 
numbers, because the enzymes themselves are also selected to exist with a large number of copies. 
We make no distinction between the traditional notion of biological “individual” and objects that are 
selected in the environment to quantify the selection necessary to produce a given configuration. 
Thus, our approach naturally accounts for well-known phenomenon such as niche construction where 
organisms and environment are co-constructed and co-selected.

the formation of combinatorial object space from building blocks and physical constraints. (B) 
Observed copy number distributions of objects at different assembly indices as an outcome of 
selection or no selection. (C) Representation of physical pathways to construct objects with 
undirected and directed pathways (selected) leading to the low and high copy numbers of the observed 
object. 
 
Copy number is important since a single example of a highly complex molecule (with a very high 
assembly index) does not provide evidence of selection. A single object could potentially be generated 
in a series of random events that become increasingly less likely with increasing assembly index. If 
we consider a forward-building assembly process, without a specific target in mind, the number of 
possible objects that could be built at each recursive step grows super-exponentially in the absence 
of any constraints (see next section and SI Section 1). The likelihood to find and measure more than 
one copy of an object therefore decreases super-exponentially with assembly index in the absence of 
selection for a specific target. As such, finding more than one identical copy indicates the presence 
of a non-random process generating the object. Objects with high assembly index, found in 
abundance, provide evidence of selection because of the combinatorically growing space of possible 
objects at each recursive assembly step, see Fig 2. Notably, only objects with high copy numbers can 

8 
 
have their assembly index measured since it is very hard technically to detect a given single instance 
of an ‘object’ and then infer its assembly index if only one of it exists. Thus, copy number and 
assembly index are intrinsically related. As an example, for the assembly index of molecules, the 
detection of identical molecules using a measurement technique like mass spectrometry requires the 
presence of many thousands of identical molecules.  
 
The Assembly Equation 
For a given ensemble of observed objects, we define Assembly as the empirical quantification of the 
total amount of selection that was necessary to produce that ensemble. We introduce the assembly 
equation (1): 
𝐴𝐴= ෍𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 ൬𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖−1
𝑁𝑁𝑇𝑇
൰
𝑁𝑁
𝑖𝑖=1
 
(1) 
where ai is the assembly index of object 𝑖𝑖, 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 is its copy number and 𝑁𝑁𝑇𝑇 as the total number of objects 
in the ensemble. We normalize by the number of objects in the ensemble such that Assembly between 
ensembles with different number of objects can be compared for quantifying processes such as 
selection. This is quantified within the summation by the distribution of the objects over the range of 
assembly indices. We note that empirical measurements of Assembly will constrain whether the 
associated constants in the Assembly Equation account for natural combinatorial explosion with no 
selection.  
 
The assembly equation quantifies two competing effects (1) the complexity of discovering new 
objects and how (2) once discovered some objects become ‘easier’ to make because the memory has 
been selected for their formation. The exponential growth of Assembly with depth in the assembly 
space (quantified by assembly index) is derived by considering a linearly expanding assembly pool 
which has objects that combine at step 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖→𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+ 1, where an object at the assembly index 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 
combines with another object from the assembly pool. Discovering new objects at increasing depth 
in an assembly space gets harder because the space of possibilities expands exponentially. Once 
discovered, the production of an object (copy number > 1) gets easier as the copy number increases 
because a high copy number implies that an object can be produced readily in a given context. Thus, 
the hardest innovation is making an object for the first time which is equivalent to the discovery, 
followed by making the first copy of that object, but once an object exists in very high abundance it 
must already be relatively easy to make, hence Assembly scales linearly with copy number for more 
than one object.

A consequence of the assembly equation is that increasing Assembly (𝐴𝐴) results from increasing copy 
numbers n and increasing assembly indices a. If high assembly can be shown to capture cases where 
selection has occurred, it implies finding high assembly index objects in high abundance is a signature 
of selection. Along an assembly path, the information required at an assembly step to construct the 
object is “stored” within the object, see Fig. 2. When two objects are combined from an assembly 
pool the specificity of the combination process constitutes selection along an assembly path. As we 
will show, randomly combining objects within the assembly pool at every step does not constitute 
selection because no combinations exist in memory to be used again for building the same object 
again. If instead, certain combinations are preferentially used, it implies there must exist a mechanism 
that selects the specific operations and by extension specific target objects to be generated. We 
quantify the degree of selectivity as 𝛼𝛼, which allows us to parameterize selection in an empirically 
observable manner (by parameterizing how much selection (reuses of specific sets of operations) 
went into generating a given ensemble). We demonstrate that the higher Assembly arises with the 
increase in selectivity. As an example, consider a simple forward process starting with fundamental 
particles, at each step a fraction of objects (𝛼𝛼෤) transforms into a higher assembly object 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖→𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+1 
such that at assembly step t, the copy numbers 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) of objects with assembly index 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 is given by 
(1 −𝛼𝛼෤𝑖𝑖)𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛼𝛼෤𝑖𝑖−1𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖−1(𝑡𝑡) in the presence and the absence of the constraints. The estimated 
assembly (𝐴𝐴) up to 50 assembly steps in shown in Fig. 3C and 3D. 
 
We note that Assembly as given in Eq. (1) is determined for identified unique objects (with copy 
number > 1) and their assembly paths (we define the assembly path as the precise path of interactions 
that leads to the object). However, in real samples, there are almost always multiple coexisting, 
distinguishable objects, which in many cases include a common history for their formation. 
Transistors, for example, are used across multiple different technologies suggesting a common 
assembly subspace that includes transistor-like objects for many modern technologies. This common 
assembly space, constituting the overlap in the assembly path structure of two distinct structures is 
called a joint assembly space. For the generalization of the assembly equation that accounts for the 
joint assembly of objects, we introduce a version of the assembly equation that includes the 
quantification of shared pathways of the objects to determine the Assembly (𝐴𝐴) of an ensemble (see 
SI Section 3).

pool, where at step 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖→𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+ 1, 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 objects are available for the next assembly step. (B) Linearly 
expanding assembly pool with adding one fundamental object at each step where the number of 
possible combinations at the ith step increases exponentially. (C) and (D) show the Assembly of the 
ensemble assuming isolated chains up to 50 assembly steps when  𝛼𝛼෤𝑖𝑖 is constant with the assembly 
index  and when 𝛼𝛼෤𝑖𝑖 scales with assembly index 𝑎𝑎 as 𝛼𝛼෤𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼෤0𝑓𝑓𝑎𝑎, where  𝛼𝛼෤0 is fraction at the first step 
and  𝑓𝑓≤1 represents the increase in constraints with assembly steps. With the increase in 𝛼𝛼 
conversion fraction, objects at higher assembly emerge with higher copy numbers which for an 
isolated chain represents the efficiency of the forward process to construct complex objects. 
 
SELECTION WITHIN ASSEMBLY SPACES   
The concept of the Assembly space allows the understanding of how selection and historical 
contingency imposes constraints on what can be made in the future. A key feature of assembly spaces 
is they are combinatorial because items are combined at every step. More objects exist in assembly 
space than can be built in finite time with finite resources because the space of possibilities grows 
super exponentially with the assembly index. Such combinatorial spaces do not play a prominent role 
in current physics, because current physics often considers objects as point particles and not as 
combinatorial objects (with limited exceptions). However, combinatorial objects are important in 
chemistry, and likewise for biology and technology, where most objects of interest (if not all) are 
hierarchical modular structures. While other work has explored the explosive (super-exponential) 
growth of combinatorial spaces to model the growth of novelty, these have so far not taken historical 
contingency into account. In assembly space, historical contingency is intrinsic, because the space is 

11 
 
built compositionally, where items are combined recursively (accounting for hierarchical 
modularity). It is the combination of the compositionality with combinatorics that allows us to 
describe the selection, see Fig. 4.  
 
To produce an assembly space, an observed object is broken down recursively to generate a set of 
elementary building units. These units can be used to then recursively construct the assembly 
pathways of the original object(s) to build what we call Assembly Observed, 𝑨𝑨𝑶𝑶. 𝐴𝐴𝑂𝑂 captures all 
histories for the construction of the observed object(s) from elementary building blocks, consistent 
with what physical operations are possible.  Because objects in assembly theory are compositional, 
they contain information about the larger space of possible objects from which they were selected. 
To see how, we first build an assembly space from the same building blocks in 𝐴𝐴𝑂𝑂, which includes 
not just the pathways specific to assembling our original observed objects, but all possible pathways 
for assembling any object composed of the same elementary building blocks. The space so 
constructed is what we call the Assembly Universe (𝑨𝑨𝑼𝑼).  
 
 
Fig. 4 Assembly Spaces. (A) Assembly Observed of the three objects shown as graphs (P1, P2, and 
P3) with their shared minimal construction process called their Joint Assembly Space. (B) Illustration 
of the expansion of the Assembly Universe, Assembly Possible, Assembly Contingent, and Assembly 
Observed (see text for details). Note that the figure illustrates only their nested structure but not the 
relative size of the spaces where each set is typically exponentially larger than the subset.  
 
In the Assembly Universe (𝑨𝑨𝑼𝑼) all objects are possible with no rules, allowing a combinatorial 
explosion and hence the size of this space grows as a double exponential characteristic of exploding 
state spaces (adjacent possible), see SI Section 4 for details. While mathematically well-defined, this 
double-exponential growth is unphysical because the laws of physics place restrictions on what is 
possible (e.g., in the case of molecules an example is how quantum mechanics leads to specific 

12 
 
numbers of bonds per atom). For most systems of interest, including in molecular assembly spaces, 
the assembly universe is orders of magnitude larger than the amount of matter available in the 
cosmologically observable universe, so there is no way to iteratively build and exhaust the entire 
space, even for relatively low assembly index objects, but for larger objects like proteins this can be 
truly gigantic22. Because everything can exist, there is an implication that objects can be constructed 
independently of what has existed in the past and of resource or time constraints, which is not what 
we observe in the real universe. We do not observe all possible objects at a given depth in the 
assembly space in the real universe because of selection. We next show how taking account of 
memory and resource limitation severely restricts the size of the space of what can be built, but also 
allows higher assembly objects to be built before exhausting resources constructing all the possible 
lower assembly objects. Assembly theory can account for selection precisely because of the historical 
contingency in the recursive construction of objects along assembly paths.  
 
Assembly Possible (𝑨𝑨𝑷𝑷) is the space of objects physically possible objects, which can be generated 
using the combinatorial expansion of the space using all the known rules of assembly for the objects 
(laws that govern how they can be built combinatorially) and allowing all the rules to be available at 
every step to every object. When an object with Assembly Index 𝑎𝑎 combines with its own history, its 
Assembly Index increases by one, 𝑎𝑎→𝑎𝑎+ 1. If the resulting object can be made via other, shorter 
path(s), its Assembly Index will be smaller than  𝑎𝑎+ 1. If the object combines with another which is 
not in its own history, the combination of them might have an Assembly Index that is larger than 𝑎𝑎+
1 (except if there is a shorter path as discussed above). These two effects may or may not statistically 
cancel. Another assumption behind the dynamical model of undirected dynamics is that it is 
microscopically driven by a stochastic rule that uses existing objects uniformly: the probability of 
choosing an object with Assembly Index 𝑎𝑎 to be combined with another is proportional to 𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎, the 
number of objects in with Assembly Index 𝑎𝑎. We define the probability 𝑃𝑃𝑎𝑎 of an object being selected 
with Assembly Index (𝑎𝑎) as 𝑃𝑃𝑎𝑎∝ (𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎)𝛼𝛼, where 𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎 is the number of objects with Assembly Index a. 
Here, 𝛼𝛼 parameterizes the degree of selection: for 𝛼𝛼= 1 all objects that have been assembled in the 
past are available for reuse, and for 0 ≤𝛼𝛼< 1 only a subset (that grows non-linearly with assembly 
index) are available for reuse, indicating selection has occurred. This leads to the growth dynamics: 
 
𝑑𝑑𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎+1
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
= 𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑(𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎)𝛼𝛼 
(3) 
 
For 𝛼𝛼= 1 there is historical dependence without selection. We build assembly paths by taking two 
randomly chosen objects from the assembly pool, combining them, and if a new object is formed 
adding this back to the pool.  Here we are building random objects, but these are fundamentally 

13 
 
different from random combinatorial objects because the randomness we implement is distributed 
across the recursive construction steps leading to an object. (See SI Section 5 for solutions). The case 
of 𝛼𝛼= 1, where there is historical dependence, but no selection defines the boundary of Assembly 
Possible.  
 
Within Assembly Possible, Assembly Contingent (𝑨𝑨𝑪𝑪), describes the shape of the space of objects 
formed where history, and importantly, selection on that history matters. Historical contingency is 
introduced by assuming only knowledge or constraints built on a given path or graph can be used in 
the future, or with different paths interacting in cases where selected objects that had not interacted 
previously now interact.  Within Assembly Possible, the Assembly Contingent (𝑨𝑨𝑪𝑪) can be found 
where 0 ≤𝛼𝛼< 1 i.e. when selection can operate and the objects found in the space are controlled by 
a path-dependency contingent on each object that has already been built. The growth of the assembly 
selected is much slower growth than exponential; indeed, not all possible paths are explored equally, 
instead, the dynamics are channeled by constraints imposed by the selectivity emerging along specific 
paths. Indeed, a signature of selection in assembly spaces is a slower growth of unique objects than 
exponential growth. To show how, we use a simple linear polymer model as a phenomenological 
model to demonstrate how Assembly can different when selection happens. Starting with a single 
monomer in the assembly pool, the random exploration process combines two randomly selected 
polymers and adds them back to the assembly pool. In the case of selection, we implement here, the 
polymer that has been created most recently is selected to join a randomly selected polymer from the 
assembly pool. For both random construction and selection, this process was iterated up to 104 steps 
and repeated 25 times. For each observed polymer in the assembly pool, the shortest pathway was 
generated (see SI Section 6 for details). For each run, the joint assembly space of all the observed 
polymers in the assembly pool was generated by the union of their shortest pathways, and the graph 
representation of the explored joint assembly space in undirected and directed exploration up to 100 
steps is shown in Fig. 5 A and B. To quantify the degree of exploration at a given assembly step, we 
calculate the exploration ratio which is defined by the ratio of observed nodes and the total number 
of nodes present in the joint assembly space. Fig. 5C shows the exploration ratio and the mean 
maximum assembly index observed (approximated by log2(𝑛𝑛) where 𝑛𝑛 is the length of the polymer) 
for the undirected and directed exploration processes. Comparing the directed process to the 
undirected exploration illustrates a central principle: the signal of selection is simply a lower 
exploration ratio and higher complexity (as defined by the mean assembly index). The observation of 
lower exploration ratio in the directed process as compared to the undirected process is the evidence 
of the presence of the selectivity in the combination process between the polymers existing in the 
assembly pool. Here, the directed process aims to produce longer chains by sorting and selecting 

14 
 
longer chains from the assembly pool for combination restricting the exploration. This is also evident   
observation of polymers with higher assembly index in the case of directed process. The process 
representing sorting and selecting chains within the assembly pool represents an outcome of a 
physical process leading to selection (see SI Section 7 for an additional model).

Our conjecture is that the ‘more assembled’ an object, the more selection is required for it to come 
into existence. The historical contingency in assembly spaces means that assembly dynamics explores 
higher-assembly objects before exhausting all lower-assembly objects, leading to a vast separation in 
scales between the number of objects that could be explored versus those that are actually constructed 
following a particular path. This early symmetry breaking along historically contingent paths is a 
fundamental property of all assembly processes. It also introduces an "assembly time" that ticks at 
each object being made: assembly physics includes an explicit arrow of time intrinsic to the structure 
of assembly spaces.   
 
ASSEMBLY UNIFIES THE EMERGENCE OF SELECTION WITH PHYSICS 
 
In the real universe, objects can only be built from parts that already exist. The discovery of new 
objects is therefore historically contingent. The rate of discovery of new objects can be defined by 
the expansion rate (𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑) introduced in the last section, which describes the rate of formation of unique 
objects in the assembly space from previously existing objects. This introduces a characteristic 
timescale 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 , we define as the discovery time scale. Additionally, once an object is discovered it can 
be reproduced if there exists a mechanism in the environment selected to build it again. Selected 
objects, therefore, increase in copy number, and the copy numbers for these objects must obey mass 
transfer kinetics. Thus far, we have considered discovery dynamics within the assembly spaces which 
do not account for the abundance or copy number of the observed objects once they are discovered. 
To include copy number in the dynamics of assembly spaces we must introduce a second timescale, 
the rate of production (𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝) of a specific object with a characteristic time scale 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 (production time 
scale), see Fig. 6. For simplicity, we assume the selectivity and interaction among the emerging 
objects in assembly space is similar across objects. Defining the two separate timescales for (1) initial 
discovery of an object (𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑), and (2) making copies of existing objects (𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝) allows us to determine the 
regimes where selection is possible, see Fig 6.  
 
For 
𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑
𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝≫1, where objects are discovered quickly but reproduced slowly, the expansion of assembly 
space is too fast under mass constraints to accumulate a high abundance of any given objects, and 
this leads to a combinatorial explosion of unique objects with low copy numbers. This, for example, 
is consistent with how some unconstrained prebiotic synthesis reactions, such as the formose reaction 
end up producing tar, which is composed of a large number of unidentifiable molecules because they 
have low copy number.23 Selection and evolution cannot emerge if new objects are generated on 
timescales so fast that resources are not available for making more copies of objects that already exist. 

16 
 
For 
𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝
𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑≪1, objects are reproduced quickly but new ones are discovered slowly. Here resources are 
primarily consumed in producing additional copies of objects that already exist. New objects are 
discovered infrequently. This leads to a high abundance of objects with low assembly.  Significant 
separation of the two timescales of discovery of new objects and (re)production of selected objects, 
results in either a combinatorial explosion of objects with low copy numbers, or conversely, high 
copy numbers of low assembly objects. In both cases, we will not observe trajectories that grow more 
complex structures.  
 
 
Fig. 6 Selection and evolution in Assembly Space. Assembly processes with and without selection. 
The selection process is defined by a transition from undirected to directed exploration. The parameter 
𝛼𝛼 represents the selectivity of the assembly process (𝛼𝛼= 1: undirected/random expansion, 𝛼𝛼< 1: 
directed expansion). Undirected exploration leads to the fast homogeneous expansion of discovered 
objects in the assembly space, while directed exploration leads to a process that is more like a depth-
first search. Here, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 is the characteristic timescale of discovery, determining the growth of the 
expansion front, while 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 is the characteristic timescale of production that determines the rate of 
formation of objects (increasing copy number). (B) Rate of discovery of unique objects at assembly 
𝑎𝑎+ 1 vs. number of objects at assembly 𝑎𝑎. The transition of  𝛼𝛼= 1 to 𝛼𝛼< 1 represents the 
emergence of selectivity limiting the discovery of new objects. (C) Phase space defined by the 
discovery (𝜏𝜏p) and production (𝜏𝜏d) time scale. The figure shows three different regimes: (1) 𝜏𝜏d ≪
𝜏𝜏p,(2) 𝜏𝜏d ≫𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝, and (3) 𝜏𝜏d ≈𝜏𝜏p. Selection is unlikely to emerge in regimes 1 and 2, and possible in 
regime 3. 
 

17 
 
Therefore, the emergence of selection and open-ended evolution in a physical system would be 
indicated by a transition from  𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝< 𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑 (undirected exploration to create unique objects) to 𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑< 𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝 
(selective dynamics to sustain copy number), see Fig. 6, where there cannot be a large separation in 
the timescales between discovering new objects and reproducing ones that are selected.  
 
Our goal in studying mass action kinetics using assembly theory to describe objects is twofold: (1) 
we aim to show how the generation of novelty can be described alongside selection in a forward-
process (thus unifying key features of life with physics) and (2) we aim to show that in the regime 
where selection is operative, measuring the Assembly (defined in Eq. 1) identifies how much 
selection occurred. We can accomplish both by studying phenomenological models, with the 
understanding we are putting selection in by hand here to demonstrate the principles of how the 
Assembly equation quantifies selection so that it can be applied with confidence to cases where we 
may not know whether or not selection was operative.  
 
Consider a forward assembly process where the copy number of the emerging species follows 
homogeneous kinetics, together with the discovery dynamics as given by equation 3. With the 
discovery of new unique objects over time, symmetry breaking in the construction of assembly paths 
will create a network of growing branches within the assembly space. Consider a simple forward 
assembly process where the concentration of copy number of a single branch is represented by 
𝑛𝑛1(𝑡𝑡) →𝑛𝑛2,𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) → 𝑛𝑛3,𝑗𝑗(𝑡𝑡) →⋯𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎,𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) →𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎+1,𝑞𝑞(𝑡𝑡) … where, 𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎,𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) is the copy number of the 
unique objects at assembly 𝑎𝑎 with index 𝑝𝑝 (likewise defined for assembly 𝑎𝑎+ 1 with index 𝑞𝑞).  We 
assume the production rate constants for producing objects (independent of 𝑝𝑝 and 𝑞𝑞) decrease with 
increasing assembly index by a factor 𝛽𝛽 at each step, with 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓 the initial rate constant at the first step, 
hence 𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝(𝑎𝑎) = 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎. This is a phenomenological choice, motivated by the observation that with 
increasing assembly index, the pathways for the formation of the object have more steps and must be 
more specific: both of these effects lead to a decrease in the production rate relative to less assembled 
objects. As a further simplification, we assume all objects at the assembly index 𝑎𝑎 have the same 
copy number, such that the total number of objects at the assembly 𝑎𝑎 at a given time 𝑡𝑡 is given by 
𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎(𝑡𝑡)𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎(𝑡𝑡). It is important to note that this model is a simple continuum description of the physical 
phenomena of discovery and mass transfer kinetics and because it is continuous it can lead to 
unphysical copy number values of less than one (see SI Section 8 for the complete mathematical 
description of the model). 
 

18 
 
Fig. 7A-E shows the distribution of copy numbers of unique objects (𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎(𝑡𝑡)) up to the dimensionless 
time 109 for assembly indices <=25 and for selectivity parameter 𝛼𝛼= 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0. With 
the increase in 𝛼𝛼 (corresponding to a decrease in selectivity) the number of unique objects increases 
rapidly, leading to a rapid decline in the respective copy numbers of objects over time (Fig. 7A-E). 
The time of unique discovery of an object with copy number 1 increases with the assembly index, 
which is governed by the forward process, see Fig. 7.  
 
 
Fig 7. Dynamics in assembly contingent coupled with kinetics. (A)-(E) Observed Copy numbers 
of unique objects for assembly index 0-25 with 𝛼𝛼= 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0. (F) The total number of 
objects at different assembly indices, which will be equal for all cases independent of 𝛼𝛼. (See SI 
Section 8 for details). (G) Threshold time required to reach copy number: 10 copies of objects at 
different assembly indices at various 𝛼𝛼 values. (H) Assembly of the ensembles vs. time to generate 
the ensembles at various 𝛼𝛼 values. 
 
A key feature of assembly theory is that objects must be observable – that is they should exist in more 
than one copy.  Fig. 7G shows the discovery time defined as the Threshold time when the copy 
number of an object reaches a minimum threshold for detection (in this case we set that value to 10 
copies to illustrate how this works). For a mass spectrometer, this minimal threshold is ca. 10,000 
copies. The threshold time depends on the limitations of measurement (the threshold for detection of 
the object), the discovery and production time scales and the selectivity 𝛼𝛼. As an illustrative example, 
consider a system with fixed selectivity: a fast discovery rate means new objects can be discovered 

19 
 
more rapidly, but a slower production rate would have the effect that it takes longer to achieve the 
minimal threshold copy number for detection. By contrast, with a slower discovery rate, it would take 
longer to discover an object, however that could be compensated by a faster production rate where it 
takes much less time to achieve the threshold copy number once an object is discovered for the first 
time. 
 
To show how Assembly captures when selection has driven the generation of ensembles of high 
complexity, we calculated A for ensembles with varying selectivity 𝛼𝛼 as shown in Fig. 7H. For a 
physical process with no selection (𝛼𝛼≈1), the production process is not sustainable and copy 
numbers decrease rapidly leading to a fall in Assembly over time.  With an increase in selectivity 
(𝛼𝛼< 1), the number of unique products is restricted, and the production process is sustainable over 
higher assembly values as high copy numbers are produced. On the opposite extreme, for the very 
selected and over-constrained processes (𝛼𝛼≈0) few unique products are produced with a very high 
copy number, and the Assembly is low because of the low diversity of objects and low assembly 
indices. 
 
The interplay between the two characteristic time scales describes discovery dynamics (𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑~1/𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑) 
and forward kinetics (𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝~1/𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝) together with selection (characterized by the selectivity parameter 
𝛼𝛼) are essential for driving processes towards creating higher assembly objects. This is characteristic 
of trajectories within Assembly Contingent. Assembly captures key features of how the open-ended 
growth of complexity can only occur within this restricted space by generating new objects with 
increasing assembly, while also producing them with a high copy number. Restricted selectivity (𝛼𝛼<
1) together with comparable time scales (𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑≈𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝) are essential characteristics necessary to produce 
high Assembly ensembles. This is quantified by the Assembly equation which quantifies the degree 
of selectivity that must exist for an observed ensemble, and both the assembly index and copy number 
can be both computed and experimentally measured. The selectivity within an unknown physical 
process can be elucidated by experimentally detecting the number of species, their assembly index, 
and copy number as a function of time. Assuming that the species observed using analytical 
techniques such as mass spectrometry have a high copy number, the discovery rate and the selectivity 
coefficient (𝛼𝛼) can be computed using the rate of formation of new species and current existing 
species at all observed assembly indices. 
Conclusions 
We have introduced the foundations of assembly theory and how it can be implemented to quantify 
the degree of selection and evolution found in an ensemble of objects, agnostic to the detailed 

20 
 
formation mechanisms of the objects or knowing a priori which objects are products of selection (e.g., 
are units of selections or individuals in biology). To do so, we introduce a quantity, Assembly, built 
from two empirical observables of assembly spaces: (1) the number of copies of an object and (2) its 
assembly index, where the assembly index is the minimal number of recursive steps necessary to 
build the object (its size). We demonstrate how AT allows a unified language for describing selection 
and the generation of novelty by showing how it quantifies the generation of novelty and selection at 
the same time in a forward process describing the mass-action kinetics of an ensemble of assembled 
objects. We thus show how AT provides a framework to unify descriptions of selection across physics 
and biology, with the potential to build a new physics that emerges in chemistry where history and 
causal contingency via selection must start to play a prominent role in our descriptions of matter. For 
molecules, computing the assembly index is not explicitly necessary, because the assembly index can 
be probed directly experimentally with high accuracy with spectroscopy techniques including mass 
spectroscopy, IR, and NMR spectroscopy24.
