SE(3) is a Lie group
SE(3) satisfies the four axioms that must be satisfied by the elements of an 
algebraic group:
 The set is closed under the binary operation. In other words, if A and B are any two 
matrices in SE(3),  AB ∈ SE(3).  
 The binary operation is associative. In other words, if A, B, and C are any three matrices ∈ 
SE(3), then (AB) C = A (BC). 
 For every element A ∈ SE(3), there is an identity element given by the  4×4 identity 
matrix, I∈ SE(3),  such that AI = A.
 For every element A ∈ SE(3), there is an identity inverse, A-1 ∈ SE(3), such that A A-1 = 
I.
SE(3) is a continuous group.
z the binary operation above is a  continuous operation  ⎯  the product of  any two 
elements in SE(3) is a continuous function of the two elements
z the inverse of any element in SE(3) is a continuous function of that element. 
In other words, SE(3) is a differentiable manifold.  A group that is a 
differentiable manifold is called a Lie group[ Sophus Lie (1842-1899)].

Differentiable Manifold
Definition
A manifold of dimension n is a set M which is locally 
homeomorphic* to Rn.
R2
dim 2
manifold
Homeomorphism:
A map f from M to N and its inverse, f-1 are 
both continuous.
Smooth map
A map f from U ⊂ Rm to V ⊂ Rn is smooth if 
all partial derivatives of f, of all orders, exist 
and are continuous. 
Diffeomorphism
A smooth map f from U ⊂ Rn to V ⊂ Rn is a 
diffeomorphism if all partial derivatives of f-1, 
of all orders, exist and are continuous.

Actions of SE(3)
M any smooth manifold 
z Think  R3, SE(3), subgroups of SE(3)
A left action of SE(3) on M is a smooth map,  Φ: SE(3) × M →M, 
such that
z Φ(I, x) = x,   x∈M
z Φ(A, Φ(B, x) ) = Φ(AB, x),            A, B ∈ SE(3),  x ∈ M

in {F}. The position and orientation of 
{A} relative to {F} is given by the

Euler’s Theorem for Rotations
Any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid 
body, say O, remains fixed, is equivalent to a rotation about a fixed 
axis through the point O.
The most general rigid body displacement can be 
produced by a translation along a line followed (or preceded) 
by a rotation about that line.
