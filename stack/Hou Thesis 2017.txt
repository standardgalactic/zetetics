Abstract
A vast empirical literature has documented the widespread nature of structural insta-
bility in many macroeconomic time series. In order to accommodate such a feature,
there has been an increasing interest in models that allow time-variation in the pa-
rameters. One important issue for modeling this time-variation is to decide which
type of time-varying processes is more suitable in applications. For instance, one
might want to choose between a model where the parameters are gradually evolving
over time or one in which there are a small number of abrupt change-points. The
objective of this thesis is to investigate the performance of Bayesian mixture models
in modeling such changes in macroeconomic time series.
First, we examine the performance of two basic types of mixture models, a scale
mixture of Gaussian models and a ﬁnite Gaussian mixture model, in forecasting
inﬂation rates of G7 countries. Since it is well-known that many heavy-tailed dis-
tributions can be represented as a scale mixture of Gaussian distributions, we build
upon the frequently employed stochastic volatility (SV) models and allow the error
terms to have different distributional assumptions, such as the t distribution and
double exponential (or Laplace) distribution. The results suggest that allowing for
heavy-tailed distributed error terms is as important as allowing stochastic volatility
in improving point and density forecast accuracy.
Next, we propose a Gaussian mixture innovation model with time-varying mixture
probabilities to detect the in-sample breaks in the relationship between inﬂation and
inﬂation uncertainty. By allowing the time-variation in the mixture probabilities, we
ﬁnd that the proposed model produces more robust estimates and better in-sample
ﬁt. Our empirical study provides strong evidence of the existence of breaks in the
relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty in the last few decades.
Finally, we develop a class of vector autoregressive (VAR) models with inﬁnite hid-
den Markov structures. We ﬁrst improve the computational efﬁciency by developing
a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method built upon the precision-based algorithms.
We then investigate the performance of these inﬁnite hidden Markov models with
various dynamics to predict the US inﬂation, GDP growth and interest rate. The
results show that it is better to model separately the time variation in the conditional

Chapter 1
Introduction
A voluminous literature has highlighted the empirical importance of allowing time-
variation in model parameters for modeling ﬁnancial and macroeconomic variables.
Bayesian mixture models provide a ﬂexible framework for modeling such a feature.
This thesis contributes to this literature by proposing novel Bayesian mixture models
and investigating their properties. It consists of three main chapters ( Chapter 2 -
Chapter 4 ). Each chapter studies the performances of various types of mixture mod-
els in different macroeconomic applications.
In Chapter 2, we compare the forecasting performance of autoregressive (AR) models
with a variety of error distributional assumptions and stochastic volatility speciﬁca-
tions in terms of both point and density forecasts. Conventional priors like uniform
and exponential priors for the degree of freedom parameter have been pointed out
to be inappropriate for estimating the t-distributed error regression model. There-
fore, we compare the forecast performance of models with t-distributed errors under
different prior assumptions. In the context of inﬂation forecast, we provide empiri-
cal evidence to support the claim that some of the main ﬁndings in the US inﬂation
forecast literature seem to be unique but not common to the other G7 countries.
Two main conclusions can be drawn from our forecasting results. First, the prior of
the degree of freedom parameter has little inﬂuence on the forecasting performance
for models with t-distribution errors. Second, the heavy-tailed distributed error as-
sumption and stochastic volatility component more often improve rather than harm
the forecast accuracy in both point forecast and density forecast.
Chapter 3 investigates whether the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation un-
certainty has changed and whether the change in this relationship has been gradual
or abrupt. We extend the time-varying parameter with stochastic volatility in mean
model (TVP-SVM) to include a mixture innovation disturbance in the time-varying
parameter process. The proposed model produces more reliable estimates and al-

Introduction
lows us to investigate the occurrence of breaks in the gradually evolving process of
the time-varying coefﬁcients. Using data from the US, Germany, Canada and New
Zealand, we ﬁnd that: 1) the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
substantially varies over time over the last few decades; 2) there is strong support
for the existence of abrupt changes in the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty relationship;
3) our empirical results for Canada and New Zealand show that the correlation be-
tween inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty has been much weaker since the early 1990s,
which coincides with the timing of the implementation of inﬂation targeting.
Chapter 4 develops a class of vector autoregressive models with inﬁnite hidden
Markov structures. This is motivated by the recent empirical success of hierarchi-
cal Dirichlet process mixture models in ﬁnancial and macroeconomic applications.
We ﬁrst develop a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method built upon the
precision-based algorithms to improve computational efﬁciency. We then investigate
the forecasting performance of these inﬁnite hidden Markov switching models. Our
forecasting results suggest that 1) models with separate inﬁnite hidden Markov pro-
cesses for the VAR coefﬁcients and volatilities in general forecast better than other
speciﬁcations of inﬁnite hidden Markov switching models; 2) using a single inﬁnite
hidden Markov process to govern all model parameters tends to forecast poorly; 3)
most of the gains in forecasting GDP inﬂation and GDP growth seem to come from
allowing for time-variation in volatilities rather than conditional mean coefﬁcients. In
contrast, allowing time-variation in all model parameters is important in forecasting
the short-term interest rate.

Chapter 2
Stochastic Volatility Models with
Alternative Heavy-tailed
Distributions
2.1
Introduction
Many US macroeconomic series have been less volatile since the early 1980s. This
phenomenon is ﬁrst termed as the Great Moderation by Stock and Watson [2003].
Some views about the causes of this reduction in volatility include stabilized eco-
nomic structure, improvement in monetary policy and small shock. Despite the fact
that studies on the causes of the Great Moderation have not come to a consensus
over the last few decades, most recent empirical studies turn out to be in line with a
critical ﬁnding: allowing for time-varying volatility plays an essential role in macroe-
conomic forecast [Stock and Watson, 2007; Clark and Doh, 2011; Chan, 2013; Clark
and Ravazzolo, 2014] and policy making [Cogley and Sargent, 2005; Primiceri, 2005;
Eisenstat and Strachan, 2015]. Recently, Clark [2009] ﬁnds a signiﬁcant increase in
the volatility in the late 2000s. This ﬁnding also highlights the empirical importance
of allowing for time-varying volatility in the recent macroeconomic study.
Two popular families of models are often used to capture the time-variation in volatil-
ity: the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models (GARCH) [Engle, 1982;
Bollerslev, 1986] and the stochastic volatility models (SV) [Taylor, 1994; Jacquier et al.,
2002; Kim et al., 1998]. With the prodigious advance in computational capacity, the
simulation-based econometric inference has been broadly adopted as an alternative
approach to the traditional likelihood-based inference. In the Bayesian econometric
framework, estimation of SV models based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods are computationally tractable. This led to extension and application based
on the SV models have emerged in recent macroeconomic studies [Clark and Doh,

Stochastic Volatility Models with Alternative Heavy-tailed Distributions
2011; Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014; Chan, 2015b; Chan and Eisenstat, 2015].
Several empirical studies have shown that the ﬂuctuation of the US inﬂation is more
likely to be explained by the changes of the variance rather than the conditional
mean coefﬁcients [Primiceri, 2005]. In addition, the ﬁnding that allowing for time-
varying volatility signiﬁcantly improves the forecast performance of a model has
been repeatedly veriﬁed in many recent macroeconomic studies [Clark, 2011; Clark
and Ravazzolo, 2014; Chan, 2013, 2015b]. However this ﬁnding is based on the US
data, there are few studies focus on the forecast performance of the SV models for
other countries’ data. One contribution of chapter is to ﬁll up this gap. This chapter
investigates the inﬂation forecast performance of various speciﬁcations of stochastic
volatility model using data from G7 countries. Our empirical results suggest that
allowing for time-varying volatility does not always guarantee an improvement in
forecast accuracy.
One prominent feature common in many macroeconomic time series is the presence
of outliers. This feature makes the conventional assumption of a Gaussian distributed
error inappropriate in many macroeconomic studies. One popular approach is to as-
sume the error term to follow a t-distribution [Chib et al., 2002; Jacquier et al., 2004;
Nakajima and Omori, 2012; Chan and Hsiao, 2013]. It has been shown that allowing
for a t-distributed error reduces the inﬂuence of outliers and produces more robust
estimates [Maronna and Yohai, 1998; West, 1984; Lange et al., 1989]. In Bayesian
analysis, two priors are often employed in the estimation of the degree of freedom
parameter in t-distributed linear regression models: the uniform prior and the ex-
ponential prior [Jacquier et al., 2004; Chan and Hsiao, 2013; Clark and Ravazzolo,
2014; Geweke, 1993]. However Fonseca et al. [2008] indicate that using these two
conventional priors might lead to unreliable posterior inference. To overcome these
issues, they propose a Jeffreys prior for the degree of freedom parameter for the
t-distributed linear regression model. In this chapter, we compare the forecast per-
formance of t-distributed error models with alternative prior speciﬁcations for the
degree of freedom parameter. It is evident from our results that the prior speciﬁca-
tion for the degree of freedom parameter has little inﬂuence on the forecast perfor-
mance.
Another contribution of this chapter is to investigate the forecast performance of
a model under various error distributional assumptions. In the current literature,
the feature of the heavy-tailedness is often captured by assuming a t-distributed
error term [Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014]. One reason for this is perhaps that the t-

§2.2

5
distribution has a few worthy properties such as being symmetric, bell-shaped and
most importantly it is a limiting case of a Gaussian distribution. As t-distribution is
only one member in the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it is important to inves-
tigate the performance of other types of heavy-tailed distribution in macroeconomic
forecast. However, current literature has paid little attention to this issue.
In this chapter, we investigate G7 inﬂation forecast performance of autoregressive
models with various error structures such as Gaussian distribution, t-distribution,
double exponential distribution and mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Our em-
pirical study enables us to draw a more general conclusion: a model involving a
stochastic volatility component and heavy-tailed error does not always guarantee an
improvement in forecast accuracy, however including these two components seems
to more often improve rather than harm the forecast accuracy.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.2 discusses a few properties
of various error distributional assumptions considered in this chapter. Section 2.3
presents all models in our recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise. Section 2.4
discusses the data and the priors. Section 2.5 brieﬂy discusses the algorithms for
model estimation. Section 2.6 presents forecast metrics and results. Section 2.7 con-
cludes.
2.2
Error Distributions and Motivations
One of the main objectives of this chapter is to investigate the forecast performance
of a model with different error distributional assumptions. We consider four families
of distributions for the error term: 1) the Gaussian distribution, 2) the student-t
distribution, 3) the double exponential distribution and 4) the mixture of Gaussian
distributions. To illustrate the features of these four classes of distribution, we plot
one probability density function from each of these classes, as shown in Figure 2.1.
To facilitate comparison, the density functions plotted are standardized such that
they all have the identical means 0 and variances 2. The density function of the
mixture normal plotted in Figure 2.1 is an equally weighted of a standard Gaussian
distribution and a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 3.

Figure 2.3: Double exponential distribution VS. Gaussian distribution.
As shown in Figure 2.1 - Figure 2.3, greater probability density is concentrated at the
tail of the t-distributions compared with the Gaussian distributions. Similar heavy-
tailed features are also shown in the double exponential probability density func-
tions. To be more speciﬁc, the density functions from different distribution families
have tails with different decay rates. The tail of the Gaussian density functions has
decay rate that is proportional to e−c1x2 for some c1 > 0. In contrast, the decay rates
of the tails for t-distributions and double exponential distributions are proportional
to x−c2 and e−c3x respectively, for some c2 > 0 and c3 > 0. This implies that the
Gaussian density function approaches to zero at the highest rate compared with the
density function of double exponential and t-distribution as x approaches to inﬁnity.
As the tail of a t-distribution decays polynomially and the tail of a double exponen-
tial distribution decays exponentially, the t-distribution has the slowest tail decaying
rate which results in the heaviest tailed density among the three families of distribu-
tions.
Another observation is that the density functions of Gaussian distribution and t-
distribution are bell shaped.
Instead, the density function of double exponential
distribution is not smooth but kinked at its mean. In addition, the density function
of double exponential distribution has a constant exponential decay rate not only at
the tailed part of the distribution, but over the whole support. This leads to a higher
central tendency within a small region around its mean comparing to both Gaussian
distribution and t-distribution. It is well known that the t-distribution converges to
the Gaussian distribution as the degree of freedom parameter approaches to inﬁnity.

Stochastic Volatility Models with Alternative Heavy-tailed Distributions
As such, the Gaussian distribution is a limiting case of the t-distribution, which is
illustrated in Figure 2.2. Similar graph for the double exponential distributions is
plotted in Figure 2.3 for a comparison with standard Gaussian distribution.
Due to the various properties described above, modeling the error term by using
different distributional assumptions allows a model to accommodate the data in a
different way which may effect on the forecast performance of the model. In this
chapter, we conduct a recursive out-of-sample forecast exercise to provide empirical
evidence for justifying this question. Before that, we ﬁrst discuss the models and
data we used in the following sections.
2.3
Models
In this section, we present the models considered in this chapter. To be speciﬁc, we
consider a class of autoregressive (AR) models with different error distributions. We
follow [Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014] by setting the orders of the autoregressive process
as 4, i.e. AR(4). In the rest of this section, we focus on discussion about various error
distributional assumptions.
2.3.1
Models with Constant Variance
First we consider the standard AR(4) model:
yt = β0 + β1yt−1 + β2yt−2 + β3yt−3 + β4yt−4 + ϵy
t ,
ϵy
t ∼N (0, σ2),
where N (·, ·) denotes the Gaussian distribution.
Next, we extend the standard AR(4) model by allowing a t-distributed error term.
In particular, we write the t-distribution as a scale mixture of Gaussian distribu-
tions[Geweke, 1993],
yt = β0 + β1yt−1 + β2yt−2 + β3yt−3 + β4yt−4 + ϵy
t ,
ϵy
t |λt ∼N (0, λtσ2),
λt ∼IG
ν
2, ν


,
where IG(·, ·) denotes the inverse gamma distribution. The scale-mixing variable λt
are assumed to be independent with each other. It can be shown that ϵy
t follows a
t-distribution with scale parameter σ2 and degree of freedom ν when λt is marginal-
ized out.

§2.3
Models
9
Since ν is treated as a parameter to be estimated, we denote the prior distribution for
ν as p(ν). As Fonseca et al. [2008] point out that the prior distribution for ν may lead
to improper posterior analysis. To investigate the inﬂuence of the prior distributions
of ν on the forecast performance for a model with t-distributed error term, we con-
sider three different priors of ν: 1) the exponential prior, 2) the uniform prior and 3)
the Jeffreys prior, where the Jeffreys prior is developed in Fonseca et al. [2008]. We
proceed our discussion on other error structures and postpone the detailed discus-
sion of different prior speciﬁcation in Section 2.4.2.
The third distribution we consider is the double exponential distribution which has
the density function
f (ϵy
t |σ2) = 1
2σe−
|ϵy
t |
σ .
It has a latent variable representation:
ϵy
t ∼N (0, λtσ2),
λt ∼E(1
2),
where E (θ) denotes the exponential distribution with mean θ and variance θ2.
Lastly, we consider a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. To avoid the identi-
ﬁcation issue, we ﬁx one component of this mixture distribution as the standard
Gaussian distribution,
ϵy
t ∼pN (0, 1) + (1 −p)N (0, σ2),
where 0 ≤p ≤1 is the mixture probability. This implies that the error term ϵy
t
follows N (0, 1) with probability p and N (0, σ2) with probability 1 −p. To facilitate
estimation, we rewrite this mixture Gaussian distribution as
ϵy
t |τt = τtN (0, 1) + (1 −τt)N (0, σ2),
Pr(τt = 1) = p,
Pr(τt = 0) = 1 −p,
which means that the mixture component indicator τt follows a Bernoulli distribution
with parameter p. It can be easily shown that the presence of the τt does not affect
the joint posterior distribution of other parameters of interest. More details for the
estimation are referred to the Appendix.

Stochastic Volatility Models with Alternative Heavy-tailed Distributions
2.3.2
Models with Stochastic Volatility
A voluminous literature has highlighted the importance of allowing a time-varying
volatility in modeling and forecasting macroeconomic variables [Cogley and Sargent,
2005; Stock and Watson, 2003; Chan, 2013; Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014]. In the context
of SV models, the time-variation in the volatility is often incorporated into a model
through modeling the log-volatilities. More speciﬁcally, we assume ϵy
t ∼N (0, eht).
Two popular SV speciﬁcations are often used to model the evolving process of the
log-volatility ht. One approach is to assume ht to evolve according to a random walk
process
ht = ht−1 + ϵh
t ,
ϵh
t ∼N (0, σ2
h),
in which the states are initialized with h1 ∼N (0, Vh).
Another alternative is to
assume the log-volatility ht to follow a stationary AR(1) process,
ht = µh + φh(ht−1 −µh) + ϵh
t ,
ϵh
t ∼N (0, σ2
h),
with |φh| < 1, and the states are initialized with the stationary distribution h1 ∼
N (µh, σ2
h/(1 −φ2
h)).
The constant volatility models discussed in Section 2.3.1 can be extended by using
these two SV speciﬁcations. In particular, we consider a general framework for the
error term
ϵ2
y ∼N (0, ηteht).
Modeling the suitable process of the scale-mixing variable ηt allows us to generalize
the conventional stochastic volatility models, such as:
1. model with stochastic volatility: ηt = 1.
2. model with stochastic volatility and t-distributed error: ηt ∼IG(ν/2, ν/2).
3. model with stochastic volatility and double exponential distributed error: ηt ∼
E(1/2).
4. model with stochastic volatility and mixture Gaussian distributed error: ηt|τt =
τt + (1 −τt)σ2 that is equivalent to
τtN (0, eht) + (1 −τt)N (0, σ2eht)

We combine two SV speciﬁcations with various error distributional assumptions and
denote the random walk stochastic volatility as RWSV and the stationary AR(1)
stochastic volatility as ARSV. We also consider the t-distributed error models with
various priors for the degree of freedom parameter. We summarize all model speci-
ﬁcations in Table 2.1.

Data
The data we use are the quarterly inﬂation rates of the G7 countries over the period
1955Q1-2014Q1. More speciﬁcally, given the quarterly price index at time t, PIt, the
inﬂation rate at time t is computed as 400 log(PIt/PIt−1). The price indices (CPI) for
the UK, Germany, Italy and France are obtained from the OECD statistics database.
The price indices for Canada are obtained from the Statistics Canada. For the price
indices of Japan, we ﬁrst obtain the monthly consumer price index from Statistics Bu-
reau of Japan and then compute the quarterly price indices by averaging the monthly
indices in each quarter. The US price indices are obtained from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s Real Time Dataset for Macroeconomists.

- 2014Q1. There are apparent drops in volatility of the inﬂation in the late 1980s for
the US, the UK, Japan, France and Italy. However, it is hard to detect a similar reduc-
tion for Canada and Germany. In contrast, the inﬂation for Canada and Germany
has been ﬂuctuating more steadily within a certain range −around −5% to 15% for
Canada and −4% to 10% for Germany −for the last four decades. It seems that
the volatility of the inﬂation rates for Canada and Germany have not substantially
changed over time. For forecasting Canada and Germany inﬂation rates, including
a stochastic volatility component and heavy-tailed error term might not be useful
for improving forecast accuracy. Our results presented in Section 2.6.2 provide evi-
dence to support this observation. One of our main ﬁndings in this chapter is that
including a stochastic volatility component and heavy-tailed error term into a model
provides little improvement in the forecast accuracy for low volatility data series, but
signiﬁcantly improve the forecast accuracy for high volatility data series.

2.4.2
Priors
We use the same priors for the common model parameters and also assume indepen-
dent prior distributions for all model parameters. In particular, for the models with
constant volatility, the priors for the AR coefﬁcients and the variance are
β ∼N (β0, Vβ)1(β ∈S),
(2.1)
σ2
y ∼IG(νy, Sy),
(2.2)
where β = (β0, . . . , β4)′ and 1(β ∈S) denotes the indicator function such that
1(β ∈S) = 1 if β ∈S and 0 otherwise.
S is the stationarity region where all
roots of the characteristic equation associated with β lie outside the unit circle. We
set νy = 10 and Sy = 9, which implies that the prior mean E(σ2) = 1. For the trun-
cated Gaussian prior, we set β0 = 0 and Vβ = 10.
To investigate the inﬂuence of the prior of the ν on the forecast performance, we

§2.4
Data and Priors
15
consider three priors for ν: 1) the exponential prior, 2) the uniform prior, and 3) the
Jeffreys prior. To be speciﬁc, the probability density functions of these three priors
are
1. Exponential prior:
pE(ν) = 1
8 exp(−ν + 2
8
),
ν > 2.
(2.3)
2. Uniform prior:
pU(ν) = 1
16,
2 < ν < 18.
(2.4)
3. Jeffreys prior:
pJ (ν) ∝

1(ν > 2),
(2.5)
where ψ(x) =
d
dx log Γ(x) and ψ′(x) =
d
dxψ(x) are the digamma and trigamma func-
tions. The restriction ν > 2 guarantees the existence of ﬁrst and second moments of
the t-distribution. It is easy to check that under the uniform prior and exponential
prior, we have E(ν) = 10.
Before we move on, we ﬁrst have a brief discussion about these three priors for the
degree of freedom parameter ν. The uniform prior and exponential priors are often
used in many ﬁnancial and macroeconomic studies [Geweke, 1993; Jacquier et al.,
2004; Chan and Hsiao, 2013; Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014]. However Fonseca et al.
[2008] have shown that these two priors might result in unreliable inference. They
point out that the uniform prior is inappropriate since the estimate of ν is highly
sensitive to where the uniform prior is truncated. For the exponential prior, they also
provide empirical evidence that the posterior estimate of ν is prior dependent. To
overcome these issues, Fonseca et al. [2008] derive the Jeffreys prior for ν. In general,
Jeffreys prior is deﬁned such that it is proportional to the square root of the determi-
nant of the Fisher information matrix. It is well known that Jeffreys prior possesses
two nice properties: 1) it is invariant under reparameterization, 2) it is noninforma-
tive. More details about the Jeffreys prior can be found in Jeffreys [1946]; Kass and
Wasserman [1996].
For models with a mixture of Gaussian distributed error, we assume
p ∼B(p1, p2),

16
Stochastic Volatility Models with Alternative Heavy-tailed Distributions
where B denotes beta distribution. We set p1 = 5.75 and p2 = 5.75. This implies
E(p) = 0.5. For models with the stationary AR(1) stochastic volatility, we use exactly
the same priors for the common model parameters and assume that
φh ∼N (φh0, Vφh)1(|φh| < 1),
µh ∼N (µh0, Vµh),
σ2
h ∼IG(νh, Sh).
We let νh = 10, Sh = 0.09 which implies E(σ2
h) = 0.01. For the prior of the intercept,
we set µh0 = 0 and Vµh = 0.25. For the AR(1) coefﬁcient, we let φh0 = 0.8 and
Vφh = 0.04. The random walk SV speciﬁcation is a special case of the stationary
AR(1) stochastic volatility with φh = 1 and µh = 0. For the initial state of the random
walk SV, we let h1 ∼N (0, Vh) and set Vh = 10. This setting is comparable to those
used in previous studies, such as Clark and Ravazzolo [2014]; Cogley and Sargent
[2005].
2.5
Algorithms
All models are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mod-
els with a stochastic volatility component are estimated using the approach of aux-
iliary mixture sampler of Kim et al. [1998]. Most algorithms of models are standard
and we refer the readers to the discussion in Clark and Ravazzolo [2014]; Chan and
Hsiao [2013]; Koop et al. [2007]. The MCMC algorithms for the AR-t-ARSV-J model
and AR-mixn-ARSV model are provided in the Appendix. It is easy to verify that
most models considered in this chapter are a special case of AR-t-ARSV-J. For exam-
ple, the AR models with constant volatility are equivalent to the AR-t-ARSV-J model
if we set ht = 0 for all t. Models without a heavy-tailed error is a special case of
the AR-t-ARSV-J model if we set the scale-mixing variable λt = 1 for all t. Finally,
to estimate the t-distributed error models with the degree of freedom ν following
the uniform prior or exponential priors, it can easily be achieved by replacing the
corresponding block in the Gibbs sampler. We refer the reader to Chan and Hsiao
[2013]; Geweke [1993] for more details.
2.6
Forecast Metrics and Results
This section ﬁrst discusses the forecast metrics and then presents the results of the
recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise.

§2.6
Forecast Metrics and Results
17
2.6.1
Forecast Metrics
We use y1:t to denote the data up to time t. The posterior mean E(yt+k|y1:t) is used
as the k-step-ahead point forecast. To compute an estimate for E(yt+k|y1:t), we ﬁrst
use the posterior draw obtained from each MCMC iteration after a burn-in period to
simulate the future states from t + 1, · · · , t + k using the relevant transition equations.
Next, we exploit the autoregressive structure of the model to iterate forward along
with the simulated error until a draw yt+k is obtained. We then compute the average
over all posterior draws to produce an estimate for E(yt+k|y1:t).
Let yo
t be the observed value of yt, the metric used to evaluate the point forecasts
is the root mean squared forecast error(RMSFE) which is deﬁned as
RMSFE =

We use two metrics, the average log-predictive likelihoods and the average continu-
ous ranked probability score, to evaluate the density forecast accuracy. The average
log-predictive likelihoods (ALPL) is deﬁned as
ALPL =

where pt+k denotes the k-step-ahead forecast density. There is a close connection
between the predictive likelihood and the marginal likelihood. More detailed discus-
sion of the log-predictive likelihood is provided in Geweke and Amisano [2010].
Another metric used to evaluate the density forecast is the average continuous rank
probability score (ACRPS),

consider the ACRPS as a better scoring rule for measuring the accuracy of density
forecast than the ALPL. The main advantage is that it is deﬁned directly in terms of
the predictive cumulative distribution which provides a consistent measure to com-

pare between deterministic forecast and probability forecast and it is also found to
be less sensitive to outliers [Gneiting and Ranjan, 2012].
2.6.2
Forecasting Results
This section conducts a recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise to compare the
G7 inﬂation forecast performance of those models listed in Table 2.1. We report the
forecasting results at various forecast horizons k = 1 (one quarter), k = 2 (two quar-
ters), k = 4 (one year) and k = 8 (two years). Our forecast evaluation period is from
1975Q1 - 2014Q1. All forecast estimates are computed using 50000 posterior draws
retained after a burn-in period of 20000. For easy comparison, we report the relative
scores to the AR-RWSV benchmark. For the AR-RWSV, we report the actual forecast
estimates. The relative RMSFEs of a given model are the ratios of RMSFEs to those of
AR-RWSV. Hence values less than 1 indicate better forecast performance compared
with the AR-RWSV. For the density forecasts, we report the difference of ALPLs of
a given model to those of AR-RWSV. Thus positive values indicate better forecast
performance. The relative scores for the ACRPSs are the ratio of ACRPSs of a given
model to those of AR-RWSV, then the values less than 1 indicate better forecast per-
formance.
Table 2.2 - Table 2.8 present the forecasting results for each G7 country.
In each
table, panel a) presents the point forecast results, i.e. the RMSFEs and panel b) and
c) present the density forecast results, i.e. the ALPL and ACRPS respectively. To
facilitate comparison, the results are grouped into three panels: the upper panel con-
tains results for models with constant volatility, the middle panel contains results for
models with random walk stochastic volatility and the lowest panel contains results
for models with stationary AR(1) stochastic volatility.

2.6.2.1
Priors for ν
First, we investigate the forecast performance of the t-distributed error models under
various prior speciﬁcations for the degree of freedom parameter. It is evident from
our forecasting results that t-distributed models with various prior speciﬁcations
for the degree of freedom parameter, either with the stochastic volatility or without
the stochastic volatility component, perform similarly for both point and density
forecasts. It suggests that the prior for the degree of freedom has little effect on the
forecast accuracy. According to this ﬁnding, we precede our discussion by simply
denoting all models with t-distributed error as AR-t. Similarly, for models with the
random walk or stationary AR(1) stochastic volatility, we denote them as AR-t-RWSV
and AR-t-ARSV respectively.
2.6.2.2
Point Forecasts
The US inﬂation forecasting results presented in Table 2.2a) show that none of the
AR models consistently outperform the AR-RWSV benchmark. Our results are also
in line with the previous studies of US inﬂation forecast, that models with stochastic
volatility perform better than their counterparts with only constant variance. These
results are broadly consistent with the ﬁndings in [Chan, 2015b; Clark, 2011; Clark
and Ravazzolo, 2014]. However, these ﬁndings do not seem to hold for the other

§2.6
Forecast Metrics and Results
23
G7 countries. For instance, the results for Japan show that both AR-t-RWSV and
AR-t-ARSV strictly outperform the AR-RWSV at all forecast horizons. Furthermore,
the results for Canada and Germany indicate that models with stochastic volatility
do not improve the point forecast performance over their constant volatility counter-
parts. For example, all models produce almost the same point forecast estimates at
all forecast horizons for the Canada inﬂation forecast.
It is evident that, in general, allowing for a t-distributed error term improves the
forecast performance. For example, the results for Japan show that the AR-t model
strictly dominates the AR model. In particular, the RMSFEs evaluated at all forecast
horizons for the AR-t model are at least 8% lower than the values for the AR model.
Among models with a heavy-tailed distributed error term, it is hard to make a con-
clusion about which speciﬁcation of the heavy-tailed distribution, t-distribution or
double exponential distribution, has a better forecast performance. Yet the model
with a double exponential distributed error term performs less stable than the model
with a t-distributed error term. For example, the AR-de model performs the worst
in forecasting the inﬂation of Italy, whereas performs the best in forecasting the in-
ﬂation of Japan.
In general the AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV models perform well in the G7 inﬂation
forecast. None of the models we considered produce sizable and consistent improve-
ments over the AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV models. However, it is unclear of which
speciﬁcation of the stochastic volatility, random walk or stationary AR(1), forecasts
better. Although there are cases for which AR-mixn, AR-mixn-RWSV and AR-mixn-
ARSV perform better than the AR-RWSV, these improvements are more likely to be
occasional and unremarkable.
2.6.2.3
Density Forecasts
The density forecast results are presented in the panel b) and c) of Table 2.2 - Ta-
ble 2.8. The patterns are broadly similar to the point forecast results. Models in-
cluding the stochastic volatility component substantially improve the performance
for forecasting the US inﬂation. The best model for forecasting the US inﬂation is the
AR-RWSV. This is again consistent with the ﬁnding in Clark and Ravazzolo [2014].
Although both AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV models are slightly less accurate than
the AR-RWSV, these losses are relatively small and negligible.
Similar to the point forecast results, adding the stochastic volatility component does

24
Stochastic Volatility Models with Alternative Heavy-tailed Distributions
not seem to improve the density forecast accuracy in forecasting the inﬂation of Ger-
many. It is evident that, in general, both AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV forecast better
than the AR-RWSV. For example, the AR-t-RWSV or AR-t-ARSV perform the best in
forecasting the inﬂation of the UK, Canada, Japan and France whereas for the US,
Italy and Germany, the AR-t-RWSV or AR-t-ARSV models perform quite well. Our
density forecast results also suggest that none of the models we considered produce
notable improvements over the AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV.
A few conclusions can be drawn from our forecasting results. First, adding stochas-
tic volatility and heavy-tailed distributed error term tend to improve both point and
density forecast performances. Second, none of the models considered in this chapter
yield signiﬁcant and consistent improvements over the AR-t-RWSV and AR-t-ARSV.
Third allowing for both stochastic volatility and heavy-tailed distributed error term
does not always guarantee an improvement in the forecast accuracy, but it is more
likely to improve rather than harm the forecast accuracy.
2.6.3
Heavy-tailedness and Stochastic Volatility
It is difﬁcult to conclude which speciﬁcation of stochastic volatility performs bet-
ter in forecasting the G7 inﬂation. In forecasting the US inﬂation, models with the
random walk stochastic volatility outperform their counterparts with the stationary
AR(1) stochastic volatility. However, this ﬁnding is unique and not common to the
other G7 countries. It is evident that many G7 countries seem to be in favor of the
stationary AR(1) speciﬁcation. For example, the density forecast results for Japan
show that models with stationary AR(1) stochastic volatility strictly dominate their
counterparts with the random walk stochastic volatility.
One possible reason that the t-distributed error model tends to outperform the nor-
mally distributed error model is that the degree of freedom parameter is treated as a
parameter to be estimated in our out-of-sample forecasting exercise. As outlined in
Section 2.2, the degree of freedom parameter has a close connection to both the tailed
density of the t-distribution and the Gaussian distribution. In particular, a small
value for the degree of freedom parameter implies a heavier tailed t-distribution. In
contrast, a large value of the degree of freedom parameter makes the corresponding
t-distribution a good approximation to Gaussian distribution. Allowing the degree
of freedom parameter to be estimated along with the other model parameters gener-
alize the Gaussian distributed error model to some extent which is more effective in
capturing outliers in the data.

§2.7
Conclusion
25
The main purpose of allowing a model to include the heavy-tailed error structure
and stochastic volatility component is for reducing the inﬂuence of the outliers and
capturing the time-varying volatility exhibited in data series. One nature question to
ask is whether a model including these two components performs well if outliers and
time-varying volatility do not seem to be present in the data series. Our forecasting
results show that the heavy-tailed error term and the stochastic volatility component
can be treated as the latent components which help to reduce the inﬂuence of the
outliers and to capture the time-varying volatility only when these properties are ex-
hibited in the data series. For example, as demonstrated in Section 2.4.1, the inﬂation
data for Canada and Germany are relatively more stable compared with those for the
other countries. Our forecasting results for Canada and Germany indicate that there
is no signiﬁcant improvement by adding the heavy-tailed error term and stochastic
volatility component.
2.7
Conclusion
This chapter compares the G7 inﬂation forecast performance of autoregressive mod-
els with different error distributional assumptions and stochastic volatility speciﬁ-
cations. Two main conclusions can be made from our results. First, the prior for
the degree of freedom parameter has little inﬂuence on the forecast performance for
models with a t-distribution error term. Second, both the heavy-tailed distributed er-
ror term and stochastic volatility component are important in point and density fore-
casts. Although a model including these two components does not always guarantee
an improvement in the forecast accuracy, they tend to more often improve rather
than harm the forecast accuracy. This implies that the heavy-tailed error term and
the stochastic volatility component can be treated as the latent components which
help to reduce the inﬂuence of the outliers and to capture the time-varying volatility
only when these properties are exhibited in the data series.

another transform

Chapter 3
Time-varying Relationship between
Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
3.1
Introduction
The vast literature on the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
can be traced back to Friedman [1977]. On the theoretical side, Ball [1992] formal-
izes Friedman’s idea through a repeated game between the public and the monetary
authority.
Ball [1992] suggests that policymakers with different reactions to high
inﬂation who alternate power stochastically would generate future inﬂation uncer-
tainty, which predicts that higher inﬂation results in higher inﬂation uncertainty.
On the other hand, Cukierman and Meltzer [1986] build a game-theoretic model in
which the central bank has an incentive to create higher inﬂation uncertainty so as
to exploit the trade-off between inﬂation and unemployment for stimulating output
growth. Thus, their model predicts that higher inﬂation uncertainty causes higher
inﬂation.
Empirical studies on the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
have often reached different conclusions in the direction of higher inﬂation uncer-
tainty causing higher inﬂation. On the one hand, Holland [1995] uses a survey-based
proxy as a measure of inﬂation uncertainty and ﬁnds a negative relationship between
inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty. He suggests that policymakers who view inﬂa-
tion uncertainty as costly are likely to have an incentive to control future inﬂation
to a low level when current inﬂation is high. On the other hand, Grier and Perry
[1998] conduct a cross countries analysis by using one-step ahead conditional vari-
ance from a GARCH model as a proxy for inﬂation uncertainty. Their results show
that a negative relationship exists in countries with more independent central banks,
whereas a positive relationship is found in countries with less independent central
banks. Subsequent research has pointed out that the dispersion of professional eco-
33

Time-varying Relationship between Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
nomic forecast which is used as a proxy for inﬂation uncertainty by Holland [1995]
does not reﬂect the uncertainty of individual forecasters. Hence, this measure may
not be appropriated to be treated as a proxy for inﬂation uncertainty. Furthermore
using the conditional variance estimated by GARCH as a proxy for inﬂation uncer-
tainty, as in Grier and Perry [1998], is also problematic since it does not account for
the structural instability.
To avoid these problems, Grier and Perry [2000] adopt a GARCH in mean (GARCH-
M) model in which the time varying volatility and its impact on inﬂation are jointly
estimated and ﬁnd no evidence that higher inﬂation uncertainty raises the inﬂation
rate. In contrast, Berument et al. [2009] investigate the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty
relationship using stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) model and ﬁnd evidence sup-
porting the view of Cukierman and Meltzer [1986] that higher inﬂation uncertainty
increases inﬂation.
As many recent studies have pointed out the widespread nature of structural in-
stability in many macroeconomic time series [Stock and Watson, 1996, 2007; Cogley
and Sargent, 2002; Kim et al., 2004], Chan [2015b] extends the SVM model of Koop-
man and Hol Uspensky [2002] to allow for time-varying parameters and re-examine
the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty. By allowing the coef-
ﬁcient associated with the volatility in the conditional mean to change over time,
Chan [2015b] ﬁnds substantial time-variation in this relationship using data from
the US, the United Kingdom and Germany. He suggests that models with constant
coefﬁcients are likely to average out the potential time-varying effects which give
misleading results. However, the TVP-SVM model proposed by Chan [2015b] shares
the common drawback of most conventional time-varying parameter models – the
changes in the parameters are restricted in magnitude and do not accommodate the
occurrence of drastic changes immediately [Koop and Potter, 2007]. Instead, a large
level shift in the parameters can only be gradually captured by a sequence of small
changes after the change-point, which may lead to bias estimates and result in unre-
liable inference.
The main goal of this chapter is to investigate the time-varying relationship be-
tween inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty.
To this end, we extend the TVP-SVM
model of Chan [2015b] so as to allow the gradually evolving parameters to have
potential drastic changes. For this purpose, we draw on the mixture innovation ap-
proach [McCulloch and Tsay, 1993; Gerlach et al., 2000; Giordani and Kohn, 2008]
and focus on modeling the time-varying coefﬁcients associated with the volatility

§3.2
TVP-SVM with Time-varying Mixture Innovation Model
35
in the conditional mean. To be speciﬁc, the time-varying parameters are assumed
to evolve as a random walk with a two-component Gaussian mixture innovation.
Conventional mixture innovation model usually assumes the mixture probabilities
to be time-invariant. However we ﬁnd that this setting might not be appropriate
in identifying in-sample breaks. This problem can be surmounted by assuming the
mixture probabilities to be time-varying. We conduct a small simulation study to
shed light on this issue in Section 3.3. In our empirical study, the sensitivity analysis
also shows that the proposed model produces more reliable estimates for detecting
in-sample breaks. More details will be discussed in Section 3.5.3.
We use the proposed model to investigate the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty rela-
tionship for the US, Germany, Canada and New Zealand.
Our empirical results
show that the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty substantially
changes over time, which is consistent with the ﬁndings in Chan [2015b]. Another
important ﬁnding is that it is unlikely the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty relationship
has been gradually evolving over the last few decades. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd a large
downward shift, from positive to negative, in this relationship in the US and Ger-
many during the Global Financial Crisis in the late 2000s.
Our empirical results
strongly suggest that ignoring the potential drastic changes in this relationship may
lead to biased estimates. Lastly, we ﬁnd that the correlation between inﬂation and
inﬂation uncertainty has been much weaker since late 1990s for Canada and New
Zealand which coincides the timing of the implementation of inﬂation targeting.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 presents the new model
for investigating the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty relationship. Section 3.3 conducts
a simulation study. Section 3.4 discusses the posterior sampler for ﬁtting the pro-
posed model. Section 3.5 ﬁrst discusses the data, priors, empirical results and then
conducts a sensitivity analysis and model comparison exercise.
3.2
TVP-SVM with Time-varying Mixture Innovation Model
In this section we discuss the model used to investigate the relationship between
inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty. We extend the time-varying parameter stochastic
volatility in mean model (TVP-SVM) of Chan [2015b] by allowing the time varying
coefﬁcients associated with the volatility in the conditional mean to have a Gaussian

Pr(Kt = 1|πt) = πt,
(3.5)
where N (·, ·) denotes the Gaussian distribution and Kt ∈{0, 1}. The disturbances ϵy
t ,
ϵτ
t , ϵh
t and ϵα
t are mutually and serially uncorrelated. The time-varying volatility, i.e.
eht, is included in the conditional mean as a covariate as shown in equation (3.1). The
log-volatility ht and the state τt are assumed to follow random walk processes. The
variances of the two-component Gaussian disturbance ϵα
t are restricted as σ2
0 < σ2
1.
In contrast to the TVP-SVM model of Chan [2015b], we assume αt follows a random
walk with a mixture Gaussian innovation. We also impose the restriction σ2
0 < σ2
1
that is not only for identiﬁcation purpose but also for detecting drastic changes in the
process of αt. To illustrate how a drastic change can be modeled by a two-component
Gaussian mixture innovation, suppose that we have a sample (z1, . . . , zT) with zt = 0
for t < tb and zt = s for t ≥tb — i.e. a break occurs at tb with break size s. Suppose a
simple random walk process zt = zt−1 + ϵz
t with ϵz
t ∼N (0, σ2
z ) is used to model the
data. Given all observed data up to time tb −1 (z1, . . . , ztb−1), the conditional 90%
credible interval of ztb−1+k is given as (−1.645kσz, 1.645kσz). If the level shift is large,
says s = 5, and we assume σ2
z = 1, then the smallest k for the 90% credible interval
to contain the changed level is 4 ( because s ∈(−1.645 × 4, 1.645 × 4) = (−6.58, 6.58)
). Instead if σ2
z = 10, then this drastic level shift will be located in the 90% credi-
ble interval for k = 1. It is easy to see that the 90% credible interval for k = 1 is
(−1.654
√
10, 1.654
√
10) = (−5.20, 5.20) which contain s. However if the break size
is small, say s = 1, then a Gaussian innovation with small variance, σ2 = 1, will be
better in explaining this change than that with a large variance σ2
z = 10. It is because
the Gaussian likelihood evaluated at s = 1 with σ2
z = 1 which is 0.24 is larger than
the likelihood with σ2
z = 10 which is 0.12.
A few implications can be drawn from this example. First, a random walk process
with innovations that have a small variance is better for modeling gradually evolving
changes. And second, innovations that have a large variance are better for capturing
drastic changes. More importantly, assuming innovations with a small variance, as in

§3.3
Simulation Study
37
most TVP models, one cannot capture a drastic change immediately. Instead, such a
drastic change can only be captured by a sequence of small changes after the change-
point. Our previous example shows that when s = 5 and σ2
z = 1, the random walk
process will take at least 4 steps to allow the 90% credible interval to contain this
change. However, if we assume σ2
z = 10, this drastic change can be captured imme-
diately by only 1 step. In Chan [2015b], the time-varying parameters αt are assumed
to be driven by a single Gaussian innovation with a small variance. Such a setting
is suitable for modeling a gradual evolution in the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty re-
lationship, but it may be inappropriate if drastic changes exist in this relationship.
Our empirical study also provides strong evidence that ignoring the potential drastic
changes in the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty relationship would typically result in
biased estimates.
To allow our proposed model to accommodate both gradually evolving and dras-
tic changes, we adopt the mixture innovation approach [McCulloch and Tsay, 1993;
Gerlach et al., 2000]. The key element to combine the two component Gaussian inno-
vations is the mixture probability πt. Previous studies in modeling structure change
often model the occurrence of breaks, Kt, as an i.i.d Bernoulli process [Koop et al.,
2009; Liu and Morley, 2014], i.e. πt = π for all t. In contrast, our proposed model
assumes that the mixture probability is varying over time as shown in equation (3.5).
The proposed setting is important in identifying in-sample breaks. As we will show
in Section 3.3, our proposed approach performs better in detecting the in-sample
breaks and produces more reliable estimates.

In this section, we conduct a simulation study to investigate the performance of two
types of Gaussian mixture innovation models in identifying small numbers of in-
sample breaks with small break size. Our simulation study shows that compared to
models with an invariant mixture probability, models with time-varying probabili-
ties perform much better in detecting in-sample breaks and are less sensitive to the
sample size.
First, we consider the traditional Gaussian mixture innovation model
yt ∼N (0, σ2
Kt),
Pr(Kt = 1|π) = π,

38
Time-varying Relationship between Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
and refer to this model as M1 where Kt ∈{0, 1} are independent and identically
distributed Bernoulli variables with parameter π.
Second, we consider another Gaussian mixture innovation model where Kt are inde-
pendent but non-identical Bernoulli random variables. To be speciﬁc we consider
yt ∼N (0, σ2
Kt),
Pr(Kt = 1|πt) = πt
and refer to this model as M2. For both M1 and M2, we assume σ2
0 < σ2
1.
To facilitate direct comparison, we assume the same prior for parameters common
across models. For (σ2
0, σ2
1), we assume
(σ2
0, σ2
1) ∼(IG(ν0, S0) × IG(ν1, S1)) 1(σ2
0 < σ2
1),
where IG(·, ·) denotes the Inverse-Gamma distribution and 1(A) is the indicator
function that is equal to one if statement A is true and zero otherwise. In other
words, the prior density of (σ2
0, σ2
1) is a product of two Inverse-Gamma distributions
but truncated so as to satisfy the restriction σ2
0 < σ2
1. We set the shape parameter ν0 =
ν1 = 10 and scale parameter S0 = 0.09 and S1 = 90. For the mixture probabilities π
and πt, we assume
π ∼B(p1, p2),
πt ∼B(p1t, p2t)
where B(·, ·) indicates the Beta distribution. For simplicity, we set the shape pa-
rameters p1 = p1t = 1 and p2 = p2t = 99 for all t = 1, · · · , T. This implies that
E(π) = E(πt) = 0.01 for all t = 1, . . . , T.
To investigate the performance of these two models in identifying in-sample breaks,
we simulate a time series according to
yt ∼N (0, σ2)
for = 1, · · · , tb −1, tb + 1, · · · , T,
(3.6)
ytb ∼N (s, σ2),
(3.7)
where the break date tb is set at ⌈T/2⌉for sample size T with break size s = 0.5.
We set the variance of the disturbance σ2 = 0.01. ⌈z⌉denotes the smallest integer
larger than z. For example, ⌈3.5⌉= 4. Two models discussed before are considered
for detecting the break data tb with break size s by using the posterior mean of Ktb.

§3.3
Simulation Study
39
Our simulation study is conducted as follows, for a given sample size T,
S1: we ﬁrst generate 500 data sets according to equation (3.6) and equation (3.7);
S2: then for each data set i = 1, . . . , 500, we compute the posterior mean of Ki
tb and
denote it as Pi
tb;
S3: lastly, we deﬁne ¯KT
tb =
1
500 ∑500
i=1 Pi
tb as the estimate for sample size T;
We repeat S1 - S3 for sample size T = 500, 1000, · · · , 4500, 5000 and evaluate ¯KT
tb
accordingly. We use the estimate ¯KT
tb for each model, M1 and M2, to measure the
performance of identifying the in-sample breaks. As the time tb is the known break
date in the simulated data series, we expect ¯KT
tb to be close to 1.
Figure 3.1 plots ¯KT
tb against sample size T. A few conclusions can be drawn from
this simulation study. First, M1 consistently produces a lower ¯KT
tb compared with M2
at any given sample size T. In other words, at the known break date tb, M2 performs
better than M1 in identifying the in-sample break. Second, the estimate ¯KT
tb for M1 is
dependent on the sample size T. In Figure 3.1, the estimates ¯KT
tb from M1 are more
likely to be small for a large sample size compared with those for a small sample size.
For example ¯K500
tb
is about 0.7 and ¯K5000
tb
is about 0.55. Third, it is worth stressing that
matching the prior mean of π with the exact ratio of break numbers to sample size
cannot improve the performance of M2, instead it would perform even worse. For
example, for T = 500 the actual ratio of break numbers to sample size is
1
500 = 0.002
which is much less than the prior mean of E(π) = 0.01. For a larger sample size, this
ratio becomes even smaller. This implies that the prior belief of the occurrence of an
in-sample break has already been larger than the actual ratio of the break numbers
to the sample size.
We compare the performance of two types of Gaussian mixture innovation models
in identifying in-sample breaks in this section Our results show that modeling the
mixture probability to be invariant over time, as in most mixture innovation mod-
els, is not appropriate for identifying in-sample breaks. One drawback of this type
of models is that their performance is dependent on the sample size. We ﬁnd that
our proposed approach, in which the mixture probabilities are assumed to be time-
varying, does not suffer from this problem and produces more reliable estimates in
identifying in-sample breaks than does the conventional approach.

Bayesian Estimation
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss the posterior sampler for estimating the TVP-SVM-
TVMI model in (3.1) - (3.5). For notational convenience, we denote y = (y1, . . . , yT)′,
h = (h1, . . . , hT)′, τ = (τ1, . . . , τT)′, α = (α1, . . . , αT)′, π = (π1, . . . , πT)′ and K =
(K1, . . . , KT)′. Posterior draws can be obtained by sequentially sampling from:
1. p(h|τ, α, σ2
τ, σ2
h, K, π, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(h|τ, α, σ2
h, y);
2. p(τ, α|h, σ2
τ, σ2
h, K, π, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(τ, α|h, σ2
τ, K, σ2
0, σ2
1, y);
3. p(σ2
τ|h, τ, α, σ2
h, K, π, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(σ2
τ|τ);
4. p(σ2
h|h, τ, α, σ2
τ, K, π, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(σ2
h|h);
5. p(K|h, τ, α, σ2
τ, σ2
h, π, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(K|α, π) = ∏T
t=1 p(Kt|α, πt);
6. p(π|h, τ, α, σ2
τ, σ2
h, K, σ2
0, σ2
1, y) = p(π|K) = ∏T
t=1 p(πt|Kt) ;
7. p(σ2
0, σ2
1|h, τ, α, σ2
τ, σ2
h, K, π, y) = p(σ2
0, σ2
1|α, K).
In Step 1, we follow the approach of Chan [2015b] and Chan and Strachan [2014] by
exploiting the fact that the Hessian of log p(h|y, α, σ2
h) is a band matrix. A Gaussian
approximation can be obtained and used as a proposal density in an acceptance-
rejection Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In addition, the Hessian of this Gaussian
proposal density is a band matrix, and therefore draws from the proposal density can

41
be obtained efﬁciently using the precision sampler of Chan and Jeliazkov [2009]. The
conditional distribution in Step 2. is Gaussian. To obtain draws from this step we
again adopt the more efﬁcient precision sampler [Chan and Jeliazkov, 2009] instead
of the conventional Kalman ﬁlter-based algorithms. Step 3. - Step 6. are standard,
and it is worth noting that the probability πt of occurrence of a break is time-varying.
In Step 7., since the support of the conditional distribution is truncated as σ2
0 < σ2
1, a
Metropolis-Hastings method is implemented. Full details of the estimation algorithm
are provided in the Appendix.
3.5
Application
In this section, we use the proposed model to analyze the relationship between inﬂa-
tion and inﬂation uncertainty for the US, Germany, Canada and New Zealand. We
ﬁrst discuss data and priors used in our empirical study, then present the full sample
results. At the end, we compare the estimates of our proposed model with those
produced by the traditional mixture innovation model in the sensitivity analysis and
conduct a model comparison exercise.
3.5.1
Data and Priors
The data we used are quarterly CPI inﬂation of the US, Germany, Canada and
New Zealand.
More speciﬁcally, given the quarterly CPI index xt, we use yt =
400 log(xt/xt−1) as the CPI inﬂation.
We use all available data for each country
in the post-World War II period. To be speciﬁc, the CPI inﬂation data for the US,
Canada, New Zealand are from 1947Q1 - 2014Q4. The CPI inﬂation data for Ger-
many are from 1955Q2-2014Q4. All countries selected are either explicit inﬂation
targeting countries like Canada and New Zealand, or behave as inﬂation targeting
countries like the US and Germany. Figure 3.2 displays the quarterly CPI inﬂation
data.
We assume independent priors for (σ2
0, σ2
1), σ2
τ, σ2
h and (π1, . . . , πT). The priors for
(σ2
0, σ2
1) and (π1, . . . , πT) are set to be the same as those discussed in Section 3.3. For
σ2
τ and σ2
h, we assume
σ2
τ ∼IG(ντ, Sτ),
σ2
h ∼IG(νh, Sh).

All state variables are initialized as
τ0 ∼N (0, Vτ),
h0 ∼N (0, Vh),
α0 ∼N (0, Vα).
For the hyperparameters of the prior distributions, we set a large variance for the
prior Gaussian distribution for all initial state variable, Vτ = Vh = Vα = 5 and choose
a relatively noninformative priors by setting ντ = νh = να = 10 and Sτ = 0.5625,
Sh = 0.36 and Sα = 0.09. These imply that Eσ2
h = 0.22, Eσ2
α = 0.12 and Eσ2
τ = 0.252.
These priors are comparable to those used in Chan [2015b].
3.5.2
Full Sample Results
Models are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. All results
are based on 50000 posterior draws after a burnin period of 5000. For a comparison
purpose, we also replicate the estimation results of TVP-SVM of Chan [2015b]. In
Figure 3.3 - Figure 3.6, we plot the estimated posterior means and the 90% credible
intervals of αt in panel (a). In panel (b), we plot the estimated posterior means and
the 90% credible intervals of αt (left axis) alongside with the posterior probabilities
of occurrence of a break P(Kt = 1|y) (right axis). Since the main objective of this
chapter is to investigate the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty,

§3.5

43
for the sake of brevity, other estimation results are presented in the Appendix.
The estimation results for both TVP-SVM and TVP-SVM-TVMI suggest that the re-
lationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty varies substantially over the
last few decades. For example, the estimates of αt for the US, Canada and New
Zealand are positive during the 1970s and then drop almost to 0 in the late 1990s.
This suggests that models that assume time-invariant relationships between inﬂation
and inﬂation uncertainty might not be appropriate.

Figure 3.3: Estimation Results of the US: a) Posterior means and 90% credible intervals of
αt from TVP-SVM; and b) Posterior means and 90% credible intervals of αt (left axis) and
probabilities of occurrence of break P(Kt = 1|y) (right axis) from TVP-SVM-TVMI.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that this relationship not always gradually evolves over time.
The posterior probabilities of break occurrence, P(Kt = 1|y), provide clear evidence
supporting the occurrence of breaks in the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂa-
tion uncertainty for the US, Germany and Canada. Ignoring the existence of breaks
might lead to unreliable inference. In general, the posterior mean of αt produced by
the TVP-SVM is more moderate compared with those produced by the TVP-SVM-
TVMI. One possible explanation for this is that drastic changes in parameters cannot
be captured immediately in traditional TVP models and the effect of such changes
is likely to be averaged out within the estimates during periods where breaks occur.
Evidence of this can be clearly found by taking a close look at the results of the US.
In the early 1980s, a considerable large downward shift is detected by our proposed
model TVP-SVM-TVMI. Before this period, the estimates of the TVP-SVM-TVMI are
mostly around 2, and they decrease instantaneously to almost 0 after the break. In
contrast, the estimates produced by the TVP-SVM are much smaller in the early

44
Time-varying Relationship between Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
1980s, mostly between 1 and 2. They start declining slowly in the early 1980s and
almost reach 0 in the late 1980s. Without taking account of the effects of the break in
the early 1980s, the estimates for αt are more likely to be underestimated before this
period and overestimated after this period.
Table 3.1 reports the ﬁve breaks identiﬁed with the highest posterior probabilities
by the TVP-SVM-TVMI. For example, the posterior probability that a break occurs at
2008Q4 for Germany is 0.54, i.e. P(K2008Q4 = 1) = 0.54. A few breaks are detected by
our proposed model for the US. They are mainly in the late 1950s, early 1980s and
late 2000s. A few previous studies have found that most macroeconomic series of the
US experienced a change in dynamics around the 1950s [Romer and Romer, 2002]
and we also ﬁnd evidence that such an instability exists in the relationship between
inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty. Moreover, in the three decades between 1960 and
1980, inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty are highly positively correlated — all of the
90% credible intervals exclude 0 throughout this period, which is consistent with
recent studies by Berument et al. [2009] and Chan [2015b]. This positive correlation
is maintained until the early 1980s before a signiﬁcant break has been detected at
1981Q3 (with probability 0.45), which results in a steep downward drop in the cor-
relation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty to almost 0. One possible cause
for this drastic change is the contractionary monetary policy in the early 1980s as
the Volcker Federal Reserve focuses more on targeting the inﬂation from the 1980s
than before. Strong support for the existence of a break can also be found in the
late 2000s during the Global Financial Crisis. Interestingly, after the occurrence of
this break, the correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty experiences a
drastic drop from positive to negative. One possible explanation for this result is that
right after the Global Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve may have perceived inﬂa-
tion uncertainty as more costly than pre-Crisis periods. This hypothesis is consistent
with the view of Holland [1995]. Although the 90% credible intervals of αt become
much wider after the Global Financial Crisis period, the intervals all exclude zero,
which provide further evidence supporting a negative relationship between inﬂation
and inﬂation uncertainty.

Germany has a well-known reputation for maintaining a low level of inﬂation over
the past decades. This can be observed in Figure 4.1. Of particular interest to this
study is the fact that with the exception of the late 2000s, the estimates produced
by the TVP-SVM-TVMI are almost identical to those produced by TVP-SVM. Speciﬁ-
cally, the inﬂation-inﬂation uncertainty relationship is mostly between 0 and 1. Nev-
ertheless, similar to the US, an abrupt fall in the estimated posterior mean of αt has
been found and the 90% credible intervals become much wider after the Global Fi-
nancial Crisis. However, unlike the US, it is hard to conclude a positive, or negative,
relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty as the 90% credible intervals
always include 0 throughout the whole sample period. This ﬁnding is consistent
with the results in Grier and Perry [2000].

New Zealand experienced high inﬂation in the 1970s-1980s, see Figure 4.1. To control
the high inﬂation, a few attempts were made by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
in the 1980s. They announced the adoption of inﬂation targeting in the late 1980s

46
Time-varying Relationship between Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
and the inﬂation rate has been successfully controlled at under 5% in the 1990s, see
Sherwin [1997] for more details. We ﬁnd that the inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
are highly positive correlated during the 1970s and 1980s. The 90% credible intervals
of αt produced by both TVP-SVM and TVP-SVM-TVMI exclude 0 during this period,
which provides strong statistical evidence supporting a positive relationship between
inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty. Although a few breaks have been detected by the
TVP-SVM-TVMI, their corresponding posterior probabilities are all smaller than 0.4,
which provides weak evidence supporting the occurrence of breaks during the whole
sample period. We conduct a formal model comparison exercise in Section 3.5.4 for
further investigation of whether modeling the breaks in 1970s-1980s ﬁts the data
better. The αt estimates start decreasing in the early 1990s and remain under 1 in
2000s and their corresponding 90% credible intervals all include 0 between the 1990s
and 2000s. From 1970 to 1980, we ﬁnd evidence to support the view of Cukierman
and Meltzer [1986] that higher inﬂation uncertainty has a positive impact on inﬂation.
However, this highly positive relationship has been weakened since the late 1980s and
drops to nearly zero during the early 1990s, which coincides with the timing of the
implementation of the inﬂation targeting by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

The estimation results for Canada provide strong evidence for the occurrence of a
break in the early 1990s, similar to the result of New Zealand. This also matches
the timing of the adoption of the inﬂation targeting for Canada[Melino, 2012]. The
correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty experiences a drastic drop at
1991Q2 — the probability of occurrence of a break P(K1991Q2 = 1|y) = 0.78 and all

§3.5
Application
47
the 90% credible intervals of αt exclude zero before 1991Q2 and include zero after
1991Q2. One possible explanation for the drop of the correlation between inﬂation
and inﬂation uncertainty for Canada and New Zealand in the early 1990s is that the
inﬂation targeting has been effective in weakening the relationship between inﬂation
and inﬂation uncertainty. However, the results of Canada show that the drop of the
αt estimates is abrupt and permanent. In contrast, the results of New Zealand pre-
sented in Figure 3.6 show that the drop of the αt estimates is more incremental over
time. Similar to New Zealand, the estimation results for Canada also provide strong
evidence of a highly positive correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
in the 1970s and 1980s — as all the 90% credible intervals of αt exclude zero during
this period. This supports the view of Cukierman and Meltzer [1986] that higher
inﬂation uncertainty raises higher inﬂation.

For simplicity, we refer this model as TVP-SVM-MI. We re-estimate models TVP-
SVM-TVMI and TVP-SVM-MI based on a subsample of the US covering the period
1960Q1 - 2005Q4, and then compare with the full sample estimation results. We
choose this subsample because we want to eliminate the volatile periods in the early
1950s and late 2000s. The estimates of the posterior probabilities of the occurrence
of a break P(Kt = 1|y) based on the full sample are plotted in Figure 3.7 and the
subsample estimation results are presented in Figure 3.8. Considering the period of
1960Q1-2005Q4 only, we ﬁnd that the TVP-SVM-MI model in which Kt are assumed
to follow an identical and independent Bernoulli random variables detects more
breaks in the full samplecase but fewer breaks in the subsample case. Furthermore,
the posterior probabilities P(Kt = 1|y) produced by the TVP-SVM-MI are more sensi-
tive to different sample periods. For example, the posterior probability produced by
the TVP-SVM-MI using the full sample is P(K1990Q4 = 1|y) = 0.27, which is almost
four times higher than the subsample estimation result P(K1990Q4 = 1|y) = 0.07.
This ﬁnding suggests that the conventional speciﬁcation is sensitive to the sample
period. In contrast, our proposed model TVP-SVM-TVMI is less sensitive to differ-
ent sample periods. For example, P(K1990Q4 = 1|y) = 0.12 for full sample result and
P(K1990Q4 = 1|y) = 0.05 for subsample result — the drop of the posterior probability
P(Kt = 1|y) is smaller comparing that of TVP-SVM-MI. This is because assuming
that Kt as i.i.d Bernoulli random variables allows the information of occurrence of
breaks in-sample to be shared among each observation which may not be a desir-
able property. The results from the sensitivity analysis help us to conclude that the
proposed model TVP-SVM-TVMI produces more reliable and less sensitive estimates
than those of the traditional approach for identifying in-sample structure breaks.

Model Comparison
In this section, we conduct a model comparison exercise. We use the marginal likeli-
hood as a criterion to compare different models. To be speciﬁc, given model Mi, the
marginal likelihood is deﬁned as
p(yo|Mi) =
Z
p(yo|θi, Mi)p(θi|Mi)dθi,
where yo = (yo
1, . . . , yo
T) is the observed data with sample size T and θi is a vector

50
Time-varying Relationship between Inﬂation and Inﬂation Uncertainty
of the parameters of model Mi. In addition, the marginal likelihood of model Mi
can be rewritten as a product of one-step-ahead predictive likelihoods evaluated at
the observed data. To be speciﬁc, p(yo|Mi) = p(yo
1|Mi) ∏T
t=2 p(yo
t|yo
1, . . . , yo
t−1, Mi).
We will use this expression to compute the marginal likelihood. More discussions
about the marginal likelihood and predictive likelihood can be found in Geweke and
Amisano [2011].
Kass and Raftery [1995] suggest that the evidence in favor of model Mi against Mj
can be interpreted by the relative log-marginal likelihood log p(yo|Mi)
p(yo|Mj) as: not worth
more than a bare mention if 0 ≤log p(yo|Mi)
p(yo|Mj) < 1; positive if 1 ≤log p(yo|Mi)
p(yo|Mj) < 3;
strong if 3 ≤log p(yo|Mi)
p(yo|Mj) < 5; very strong if 5 ≤log p(yo|Mi)
p(yo|Mj).

Table 3.2 reports the log-marginal likelihood of each model. The log-marginal like-
lihoods of the TVP-SVM-MI and TVP-SVM-TVMI are very close to each other. As
we have shown in Section 3.5.3, the estimation results of model TVP-SVM-TVMI are
more reliable. Hence, the following discussion will focus on comparing the TVP-
SVM and the TVP-SVM-TVMI.
The log-marginal likelihoods are very similar for Germany, Canada and New Zealand.
This suggests all three models ﬁt the data equally well. This ﬁnding is not surpris-
ing. As we can see in Figure 3.4 - Figure 3.6, the estimation results of αt for the
TVP-SVM and TVP-SVM-TVMI are very similar. For example, the estimated 90%
credible intervals of αt for Canada and New Zealand exclude zeros in 1970s-1980s
and include zeros in 1990s-2000s. Although the posterior means of αt incur an abrupt
downward shift in the results of Germany in late 2000s, there is no strong evidence
that supports these values are signiﬁcantly different from zero. However, for the re-
sults of the US, the difference of the log-marginal likelihoods between TVP-SVM and
TVP-SVM-TVMI is 4.5. Based on the criterion suggested by Kass and Raftery [1995],
there is strong evidence in favor of the TVP-SVM-TVMI compared to TVP-SVM. The
results of the log-marginal likelihood further emphasize the empirical importance of
the proposed model.

Conclusion
This chapter re-examines the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
for the US, Germany, Canada and New Zealand. We extend the stochastic volatil-
ity in mean model with time-varying parameter by allowing the time-varying co-
efﬁcient associated with the volatility to include a mixture of Gaussian distributed
errors. This allows us to investigate whether the changes in the inﬂation-inﬂation
uncertainty relationship have been gradual or abrupt over time. There are three key
ﬁndings. First, we ﬁnd substantial time-variation in the relationship between inﬂa-
tion and inﬂation uncertainty over the last few decades for the US, Germany, Canada
and New Zealand. Second, we ﬁnd strong evidence of the existence of breaks in
this relationship. A large change has been found in the US during the Global Finan-
cial Crisis. Interestingly, the correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty
drops from positive to negative after this break. Third, from the results of Canada
and New Zealand, we ﬁnd that the correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation un-
certainty has been weakened since the early 1990s which coincide with the timing of
the implementation of inﬂation targeting. A sensitivity analysis is conducted based
on a subsample of the US and we ﬁnd that our proposed model produces more
reliable estimates in identifying in-sample breaks than the traditional mixture inno-
vation model. Lastly, the results of the model comparison exercise provide evidence
which highlight the empirical importance of our proposed model.

MCMC Estimation Algorithm
In this Appendix we provide the details of the estimation procedure for the TVP-
SVM-TVMI model given by equation (3.8) - (3.12). The posterior draws can be ob-
tained by sequentially sampling from Step 1. - Step 8. in section 3.4. To obtain sample
from Step 1. we follow the approach of Chan [2015b] and Chan and Strachan [2014]
by exploiting the feature of the band matrix of the Hessian of log p(h|τ, α, σ2
h, y).
Then a Gaussian proposal can be obtained efﬁciently for an acceptance-rejection
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To be speciﬁc, ﬁrst note that by Bayes’ rule, we have
p(h|τ, α, σ2
h, y) ∝p(y|τ, α, h)p(h|σ2
h),
where the log-likelihood log p(y|α, h, τ) = ∑T
t=1 log p(yt|αt, ht, τt). Then a second-
order Taylor expansion around an arbitrary point ˜h = (˜h1, . . . , ˜hT)′ is given by
log p(y|α, h, τ) ≈log p(y|τ, α, ˜h) + (h −˜h)′f −1
2(h −˜h)′G(h −˜h)
= −1

where c1 is a normalizing constant which is independent of h, f = ( f1, · · · , fT)′ and

∂ht
log p(yt|αt, ht, τt)|ht= ˜ht,
Gt = −∂2
∂h2

log p(yt|αt, ht, τt)|ht= ˜ht.
It is worth stressing that the diagonal matrix G is the negative Hessian of the log-
likelihood evaluated at ˜h, which is the key to obtain efﬁcient Gaussian proposal for
the acceptance-rejection Metropolis-Hastings step. The log-likelihood is given by
log p(yt|αt, ht, τt) = −1

which is the ﬁrst order difference matrix. Then rewrite the state equation of ht in
matrix form,
Hh = ϵh,
ϵh ∼N (0, Ωh),
where Ωh = diag(Vh, σ2
h, · · · , σ2
h). That is, (h|σ2
h) ∼N (0, (H′Ω−1
h H)−1) with log-
density
log p(h|σ2
h) = −1
2(h′H′Ω−1
h Hh) + c2,
where c2 is a normalizing constant independent of h. Finally we obtain
log p(h|y, α, τ) = log p(y|τ, α, h) + log p(h|σ2
h) + c3
≈−1
2(h′Khh −2h′kh) + c4,
where c3 and c4 are constants independent of h, Kh = H′Ω−1
h H + G and kh =
f + G ˜h. It can be shown that this is the log-kernel of the N ( ˆh, Kh−1) density, where
ˆh = Kh−1kh. In other words, p(h|y, α, h) can be approximated by the Gaussian
density with mean vector ˆh and precision matrix Kh. The Gaussian approximation
is then used as the proposal density in the acceptance-rejection Metropolis-Hastings
step. We choose ˜h to be the mode of p(h|y, α, τ). To quickly locate ˜h, we apply the
Newton-Raphson method. To be speciﬁc, Kh is the negative Hessian and the score
vector of log p(h|y, α, τ) evaluate at h = ˜h is −Kh ˜h + kh. Given a initial value h0,
for t = 0, 1, 2, · · · , evaluate Kh and kh at ˜h = h(t) by iterating
h(t+1) = h(t) + Kh−1(−Khh(t) + kh) = K−1
h kh,
until some convergence criterion is reached, e.g. ||h(t+1) −h(t)|| < ϵ for some pre-
ﬁxed tolerance level ϵ.
To obtain draws from Step 2., we denote γt = (τt, αt)′, γ = (γ′

p(Kt = 0|α, πt) ∝p(α|Kt)p(Kt = 0|πt) ∝(1 −πt)φ(αt −αt−1; 0, σ2

where φ(x; µ, σ2) denotes the Gaussian density with mean µ and variance σ2 evalu-

In Step 6, since (π1, . . . , πT) are conditionally independent given (K1, . . . , KT), we
can sample each of them sequentially. By Bayes’ rule, we have
p(πt|Kt) ∝p(Kt|πt)p(πt)
= (πt)Kt+p1−1(1 −πt)1−Kt+p2−1,
which then implies that πt|Kt ∼B(Kt + p1, 1 −Kt + p2), where B(·, ·) denotes the

Estimation Results
In this section we provide the estimation results for model TVP-SVM, TVP-SVM-MI
and TVP-SVM-TVMI. The posterior means and standard deviations of model param-
eters for each country are reported in Table 3.3 - Table 3.6. The results obtained are
similar to those in previous studies. The acceptance rate of the acceptance-rejection
Metropolis-Hastings step to sample h for each model is higher than 90%, which in-
dicates that the Gaussian proposal approximates the full conditional distribution of
h well in this estimation step. The acceptance rate of the Metropolis-Hastings step to
sample (σ2
0, σ2
1) of each model is close to 100%. These results are expected because of
the tight priors imposed on (σ2
0, σ2
1) and πt.

4.1
Introduction
A voluminous literature has highlighted the widespread nature of structural insta-
bility in macroeconomic time series [Stock and Watson, 1996; Cogley and Sargent,
2002; Kim et al., 2004; Koop and Potter, 2007]. In order to accommodate such a fea-
ture, there has been an increasing interest in models that allow for time-variation in
both conditional mean coefﬁcients and volatilities. There are two popular families
of models often used in this line of study: time-varying parameters models with
stochastic volatility (TVP-SV) [Cogley and Sargent, 2005; Primiceri, 2005; Liu and
Morley, 2014; Koop et al., 2009; Chan and Eisenstat, 2015] and Markov switching
(MS) models [Sims and Zha, 2006; Geweke and Amisano, 2011; Hubrich and Tet-
low, 2015]. Many recent studies have compared alternative speciﬁcations of TVP-SV
models and found that allowing for time-variation in conditional mean coefﬁcients
and volatilities is important in improving forecast accuracy [D’Agostino et al., 2013;
Clark, 2011; Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014]. However, there are few papers that focus
on the forecast performance of MS models, especially in the multivariate setting.
This chapter contributes to the current literature by developing vector autoregressive
models with inﬁnite hidden Markov structures. To improve computational efﬁciency,
we develop a new MCMC sampling method built upon precision-based algorithms.
We then investigate the point and density forecast performances of these inﬁnite hid-
den Markov switching (IHM) models based on US quarterly GDP inﬂation, GDP
growth and short-term interest rate.
Most recent macroeconomic studies of structural break models and Markov switch-

ing models are restricted to univariate models1. Koop and Potter [2007] extend the
structural break model of Chib [1998] by allowing the number of structural breaks to
be unknown and estimated from data. On the other hand, Giordani and Kohn [2012]
model the random number of structural breaks within the framework of Gaussian
state space model through mixture distributions in the state innovations. Bauwens
et al. [2014] conduct a large forecasting exercise to compare various types of struc-
tural break models and highlight the importance of structural breaks in macroeco-
nomic forecast. As pointed out by Song [2014], structural break models may incur
a loss of estimation precision, because pre-break data are not directly used in the
estimation of parameters of the new born regimes. To this end, he proposes an IHM
model with a second hierarchical structure on the model parameters. To allow richer
dynamics, Bauwens et al. [2015] extend the IHM model by imposing two independent
inﬁnite hidden Markov processes which are respectively governing the conditional
mean coefﬁcients and the volatilities. However, they have not investigated the fore-
cast performance of IHM models with different types of dynamics. In addition, all
these studies are limited to univariate models and have paid little attention to the
key practical problem of multivariate macroeconomic forecasting under the struc-
tural instability. We make two main contributions to the current literature. First, we
extend the IHM models into the framework of vector autoregressive models. Second,
we evaluate the forecast performance of IHM models with various dynamics in both
univariate and multivariate setting.
The IHM model is a nonparametric model built upon the hierarchical Dirichlet pro-
cess of Teh et al. [2006], which extends the conventional MS models to allow for
a possibly inﬁnite number of regimes. One of the main advantages of IHM mod-
els over MS models is that its number of regimes for an IHM model needs not be
predetermined before estimation. For a traditional MS model, selecting the num-
ber of regimes is essential for both in-sample inference and out-of-sample forecast
performance. This is often done by comparing or averaging models with different
numbers of regimes using a model comparison criterion [Hubrich and Tetlow, 2015;
Jochmann and Koop, 2015]. However, conducting such a comparison in general is
tedious and computationally demanding. More importantly, it may not be feasible
for high dimensional multivariate models. Motivated by the recent empirical success
of the IHM models in many empirical ﬁnance and macroeconomic studies [Jensen
and Maheu, 2014; Song, 2014; Jochmann, 2015; Maheu and Yang, 2015], we adopt the
IHM model approach and extend it into the multivariate setting. To capture the state

parameters when a break occurs.

persistence we consider the sticky version of IHM model in this chapter. We provide
a brief discussion about this model in section 4.2 and refer the readers to Fox et al.
[2011] for more details.
First, we contribute to this emerging research by developing vector autoregressive
models with inﬁnite hidden Markov structures. A vast literature has highlighted the
empirical importance of allowing for time-variation in both conditional mean coefﬁ-
cients and volatilities, especially in macroeconomic forecast [Stock and Watson, 2007;
D’Agostino et al., 2013; Clark, 2011; Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014; Chan, 2013, 2015a].
However, most of these studies are based on the TVP-SV models. For MS models, as
a competitive counterpart of TVP-SV models, there are few studies in the literature
that focus on the comparison of MS model with various dynamics. The main purpose
of this chapter is to ﬁll this gap. To be speciﬁc, this chapter compares the forecast
performance of alternative IHM models within the AR and VAR speciﬁcation and try
to address the following three main issues: 1) whether the IHM model improves the
forecast accuracy upon the time invariant AR or VAR models; 2) whether the ﬁndings
in the literature of TVP-SV models are consistent to those of IHM models; 3) which
speciﬁcation of IHM models performs better comparing with other speciﬁcations.
The second contribution of this chapter is to propose an algorithm to improve the
computational efﬁciency of estimating IHM models. In order to simulate the regime
parameters, the conventional sampling approach requires regrouping date according
to different regimes. This approach can be slow since the number of regimes for an
IHM model is treated as random and it is possible that a large number of (active)
regimes might be realized in some speciﬁc MCMC iterations. Our proposed algo-
rithm allows us to simulate the parameters in distinct regime efﬁciently. The main
idea is from the literature of nonparametric additive regression [Jeliazkov, 2008]. To
be speciﬁc, selection matrices are constructed on the ﬂy during the estimation process
which helps quickly reordering the data corresponding to distinct regimes. By ex-
ploiting the selection matrices, the precision-based algorithm of Chan and Jeliazkov
[2009] can be used to simulate parameters in distinct regime efﬁciently.
Third, our recursive out-of-sample forecast exercise shows that time-variation in
model parameters is important for both point and density forecasts. Most of the
gains in forecasting GDP inﬂation and GDP growth seem to come from allowing for
time-variation in volatilities rather than conditional mean coefﬁcients. In contrast,
allowing for time-variation in conditional mean coefﬁcients and volatilities are both
important in improving forecast accuracy for short-term interest rate. In addition,

62 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
models where breaks of all model parameters occur at the same time in general have
poor forecast performance. Furthermore, none of the alternative speciﬁcations of
IHM models consistently outperform the model with two independent inﬁnite hid-
den Markov process: one governs the changes of the conditional mean coefﬁcients
and one governs the changes of the volatilities.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows.
Section 4.2 brieﬂy discusses the
Dirichlet process and its associated mixture models. Section 4.3 presents various
speciﬁcations of IHM models.
Section 4.4 develops an efﬁcient algorithm for es-
timation.
Section 4.5 ﬁrst conducts a posterior analysis, followed by a recursive
out-of-sample forecasting exercise to evaluate the forecast performance of various
speciﬁcations of IHM models in both univariate and multivariate settings. Section
4.6 concludes.
4.2
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss the Dirichlet process (DP) which is the main build-
ing block of inﬁnite hidden Markov switching models. The Dirichlet process, de-
noted by DP(c, G0), is ﬁrst introduced by Ferguson [1973] and deﬁned as a distri-
bution on distributions. It is parameterized by a base distribution G0 over a sample
space Θ, and a positive concentration parameter α. For illustrative purpose, we leave
the base distribution G0 unspeciﬁed at this stage. Suppose G ∼DP(c, G0). It can be
shown that G has the following stick-breaking representation [Sethuraman, 1994]:
G =
∞
∑
i=1
piδθi,
(4.1)
where δk is the degenerate probability measure at k and θi ∼G0 for i = 1, 2, . . .. The
probability weights p = (p1, p2, . . .) are obtained from a stick-breaking process
Vi ∼B(1, c),
pi = Vi
i−1
∏
j=1
(1 −Vj),
(4.2)
where B(·, ·) represents the Beta distribution.
We denote the process in (4.2) as
p ∼SBP(c). It is worth noting that a draw p ∼SBP(c) satisﬁes ∑∞
i=1 pi = 1 and can
be interpreted as a distribution over natural number. Intuitively, the process in (4.2)
can be thought of as breaking a stick of unit length inﬁnitely many times. At the ith
time of breaking the stick, a draw Vi ∼B(1, c) will determine the proportion of the
remaining stick to be broken.

§4.2
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
63
The discrete nature of the DP makes it well suited for a prior in nonparametric
mixture modeling. Let (y1, . . . , yT) be the variables of interest. The generic form of a
Dirichlet process mixture model can be written as
yt|st, {θi}∞
i=1 ∼F(θst),
(4.3)
θi ∼G0,
(4.4)
st ∼p,
(4.5)
p ∼SBP(c),
(4.6)
where st is the state variable taking values over natural number and F is a distri-
bution parameterized by θi. We leave F to be unspeciﬁed for now and will discuss
more about it in section 4.3. The Dirichlet process mixture model described above
can be thought of as an extension of the ﬁnite mixture model to an inﬁnite number
of mixture components. However, the lack of state dependency makes the Dirichlet
process mixture model less suitable for time series analysis. To this end, Teh et al.
[2006] introduce a hierarchical DP prior to a set of Dirichlet process mixture models.
This allows those Dirichlet process mixture models to be related and share informa-
tion to each other through the hierarchical structure. The inﬁnite hidden Markov
switching model is one important variant of the hierarchical DP mixture model. Its
generic form can be represented as
yt|st, {θi}∞
i=1 ∼F(θst),
(4.7)
θi ∼G0,
(4.8)
st|st−1, {pi}∞
i=1 ∼pst−1,
(4.9)
pi|c, π ∼DP(c, π),
(4.10)
π|γ ∼SBP(γ),
(4.11)
From equation (4.9), we can see that the state variable st follows a ﬁrst order Markov
process. As each pi is an inﬁnite dimensional vector, st can be thought of as following
a Markov process which is governed by an inﬁnite dimensional transitional matrix.
In addition, all pi are drawn from the common distribution DP(c, π), this allows
them to learn and share information with each other.
As many macroeconomic time series are evolving with high persistence, the sticky
version of the Dirichlet process prior is more suitable in modeling such a feature [Fox
et al., 2011]. To be speciﬁc, the sticky version of an inﬁnite hidden Markov switching

64 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
model is deﬁned as the same as (4.7) - (4.11) but with equation (4.10) replaced by
pi|c, π ∼DP(c, (1 −ρ)π + ρδi),
(4.12)
where 0 < ρ < 1 is referred as the sticky parameter which reinforces the state self-
transition probability. As different values of parameters (c, γ, ρ) reﬂect different belief
of the hidden Markov process, instead of setting them to speciﬁc values, we treat
them as parameters to be estimated.
A brief overview of the MCMC estimation
is presented in section 4.4. More details are provided in the Appendix. We refer
readers to Teh et al. [2006]; Jochmann [2015] for more discussions about the DP and
its associated mixture models.
4.3
Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VAR
In this section, we discuss three speciﬁcations of inﬁnite hidden Markov switching
vector autoregressive model.
To set the stage, let (y1, . . . , yT) be the T observed
variables of interest and each yt is a n × 1 vector. We consider a VAR(q) model:
yt = cst + A1,styt−1 + · · · + Aq,styt−q + ϵt,
ϵt ∼N (0, Σst),
(4.13)
where N (·, ·) denotes the Gaussian distribution, cst is an n × 1 vector of intercepts,
A1,st, . . . , Aq,st are n × n coefﬁcient matrices and Σst is the n × n covariance matrix.
We rewrite equation (4.13) as a linear regression model
yt = Xtβst + ϵt,
ϵt ∼N (0, Σst),
(4.14)
where βst = vec
 (cst, A1,st, . . . , Aq,st)′
is kβ × 1 with kβ = n(nq + 1) and Xt = In ⊗
(1, y′
t−1, . . . , y′
t−q). The time-variation of the VAR coefﬁcients βst and covariance Σst
are determined by the regime indicator variable st ∈{1, 2, . . .} which is following a
inﬁnite hidden Markov process:
st|st−1, {pi}∞
i=1 ∼pst−1,
(4.15)
pi|c, ρ, π ∼DP(c, (1 −ρ)π + ρδi),
(4.16)
π|γ ∼SBP(γ),
(4.17)
(βi, Σi) ∼G(β,Σ),
(4.18)
where G(βi,Σi) denotes the base distribution which generates the regime parameters.
We refer the model (4.14) - (4.18) as IHM-VAR(q). The IHM-VAR(q) assumes that
both βst and Σst are governed by a single inﬁnite hidden Markov process. This im-

§4.3
Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VAR
65
plies that the breaks in the VAR coefﬁcients and the volatilities have to occur at the
same time.
To allow for richer dynamics, we also consider a version that incorporates two in-
dependent inﬁnite hidden Markov processes: one governs the changes of the VAR
coefﬁcients and the other governs the changes of the volatilities. To be speciﬁc, we
consider the model:
yt = Xtβst + ϵt,
ϵt ∼N (0, Σzt),
(4.19)
st|st−1, {ps
i}∞
i=1 ∼ps
st−1,
(4.20)
ps
i|cs, ρs, πs ∼DP(cs, (1 −ρs)πs + ρsδi),
(4.21)
πs|γs ∼SBP(γs),
(4.22)
zt|zt−1, {pz
i }∞
i=1 ∼pz
zt−1,
(4.23)
pz
i |cz, ρz, πz ∼DP(cz, (1 −ρz)πz + ρzδi),
(4.24)
πz|γz ∼SBP(γz),
(4.25)
βi ∼Gβ,
Σi ∼GΣ.
(4.26)
We refer to this VAR model which consists of double inﬁnite hidden Markov pro-
cesses as DIHM-VAR(q). The main difference of DIHM-VAR(q) from IHM-VAR(q) is
that the variations of βst and Σzt depend respectively on st and zt, which are inde-
pendent of each other. This can also be seen by comparing the base distributions in
equation (4.18) and (4.26). In IHM-VAR(q), all model parameters are generated from
a single base distribution G(β,Σ). In contrast two base distributions, Gβ and GΣ, are
incorporated in DIHM-VAR(q) which generates βst and Σzt independently.
Many studies have found that the conditional mean coefﬁcients of a VAR model are
less likely to be varying over time [Primiceri, 2005; Koop et al., 2009; Chan and Eisen-
stat, 2015]. Based on this reason, we consider a VAR model with constant conditional
mean coefﬁcients:
yt = Xtβ + ϵt,
ϵt ∼N (0, Σzt),
(4.27)
zt|zt−1, {pz
i }∞
i=1 ∼pz
zt−1,
(4.28)
pz
i |cz, ρz, πz ∼DP(cz, (1 −ρz)πz + ρzδi),
(4.29)
πz|γz ∼SBP(γz),
(4.30)
Σi ∼GΣ,
(4.31)
and we refer to this model as C-VAR(q)-IHM.

66 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
To complete model speciﬁcation, we specify our base distribution of DIHM-VAR(q)
and IHM-VAR(q) as,
βi ∼N (β0, V0),
Σ−1
i
∼W(Σ−1
0 , ν0).
(4.32)
For C-VAR(q)-IHM, we assume the priors for the VAR coefﬁcients and base distribu-
tion of the covariance matrix as
β ∼N (βc, Vc),
Σ−1
i
∼W(Σ−1
0 , ν0).
(4.33)
As proposed by Song [2014], imposing a second hierarchical structure on the base
distribution allows for regime parameters in the new born regime to learn from
the existing regimes, which helps improving the forecast accuracy. We follow his
approach and set the second hierarchical priors as
β0 ∼N (β00, B00),
V−1
0
∼W(A00, a00),
Σ0 ∼W(Q00, b00),
ν0 ∼E(λ00)1(ν0 > n),
(4.34)
where W(S, ν) denotes the Wishart distribution with scale matrix S and degrees of
freedom ν. E(λ) denotes the exponential distribution with mean λ. The indicator
function 1(ν0 > n) implies that the support of the prior for ν0 is restricted to be
greater than n. Lastly, we assume the hyperparameters (cs, cz, γs, γz, ρs, ρz) to follow
independent priors given as
cs ∼G(ws, θs),
γs ∼G(hs, ηs),
ρs ∼B( fs, gs),
(4.35)
cz ∼G(wz, θz),
γz ∼G(hz, ηz),
ρz ∼B( fz, gz),
(4.36)
where G(κ1, κ2) denotes the Gamma distribution with mean κ1/κ2 and variance
κ1/κ2

Bayesian Estimation
This section provides an overview of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) pos-
terior sampler for model estimation. To be concise, we focus on the estimation pro-
cedure of the DIHM-VAR(q) model. Only minor modiﬁcations are needed for the
estimation of the other models.
For notational convenience, let s = (s1, . . . , sT),
z = (z1, . . . , zT), Hs = (cs, γs, ρs), Hz = (cz, γz, ρz), Φ = (β0, V0, Σ0, ν0) and Ps =

.
Since IHM models allow for a
possibly inﬁnite number of states, the algorithm of Chib [1996] that handles a ﬁnite
number of states cannot be applied. One approach is to work only with a large ﬁnite
number of states to approximate the IHM model [Fox et al., 2011; Jochmann, 2015].
In contrast, we follow the approach of beam sampler proposed by Van Gael et al.
[2008] for obtaining samples from the exact posterior distribution.
To apply the beam sampler, auxiliary variables us = (us
1, . . . , us
T) and uz = (uz
1, . . . , uz
T)
are introduced such that they are sampled alongside with the other model parame-
ters, but they do not change the marginal distributions of the other model parame-
ters. To be speciﬁc, for each t, us
t is introduced with conditional density
p(us
t|st−1, st) = p(us
t, st|st−1)
p(st|st−1)
=
1(0 < us
t < ps
st−1st)
psst−1st
.
(4.37)
We suppress the rest of the conditioning variables for notational simplicity. This im-
plies that the joint density of (us
t, st) given st−1 is p(us
t, st|st−1) = 1(0 < us
t < ps
st−1st).
Apparently, marginalizing out us
t returns the original model. Hence sampling us
alongside with the other model parameters does not change the marginal distribu-
tions of the other model parameters. In addition, the conditional density of st given
(us
t, st−1) is
p(st|us
t, st−1) =
1(0 < us
t < ps
st−1st)
∑i 1(0 < us
t < ps
st−1i).
(4.38)
As ∑i ps
st−1i = 1, it is not hard to see that the set {i : 0 < us
t < ps
st−1i} is ﬁnite. This
implies that, given us, there is only a ﬁnite number of state trajectory needed to be
considered. Thus the algorithm of Chib [1996] can be applied to obtain samples of
the state variables s. The samples for the state variables z can also be obtained using
a similar approach. More details about the beam sampler can be found in Van Gael
et al. [2008] and the Appendix.
The posterior draws for the DIHM-VAR(q) model can be obtained by sequentially
sampling from:
1. p(Θ|s, z, πs, πz, Ps, Pz, us, uz, Hs, Hz, Φ, y1:T) = p(Θ|Φ, s, z);
2. p(Φ|s, z, πs, πz, Ps, Pz, Hs, Hz, us, uz, Θ, y1:T) = p(Φ|Θ, s, z);
3. p(us, uz|s, z, πs, πz, Ps, Pz, Hs, Hz, Θ, Φ, y1:T) = p(us, uz|s, z, Ps, Pz)
4. p(s, z|πs, πz, Ps, Pz, Hs, Hz, us, uz, Θ, Φ, y1:T) = p(s, z|Ps, Pz, πs, πz, us, uz, Θ, y1:T);

68 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
5. p(πs, πz|s, z, Ps, Pz, Hs, Hz, us, uz, Θ, Φ, y1:T) = p(πs, πz|s, z, Hs, Hz);
6. p(Ps, Pz|s, z, πs, πz, us, uz, Hs, Hz, Θ, Φ, y1:T) = p(Ps, Pz|s, z, πs, πz, Hs, Hz);
7. p(Hs, Hz|s, z, πs, πz, Ps, Pz, us, uz, Θ, Φ, y1:T) = p(Hs, Hz|s, z, Ps, Pz).
A regime is said to be active if at least one observation belongs to it. It is worth
noting that conditional on the auxiliary variables us and uz, there is only a ﬁnite
number of active regimes. We denote Ls and Lz as the numbers of active regimes
implied by s and z respectively. To improve computational efﬁciency, we propose
an efﬁcient way to obtain samples from p(Θ|Φ, s, z) in step 1. The idea is from the
literature of nonparametric additive regression [Jeliazkov, 2008]. In our proposed
approach, selection matrices are constructed on the ﬂy in each MCMC iteration to
avoid explicitly regrouping the data into distinct regimes. To be speciﬁc, we ﬁrst
stack all T observations and rewrite equation (4.19) as
Y = XeB + ϵ,
ϵ ∼N (0, Ω),
(4.39)

and Y = (y′

It is important to note that only the VAR coefﬁcients for distinct active regimes,
B = (β′
1, . . . , β′
Ls)′, are needed to be sampled in each MCMC iteration. To improve
efﬁciency, we deﬁne a T × Ls selection matrix Ds which has entry Ds(i, j) = 1 if si = j
and 0 otherwise. It is easy to check that eB =

B. Hence equation (4.39) can
be written as
Y = XsB + ϵ,

We make two remarks on the computation. First, it is important to observe that the
kβLs × kβLs matrix V−1
B
is block-banded i.e., all non-zero elements are concentrated
around the main diagonal. This structure can be exploited to efﬁciently compute bB
without calculating the inverse of V−1
B . In addition, the precision-based sampler of
Chan and Jeliazkov [2009] can be applied to quickly obtain draws from N (bB, VB).
Second, in principle the number of active regimes in the framework of IHM model
can be as large as the sample size T. In the traditional approach, parameters are
sampled sequentially after regrouping the data into distinct regimes in each MCMC
iteration. The computational efﬁciency is low especially when a large number of ac-
tive regimes is realized at some speciﬁc MCMC iterations. Our proposed approach
vectorizes all the operations through constructing selection matrices on the ﬂy dur-
ing estimation, which is very fast in programming environments such as MATLAB,
GAUSS and R.

Table 4.1 reports the time taken to obtain 10000 posterior draws for various types
of IHM models with 2 lags. The computational times for two univariate IHM mod-
els, DIHM-AR and IHM-AR, are also reported2. More speciﬁcally, the DIHM-AR
(IHM-AR) is the DIHM-VAR (IHM-VAR) with n = 1. We use U.S. quarterly GDP
inﬂation rate, GDP growth and short-term interest rate from 1954Q3 - 2015Q1 with
a total of T = 241 observations. We will discuss more about the data in the next

Application
In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the data and priors used in the empirical study of
this chapter. We then report some full sample posterior estimates of two IHM mod-
els, DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2), to illustrate a few properties of IHM models
with different dynamics.
Lastly, a recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise is
conducted to evaluate the forecast performance of alternative speciﬁcations of IHM
models.

Data and Priors
The data are U.S. quarterly inﬂation rate computed from the GDP deﬂator, GDP
growth and short-term interest rate from 1954Q3 - 2015Q1. The GDP deﬂator and real
GDP are transformed to annualized growth rates. For example, given GDP deﬂator
(real GDP) xt we use yt = 400log(xt/xt−1) as the GDP inﬂation (GDP growth). The

estimation times for GDP inﬂation rate, GDP growth and short-term interest rate.

from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. We plot the data in Figure 4.1.

For easy comparison, we assume the same prior for parameters common across mod-
els. We set informative priors for those hyperparameters of the base distribution. In
particular we set the hyperparameters βc = β00 = 0, Vc = B00 = Ikβ, a00 = kβ + 10,
A00 = 2a00Ikβ, Q00 = b−1
00 In, b00 = 5, λ00 = n + 2. For the priors of those hidden
Markov parameters, we set ws = wz = 5, θs = θz = 1, hs = hz = ηs = ηz = 1.
For the sticky parameters, we set fs = fz = 10 and gs = gz = 1 which implies a
relatively high self-transition probability. As univariate models often forecast well,
we also compare the forecast performance of different types of AR(q) models with
various IHM structures. For each VAR(q) or AR(q) model, we consider q = 1, 2 for
the lag order.
We report the full sample estimates in section 4.5.2 and the out-of-sample forecast-
ing results in section 4.5.3. All estimates are based on 50000 posterior draws after
a burn-in period of 5000. One main identiﬁcation issue for mixture models is la-
bel switching. Ignoring this may result in misleading inference. However, Geweke
[2007] shows that inference on the label invariant statistics are valid and can be con-
ducted by as usual. Hence, all estimates reported in the following sections are label
invariant.
4.5.2
Posterior Analysis
This section presents some full sample estimation results for the DIHM-VAR(2) and
IHM-VAR(2). The estimation results show substantial time-variation in both the VAR
coefﬁcients and volatilities over the sample period. The main difference between the
DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) appear in the estimated posterior volatilities but not

72 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
VAR coefﬁcients. More importantly, it is also evident that breaks of the parameters
are not likely to occur at the same time.
Figure 4.2 - Figure 4.5 plot the estimated posterior means (solid lines) for the VAR
coefﬁcients and covariance matrices with the corresponding 68% credible intervals
(dashed lines) for the DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2). In Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3,
each row plots the coefﬁcients for one equation and each column reports the coef-
ﬁcients for one variables. For example, the third panel in the ﬁrst row plots the
coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst lagged GDP growth in the equation of inﬂation.
Overall, the estimates of the VAR coefﬁcients from both models are mostly the same
over the sample period. There are cases that the estimated 68% credible intervals
of some coefﬁcients for DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) almost exclude each other,
but the difference of their posterior means are small. For example, in the equation
of interest rate, the 68% credible intervals of the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst lag interest
rate for DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) barely exclude each other in most periods,
however, the difference of their posterior means is only around 0.2.
Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 plots the estimates of the covariance matrices for the DIHM-
VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) models. We use 1, 2, 3 to label the equation of inﬂation, GDP
growth and interest rate accordingly. Thus, σij denotes the covariance of innovations
in equation i and equation j. For example, σ11 is the variance of the innovation in
the equation of inﬂation. The estimated covariance matrices for both models indicate
that the volatilities of the innovations are typically high in the 1970s, followed by a
decline in the early 1980s. This ﬁnding is generally consistent with the studies of the
Great Moderation [Chan and Eisenstat, 2015; Primiceri, 2005; Sims and Zha, 2006].
However, the estimates for the DIHM-VAR(2) detect a drastic rise in volatilities dur-
ing the Global Financial Crisis in the late 2000s. In contrast, there are no notable
changes have been found in the volatilities during the whole 2000s from the esti-
mates of the IHM-VAR(2). Furthermore, the estimated covariance among variables
for the IHM-VAR(2) are much larger comparing with those for the DIHM-VAR(2) in
this high volatile period.

Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7 display the estimated posterior distributions of the num-
bers of the active regimes for the DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2). These ﬁgures
show that the regime uncertainty has been taken into account by both models. More-
over, it is obvious that the shapes of these posterior distributions are very different
from each other. As there is only one inﬁnite hidden Markov process for the IHM-
VAR(2) to drive the time-variation of all model parameters, it is not surprising that
the IHM-VAR(2) tends to use more regimes to explain the uncertainty of the model

To further investigate on how the data are categorized into different regimes, we plot
the T × T heat maps in Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 (see, e.g., Geweke and Jiang [2011];
Song [2014]; Maheu and Yang [2015] ). A heat map displays the posterior proba-
bilities that the regime indicators of different time periods have the same value, i.e.
Pr(si = sj|y1:T) ( or Pr(zi = zj|y1:T) ) for i = 1, . . . , T, j = 1, . . . , T. To be speciﬁc,
the lighter (darker) the colour is in a ceil (i, j) of a heat map, the higher (lower) the
probability that the time i and time j are clustered into the same regime. From the
heat maps of the DIHM-VAR(2), it is evident that the clustering of regimes for the
VAR coefﬁcients and the volatilities are quite different over time. For instance, the
right panel of Figure 4.8 shows clearly that the regimes for the volatilities are not
likely to be recurrent over time. However, on the left panel of Figure 4.8, there is no
visible distinct regime can be found for the VAR coefﬁcients.
To shed light on whether the breaks of the VAR coefﬁcients and volatilities oc-
cur at the same time, we plot a weighted heat map for the DIHM-VAR(2), i.e.

2 Pr(zi = zj|y1:T) along side with the heat map associated with
the IHM-VAR(2) in Figure 4.9. Again, these two heat maps show very different pat-
terns from each other. It provides strong evidence supporting that the break points
of the VAR coefﬁcients and volatilities occur at different time periods. More interest-
ingly, although the estimates for both models indicate a high volatile period in the
1970s, their heat maps tell a very different story. For the DIHM-VAR(2), this highly
volatile period is likely to be clustered into one or two regimes. However, for the
IHM-VAR(2), this period is categorized into many distinct regimes.

heat map for the IHM-VAR(2) (right).
A few implications can be drawn from the results reported in this section. The es-
timation results show substantial time-variation in the parameters of both models.
The main difference between the DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) appears in the es-
timates of volatilities rather than the VAR coefﬁcients. More importantly, it is evident
that the breaks for the VAR coefﬁcients and volatilities are not likely to occur at the
same time. In addition, it is worth noting that even though some of the estimated
parameters for both models seem to share some similarities, but the latent dynamics,
as shown in Figure 4.6 - Figure 4.9, are quite different. As various types of IHM
model are likely to possess different features, it is important to investigate which
type of these models has better forecast performance. To this end, we proceed by
conducting a formal recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise in the next section.
4.5.3
Forecasting Results
This section performs a recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise to evaluate the
performance of the models discussed in section 4.3.
We evaluate the iterated h-
step-ahead forecasts of each model with h = 1 (one quarter), h = 2 (two quarters),
h = 4 (one year), h = 8 (two years). Our forecast evaluation period is from 1970Q1 -
2015Q1.

78 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
4.5.3.1
Forecast Metrics
Let yo
t+h be the observed value of yt+h and y1:t denotes the data up to time t. We
compute the h-step-ahead predictive posterior median ˆyt+h as the point forecast for
a given model. The mean absolute forecast error (MAFE) is used to measure the
accuracy of the point forecast of a model, which is deﬁned as
MAFE =
1
T −h −t0 + 1
T−h
∑
t=t0
yo
t+h −ˆyt+h
 .
For evaluating the performance of density forecasts, we use the average log-predictive
likelihoods (ALPL) which is deﬁned as
ALPL =
1
T −h −t0 + 1
T−h
∑
t=t0
log pt+h(yt+h = yo
t+h|y1:t),
where pt+h denotes h-step-ahead predictive density function. y1:t denotes the given
the data up to time t. The log-predictive likelihood is often used to compare forecast
performance of models in Bayesian framework since there is a close connection be-
tween the predictive likelihood and the marginal likelihood. More discussions about
the log-predictive likelihoods can be found in Geweke and Amisano [2011].
To facilitate comparison, the relative scores to the benchmark models, AR(1) for the
univariate models and VAR(1) for the multivariate models, are reported. More specif-
ically, we report the ratios of MAFEs of a given model to those of the benchmark.
Hence values less than unity indicate better point forecast performance than the
benchmark. For density forecasts, we report the difference of ALPLs of a given mod-
els to those of the benchmark. Thus positive values indicate better density forecast
performance than the benchmark.
4.5.3.2
Point Forecasts
Table 4.2 - Table 4.5 report the relative MAFEs and ALPLs. For each table, the fore-
casting results for GDP inﬂation, GDP growth and short-term interest rate are pre-
sented in panel a), panel b) and panel c) respectively. Our point forecast results,
shown in table 4.2, suggest that allowing for time-variation in model parameters
is important in improving the accuracy of point forecasts. None of the models we
consider produce sizable and consistent improvements over DIHM-VAR(2) for fore-
casting GDP inﬂation, GDP growth and short-term interest rate. Although the IHM-
VAR(1) and IHM-VAR(2) tend to outperform the DIHM-VAR(2) on forecasting the

§4.5
Application
79
short term GDP inﬂation, these improvements are not likely to be shared for fore-
casting the other variables. For example, the IHM-VAR(2) performs relatively worse
at forecasting the short-run interest rate. It is worth noting that most of the gains in
forecast accuracy appear to have come from allowing for time-variation in the VAR
coefﬁcients. This can be shown by comparing the performance of the DIHM-VAR(2)
with C-VAR(2)-IHM. For example, both DIHM-VAR(2) and C-VAR(2)-IHM produce
almost the same forecast estimates for all variables at various forecast horizons.
For AR models, the patterns of the point forecast results shown in Table 4.3 are
broadly similar to those of VARs. The DIHM-AR(2) is always among the top fore-
casting models. Likewise, most of the forecasting gains appear to have come from al-
lowing for time-variation in volatilities. Even through allowing the AR coefﬁcients to
be time-varying tends to improve the point forecast performance, such improvements
are likely to be small. These results are in general consistent with those ﬁndings in
the literature of TVP-SV models [Clark and Ravazzolo, 2014; Chan, 2015a].

80 Inﬁnite Hidden Markov Switching VARs with Application to Macroeconomic Forecast
4.5.3.3
Density Forecasts
We report the results of density forecasts in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. For both VAR
and AR models, it is apparent that models allowing for time-variation in parameters,
either in the VAR coefﬁcients or volatilities, substantially outperform the benchmarks
at all forecast horizons. Among the VAR models with inﬁnite hidden Markov com-
ponent(s), the DIHM-VAR(2) performs the best at all horizons in forecasting GDP
inﬂation, GDP growth and short-term interest rate. With AR models, the patterns
are mostly the same as those of VAR models. Except in the case of forecasting short-
term interest rate, the DIHM-AR(2) and IHM-AR(2) perform quite similarly at short
horizons, however, the IHM-AR(2) tends to be forecasting better than the DIHM-
VAR(2) at longer horizons.

To investigate the forecast performance of IHM models at different period of time, we
plot the one-quarter-ahead cumulative sums of log-predictive likelihoods in Figure
4.10 - Figure 4.15.
In each of these ﬁgures, we plot the relative cumulative log-
predictive likelihoods for the DIHM-VAR(2), IHM-VAR(2) and C-VAR(2)-IHM to the

§4.5
Application
81
VAR(1) benchmark on the left panel. Furthermore, to investigate whether allowing
for time-variation in the conditional mean coefﬁcients helps improving forecast ac-
curacy, we also plot the relative cumulative likelihoods for the DIHM-VAR(2) to the
C-VAR(2)-IHM on the right panel of each ﬁgure. Similar plots for the AR models are
shown in Figure 4.13 - Figure 4.12.
Overall, models incorporating any inﬁnite hidden Markov components consistently
dominate the benchmarks over the whole evaluation period in forecasting all vari-
ables. Except for forecasting GDP growh, the DIHM-VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) only
outperform the benchmark after the early 1990s. In addition, a few broad conclusions
can be drawn from the results. First, models restricting the breaks of the VAR coef-
ﬁcients and volatilities to occur at the same time, i.e. IHM-VAR(2) and IHM-AR(2),
forecast poorer than the other variants of IHM models for most periods (except for
forecasting GDP growth — the DIHM-VAR(2) and C-VAR(2)-IHM only outperform
the IHM-VAR(2) after the early 1990s). Second, models allowing for time-variation
in the VAR coefﬁcients tend to improve rather than harm forecast accuracy. This can
be seen from the right panel of Figure 4.10 - Figure 4.15. For example, the DIHM-
VAR(2) and IHM-VAR(2) produce very similar one-quarter-ahead cumulative sums
of log-predictive likelihoods for forecasting GDP inﬂation and GDP growth, however
in the case of forecasting short-term interest rate, the DIHM-VAR(2) substantially
outperforms the IHM-VAR(2), especially in the late 2000s.
It is important to highlight that a model including an inﬁnite hidden Markov com-
ponent does not guarantee a change in the model parameters. Instead, it only allows
for potential changes to occur. This is very different from the TVP-SV models in
which the parameters are always varying over time. One can think of the IHM mod-
els as an intermediate case of the constant parameters models and TVP-SV models.
They ameliorate the potential over-parameterization concern of the TVP-SV models,
while allowing for a more ﬂexible framework than the constant parameters mod-
els in capturing parameters instabilities. Our forecasting results provide empirical
support for this view. It is evident that the inﬁnite hidden Markov component can
act as a safeguard for structural breaks which is likely to improve rather than harm
forecast accuracy. Moreover, models using a single inﬁnite hidden Markov process
to drive the changes of all parameters forecast poorer than the alternative versions
in which two independent inﬁnite hidden Markov processes separately govern the
VAR coefﬁcients and volatilities.

Conclusion
This chapter compares the forecast performance of various speciﬁcations of inﬁnite
hidden Markov switching models. We ﬁrst extend this model into the multivariate
framework, and then propose an algorithm to improve the computational efﬁciency.
The results of our recursive out-of-sample forecast exercise show that allowing for
time-variation in model parameters is important in improving forecast accuracy, es-
pecially in density forecast. We ﬁnd that none of the alternative speciﬁcations of
inﬁnite hidden Markov switching models consistently outperforms the model with
two independent inﬁnite hidden Markov process: one governs the changes of the
conditional mean coefﬁcients and one governs the changes of the volatilities. Models
assuming a single inﬁnite hidden Markov process which drives all model parame-
ters forecasts poorer than the other speciﬁcations of inﬁnite hidden Markov switching
models. Furthermore, models incorporating an inﬁnite hidden Markov component
are tending to improve rather than harm the forecast accuracy.
Appendix
In this Appendix we provide the details of the posterior sampler stated in section 4.4
for model DIHM-VAR(q). Posterior draws can be obtained by sequentially sampling
from Step 1. - Step 7. The sampling method is mainly based on Song [2014]. We
ﬁrst introduce some notation, let ps
i
′ = (ps
i1, . . . , ps
i¯L, psR
i¯L ) and πs = (πs

¯L, πsR

Repeat 3.1 - 3.4 until (4.44) is not hold. Updating of πz and Pz are similar as those of
πs and Ps.

§4.6
Conclusion
87
For Step 4. - Step 7, we only provide sampling procedure for s, πs, Ps, Hs and only
minor modiﬁcation is required for sampling z, πz, Pz, Hz.
Step 4. Sample s
Given us, there are only ﬁnitely many trajectories s with non-zeros probability, i.e.
st ∈{1, . . . , ¯L}. Hence Chib [1996] algorithm can be applied to obtain as follow
1) we ﬁrst compute the conditional density of s1 given us
1 which is given by
p(s1|us
1, Θ, Ps) = p(s1|us
1) ∝1(us
1 < πs
s1) for st = 1, . . . , ¯L;
2) given p(st−1|y1:t−1, us
1:t−1, Θ, Ps), we compute p(st|y1:t, us
1:t, Ps, Θ) by
p(st|y1:t, us
1:t, Ps, Θ)
∝p(st, us
t, y1:t|y1:t−1, us
1:t−1, Θ, Ps)
= ∑
st−1
p(yt, |st, Θ)p(us
t|st, st−1, Ps)p(st|st−1, Ps)p(st−1|y1:t−1, us
1:t−1, Θ, Ps)
=p(yt|st, Θ) ∑
st−1
1(us
t < ps
st−1st)p(st−1|y1:t−1, us
1:t−1, Θ, Ps)
until we get p(sT|y1:T, us
1:T, Θ, Ps).
3) The backward sampling step can be implemented by ﬁrst sample sT from
p(sT|y1:T, us
1:T, Θ, Ps), then given st+1, sample st can be obtained from
p(st|st+1, us, Θ, Ps, y1:T) ∝p(st|y1:t, us, Θ, Ps)p(st+1|st, ut+1)
= p(st|y1:t, us, Θ, Ps)1(us
t+1 < ps
stst+1).
After sampling s we ﬁnd the number of active regime Ls and relabel s, Ps and Θ
accordingly. Reconstruct Ps, πs by collapsing the non-active regimes and set ¯L = Ls.
Step 5. - Step 6. Sample (πs, Ps)
To obtain sample πs and Ps we use the algorithm proposed by Song [2014]. Three
auxiliary variables (It, I′
t, I′′
t ) are introduced to facilitate sampling. The output (It, I′
t, I′′
t )
are also used to sample Hs.
1. initialize m = (m1, . . . , mLs) where mj = 1 if st = j and 0 otherwise. let n be
Ls × Ls zeros matrix .

Chapter 5
Conclusion
This thesis explores the performance of various types of Bayesian mixture models in
macroeconomic analysis. Many studies have already highlighted the empirical im-
portance of allowing for time-variation in model parameters. The main focus of this
thesis is reﬁning our understanding in modeling time-varying parameter processes
to improve model performance in different empirical applications.
In Chapter 2, we investigate the G7 inﬂation forecast performance of autoregres-
sive models with different error distributional assumptions. Our results show that
both the heavy-tailed distributed errors and the stochastic volatility component are
more likely to improve rather than harm forecast accuracy. These two components
can help reduce the inﬂuence of outliers and capture the time varying volatility when
these properties are in the data. Naturally, there is little improvement by including
these two components on forecasting data that seemingly exhibit constant volatility
and has few outliers.
Chapter 3 proposes a new mixture innovation model to re-examine the relationship
between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty for the US, Germany, Canada and New
Zealand. A simulation study shows that the proposed model produces more robust
estimates compared with the conventional benchmark. Our empirical results show
substantial time-variation in the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation uncer-
tainty over the last few decades for all countries. We also ﬁnd strong evidence of
the existence of abrupt changes in this relationship. From the results for the inﬂation
targeting countries, there is evidence that the correlation between inﬂation and in-
ﬂation uncertainty has been weakened since the adoption of inﬂation targeting policy.
Chapter 4 compares forecasting performance of univariate and multivariate inﬁnite
hidden Markov switching models. In addition, we develop a new MCMC method
built upon the precision-based algorithm to improve computational efﬁciency. Our

Conclusion
results show that the conditional mean coefﬁcients and volatilities are likely to be
driven by independent inﬁnite hidden Markov processes. Models assuming a single
inﬁnite hidden Markov process that drives all model parameters forecast poorer than
more ﬂexible speciﬁcations of allowing multiple hidden Markov states.
In sum, we conclude that although many recent macroeconomic studies have demon-
strated the empirical success of standard time-varying parameter models, the task of
carefully selecting a proper time-varying process remains an ongoing task in vari-
ous applications. It requires researchers to grasp many recent emerging econometric
techniques, and to have a deep understanding of the context of the empirical appli-
cation.
