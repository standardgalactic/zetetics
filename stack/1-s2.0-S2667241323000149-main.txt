This study presents the method for optimal error tracking in position control for a servo pneu- 
matic actuated robot grasper system using a new adjustable convergence rate prescribed perfor- 
mance control (ACR-PPC). It focuses on improving the feedback controller and the fractional- 
order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller used for the position control of each 
robot’s ﬁnger. Multiple features were considered such as tracking error, rising time, faster tran- 
sient response with ﬁnite-time convergence, oscillation reduction, and pressure stabilization in 
the pneumatic system. Experiments were conducted using a single ﬁnger of a tri-ﬁnger pneu- 
matic gripper (TPG) robot, actuated by a single proportional valve with a double-acting cylinder 
(PPVDC). Two types of input trajectories were tested: step and sine wave inputs, which are com- 
mon and critical for pneumatic systems. The results show that the proposed method eliminates 
oscillation and achieves high tracking performance within the prescribed bounds and minimal 
overshoot as well. The oscillation was suppressed with minimal overshoot and fast response was 
achieved by tuning the formulated adjustable prescribe performance function, thus improving the 
rising time response without signiﬁcant loss of performance. 
1. Introduction 
Pneumatic and hydraulic systems, known as ﬂuid dynamic actuators, are widely used in various industrial ﬁelds around the world 
due to their high power-to-weight ratio and reliability. Pneumatic actuators oﬀer advantages over hydraulic actuators in terms of 
cleanliness, simplicity of design, low cost, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, the compressibility of air results 
in a lower natural frequency in pneumatic systems, making the airﬂows more complicated through valve pipeline and challenging to 
enhance positioning and tracking accuracy. Additionally, the nonlinear and unpredictable behavior of pneumatic systems is caused by 
the presence of frictional forces, making the control of motion in pneumatic servo systems (PSS) a challenging task. To achieve stability

and eﬃciency in the face of these challenges, a strong control strategy for pneumatic systems is crucial. Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been 
put forth to enhance control systems for pneumatic actuators, speciﬁcally to control the position of rod-piston by utilizing numerical 
control theories, intelligent systems, and optimization techniques that are based on computing. Many diﬀerent control strategies have 
been developed to address the issues in PSS, including the combination of classical control systems, as well as integrated approaches 
incorporating modern techniques such as cascading proportional integral derivative (PID) control, adaptive fractional-order control, 
intelligent control, and data-driven control as well through computing method. Despite their potential, these feedback controllers 
alone struggle to perform eﬀectively in nonlinear systems with uncertainties, like PSS. Prescribed performance control (PPC) [ 1 , 2 ] 
architecture has recently gained popularity due to its simplicity, allowing the user to set error boundary parameters to enhance 
feedback control performance. However, conventional PPC has some drawbacks such as the lack of ﬁnite time features and a ﬁxed 
convergence boundary, which limits its practical applications in real-time scenarios. 
Therefore, this study presents a method to optimize the pneumatic position control system using a newly formulated adjustable 
convergence rate prescribed performance control (ACR-PPC). The focus of this study is to address the high nonlinearities inherent 
in the servo pneumatic rod-piston position control of a single proportional valve with a double-acting cylinder (PPVDC), attached to 
each ﬁnger of the tri-ﬁnger pneumatic grippers (TPG) robot. The fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller 
is used as the feedback control platform, which is improved by the proposed ACR-PPC because it is currently used as the core 
closed-loop controller for each ﬁnger proportional motion in the TPG system. Additionally, this study addresses the dynamic stability 
and unmeasurable test rig constraints such as frictional force at the joint, slip at the joint, and the gravity force factor of the PPVDC. 
Experiments were conducted using two types of input trajectories: step and sinusoidal inputs, which are considered common, practical, 
and critical inputs for a PPVDC motion [3] . 
In this paper, Section II covers the discussion on related works regarding control system design and solutions for pneumatic 
systems. Section III provides information on the pneumatic actuated robot system and its operating principles that were used in this 
study. Section IV outlines the methodology of the proposed ACR-PPC design, its formulation, and its integration with the FOPID 
controller as the inner-loop controller. The results of experiments conducted using the TPG robot platform and their analysis are 
presented in Section V, and the paper concludes with Section VI. 
2. Related Works in the Design and Solution of Control Systems for Pneumatic Systems 
A substantial rise in the use of pneumatic actuators in industrial automation has been noted particularly in the applications such 
as machine precision and ﬂexible systems (robot manipulators and intelligent vehicles). This has led to an increased demand for ac- 
curate position tracking performance and consistent positioning between the two endpoints of the pneumatic actuator’s stroke [ 3 , 4 ]. 
Furthermore, computational intelligence integrated with optimization strategy approaches are gaining traction as a solution, partic- 
ularly in improving the performance of control systems. The function approximation-based intelligent design strategy is commonly 
recognized as a prominent way to cope with the unknown nonlinearities and uncertainties. For instance, fuzzy logic control with 
cascade strategy approach was used by [5] , whereby the single-input fuzzy P + ID controller was proposed for the dynamics control 
with hysteresis compensation on the soft-pneumatic actuator. Fuzzy logic was also used by Chojecki and Ambroziak in their works

as self-tuning tools for particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in air handling unit (AHU) equipped with multiple actuators 
[6] . The similar fuzzy logic-based self-tuning approach was also deployed in [ 3 , 7 ] using a hybrid strategy for a PSS in robot system. 
However, an adaptive neural network was used to improve the performance of error tracking control on PSS in [8] . Most of the inte- 
gration approaches perform an impressive tracking performance of more than 70% whenever compared to the conventional control 
method without any intelligent system assistance. However, most of these systems are still in the oﬄine and predetermined practices 
which require further reﬁning in the real-time process to cater the unpredictable conditions. 
In recent years, a lot of research on fractional order (FO) control systems has been conducted. Unlike traditional calculus which uses 
integer orders of derivatives and integrals, fractional order calculus uses real-number orders. Integer-order derivatives and integrals 
are just special cases of their fractional-order equivalents. In [9] , a fractional-order disturbance observer was proposed to estimate 
mismatched disturbances, while a novel fractional-order sliding mode controller based on an observer was proposed to reduce tracking 
inaccuracies and chatter. For instance, in [10] , an adaptive sliding mode control was improved with a fractional-order derivative 
sliding surface and a switching-type reaching law, leading to less chattering and reduced energy consumption for targeted PSS. On 
the other hand, discrete-time FO integral sliding mode control approach, proposed by [11] , was developed to stabilize pneumatic 
artiﬁcial muscles with an antagonistic conﬁguration, using a fractional-order exponential reaching law. FO approaches also done 
by [ 5 , 12 ], whereby two solutions were proposed using FO integral sliding surfaces and diﬀerent reaching rules to reduce reaching 
time and improve system performance. Researchers have also integrated FO systems with other control systems such as intelligent 
control systems to increase the dimensionality of the FO system. For example, a two-degree-of-freedom FO fuzzy PID controller was 
proposed to improve PSS accuracy in [13] . The FOPID controller provides a signiﬁcant advantage over a typical PID controller by 
having two additional tunable parameters. However, with more parameters, the tuning process is more diﬃcult, especially if it was 
done manually. 
In 2008, Bechlioulis introduced and published a prescribed performance control (PPC), a new control approach with output 
constraints that guarantees system output convergence and crucial signal responses such as maximum overshoots and steady-state 
error into an inﬁnitely narrow prescribed area. In other words, PPC acts as a conjunction between the controller input and the 
controller itself [2] . PPC has been employed in a wide range of control engineering applications that require output restrictions 
[ 14 , 15 ]. The primary objective of PPC was to keep the transforming error function within a speciﬁed range to attain the satisfaction 
of the prescribed error performance metrics for the tracking error [16] . A new proportional-integral approximation-free control for 
nonlinear robotic systems using PPFs without utilizing any function approximate solution was developed in [17] . This approach 
was further improved with a low-complexity structure and prescribed input constraints in [18] . An adaptive control approach with 
PPF restrictions was established in [19] to stabilize the vertical and pitch displacements in active suspensions despite parametric 
uncertainties. An adaptive control technique was developed in [20] to ensure the convergence of tracking error and limit maximum 
overshoot in the suspension system with PPF restrictions and in case of actuator malfunction. However, these results rely on the 
assumption that all system parameters are observable or can be immediately quantiﬁed, which is unlikely to happen in practical 
implementations [14] , and external disturbances can negatively impact control eﬀectiveness [21] . For time-delay systems with PPF 
limitations, an output-feedback control approach was proposed in [22] , while a dynamic surface control technique in response to the 
increasing complexity of problems was introduced in [23] . 
According to the non-restricted characteristic in the PPC method, numerous feedback control techniques can be utilized with this 
conjunction control system to enhance and optimize its feasibility especially with the nonlinear plant. Furthermore, the PPF allows 
users to pre-deﬁne the performance constraint parameters on the control system and obtain the guaranteed performance for limiting 
the tracking error to within a prescribed boundary region. This method has potential to replace or reduce the need of approximation 
control approaches to cater the uncertainties in nonlinear control system structure such as position control on PSS. 
3. Pneumatic Actuated Robot System and Its Principle of Operation 
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the working principle of the tri-ﬁnger pneumatic gripper (TPG) system. The 
TPG platform consists of three independently actuated pneumatic actuators as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The robot grasper operates in two 
primary states: (1) the gripping state (GS) and (2) the release state (RS). The GS state can be proportioned up to the maximum point 
as shown in Fig. 1 (a), and vice versa for the RS state as shown in Fig. 1 (b). 
Each rod-piston pneumatic cylinder has a length of 75 mm, with a particular emphasis on the positioning of one rod-piston for 
one ﬁnger. The main components of the platform are displayed in Table 1 . The control system design for this platform uses a multiple 
input and single output (MISO) conﬁguration and is implemented using a 32-bit microcontroller unit (MCU) running a real-time

minimum two feedback signals, from the rotary encoder on the ﬁnger joint and the pressures from each pneumatic piston cylinder 
to perform closed-loop control. The hardware schematic of the TPG robot control for a single ﬁnger connection is shown in Fig. 2 . 
4. Controller Design 
4.1. Adjustable Converge Rate Prescribed Performance Control 
A limitation has been identiﬁed in the ﬁnite-time prescribed performance function proposed and deployed in [24–26] , where 
the convergence rate is ﬁxed. The concept of an adjustable convergence rate presents a more promising solution to overcome the 
limitations of a ﬁxed rate, as introduced in [2] . This allows for the ability to vary and adjust or tune either the ﬁnite time of convergence 
rate or the diﬀerent transient rate settings. Therefore, the new adjustable convergence rate PPF (AC-PPF) formulation is introduced 
as Eq. (1) as follows: 
𝜌( 𝑡 ) = (𝜌0 − 𝜌∞
)𝜗 𝑎 + 𝜌∞
(1)

where the speciﬁed performance function or smooth function 𝜌( 𝑡 ) is decreased strictly and lim 
𝑡 →∞𝜌( 𝑡 ) = 𝜌∞. 𝜌𝑜 represents the initial 
value of the tracking error 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) at the transient interval. On the other hand, 𝜌∞denotes the maximum permissible range of the 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) at 
the steady-state interval, in which 𝜌( 𝑡 ) , 𝜌0 > 𝜌∞> 0 . The parameter ℎ > 0 represents the convergence rate speed of the. Therefore, as 
shown in illustration from the simulations in Fig. 3 and 4 , ̄𝜎, 𝜎, ℎ, 𝜌0 , and 𝜌∞can be tuned to improve both transient and steady-state 
performances [26] . The decay smooth function, 𝜗 𝑎 , is modify as Eq. (2) as follows: 
𝜗 𝑎 = 𝑒 
− 𝜓 ( 𝑡 ) 2 
𝑡 0 2 
(2) 
where, 
𝜓 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝛽1 𝑡 (tanh [𝛽2 
(𝑡 − 𝑡 0 
)] + 1 )
(3) 
where 𝑡 0 is the predeﬁned convergence time, 𝛽1 is the scaling factor for ﬁnite time with the default value of 1, and 𝛽2 is the scaling 
factor of converging rate with the default value of 1. The ﬁrst advantage of AC-PPF is its ability to adjust the ﬁnite-time convergence 
rate, as demonstrated through simulation as shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that 𝑡 0 can be altered through manipulation of 𝑡 0 = 2 , 
𝑡 0 = 4 , and 𝑡 0 = 6 . Furthermore, the second feature of AC-PPF is the capability to modify the transient period of the convergence rate 
by selecting the value 𝛽2 as depicted in simulation of the function as shown in Fig. 4 with 𝛽1 = 1 by default. The convergence rates 
are diﬀerent for diﬀerent value of 𝛽2 , whereby the convergence curve earlier by the decreasing of 𝛽2 value. 
Remark 1: 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) and ̄𝜎, 𝜎are both positive ﬁnite values. Additionally, both ̄𝜎𝜌(0) and 𝜎𝜌(0) symbolize the upper limit of the maximum 
overshoot and the lower limit of the undershoot, respectively.

4.2. Error Transformation 
For the control scheme with a PPF constraint, the prescribed performance boundary is transformed into an equality form through 
an output transformation. To achieve this, a smooth and strictly increasing function 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] is introduced, as expressed in Eq. (4) as 
follows: 
𝑆 [ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] = 
̄𝜎𝑒 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝜎𝑒 − 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) 
𝑒 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑒 − 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) . 
(4) 
Remark 2: 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] satisﬁes 
1 − 𝜎< 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] < ̄𝜎
2 
lim 
𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) →+∞𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] = ̄𝜎, 
lim 
𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) →−∞𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] = − 𝜎
To establish the relationship between 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝜌( 𝑡 ) , the initially deﬁned constraint tracking error is transformed into an uncon- 
strained form through error transformation methods, allowing the performance condition to be represented as in Eq.(5) as follows: 
𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜌( 𝑡 ) 𝑆 [ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] . 
(5) 
The parameter of 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) is developed to the increased function, 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] and 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) < 𝜌( 𝑡 ) , ∀𝑡 ≥ 0 is obtained because the function of 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] 
is strictly monotonic increasing. The behavior of bounds on both steady-state and transient responses can be ensured by deﬁning 𝜌( 𝑡 ) 
properly. The function that deﬁnes the inverse transformation for the bounded 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) and represents a newly transformed adjustable 
tracking error can be expressed as Eq. (6) as follows: 
𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑆 −1 
( 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) 
𝜌( 𝑡 ) 
) 
= 1 
2 ln 
( 𝜓 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝜎
̄𝜎− 𝜓 ( 𝑡 ) 
) 
(6) 
where 𝑆 −1 (∙) is the inverse function of 𝑆( 𝜀 ) . Meanwhile, 𝜓( 𝑡 ) = 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) ∕ 𝜌( 𝑡 ) is a normalized error and |𝜀 (0) | < 1 . According to [26] , if 
𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ≠0 , 𝜓( 𝑡 ) satisﬁes the condition −1 < 𝜓( 𝑡 ) < 1 . Furthermore, the predeﬁned bound of PPF is guaranteed whenever 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) is constantly 
bounded. The time derivative of 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) and the following function can be obtained as follows: 
̇𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) = 1 
2 
[

𝜓 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝜎−

𝑟 𝑖 = 1 
2 𝜌
[

(8) 
Remark 3: The system’s state is transformed through the smooth function 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] outlined in Eq. (4) and ensuring the regulation 
of the input reference from the stability of 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) in accordance with the performance constraint described in Eq. (1) . 
Remark 4: PPF constraint Eq. (1) and error transform 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] are proposed for the control design process by choosing the control 
parameters ̄𝜎, 𝜎, 𝑡 0 , 𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜌0 , and 𝜌∞. Since the parameters ̄𝜎, 𝜎, 𝜌0 , and 𝜌∞are selected so that the initial condition − 𝜎𝜌(0) < 𝑒 (0) < 
̄𝜎𝜌(0) is satisﬁed and 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) can be restricted within the boundaries, the condition − 𝜎< 𝑆[ 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ] < ̄𝜎is held. Therefore, the control problem 
under the condition − 𝜎𝜌( 𝑡 ) < 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) < ̄𝜎𝜌( 𝑡 ) is guaranteed. 
4.3. Integration of ACR-PPC to the FOPID Controller 
As mentioned earlier, 𝑃 𝐼 𝜆𝐷 𝜇or FOPID controller [27] is used as a nominal feedback control or inner controller platform to verify 
the proposed ACR-PPC system. The general equation for a FOPID controller is expressed as Eq. (9) as follows: 
𝑢 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐾 𝑝 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐾 𝑖 𝑡 0 𝐼 𝑡 
− 𝜆𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐾 𝑑 𝑡 0 𝐷 𝑡 
𝜇̇𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) 
(9) 
where 𝐾 𝑝 , 𝐾 𝑖 , and 𝐾 𝑑 are the proportional, fractional integral, diﬀerential gains coeﬃcient, respectively. The tracking error of 
the system is deﬁned by 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑥 𝑟𝑝 ( 𝑡 ) , where 𝑥 𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑥 𝑟𝑝 ( 𝑡 ) are both trajectory input reference and feedback response for the 
rod piston of PPVDC, respectively. Additionally, two constant parameters, 𝜆and 𝜇, represent the integral and diﬀerential orders, 
respectively, which are the extra tuning parameters from the FOPID controller. Table 2 displays a typical FOPID controller, which 
greatly expands the versatility of PID control design. The general formula for the FOPID controller to track the position error of the 
PPVDC can be derived as Eq. (10) as follows: 
𝑢 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐼 𝜆( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐷 𝜇( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) 
(10) 
with 
𝑃 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐾 𝑝 𝑒 ( 𝑡 ) 
(11) 
and 
𝐼 𝜆( 𝑡 ) = 𝐾 𝑖 𝑅 𝑖 ( 𝑡 )

For the integration with ACR-PPC, Eq. (10) can be rephrased by substituting Eq. (6) into the equation, thus, the new control input 
design with error transformation can be expressed as Eq. (18) as follows: 
𝑢 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐼 𝜆( 𝑡 ) 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐷 𝜇( 𝑡 ) 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) 
(18) 
The complete design of the ACR-PPC with the FOPID controller is depicted in Fig. 5 . It encompasses the ACR-PPC and FOPID 
control structures, as well as a single pneumatic actuation component in the form of the TPG platform serving as the plant. 
5. Results and Discussions 
The proposed control technique was evaluated through experimental studies using the TPG robot platform. The test setup is shown 
in Fig. 6 . The experiments were conducted with two crucial types of input trajectories for a single PPVDC unit that drives a TPG ﬁnger: 
(1) step input and (2) sinusoidal input. The step input was designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller with a 
focus on fast response, while the sinusoidal input was used to evaluate the control strategy’s ability to reduce the constant time lag 
or phase delay between the desired input and feedback response. Both inputs performed GS and RS operations on the targeted TPG 
ﬁnger with diﬀerent speeds and motion periods.

5.1. Step Input Trajectory Test 
For this test, a step input trajectory was implemented within a range of 0to 30 mm for the pneumatic cylinder. Table 3 shows the 
ﬁnetuned controller parameters for both FOPID and PPCs for the step input trajectory. To test the ACR-PPC’s ability to converge at 
a user-deﬁned ﬁnite time, two conditions of trajectory initial input steps were run. These conditions involved a step input starting at 
either 0 or 4 s, with a desired piston position of 30 mm. These two input trajectory conditions were conducted to verify the potential 
of ACR-PPC compared to C-PPC, which is unable to achieve ﬁnite-time convergence. 
Fig. 7 shows that the ACRPPC-FOPID controller exhibits superior stability, precision, and absence of overshoot compared to the 
FOPID and CPPC-FOPID controllers in the step input positioning. The ACRPPC-FOPID controller has a 25% faster rise time compared 
to the CPPC-FOPID controller, resulting in improved stability of the positioning control. The FOPID controller has a slightly quicker 
transient response, it was unable to eﬀectively address the overshoot problem, as demonstrated at around 0.2 s as shown in Fig. 7 (a). 
The ACRPPC-FOPID controller has a 7% and 5% faster settling time compared to the FOPID and CPPC-FOPID controllers, respectively. 
This trend can also be seen in the initial operation starting at 4 ss as shown in Fig. 7 (b). In this scenario, the ACRPPC-FOPID controller 
exhibits signiﬁcantly more stability and control compared to the CPPC-FOPID and FOPID controllers in terms of steady state error. 
Meanwhile, the CPPC-FOPID controller exhibits a large steady state error after about 1.8 s of hold, with an error range of 2.5 to 5 
mm, compared to the ACRPPC-FOPID and FOPID controllers. 
From the perspective of prescribed performance, the tracking error of the rod-piston system using CPPC-FOPID and VPP-FOPID 
controllers is shown in Fig. 8 . The tracking error from the FOPID controller was also included for comparison. As seen in Fig. 8 , despite 
operating within the prescribed bounds, the FOPID controller still experienced oscillations early on compared to the CPPC-FOPID 
and ACRPPC-FOPID controllers. Fig. 8 (a) demonstrates the advantages of the ﬁnite-time and convergence rate variables oﬀered by

the proposed ACRPPC-FOPID in tracking the error of the PPVDC rod-piston. ACRPPC-FOPID reduces the convergence rate period by 
0.2s compared to CPPC-FOPID, which results in a 50% reduction in the transient time of the rod-piston with no overshoot, as shown 
in Fig. 7 . In the case of a delayed ignition, only the convergence rate needs to be adjusted to stabilize and improve the rod-piston 
positioning using ACRPPC-FOPID as seen in Fig. 8 (b). 
Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that there is a certain impact on the pressure performance in the cylinder, as demonstrated in Fig. 9 . In 
Fig. 9 (a), the pressure in the cylinder for ACRPPC-FOPID displays a smooth pressure curve compared to CPPC-FOPID and FOPID. At 
the initial 0.25 s, ACRPPC-FOPID exhibits very minimal oscillations in pressure, whereas CPPC-FOPID and FOPID show an overshoot 
of 0 to − 1 MPa and ﬂuctuations in pressure. A similar scenario was observed in the delayed ignition operation, as shown in Fig. 9 (b). 
FOPID shows a high overshoot at around 4 s when the positioning starts, which can be linked to the positioning performance depicted 
in Figs. 7 (b) and 8 (b), as discussed previously. The results were further substantiated by the tracking performance evaluation using 
integral absolute error (IAE), integral square error (ISE), and integral time absolute error (ITAE) for a step input trajectory, as shown 
in Fig. 10 . The results indicate that the ACRPPC-FOPID controller exhibits the lowest values of IAE, ISE, and ITAE compared to 
the FOPID and CPPC-FOPID controllers. ACRPPC-FOPID can achieve about 30% and 2% lower ITAE compared to FOPID and CPPC- 
FOPID, respectively. Almost similar pattern was recorded for IAE and ISE, whereby ACRPPC-FOPID is slightly lower than CPPC-FOPID 
and far better than FOPID. These ﬁndings suggest that the proposed ACRPPC-FOPID controller consistently provides high tracking 
performances for nonlinear systems such as PPVDC rod-piston.

5.2. Sine Wave Trajectory Test 
The validation and analysis were conducted by comparing the FOPID, CPPC-FOPID, and ACRPPC-FOPID controllers with a 0.25- 
Hz sine wave trajectory, as depicted in Fig. 11 . The sine wave trajectory with a frequency of 0.25 Hz was selected because it was the 
optimal value for experimentation on the targeted test rig. Table 4 displays the controller parameters used for the sine wave input 
trajectory and its ﬁnal tuning values. Similar to the step input trajectory test, this experiment was also performed with a 4-s delay 
ignition.

Figure 11. Displacement performance of the rod-piston started at (a) 0 s and (b) 4 s 
The ACRPPC-FOPID controller demonstrates smooth operation in its initial stage, when it was deployed with a sine wave trajectory, 
as shown in Fig. 11 . On the other hand, the FOPID controller encountered signiﬁcant oscillation at the start, as illustrated in Fig. 11 (a), 
and experienced a sharp overshoot that peaked at approximately 4 to 4.2 s, as demonstrated in Fig. 11 (b). The performance of the 
tracking error was inﬂuenced by the adjustment of the decay function, as displayed in Fig. 12 . After a few cycles of the sine wave 
trajectory, the tracking error for both the CPPC-FOPID and ACRPPC-FOPID controllers became nearly identical, but they diﬀered in 
their convergence period. Fig. 12 (a) shows that the CPPC-FOPID was delayed by approximately 0.43 s in reaching zero compared to 
the ACRPPC-FOPID. The AC-PPF’s ﬁnite-time and convergence rate adjustments resulted in disparities between the ACRPPC-FOPID 
and CPPC-FOPID, not just in terms of the tracking error but also in the time lag. This diﬀerence is evident from the delayed ignition 
test, as shown in Fig. 11 (b) and Fig. 12 (b), where the CPPC-FOPID settling time lagged the ACRPPC-FOPID by about 4 s. Meanwhile, 
the FOPID controller still suﬀered from oscillation and overshoot, which had an impact on pressure performance, as illustrated in 
Fig. 13 . 
Both ACRPPC-FOPID and CPPC-FOPID controllers show minor ﬂuctuations in their pressure behavior during the ﬁrst rising period, 
compared to the FOPID controller. The displacement performance, as seen in Fig. 11 (a), indicates that during the initial rising phase 
from 0 to 1 s, the ACRPPC-FOPID maintained nearly constant pressure diﬀerences compared to the CPPC-FOPID and FOPID. However,

Figure 12. Tracking error performance with prescribed performance bound of the rod-piston started at (a) 0 s and (b) 4 s 
a signiﬁcant negative overshoot was observed at around 0.2 s, as depicted in Fig. 13 (a). During the delay ignition test, as shown in 
Fig. 13 (b), the pressure distribution for the CPPC-FOPID was not as smooth as the ACRPPC-FOPID but was much more stable than 
that of the FOPID. This is due to the impact of gravity force and the friction force between the TPG platform’s joint region when the 
rod-piston expands, pushing the TPG ﬁnger downward, and retracts, pulling it upward, during sequential GS and RS operations. This 
outcome suggests that the ACRPPC-FOPID outperforms both the FOPID and CPPC-FOPID in terms of pressure distribution. 
6. Conclusion 
The proposed ACR-PPC with FOPID controller strategies were introduced and veriﬁed through multiple experiments on the TPG 
platform, ensuring the system’s transient and steady-state error performance. One noteworthy conclusion from this study is that 
the ACR-PPC eﬀectively eliminates the initial oscillation that leads to mechanical vibration following each rod-piston positioning 
transient and addresses the phase-shifted issue in the FOPID controller. The improved performance in various input conditions, such 
as sinusoidal input trajectories, demonstrates that the proposed control strategy can handle the constant time lag or phase shift

Figure 13. The pressure diﬀerence in between both cylinder chambers performance started at (a) 0 s and (b) 4 s 
between the desired input and feedback response. Additionally, the absence of approximation in the proposed ACR-PPC reduces the 
complexity of controller design in terms of methodology. Since pneumatic systems are also known for their highly nonlinear behavior, 
future research should consider the nonlinear characteristics, such as valve dead-zone, and external disturbances, such as gravity, 
especially in dynamic and uncertain input conditions.
