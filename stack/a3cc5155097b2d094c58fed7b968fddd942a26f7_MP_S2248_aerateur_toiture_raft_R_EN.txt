With Insulation Stop 
for Loose Fill Applications
ATTIC RAFTER VENTS
• Year-round performance – in summer, aids in 
reducing heat build-up and cooling requirements; 
in winter, prevents roof damage by reducing 
moisture build-up
• Durable, break-resistant, yet lightweight for easy 
installation; will not rot or deteriorate
• Perforated design snaps in half for use in both 
new (24") and retrofit (16") construction
Unique design assures unrestricted 
air flow from soffit to attic

Remove all loose debris from above soffit vent. 
Place ready-to-use raft-R-mate® vent between roof 
rafters (as illustrated above) in such a manner 
as to prevent batt or loose-fill insulation from 
obstructing the soffit vent. To ensure 
long-term placement of raft-R-mate® 
vent, staple flange and center 
valley (if applicable) every 10" 
to underside of roof deck with 
coated roof staples (3/8" max.).

raft-R-mate® is a rigid foam extruded polystyrene rafter vent 
that assures the unrestricted flow of fresh air from the soffit 
to the attic through the thickest part of the fibrous or loose-fill 
insulation.
It offers year-round performance by aiding cross-ventilation 
in summer for increased comfort and reduced cooling require-
ments, and by helping to prevent ice dams in winter.
raft-R-mate® Attic Rafter Vent’s high resistance to moisture means 
it will not rot or decay over time. Years later, the product will 
perform as effectively as it did the day it was installed. Its built-
in rigidity makes it extremely break-resistant and easy to install.  
raft-R-mate® Attic Rafter Vent is designed for use as an integral 
component of a building’s insulation/ventilation system.
