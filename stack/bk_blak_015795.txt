tainment value. But imagine the biological, medical, and legal consequences of 
such an incident. It’s not difficult to understand why, in today’s society, it is increas-
ingly rare for factories to offer guided tours of their facilities.
When the construction is completed, there is much pomp and circumstance, 
including a parade, the waving of French flags, and the playing of La Marseillaise. 
The capsule is loaded into the breach of the giant gun (Fig. 1.1), the fuse is lit, and 
instantly a puff of smoke appears out of the muzzle. The Moon comes into view, and 
soon the details of the face of the man in the Moon (the face of Méliès) become 
clear. The landing is shown, at first comically, as the capsule pierces the eye of the 
moon, and then somewhat more seriously, as the capsule glides gently onto the sur-
face of the Moon.
The astronomers exit the space capsule to find a breathable atmosphere, gravity 
comparable to that on Earth, and snowfall. Numerous celestial oddities appear, 
including the rising of the Earth over the lunar horizon. As they explore a subterra-
nean cavern, the astronomers find giant mushrooms and discover that an umbrella 
planted in the ground will take root and transform into a giant mushroom. The 
astronomers encounter an aggressive (or possibly just curious and hyperenthusias-
tic) race of beings, called the Selenites, or inhabitants of the Moon (a concept and 
terminology borrowed from Wells). They defend themselves against the Selenites 
(or is it an unwarranted imperialist attack on the indigenous population?) by striking 
them with their umbrellas. In so doing they discover that these are exceedingly 
fragile beings, which instantly disintegrate into a puff of smoke. The astronomers 
are eventually outnumbered, captured, and brought before the Selenite king. They 
manage to escape, vaporizing more Selenites in the process, and return to their 
space capsule, only to realize that they have no means of propulsion to get back to 
Earth. No worries. One of the astronomers (the president, himself?) tugs on a rope 
attached to the nose of the capsule, pulling it off the edge of the Moon, and it simply 
falls back to Earth. They splash down in the ocean and are recovered by a steamship, 
which tows them back to safety.

ity before leaving the muzzle of the gun. Will the travelers survive the launch?

1.2  Exploring the Science in Le Voyage dans la Lune
As we explore the science in this movie, we should keep in mind that Méliès was 
not primarily concerned with getting the science right. Rather, as a professional 
magician, he was more interested in exploring the kinds of illusions he could create 
with this new medium of motion pictures. Thus, Méliès was a pioneer of motion 
picture special effects. Nevertheless, it is fair game for us to critique the science 
content of the movie, and to discover how much of it, if any, is plausible.
Let’s begin with the launch mechanism for the space capsule. Unlike actual 
spacecraft, which have been built on Earth since the mid-twentieth century, the 
space capsule in the movie carries no fuel and is not self-propelled. It is fired from 
a giant gun. Is this a plausible mechanism for achieving human spaceflight? Simply 
put, could the passengers in the space capsule survive a launch of this sort? Extensive 
research has been done on the biological effects of large accelerations—what hap-
pens to the human body when you experience a large increase in speed over a short 
period of time (as in a rocket launch), or when you are traveling at high speed and 
suddenly change direction (as in a fighter jet). Throughout this book, you will be 
invited to come up with estimates of various things, based on information presented 
in a movie or TV episode scene. But the information that you are able to gather by 
watching the scene may not be enough. You may need to make some additional 
assumptions, in order to calculate the result. The launch mechanism in Le Voyage 
dans La Lune provides a good illustration of the kind of information you can gather 
by watching the movie scene and the kind of additional assumptions you will need 
to make, in order to do a calculation. In particular, is there enough information in the 
movie to make an estimate of how much acceleration the passengers in the space 
capsule will experience during the launch? If not, what additional assumptions do 
we need to make, in order to do the calculation? Finally, we can compare the result 
of our estimate to known limits on the amount of acceleration that the human body 
can tolerate and decide whether or not the giant gun approach to spaceflight is 
plausible.
1.2.1  Motion with Uniform Acceleration
When an object experiences uniform (constant) acceleration, a, the position of the 
object, x, and the velocity of the object, v, at any time t, are described by the follow-
ing equations:

The constant xo is the initial position, at time t = 0, and vo is the initial velocity. We 
are free to choose the starting time, t = 0, to be any time that is convenient. The 
simplest choice is to define t = 0 to be the time at which the space capsule is at rest 
in the breach of the giant gun. This means that the initial velocity, vo is zero. We are 
also free to choose our coordinates to make the initial position convenient. The 
simplest choice is xo = 0. With these choices, the two equations (1.1a) and (1.2a) are 
simplified considerably, giving us:

(1.2b)
We want to come up with an estimate of the acceleration, a, of the space capsule. 
How much information do we know, and what additional information do we need in 
order to answer the question, Will the astronomers survive the launch?
We will consider two fairly straight-forward ways of estimating the acceleration 
of the space capsule, both of which involve using information presented in the 
movie, plus an additional set of reasonable assumptions, which are not explicitly 
presented in the movie. The first important observation to make is that the space 
capsule in Le Voyage dans la Lune has no internal propulsion system. It’s just a giant 
artillery shell fired from a giant gun. So one reasonable assumption to make is that 
in order to leave Earth and travel to the Moon, the space capsule must achieve 
escape velocity: the minimum velocity needed to go into a stable orbit around the 
Earth. It’s also important to realize that the space capsule must achieve escape 
velocity before it leaves the muzzle of the gun. Once the capsule leaves the gun, the 
expanding gas from the explosion of the gunpowder is no longer of any use to 
increase the speed of the capsule. In actuality, a little more than escape velocity is 
needed, if the capsule is to overcome the effects of air resistance. Once the capsule 
leaves the muzzle of the gun, not only is there no more propelling force from the 
expanding gas of the explosion, but also is there a resistive force that will slow it 
down as it travels through the Earth’s atmosphere. But since all we want is an esti-
mate of the acceleration, we can ignore air resistance. Escape velocity will be good 
enough for our purpose.
Example 1.1: Estimating the  Acceleration of  the  Space Capsule (Simple 
Approach)
The simplest approach to estimating the acceleration of the space capsule in Le 
Voyage dans la Lune is to take a guess for the time, t, that the capsule spends inside 
the gun. Based on what we see in the movie, it takes about 1 s from the moment the 
gun is fired until the capsule leaves the gun. We know that the final velocity of the 
capsule must be equal to escape velocity (approximately 11.2 km/s). So we can 
solve Eq. (1.2b) for the acceleration, a, and substitute our values for the time, t, and 
velocity, v.

Example 1.2: Acceleration of  the  Space Capsule Using Data from  Jules 
Verne’s Novel
An alternative approach to estimating the acceleration involves making another rea-
sonable assumption, which is not explicitly presented in the movie. Recall that the 
movie is based, in part, on a novel by Jules Verne, in which the length of the giant 
gun is said to be 900 ft. Instead of taking a guess for the time, t, at which the capsule 
leaves the muzzle of the gun after it is fired, we could use the known final velocity 
(escape velocity) and the distance traveled to reach escape velocity (the length of 
the gun). We can combine the two equations (1.1b) and (1.2b) to eliminate the time, 
t. If we solve Eq. (1.2b) for t, and substitute into Eq. (1.1b), we get

(1.4)
We can now calculate the acceleration using escape velocity for v and the length of 
the gun for x. But in order to do the calculation, we need to put all quantities in a 
consistent set of units (e.g., velocity in m/s, and distance in m). We convert the 
length of the gun from feet to meters using the approximate conversion factor of 
0.305 m/ft: (900 ft)(0.305 m/ft) = 274.5 m. Finally, using Eq. (1.4), we calculate the 
acceleration:

Note that the results of Examples 1.1 and 1.2 do not agree with each other. If you 
are puzzled by this apparent discrepancy, keep in mind that we made different 
assumptions in each case. In the first example, we simply took a guess for the time, 
t, based on what we saw in the movie. In the second example, we used information 
that was not actually presented in the movie, but which came from the novel on 
which the movie was based. The result that you get when you do any calculation 
will depend on the assumptions that you make. When you are asked to do calcula-
tions later in this book, be sure to state your assumptions clearly.
Example 1.3: Comparing Space Gun Acceleration to  the  Acceleration Due 
to Gravity
Having estimated the acceleration experienced by the space travelers in Le Voyage 
dans la Lune by two different methods, we are now in a position to ask whether or 
not they will survive the launch. Let’s first compare the estimated acceleration to the 
average acceleration due to gravity on Earth: g  =  9.8  m/s2. If we divide the

1.5  Roadmap to the Rest of the Book
The material of this book is organized around Seven Major Questions—seven recur-
ring themes in science fiction, which will serve as springboards for exploring sci-
ence concepts and current research. Each chapter includes a set of exploration 
topics, with references for further reading. In Chap. 2, we take up the first of the 
seven major questions: What is the nature of space and time? We will explore the 
physics of space travel and time travel within the framework of classical Newtonian 
physics, as well as Einstein’s special and general theories of relativity. Chapter 3—
What is the universe made of?—is an exploration of matter, energy, and the funda-
mental interactions, or forces of physics. Beginning with the Standard Model of 
particle physics and working up the scale through the atomic nucleus, atoms, gases, 
liquids, and solids, we will examine some interactions of energy and matter. In 
Chap. 4, we take up the question, Can a machine become self-aware? We will 
explore some of the branches of the cognitive sciences, a highly interdisciplinary 
field, which includes specialists in computer science, robotics, artificial intelligence, 
neuroscience, and cognitive psychology, all focused on understanding how humans 
think and learn. Chapter 5 examines the science behind the search for extraterres-
trial intelligence, as we take up the question Are we alone in the universe? In Chap. 
6 we will transgress the boundaries of science and philosophy, as we explore the 
question What does it mean to be human? The focus will be primarily on biological 
sciences and biomedical technology, but a complete answer to the question may 
take us beyond the domain of science. Chapter 7 addresses the question How can we

and again in Chap. 6. Here we will use Data’s creativity and scientific curiosity as a 
lead-in to an exploration of the nature of space and time.
In the opening scene of the episode Descent, Part I, Data creates a holodeck 
simulation (a virtual reality environment, which we will discuss more in Chap. 7) to 
enable him to play poker with three of the most famous people in the history of 
physics: Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727), Albert Einstein (1879–1955), and Stephen 
Hawking (1942–2018) [2]. Data’s primary concern was to learn more about these 
three specific human personalities, and by extension, to understand more about 
what it means to be human. But here we are interested in comparing the three views 
of the nature of space and time represented by these three figures from the history 
of physics, as well as their different ways of understanding the force of gravity [3]. 
A brief summary of the three views is presented in Table 2.1. We will discuss each 
of them in some detail in the sections which follow.
2.2  Classical Physics: Newton’s Laws
The foundation of classical physics was laid with the publication of the Philosophiae 
Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). 
Newton’s first book of the Principia (1687) included statements of his three Axioms

or Laws of Motion, which, according to Motte’s translation [4], may be summarized 
as follows:
	1.	 Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, 
unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.
	2.	 The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made 
in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.
	3.	 To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction, or the mutual actions 
of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.
The second law, as originally stated, included no explicit mention of the mass of 
the body. By change of motion, Newton was referring to the change in momentum, 
which he understood to be the product of the mass times the velocity. If mass is 
constant, then we simply have the change in velocity (or acceleration). The second 
law may then be written in equation form as force equals mass times acceleration:
	
F
ma
=
. 	
(2.1)
It’s important to make a distinction between vector quantities, such as force and 
acceleration, which have both magnitude and direction, and a scalar quantity, such 
as mass, which has only magnitude. Thus it would be possible for multiple forces to 
act on an object from various directions, in such a way as to make the net force equal 
to zero. An object’s state of rest or motion will change, according to Newton’s first 
law, only if there is a net (nonzero) force acting on it. Similarly, the acceleration of

within the framework of Newton’s First Law of Motion. In each case, identify the 
system (object at rest or in motion) and the source of the external force acting on the 
system to change its state of rest or motion.
2.2.2  Illustration of Newton’s Second Law of Motion (F = ma) 
and the Law of Gravity
Next we consider a scene, which does not involve superpowers, but rather a 
mountain-­climbing accident, combined with a bit of futuristic technology. Toward 
the beginning of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, James T. Kirk (played by William 
Shatner, who also directed the movie) is free-climbing El Capitan, a popular land-
mark in Yosemite National Park, while on shore leave from his usual post as Captain 
of the U.S.S. Enterprise [6]. He is distracted from his ascent by his First Officer, Mr. 
Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who suddenly comes alongside Kirk, hovering on jet 
boots. Spock fails to understand the logic of mountain climbing, and questions 
whether Kirk appreciates the gravity of his situation. Kirk assures him that gravity 
is foremost on his mind (obvious pun intended). Unfortunately, the philosophical 
discussion comes to an abrupt end, when Kirk slips off the rock face and falls to his 
apparent doom. Spock, with the aid of his jet boots, dives to the rescue. Quickly 
overtaking Kirk, and grabbing him by the ankle, Spock brings him safely to a stop 
at the last possible moment, just inches above the rocks at the base of the mountain.
Kirk falling off the face of the mountain provides a dramatic illustration of 
another of Newton’s famous laws: the Universal Law of Gravitation. The law states 
that the magnitude of the force of gravity acting between two objects depends on the 
product of their masses and inversely on the square of the distance between them, or

(2.2)
The constant, G, in Eq. (2.2) is the universal gravitational constant. When Newton 
published this law in the Principia, along with his three laws of motion, he was 
accused of plagiarism by his contemporary, Robert Hooke (1635–1703). Hooke is 
perhaps better known for his law concerning the force exerted by springs, which we 
will examine in the next chapter, when we explore materials science.
For a small object (such as Kirk) falling over a short distance near the surface of 
the Earth, Eq. (2.2) can be expressed as
	
F
mg

(2.3)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the particular location. Note that Eq. 
(2.3) is just a special case of Newton’s more general Second Law of Motion

(Eq. 2.1), with the acceleration, a, replaced by the local acceleration due to gravity, 
g. The precise value of g depends on both latitude and altitude, with an average 
value of around the globe of approximately 9.8 m/s2.
Example 2.1: Kirk, Spock, and Jet Boots
Using information in the movie scene, plus a few reasonable assumptions, we can 
come up with an estimate of the force which Spock must exert on Kirk’s ankle, to 
stop his fall.
We will ultimately use Eq. (2.1), F = ma, to calculate the force. The first ingredi-
ent we need is an estimate of Kirk’s mass. Let’s take m = 80 kg as a reasonable 
estimate. Next we need to estimate the acceleration, a. Recall from Chap. 1 that 
acceleration is the change in velocity over the change in time, Δv/Δt. The force that 
Spock exerts on Kirk’s leg brings him quickly to a stop. So his final velocity is zero. 
All we need are estimates of Kirk’s initial velocity, at the instant that Spock grabs 
his ankle, and the amount of time, Δt, required to stop him from that instant. The 
time interval is easy to estimate by watching the movie scene, but how do we esti-
mate Kirk’s initial velocity? As an object falls under the influence of gravity, it’s 
speed increases. But as it falls through the air, the force of air resistance opposes the 
force of gravity. Air resistance is a force, which increases with speed. So if an object 
falls long enough, eventually the force of air resistance will equal the force of grav-
ity. If the net force is zero, there is no longer any acceleration, and the object will 
fall at a constant speed, which we call terminal velocity. Let’s make the reasonable 
assumption that Kirk has fallen long enough to reach terminal velocity before Spock 
catches up with him. Terminal velocity actually depends on the shape and size of the 
object and the density of the air, but a reasonable value is about 56 m/s for an adult 
human. If we assume that it takes about 1 s for Spock to stop Kirk completely, we 
are now in a position to calculate the force.

The result is expressed in units of kg m/s2, which is the unit of force named for 
Sir Isaac Newton (N). But most of us are used to thinking about force in units of 
pounds. So if we want to appreciate what effect this force is likely to have on Kirk’s 
leg, let’s convert from Newtons to pounds, using the approximate conversion factor, 
1 N = 0.225 lb. This gives a force of about 1007 lb!

of air to float over the surface of the Earth. If the attack ships are pushing down on 
the surface of the Earth to counter the force of gravity, then anything in between the 
ship and the surface of the Earth will feel the force. The magnitude of this force 
must be equal to the weight of the ship (which we can estimate from data given in 
the movie). The resulting pressure can be calculated by dividing the force by the 
surface area under the ship.
Example 2.2: Giant City-Destroying Spaceships
Let’s use the data presented in the movie Independence Day to estimate the pressure 
underneath the giant city-destroying attack ships. One possible complication is the 
fact that we are given dimensions of both the mother ship (550 km in diameter) and 
the attack ships (15 miles wide), but we are only given the mass of the mother ship 
(1/4 the mass of the Moon). One reasonable assumption we can make is that the attack 
ships are approximately disc-shaped. (Recall that the volume of disc is 4πr2h, where r 
is the radius and h is the height of the disc.) Another reasonable assumption we could 
make is that the density (mass per unit volume) of the mother ship and the attack ships 
might be comparable to each other. Although this is not quite true, let’s further assume 
that the mother ship is roughly spherical in shape. (Recall that the volume of a sphere 
is 4/3πr3.) We can then take the following approach to solve the problem:
Assumption: Density of mother ship  =  density of attack ship  =  mass/
volume = constant.

The movie scene shows the attack ships hovering over the surface of the Earth. 
In other words, no acceleration in the vertical direction. According to Newton’s 
Second Law, if there is no acceleration, there can be no net force. But the force of 
Earth’s gravity is pulling the ship downward, so the ship must somehow be pushing 
against the Earth with an equal and opposite force to keep itself hovering. The force 
required to keep one of these ships aloft (balanced against the force of gravity) is 
F = mg. The resulting pressure under one of these ships is the force divided by the 
area of the disc, or

In the end, the radius of the attack ship cancels out. All we need to do is to take a guess 
as to the height, h, of one of the attack ships. Then it remains simply to put all of the 
quantities given in the movie into the same system of units and look up a value for the 
mass of the moon. The completion of this calculation is left as an exercise.
Estimation 2.2: Pressure Underneath the Independence Day Attack Ships
Complete the calculation, which we set up in Example 2.2. Be sure to convert all 
quantities into a consistent set of units (mass in kg, linear dimensions in m, accel-
eration due to gravity in m/s2). Using data gathered from the movie, together with a 
reasonable set of additional assumptions, the resulting pressure will come out to a 
ridiculously large number. Compare this pressure to the pressure at the bottom of 
the Mariana Trench—the deepest part of the ocean. Do the attack ships really need 
to use a death ray to destroy the major cities of Earth?

Example 2.3: Armored Hovercraft and Landmines in Die Another Day
In stark contrast to the scenario in Independence Day, a considerably more realis-
tic illustration of the pressure underneath a hovering object is found in the 2002 
movie Die Another Day. British secret agent James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), on a 
mission to prevent war with a potentially hostile nation, discovers an illegal arms 
deal financed by African conflict diamonds. A chase ensues involving armored 
hovercraft, which are able to float over a minefield [11]. How realistic is this 
scenario?
According to data posted by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the 
landmine known as the M15 AT is “13–1/8 in. in diameter, 4–7/8 in. high, and 
weighs 30 lb with 22 lb of high explosives.” This type of mine is a “track-breaker” 
(presumably designed to destroy the treads of an armored tank) and is “activated 
by 350 lb of pressure” [12]. It’s important to note that a pound is not a unit of pres-
sure. It is a unit of weight or force. If a force of 350 lb is applied to the pressure 
plate, the mine will explode. Would one of the armored hovercraft in Die Another 
Day be able to float over such an explosive device? To answer this question, we 
will need to estimate three things: first, the surface area of the mine’s pressure 
plate; second, the trigger pressure of the mine; and third, the pressure under the 
armored hovercraft.
Landmine pressure plate area, A: From a photo available on the FAS website, the 
diameter of the pressure plate is approximately 2/3 the overall diameter of the M15 
AT mine, or about 9 in. Thus, the area of the pressure plate is given by

Pressure under the armored hovercraft: In order to determine whether it is plau-
sible for one of the hovercraft to float over the landmine without triggering it, we 
need to make some reasonable assumptions about the hovercraft. An illustration is 
shown in Fig. 2.3. Let’s suppose that the weight of one of these armored vehicles is 
about 5000 lb, which is about the same as the “curb weight” of a typical heavy-duty 
pickup truck. Let’s also assume that the dimensions of the armored vehicle are

Since the trigger pressure of the landmine is many times greater than the esti-
mated pressure under the hovercraft, the scene in Die Another Day is definitely 
realistic. Assuming that the properties of the mines in the movie are comparable to 
the M15 AT track-breakers, the armored hovercraft could easily float over the mines 
without exploding them.
You might be wondering about the apparent inconsistency. Why is it that the 
hovercraft in Die Another Day can safely glide over the minefield, without trigger-
ing the mines, but the attack ship from Independence Day would crush everything 
underneath it. Check all of the assumptions that went into the Independence Day 
calculation carefully and see if you can find the flaw. The answer will be revealed in 
the next chapter.
Estimation 2.3: Newton’s Law of Gravitation Applied to Le Voyage dans la Lune
In the previous chapter, we analyzed the mechanism of human spaceflight imagined 
by Jules Verne and illustrated in the 1902 movie Le Voyage dans la Lune. We con-
cluded that launching a space capsule out of a giant canon would be fatal to the 
astronauts. We also mentioned that the return to Earth by falling off the edge of the

Moon (Fig.  2.4)  was also suspect, given an understanding of Newton’s Law of 
Gravitation. Use Eq. (2.2) to compare the force of the Moon’s gravity acting on the 
space capsule to the force of Earth’s gravity acting on the space capsule. Does this 
explain why the Apollo astronauts needed rocket propulsion in order to leave the 
Moon and return to Earth? 
2.2.5  The Validity of Newton’s Laws of Motion
Even though Newton formulated his laws of motion over three centuries ago, they 
continue to serve us perfectly well for most everyday purposes. Only under a few 
extreme conditions, do they need to be modified or replaced by more sophisticated 
concepts. These include the extremely small, the extremely massive, and the 
extremely fast. Classical physics begins to break down at the nanoscale (dimen-
sions of order 10−9 m). The behavior of subatomic particles cannot be explained 
without the concepts of quantum mechanics, a subject which is beyond the scope 
of this book. But even objects consisting of a few hundred or a few thousand atoms 
behave differently, compared to the same material in bulk quantities. We will touch 
on the physics of nanoparticles briefly in the next chapter. But first we turn our 
attention to the other two regimes in which Newton’s laws need to be refined or 
replaced: at speeds approaching the speed of light and for masses on a planetary 
scale or larger.

2.3  Modern Physics: Einstein and Relativity
Newton’s Laws of Motion and his Universal Law of Gravitation transformed our 
understanding of the way in which the universe works. Without them, spaceflight to 
the Moon and the planets simply would not be possible. Although they apply per-
fectly well in the realm of most of everyday experience and always will, they are not 
the last word. In particular, Newton’s concept of space and time as separate and 
independent quantities is only an approximation to reality. As we will see shortly, an 
important piece of modern technology, which was unimaginable in Newton’s time, 
but has become commonplace in the twenty-first century, simply would not work 
without another refinement to our understanding of space and time. We will also 
discover that this same refinement opens another possibility, which Newton never 
could have anticipated: time travel!
The second of Commander Data’s holodeck-simulated trio of famous physicists 
is Albert Einstein. Einstein’s special theory of relativity, published in 1905, included 
the concepts of time dilation (moving clocks run slow relative to clocks at rest), 
length contraction (to an observer at rest, moving objects appear shorter along the 
direction of relative motion), and the equivalence of matter and energy (the famous 
equation E = mc2). His general theory of relativity, published in 1916, described 
space and time not as separate and independent quantities, but as a single four-­
dimensional quantity, spacetime. In the vicinity of a large mass, this spacetime is 
distorted: space is stretched out and clocks run slower the deeper they are into the 
distortion (closer to the mass). According to Einstein, the phenomenon which we 
experience as gravity is simply a property of this distorted spacetime. But the con-
cept of existence in four dimensions, and the possibility of time travel predates the 
publication of Einstein’s special theory of relativity by 10 years, and shows up in a 
work of science fiction. H.G. Wells published his debut novel, the “Time Machine,” 
in 1895, the first chapter of which includes the following:
“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost 
universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a 
misconception.”
“Is that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person 
with red hair.
“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon 
admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of 
thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. 
These things are mere abstractions.”
“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.
“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.”
“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All real things –”
“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?”

where t is the time as experienced in a frame of reference at rest (on Earth), t′ is the

the speed of light. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 2.5.
Example 2.3: Relativistic Time Dilation in Planet of the Apes
Here we will use the information provided in the opening scene of Planet of the 
Apes to calculate the speed of the spaceship, according to Einstein’s concept of time 
dilation (Eq. 2.4). We will do this in two ways and compare the results. First, let’s 
calculate the average speed of the ship over the entire trip, up to the point of the 
opening monolog. The ship’s chronometer displays three important pieces of infor-
mation: the launch date (01-14-1972), the current time onboard the ship (07-14-1972), 
and the current time on Earth (03-23-2673). In Eq. (2.4), the proper time, t, is the 
elapsed time in the rest frame of reference (on Earth). Subtracting the launch date 
from the current date on Earth gives approximately 702 years (including an extra 
day for every leap year). Meanwhile, in the moving frame of reference, the elapsed 
time, t′, is the difference between the current time onboard the ship and the launch 
date, which is 6 months. We can solve Eq. (2.4) for the average speed of the ship, v, 
first by rearranging:

So the average speed of the ship up to the point of the monolog is just slightly less 
than the speed of light. It is important to emphasize once again that according to 
Einstein, nothing that has mass can actually travel at the speed of light. (Only mass-
less particles, such as photons, can travel at the speed of light.)
The camera shot of the ship’s chronometer, along with Charlton Heston’s scien-
tific monolog, would have been plenty to satisfy just about any fan of serious sci-
ence fiction. But the director (Franklin J. Schaffner) and screenwriters (Michael 
Wilson and Rod Serling) went even further. As Charlton Heston gets ever more 
philosophical about human life on Earth, and his own place in the universe, we see 
more shots of the chronometer, showing the days passing on Earth. The rate at 
which time passes on Earth is roughly three days for every 90  s of ship time. 
Converting days into seconds gives 3 day = 3 × 24 h × 3600 s/h = 259,200 s of Earth 
time for every 90 s of ship time. We can use this information to calculate the current 
speed of the ship at the time of the monolog:

which is somewhat faster than the average speed of the ship, as calculated from the 
702 years Earth time and 6 months ship time. This is direct evidence that the ship 
has not been traveling at a constant speed for its entire trip but has undergone some 
acceleration. It’s rare for a science fiction film to treat the science at this level of 
detail! Unfortunately, the difference between the current speed of the ship and the

Estimation 2.6: Relativistic Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox
A year-long experiment conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) pro-
vides us with a real-life application of the twin paradox. From March 27, 2015, 
through March 1, 2016, U.S., astronaut Scott Kelly spent nearly a year aboard the 
International Space Station, while his identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, remained 
on Earth. Let’s make the simplifying assumption that the twins, Scott and Mark, 
were exactly the same age when Scott took off for the ISS. Visit NASA’s official 
website for the ISS and look up its speed, relative to the surface of the Earth. Use 
this speed and the time that Scott Kelly spent aboard the ISS to calculate how much 
older his twin brother, Mark, would be when Scott returned to Earth.
Discussion Topic 2.2
Based on these calculations, what do you conclude about the possibility (at least in 
principle) of traveling into the future? If you believe it might be possible, how would 
it be done? Does the concept of time dilation, as expressed by Eq. (2.4), allow for 
the possibility of traveling into the past? Why not?
2.3.2  General Relativity and Distortion of Spacetime
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity describes the distortion of spacetime in the 
presence of large masses, such as stars or planets. Space is stretched out and time 
runs more slowly, compared to regions of space that are far away from large masses. 
The gravitational time dilation effect is expressed in equation form as follows:
	
t
t
Gm
rc
r =
−
∞1
2
2 ,
	
(2.5)
where G is Newton’s universal gravitational constant, m is the mass of the object 
creating the gravitational field, r is the distance from the center of the massive 
object, and c is the speed of light. The subscripts, r and ∞, indicate the time as 
measured at a distance r from the gravitational source, and the time measured far 
from any source of gravitational distortion, respectively.
We have already seen that the effect of time dilation due to relative speed (Eq. 2.4) 
can actually be measured, thanks to the high precision of atomic clocks. Shortly, we 
will consider an example of present-day technology which simply would not work 
without taking into account both time dilation due to relative speed and time dilation 
due to gravity. But first we pause to consider the question, what exactly is gravity?
In the classical (Newtonian) worldview, gravity is a force which acts instanta-
neously, over an arbitrary distance, between any two objects with mass. But accord-
ing to Einstein, the effect which we experience as gravity is simply the result of the 
distortion of the four-dimensional fabric of space in the vicinity of a large mass. 
2  What Is the Nature of Space and Time? (The Physics of Space Travel and Time Travel)

33
Furthermore, if you are inside a closed box (one from within which you are unable 
to see the outside world), you would not be able distinguish between the effects of 
distorted space (gravity) and uniform acceleration. This effect, which is known as 
Einstein’s principle of equivalence, can be experienced and measured using the 
simple equipment shown in Fig. E.1, in the Appendix of Artifacts.
In order to experience Einstein’s principle of equivalence first-hand, all you have 
to do is take a ride on an elevator and measure the apparent force on an object during 
the brief moments of acceleration, when the elevator begins to move and when it 
comes to a stop. If you did not know that the elevator was accelerating, the change 
in the measured force could just as easily be interpreted as a momentary change in 
the distortion of space, resulting in an increase or decrease in the apparent strength 
of the force of gravity acting on the object.
Table 2.2 shows the results of a field project conducted on a university campus, 
to measure the apparent change in force on an object in an elevator, during the brief 
moments of acceleration. An object, whose weight at rest is approximately 0.5 N, 
was suspended from a spring scale, with a full-scale reading of 1.00 N, and a resolu-
tion of 0.01 N. The scale reading was recorded during acceleration of the elevator 
under two different conditions: when the elevator is starting from rest and moving 
upward, and when the elevator is coming to a stop while moving downward. 
Measurements were taken on nine different elevators around campus. The results 
are expressed as a multiple of g, the acceleration due to gravity.
The results in Table 2.2 indicate that the acceleration experienced in a typical 
passenger elevator is approximately one-tenth of the acceleration due to gravity. 
There appears to be a slightly larger acceleration when stopping, going downward, 
compared to starting and going upward, but the difference is not statistically signifi-
cant. The field project could be turned into a contest to find which elevator in which 
department on campus gives the smoothest ride or the roughest ride. But the main 
point of the project is to illustrate the equivalency of acceleration and the gravita-
tional distortion of spacetime.
Einstein’s principle of equivalence can be put to practical use to create artificial 
gravity, as illustrated by two scenes in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. As men-
tioned in the previous chapter, early in the movie we see a space station, shaped like 
a large wheel, in orbit around Earth. The wheel rotates to simulate the force of grav-
ity for passengers around the inside of the rim. Later in the movie, the effect is 
illustrated on a smaller scale. It is well known that muscles will atrophy under con-
ditions of microgravity. In order to reduce this effect, an interplanetary spaceship 
might be built with a section which rotates at a constant speed. An astronaut could

with having coined the term black hole, he insists that he did not invent it, but simply 
popularized it. In his memoirs, published in 1998, he gives the exact date and loca-
tion of the talk in which he first used the term: 29 December 1967, at a Sigma Xi-Phi 
Beta Kappa lecture at the New York Hilton hotel. But he credits an unknown member 
of the audience at a previous talk, which he gave in the fall of 1967, at NASA’s 
Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, for proposing the term, as a sim-
pler way of referring to a “gravitationally completely collapsed object” [22].
Black holes of tens or hundreds of solar masses exist throughout the galaxy, and 
supermassive black holes may exist at the centers of galaxies throughout the uni-
verse. In fact, history was made on April 10, 2019, when the Event Horizon 
Telescope collaboration released the first direct image of a supermassive black hole. 
Located at the center of galaxy Messier 87, the black hole is 6.5 billion times more 
massive than our Sun [23]. But black holes can also be created on a much smaller 
scale in high energy particle collisions. This effect led to considerable public outcry 
about the safety of particle accelerators, and the wisdom of conducting research in 
high energy physics.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland, is the 
largest particle accelerator in the world. Straddling the border between France and 
Switzerland, the main accelerator ring of the LHC is 16.7 miles in circumference 
and is designed primarily to collide high energy protons. We will consider the LHC 
and its research objectives in more detail in the next chapter. Before the LHC was 
scheduled to be turned on for the first time in September, 2008, there was wide-
spread concern over the possibility that a black hole would be created. People feared 
that a black hole would suck in all the matter around it and destroy the world. 
Among the more tongue-in-cheek responses was the painting of a landmark fence 
on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University, by some of our students, in com-
memoration of the scheduled start-up of the LHC, on 10 September 2008 (Fig. 2.6). 
The words on the fence include a famous song lyric “It’s the end of the world, as we 
know it, and I feel fine.”
The public fear and misperception of the LHC may have been fueled, in part, by a 
sci-fi movie, released just a few years earlier. The 2005 movie, The Black Hole, depicts 
the devastation that results when a black hole is created at a fictitious particle research 
facility near St. Louis, MO [24]. The proposed solution to the problem is more typical 
of sci-fi movies of the 1950s, than the early twenty-first century: full nuclear strike!

Unfortunately for the people of St. Louis, and for the rest of the world, this is a com-
pletely counterproductive proposal. If you throw more matter and energy, of whatever 
form, into a black hole, you are not likely to blow it up. You’ll just make it bigger.
So the question remains, is it possible for a high energy particle accelerator to 
create a black hole? And if so, what is the best thing to do about it? The answer to 
the first question is yes! Microscopic black holes are, indeed, created in high energy 
collisions, of the sort that happen all the time in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. High 
energy protons from supernova explosions race through the galaxy. When one of 
these particles collides with matter in the Earth’s ionosphere, the result can be a 
microscopic black hole—a singularity of density. But thanks to the research of 
Stephen Hawking, we understand that such microscopic black holes do not last long 
enough to accrete enough additional mass to cause the kind of devastation depicted 
in the movie The Black Hole. This effect, first described in a 1974 paper by Hawking, 
now bears his name: Hawking radiation [25]. So the answer to the second question 
is just leave them alone, and they will evaporate.
After a number of technical difficulties associated with its initial start-up, the 
LHC operated successfully for 10 years, gathering enormous amounts of data, 
which will help to answer some fundamental questions about the structure of the 
universe. We will take up some of these questions later in this book. The good news 
is that during its 10 years of operation, no black holes were ever observed eating 
France or Switzerland. For those who are interested in more details about the con-
nection between black holes and particle accelerators, the press office at CERN 
have addressed the issue and the concerns very thoroughly on their web site [26]. 
The LHC shut down in December, 2018, for 2 years of planned upgrades and is 
expected to resume operation in 2021.
The concept of an event horizon can be formalized with reference to Eq. (2.5) 
(gravitational time dilation). The quantity 2Gm/c2 in Eq. (2.5) has dimensions of 
length and is known as the Schwarzschild radius:
	
r
Gm
c
s
.
= 2
2
	
(2.6)
It is possible for an object to have such a large mass that its Schwarzschild radius 
is larger than its physical radius. Anything that approaches the object closer than the 
Schwarzschild radius (or event horizon) can never escape. Thus, a black hole need 
not be infinitely dense. It just has to have a sufficiently large mass to create an event 
horizon at a radius greater than its physical radius.
Estimation 2.8: What Would It Take for the Moon to Become a Black Hole?
The animated comedy Despicable Me tells the story of Gru, a creative genius turned 
to a life of crime after many failed attempts to receive validation for his remarkable 
talent. His latest scheme is to commit the greatest crime in history: to steal the Moon. 
Gru uses a “shrink ray” to reduce the Moon to the size of a grapefruit [27]. Consult 
your favorite source of reliable information to find the mass of the Moon. Use

Eq. (2.6) to calculate the Schwarzschild radius for the Moon. If Gru shrinks the 
Moon down to the size of a grapefruit, is he in danger of creating a black hole? 
(Fig. 2.7).
The 2009 movie Star Trek treats black holes in a way that has absolutely no basis in 
reality, but will provide a prelude for our discussion of wormholes later in this chapter. 
Director J.J. Abrams creates an alternate universe scenario, touched off by a catastrophic 
accident. A star within the territory of the Romulan Empire is about to become a super-
nova and (so we are told) threatens to destroy the galaxy. The proposed solution is to 
create a black hole inside the star and stop the supernova from expanding. Unfortunately, 
the plan is executed too late to prevent the destruction of Romulus, the home planet of 
the Romulans. But what does occur changes the course of history. Or to put it more 
precisely, it transports the audience into an alternate universe, in which the flow of his-
tory is completely different from the one that generations of Star Trek fans knew [28]. 
Two ships, one piloted by Spock, the Vulcan ambassador (played by Leonard Nimoy) 
who was attempting to stop the supernova, and another piloted by Nero, a Romulan 
miner (played by Eric Bana), get caught in the gravitational field of the black hole and 
are pulled in. The Romulan ship and then the Vulcan ship go through the black hole and 
end up in the past. Their subsequent actions change the course of history.
As brilliant as this movie is, from an entertainment perspective, this scenario 
could never occur. Based on our understanding of the properties of black holes, both 
ships would be destroyed by the extreme distortion of the fabric of spacetime. Spock 
and Nero would die and history would continue to unfold undisturbed.

rocks the Federation starship Excelsior [31]. We have already considered the distor-
tion of spacetime due to the presence of a large mass, which results in the experi-
ence of the force of gravity. But suppose something catastrophic happens to a large 
mass, such as the explosion of Praxis, or many orders of magnitude larger, the 
explosion of a supernova? Could this cause a wave of distorted spacetime, which 
might propagate outward and be felt (or measured) at a large distance away? 100 
years after Einstein’s prediction, the effect which he believed to be too small to 
measure was confirmed experimentally and announced to the public. On September 
14, 2015, the twin research facilities in the United States, known as LIGO (Laser 
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory), made the first direct experimental 
observations of gravitational waves caused by the merger of two black holes. Their 
sister facility in Italy, Virgo, was offline for upgrades at the time. The results were 
published in February 2016, confirming Einstein’s prediction of 100 years earlier 
[32]. The work resulted in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2017 to 
Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne “for decisive contributions to the LIGO 
detector and the observation of gravitational waves.”
The LIGO facilities, one of which is located in Hanford, Washington, and the 
other in Livingston, Louisiana, measured minute displacements of their laser-­
reflecting mirrors. The mirrors are located at opposite ends of 4 km-long arms and 
carefully aligned to create a pattern of interference of the laser light. A schematic 
illustration is shown in Fig. 2.8. The distortion of space due to the passage of a

destroy living tissue. Thus all of the crew must evacuate the ship and take with them 
any vital biological materials from the ship’s medical facility [1].
So what exactly is a baryon, and what effect would a baryon sweep have on a star-
ship? At the quantum scale, the Standard Model of Particle Physics describes all of 
matter and energy (except for gravity) in terms of 17 fundamental particles. These are 
divided into quarks (the massive constituents of matter), leptons (from the Greek for 
delicate or minute), and the force-communicator particles, as illustrated in Table 3.1.
Quarks are never observed in isolation, under ordinary conditions. They are always 
confined within composite particles, which we will discuss shortly. But one of the lep-
tons, namely the electron, is part of everyday experience. Where would modern culture 
be without electrons, which carry the current used by all of our electronic devices?
Next, we need to define some terminology. Our discussion of black holes, in Chap. 
2, included reference to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s largest particle 
accelerator. But what is a hadron? The word hadron is a general term, which refers to 
anything made of any number of quarks. Two specific types of hadrons deserve par-
ticular mention. A meson, as the term is used today, is a composite particle made of 
two quarks (or more specifically, a quark–antiquark pair). A baryon (from the Greek 
for massive or heavy) is a particle composed of three quarks. Two examples of baryon 
particles are the proton and the neutron, the particles which make up the nuclei of all 
atoms. A proton is a baryon which consists of two up quarks and one down quark. A 
neutron is a baryon which consists of one up quark and two down quarks.
Finally, we come to the irony of the baryon sweep in “Starship Mine.” The ship’s 
doctor is right to be concerned about the tissue samples stored in her medical facil-
ity, which would be destroyed in the baryon sweep. But the Captain of the Enterprise 
should be equally concerned about the ship, itself. Undoubtedly, by the twenty-­
fourth century, several new atoms will have been discovered, which have not yet 
been discovered in the twenty-first century. Some of these yet-to-be-discovered 
atoms may even be incorporated into the high-tech material that makes up the star-
ship Enterprise. Yet all atoms must be made of protons and neutrons. In effect, all 
of the material of the ship is composed of baryons, and will be swept away, along 
with the excess accumulated baryons.

As shown in Table 3.1 the fundamental particles of the Standard Model are subdi-
vided into two categories: the fermions, or fundamental particles of matter, and the 
bosons, or communicators of the fundamental interactions of physics. Collectively 
these particles represent more than a century of theoretical and experimental research.
3.1.1  Fermions: The Fundamental Particles of Matter
The fundamental particles of matter in the left two columns of Table 3.1 are col-
lectively referred to as fermions, in honor of Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–
1954). The fermions are divided into two types of particles: quarks and leptons. 
These, in turn, are subdivided into three so-called generations. A number of features 
distinguish the quarks from the leptons, including their charge (leptons have either 
one unit of charge or no charge, while quarks have fractional charge) and their mass 
(quarks are much more massive than leptons). A summary of the properties of the 
fermions and their years of experimental discovery is shown in Table 3.2 (the lep-
tons) and Table 3.3 (the quarks).
Perhaps the most familiar of the fermions is the electron, which was also the first 
of the fundamental particles to be discovered. In 1897 J.J. Thomson demonstrated 
that electrically neutral matter contains discrete negatively charged particles, to 
which he gave the name “corpuscles.” By applying electric and magnetic fields to a 
beam of these particles, Thomson was able to measure the ratio of their charge 
divided by their mass. In 1909, Robert Millikan performed an experiment which 
enabled the measurement of the charge on the electron. Millikan created charged 
droplets of oil and balanced the force of gravity on the oil droplets by applying an 
electric field. The results of the Millikan “oil drop” experiment, together with 
Thomson’s “e/m” experiment enabled the determination of the mass of the electron.
The muon is the second of the leptons to be discovered experimentally (by 
Anderson and Neddermeyer, at Caltech in 1936). Its mass, which is roughly 207 
times the mass of the electron, lies in between the electron mass and the proton mass

(roughly 1836 times the mass of the electron). Thus, at the time when it was discov-
ered, an appropriate label for this particle was “meson,” from the Greek for “in 
between” or “medium.” Although other names were proposed, the term “meson” 
gained general acceptance [2]. It wasn’t until other new particles of intermediate 
mass were discovered that the specific label “mu meson” began to be used. But the 
language of particle physics has evolved over time. As the standard model was com-
ing together in the ‘60s and ‘70s, the terminology used to describe the various par-
ticles and composites was refined. As noted above, the word meson is now restricted 
to composite particles consisting of a quark and an antiquark.
Neutrinos have no charge, are very difficult to detect and were originally believed 
to have zero mass. But when neutrinos interact with matter, they can oscillate (or 
change form) among the various generations of neutrino. This behavior requires that 
they have some nonzero mass. The precise values of the neutrino masses is a topic 
of ongoing research.
3.1.2  Bosons: The Force-Communicator Particles 
of the Standard Model
The particles of the Standard Model which communicate the fundamental interac-
tions of physics are collectively referred to as bosons, in honor of Indian physicist 
Satyendra Nath Bose (1894–1974). To the best of our knowledge, there are four 
fundamental forces (or interactions) in physics: electromagnetism, the weak nuclear 
force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity. A simple apparatus to demonstrate 
simultaneously all four of the fundamental forces of physics is shown in Fig. E.2, in 
the Appendix of Artifacts. At the current time, only three of these forces have been 
successfully included within the Standard Model, as shown in Table 3.4. The first of 
these, the electromagnetic force, is communicated by the photon—a quantum par-
ticle of electromagnetic radiation. Prior to the mid-1800s, electricity and magnetism

aUnlike the leptons, quarks are always confined within hadrons and are never observed as free 
particles. Consequently, their masses cannot be measured directly but must be determined indi-
rectly from their influences on the properties of hadrons [3]

were understood to be two separate and unrelated phenomena. Thanks to the work 
of James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), who described light as an electromagnetic 
wave, electricity and magnetism were unified into a single phenomenon. But it was 
Albert Einstein who proposed that light should be conceived of not as a wave but as 
a particle—a packet of energy, which we now call a photon. It was his theory of the 
photoelectric effect (not his theories of relativity!) for which Einstein was awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.
The weak nuclear force, mediated by the so-called W and Z bosons, is respon-
sible for radioactive beta decay, which we will discuss in some detail later in this 
chapter. The discovery of the W and Z bosons in 1983, by Rubia and van der Meer, 
garnered them the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1984. Their discovery provided exper-
imental evidence of the unification of the weak force and the electromagnetic force 
into a single electroweak interaction, as predicted by Glashow, Weinberg, and 
Salam, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1979.
The strong nuclear force, mediated by the gluon, is what holds quarks together and 
binds the nuclear particles (protons and neutrons) together within the nucleus of an 
atom. It is also involved in the alpha decay process. The first direct experimental evi-
dence for the existence of the gluon was produced in 1979 by the TASSO collaboration, 
using the PETRA electron–positron collider at the DESY facility in Hamburg, Germany.
The fourth of the fundamental forces, gravity, is not yet included in the Standard 
Model. As noted in the previous chapter, the various theories of quantum gravity 
have made predictions which are difficult or impossible to test experimentally. So 
we do not yet know if there is such a thing as a graviton—the quantum particle 
which might communicate the force of gravity.
The 2015 discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO facility confirmed one of 
Einstein’s predictions, but it did not provide any new insight into the possibility of 
quantum gravity. At best, an upper bound of 1.2 × 10−22 eV/c2 was set on the possi-
ble mass of the graviton [4]. If the graviton exists, it is theoretically predicted to be 
a zero mass particle. The upper bound set by LIGO is at least 20 orders of magni-
tude less than the lower bound on the neutrino mass.

3.1.3  The Mystery of Mass and the Higgs Boson
The discovery of the W and Z bosons not only confirmed the unification of the weak 
force with electromagnetism, but also prompted an interesting question. As shown 
in Table 3.4, the W and Z bosons have mass but the photon and the gluon do not. 
Why should this be? In fact, why should any of the particles of the Standard Model 
have mass? One of the research objectives of the Large Hadron Collider was to find 
experimental evidence of the Higgs boson, which was hypothesized to confer mass 
on the other particles of the Standard Model. According to a theory proposed by 
Peter Higgs and others in 1964, the particles of the Standard Model acquire mass by 
interacting with the Higgs field, an energy field which was hypothesized to perme-
ate the entire universe. On July 4, 2012, an announcement was made at the LHC that 
a particle consistent with the Higgs boson at last had been observed by the ATLAS 
and the CMS experiments. This discovery resulted in the awarding of the 2013 
Nobel Prize in Physics jointly to François Englert and Peter Higgs [5]. Thus, the 
Standard Model was set on an even firmer foundation.
3.2  Beyond the Standard Model: Dark Matter and Dark 
Energy
As successful as the Standard Model has been, it accounts for only a small fraction 
of the matter and energy in the universe (see Fig. 3.1). Recent estimates suggest that 
only about 5% of the total matter and energy inventory of the universe is ordinary 
(baryonic) matter. 27% of the universe is so-called dark matter, which interacts with 
the visible matter in the universe through the force of gravity but is otherwise not 
currently understood. 68% of the universe is dark energy, which is responsible for 
the accelerating expansion of the universe.

matter and energy in the

64
the DES project also made a measurement of the dark matter structure of the uni-
verse. Analysis of the data gathered by the DES project is likely to take many years 
but is expected to shed light on the 95% of the matter and energy in the universe, 
which is currently not understood.
3.3  The Atomic Nucleus: Protons, Neutrons, Isotopes, 
and Radioactivity
The fundamental building blocks of matter are the quarks and leptons of the Standard 
Model (Table 3.1). One of the leptons—the electron—is part of our everyday experi-
ence, but we do not encounter quarks in isolation. They are bound together as the 
constituents of protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms. Atoms, in 
turn, can be assembled into higher-level configurations, such as molecules and a vari-
ety of crystal structures, some of which we will examine in detail later in this chapter. 
Before exploring the interactions of matter and energy, we pause briefly to consider 
the nucleus of the atom, with the help of one of the classic sci-fi films of the 1950s.
Forbidden Planet opens with the crew of a spaceship from Earth making prepa-
rations to land on Altair-4, the fourth planet in the Altair star system. Upon arrival, 
they notice a cloud of dust approaching the ship, stirred up by a fast-moving vehicle, 
but with no apparent driver. When the vehicle stops, the crew are greeted by an 
extremely polite robot, named Robby, who has been instructed to transport several 
of them to the residence of Morbius, the sole survivor of a previous expedition from

maybe colliding with objects inside the ship, or with other molecules, or other walls 
of the ship, until they eventually come back into the neighborhood of the hole. The 
motion of gas molecules inside a container is a random process. But we can think 
about what happens on average. If we want to know how many of the molecules (on 
average) will escape through the hole, we only need to consider 1/6 of the total 
number of molecules near the hole, namely the ones that are moving not only in a 
direction perpendicular to the wall, but actually toward the hole (and not away from 
it). Whether or not a particular molecule will actually escape through the hole in a 
small time interval (let’s call it Δt) depends on how close it is to the hole and how 
fast it is moving. The average speed, v, of an object is defined as its change in posi-
tion (Δx) divided by the corresponding change in time (Δt):

Consider the air molecule in Fig. 3.3, which is traveling toward the hole. That 
molecule will escape through the hole within a time Δt if its speed, v, is large enough 
for it to travel the length of the little cylinder, Δx, in that time interval. We can now 
estimate the number of molecules that will escape in a small time Δt, if we know the 
density of molecules (number per unit volume in the ship) and the average speed of 
the molecules. Suppose the total number of air molecules in the entire ship is n, and 
the total volume of the ship is V. The small number of molecules, Δn, which will

escape through the hole in a small time interval Δt, is approximately 1/6 of the 
number of molecules within the little cylinder in Fig. 3.3. This is just the number per

have 1012 atoms in the microcrystal. Despite its small size, the interesting physical prop-
erties (electrical, magnetic, optical, and so forth) are not significantly different from the 
properties of the same material in the bulk (macroscopic crystal). So it is unlikely that 
Dr. Crusher’s tricorder is detecting the presence of microcrystals in the material of the 
floor. So back to the original question: What is microcrystalline damage, and what 
might be the signature of this effect, enabling it to be detected by the tricorder?
In particles of sufficiently small size, the electrons behave differently than they do 
in macroscopic (or even microscopic) materials. In effect, they sense that they are 
confined in a small space. One way of thinking about this is to imagine yourself in the 
interior of a large crystal with simple cubic structure (same separation between identi-
cal atoms along each of the three coordinate axes). No matter which direction you 
move through the crystal, the world looks exactly the same, until you get to the sur-
face of the crystal. Suddenly, the world looks different outside the crystal than it does 
in the interior. Electrons can sense that they are confined in a small space if the num-
ber of atoms on the surface of the material is a significant fraction of the total number 
of atoms. This is the case in materials at the nanoscale (edge lengths of approximately 
10−9 m). As a result of the significant surface effects, the physical properties of the 
material (electric, magnetic, optical, etc.) can be measurably different from the same 
properties in bulk material. So instead of microcrystalline damage, the effect that Dr. 
Crusher was detecting might more appropriately be called nanocrystalline damage. 
In other words, the energy of the weapon disrupted some of the material down to the 
nanoscale, resulting in measurably different physical properties.

76
Estimation 3.3: Atoms Inside and on the Surface of a Nanoparticle
Estimate the number of atoms in a nanoparticle (a particle of matter, whose size is 
approximately 10−9 m). Of the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle, how many of 
the atoms are on the surface of the particle, compared to the number in the interior?
An extreme example of a nanoparticle is the relatively recently discovered 
Buckyball—a stable molecule consisting of exactly 60 carbon atoms, arranged in a 
cage-like structure, resembling a soccer ball (Fig. 3.5). All of the atoms are on the 
surface, with nothing in the interior. This structure may be compared to the two crys-
talline forms of carbon, graphite, and diamond. Although these materials are made of 
the same kind of atom, graphite and diamond have different crystal structures (hex-
agonal and diamond-cubic, respectively), giving them physical properties which dif-
fer significantly from each other, and both are significantly different from Buckyballs.
3.6.1  Density of Solids
We pause for a moment to answer a question posed in the previous chapter. Why is it 
that the military hovercraft in the James Bond movie Die Another Day could float over 
a minefield without triggering the mines, but the giant attack ships in Independence 
Day would crush an entire city, just by hovering over it? Did you find the flaw in the 
Fig. 3.5  Model of a Carbon-60 molecule (Buckyball). (Photo by the author)

analysis? The answer lies in the density of the mother ship in Independence Day, 
which we never actually needed to calculate separately, in order to solve the original 
problem. The standard approach to solving a physics problem is to work out the alge-
bra first and then to plug in the necessary numbers once you have the algebraic expres-
sion for the quantity that you want. Although the assumptions we made were 
reasonable, some of the data provided in the movie were completely implausible. 
Since we were interested in the pressure under the attack ship, we didn’t stop along 
the way to calculate the density. Let’s do that now, and compare the density of the 
mother ship in Independence Day to the density of real solid materials. Recall that the 
diameter of the mother ship was given in the movie as 550 km, and the mass was ¼ 
the mass of the Moon. A reasonable assumption is that the mother ship is approxi-
mately spherical in shape. We can calculate the density as follows:

This gives us the density of the mother ship of approximately 211,000 kg/m3. 
Compare this to Osmium, which has the highest density of any known material: 
22,600 kg/m3. So given the data in the movie, the mother ship would have an aver-
age density ten times greater than any known material on Earth.
3.7  Phase Transitions
The illustration of crystal structure, as suggested by Fig. 3.4, is inadequate in at least 
one important respect. The atoms in any solid are not rigidly connected to one 
another, as balls on rigid sticks. They are more like balls attached to one another by 
flexible springs. The springs represent the interatomic bonds, which hold the atoms 
together in solid form. At any finite temperature, the atoms are constantly vibrating. 
The higher the temperature, the greater the vibration will become. At sufficiently 
high temperature, the vibrations may exceed the ability of the interatomic bonds to 
hold the material together. The long-range order of the crystal breaks down, and the

bomb set to go off in 3 min. They manage to escape, thanks to a clever gadget: a 
laser small enough to be concealed in a wristwatch, yet powerful enough to cut 
through the floor plate.
The science of the process can be described in simple terms. The energy of the 
laser beam, in the form of light, is absorbed by the metal of the floor plate, convert-
ing it into heat. The heat energy raises the temperature of the metal up to the melting 
point. Then more energy is needed to convert the solid metal into liquid. The liquid 
metal drips harmlessly onto the ground, underneath the railroad car. The laser beam 
is slowly moved along the floor plate, melting more metal, and tracing the outline of 
a rectangle large enough for a person to jump through to safety. How powerful 
would a laser have to be to do the job?
We already know from our discussion of Goldfinger that industrial lasers power-
ful enough to cut through solid metal have existed since 1964. But a more interest-
ing technological question might be could a laser of this sort be powered by a battery 
in a wristwatch? We can begin to address the question by looking at the definition 
of power. Power is the ratio of the energy delivered over an interval of time, or

volume times the density. And the volume is just the product of the total length of the 
channel times the width of the laser beam times the thickness of the floor. So we have:

floor thickness

Let’s assume that the railroad car is made of steel, with a density of 8000 kg/m3. 
The minimum channel length could be taken as 2 m (a square with edge length 
0.5 m). The laser beam diameter is roughly 0.001 m (1 mm) and the floor thickness 
is 0.025 m (1 in.). This gives us a mass of 0.4 kg. Next, we need to determine the 
amount of heat energy, Q, needed to melt this much steel. Some approximate values 
of the physical constants for steel are given below:

In Eq. (3.10), we need the change in temperature, ΔT, which is just the difference 
between the melting point and the initial temperature. Let’s assume that the floor starts 
out approximately at room temperature (300 K). This gives ΔT = 1500 K. Substituting 
these values into Eq. (3.10), along with the mass, m = 0.4 kg, we get

Finally, we can use Eq. (3.9) to calculate the power required for the wristwatch 
laser to deliver this amount of heat in the necessary time. If the bomb is set to go off 
in 3 min, they need time not only to cut the hole in the floor, but also to jump through 
the hole and run to safety. So let’s say 2.5 min to be safe. The power required is

tion is, could a laser this sort be powered by a battery in a wristwatch?
The process of melting a solid is reversible. We can also think about a phase 
transition in the opposite direction, from liquid state to solid state. This physical 
process is also described by Eq. (3.10), but the heat involved is negative. Instead of 
raising the temperature to the melting point, we lower the temperature to the freez-

3.8  Transparency and Invisibility: Optical Properties 
of Solids
When visible light interacts with matter, a number of things can happen, depending 
on the nature of the object and the properties of the material that the object is made 
of. Some of the important effects include scattering from rough surfaces or small 
particles, reflection from smooth surfaces, transmission through the material, and 
absorption in the material. All of these effects are common, everyday experiences. 
Air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light more efficiently than longer 
wavelengths. Thus, the sky appears reddish at sunset because red light from the Sun 
is not scattered as much as blue light, as it passes through the atmosphere. For the 
same reason, the sky on a bright, sunny day appears bluish: more blue light from the 
Sun is scattered toward our eyes from the air molecules overhead. Large droplets of 
water vapor, which form clouds, tend to scatter all wavelengths of light equally 
well. So clouds on a sunny day appear white. (The Moon has no atmosphere to scat-
ter sunlight, so the sky on the Moon is always black, and the stars are always visi-
ble.) Rough surfaces scatter light diffusely (random scattering in all directions), 
while very smooth surfaces can give a uniform reflection. But what material proper-
ties determine whether or not light can travel through a solid object, and is it pos-
sible to render a solid object completely invisible?
3.8.1  Transparent Solids
We return to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which we discussed previously in the 
context of time travel. To recap the storyline, Earth’s oceans are being vaporized by 
a giant probe, of unknown origin, which is trying to contact humpback whales. 
Unfortunately, by the twenty-third century, this species had been hunted to extinc-
tion. Thanks to Mr. Spock’s calculations, the officers of the Enterprise, traveling in 
a stolen Klingon bird of prey, have successfully gone back in time to Earth, in the 
late twentieth century, in search of humpback whales. Lt. Uhura (played by Nichelle 
Nichols) detects whale song coming from the general direction of San Francisco. 
3.8  Transparency and Invisibility: Optical Properties of Solids

They locate a pair of humpback whales, named “George” and “Gracie”, conve-
niently sheltered in a marine park, in Sausalito. Their only problem now is how to 
transport the whales (and enough water to keep them alive) back to the twenty-third 
century, to appease the giant probe.
Part of the problem is an ethical one: the whales are not simply theirs for the tak-
ing. To quote Spock, “We would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.” 
The task falls to Captain Kirk to use his charm to convince Dr. Gillian Taylor 
(Catherine Hicks), the cetacean biologist responsible for the care of the whales, that 
it is in everyone’s best interest (including the whales) to cooperate. The rest of the 
problem is technological: how to build a giant aquarium in the cargo bay of the 
spacecraft. Chief engineer Scott (James Doohan), with the assistance of Dr. McCoy 
(DeForest Kelley), poses as a visiting professor from Edinburgh on an invited tour, 
to study manufacturing methods at a nearby thermoplastics plant. Following the 
tour, conducted personally by plant manager Dr. Nichols (Alex Henteloff), Professor 
Scott makes an intriguing offer. He begins with a curious observation.
“I see you’re still working with polymers.”
“Still?” Nichols responds. “What else would I be working with?”
“Aye, what else, indeed?” Having captured Nichols’ attention, Scotty continues, “How 
thick would a piece of your Plexiglass have to be, at 60 feet by 10 feet, to withstand the 
pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?”
“Oh, that’s easy,” Nichols replies, “Six inches. We carry it that big in stock.”
“Aye, I’ve noticed. Now suppose, just suppose, I could show you how to manufacture a 
wall that would do the same job as your Plexiglass but would be only one inch thick. Would 
that be worth something to you?”
“You’re joking.”
“Perhaps the Professor could use your computer,” suggests Dr. McCoy.
“Be my guest,” Nichols offers, still skeptical.
Scotty approaches Dr. Nichols’ Macintosh computer and addresses it with the standard 
Star Fleet command: “Computer.” The Macintosh, which was state-of-the-art in personal 
computing in the mid-1980s, fails to respond to this twenty-third century verbal command. 
“Computer,” Scotty repeats, but to no avail. Dr. McCoy picks up the mouse and hands it to 
Scotty, who addresses it yet again – this time by speaking into the bottom of the mouse – 
“Hello, computer.” Still no response. Finally, Dr. Nichols suggests, “Just use the keyboard.”
“A keyboard,” Scotty says, with disdain, “How quaint.” After cracking his knuckles in 
preparation, and quickly tapping away at the keyboard for a few seconds, he produces an 
animated image on the screen: the molecular structure of transparent aluminum. [23]
Dr. Nichols evidently found this offer sufficiently interesting, and potentially 
lucrative, that he agreed to a trade. Scotty got the sheets of Plexiglass, which he 
would later use to make the whale aquarium in the Klingon ship, in exchange for the 
formula for transparent aluminum.
But should Dr. Nichols have remained skeptical? Could a product made mostly 
of aluminum be a good substitute for Plexiglass, whose durability and transparency 
make it a popular substitute for glass? To answer this question we need to under-
stand something about the behavior of electrons in solid materials.
Earlier in this chapter we discussed the details of the atomic nucleus, which con-
tains most of the mass of an atom in the form of protons and neutrons. All atoms also 
have at least one electron in orbit around the nucleus, and neutral atoms (atoms with 
no net electric charge) have the same number of electrons in orbit as they have protons 
3  What Is the Universe Made of? (Matter, Energy, and Interactions)

85
in the nucleus. When atoms come together to form a solid, some of the outermost 
electrons in the individual atoms become somewhat delocalized and are shared with 
neighboring atoms, forming interatomic bonds. We might refer to these as valence 
electrons. Other electrons may remain in orbit around their individual atoms, much as 
they would be in an isolated atom, by itself. We might refer to these as the core elec-
trons. There are some solid materials in which these are the only two possibilities for 
the electrons, under ordinary conditions: all of the electrons either remain localized 
around individual atoms, or they participate in the interatomic bonds, which are nec-
essary to hold the material together as a solid. We call these materials insulators.
But not all solids are insulators. In some materials, there is a third possibility for the 
electrons. Materials, which we classify as metals, have some electrons which do not 
remain in orbit around individual atoms, nor do they participate in interatomic bonds, 
but are completely free to move throughout the material. These are called conduction 
electrons because they make possible the conduction of electric current (Table 3.5).
The presence or absence of conduction electrons affects not only the electrical 
properties of a solid (conducting or insulating), but also the optical properties. 
Metals are opaque primarily because the conduction electrons readily absorb the 
energy of visible light. The light energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the 
electrons, which move through the material. Insulating materials, by contrast, have 
no electrons which are free to move. They are bound to individual atoms, or shared 
between neighboring atoms, in such a way that the light energy is not irretrievably 
absorbed by the material.
Ordinary glass is made primarily of silicon dioxide, which is an insulating material.
It has no conduction electrons to absorb the energy of visible light. If the glass is 
made sufficiently pure and uniform (free of little specks of dirt or air bubbles, which 
will scatter the light, making it appear cloudy) it will be transparent, and suitable for 
making windows. Plexiglass (or poly-methylmethacrylate) is also an insulator. Although 
it is softer than glass, and somewhat more easily scratched, it can be polished and made 
as pure and transparent as glass. Aluminum, on the other hand, is a metal, and metals 
have conduction electrons, which absorb the energy of visible light. Pure aluminum is 
opaque. The only way to make aluminum transparent is to combine it chemically with 
other elements, into a molecular structure which is insulating. One such material is 
aluminum oxide (Al2O3), which in pure form is a ­completely transparent, crystalline 
mineral, known as corundum. (Add a bit of cobalt to Al2O3, and you get a blue gem-
stone called sapphire. Substitute chromium for the cobalt, and you get ruby.) But this 
could not be the transparent aluminum of the Star Trek movie. It would be next to 
impossible to manufacture a large wall of pure Al2O3. And even if it were possible, a 
1-in. thick slab of such material could not withstand the pressure of 18,000 ft3 of water.

where the subscript r indicates the quantity relative to the same quantity in

There are no naturally occurring materials with negative index of refraction, but the 
possibility was explored theoretically in the 1960s [32]. Recent work has shown that it 
is possible to engineer a material that has negative values for both the permittivity and 
the permeability, which opens the possibility of a negative index of refraction [33, 34].
Materials with negative index of refraction are called metamaterials. (The Greek 
prefix meta-, meaning change, is a way of emphasizing that such materials do not 
occur in nature but must be engineered to have negative permittivity and negative 
permeability.) When light passes from an ordinary material, into a metamaterial, the 
negative index of refraction causes the light to be bent on the opposite side of the

perpendicular, compared to where it would be bent in an ordinary material. The 
effect is illustrated in Fig. 3.8.
The development of metamaterials makes it possible to design a real-life cloak of 
invisibility. The technology is still in its infancy. Thus far, it is limited to the micro-
wave, or far-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and works well only 
for two-dimensional objects. The limitations have to do with the size of the engi-
neered structures, which must be embedded in the material to make it work. But in 
principle, this technology could be extended to shorter wavelengths (visible spec-
trum) and to three-dimensional objects [35, 36].
A nonmaterial means of cloaking is, of course, used frequently in the various Star 
Trek series. Instead of altering the optical properties of the object, itself, or surrounding 
the object with a cleverly engineered metamaterial cloak, the fabric of spacetime could 
be distorted according to general relativity, in such a way as to bend any electromag-
netic radiation around the object. But this would take us back into Chap. 2. To borrow 
a quote from the original Star Wars movie (Episode IV), we should “move along.”
3.9  Magnetic Materials
In the previous chapter, we met Magneto, one of the lead characters in the X-Men 
movies. Our discussion focused on Newton’s First Law of Motion and the need to 
apply an external force, in order to change the state of motion (or rest) of a system. 
We concluded that Magneto could not move the Golden Gate Bridge, while stand-
ing on the bridge, if he only applied an internal force between himself and the 
ironwork of the bridge. In order to move the combined system (bridge + Magneto), 
he needed an external force, which might be possible if he also interacted with the 
Earth’s magnetic field. Of course, the entire discussion required that we suspend 
disbelief in mutant superpowers and allow that Magneto could (as the story goes) 
“manipulate magnetic fields and metal.”

3.9  Magnetic Materials

Most of the references to Magneto’s powers do not specify the kind of metal that 
he is supposedly able to manipulate. The implication is that he can manipulate all 
metals. But in reality, not all metals exhibit a strong response to magnetic fields. 
Although still not quite right, the reference to Magneto’s powers in X-Men: 
Apocalypse comes a bit closer to reality by limiting the scope of his ability to “the 
magnetic elements: Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt” [37]. It would have been even more 
technically correct if they had said “ferromagnetic,” but that might be asking too 
much of the script for a superhero movie. What happens to a ferromagnetic material, 
such as Iron, Nickel, or Cobalt, in the presence of an external magnetic field? 
Figure 3.9 illustrates some of the possibilities.
In addition to charge and mass, all of the fermions of the Standard Model of Particle 
Physics also have a quantum property called spin, which gives them a magnetic 
moment (imagine them as quantum-size bar magnets). Most of the electrons in an 
atom or molecule will be paired up, with their spins in opposite directions, essentially 
canceling each other out. If the atom or molecule has unpaired electrons, it will have a 
net magnetic moment. This will give it the ability to interact with an external magnetic 
field much more strongly than if all the electrons were paired up. Figure 3.9 is a two-
dimensional model of the atoms in a ferromagnetic material. The individual atoms are 
represented as arrows. In the absence of an external magnetic field (Fig. 3.9a), the 
atoms are arranged in groups called domains. The members of a particular domain all 
have their magnetic moments pointing in the same direction, but the domains them-
selves are oriented at random within the material. The material has no net magnetiza-
tion. In the presence of a sufficiently strong and completely uniform magnetic field 
(Fig. 3.9b), all of the magnetic domains will point in the same direction. If the applied 
field is truly uniform, the material will be magnetized, but there will be no net force on 
the material. In order for the material to experience a force, the applied field must be 
nonuniform. In Fig. 3.9c, the field is strongest at the bottom of the image and decreases 
in strength toward the top of the image. This gradient in the magnetic field produces a 
net force on the material in the downward direction. The material will be pulled toward 
the region of stronger field. The response of the material to the applied magnetic field 
also depends on the temperature. At sufficiently high temperature, called the Curie 
Temperature, thermal vibrations of the system tend to randomize the magnetic

the process reverses. Neglecting air resistance and energy lost as heat in the stretch-
ing springs, the person might bounce forever.
For a more dramatic illustration, we turn to Spider-Man 2, and the scene involv-
ing a runaway elevated train [38]. The throttle of the train is deliberately jammed, 
and the speedometer reads 88 miles per hour (perhaps a tip of the hat to Back to the 
Future?). Spider-Man must use enough webbing, attached to buildings along the 
tracks, to bring the train to a stop. If Spider-Man’s synthetic webbing has properties 
similar to real spider silk, how much webbing does he need to stop the train, before 
it falls off the end of the collapsed tracks several blocks away? The final answer to 
this question will be left as an exercise, but the analysis begins as follows.
In situations where we are dealing with nonrelativistic speeds, the kinetic energy 
of any object can be calculated from the expression
	
K
mv
= 1
2
2,
	
(3.16)
where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity. This expression is appropri-
ate for the runaway train, since it is only traveling at 88 miles per hour. If we assume 
that Spider-Man’s webbing works more or less like an ideal spring, the elastic poten-
tial energy stored in the stretched webbing can be calculated from the expression
	
U
kx
= 1
2
2,
	
(3.17)
where k is the force constant of the webbing and x is the distance of stretch. At the 
point of maximum stretch, when the train finally comes to a stop, all of the original 
kinetic energy of the train has been converted into potential energy stored in the web-
bing, and we can set U = K. (In the movie, the potential energy is not converted back 
into kinetic energy because the first car in the train gets hung up on the edge of col-
lapsed tracks. Otherwise, the train would start to move backwards under the force of 
the webbing.)
Example 3.2: Spider-Man’s Webbing
How much force must Spider-Man exert, by using his webbing, in order to stop the 
runaway train? We can estimate the force constant of Spider-Man’s webbing from 
information in the scene just described. The initial speed of the train is given as 
88 miles per hour. If we do our calculations in the SI system of units, we need to 
convert the speed into meters per second:

The initial kinetic energy of the train is given by Eq. (3.16), but we need an esti-
mate of the mass of the train. Peter Parker/Spider-Man lives in New York City, and 
the runaway train that he stops in the movie is supposed to be a New York MTA 
train. But the movie scene was actually shot in Chicago, using a Chicago L-train as 
a stand-in for the MTA train. According to www.Chicago-L.org, a typical Chicago 
L-train is six cars, each of which weighs 57,000 lb (without passengers). We convert 
this into kilograms:

This is the amount of energy that must be absorbed and converted into potential 
energy in the webbing, according to Eq. (3.17). What we might do next is to calcu-
late the effective force constant, k, for the webbing by solving Eq. (3.17) for k:

In order to do this calculation, we need an estimate of the distance of stretch, x. 
Spider-Man’s first attempt at stopping the train with a single burst of webbing is 
unsuccessful (the webbing breaks). He then shoots multiple strands and manages 
to stop the train approximately 50 s later, just before it falls off the end of the 
tracks. One quick-and-dirty way to estimate how far the train traveled during this 
time is to take the average speed and multiply by the time of travel. The train is 
slowing down during the process, so let’s just take half the initial speed as a reason-
able guess:

Recognizing that the potential energy, U, stored in the webbing is equal to the 
initial kinetic energy, K, of the train, we can now calculate the effective force con-
stant, k, of the combined strands of webbing, in units of Newtons per meter:

So Spider-Man’s webbing (and arms) would have to sustain a force of some-
thing in the neighborhood of 25 Tons! Is this plausible? Some in-depth analysis, 
concerning Spider-Man’s webbing is provided by James Kakalios, in his book, The 
Physics of Superheroes. The treatment is in regard to Spider-Man swinging on his 
webbing, but a fascinating and surprising detail is included. Quoting from an article 
by Jim Robbins, in the July 2002 issue of Smithsonian, he writes, “In theory, a 
braided spider silk rope the diameter of a pencil could stop a fighter jet landing on 
an aircraft carrier” [39].
Could we take our calculation a step further and verify this claim, by comparing 
to actual data for real spider silk? In one of the steps of the above calculation we 
estimated the force constant, k = 240 N/m. The force constant is a property of a 
particular sample of material. But for the purpose of comparison, it would be better 
to calculate the modulus of elasticity (or Young’s modulus), which is a material 
property, rather than a sample-specific property. We can do this as follows:
Young’s modulus is defined as
	
Y = Tensile Stress

3  What Is the Universe Made of? (Matter, Energy, and Interactions)

We can now substitute Eq. (3.18) for the force, F, and recognize the change in 
length, Δl, as equivalent to the amount of stretch of the webbing, x, in Eq. (3.18). 
This gives
	
Y
kl
A
=

(3.19)
Since we already have an estimate of the force constant, k, all we need now are 
estimates of the original length, l, and the cross-sectional area, A, of the webbing. 
For the unstretched length, l, let’s use half the separation between the buildings on 
opposite sides of the elevated railway. A good estimate is l = 20 ft. For the cross-­
sectional area, let’s take a reasonable guess: A = 1 cm2. Substituting all of these into 
Eq. (3.19) and converting to S.I. units gives:

or
	
Y = 14 4. MPa 	
How does this compare to the measured Young’s modulus for actual spider silk? It 
turns out that not all spider silks are created equal. In actual spider web material, there 
is an enormous difference between the elastic properties of the spiral silk compared to 
the radial silk. According to Guo et al., the radial silk is much stiffer and more uni-
form, with a Young’s modulus of about 1.5 GPa. But the spiral silk is much more 
elastic and the Young’s modulus varies from about 5–10 MPa [40]. This suggests that 
the elastic property of Spider-Man’s webbing, as shown in Spider-Man 2, is well 
within the range of values for actual spider silk: just above the high end of the modulus 
of elasticity of the spiral silk but below the measured value for the radial silk. So given 
the favorable comparison, it’s quite plausible that Spider-Man’s webbing could stop 
the runaway train. But given the force required to do the job, his arms might hurt a bit.
3.10.2  Chemical Energy
In our discussion of solid–liquid phase transitions earlier in this chapter, we consid-
ered the problem of using a laser to dump enough energy into solid metal to melt it. 
The laser added energy to the metal, in the form of heat, to increase the amount of 
vibration of the atoms in the solid. If enough heat energy is added, the atoms can be 
made to vibrate beyond the ability of the interatomic bonds to hold the material 
together. The ordered arrangement of atoms in the solid will turn into a disordered 
liquid. This leads naturally to the concept that energy is stored in the bonds between 
3.10  Energy and Power

96
atoms of any material. This energy can be released in chemical reactions, as illus-
trated by the following example.
Example 3.3: Energy in Instant Oatmeal Vs. TNT
Consider half a kilogram of the chemical explosive TNT (trinitrotoluene), com-
pared to a typical 10-packet box of instant oatmeal (my favorite flavor is maple and 
brown sugar). The masses are comparable: 10 packets of instant oatmeal have a total 
mass of just under ½ kilogram. Which of these contains more chemical energy? The 
energy in the oatmeal can be found in the Nutrition Facts, printed on the package. 
Each individual packet is approximately 160 (nutritional) Calories. Using Table 3.6 
to convert nutritional Calories into the SI energy unit of Joules, we get 10 pack-
ets × 160 Calories = 1600 Calories = 6.7 × 106 J or 6.7 MJ. Again using Table 3.6 
(and 1 ton = 1000 kg), we find that ½ kg of TNT is equivalent to roughly 2 MJ. So 
the box of maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal actually contains more energy than a 
comparable mass of TNT!
Estimation 3.5: Energy of a Marathon Runner or a Truck Collision
A typical marathon runner burns roughly 2880 Calories over the course of the race. 
Compare this to the kinetic energy of a large pickup truck (typical mass: 3000 kg) 
traveling at 60 miles per hour. Be sure to express both energies in the same system 
of units. (Convert both of them into joules.)
3.10.3  Distinguishing between Power and Energy
In our discussion of phase transitions, we defined power as energy delivered over a 
certain interval of time, or the rate at which energy is delivered (Eq. 3.9). We can 
use this definition to calculate the power involved in the processes that we just con-
sidered in the previous section.
Example 3.4: Power of TNT Vs. Instant Oatmeal
In the comparison of instant oatmeal with TNT, we found that the oatmeal actually 
contained more chemical energy. But consider now the amount of time required to

release the energy in each case. The time required for the body to metabolize half a 
kilogram of food is something like 8 h. You would probably not want to eat all 10 
packets of instant oatmeal at one sitting, but if you did, the power involved would 
be 6.7 MJ divided by (8 h × 3600 s/h), which comes to about 230 W. Compare this 
to the power involved in exploding the TNT. The actual explosion probably lasts for 
only a fraction of a second, but to keep it simple, let’s assume that it takes 1 s. Using 
Eq. (3.9), the power dissipated in the explosion of ½ kg of TNT is 2 MJ divided by 
1 s, or 2 MW. So even though the oatmeal contains several times more chemical 
energy than the same mass of TNT, the explosion of the TNT corresponds to about 
10,000 times greater power than the process of metabolizing the oatmeal.
Estimation 3.5: Power Dissipated by Marathon Runner or Truck Collision
Consider again the marathon runner and the pickup truck in Estimation 3.4. Suppose 
the pickup truck were to collide head-on with a brick wall. How much power is dis-
sipated in the collision, compared to the power dissipated by the marathon runner 
during the race? Use your energy results from Estimation 3.4 together with reason-
able assumptions about the time for each process (e.g., about 4 h as a typical time to 
run a marathon, and maybe 1 s for the truck collision).
3.10.4  Nuclear Energy
We have just seen that the bonds between atoms in a solid can store considerable 
amounts of energy. The rate at which that energy is released (power) depends on the 
type of chemical reaction. Although the energy per unit mass of some food products 
is somewhat greater than that of TNT, the metabolism of food is a relatively slow 
(low power) process, whereas the explosive release of the energy in TNT is a rela-
tively fast (high power) process. Compared to chemical energy, however, an even 
greater amount of energy is stored, per unit mass, in the nucleus of atoms. An almost 
true-to-life example is shown in the movie True Lies, in which a terrorist group have 
stolen some Soviet nuclear warheads, with intent to use them on selected targets 
within the United States. A spy for a U.S. intelligence service, played by Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, is asked by the leader of the terrorist group if he knows what the 
device is. Initially unwilling to cooperate, the spy responds with sarcasm:
“I know what this is. It’s a snow cone maker. That’s what it is.”
“No, no. It’s an espresso machine. Is it a water heater?”
But when his wife (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is threatened with death, he 
describes the device in considerable detail:
“This is a Soviet MIRV-6 warhead from an SS-22-N launch vehicle. It contains 14.5 
kilograms of enriched uranium… and a yield of 30 kilotons.” [41]
The energy released is the equivalent of 30,000 tons (i.e., 30 million kilograms) 
of TNT. The source of the energy is the splitting of the nucleus of the isotope of

principle, for a machine to become self-aware, or is consciousness something 
unique to highly sophisticated living things? If it is possible, what would it take for 
a computer to become conscious? There is a diversity of views on this question 
among people who work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). At risk of over-
simplifying, we might divide the AI community into two camps: soft AI and hard 
AI. The former might be further subdivided into two subgroups. Some in the soft AI 
camp would say that consciousness is not something that is computable, or that the 
question is not even worth investigating. Others in this group believe that there is no 
fundamental reason why a machine could not become conscious, but that it would 
take a major breakthrough in computer technology to achieve it. Those in the hard 
AI camp are considerably more optimistic. Not only do they believe that machines 
will become conscious, but that it will be achievable with tools and techniques that 
we already have. In other words, it’s just a matter of time.
In this chapter, we will explore some of the developments in the cognitive sci-
ences, a multidisciplinary field, which includes computer science, robotics and arti-
ficial intelligence, as well as cognitive psychology (how do humans think and 
learn?), and neuroscience (how does the brain work?). But before we begin, it may 
be useful to review some of the terminology commonly used to describe the perfor-
mance of computer hardware.
4.1  Information Storage
The storage and retrieval of digital information is not only well understood but has 
advanced at a phenomenal rate over the past several decades, as illustrated by the 
examples in Table 4.1. The table gives storage capacity in units of bytes. A byte is 
the basic unit of digital information storage and is defined to be 8 bits, where a bit 
is simply a one or a zero (the two numbers in the binary counting system). From a 
materials perspective, a one or a zero is stored in a magnetic medium by magnetiz-
ing a small portion of the material either in the up or the down direction, perpen-
dicular to the plane of the disc. The data storage density depends on how easily the

material can be magnetized or demagnetized, and how small the read/write heads of 
the drive can be made.
The first three entries in Table 4.1 are “floppy discs”, so-called because they were 
simply flexible plastic discs, coated with a magnetic film, inside a protective plastic 
jacket. Examples of floppy discs—more properly referred to as “diskettes”—are 
shown in Fig. 4.1. From the time they were introduced c. 1970, until the time they 
became obsolete c. 1990, the storage capacity of these devices had only increased 
by about a factor 5 or 6 (250 kB to 1.44 MB). In contrast, the storage capacity of 
hard discs, from the 1980s to the present, has increased by more than 4 orders of 
magnitude (from 80 MB to 1 TB). As of this writing, you can easily hold a terabyte 
(1012 bytes) of digital information in the palm of your hand, in the form of a portable 
USB hard drive (Fig. 4.2). The last two entries in Table 4.1 are the estimated storage 
capacity of the human brain, at about 2.5 PB [3] and Commander Data’s specifica-
tion of the storage capacity of his “positronic brain” (a term no doubt borrowed 
from Isaac Asimov’s robot novels, which we will consider later in this chapter).
As small and compact as the Terabyte USB hard drive is, it would take the equiv-
alent of about 2500 of them to equal the estimated storage capacity of the human 
brain. If this is state-of-the-art in portable hard data storage, is there any hope of 
ever building a humanoid robot, such as Commander Data, whose intelligence could 
match or exceed that of a human? We may get some perspective on this question by 
considering once again the history of data storage density. When I was an under-
graduate physics major at the University of Pittsburgh, in the mid-1970s, state-of-­
the-art in portable magnetic data storage was the disc pack, a stack of 14″ diameter 
metal platters, roughly 5¼″ high. An example is shown in Fig. 4.3. Each of the 
platters in the stack was coated with a magnetic film for writing the data. The disc 
pack was stored in a protective plastic case, the bottom of which was held in place 
by a spring-clip mechanism, and easily removed before inserting the disc pack into 
Fig. 4.1  Floppy discs. Left to right: 8″ diskette, storage capacity 250 kB; 5.25″ diskette, storage

the read-write drive. The drive itself was larger than a dormitory-size refrigerator. 
After inserting the disc pack into the drive, the top part of the plastic cover was 
removed by rotating the handle. The 1981 James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only 
shows the device in action. Bond, on a visit to Q-branch, loads a disc pack into the 
drive, while Q runs a computer program called the Identi-graph—a face drawing 
and recognition system for identifying known criminals [4].

mental capabilities far exceed those of humans, this result should not come as a sur-
prise. In other words, the script writers of Star Trek: The Next Generation seem to 
have got this one right. But what about his processor speed, which Data specified to 
be “60 trillion operations per second”? How does this specification compare to the 
estimated speed of the human brain and to state-of-the-art computers in the twenty-
first century? We will take up that question in sections to follow. But first, a brief look 
at some calculating devices that were common in the early part of the twentieth cen-
tury and what the term “computer” originally meant at that time in history.

4.2  Analog Calculating Devices
The 1961 movie Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea might be thought of as a modern 
take on the 1870 Jules Verne novel, “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea”. Renowned 
scientist and retired naval officer Admiral Harriman Nelson (played by Walter 
Pidgeon) is the designer of a futuristic nuclear submarine, the Seaview. Although 
computer technology is an important part of the submarine’s design, we never really 
see this technology in action in the movie. Admiral Nelson is faced with a scientific 
and technological problem of truly global proportion (one which we will revisit in a 
later chapter). The urgency and complexity of this problem cry out for a computer 
to solve it, yet Admiral Nelson does his calculations on a slide rule [5]. In the con-
text of the times, this has some truth to it, but is also misleading. NASA’s Apollo 
moon missions would not have been possible without onboard computers, yet the 
NASA engineers and astronauts still used slide rules to do their everyday calcula-
tions (Fig. 4.5). On the other hand, even in the early 1960s, complex calculations of 
the sort that Admiral Nelson was doing in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, or of the 
sort required by NASA to land humans safely on the moon, would have been done 
not on a slide rule, but with the aid of significantly more sophisticated devices, with 
much higher precision.

Space does not permit a detailed history of the major advances in computer proces-
sor technology, but a good overview is provided in the October 1996 Special Issue 
of Physics Today (50 Years of Computers and Physicists), particularly the article by 
Alfred E. Brenner, entitled “The Computing Revolution and the Physics Community” 
[14]. A good summary plot illustrating Moore’s Law has been created by Wgsimon 
and is reproduced in Fig. 4.6.
A significant development in the history of computing came in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, with the introduction of personal computers. Prior to this time, comput-
ers were large, expensive devices, which occupied an entire room—or at least sig-
nificant portions of a room—and were beyond the means of individuals. The Apple 
II (1978), followed soon after by the IBM-PC (1981), made computing affordable 
and accessible to the general public. But the user interface for these new desktop 
computers was still basically the same as for the big mainframe computers: com-
mands were typed on a keyboard. The next step forward came with the introduction 
to the consumer market of the mouse and the graphical user interface (or GUI) by 
Apple, in 1984. Although not the first company to offer a computer with a mouse

and GUI, Apple was the first to make the cost (at just under $2500) affordable to the 
consumer. The true honor of “first” computer to be similarly equipped actually 
belongs to the Xerox Alto. But its $40K price tag put it out of reach of the typical 
user. The Macintosh was released in January of 1984 and promoted with the famous 
television commercial, first aired during Super Bowl XVIII, proclaiming that “1984 
will not be like “1984”.” The reference was to the George Orwell science fiction 
novel, “1984”, which depicted a future totalitarian society, in which “Big Brother” 
was always watching [16].
This major turn of events in the computing world is illustrated in a sci-fi movie 
scene, which we have already discussed in Chap. 3. In Star Trek IV: The Voyage 
Home, Scotty from the original Star Trek series produced an animated image of the 
molecular structure of transparent aluminum on a Macintosh computer. Released in 
1985, Star Trek IV is one of the better examples of sci-fi movies, which not only 
feature state-of-the-art in real-life technology, but also make accurate predictions of 
future technology [17]. Recall Scotty’s unsuccessful attempt to get the attention of 
the Macintosh simply by speaking the word “computer.” He then picks up the mouse 
and says “Hello, computer” into the bottom of the mouse, but still no response 
(Fig. 4.7). Even the most advanced personal computers of the mid-1980s were inca-
pable of responding to voice commands. But now, smart phones come equipped 
with speech recognition. A user can find information about transparent aluminum 
simply by speaking the words to the smart phone’s Internet search engine.
Three years after the release of Macintosh by Apple, IBM released their PS-2, 
which was my first desktop computer. Its processor speed was 20 MHz, which was 
almost 1000 times faster than the speed of the IBM 7090, featured in Hidden 
Figures.

user interface (GUI) and a mouse at an affordable price. It did not, however, respond to voice com-

creator, Jackson Roykirk. Fortunately for the Enterprise and her crew, any command 
given to Nomad by “the Kirk—the Creator” was obeyed without question, provided 
it was within Nomad’s capability.
While onboard the Enterprise, Nomad hears Lt. Uhura singing and wants to 
know what form of communication she is using. When Uhura is unable to explain 
the purpose of singing to Nomad’s satisfaction, it absorbs all of the information in 
her brain and erases her memory. Chief Engineer Scott rushes to Uhura’s defense 
but is instantly killed by a burst of energy from Nomad. At Kirk’s request, Nomad 
is able to restore Scotty to life. Unfortunately, Nomad cannot restore Uhura’s mem-
ory, and she is faced with the daunting task of relearning everything she knew [33].
Spock faces a similar challenge at the beginning of Star Trek IV: The Voyage 
Home. Having sacrificed his life to save the crew of the starship Enterprise in Star 
Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and having his body regenerated on the Genesis planet, 
in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, he must reacquire all of his Vulcan knowl-
edge, prior to returning to Earth to give testimony at a court martial [34]. The 
retraining of Uhura and Spock occurs at a remarkable pace, both of them relearning 
most of what they knew in a matter of days.
As we have already seen, the advent of machine learning has revitalized the field 
of artificial intelligence. Almost certainly, the creation of artificial consciousness (if, 
indeed, it is even possible) will be more than just a matter of data storage capacity 
and processing speed. Understanding the details of how the human brain stores and 
processes information will also be needed. Thanks to the development of functional

features numerous Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animations, a tedious and time-­
consuming method of creating special effects, before computers became sophisti-
cated enough to do the job. Talos begins as a statue on a pedestal and is not very 
much larger than a human. But when he detects the presence of the intruders, he 
becomes an animated being, which appears to grow larger and larger as the scene 
progresses. Eventually, Talos is large enough to pick up a sailing vessel and dump 
its passengers out into the water. But he has a literal Achilles heel. He is filled with 
some sort of magical fluid, which can be drained out through a screw-cap in his 
heel. After a prolonged struggle, which includes some human fatalities, Jason suc-
ceeds in unscrewing the cap, whereupon the fluid drains out. The bronze giant 
clutches his throat, as though gasping for breath. His body begins to crack, and he 
falls to his demise on the beach.
Is Talos a robot, in the modern sense of the word? Yes, and even more so. Talos 
would qualify as an example of an intelligent robot—an artificial entity which com-
bines the three key elements of sensor, computation, and control (Table  4.3). 
Sensors are the means by which a robot gathers information from the environment. 
They can be as simple as a temperature probe, or as sophisticated as a visual imag-
ing system. Computation is the means by which the robot analyzes the information 
and makes decisions based on the sensory input. This could be as simple as a logic 
circuit, which gives a yes/no answer to the question “Should I do something?” or as 
complex as a speech recognition algorithm, which can compute responses based on 
verbal commands. Finally, control is the resulting manipulation of the environment. 
Talos is a mechanical device, which combines all three of these essential elements. 
He is immobile until he becomes aware of the presence of human intruders, 
­presumably by visual input. He recognizes the humans as a threat to the security of 
the island, presumably via some pattern-recognition system, which would ignore 
the indigenous animal life. He controls the environment by stepping into action, and 
using his sword and physical strength to ward off the intruders.
Science fiction stories often imagine scenarios in which things go badly wrong, 
and robots out of control is a common theme. Among the very best of this particular 
subgenre is 2001: A Space Odyssey, which we have already considered in the context 
of our discussion of moving and rotating reference frames. One of the main characters 
in the movie is the HAL-9000, which self-identifies as a computer. Nevertheless, HAL 
meets all of the criteria for being an intelligent robot, as summarized in Table 4.3. It is 
described in a BBC television interview, during a spaceflight to Jupiter, as the brain 
and central nervous system of the interplanetary spaceship, Discovery I. It has sensors

absolutely foolproof, with no chance of Frank getting caught or coming to harm. 
During the casing part of the process, in which Frank carefully observes the intended 
victim’s home, Robot and Frank engage in a philosophical conversation about self-­
awareness. Frank questions Robot about an interaction, which suggests there’s more 
to Robot than just his programming:
FRANK: What about when you said that I had to eat healthy, because you didn’t want your 
memory erased? You know, I think there’s something more going on in that noggin of yours.
ROBOT: I only said that to coerce you.
FRANK: You lied?
ROBOT: Your health supersedes my other directives. The truth is, I don’t care if my mem-
ory is erased or not.
FRANK: But how can you not care about something like that?
ROBOT: Think about it this way: You know that you are alive—you think, therefore, you 
are.
FRANK: That’s philosophy.
ROBOT: In a similar way, I know that I’m not alive. I’m a robot.
FRANK: I don’t want to talk about how you don’t exist. It’s making me uncomfortable. [48]
Frank’s wellbeing is Robot’s highest directive. He is even programmed to lie, if 
necessary, to make sure that Frank takes care of himself. Robot’s ability to lie 
strongly suggests that he could pass the Turing Test and deceive a human interroga-
tor into believing that he is human. But the philosophical interaction with Frank also 
suggests that Robot is aware of his own existence. Not only is he programmed with 
a specific purpose. He KNOWS what he is and that he has a purpose. This brings us 
to our next topic.
4.8  Toward the Creation of Artificial Consciousness
PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network) is a sentient artificial intelligence, 
built on state-of-the-art quantum processors, in the movie Transcendence. In the 
aftermath of a violent attack by antitechnology terrorists, PINN is questioned by 
government scientist, Dr. Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman):
TAGGER: PINN, can you prove that you are self-aware?
PINN: That’s a difficult question, Dr. Tagger. Can you prove that you are? [49]
What does it mean for a living creature to be self-aware? Is consciousness comput-
able? That is to say, can we program a machine to be self-aware? Or is conscious-
ness an emergent property of a sufficiently complex system, either biological or 
artificial? These questions have not yet been answered and are the subject of ongo-
ing research.
Neurobiologists Christoph Koch and Giulio Tononi have become interested in 
the question of machine consciousness from the point of view of how the human 
brain gives rise to subjective experience. They have proposed what they refer to as 
the integrated information theory of consciousness, based upon two axioms. First, 
that a particular conscious state rules out a huge number of other possible states (it 
is highly informative), and second, that a conscious state exists as a complex, inte-

5.3  Searching for Signs of Extraterrestrial Intelligence
A second issue presented in the early scenes of Alien is the kind of evidence which 
might suggest intelligent life. The radio signal intercepted by the Nostromo’s com-
puter repeated at regular intervals and was broadcast at a very well-defined fre-
quency. This is consistent with the expected characteristics of an artificially 
generated transmission, as described by Tim Folger in his article “Contact: the Day 
After” in the January 2011 issue of Scientific American [12]. There are naturally 
occurring sources of radio emission, known as pulsars, which are also periodic, but 
radiate over a broader range of frequencies. Any radio signal which is confined to a 
narrow band is much more likely to be of intelligent origin.
5.3.1  The Drake Equation and the SETI Project
The possibility of radio communication with civilizations on other planets was con-
ceived almost concurrent with the invention of radio. In 1919, Guglielmo Marconi 
observed radio signals which seemed to be coming from Mars [13]. But the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence, as an experimental endeavor, began in the mid-­
twentieth century. In a paper published in 1959, in the journal Nature, Giuseppe 
Cocconi and Philip Morrison proposed the use of radio telescopes to listen for pos-
sible extraterrestrial transmissions. Working independently, Frank Drake began the 
first search of this type in 1960 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, in 
Green Bank, West Virginia. The first serious SETI conference (Search for 
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) was held at Green Bank the following year. One of the 
outcomes of this conference was an estimate of the number of civilizations in our 
galaxy capable of radio communication, calculated according to the famous Drake 
Equation:
	
N
R f n f f f L
=
∗·
·
· · ·
·
p
e
l

c
. 	
(5.1)
The parameters in Eq. (5.1) are defined as follows:
•	 R∗ is the average rate at which stars are formed in the galaxy.
•	 fp is the fraction of stars with planets.
•	 ne is the number of Earth-type planets per star system.
•	 fl is the fraction of Earth-type planets with life.
•	 fi is the fraction of life-sustaining planets with intelligent life.
•	 fc is the fraction of intelligent civilizations capable of radio communication.
•	 L is the average lifetime of radiocommunicating civilizations.
Among the attendees at the first SETI conference was Carl Sagan, who provided 
a detailed description of the parameters in the Drake Equation, as well as the 
assumptions made about each parameter, in a book coauthored with I.S. Shklovskii 
[14]. At the time of the first SETI conference, the only parameter in Eq. (5.1) which

intensity measured over time revealed periodic dips of as much as 20%. In contrast, 
typical transit events involve dips of about 1%, caused by planets about the size of 
Jupiter. Various hypotheses were proposed to account for the unusually large inten-
sity dips, ranging from the tail of a gigantic comet, of a size never before seen, to 
alien megastructures [18]. The Kepler Telescope only measure intensity of white 
light (all wavelengths of the visible spectrum simultaneously). In order to interpret 
the anomalous observations, additional observations had to be made at different 
wavelengths. These studies revealed that the dips in intensity were greater in the 
short-wavelength part of the spectrum, which would suggest the presence of clouds 
of dust. After several years of study, the most likely explanation seems to be a com-
bination of orbiting gas and asteroids [19].
5.5  Conditions Necessary for Intelligent Life to Arise
The third question prompted by the early scenes in Alien is that of the conditions, 
which seem to be necessary for intelligent life to exist anywhere in the universe. One 
of the most obvious conditions for the existence of intelligent life—in fact, the guiding 
principle for NASA’s Kepler mission—is the existence of a habitable planet. Intelligent 
life (at least as we know it) requires an environment with water and a breathable atmo-
sphere. The planet must be large enough to sustain an atmosphere, and just warm 
enough to have liquid water. This sets limits on the size and temperature of the star, 
and the distance at which the planet orbits the star. In addition to having the right 
temperature range, if complex life began on Earth in tidal pools, as is commonly

the Harding-Cox presidential election, on November 2, 1920. Thus, in order to 
know of our existence by detecting radio transmissions, an intelligent civilization 
would have to be no farther away than about 90–100 light years. Any farther away 
and our radio signals would not yet have arrived.
Returning to the movie Contact, and skipping ahead a few scenes, we find the 
lead character, Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), admiring what was, until very 
recently, the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world, at Arecibo, Puerto Rico 
(Fig. 5.2). The Arecibo radio dish is 305 m in diameter and built into the ground, 
with a moveable receiver that allows it to gather radio waves from a limited area of 
the sky overhead. Dr. Arroway plans to use her precious telescope time to search for 
“little green men.” In other words, she hopes to find evidence of radio transmission 
from an extraterrestrial civilization [27].
Construction of the radio telescope at Arecibo began in 1960, the same year as 
the first SETI conference. In 1974 the facility made history by broadcasting the 
most powerful radio signal into space, designed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, 
with information about human life on Earth. The intent was to let other intelligent, 
radio-communicating civilizations know that we exist [28].
Numerous websites still claim that Arecibo is the largest single-aperture radio 
telescope in the world, but you have to be careful what you read. In 2016, China 
completed the construction of an even larger one. The 500-m Aperture Spherical 
Telescope (or FAST), built in Guizhou Province, will be used to search for signs of 
intelligent life in the universe (among other things) [29].

a living human creature, which he assembled from pieces of dead bodies. Without 
going into any technical details, the third chapter of the 1818 text is Frankenstein’s 
first-person account of numerous successes and failures, leading up to his ultimate 
goal. Again with no scientific details, Chap. 4 begins thus:
It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an 
anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me that I 
might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in 
the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt 
out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the 
creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. [1]
Undoubtedly, the most famous screen adaptation of the Frankenstein story is the 
original 1931 movie, starring Boris Karloff as the monster and Colin Clive as Dr. 
Frankenstein. The dreary scene from the fourth chapter of the novel is transformed 
from one in which Frankenstein and his newly created monster are the only partici-
pants, into a dramatic spectacle, witnessed by a lab assistant and three unexpected 
visitors. Frankenstein’s fiancée, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his former university pro-
fessor, Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), and his future brother-in-law (John Boles) 
arrive during a violent thunderstorm. Frankenstein reluctantly lets them in, if only 
to provide shelter from the storm, and then the leads them up to his laboratory. 
Instead of the simple words from the novel, “the instruments of life,” which leave 
much to the imagination, we are presented in the movie with a room filled with 
impressive-looking machinery, and a body on an operating table, covered with a 
sheet. Insisting that the visitors all sit down and observe from a safe distance, 
Frankenstein proceeds to explain the bizarre nature of his experiments.
FRANKENSTEIN: Dr. Waldman, I learned a great deal from you at the university about the 
violet ray—the ultraviolet ray—which you said was the highest color in the spectrum. But 
you were wrong. Here in this machinery I have gone beyond that. I have discovered the 
great ray that first brought life into the world.
WALDMAN: Oh. And your proof?
FRANKENSTEIN: Tonight you shall have your proof. At first I experimented only with 
dead animals and then a human heart, which I kept beating for 3 weeks. But now, I am going 
to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.
WALDMAN: And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
FRANKENSTEIN: That body is not dead. It has never lived. I created it. I made it with my 
own hands, from bodies that I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere. Go and see 
for yourself.
Dr. Waldman is allowed to examine the body and confirms that it is dead. Frankenstein and 
his assistant proceed with the final experiment. The array of electrical equipment is energized 
and begins to produce lots of flashes and high-voltage sparks. The operating table is hoisted 
to the roof, where the body is exposed to the full fury of the lightning storm. When Frankenstein 
decides that sufficient time has passed, the body is lowered again, and he examines the result. 
From underneath the sheet, the right hand of the monster begins to move.
FRANKENSTEIN: (at first in a hushed tone) Look! It’s moving. It’s alive. (and then shout-
ing) It’s Alive! It’s Alive! In the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God! [2]
Frankenstein realized his dream of being the first to create human life by artificial 
means. But as in the novel, the consequences were disastrous. The story continues

entire population of the planet. If you start with two infected people and square the 
number 30 times, instead of simply doubling the number (the true meaning of 
R0 = 2), the result would be astronomical.
How does the infectious disease in Contagion compare to real infectious diseases 
in the news in recent years? A close comparison is the 2014 outbreak of the Ebola 
virus in West Africa, which was estimated to have an R0 between 1.5 and 2.5 [22]. 
In contrast, the measles virus is widely reported to have an R0 in the range 12–18. 
But a recent publication in the journal, The Lancet, suggests that the range of values 
may actually be much broader than this, depending on the locality [23]. Why the 
broad range for measles and the comparatively narrow range for Ebola? A partial 
answer to this question is that R0 is not a universal constant for a particular disease. 
It depends upon other factors, such as population density and mobility of the 
infected people. The data for measles have been gathered from all over the world at 
various times and places, while the value reported for Ebola was specific to the 2014 
outbreak in West Africa.
A second important question, comparing Ebola and measles, is why should the 
average value of R0 for measles be so much greater than for Ebola? A partial answer 
to this question has to do with the way in which the disease is transmitted. The measles 
virus is airborne, while Ebola requires direct contact with bodily fluids of the infected 
patient. The relative ease of transmission tends to make the value of R0 larger. But the 
mystery virus in Contagion was also supposed to have been airborne, so shouldn’t it 
have a value of R0 closer to that of the measles virus? Or another way of putting it, if 
the measles virus has an R0 of at least 10, why the global panic in Contagion, includ-

is registered as a particle count. The higher the intensity of the radiation, the more 
frequently counts will be registered by the instrument. But the way in which the 
Geiger counter is portrayed in The War of the Worlds is inaccurate on several counts. 
First, the emission and detection of radiation are completely random processes. The 
clicking of the Geiger counter would be random, and not “ticking like a bomb.” 
Second, the particle detection exhibits directionality, which would not be possible 
for radiation that could travel several meters from the source to the detector. These 
would have to be gamma rays, and they would not care which way the probe of the 
detector is turned, as long as the distance from the probe to the source is not changed 
significantly. Finally, if there had been some directionality, it would have been 
exactly the opposite of what we see in the movie. Figure 6.1 shows two of several 
possible designs for Geiger counters. A contemporary radiation survey meter, with 
an end-window, is shown in Fig. 6.1a. The Geiger counter used in The War of the 
Worlds is similar to the design shown in Fig. 6.1b. The sensitive window of the 
detector, designed for beta particles, is on the side of the probe, not on the end. Yet 
we saw an increased count rate when the end of the probe was turned toward 
the source.
6.4.2  Biological Effects of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation
A crucial issue raised in this scene is the level of radiation exposure. Is the observed 
radiation count rate really high enough to warrant posting deputies to keep people 
away from the fallen radioactive object? Radiation interacts with biological tissue in 
much the same way that it interacts with the gas in a Geiger tube: ionization. When 
a gamma ray passes through the skin, or deeper into the body, it will ionize biologi-
cal molecules and break interatomic bonds at random. The human body has the 
remarkable ability to heal itself from small amounts of damage. But if enough 
­damage is done, the natural healing process may not be able to keep up, and vital

systems begin to shut down. At what level does radiation exposure become danger-
ous, and how much exposure is needed to kill a human (or a Vulcan, as in Star Trek 
II)? Table 6.2 is a summary of radiation doses, in units if Sieverts (Sv) and the 
resulting biological effects.
The worst nuclear disaster in human history occurred on April 26, 1986, when the 
reactor at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, exploded, and the core suffered meltdown. Many of 
the workers who cleaned up the radioactive debris in the immediate vicinity of the 
reactor received a lethal dose of radiation. For comparison, the safety standard for 
radiation workers in the United States is set at 0.05 Sv per calendar year, which is five 
times lower than the threshold of 0.25 Sv, below which there are no easily detectable 
biological effects. Radiation exposure to individuals can be monitored with various 
types of personal dosimetry, as shown in Fig. 6.2. The materials in the whole-body 
badge and finger rings record the amount of ionization produced. The dosimetry is 
analyzed periodically, to ensure that the radiation dose received is below acceptable 
limits. For more information on radiation doses from various sources, see the highly 
detailed chart compiled by Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd comics [27].
Radiation safety is a serious business, which the 2000 remake of Godzilla takes far 
too lightly. Early in the movie, a biologist is seen studying the effect of radiation on 
worms, near Chernobyl, in the aftermath of the worst nuclear disaster in history [28].
From a safety perspective, the scene is completely absurd. As explained in the 
introduction to the “Radioactive Wolves” episode of the PBS Nature series, the 
Chernobyl disaster resulted in the release of radiation equivalent to roughly 400 
Hiroshima bombs. Now, more than 30 years later, an exclusion zone of roughly 
1100 miles around the defunct nuclear reactor continues to be unsafe for human 
habitation. The radioactive particles are in the soil, and have been absorbed into 
plant life, and concentrated in the bones and organs of the animal life, which moved 
into the zone after the humans fled. Nobody can enter the exclusion zone without an 
official escort, and nobody who knows anything about the hazards of radiation 
would be digging in the soil, as the lead character does in Godzilla, without protec-
tive clothing and a face mask, to prevent breathing the radioactive fallout [29].
Finally, a sci-fi example of the effects of radiation on biological tissue, which 
defies probability, is the giant ants in the movie Them. According to the script, fall-
out from nuclear testing in the New Mexico desert causes aunts to grow to the size 
of horses [30]. This is completely implausible, both from the perspective of genetic 
mutations, and from the perspective of structural mechanics. One of the possible 
consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation is the development of cancer cells.

6.4  Cell Structure and Radiation Damage

180
Instead of completely killing a cell by disrupting critical components, it is possible 
for the radiation to alter the genetic material of the cell in a way that leads to abnor-
mal growth and multiplication out of control. But there is no possible mechanism to 
trigger uniform growth of all of the tissues of the body, in such a way that the entire 
organism grows to hundreds of times its normal size. Just to illustrate the complex-
ity of the problem, there are dozens of genes in the human body which are involved 
in determining the height of an individual. Each of them contributes in a subtle way 
to the growth process. Assuming that the growth process in ants is governed by a 
similar combination of genes, it is unimaginable that exposure to radiation would 
alter all of the necessary genes in just the right way to cause abnormally large, but 
uniform growth, without being fatal to the organism. And even if this were possible, 
the structural elements of the ant’s body would not be able to support the weight. 
The weight of the ant’s body is roughly proportional to its total volume, which 
increases approximately as the cube of the linear dimension. But the strength of the 
ant’s legs is related to the cross-sectional area of its exoskeleton. This would increase 
approximately as the square of the linear dimension, if the growth were uniform.
Despite the completely implausible science, Them is noteworthy for having a 
very strong female scientist in a leading role—something which is not typical of 
1950s movies. Joan Weldon plays Dr. Patricia Medford, an accomplished scientist 
in her own right, and the daughter of Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn), the 
world’s leading expert on ants. Throughout the movie, the younger Dr. Medford 
demonstrates greater presence of mind than her famous father, and in the end, more 
bravery than most of the male characters in the film.
Most of what we know about the biological effects of ionizing radiation on 
humans, including the information summarized in Table 6.2, is derived from the 
so-­called Life Span Study, a long-term study of the survivors of the Hiroshima/
Nagasaki atomic bombs. Prior to the Chernobyl disaster of April 1986, almost noth-
ing was known about the effects of radiation on plant and animal life. Following 
Chernobyl, and more recently, the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant in March of 2011, studies are being done on the long-term effects of 
radiation on the surrounding ecosystems. Although the amount of radiation released

By comparing Tables 6.3 and 6.4, you can get an idea of the danger. UV-C clearly 
spans the range of energies sufficient to ionize any of these important biological 
molecules. According to information available from the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC), UV-C radiation is very dangerous. Fortunately, the Earth’s ozone layer does 
a good job of filtering out the naturally occurring UV-C radiation from the Sun. But 
artificial sources of UV-C radiation, such as those marketed to kill bacteria on the 
surfaces of household objects, and Mercury vapor lamps, are potentially dangerous, 
and should be used with caution. Most but not all of the UV-B radiation is filtered 
out by the atmosphere along with the UV-C, but there is still cause for concern. 
UV-A radiation, which is the most abundant range of UV wavelengths at the Earth’s 
surface, appears to be below the threshold for directly ionizing the base molecules 
in RNA and DNA, at least according to the theoretical calculations. Nevertheless, 
this range of UV wavelengths has been directly linked to skin cancer.
So the precise mechanism of radiation-induced cancer is probably not as simple 
as ionizing the bases of RNA or DNA. The empirical evidence linking UV-A to skin 
cancer strongly suggests taking appropriate precautions against overexposure to 
the Sun.
6.5  DNA and the Human Genome
The “Island of Dr. Moreau”, published by H.G. Wells in 1896, tells the story of a 
shipwreck survivor, who is taken to an unnamed island, where he becomes a witness 
to bizarre biological experiments. Animals of various kinds are gradually being 
altered to look like humans. Over the hundred years following the publication of the 
novel, a number of film versions were made, which illustrate how advances in sci-
ence can influence the way in which a classic story is told. The earliest talking ver-
sion, The Island of Lost Souls, features Charles Laughton in the role of Dr. Moreau. 
Released in 1932, it describes the transformation of animals into human-like

­creatures in the same way that the book does, as a purely surgical technique. By the 
middle of the twentieth century, the molecular basis of heredity and the structure of 
DNA had been discovered. This had a progressive impact on two subsequent screen 
versions of the story, both of which bear the same title as the book. The 1977 ver-
sion, starring Burt Lancaster in the title role, and Michael York as Andrew Braddock, 
the shipwreck survivor, portrays the transformation procedure as a combination of 
surgery and genetic manipulation.
When the survivor of the shipwreck discovers the laboratory and the gruesome 
experiments in progress, Doctor Moreau offers the following explanation.
MOREAU: I have proved—almost proved—the existence of a cell particle that controls the 
living organism. This cell, this particle, controls the shape of life.
(Holding up a large syringe…)
This serum contains a distillation of a biological code message: a new set of 
instructions for erasing the natural instincts of this animal. With some surgery, 
implants into various organs, he should grow to resemble any creature I 
please—in this case, a human being.
(He injects the creature, and it begins to writhe in agony.)
See. The serum is already forcing a modification of the body.
BRADDOCK: But why do you do this? For what possible reason?
MOREAU: Why? To reach for the control of heredity. Think what it can do for humanity: 
the pain we can ease; the deformities we can avoid. The possibilities are end-
less. [33]
Although he was at least partially motivated by good intentions (easing pain and 
avoiding deformities), the methods used by the 1977 version of Doctor Moreau 
involved great pain for his animal subjects. This raises an ethical question: do the 
ends justify the means?
The 1996 version of The Island of Doctor Moreau, with Marlon Brando in the 
title role, makes no mention of surgery. In this version of the story, the transforma-
tion from animal to human is entirely a matter of genetic engineering, or what might 
be described more precisely as gene therapy.
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the complex biological molecule, which con-
tains the blueprint for a particular biological organism. The overall structure of 
DNA is a double-helix of alternating sugar and peptide molecules, as illustrated in 
Fig. 6.3. The base pairs, guanine and cytosine, or thymine and adenine, form the 
rungs of the twisted ladder-like shape. Alterations to the composition of this mole-
cule can have devastating consequences for the organism, itself, or to its offspring, 
or may have no noticeable effects, whatsoever, depending upon which specific 
details are changed.
The publicly funded Human Genome Project began in 1990, with a primary goal 
to map the entire human DNA sequence within 15 years. Under pressure from pri-
vate sector competition, the project was completed in 2003 [34]. The first director 
of this ambitious initiative was James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of 
DNA. But Watson resigned after only 2 years, following an argument with the direc-
tor of the National Institutes of Health, over the wisdom of patenting segments of 
DNA, a practice to which Watson was strongly opposed. He was succeeded by 
Francis Collins, who led the project to completion [35].
6.5  DNA and the Human Genome

184
The entire human genome consists of 3.1 billion base pairs [36]. At first reading, 
it seemed that only about 1.5% of these base pairs, making up a mere 20,000–25,000 
genes, were actually involved in the life-sustaining process of coding for proteins. 
The rest was referred to by some researchers as “junk DNA”—long stretches of 
base pairs in between the identifiable genes, which had no apparent function. Taking 
a more humble approach to the interpretation of the data, Collins dismissed this 
pejorative label as nothing but hubris, given our level of ignorance at the time [37]. 
The analysis of the data is ongoing, but a recent breakthrough vindicates Collins. 
The results of the ENCODE project (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), published in 
2012, largely dispel the previously held notion of “junk DNA” and suggest that at

from bullets, and gold coins, none of which would be attracted to an ordinary mag-
net. The force which it exerts cannot arise from any known physical interaction, 
hence its appeal to the Soviet researcher [19].
It is an unfortunate truth that both Soviet and American scientists in the Cold War 
era were seriously interested in psychic phenomena. A faculty member at my under-
graduate institution even taught a course on the subject (enrollment was by special 
permission, which required a personal interview with the professor), conducted his 
own research, and published papers in the field. Some of the researchers were so 
determined to prove that such things exist that they postulated a phenomenon called 
psi-missing to explain away the negative results. Although written in a rather 
­different context, the words of Howard Van Till, Davis Young, and Clarence 
Menninga are equally applicable to psychic research:
The purpose of empirical research is to discover what the physical world is really like, not 
to verify its conformity to our preferences. And the aim of scientific theorizing is to describe 
the actual character of the universe, not to force its compliance with our preconceived 
requirements…. When the epistemic goal of gaining knowledge is replaced with the dog-
matic goal of providing warrant for one’s personal belief system, the superficial activity that 
remains may no longer be called natural science. It may be termed world-view warranting 
or creed confirmation, but it no longer deserves the label of natural science because it is no 
longer capable of giving birth to knowledge. Science held hostage by extrascientific dogma 
is science made barren. [20]
Earlier in this chapter, we considered the actions of the scientist in Woman in the 
Moon as an illustration of the scientific method at work. Having done some real sci-
ence, he then crosses over into the realm of pseudoscience. Obsessed with a desire 
to find gold on the Moon, he takes out a divining rod from his belt and uses this 
pseudoscientific device to guide him in his quest for wealth. He is ultimately suc-
cessful in his quest but could the divining rod have had anything to do with it? 
Divining rods are supposed to enable the user to find hidden sources of water, oil, 
and other things limited only by the imagination but are not based on any kind of 
real science. James “The Amazing” Randi, a stage magician, turned debunker of 
alleged psychic phenomena, designed a controlled experimental test, involving a 
network of underground pipes, and valves that can be opened at random, which 
would unambiguously prove or disprove the validity of divining rods as a means of 
finding water underground. A $1 million prize was offered for many years by the 
James Randi Educational Foundation to anyone who could successfully demon-
strate any so-called psychic powers, including, but not limited to, any “diviner” who 
could pass the buried water pipe test. During the years in which the prize was 
offered, nobody ever succeeded in meeting the challenge. With the retirement of 
James Randi in 2015, the Foundation shifted its attention to annual awards, “given 
to the person or organization that best represents the spirit of the foundation by 
encouraging critical questions and seeking unbiased, fact-based answers” [21]. If 
psychic phenomena are real, someone surely would have applied for and won the 
Amazing Randi’s $1 million Psychic Challenge prize, long before it was 
discontinued.

“30X” means. The “X” is a standard homeopathic symbol, which refers to a dilution 
by a factor of 10. (Some homeopathic medicines have the designation “C” which 
means a dilution by a factor of 100.) The “30” indicates that 30 successive dilutions 
have been performed. So “30X” means that the initial product has undergone 30 
dilutions, by a factor of 10 each time. The final product has a concentration which 
is reduced by a factor of 1030 compared to the initial concentration. So how much of 
the active ingredient is left in the end? Let’s do the math.
The bottle in Fig. 7.1 contains 148 pills, with a total mass of 9.6 g. The highest 
possible concentration is 100% pure active ingredient. So the maximum number of 
Helenalin molecules that could conceivably be in this bottle of pills can be calcu-
lated by dividing the total mass of the pills by the molar mass of Helenalin and then 
multiplying that result by Avogadro’s number, to convert from moles to molecules:

crate of experimental radioactive vegetable seeds washes up on shore. The title 
character finds the crate, but fails to notice the warning on the cover before open-
ing it. The castaways plant the seeds, harvest the abnormal-looking crop and pro-
ceed to eat the vegetables. Soon afterward, they begin to manifest extraordinary 
powers. Super-­acute vision results from eating the carrots, super-strength from 
spinach, and hyperactivity from eating sugar beets. The warning on the lid of the 
crate is discovered after the fact, and the Professor offers a scientific-sounding 
explanation. The natural nutritional value of the vegetables must have been 
enhanced by the radioactivity [33]. This, of course, is silliness. But the exposure 
of plant seeds to gamma radiation, and their release to the public, is a matter of 
fact. In the mid-twentieth century, in an effort to gain insight into the biological 
effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, various kinds of flower seeds were 
exposed to gamma ray, and sold in stores as “Atomic Activated.” The package, 
shown in Fig. 7.2, invites the consumer to “Plant your own experimental garden 
with atomic activated seeds.”

arterial blood. But there is another possible interpretation. The alkali metals are the 
elements in column I of the periodic table, which includes Lithium, Sodium, 
Potassium, etc. Foods that are high in Sodium typically have lots of added salt 
(Sodium Chloride).
The claim that New Era Potato Chips are “partially starch-dextrinized and there-
fore more readily digested than fresh raw potatoes” is also a true statement. Potatoes 
have lots of starch. Starch is a long polymer hydrocarbon molecule, which breaks 
down into shorter hydrocarbon chains, called dextrins, when exposed to heat. The 
shorter chains do, indeed, make the product more readily digestible. But are these 
potato chips really “scientifically processed”, as it says on the can? No! They’ve 
been cooked and salted. There is actually evidence that the discovery of cooked 
food early in human history may have had a beneficial effect on the development of 
the human brain [36]. One could argue that cooking is a science. But to promote 
potato chips as being “scientifically processed” when in fact they have simply been 
cooked and salted, is to misuse science for the purpose of deception.

7.6.4  Does a Cleansing Solution Work Better If It Contains 
Micelles?
A number of products have come on the market recently, for the purpose of remov-
ing dirt and makeup from the skin. They are presumably easier and more convenient 
to use than old-school cold creams or the somewhat more modern cleansing creams. 
They are marketed by various companies and go by various names, but most of 
them include the scientific-sounding word “micellar” in the names of their products. 
The advertisements tell you that “micelles remove dirt like a magnet.” The anima-
tion even represents a micelle, like a horseshoe magnet, sweeping up dirt in the 
same way that the magnet would sweep up iron filings. What are micelles? How do 
they work to remove dirt or makeup? Are there other products that do the same 
thing, but without the scientific-sounding word in their names?
Figure 7.5 is an illustration of the structure and arrangement of surfactant mole-
cules in water. A “surfactant” (or surface-active agent) is any molecule that has a 
part which likes to be in water (hydrophilic) and another part that does not like to be 
in water (hydrophobic). This structure is represented schematically in Fig. 7.5 as a 
squiggly black line (hydrophobic tail group) attached to a small yellow circle 
(hydrophilic head group).

Fig. 7.5  Illustration of surfactant molecules in water. At very low concentration, individual surfac-
tant molecules float at random in the water but have a tendency to self-assemble into a monolayer 
at the interface between water and air. Above a certain critical concentration, clusters of molecules, 
called micelles, begin to form in solution
The dual nature of the surfactant molecule gives them the tendency to accumu-
late at the interface between the water and the air, in order to shield the hydrophobic 
tail group from contact with the water. At low concentration, some of the molecules 
will be floating freely in the water and others will begin to accumulate (or self-­
assemble) at the surface of the water. The accumulation of surfactant molecules at 
the air–water interface lowers the surface tension. As the concentration increases, 
more and more surfactant molecules will gather at the surface, and the surface ten-
sion continues to decrease, until a complete monolayer has formed. Once the mono-
layer is formed, there is no more room for the surfactant molecules to continue to 
accumulate at the surface of the water. If the concentration of surfactant in solution 
is increased even further, there will be no further decrease in the surface tension 
(because the monolayer is complete), but the surfactant molecules in solution will 
begin to self-assemble into spherical clusters, called micelles. The hydrophobic tail 
groups are somewhat shielded from contact with the water by pointing toward the 
interior of the micelle. The hydrophilic head groups are on the outside of the micelle 
and are happy to be in contact with the water. The concentration at which the surface 
monolayer is complete and micelles begin to form is called the critical micelle con-
centration, or CMC [37].
This tendency of surfactant molecules to form micelles also makes them useful 
for removing dirt and grease. The formation of a micelle around a bit of dirt or 
grease effectively turns something that is not soluble in water into something that is

mathematics, and the foundation of mathematics is logic. We consider here an 
example from science fiction, in which pure logic is used to solve a life-and-death 
problem. We then turn to an example of the subtle use of logic in advertising to 
manipulate the consumer.
In the original series episode of Star Trek, entitled “The Changeling,” the 
Enterprise is attacked by a small space probe of enormous power. The probe, which 
calls itself Nomad, believes itself to be perfect and believes that its mission is to 
sterilize imperfect biological organisms (which, being translated, means to kill 
them). Fortunately, the probe mistakes Captain Kirk for its creator and breaks off 
the attack. But when Nomad discovers its own imperfection, it self-destructs. The 
beginning of the end occurs when Kirk discovers that Nomad has killed two security 
guards. They engage in the following dialog:
KIRK: You killed two of my…
NOMAD: Creator, your biological units are inefficient.
KIRK: Nomad, it’s about time I told you who and what you are. I’m a biological unit and I 
created you.
NOMAD: Non sequitur. Biological units are inherently inferior. This is an inconsistency 
[38].
Here’s one possible way to express the problem, from Nomad’s perspective.
Nomad’s assumptions:
	1.	 Nomad is perfect
	2.	 Kirk is Nomad’s creator
	3.	 Imperfection cannot create perfection (implied)
	4.	 Biological units are imperfect
New information:
Kirk is a biological unit
Reiteration of prior assumption:
Kirk is Nomad’s creator
Conclusion
“Non sequitur. This is an inconsistency.”
Kirk’s reiteration of Nomad’s prior assumption, “I created you,” does not follow 
from all of the other information. Has Nomad made a mistake somewhere along the 
line? Nomad must re-evaluate the data.
Eventually, Kirk defeats Nomad with logic (something the fans might have 
expected Spock to do, rather than Kirk). He first gets Nomad to re-articulate its 
purpose: to sterilize imperfection. (Note that this is an expansion of Nomad’s mis-
sion to include the sterilization of all imperfection, not just biological imperfec-
tion.) Kirk then reveals the truth about himself that he is not Nomad’s creator. Kirk 
points out that Nomad has committed an error by making that assumption. He goes 
on to say that Nomad made a second error by not recognizing and correcting the first 
error. And if that were not enough, Kirk tells Nomad that it made a third error by not 
sterilizing the imperfection. Nomad becomes paralyzed with cognitive dissonance, 
giving the crew of the Enterprise time to beam it out into space, where it 
self-destructs.

Gradually, with advances in battery technology to make the power pack smaller 
and lighter, and magnet technology, making the speaker smaller, truly portable 
mobile phones came on the market. Nearly 30 years after the television premiere of 
Star Trek, Motorola released its StarTAC cell phone (Fig. 8.1). This was the first 
clamshell-style, or flip phone to come on the market, and prior to its release, I was 
unconvinced of the need of such technology. But the StarTAC bore such a striking 
resemblance to the Star Trek communicator that I was finally convinced I needed to 
buy one.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the 1982 movie, which we have already consid-
ered in other contexts, presaged a bit of useful technology, which became available 
on a range of higher-end motor vehicles in the first decade of the twenty-first cen-
tury. According to the movie, following the surprise attack and crippling of the 
U.S.S. Enterprise by the stolen starship Reliant, Khan, the title character, in com-
mand of Reliant, orders Kirk and the Enterprise to surrender. Unbeknownst to Khan, 
Kirk is able to call up the command code for Reliant and remotely order the ship to 
lower its shields, leaving it vulnerable to counterattack [17]. OnStar was founded in 
1995, more than a decade after Star Trek II was released. And it was not until more 
than 25 years after the movie, in 2009, that OnStar introduced their Stolen Vehicle 
Slowdown feature, allowing a vehicle to be stopped by a remotely transmitted 
­command. Given the degree to which motor vehicle systems have become

Note to the reader: The answers you get for the Estimation problems will depend on 
the assumptions that you have made. Keep in mind that the intent is to come up with 
a reasonable estimate, and not necessarily to obtain the one-and-only correct answer. 
Each of the solutions presented here will include a clear statement of the assump-
tions. If your answer differs from the answer in the solution, it may not be due to a 
mistake but may simply be the result of having made a slightly different set of 
assumptions.
Estimation 2.1: Kirk, Spock, and Jet Boots, Revisited
Let’s assume, for simplicity, that Kirk’s mass and Spock’s mass are the same. Let’s 
also assume that at the instant Spock grabs hold of Kirk’s ankle, the two of them are 
moving with the same speed. The jet boots must then exert a total force on Spock’s 
ankles, which is twice the force that Spock must exert on Kirk’s ankle:

But there are two jet boots working together. So each jet boot separately only 
needs to exert half the total force. The final result is that each of Spock’s ankles feels 
the same force that Spock exerts on Kirk’s one ankle: 1007 lb.

where h is the height (or thickness) of one of the attack ships and g is the accelera-
tion due to gravity. According to the movie dialog, the mass of the mother ship is ¼ 
the mass of the Moon. The mass of the Moon is approximately 7.35 × 1022 kg, so 
mmother_ship = 1.84 × 1022 kg. The diameter of the mother ship is given in the movie as 
550 km, which is twice the radius. So rmother_ship = 275 km. The height, h, of one of 
the attack ships is not given explicitly in the movie, so we have to take a reasonable 
guess based on visual information. We know from the movie dialog that the attack 
ships are 15 miles wide. They are approximately disc-shaped, and a reasonable 
guess for the height might be about 1 mile (or 1.6 km). Substituting all the numbers 
into the equation gives:

Standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 × 105 N/m2, so this result is 
roughly 133,000 atmospheres. For comparison, the pressure at the bottom of the 
Mariana Trench is just over 1000 atmospheres, which is sufficient to crush all but 
the most carefully designed deep sea diving vessels. Thus, the attack ships don’t 
need a death ray. They would crush anything underneath them just by hovering 
overhead.
Estimation 2.3: Newton’s Law of Gravitation Applied to Le 
Voyage dans la Lune
Using Eq. (2.2), we will calculate the ratio of the force of the Moon’s gravity on the 
space capsule, compared to the force of the Earth’s gravity on the space capsule, 
while the capsule is on the surface of the Moon:

The typical cruising speed of a large passenger jet is about 570 miles per hour, or 
250 m/s. The circumference of the Earth is roughly 25,000 miles, so a hypothetical 
nonstop flight would take a minimum of about 44 h. (It is not possible for a large 
passenger jet, with a range of about 3000 miles, to fly nonstop around the world 
without refueling!) Let’s assume that the elapsed time on the jet is 44 h. The time 
that passes in the rest frame (the airport) is given by:

In other words, on a flight by passenger jet around the world, the time elapsed in 
the airport would be greater than the time elapsed on the plane by a mere 55 ns. This 
can easily be measured using high-precision atomic clocks but is not exactly a rec-
ipe for time travel into the future.
Estimation 2.5: Relativity and Fusion-Powered DeLorean
Using the same method as Estimation 2.3, but with a speed of only 88 miles per 
hour, the time dilation factor is only about one part in 1014. If the time elapsed in the 
DeLorean was 60 s, the time elapsed in the parking lot should have been longer by 
just over half a picosecond (0.6 × 10−12 s), which would have been too small to 
measure with a stopwatch.
Estimation 2.6: Relativistic Time Dilation and the Twin 
Paradox
Several different approaches to this problem are possible. Here is just one:
Looking up the speed of the International Space Station in orbit around the Earth 
and rounding off the time that Scott Kelly spent aboard the ISS to be 1 year, we can 
estimate the amount of time that passed for Mark Kelly, who remained on Earth:

So the additional time that passed on Earth was 0.00000000065 year, or convert-
ing to seconds, we find that Mark is about 0.02 s older than Scott.

Estimation 2.7: Relativity, GPS, and the Importance 
of Time-Keeping
The Special Relativity Effect
For simplicity, consider a point on the equator, compared to a GPS satellite directly 
above the equator, but at a much larger radius. (Add the radius of the Earth to the 
altitude at which the GPS satellites orbit the Earth to get the radius of orbit of the 
satellite.) The average speed for an object in uniform circular motion is given by
	
v
r
t
= 2p
	
where t = 24 h (converted to seconds).
The speed of a point on the surface of the Earth at the equator is approximately 
464 m/s.
The speed of a GPS satellite in geosynchronous orbit above the equator is 
approximately 1932 m/s.
Use these two speeds to calculate the ratio of the relativistic time dilation effect 
for a GPS satellite compared to the effect for a point on the equator:

Due to the effect of relative speed, time runs slower for the GPS clock by about 
one part in 1010, compared to clocks on the surface of the Earth at the equator.
The General Relativity Effect
Compute the ratio of the time experienced by a GPS satellite (add the radius of the 
Earth to the altitude at which the GPS satellites orbit the Earth to get the radius of 
orbit of the satellite) divided by the time experienced by an object on the surface of 
the Earth.

Due to General Relativity, time runs faster for the GPS satellite clock by about 
five parts in 1010, compared to clocks on the surface of the Earth, because the GPS 
clock is farther away from the time-dilating effect of Earth’s gravity.
The gravitational effect is about five times larger than the relative speed effect, 
and the two effects are in opposite directions. Both effects must be taken into 
account in order for the GPS system to work accurately.

The Schwarzschild radius for the Moon is approximately one tenth of a millime-

Let’s use the mass of a Nitrogen molecule (N2). Each of the Nitrogen atoms has 
seven protons and seven neutrons, each of which has a mass of 1.67 × 10−27 kg. This 
gives m = 4.68 × 10−26 kg. Let’s also assume that the temperature of the ship is com-
fortable room temperature of 20  °C, or 293  K. Boltzmann’s constant is 
k = 1.38 × 10−23 J/K. We need to take a guess as to the total volume of the ship, V, 
and the area of the hole in the hull, A. Visual information from the movie suggests 
that the diameter of the hole is about the size of a finger, so a reasonable guess for A 
is about 1 cm2 (or 1 × 10−4 m2). If we take a guess that the linear dimension of the 
interior of the ship is about 10 m, the total volume, V, is about 1000 m3. Substituting 
these quantities into the equation gives

Estimation 3.3: Atoms Inside and on the Surface 
of a Nanoparticle
Let’s assume that the nanoparticle is cubic in shape, with an edge length of 10−9 m. 
The typical spacing between atoms in a crystal is about 1 Å (10−10 m). So each edge 
of the nanoparticle will have about ten atoms along its length. The area of a square 
is the square of its edge length, so each of the eight faces of the cube-shaped 
Appendix D: Solutions to Estimation Problems

318
nanoparticle will have about 10 × 10 = 100 atoms. The total number of atoms on the 
surface of the cube will be roughly 8 × 100 = 800 atoms. The volume of a cube is 
the cube of its edge length, so the entire nanoparticle will have 103 = 1000 atoms. 
80% of the atoms in this nanocube are on the surface!

The heat energy required to vaporize an object is given by Eq. (3.10):

Let’s assume that Picard’s mass is 75 kg. Since all we want is an estimate, let’s 
make the simplifying assumption that the human body is mostly water. The specific 
heat capacity of water is C = 4190 J/kg∙K, and the latent heat of vaporization is 
L = 2.256 × 106 J/kg. The boiling point of water is 100 °C (373 K). If we assume that 
Picard is in good health prior to vaporization, his initial temperature is normal body 
temperature of 37 °C (310 K). Making these substitutions, we get

If the result of Estimation 3.4 seems surprising, consider the amount of time that

Estimation 3.7: Energy Yield of a Photon Torpedo
Einstein’s energy equation is E = mc2. If a photon torpedo combines 1.5 kg of ordi-
nary matter with 1.5 kg of antimatter, the total amount of mass is 3 kg. So the energy 
yield is E  =  (3  kg)(3  ×  108  m/s)2  =  27  ×  1016  J.  Using the conversion factor, 
1 Mt = 4.184 × 1015 J gives 64.5 Mt. If a typical hydrogen bomb has a yield of 10 Mt, 
a photon torpedo delivers the energy equivalent of about 6.5 hydrogen bombs.
Estimation 3.8: Angels and Demons Antimatter Bomb

According to CERN’s website, they can produce something like 107 antiprotons 
per second. In order to create a single gram of antihydrogen, it would require some-
thing like two billion years. Our calculation suggests that the bomb in Angels and 
Demons would have about ¼  g of antimatter. A rough estimate suggests that it 
would take about 500,000 years to collect this much antimatter at CERN.
Estimation 4.1: Physical Storage Space Required for Magnetic 
Data Devices
The contemporary USB hard drive has a storage capacity of 1 TB (1012 bytes). The 
1980s disc pack has a storage capacity of 80 MB (80 × 106 bytes). The number, N, 
of disc packs required to store the same amount of data as the USB drive is just the 
ratio of the two storage capacities: N = (1012 bytes)/(80 × 106 bytes) = 12,500. The 
dimensions of the disc pack are given in Fig. 4.3 (14″ diameter × 5.25″ high). To 
make the estimation simpler, let’s assume that each disc pack is 12″ in diameter × 6″ 
high or a total volume of ½ ft3 each. The total physical storage space required for 
12,500 disc packs would be 6250 ft3. This is the equivalent of a room with a 10 ft 
ceiling and 625 ft2 of floor space (or 25 ft × 25 ft). Compare this to the contemporary 
USB drive, with the same data storage capacity, which fits in the palm of your hand!
Estimation 4.2: Data Storage in the Human Brain
There are widely varying estimates of the data storage capacity of the human brain. 
Table 4.1 gives a conservative estimate of 2.5 PB. The USB drive has a storage 
capacity of 1 TB, so it would take 2500 USB drives to equal the storage capacity of 
the brain. The dimensions of the USB drive are given in Table 4.1: 5″ × 3.5″ × 1″. 
The volume occupied by one USB drive is the product of the three linear dimen-
sions, or 17.5 in.3. 2500 USB drives would occupy a volume of 43,750 in.3, or about 
25 ft3. This is roughly equivalent to the volume occupied by an office desk or a 
refrigerator.

Estimation 4.3: Projecting Data Storage Density 
into the Future
In order to do a meaningful comparison of the data storage densities, we first con-
vert the volume of the three storage devices into a consistent set of units. According 
to Table 4.1, the volume of an average human brain is about 1400 cm3. So let’s 
convert all of the volumes to cubic centimeters. The 1980s disc pack occupies a 
volume of roughly 0.5 ft3. 1 ft3 = 28,317 cm3. So the volume of the disc pack is 
approximately 14,160 cm3. The volume of the USB drive is 17.5 in.3. 1 in.3 = 16.4 cm3. 
So the volume of the USB drive is 287 cm3. Next we calculate the data storage den-
sity of each device by dividing the storage capacity by the volume. The results are 
the following:
Data storage device
Storage capacity
Volume (cm3)
Storage density
Disc pack (1980)
80 × 106 bytes
14,160
5.65 kB/cm3
USB drive (2010)
1 × 1012 bytes
287
3.48 GB/cm3
Human brain
2.5 × 1015 bytes
1400
1.79 TB/cm3
This table suggests that state-of-the-art in data storage density has increased by 
nearly six orders of magnitude, from 5.65 kB/cm3 to 3.48 GB/cm3 in 30 years, or 
nearly two orders of magnitude every 10 years. The data storage density of the 
human brain is only about three orders of magnitude greater than the USB hard 
drive. It’s a risky thing to project into the future based on only two data points. But 
if the trend continues at the same rate as it has over the past 30 years, we might 
expect to see a data storage device whose size and capacity are comparable to the 
human brain within the next 15 years.

Estimation 6.1: The Energy and Power Problems

The average power output of the Hoover dam is roughly 2 GW (2 × 109 W). The 
power required for a teleportation event is something like 650,000,000 times the 
power output of the Hoover dam.
Estimation 6.2: The Data Storage Problem
Using the (grossly oversimplified) assumptions as stated in the problem (human 
body is basically water, and each water molecule requires five pieces of information 
to specify its location and orientation), we obtain the following estimate of the num-
ber of pieces of information needed to specify the body:
	
N =
´(
) (

Most of the mass of a water molecule (H2O) is accounted for by the protons and 
neutrons in the hydrogen (one proton each) and the oxygen (eight protons + eight 
neutrons) atoms. Each proton and neutron has a mass of 1.67 × 10−27 kg, so we 
obtain.

State-of-the-art computing hardware in the second decade of twenty-first century 
operates at the peta-scale. That is to say, the data storage capacity of a (room-size) 
computer is of order 1015 bytes, and the processor speed is of order 1015 operations 
per second. In order to store the information (assuming 8 bits per byte), it would 
take roughly 1012 such machines.
Estimation 6.3: The Problem of Computer Processing (CPU) Time
Given state-of-the-art processor speed of 1015 operations per second, the time 
required just to determine all the information would be:

The number of seconds in a year (assuming 365.25 days/year) is 31,557,600. So 
the time required just to determine the information is roughly 369,000 years. Of 
course, we have grossly oversimplified the problem by assuming nothing but water 
in the human body, and only five pieces of quantum information per molecule. The 
problem is even worse because the real limitation is not processor speed, but input-­
output (IO) speed, which is orders of magnitude slower. All things considered, the 
time required to gather the data for a teleportation event would be comparable to the 
age of the universe.

Estimation 6.4: The Problem of Information Degradation
In the scenario as described, the quantum information needed to specify a human 
body has been stored in the transporter buffer (memory) for 75 years. The information 
has degraded by only 0.003%. Assuming the mass of a typical human body of 
75 kg, the loss of information corresponds roughly to 0.00003 × 75 kg = 0.00225 kg 
(or 2.25 g). This doesn’t seem like much. But of course it depends where this 2.25 g 
happens to be within the body. The loss of 2.25 g from the end of a finger would be 
of little consequence. But the loss of 2.25  g from your heart or brain could be 
devastating.

Fig. E.2  A green Uranium glass candlestick with Geiger counter and postal scale provide a simul-
taneous demonstration of all four of the fundamental interactions of physics. The strong nuclear 
force is demonstrated by alpha decay of Uranium-238 (half-life 4.5 billion years) to Thorium-234 
(half-life 24 days). The weak nuclear force is demonstrated by the subsequent beta decay of 
Thorium-234 to Protactinium-234 (half-life 6.7 h), followed by a second beta decay to Uranium-234 
(half-life 0.25 million years). The electromagnetic interaction is demonstrated in several ways: the 
green glass reflects and refracts light and also fluoresces under ultraviolet light; the radioactive 
decay particles ionize the gas in the Geiger tube. The weight of the candlestick (about 12.5 ounces, 
as measured on the postal scale) indicates the force of gravity.
The Geiger counter is set on its most sensitive scale and measures the radiation exposure level at 
the top of the candlestick to be approximately 0.16 milliRoentgens/hour, which is roughly 10 times 
higher than the normal background radiation. (Photo by the author)

Fig. E.3  Radium dial wristwatch c. 1940 and Radium dial travel alarm clock c. 1950. (Photo by

The watch, made in Switzerland, belonged to my wife’s stepfather, who wore it 
during his service in World War II. The alarm clock mechanism and folding travel 
case are marked “Germany,” indicating that they were made prior to the end of 
World War II, but the Radium-painted dial is marked “West Germany,” indicating 
that it was printed and painted after the end of the war.
The radiation exposure level measured at the face of the alarm clock is approxi-
mately 10 times higher than normal background radiation. The exposure level mea-
sured at the face of the watch is approximately 100 times higher than normal 
background. The exposure level measured at the back of the watch is comparable to 
normal background; most of the radiation from the Radium dial being blocked by 
the stainless steel case of the watch.
Much of what we know about the hazards of the exposure of living tissue to alpha 
radiation and X-rays has been learned from studies of the serious illnesses and 
deaths of factory workers, who painted the Radium dials of watches and clocks, 
using Radium paint, to make them glow in the dark. In 1925 Harrison Martland and 
Samin von Sochocky were among the first to devise medical tests to determine if a 
living person is radioactive, due to the ingestion of radium paint and inhalation of 
radium dust, while working in the dial-painting factories.
