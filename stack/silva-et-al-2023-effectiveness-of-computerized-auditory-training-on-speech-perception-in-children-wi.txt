Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using 
computerized auditory training in the auditory perception of speech in children 
who use electronic devices through a systematic review of the literature. 
Method: This is a systematic review based on the elaboration of the following 
guiding question: In hearing-impaired children who use electronic devices, how 
effective is the use of computerized auditory training in the auditory perception 
of speech? The Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Web of Science, 
and Scopus databases and gray literature (Google Scholar and ProQuest) were 
consulted. 
Results: Nine hundred and eighteen records were identified, with additional two 
studies in the citation search, totaling 920 studies. After excluding the 184 
duplicate references, using the Rayyan platform, the titles and abstracts were 
screened (n = 736), with 20 studies selected and considered for full reading. Six 
of the 20 studies were included in the systematic review of the literature. 
Conclusions: Positive and beneficial results regarding computerized auditory 
training are evidenced, which describe and discuss the proof of the effective-
ness of the positive effects on the auditory perception of speech in children 
using hearing aids and cochlear implants with regard to auditory detection 
skills, discrimination, recognition, and auditory memory. The positive results are 
inspiring for the continuity and expansion of studies that further investigate the 
use of computerized auditory training with contemporary technologies and have 
an impact on the improvement of access to specialized intervention. 
The progresses achieved by science in recent centu-
ries, in line with social, cultural, economic, and technolog-
ical changes, directly impacted the health area (Arone & 
Cunha, 2007). Despite this, in the scope of Educational 
Audiology, there was a need to adapt speech therapeutic 
models and offer new proposals, frameworks, and clinical 
actions combined with technologies aimed at children and 
their families, with a view for expanding offers consistent 
with the current contemporary routine with greater oppor-
tunities for family permeability in the therapeutic process 
designed to develop children’s listening skills and rehabilita-
tion services (Bevilacqua & Moret, 2006; Fernandes, 2019). 
The term auditory training refers to a set of acoustic 
activities aimed at activating the auditory system with a 
view to modifying the neural bases and auditory neuronal 
plasticity, increasing nerve connections, synapses, and 
developing and/or improving auditory detection, discrimi-
nation, recognition, and comprehension skills based on 
the optimization of the ambient sound information avail-
able, which may, in some cases, even favor the acquisition 
and development of spoken language (Beier et al., 2015; 
Musiek et al., 2007; Nascimento, 2007). 
Among the available auditory training formats, com-
puterized auditory training stands out. It is a contemporary

therapeutic approach applied to the area of auditory reha-
bilitation, represented by games and technological soft-
ware that use digital resources, reward systems, and posi-
tive and negative reinforcements as an incentive to per-
form auditory activities with a direct impact on the inter-
est of child participation (Musiek et al., 2007; Silva et al., 
2012). Therefore, digital resources as auditory training, 
represented by games and technological software, began 
to be used to support parents and speech therapists, acting 
as 
rehabilitation 
mediators 
in 
minimizing 
hearing 
difficulties. 
The specialized literature points to the effectiveness 
of these technological resources and considers them inno-
vative strategies in facilitating therapeutic intervention due 
to the motivation for children’s participation and continu-
ity of auditory training in the home setting, in addition to 
favoring the control of acoustic stimuli and the selection 
of the level of activities (Beier et al., 2015; Melo et al., 
2015, 2016; Musiek et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2012; Vilela 
et al., 2012). At the same time, we highlight the opportu-
nity to innovate conventional audiological therapy in a 
playful, interesting, comprehensive, modern, versatile, and 
diversified way; the interaction between family, patients, 
and therapists; increased adherence and family empower-
ment in the therapeutic process; the possibility of daily 
training; maintenance of exercises; and the increase in 
cost-effectiveness (Fu & Galvin, 2007; Melo et al., 2015, 
2016; Wu et al., 2007). In this way, digital therapeutic 
resources, associated with the traditional rehabilitation 
model, can minimize the territorial impact of a country 
such as Brazil, making it possible to reach different chil-
dren and families, regardless of their geographic location, 
with a view to reducing the need for trips to specialized 
centers (Melo et al., 2015, 2016). The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the effectiveness of using comput-
erized auditory training in the auditory perception of 
speech in children who use electronic devices through a 
systematic review of the literature. 
Method 
Protocol and Registration 
The writing of this review was based on the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, using the PRISMA 2020 
checklist (Page et al., 2021), with the research protocol 
registered in the International Prospective Register of Sys-
tematic Reviews, under the identifier CRD42022374353 
(Silva et al., 2022). From the acronym PICO (Population, 
Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes), the following clin-
ical question was elaborated: In hearing-impaired children, 
users of electronic devices, how effective is the use of comput-
erized auditory training in the auditory perception of speech? 
The 
methodological 
aspects 
used 
are 
described 
below: 
Eligibility (PICOs) 
Population (P): children, of both genders, aged from 
0 to 12 years, with hearing impairment, regardless of later-
ality and/or type and/or degree, users of unilateral or 
bilateral electronic devices (cochlear implant [CI] and/or 
hearing aid [HA] and/or bone-anchored prosthesis); 
Intervention (I): auditory rehabilitation using com-
puterized auditory training associated with conventional 
auditory rehabilitation. There was no restriction regarding 
the application protocol (frequency and duration), training 
settings (clinical and/or domestic and/or school), and 
mediation (responsible and/or researcher); 
Comparator/control (C): conventional auditory reha-
bilitation (intergroup) and/or pre- and postcomputerized 
auditory training in the short, medium, and/or long term 
(intragroup); 
Outcome (O): improvement in the auditory percep-
tion of speech in children with hearing loss who use elec-
tronic devices. When considering the existence of different 
tests of auditory perception of speech in the scientific and 
clinical context, there was no restriction regarding the 
instrument used, and the objective was to evaluate the 
analyzed skills and not the tools used; 
Types of study(s): all study designs, except case stud-
ies and/or expert opinion (Schmidt & Brown, 2019). 
Sources of Information 
The Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, PubMed/ 
MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were 
consulted. In addition, a search was carried out in the 
gray literature using Google Scholar and ProQuest disser-
tations and theses, as well as a manual search in the refer-
ences of the studies included. Publications in Portuguese, 
English, and Spanish were considered, with no date restric-
tion, and the search was completed on August 25, 2022. 
Research Strategy 
The identification of studies in each of the selected 
databases was made from the intersection of descriptors 
and synonyms listed in the Medical Subject Headings, 
indexing vocabulary and in the Health Sciences Descrip-
tors library, combined through Boolean operators, as 
described in Appendix A.

Selection Process 
The study selection stage was conducted by two inde-
pendent evaluators. For the management of references, the 
online platform Rayyan Qatar Computing Research Institute 
(QCRI) (Ouzzani et al., 2016) was used. At first, blindly, both 
examiners screened the titles and abstracts, with an almost per-
fect strength of agreement, κ = .97 (Landis & Koch, 1977). 
Upon the occurrence of any conflicts, a third evaluator was 
consulted. Subsequently, after contemplating the eligibility cri-
teria, one evaluator read the entirety of the preselected studies, 
and the  collection of data from the  studies was  included in a  
standardized protocol form. 
Process of Collecting Data and Items 
The information available in the selected studies was 
described in a protocol form in a qualitative summary for-
mat that covered the following (see Table 1): (a) study 
characteristics (author[s], title, journal of publication, year, 
language, and study design); (b) population characteristics 
(sample size, gender, age range, audiological data, and 
electronic device data); (c) intervention characteristics 
(description of computerized auditory training); (d) com-
parator characteristics (control group not exposed to digi-
tal intervention/intergroup comparison) and intragroup 
comparison (pre- and postcomputerized auditory training, 
in the short, medium, and/or long term); and (e) outcome 
characteristics (quantitative and qualitative results related 
to the auditory perception of speech). 
Assessment of the Risk of Bias in the Studies 
The risk of bias was assessed by two independent exam-
iners (κ = 0.99), using the Cochrane Collaboration tools, for 
randomized controlled trials (Risk of Bias [RoB]; Carvalho 
et al., 2013) and nonrandomized controlled trials (Risk Of Bias 
In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions [ROBINS-I]; 
Sterne et al., 2016). In both cases, the domains evaluated were 
classified as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, and uncertain 
bias. Risk of bias assessment figures were generated in the Soft-
ware Review Manager (Version 5.4; Cochrane collaboration). 
Data Analysis 
The studies included in this review were not consid-
ered sufficiently homogeneous, which made it impossible 
to perform a meta-analysis and assess the quality of evi-
dence (Brasil, 2021). The heterogeneity found is due to 
clinical and methodological differences. In addition, most 
studies did not provide information on the estimates of 
effects, with the presentation of p values. It should be 
noted that it was not possible to combine the values to 
synthesize the results and the direction of the effect due to 
the characteristics of the studies. Therefore, a qualitative 
synthesis of the results was carried out. 
Assessment of Reporting Bias 
The objective was to analyze the publication bias 
using funnel charts as an estimate of the intervention effect 
through standard error. However, this evaluation was not 
possible, since less than 10 studies were included in the 
review, which made it impossible to test the asymmetry of 
the funnel chart (Brasil, 2021; Higgins et al., 2019). 
Results and Discussion 
Selection of Studies 
The searches carried out resulted in the identifica-
tion of 918 records, with additional two studies in the cita-
tion search, totaling 920 studies. After excluding the 184 
duplicate references, using the Rayyan platform, the titles 
and abstracts were screened (n = 736), with 20 studies 
selected and considered for full reading (see Appendix B). 
Six of the 20 studies were included in the review. The 
flowchart presented below illustrates the synthesis of the 
selection process (see Figure 1). 
Risk of Bias in Individual Studies 
Figures 2 and 3 show the risk of bias for each item 
of the individual studies, based on Cochrane collaboration 
analysis, for randomized controlled trials (RoB; Carvalho 
et 
al., 
2013) 
and 
nonrandomized 
controlled 
trials 
(ROBINS-I; Sterne et al., 2016), respectively. None of the 
six studies included in the review were classified as having 
a high risk of bias, which supports the reliability of the 
results. Figures 4 and 5 show the risk of bias between 
studies, in percentages, for each item analyzed, for ran-
domized controlled trials (RoB; Carvalho et al., 2013) and 
nonrandomized controlled trials (ROBINS-I; Sterne et al., 
2016), respectively. 
Results of Individual Studies 
The six articles chosen in this systematic review were 
published between 2007 and 2021 (Hagr et al., 2016; 
Rochette & Bigand, 2009; Roman et al., 2016; Silva 
et al., 2012; Tye-Murray et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2007), 
with four (66.7%) nonrandomized controlled trials (Hagr 
et al., 2016; Rochette & Bigand, 2009; Silva et al., 2012; 
Wu et al., 2007) and two (33.3%) randomized controlled 
trials (Roman et al., 2016; Tye-Murray et al., 2022). The 
sample of the studies varied between four and 96 children 
of both genders, aged between 3 and 12 years, mean age

Figure 4. Analysis of risk of bias between studies. This figure was created using Software Review Manager (Version 5.4; Cochrane 
collaboration). 
Although the resulting six studies covered a broad 
age range from 3 to 12 years, all participants were chil-
dren, and the training strategies were purposefully differ-
ent and playfully age appropriate. This was decisive for 
the inclusion of the six studies. 
Another decisive reflection for the inclusion of the 
six 
studies 
with 
participants 
from 
heterogeneous 
age 
groups refers to the notion that, at the most advanced 
ages of the child, mainly between 7 and 12 years old, 
many important changes take place, but this phase consol-
idates what was acquired in the previous phases of child 
development. In addition, although this age group also 
implies new intellectual, psychological, and social acquisi-
tions, children up to the age of 12 years still receive 
greater parental attention, both in terms of therapeutic 
intervention activities and activities related to the use of 
digital technologies in general. There was methodological 
heterogeneity between the studies, with differences related 
to the intervention period, daily time (30–60 min), number 
of sessions (1–5 days), and/or duration (8 days–20 weeks) 
of exposure to the sound activities of computerized audi-
tory training, as well as to the tests and protocols applied 
to evaluate the possible benefits/effects on the auditory 
perception of speech in children (Hagr et al., 2016; Rochette 
& Bigand, 2009; Roman et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2012; 
Tye-Murray et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2007). 
Figure 5. Analysis of risk of bias between studies. This figure was created using Software Review Manager (Version 5.4; Cochrane collaboration). 
Regarding the effectiveness of using computerized 
auditory 
training 
in 
auditory 
speech 
perception, 
the 
research developed by Wu et al. (2007) demonstrated 
immediate improvement in vowel, consonant, and pure-
tone recognition tests applied to HA and CI users. The 
children’s performance at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 was signifi-
cantly superior to the results in the pretraining condition, 
with no significant changes between intervals. Similar 
results were identified in another study with children using 
HAs and CIs, in which auditory training software revealed 
significant effects on detection, discrimination, and mem-
ory skills shortly after its application and 6 months later 
(Rochette & Bigand, 2009). In the research carried out by 
Silva et al. (2012), there was an increase in the responses 
of discrimination skills, recognition, selective and sus-
tained attention, and memory after the application of the 
auditory software. There were no significant records when 
comparing the groups with HAs and CIs. Hagr et al. 
(2016) evaluated the detection and discrimination ability of 
two groups of children with CIs through the subjective

perception of parents. Digital auditory training strategies 
presented better results when compared to the group of chil-
dren exposed exclusively to traditional auditory stimula-
tion. Roman et al. (2016) examined the detection, discrim-
ination, and auditory memory skills of children with CIs 
and identified better performance in the experimental 
group exposed to auditory training when compared to the 
unexposed control group. In the research by Tye-Murray 
et al. (2022), computerized auditory training revealed posi-
tive results in children using HAs and CIs, with more 
expressive scores in the combination of auditory training 
strategies with audiovisual training (orofacial reading). 
The specialized literature points that the use of audi-
tory training consistent with the chronological and audi-
tory age, in addition to the individual demands of each 
child, can favor the use of the resources to interfere with 
the results of auditory performance (Rayes et al., 2019). 
Such aspects are relevant and should be considered when 
selecting the tools used for computerized auditory training 
for children. The present systematic review found a wide 
variability in methodologies and age groups listed in the 
included studies. However, this does not invalidate the sig-
nificant contribution of the results as answers to the 
research question, since the six studies found evidence and 
highlighted the positive impacts derived from exposure to 
computerized auditory training programs on the auditory 
perception of speech in different children with HAs or 
CIs, which were confirmed by the tests applied in the pre-
and postauditory training conditions (Hagr et al., 2016; 
Rochette & Bigand, 2009; Roman et al., 2016; Silva et al., 
2012; Tye-Murray et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2007). It is 
important to note that, despite a study proposing the use 
of computerized auditory training in home setting, it did 
not aim to analyze aspects related to involvement, adher-
ence, and family behavior regarding these resources. 
The analysis of retention is another fundamental 
aspect for the follow-up and evaluation of the benefits after 
the completion of the auditory training since such factors 
can influence the future direction of planning measures and 
speech therapy guidance. In this sense, Roman et al. (2016) 
showed relevant findings on the maintenance of results after 
the end of the training, similarly to Rochette and Bigand 
(2009), who verified the rise, in addition to the maintenance 
of the improvement in the auditory perception of speech 
after 6 months, suggesting that the results obtained can be 
progressive and still impacted by the phenomenon of audi-
tory neuronal plasticity process (Musiek et al., 2007). 
These results are strongly encouraging for providing 
the necessary assistance to speech therapists and families 
of children with hearing loss regarding the use of digital 
resources as auxiliary resources in the therapeutic process. 
Additionally, studies with this purpose may be used as 
knowledge base for the improvement of new technological 
therapeutic models, renewing perspectives in the scenario 
of auditory habilitation and rehabilitation. It was found 
that, in none of the studies included, the abilities of gener-
alization and transfer of improvements to other domains 
of the child’s life were investigated, such as language, 
learning, auditory processing, and quality of life, phenom-
ena listed by Kronenberger et al. (2011) as favorable fac-
tors in auditory training contexts. 
In addition, the studies considered did not propose 
to investigate listening comprehension skills and did not 
disclose the technological resources to a part of the spon-
taneous demand of the population, with a view to offering 
the expansion of the benefits to the whole society. Finally, 
the consulted literature did not show software and/or 
online platforms available in Brazilian Portuguese and/or 
free of charge and/or with open access. 
Conclusions 
The studies identified in the current systematic review 
of the literature presented positive and beneficial results 
regarding the impact of technologies available in the area 
of auditory rehabilitation represented by computerized 
auditory training software. Such findings contributed to 
confirm the effectiveness of the effects of computerized 
auditory training on the auditory perception of speech in 
children using HAs and CIs, including the set of auditory 
detection skills, discrimination, recognition, and auditory 
memory, assessed before and after training. Thus, we 
emphasize the importance of future studies in the area with 
a view for minimizing the effects of these limitations.
