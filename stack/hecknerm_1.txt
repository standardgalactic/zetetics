ABSTRACT 
 
 
This dissertation examines the representation of World War II in First Person Shooters 
(FPSs) and the shift in their perception after the release of Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan 
(1998). It argues that the release of Saving Private Ryan (1998) allowed the genre to unhinge itself 
from a popular discourse critical of immersive video games and attach itself to a discourse that 
regarded embodiment as a privileged way of representing history realistically. 
The first chapter analyzes the PC game Wolfenstein 3D (1992) to establish the genre’s state 
of play before the release of Spielberg’s film. It lays out the limitations faced by the game genre: 
due to the perception that FPSs engage the players’ bodies more directly than other media, they 
found themselves unable to function as fact-based historiographies. As a result, they approached 
representations of WWII by combining them with the genre inventories of science fiction and 
horror. 
Chapter II introduces the term “visceral realism” to analyze the impact of Steven 
Spielberg’s 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan on representations of WWII and their perception. 
It argues that the highly physical opening battle scene in particular shifted the perception of such 
representations from associations with horror and the ‘body genre’ to the idea that bodily 
experienced WWII historiographies offer a privileged access to the hardships and struggles of the 
‘Greatest Generation.’  
Chapter III analyzes the first FPS to react to this shift, Medal of Honor (1999), and argues 
that it unhinged the genre from public controversies in the wake of the Columbine High School 

 
x 
 
 
Massacre by alluding to accepted genres like the spy thriller and ideologies like the celebration of 
the ‘Greatest Generation.’ 
Chapter IV discusses the 2003 FPS Call of Duty and its use of cinematic conventions and 
portrayal of historical artifacts to establish a U.S.-centric narrative of war from the perspectives of 
the U.S., U.K. and USSR troops. I argue that this shift in national subjectivities during the game 
serves as an extension of  Cold War ideology by constructing a moral hierarchy between the United 
States, Great Britain and Communist Russia. 
 
Finally, the conclusion considers the historical and cultural environment of this 
dissertation’s analyses and, using postwar Germany as an example, shows the wide variety of 
possible readings of these games.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Over the course of the 2011 Futurama episode "Overclockwise" (S6E25), the narcissistic 
robot Bender and his friend Fry play the fictional online shooter World of World War II 3. With a 
setting modelled on the representation of D-Day in Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan 
(1998, see Figure 1), Bender’s pixelated US-soldier representation brutally annihilates three 
blasé Nazi officers, who were just "eating some Spätzle and listening to some Kraftwerk." 
Rewarded with the graphics of an enormous American flag (Figure 2), and the words "Allied 
Victory," Bender boasts to his friend: "Did you see me? History came alive, and I killed it!" 
At the risk of appearing to trivialize the serious subject matter of historical representation, 
I chose this parody of WWII shooter franchises (which also references the 2004 online game 
World of Warcraft in its faux title) because it exemplifies how deeply the combination of virtual 
violence, WWII, and displays of American patriotism in video games are engrained in the 
consciousness of the episode’s writers. The nearly flawless virtual recreation of Bender’s 
metallic frame, and the comically hyper-masculine virtual representation of Fry’s scrawny body 
as a muscular Army grunt (Figure 3) addresses, if humorously exaggerates, common 
assumptions about shooter games’ abilities. In public and industrial discourse, shooters immerse 
their players into violent events of the past and allow them to participate in fantasies of power by 
taking the role of the “Greatest Generation” heroes made popular by contemporary depictions of 
WWII. Finally, the anachronistic reference to the German postwar Krautrock band Kraftwerk 

 
1 
 
 
touches on the simultaneous presence of two distinct historical periods—past time and 
play time (Chapman, 90)—that occur when playing these immersive treatments of the past.

Historically, immersion into virtual violence and the treatment of emotionally charged 
historical events were far from an obvious combination. What struck the writers of Futurama as 
a cliché worthy of mockery had developed over the course of the 1990s. At the beginning of that 
period, the First Person Shooter (FPS), a genre of computer and console games which in 2011 
was perceived to be a uniquely immersive medium, lacked the cultural capital to represent 
anything but the most fictionalized battles with monsters and aliens. 
This dissertation surveys the development of FPSs as a vehicle for popular historiography 
between the early 1990s and 2003, using the WWII themed FPS, as an example. The suggestion 
that FPSs constitute a uniquely immersive genre has remained a constant in the language of 
advertising, public perception and, to a lesser extent, academic discourse. During this time period 
the genre’s subject matter dramatically shifted from the explicitly fictional to historical non-
fiction. As examples of historiographical rhetoric, a concept I borrow from the late Hayden 
White’s 1973 publication Metahistory, I analyze the FPSs Medal of Honor (1999) and Call of 
Duty (2003), and their difference from the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3D, to illustrate the change in 
subject matter for which immersive gameplay came to be known. In each chapter I argue that 

 
3 
 
 
this shift exemplifies an alteration in the genre’s cultural capital and a general epistemological 
change in perceptions of viscerality and immersion in American culture.  
Throughout this dissertation I trace the production of FPSs’ perceived ability to immerse 
the player by means of enacting violent virtual acts, which at first created concern from parents 
and educators. Later this aspect of the FPS served as a guarantor of realism and potential 
mediator of knowledge in the representation of violent historical events. While recent 
publications (Baron 2014; Ramsay 2015; Chapman 2016; Allison 2018) have greatly enhanced 
the academic discussion of video games representing history in general and WWII more 
specifically, a narrative of FPS’ move from controversial genre to an acceptable representation of 
emotionally charged historical events remains to be written. My project traces how perceptions 
of immersion in FPS shifted from primarily causing alarm and condemnation to producing 
commendations for using realism in representing the WWII battles of the “Greatest Generation.”  
My project, with its focus on immersive representations of history, opens up an important 
discussion of how the body contributes to public perceptions of truthfulness, authenticity and 
trustworthiness by analyzing the relationship between the body and realism in digital games and 
the films upon which they draw, in addition to the discourse they generate. The topic of trust in 
representations has already yielded a highly productive and well-researched academic discourse 
pertaining to questions of digital images and their relationship to photographic indexicality. This 
line of inquiry has produced a number of publications that evaluated digital culture through the 
eyes of early film theory (among others, the excellent 2007 collection of essays in a special issue 
of differences named Indexicality: Trace and Sign). However, my attention to immersion 
expands this discourse with a focus on corporeal issues by using immersion and its relationship 
to perceptions of authenticity/historical realism as central topics. Recent political and social 

 
4 
 
 
debates and the troubled relationship between U.S. leadership and journalism have infused the 
issue of trust with heightened importance. It is crucial to widen the field of this discourse, and to 
ask how engaging the body—beyond the eye—relates to confidence in a particular ideology or a 
representation of the world. More than a mere semantic play on words, exploring how trust 
relates to our bodies is crucial at a time in which politics overtly speak to our “gut.” 
 
The First-Person Shooter (FPS) – Major Elements and Style  
In order to understand the FPSs central to this dissertation, a basic knowledge of the 
formal properties of the genre, including its aesthetics, facilitations of gameplay, and history, is 
needed.  
The FPS is marked by an interactive representation of conflict, which, due to its violent 
aesthetics and presumed immersive nature, has been controversial since the video game genre 
became widely available. Although their roots trace back to the 1970s, FPSs rose to popularity 
with the id Software PC game Wolfenstein 3D (1992), and its successor Doom (1993). 
Repeatedly at the center of public controversy, the assumption that FPSs and their 
representations of violence engage the body to a higher extent than their counterparts in other 
media (such as film and literature) or other types of digital games has led politicians, media and 
political activists to decry it as a cause for school shootings and other violence.  
When it was widely reported that Eric Harris, one of the two shooters involved in the 
1999 Columbine High School Massacre, had been an enthusiastic player of the Doom series, that 
game, among other FPSs, replaced the fighting game Mortal Kombat (1992) as the primary 
target of public concerns over media’s influence on teenage violence. Immersion, a term the 
game industry still uses to suggest the games’ ability to physically and psychologically engage 
players to the extent that they become absorbed in their virtual worlds, was seen as a cause for 

 
5 
 
 
concern in the aftermath of Columbine,1 since it allegedly left the player with no clear distinction 
between virtual and ‘real-life’ violence.  
In my dissertation, the controversial genre of the FPS serves as a representative example 
of the mainstreaming of physically engaging media, which is directly linked to the question of 
trust. In public discourse, as well as in its own marketing, the genre was and still is largely 
assumed to provide an immersive, and thus bodily engaging, experience. Digital media scholar 
Timothy Welsh (2016) correctly points out that “[v]ideogame companies consistently market 
their products as so intuitive and immersive that they overcome the burden of interface. In other 
words, videogames are sold on still-prevalent assumptions about the immersivity of virtual 
environments” (7). As I will show, until the late 1990s, FPS’ subject matter largely paralleled 
film’s body genres2 by representing highly violent subject matter in a physically engaging 
fashion. While its aesthetics aimed for perceptual realism in recreating physical space and the 
wounded human body in combat, its subject matter focused on overtly fictional narratives 
clustered around the genres of horror and science fiction.  
While a majority of FPS gameplay features had been present well before the historical 
period of my focus, this project is not primarily invested in providing a narrative of technological 
progress and general stylistic changes. Rather, the period between the early 1990s and early 
2000s represents an ideal time to investigate the way a shift in subject matter can reveal an 
evolution in public attitude surrounding immersive representation of violent conflict. Far from 
arguing that computer games are merely an extension of film, I will still employ several terms 
                                                
1 However, as public concerns in the 1980s over pen and paper roleplaying, and the Dungeons & Dragons games 
specifically showed, concern over immersion is by no means a phenomenon of digital media. 
2 I borrow the term “body genre” from Linda Williams’ 1991 essay “Film Bodies: Gender, Genre and Excess.” See 
my discussion on realism below. 

 
6 
 
 
used in formal film analysis, primarily building upon film studies’ and game studies’ established 
vocabulary, and only creating my own terms when established discourse has not yet provided 
appropriate expressions. This will allow me to employ common terminology and a shared 
methodological framework when discussing both FPS and the films from which they draw a 
great part of their aesthetics and narrative. 
 
Space and Perspective 
The name “FPS” alludes to the central aesthetic element of perspective. The game space 
is encountered via a long take (i.e. an uninterrupted sequence) from the point-of-view of the 
player-character, the player’s primary point of identification (for a seminal work on the analysis 
of media across different platforms, cf. Jenkins 2008). The game only disrupts this angle to 
announce the end of the level, or when the player fails a mission, usually by the death of the 
player-character. Such a representation of space attempts to recreate human three-dimensional 
vision. Over the years, programmers have used several strategies to achieve this perspective. 
Early games of the 1970s and early 1980s that featured a first-person viewpoint 
suggested depth via linear perspective (Night Driver, 1976), using scalable sprites to allow 
objects to change size in relation to the player-character’s point of view. In the late 1970s, the 
use of vector graphics brought a more realistic representation of space, which then led to 
wireframe graphics that were rendered on-screen in real time. Figure 4 shows a screenshot from 
Battlezone (1980), an example of wireframe graphics. With crosshairs in the middle of the 
screen, the vectors draw a horizon, a moon, a mountain range, abstract obstacles and an enemy 
tank, while a 2-D Head-Up-Display (HUD, see below) informs the player of game elements, 
such as enemy proximity, remaining lives, score and high score. 

 
7 
 
 
Figure 4: Battlezone (1980) 
Figure 5: Driller (1986) 
 
In the early 1990s, games began using real 3-D computation, and employed filled 
polygons (two-dimensional plane shapes) that made wire-frame graphics appear outdated. An 
early example of filled polygon graphics is Driller (1987), released for the ZX Spectrum (Figure 
5). Not merely outlined with vectors, the polygons suggested plastic objects by using color that 
differentiates them from the background. 
While it is not necessary to understand all the computational strategies, such as ray 
casting,3 used to suggest three-dimensional space over the history of the FPS, it is important to 
note that it is still central to the genre in the present day. As the image of the 2017 FPS Call of 
Duty: WII (Figure 6) shows, the genre’s investment in perceptual realism (as opposed to other 
genres’ more abstract graphics), fuses the view of the player with that of the virtual player-
character, which reveals an interest in what would later be named immersion. 
                                                
3 For an overview of these strategies, as well as an industrial and hardware perspective on the evolution of 3-D 
gaming, cf. Arsenault et al. 2013.

Head-Up Display (HUD) 
Figure 6 exposes another central element of the modern FPS, which can be traced back 
for several decades and originates in military vehicle interfaces: the Head-Up Display (or HUD). 
This system communicates important information about the state of the game to the player. It is a 
(usually two-dimensional) non-diegetic graphical (and/or numerical) interface overlaying the 
visuals of the game space and includes “[s]ome combination of icons and numbers on the screen, 
showing health and ammunition levels and so on” (Jones, 75). Depending on the game, HUDs 
can feature rudimentary information, such as that mentioned above, or more elaborate feedback 
about the player-character, their physical stance (i.e. crouching, crawling, standing, etc.), and the 
enemy’s position.  
In The Meaning of Video Games: Gaming and Textual Strategies (2008), digital 
humanities scholar Steven E. Jones compares HUD’s conventional function to that of the helper-
non-player-character, or helper-NPC (see below), since both provide supportive or necessary 

 
9 
 
 
information about the game to the player (75). Jones pushes back against the common 
assumption that a HUD constitutes a distraction, which not only hampers immersion, but also the 
suspension of disbelief (see also my discussion of Taylor (2003) below). He finds that such a 
non-diegetic display highlights the centrality of gameplay: “[The HUD] is an essential part of the 
particular kind of engagement (not immersion) a player experiences, . . . a reminder that 
gameplay is in the foreground, literally and figuratively” (75). According to Jones, while not in 
service of immersion itself (its presence indeed introduces an element that belongs neither to the 
world of the player, nor to that of the player-character), the HUD facilitates easier play and also 
foregrounds engaging competitive play, rather than immersive pretend play. 
 
I go further than Jones and suggest that the HUD can, in fact, be in service of immersion. 
Especially given its origins in military technology, and participation in what has been called the 
military entertainment complex (Lenoir and Caldwell 2017), this interface between player and 
ludic space in many ways recalls the military interface of soldier and battle. While the HUD was, 
of course, absent from the infantry soldier on which WWII FPSs usually focalize, the games 
anachronistically overlay two historically disparate military experiences. If we allow immersion 
to consist of a multiplicity of factors—some of which might be more present than others at 
different times during the experience—the fact that the HUD ruptures the unity of past time and 
play time does not necessarily negate its use in the immersion process. Rather, the immersive 
experience occurs via a recognizably military, if not temporarily specific, experience represented 
by the HUD. 
 
Non-Player-Characters (NPCs) and Persistent Non-Player Characters (PNPCs) 
While Non-Player-Characters are by no means exclusive to the FPS, my chapters explore 
their function in representing history and their relationship with the player’s experience as 

 
10 
 
 
constituted by the genre’s aesthetic and narrative framework. This makes it necessary to explain 
the concept and its function in some detail. Experimental game designer and game scholar Dan 
Pinchbeck (2009) defines NPCs as agents with some form of individuality that are recognizable 
as separate characters from the background population in games. To him, this individuality 
reveals, particularly outside of cut-scenes, “a greater investment in terms of diegetic and system 
resources” (262). Dynamic, visually represented NPCs require a far greater amount of labor and 
more sophisticated technology to create due to their “capacity to independently interact with the 
world [which is] substantially more costly than a static cut-scene character . . .” (267). The 
additional cost, i.e. labor intensity, can be observed by the fact that the overwhelming majority of 
NPCs are represented via mere audio or cut-scenes in most games (ibid.). Thus, when NPCs 
appear outside of cutscenes they have a heightened importance, as they illustrate one avenue 
where the designers’ have committed a considerable amount of their limited resources. This 
makes them remarkedly suited for my analysis of how design concerns reflect the game’s 
investment in a particular player experience. 
Other than their representation (i.e. whether they appear in cut-scenes or in-game–see 
above), Pinchbeck organizes NPCs, or PNPCs,4 according to the functions they serve within the 
game’s diegesis. Their main function, according to Pinchbeck, lies in their ability to serve as 
“goal-communication and manipulation devices,” broken down into the following categories: 
explicit instruction (“go here and do that”); virtual expansion of opportunities for action 
(i.e., allowing the player to perform an action by proxy, which the player-character itself 
is unable to perform); and finally, offering contextual support and continuity by fulfilling 
a vital role in ensuring that the player’s actions are successfully supported by the 
environment. 
                                                
4 Pinchbeck defines a subcategory of NPCs, Persistent NPCs (PNPCs), as NPCs “presented in the diegesis who 
appear repeatedly or have a definable role in the world and plot” and which are, to an extent, “defined by diegetic 
significance rather than representation” (ibid.). 

 
11 
 
 
The presence (or absence) of NPCs in the FPSs I explore constitute a crucial element of contact 
between the player, the player-character and the game’s diegesis.  
 
Review of Literature 
FPS and the Representation of History 
The FPS as a means of representing WWII began attracting scholarly attention in the 
mid-2000s, when Eva Kingsepp published her seminal essay “Immersive Historicity in World 
War II Digital Games” (2006), in which she argues that popular memory has not only collapsed 
historical events and its filmic representations, but that it, due to the hyperreal edge of 
Spielberg’s images over the black and white documentary footage that they recreate, imagines 
them as the ‘proper’ referent.  
 Kingsepp’s term “immersive historicity” indicates how referencing the spaces of popular 
war films and including historically authentic materials and events constituted the player’s 
feeling of ‘time-travel.’ As a first interrogation of the relationship between historicism and 
immersion, I owe a great deal of my methodological framework to Kingsepp’s writing. Both my 
attention to historical material culture and immersion can in part be traced back to her essay.  
I have not been the only scholar influenced by Kingsepp, for following her influential and 
well-researched article, several writers applied her focus on the connection between material 
culture and a resulting feeling of authenticity in WWII FPS to their own analyses. One of these, 
Brian Rejack (2007), compares the act of playing these games to becoming historical reenactors, 
a group which notoriously evidences an obsession with historically authentic materiality. His 
comparison appears to be somewhat inapplicable to the other media discussed in his study, i.e. 
televisual representations, in particular productions on the History Channel. Equally problematic, 
Rejack appears to claim that the central (if not only) possibility of identification rests on the 

 
12 
 
 
recognition of historical artifacts. He does not account for narrative and suspense-building as 
major factors in identification. However, while I disagree with Rejack’s intense focus on 
historical artifacts as agents for identification, he is certainly right in pointing out that they do 
color the FPS playing experience in meaningful ways. Especially given my focus on viewing 
digital historiographies as rhetoric, the idea of analyzing their employment will be useful in 
identifying how games construct a certain understanding of authenticity and historical realism 
and how this in turn influences a kind of virtually embodied gameplay experience.  
On the other hand, De Groots offers a needed nuanced view of narrative in his 2007 book 
Recycling Culture. He examines certain games’ combination of historical and military 
“authenticity” with the rhetoric of Hollywood narratives. In particular he focuses on the 
focalization via the common citizen-soldier and argues that the encounter of player and game 
results in a dialectic of ‘experience’ and ‘authenticity.’ Recalling Kingsepp’s interest in 
immersion and historicism, an analysis of experience and authenticity reveals de Groot’s 
attention to a similar yet more broadly defined subject matter. Two factors—the experience of 
immersed gameplay and its relation to questions of historical authenticity—constitute a major 
framework for my analyses of historical realism in FPSs. I, too, argue that these games’ claims to 
authenticity are communicated via an immersed state of gameplay, which partly constitutes my 
methodological basis for statements about historiography and the represented historical events 
themselves. 
In his discussion of the psychological dynamics in player/player-character identification, 
Campbell (2008) focusses on the nostalgia for WWII created and tapped into by these games. He 
argues that they ludify historical conflict via the imposition of rules, while at the same time 

 
13 
 
 
eliminating chance and the possibility for player-characters and NPCs5 to produce human error. 
As a result, the games create a controllable, nostalgic remediation of the portrayed events. 
Secondly, he argues that the games draw heavily on Hollywood films like Saving Private Ryan 
(1998) and Enemy at the Gates (2001), as well as on the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers 
(2001). They thus simulate a World War II film, rather than the ‘real’ World War II. His 
convincing point is echoed in several later publications (Ramsay 2015; Allison 2018), including 
a productive critique by Harrison Gish.  
In “Playing the Second World War: Call of Duty and the Telling of History” (2010), Gish 
complicates Campbell’s methodology by arguing that the Call of Duty series fundamentally 
differs from cinematic representations of WWII by opening up “multiple histories, memories, 
and potent interpretations” rather than providing closure. His work joins a growing number of 
writings in the late 2000s and early 2010s which, not unlike early academic writing on digital 
games in general, formed a conversation that sought to redeem these games as useful by 
commending the complexity of the experiences, and the informative exposure to history they can 
provide.6  
Stephanie Fisher’s 2011 essay “Playing with World War II: A Small-Scale Study of 
Learning in Video Games” exemplifies this tendency in scholarship, as she seeks out the 
pedagogically useful aspects of these games. She dismisses concerns grounded in an 
underestimation of the player’s ability to differentiate between genre-driven representations of 
history and the events themselves. In a desire to redeem the FPS’ obsession with material 
                                                
5 Non-Player-Characters, see below 
6 The tendency to justify the discussion on recently emerged media, of course, traces back much farther than this, 
including Münsterberg’s (1916) writings on the photoplay. 

 
14 
 
 
culture, she finds value in learning about the artifacts and weapons, and she observes that initial 
contact with history through these games can serve as a “hook,” prompting players to seek out 
more conventional and scholarly accepted sources. While I strongly empathize with the impulse 
to counter dismissals of recently emerged media by identifying their potential contributions to 
education, I enter this discussion with less interest in the politics of usefulness than a greater 
investment in the games’ immersive rhetoric. 
Debra Ramsay’s “Brutal Games: Call of Duty and the cultural narrative of World War II” 
(2015) emerges partly from the redemptory wish of discovering the ways FPS exposes aspects of 
warfare obscured in other media. Her essay is, however, a far cry from a knee-jerk reaction to 
public anxieties. Instead, it features an impressively creative approach to the age-old question of 
medium specificity. “What happens,” she asks, “when the three elements that define the cultural 
narrative of World War II – the citizen soldier, the “good war,” and the war as a visual construct 
– are translated into a series of contested environments explored primarily through the use and 
deployment of military hardware?” (96). Particularly the idea of the citizen soldier and the “good 
war” noticeably connect the games in my dissertation to the larger popular discourse on WWII, 
including film representations, and reading Ramsay’s work has allowed me to focus on these 
elements. 
Adam Chapman’s Digital Games as History (2016) follows Ramsay’s desire to find a 
productive use for the way digital games provide unique representations of history that differ 
from those in other media like the written word. Using an openly stated formalist approach, 
Chapman analyzes the games’ content as it relates to the formal structures of creation and 
reception. While his knowledge and use of theory is truly impressive, it is mostly his attention to 
formal structures that resonates with my own work. I use formal analyses in every chapter. 

 
15 
 
 
Indeed, my interest in cultural capital and the body is intimately linked to both FPS’ creation—
the intentions in designing the game—and its reception—how the style and subject matter of 
these games contributed to a discourse on immersion and cultural capital. 
Recently, a series of books that partly address video games’ approach to the 
representation of history have emerged, including Ramsay’s American Media and the Memory of 
World War II (2015) which originated from her 2015 article, and Tanine Allison’s Destructive 
Sublime. World War II in American Film and Media (2018). Allison focusses on the aesthetics, 
rather than the narrative of the World War II combat genre across several media, including film 
and digital gaming. Not unlike Gish, she calls for a reevaluation of the genre, arguing that its 
“messages about war are far more ambiguous and contradictory than previously imagined” (4). 
Similar to Chapman, Allison’s close attention to the games’ visuals and their stylistic 
interconnection with Hollywood war film has helped me develop my own categories of analysis 
by tracing the construction of a virtually embodied game experience back to war films like 
Saving Private Ryan. 
However, not all recent works on the FPS concern themselves with the representation of 
history. In his 2016 book Playing War, new media scholar Matthew Thomas Payne analyzes 
what he terms ‘ludic war,’ “the pleasurable experience of playing military-themed video games 
alone or with others” (11). His particular interest lies in the ways this experience feeds into a 
culture of gaming that establishes the subject position of the “ludic soldier” (10). According to 
him, it does so through design choices of the game text itself, its social contexts like gameplay 
communities, and paratexts like advertising campaigns. In spite of using terminology like 
‘pleasure’ and ‘identification’ that originates in psychoanalysis, he is equally indebted to the 
fields of game studies and war studies (in particular Jesper Juul’s (2005) idea of “half-real” and 

 
16 
 
 
Robin Luckham’s (1984) “armament culture” respectively). Payne situates the pleasure produced 
by ludic war within the systems of the military-entertainment complex, late capitalism and their 
historical environment of post-9/11 America. Invested in “how cultural mythology is expressed 
as gameplay during an era of political unease,” (30) he maps the affect produced by the terror 
attack onto the games’ production and reception. 
My own objects of study, while also military shooters, significantly differ from those of 
Payne. The Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games in my analyses fictionalize historical events 
of WWII within the cultural context of the late 1990s’ and early 2000s’ discourse of the 
‘Greatest Generation.’ Payne also devotes a chapter to the Call of Duty franchise, yet, he 
focusses on its Modern Warfare trilogy published between 2007 and 2011 and set in the near 
future. These games’ fetishism of weaponry is thus not connected to the representation of 
historical arms but establishes an ideology of U.S. dominance via high-tech equipment and 
futuristic gun attachments. His chapters on the Tom Clancy-brand shooters and Obama-era drone 
warfare similarly show little overlap with my own focus on U.S.-centric WWII nostalgia. In fact, 
Payne establishes his project’s cultural context as one in which “[a]udiences for contemporary 
war films have been diminishing steadily. . . Even the perennially popular World War II genre 
has not fared as well over this same period . . .” (36) 
It is, however, in his methodology and theoretical framework and his investment in a-
synchronous affect (nostalgia for the past or hope for the future respectively) that his book 
exhibits deep relevance for my own body of research. By way of Henry Jenkins’ (2006) concept 
of media convergence, in which consumers of media construct a personal mythology within 
themselves and through social interaction, Payne frames ludic war as a process that expands well 
beyond the medium itself. His inclusion of social practices and his framing of games as 

 
17 
 
 
processes (Galloway 2006) avoids falling into the trap of neo-formalist analyses which misapply 
to video games a tendency of film criticism to analyze films outside of their social context. As a 
result, Payne is able to track how the games in question interact with the gamers’ political and 
historical setting and analyze the marketing materials that establish a first contact between 
commodity and consumer. 
The author’s analyses do not hinge on WWII nostalgia, however, similarly to my own 
methodology, and by pointing toward the future rather than the past, he connects ‘ludic war’ and 
the games’ mythologies to affective “pre-mediation.” Departing from the trauma inflicted on the 
U.S. on 9/11, he claims that the games’ reimaginations of the 2001 attacks attempt “to give 
players hope that these reimagined 9/11s can have different outcomes than their horrific ur-text” 
(29). Like my own interest in these electronic texts’ ideologies and their calls to proper civilian 
conduct in the face of sacrifice, Payne analyzes how the franchise makes “the stomach believe” 
(74), or in my words, uses the mode of “visceral realism” by sacrificing player-characters and 
shifting subject positions throughout the trilogy. 
Payne cites games going back as far as Missile Command (1980), but still his project is 
not a historical one. Rather than exploring a discreet historical period, he draws parallels between 
his analyses and the Obama administration. In an (auto-)ethnographic chapter, he even shares his 
field notes from participating in networked game parties, as well as interviewing other players, 
cataloguing different play styles and means of acting within this social group. 
 
Immersion 
Janet Murray’s article still functions as a definitive text that investigates how users 
interact with virtual spaces. It is widely cited by other seminal writings on new media, which 

 
18 
 
 
merits a longer discussion of her thesis.7 Murray’s concept of immersion is explicitly based on 
and therefore limited by the word’s literal meaning—submerging something in a liquid—which 
results in an “ontological binary” (Welsh, 26) that produces a false dichotomy between physical 
and virtual reality. According to her, immersion constitutes: 
[t]he experience of being transported to an elaborately simulated place . . . the 
sensation of being surrounded by a completely other reality, as different as water 
is from air, that takes over all of our attention, our whole perceptual apparatus . . . 
[I]n a participatory medium, immersion implies learning to swim, to do the things 
that the new environment makes possible. (Murray, 98-99)  
 
Murray’s definition emerges from analyses of reading literature and casts a wide 
net that extends beyond the study of video games to include a consideration of 
participatory storytelling. Her conceptual framework strongly hinges on the body 
experiencing sensory overload, and thus being transported to a different place entirely. 
Despite the critiques, this argument has undeniable merit, which has without a doubt 
contributed to the work’s status as a classic.  
Applying Murray’s ideas to video games, however, requires attention to medium-
specificity. The scholar needs to make sure not to misapply inapplicable aspects of literature to 
games. This issue led Welsh to entirely dismiss the concept of immersion in favor of creating 
new terminology. Emphasizing the constant overlap between both, not-so distinct, “states” of the 
physical and the virtual, Welsh opts for the term “mixed realism.” I strongly agree that “mixed 
realism” constitutes a welcome corrective to naïve assumptions that downplay the participant’s 
agency in dealing with virtual worlds. I am, however, concerned that the term, with its use of the 
past participle, is less useful in describing the ideological labor performed by the medium to pull 
                                                
7 in Wolf and Perron 2003: Wolf and Perron, “Introduction”; Holland, Jenkins and Squire, “Theory by Design”; 
Filiciak, “Hyperidentities”; Grodal, “Stories for Eye, Ear, and Muscles”; Consalvo, “Hot Dates and Fairy-Tale 
Romances”; Perron, “From Gamers to Players and Gameplayers”; Juul 2005; Manovich 2001. 

 
19 
 
 
(i.e. immerse) the participant into the other state it offers. Above all, my problem with the term 
hinges on the fact that the concept of “mixed realism” describes a state one encounters, rather 
than its inception and dynamics.  
Welsh is right when he critiques “the still-prominent description of media-generated 
environments as ‘immersive’, a metaphor that castes these virtualities as ‘a completely other 
reality’,” as “falsely dividing art from life and the virtual from the real . . .” (19). However, given 
my interest in ideology, Murray’s term “immersion” remains highly useful to my analyses. My 
definition differs from hers slightly by regarding “immersion” not as a total and uncontrolled loss 
of awareness of the physical world, but as a player-driven mediation between forces that exist on 
either side of the screen. My sense of immersion indicates a creation of a third state between the 
world of the player and that of the game. Yet, maintaining Murray’s terminology will allow me 
to highlight the body and the visceral in a way that “mixed realism” could not. Not breaking with 
established terminology carries the risk of uncritically adopting assumptions from both the 
term’s use in academic discourse and, even more problematically, the promises of the gaming 
industry. It is thus important to approach “immersion” from a point of view that attaches no 
value judgment to it. I also do not want to imply a binary of either a total state of immersion or 
one of no contact with the medium at all. Considering it as an always-partial framework in which 
the player actively negotiates the pull of the virtual and the physical, allows me to build on 
existing discourse without uncritically adopting its problems. 
My understanding of immersion does not postulate a total state of being. Rather, I find 
that several factors are always at play during the immersed gaming experience in different 
intensities. First, Kingsepp’s idea of time travel constitutes a major factor for immersion in 
WWII FPSs. The player’s encounter of artifacts perceived to uniquely represent the historical 

 
20 
 
 
setting of the game (most notably weapons, but also photography) or antiquated language 
function as catalysts for immersion. Jamie Baron (2014) found that the inclusion of historical 
materials in other media triggers what she names the “archive effect.” Using popular 
historiographies from sources like The History Channel as evidence, Baron identifies a rhetorical 
strategy of appropriating preexisting media from various sources to produce trusted narratives of 
historical events. In the temporal disparity between production and (repurposed) exhibition, these 
media serve as ‘evidence’, as they suggest meticulous research and historical ‘truths’ to the 
viewer. This “archivalness,” as she refers to it, is brought about by explicit temporal disparity 
and claims of rarity.8 This, in turn, suggests the experience of an evidentiary revelation. In my 
use of immersion, it is exactly this trust that facilitates the suspension of disbelief in the player 
and allows them to become immersed in the time period represented in the game.  
The intention to immerse the player directly into a past event is less common in WWII 
FPS than immersion by proxy of cinematic representations of that same period. I agree with 
Kingsepp when she says that these games represent popular war films, rather than WWII 
‘proper’. For example, she claims that the aesthetics of Saving Private Ryan have become such a 
pervasive trope in the representation of WWII that alluding to them leads to an experience 
closely resembling the experience produced by a direct allusion to the historical battle itself: “I 
would propose that in [the games], it is primarily a simulation of Spielberg’s film that we are 
experiencing, not one of occupied Europe – although in popular memory this may account to just 
about the same” (68). I understand meeting the expectations of the player by referring to the 
                                                
8 Such as the claims that Saving Private Ryan offers a uniquely authentic representation of WWII no prior films 
have achieved, which were widespread among critics and were made by the director himself. 

 
21 
 
 
aesthetics of films—which have come to signify authenticity—to constitute another possible 
source of immersion and to occasionally overlap with the archive effect.  
Meeting expectations, however, does not only occur with references to material culture 
and its accepted representations. References to familiar narratives about WWII, including 
differing ideologies, similarly contributes to a sense of historical authenticity, and immerses the 
player in the game’s diegesis by suggesting trustworthiness. A celebration of the “Greatest 
Generation” is as much part of this mechanism, as a clear hierarchy between different allied 
forces (the Americans outshining their fellow allies, in particular the Russians, in terms of morals 
and military prowess), and a clear good-vs-evil narrative of the war effort. While I do not by any 
means seek to relativize the crimes of Nazi Germany, my suggestion here is that the games’ 
tendency to present an undifferentiated view of the Wehrmacht feeds into accepted narratives of 
WWII that are likely to confirm the player’s existing ideas about that war. 
Psychological identification with the player-character constitutes another immersive 
factor. As I will show in my analyses, providing a back story that explains the player-character’s 
motivations, conflicts, and social background make them a better gateway into the game’s 
diegesis for the player. Digital Humanities librarian Laurie Taylor claims that FPSs, in their 
adaptation of the player-character’s vision, are not well-suited to letting the player experience a 
virtual kind of “embodiment,” a concept that strongly hinges on character identification. In her 
attempt to wed Lacanian psychoanalysis and a player-focused reading of game space, she claims 
that not controlling an on-screen player-character (the paradigm of a Third-Person Shooter), but 
playing “as me” in the FPS hinders spatial immersion: 
Taking in my own actions does not allow me to pass through the screen, but only to act 
on the screen because the screen acts as a divider until I can find a way into the game 
space—a way which an active image provides for and which an icon in a control panel 
does not. Essentially, from a position alone the player cannot enter into the game space as 

 
22 
 
 
part of that game space because of the lack of context which embodiment, in third-person 
point-of-view games, provides. (n.p.) 
 
This inability to gaze at the player-character, according to Taylor, limits character-identification. 
All of the games examined in my chapters use several strategies to counter this 
immersion problem. However, while hindering psychological immersion to a certain extent, 
playing “as me,” that is experiencing the game diegesis through the world of the player-
character, leads to a great amount of perceptual, especially visual identification. Berys Gaut, a 
scholar of philosophy whose work includes writings on aesthetics and emotions, points out that 
“the point-of-view shot is (…) the locus of perceptual identification (the viewer imagining seeing 
what the character fictionally sees), and it does not follow that the viewer identifies with the 
character in all other respects” (265). I share Gaut’s view that perceptual and psychological 
identification are different mechanisms, and I argue that both of these can be present in different 
intensities during an immersed gameplay experience. 
 
As I suggest, the mechanisms of immersion are to a large extent linked to the body. So is 
the different post-Saving Private Ryan mode of realism featured in Medal of Honor and Call of 
Duty. I call this mode “visceral realism.” I develop this term based on the treatment of viscerality 
in feminist film scholar Linda Williams’ seminal essay “Film Bodies: Gender, Genre, and 
Excess” (1991). Williams explores the genres of melodrama, horror and pornography and 
examines the way their portrayals of bodily excess physically engage the viewer. She argues that 
the spectacle of the body in these genres, in particular via displays of fear, sexual pleasure and  
sadness, engage the viewer’s bodies and thus lack the cultural capital of less engaging films: 
“[W]hat may especially mark these body genres as low [in terms of their cultural status] is the 
perception that the body of the spectator is caught up in an almost involuntary mimicry of the 
emotion or sensation of the body on the screen” (4). 

 
23 
 
 
I also link physical engagement to cultural capital in this dissertation, and argue that the 
connection becomes less defined when, after the release of Saving Private Ryan, the immersive 
genre of the FPS changes its style and subject matter. In fact, the newly established connection 
between viscerality and realism resulted in a redemption of the body, allowing immersive genres 
like the FPS to represent ‘highbrow’ scenarios like emotionally charged historical events. 
 
Chapter Structure 
My dissertation will offer a narrative of radical changes in the FPS genre over the course 
of the 1990s and early 2000s, which has resulted in its general perception as an immersive 
vehicle for patriotic WWII historiographies. These changes, as I argue, indicate a more general 
shift in the perception of the body’s place in trustworthy accounts of the past across several 
media. 
I will first establish the FPS’s low cultural capital in the early 1990s by analyzing its 
settings and narratives, both decidedly genre-driven and marked by science fiction and horror 
tropes. I also examine how, at the same time, their representations of space and physical violence 
pursued as much realism as technological constraints allowed.  
In chapter I, I will use aesthetic, ludological, and narrative analyses in the representative 
example of Wolfenstein 3D (1992) to establish a status quo for the violent FPS, from which later 
games will be shown to depart. 
In chapter II, I explore my concept “visceral realism” in a close reading of Saving Private 
Ryan, and its opening battle sequence in particular. Tracing that film’s horror aesthetics and 
comparing audience reactions to Linda Williams’ descriptions of bodily engagement in horror 
film (1991), I argue that Spielberg’s film contributed to the visual and narrative inventory of the 
Hollywood war film and its tropes of historical realism with an intentionally physically 

 
24 
 
 
overwhelming viewer experience. I argue that Spielberg redeems this experience by attaching it 
both to his own cultural capital and that of the American war movie genre. The film’s public 
reception and accolades reframed an engagement with the viewer’s body by means of immersion 
as a desirable mode of reenacting the myths of the “Greatest Generation’s” war efforts. Reports 
spoke of patrons leaving the theater and WWII veterans experiencing PTSD during screenings. 
As a result, the film’s highly immersive portrayals of battle also established its embodied style as 
a not only acceptable, but desirable mode of realism in public discourse that respectfully 
represents emotionally charged violent history. 
Chapter III will trace the aesthetic and thematic shifts in WWII FPSs after the release of 
Saving Private Ryan by comparing Wolfenstein 3D to Medal of Honor (1999). Spielberg had 
some involvement in the latter game, which was heavily promoted. Medal of Honor’s aesthetics 
and narrative share little with Saving Private Ryan. Rather, it was based on the Nintendo 64 
game GoldenEye007 (1997), which in turn was based on the 1995 James Bond thriller 
GoldenEye. Medal of Honor retained much of the fictionalized genre and arcade-based style and 
narrative of its predecessors and remains heavily indebted to genre-driven narratives of the spy 
thriller and the style of the GoldenEye007. The countless reviews that still hail the game as an 
interactive version of Saving Private Ryan reveal how this link with a “star” auteur influenced 
the game’s reception. As I compare the discourse surrounding Medal of Honor and Saving 
Private Ryan, I reveal significant changes in FPSs’ subject matter and claims of historical 
realism: as a result of its association with Spielberg’s movie, Medal of Honor’s immersive nature 
is understood to confirm, rather than undermine its claims to this mode. Together with Call of 
Duty (2003), Medal of Honor established WWII as a primary setting for FPSs and created a 
feedback loop in which immersion emerged as a trustworthy mode of engaging with WWII 

 
25 
 
 
narratives. In turn, FPSs began enjoying a higher cultural capital by evolving as the primary 
digital representation of WWII.  
 
Focusing on an analysis of the 2003 FPS Call of Duty, Chapter IV will then show how in 
the years following Medal of Honor, the WWII FPS consistently moved away from overt genre-
mixing and playful treatment of history to allegedly neutral portrayals of historical events. In 
these later years, the FPS emulated quasi-educational history television programming and 
Hollywood representations of WWII, such as The Longest Day (1962), rather than spy thrillers 
and horror. As the first major post-9/11 representation of American history in video gaming, Call 
of Duty responded to anxieties over convoluted political alliances in the wake of U.S. military 
engagements in the Middle-East by structuring the WWII narrative around the allies’ pan-
national effort. At the same time, it infused this narrative with Hollywood tropes of American 
heroism that established a clear hierarchy among the U.S. Army, the United Kingdom and the 
Russian military, contributing to immersion by confirming the public discourse. 
Finally, the conclusion considers how other national contexts would redefine the meaning 
of these representations of history. Using the example of Germany, I show how a different 
attitude to media censorship changes the political content of Wolfenstein 3D.

 
26 
 
 
 
CHAPTER I 
Wolfenstein 3D (1992) 
In order to historicize the growing acceptance of bodily engagement as a mode of 
representing history in the 1990s, I will analyze the 1992 FPS Wolfenstein 3D. Its overtly 
fictional content, free play with tropes taken from Hollywood history film and genealogical 
connection to competitive arcade play will serve as a baseline to establish the genre’s move 
towards attempted representations of historical authenticity after the release of Saving Private 
Ryan (1998). Both media studies and other publications have predominantly highlighted this 
early example of a First Person Shooter for its contributions to the deeply connected areas of 
game technology and aesthetics9 (Poole 2004, 124; Klevjer 2005; Arsenault et al. 2013). Doing 
so, they have focused on its creation of a perceptually (in particular visually) realistic scenario. 
However, as the same company’s 1993 FPS Doom dwarfed Wolfenstein’s10 contributions to the 
genre due to its introduction of multiplayer gaming, a vastly improved graphics engine, and a 
greater number of copies sold,11 major academic work in game studies that focuses on 
Wolfenstein in its own right, rather than framing it as a stepping stone toward Doom, is scarce. 
German-language writing that addresses the game specifically tends to use it prescriptively as a 
                                                
9 Only in the rarest of instances is it cited as an early example of a narrative convention, i.e. ‘player vs. Nazis’ 
(Fisher, 2013). 
10 In this paper, I use both the names Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein 3D to refer to id Software’s 1992 release, rather 
than to Wolfenstein (2009). 
11 While official numbers are unavailable, this is confirmed in Kushner 2003, 163.

negative example to illustrate effects of media violence (Ladas 2002; Möller 2006; 
Lehmann et al. 2009) or to highlight its popularity among Neo-Nazis (Wieser 1998). While the 
game’s graphics indeed lack the verisimilitude of id Software’s later releases, a closer look at 
both Wolfenstein’s visuals and its mechanics does reveal the genre’s investment in establishing a 
sense of presence in the game space, a concept that hinges on notions such as perceptual realism 
(Lombard and Ditton 1997) fostered by the illusion of real space and movement. The focus of 
North American academic writing, framing Wolfenstein 3D as a milestone toward Doom, which 
downplays the game’s mediality to establish a sense of presence even more successfully, is thus 
comprehensible, yet remains lacking. In this chapter, I will acknowledge the labor of the textual 
and formalist elements that serve Wolfenstein’s immersive pull, creating and meeting 
expectations via genre,12 as well as fostering engagement via the competitive traditions of arcade 
gaming (Kurtz 2002; McMahan 2003).13 
Wolfenstein 3D allows the players to physically feel presence by creating a sense of 
perceptual realism through the simulation of three-dimensional space (Arsenault et al. 2009), 
which frames the avatar’s perspective as an extension of that of the player, the evocation of 
quasi-historical culture, and the genre of the Hollywood war film. This sense is balanced with 
formalist elements that emphasize the textuality of the game, such as the heads-up display 
(hereafter HUD), an on-screen device that provides the player with important information about 
the avatar’s state and inventory, and familiar generic elements of the arcade game (Klevjer, 2). 
Those elements increase playability via familiarity and allow a higher degree of engagement by 
                                                
12 As I will show, however, genre can also contribute to the sense of presence in specific instances.

and presence.

stressing the game’s competitive qualities. Tropes of the sci-fi horror (Garin and Pérez 2009) 
film, another textual element, allow the game to engage the player psychologically by mobilizing 
the genre’s narrative inventory, and thus providing a sense of a rich back story with only 
minimal written narration.  
I also argue that within the German context, the game’s generic elements allude to 
photographic images of Nazi violence and war crimes even more clearly than for a North 
American audience. German studies and related fields have addressed realistic images of Nazi 
crimes by critiquing their effects on the spectator (Adorno 1966; Schulz 2004), discussing their 
readability by German audiences in the wake of WWII (Brink 2003), analyzing their uses in 
fiction films (Didi-Huberman 2011), and researching them as a culturally structured and 
symbolically charged inventory of images that Knoch calls ‘visiographies’14 (2001).  
These investigations into realistic images and their emotional responses will allow me to 
approach the writing on Wolfenstein 3D and its newly technologically established ways of 
immersing the player more vigorously via realistic spaces from a new angle: similar to current 
German historical films, the allusion to Nazi crime performs the labor of purging the guilt those 
images carry by othering both Nazism and the Jewish genocide from the German player. At the 
same time, this process also detaches the Holocaust from its original historical context, rendering 
it less readable. The balance of creating presence by evoking realism and immersing the player 
by decreasing the labor of playing and making sense of the game through the introduction of 
formalist elements, which also ‘guiltlessly’ allude to Auschwitz in the context of Germany, are 
what facilitates the “active creation of belief” (Murray, 110) in Wolfenstein 3D.

Analysis 
In my analysis, I will first provide a description of the game’s opening sequence, and 
then analyze it in its employment of movie opening tropes and the genre of the Hollywood war 
film in order to find out how the game creates presence through a sense of realism. Following 
this, I will take a closer look at the opening theme and explore the different hermeneutic labors it 
can perform either as an “authentic” quotation from Nazi culture, or as a generic marker. 
Evaluating the gameplay itself, the element of the HUD, and perspective, I then connect 
description and analysis more directly: I will first inquire into the HUD’s rupturing role within 
the immersive gamespace, its connection to arcade gaming and engagement, and identify which 
other elements of the game support this connection. I will show how the avatar’s face located on 
the HUD provides an identificatory figure for the player that can potentially alleviate some 
hindrances for presence due to the perspective of the constant POV shot. Genre and referentiality 
are then given a closer look to present how allusions to the body genre of horror and to 
thematically similar films work within the game.  
Finally, I will take the specific German context into consideration, pointing out how the 
graphic killing of Hitler and references to starved prisoners in the game space can evoke images 
of Nazi Germany’s war crimes that have been highly controlled and politically and emotionally 
charged up to the present day. I argue that as the game links those images directly with the 
assault on the highly othered Nazis acted out by the player, they yield the accusational function 
they have acquired throughout postwar German discourse. 
 
Description of the Opening Sequence 
After the opening screen that presents the player with the available memory, sound 
devices, and optional interfaces (i.e. mouse, joystick), and which is closed by pressing a key, a 

 
30 
 
 
pale blue background with a white mock-disclaimer appears, stating that “This program has been 
voluntarily rated PC-13 (Profound Carnage) by id Software” (Figure 7). Simultaneously, the 
Horst-Wessel-Lied is played in a military-march version,15 and continues to do so until either the 
“Options” screen, or the game demo appears (see below): a tuba walking bassline16 of alternating 
quarter notes serves as the basis for two trumpets, one playing the song’s melody, and the other 
doubling it to fill in the harmonies, mostly in thirds and sixths. A snare drum provides the 
straight marching rhythm of eighth notes and groups of two and four sixteenth notes at 
approximately 97 beats per minute, which approximates the tempo ”moderato.”17

Figure 8: Title Screen 
 
                                                
15 This requires a sound card. Using PC speakers for sound effects, etc., did not allow for a rendition of the Horst-
Wessel-Lied. To maintain a level of coherence in my analysis, I will, if not mentioned otherwise, use the full 
original 1992 PC version with the “Nocturnal Missions” pack, rather than refer to any of its many official and 
unofficial ports, and assume that the player has the best possible setup (such as a sound card) anticipated by the 
game. This will allow me to address the immersive features unavailable by alternative configurations (e.g. PC 
speakers) or versions (e.g. shareware version). 
16 All mentioned band instruments are synthetic renderings, not recordings. 
17 While there is, of course, no ‘original recording’ of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, in 1939, the Reich Music Chamber 
instructed musicians to play it faster than 80bpm (Wulf 1963, 128) and the 1934 public rendition captured by Leni 
Riefenstahl’s Triumph des Willens (1935) was performed at 89bpm, so the song’s tempo (of course, not the 
computerized instrumentation) as heard in the game is a realistic rendition of its musical practice during the Third 
Reich.

The blue screen fades to black, and the black screen fades to the title screen,18 which 
shows a representation of a man hiding behind a wall with a gun in his hand, waiting to charge at 
a patrolling Nazi soldier (Figure 8). The man, wearing baggy gray sweat pants and a gray 
sweatshirt, appears in profile at the very left of the image. He is the element of the picture that is 
closest to the spectator, allowing for a detailed view of his angular facial features, grim eyebrows 
and anticipatory smile. The approaching Nazi soldier, who is walking towards the spectator, is 
too far off in the distance to allow for such detail. As his uniform —black boots, brown pants and 
shirt with two large breast pockets, black collar with silver stripes, black belt with silver buckle, 
silver helmet and black gun sling with metallic buckle—resonates with the uniform of the 
paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA), he is easily identified as a Nazi. He is not holding a weapon, 
casting a small shadow towards the man, and looking to the right of the image, i.e. the place 
where the armed man is not hiding). The scene anticipates the general scenario of the game with 
its medium blue brick walls and medium sky-blue doors, gray floors and ceilings with two green 
lamps. The silver and red title, with a chrome-like metallic sheen, reads “Wolfenstein 3-D” in an 
old-style font with extremely pronounced serifs, with hooks and bows reminiscent of blackletter 
types, hereafter called ‘title font’. With a line break after “Wolfenstein,” the right-justified two 
lines bracket the scene just right of the soldier’s head. On the bottom right, the stamp “an id 
Software inc. production” references the game’s designers in all red letters and their blue and 
yellow “id” logo. Providing that the player does not hit a key to advance to the selection menu, 
an artless credit screen with a black and red background acknowledges the id Software inc.’s 
staff by name and position, while the following screen contains the game’s high score list, which 
is headed “High Scores” in the title font. The list comes preloaded with most of id’s staff names, 
                                                
18 Every transition in the opening sequence consists of a swift fade to black, directly followed by a fade in.

and every one of them having reached Episode 1, Level 1 and an identical score of 10,000 points, 
which is easily beaten even by beginning players. If the player still does not press a key, a 
computer-driven gameplay sequence of a bonus level, overlaid with the word “Demo” in the title 
font will begin to play.  
 
Perceptual Realism 
Employing tropes from Hollywood filmmaking (fades, opening montage with non-
diagetic soundtrack, and text), as well as presenting a mock rating of PC-13, referencing the 
MPAA rating of PG-13, Wolfenstein 3D (1992) hints at conventions that resonate, while highly 
constructed in nature, with the narrative verisimilitude and visual realism of Hollywood. The 
first screen’s verbal anticipation of “profound carnage” is translated into visual anticipation in an 
image that shows the moment just before its eruption, building up tension for the upcoming 
violent game.19 Similarly, the PC-13 ‘rating’ screen evokes in its bleakness the disclaimers 
shown in movie theaters before trailers, and as a result is associated with narrative film and its 
conventions. 
While it may seem counterintuitive to argue that using generic markers of the Hollywood 
war film evokes a sense of realism, Kingsepp (2006), a media scholar working on Nazi Germany 
in contemporary popular culture, argues that popular memory has not only collapsed historical 
events and their filmic representations like Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan, but that it, 
due to the hyperreal edge of Spielberg’s images over the black and white documentary footage 
that they recreate in Saving Private Ryan, imagines them as the ‘proper’ referent: 
                                                
19 For a contemplation of visual art suspended in the moment before the outbreak of violence and its effects, see 
Lessing 1766. However, it is important to note that, while Lessing praises Timomachus for painting Medea during 
the moment before murdering her children, rather than during the act, as this leads to its emotional anticipation, he 
does not imagine this anticipation to be of a sadistic nature. 

 
33 
 
 
I would propose that in [the video games] Frontline (and Allied Assault) it is primarily a 
simulation of Spielberg’s film [Saving Private Ryan] that we are experiencing, not one of 
occupied Europe – although in popular memory this may amount to just about the same   
. . . The similarity is mainly experienced through the use of visual elements: you can see 
the same things that appear in the film and, most importantly, in the same hyperrealistic 
way. I would say that this shared hyperreal quality is what makes the game scenario 
connote the Saving Private Ryan version of Omaha beach rather than the well-known 
documentary images that are almost exactly replicated in the film. At work is a most 
intriguing process where our audiovisual conception of history seems to be subject to 
change. (68, 71)  
 
While Wolfenstein 3D is six years older than Saving Private Ryan, and the available war 
films of 1992 would have had a different aesthetics, the underlying principle of realist filmic 
images that attach themselves to memory exists independently of it. German studies’ interest in 
memory and trauma in connection to Nazi Germany makes it an ideal reference point to enquire 
about the relationship between memory and fictionalized accounts of the past; in their 2002 study 
“Opa war kein Nazi” (‘Grandpa was no Nazi’), Welzer, Moller and Tschuggnall, German 
researchers with respective backgrounds in cultural studies, sociology and psychology, show that 
both the memories of German WWII veterans and the way their children and grandchildren 
repeat their stories are heavily mediated by narrative film, including films like Die Brücke (‘The 
Bridge’, 1956), Das Boot (1981) and Schindler’s List (1993). They conclude that it is feature 
films’ lack of an educational agenda that makes them appear as historical truth: 
The insight that particularly narrative films and novels, i.e. explicitly fictional products, 
are regarded as sources for historical truth might not be especially surprising. Yet, what is 
interesting about this is that especially those fictional sources are experienced and 
interpreted as such, that recreate reality directly and with no apparent agenda. Especially 
the feature film’s evidentiary quality of narrating stories and processes without didactic 
tendencies apparently makes it more attractive and objective compared to the purposeful 
forms of mediation in memorials, documentaries, etc. While during the interviews, the 
pedagogical portrayals of history are regularly subject to inquiries about who generated 
the source with which intentions, whether the account was tendentious, boring or 
impudent, the accounts in films and novels remain largely non-valuated and, as a result, 
stay in their consciousness as documents of how it really was. (133, my translation) 

 
34 
 
 
Of course, fiction films are not any more neutral in their presentation, just because their 
“educational” agenda20 is less openly addressed- in fact, this latent ideology became one of the 
very reasons Siegfried Kracauer redefined the “Task of the Film Critic” as that of cultural, rather 
than aesthetic critique in 1932: “Certainly the typical film . . . appears to strive for the absence of 
any identifiable tendency; but that in no way denies that it does not represent specific social 
interests indirectly” (634). However, it is clear to see that their denial of an agenda resonates 
with the people interviewed by Welzer et al. 
Both Kingsepp’s and Welzer et al.’s findings suggest that assuming stylistic features of 
the narrative film will create a sense of perceptual realism, since the genre resonates more 
strongly with its contemporary conceptions, and since, as opposed to much nonfiction, it does 
not overtly or implicitly address its agenda. Murray hints at a connection between realism and 
presence when she writes that “[b]ecause of our desire to experience immersion . . . we use our 
intelligence to reinforce rather than to question the reality21 of the experience” (110). References 
to the Hollywood war film and its specatorial situation in the theater thus serve to give the 
opening the authority of the genre’s realism, contributing to presence. 
 
Historical Music: Realist Allusion or Genre Reference 
The soundtrack for this opening sequence is provided by the Horst-Wessel-Lied, a 
political fight song composed 1929 by the Sturmabteilung member of the same name, which was 
appropriated as an alternative anthem of Nazi Germany during the rule of the Third Reich 
                                                
20 On the didacticism of particularly the German television documentary on Hitler and the Third Reich, see 
Stutterheim 2012. 
21 Of course, I am aware that reality and realism do not connote the same concept, however, Murray’s quote usefully 
underscores the connection between what she calls immersion, and an experience similar to physical reality, an end 
typically served by the conventions of realist aesthetics. 

 
35 
 
 
(Broderick 1995). While the players are unlikely to be familiar with the contents of the song, its 
evocation of fallen SA men killed by communists in the street and its call to one final battle, the 
use of a historical Nazi song contributes a realistic aspect to the film-like intro. Art historian 
Didi-Huberman (2011) explores the particular contribution of silent documentary footage, taken 
1945 during the liberation of the Falkenau camp, to the 1980 war movie The Big Red One, 
identifying several acts of “readability,” one of which can help us understand the relevance of the 
Host-Wessel-Lied. He describes how the images make the gap between reality and its filmic 
reproduction apparent by showing soldiers’ sickened reactions to the “unbearable smell” of 
“gangrenous flesh,” a smell neither captured, nor reproduced by the recording, however, still 
carrying its visible evidence. 
[T]his ‘evidence’ does not actually provide us with any direct access. For the ordeal itself 
exceeds proof, and the images’ atmosphere (both Atmosphäre and Stimmung) exceeds 
visible evidence. The Atmosphäre relates to the fact that the corpses and bodies of the sick 
seen in the 1945 film emitted an unbearable smell that invaded the whole area . . . (106) 
 
With the use of a digitally reproduced instrumental version of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, a gap 
between reality and its own digital reproduction is also informing the relationship between the 
viewer22 and the game’s introduction on the screen. One the one hand, it is an exaggeration of the 
gap between physical reality and the analogue silent film, whose claim to evidence still rests on 
the common assumption of its indexicality, reflecting nature with little or no human interference 
(Bazin 1960): unlike the images, the song is recreated digitally, without any unmediated 
connection to an original analogue sound recording. On the other hand, this instrumental version 
does not evoke the cultural and historical context of the song’s lyrics, but merely allows access to 
its musical qualities. It is thusly, in the words of Didi-Huberman, “unreadable” as evidence, but 
                                                
22 As the introduction is not interactive, and attempts to recreate cinematic tropes, it appears more appropriate to 
frame the situation at that particular moment as that of a viewer, rather than that of a player. 

 
36 
 
 
just like the soldiers’ reactions to the smell indirectly recorded the scene’s Atmosphäre without 
being able to reproduce it, the song in its reference to a historical Nazi song that is unclear in its 
specific meaning points to a real past, yet is unable to make it meaningful. Just like the formalist 
conventions of the Hollywood cinema evoke its realist claims, the digitally reconstructed, 
decontextualized song evokes the imagination of its original context. 
This analysis, of course, assumes that the viewer is able to recognize the Horst-Wessel-
Lied. However, even without this knowledge, the music serves an immersive purpose, but, as 
player comments online suggest, rather than evoking historical presence via a reproduction of 
historical music, they are likely to be of a directly genre-driven nature. Depending on the viewer, 
the song can both facilitate immersion via a decontextualized allusion to Nazi history, and allow 
for a far more general reading. Indeed, the snare drum-heavy marching rhythm resonates with 
Frank DeVol’s “Main Title” of The Dirty Dozen (1967), Maurice Jarre’s “The Longest Day 
March” (1962), or Lalo Schifrin’s “Kelly’s Heroes” from the 1970 film of the same title.23 If 
genre is to be defined in what Rick Altman would identify as a semantic approach, focusing “on 
a list of common traits, attitudes, characters, shots, locations, set, and the like” (219), then the 
soundtrack as a generic element of the war film might as such also support the immersive quality 
of the introduction’s affinity for—pre Saving Private Ryan and thus experienced as mediated—
Hollywood war film.

Formalist and Realist Foundations for Immersion and Presence in Wolfenstein’s Gameplay 
 
Movement, Game Space and HUD 
Using the mouse, a joystick, or the keyboard, the player can move the avatar forward, 
backward, have it spin around its left or right axes, or strafe left or right (i.e. move laterally to the 
left or to the right). Moving across objects, such as treasures that raise the player’s score, weapons 
and ammunition, keys, extra lives, or objects that restore a certain amount of the avatar’s health 
(first aid kits, puddles of blood, dog food, or food made for human consumption) also serves the 
purpose of collecting them. The other options are using the currently chosen weapon, switching to 
a different weapon,24 and interacting with the environment, i.e. opening doors and secret passages 
or operating the elevators, at the end of every floor, except the last of the episode, which is usually 
finished by killing the “boss,” a hostile character linked to the narrative that is particularly hard to 
kill and survive. 
Wolfenstein returns to “scientific” (McMahan, 71) or “linear perspective” (Wolf 2009, 
152), marking objects as distant by rendering them smaller and having them increase in size as 
they approach the player’s point of view. This perspective was particularly popular with arcade 
games in the 1970s and 1980s. Unlike earlier uses of this view, however, the game neither restricts 
itself to the mere outlining of objects (“wireframing”) in an open space, or a monochromatic color 
scheme, but puts “the player into rooms, separated by doors, with walls receding realistically into 
the distance and populated with bots that took the form of Nazi soldiers for the player to destroy” 
(McMahan, 71). Using the spectrum of 256 colors (Kushner, 97) further contributed to the realistic 
rendering of the space and the objects shown. However, the player’s enemies are drawn two-
dimensionally with pixels that merely increase in size when they approach (“Pseudo-3D”, 
                                                
24 Provided a different weapon is available. 

 
38 
 
 
Klevjer), making them appear less and less realistic the closer they are to the player. What is more, 
the walls and the floor are perfectly flat and highly similar, making it harder to make sense of the 
maze-like floors, especially given that it is not possible to view the environment from different 
angles by looking up or down, crouching or jumping. 
The HUD (Figure 9) is located below, and entirely disconnected from the window that 
contains the diegetic game space. From left to right, it indicates “Floor,” i.e. the segment of the 
game the player is currently playing); “Score”; “Lives,” indicating how many times the player can 
restart from the beginning of the level after his health reaches 0% before having to restart the game 
from the last save point or the beginning; an animated graphic representation of the avatar’s face 
that indicates its health via bruises, blood, etc. (Figure 10) and its heightened mood in the moment 
the player picks up a powerful weapon; “Ammo,” indicating remaining available bullets for the 
currently selected weapon; two slots that indicate whether one or two of the keys potentially 
needed to proceed within the level’s space are currently held by the player, and the black outline 
of the weapon currently chosen.

Figure 10: The Player-Character and his various stages of health 
 
 
 
The presence of the HUD itself constitutes an issue for perceptive realism, as it not only 
ruptures the continuum of the player’s and the avatar’s vision by introducing an abstract ludic 
element, but also forces the screen showing the game space to be smaller and delineated within the 

 
40 
 
 
main window of the screen. Art historian Oliver Grau, who published Virtual Art: From Illusion 
to Immersion (2003), one of the field’s seminal works on immersive art, singles out the visible 
frame as the central hindrance of immersion, calling immersive visuals vastly different from: 
“images or image spaces that are delimited by a frame that is apparent to the observer…In their 
delineated form these image media stage symbolically the aspect of difference. They leave the 
observer outside and are thus unsuitable for communicating virtual realities in a way that 
overwhelms the senses” (13-4). While the notion of overwhelming the senses is not part of our 
definition of immersion (see Introduction), the disruptive effect of the frame (and the HUD) can 
productively be understood not only symbolically, but perceptively staging difference. 
In order to fully understand the dynamics at work during gameplay, we also have to 
frame Wolfenstein 3D, and the HUD in particular, within the context of arcade gaming, and the 
expectations connected to it. The elements inherited from arcade gaming machines do not only 
allow for a steeper learning curve when playing for the first time, as it makes use of elements 
that are deeply familiar with North American gamers through this ‘bloodline.’ The element of 
competition they introduce also presents another textual element that contributes to the feeling of 
presence, which works against the HUD’s disruptive element of the frame. 
In his investigation of “ideological and interpellative processes” (Kurtz 2002, 107) in 
video games, Andrew Kurtz points to this genealogy:  
As in the most venerable of arcade games, Space Invaders (Atari 1978) and Pac Man 
(Bally/Midway 1980), the general thematic of Wolfenstein 3D (and almost all subsequent 
first-person shooters) was quite simply, kill or be killed, with the litmus test of expertise 
being based upon one's ability to withstand the onslaught of baddies coming in ever-
increasing waves of speed and complexity. (112) 
 

 
41 
 
 
While the sheer mass of pre-1992 video games on the home console market with a similar 
thematic center25 renders Kurtz’s relation via “kill or be killed” less convincing, it is the mention 
of “expertise” that rightly establishes their connection. The social competitive nature of the 
gaming arcade, in which the player shows off their expertise by beating out their competition is 
most clear in direct “two play,” as described in Linda Meadows’s 1985 dissertation 
“Ethnography of a Video Arcade”:  
These games attract large crowds, primarily boys, who yell, clench their fists, give the 
high five, strike victory poses and otherwise behave as though they were in the arena. 
The sports games simulate the playing fields of life where physical skill is a measure of 
overall competency.” (111)  
 
The quote suggests that the elements of Wolfenstein that evoke the arcade game would contribute 
to what McMahan terms ‘engagement,’ enjoying a game not primarily at a narrative, but “at a 
nondiegetic level—at the level of gaining points, devising a winning (or at least a spectacular) 
strategy, and showing off their prowess to other players during the game and afterward, during 
replay” (69). 
Wolfenstein 3D’s most obvious inheritance from the arcades is located in the high score 
list, as mentioned above, preloaded with very low scores that can be ‘beat’ with little skill, 
allowing for a number-one-high score as early as the player’s first game. The score itself is in 
large parts disconnected from the goal of successfully traversing the game’s deadly maze. While 
killing enemies also contributes between 100 and 2000 points to the score, the existence of the 
large amount of “treasure” objects (crosses, chalices, treasure chests and crowns), whose entire 
function lies in raising it by between 100 (cross) and 5000 points (crown) lies outside of the 
game’s narrative. The convention of multiple lives that are prominently displayed throughout the 
                                                
25 To mention just a few of countless examples that were (at least originally) not released as arcade systems: 
Castlevania (1987), Cyborg Hunter (1988), Batman (1990), Double Hawk (1990), etc. 

 
42 
 
 
game, also harkens back to the remaining “credits” in arcade games that indicated how soon the 
player would need to feed the machine more quarters, although it had already become a common 
trope on home consoles and PC games by 1992. 
These elements, which neither contribute to an experiential continuum of player and 
avatar, nor foster the illusion of engaging with a social actor in the game, open up a space for 
competition and a direct quantitative comparison of expertise (how many enemies were killed, 
how many treasures were found) between different players, directly reflecting McMahan’s 
concept of engagement. The player’s engagement, while it is the result of extra-diegetic 
mechanisms that highlight the game’s mediality, of course, does not reduce the sense of 
presence, but rather leads to what Lombard and Ditton call ‘presence as psychological 
immersion’. If we adapt Münsterberg’s useful description of attention, in which “all the other 
sensations become less vivid, less clear, less distinct, less detailed” (84), this connection between 
presence and engagement via competition becomes even clearer, as the goal of beating her 
friends contributes another ludic element on which the player can focus. However, the HUD not 
only contributes this textual catalyst for presence, but, as I will illustrate now, also compensates 
for some immersive shortcomings of the game’s constant POV shot. 
 
Display and Gameplay 
Being hit by a bullet or cut by a knife damages both the avatar’s and its adversaries’ 
health, causing more damage with guns fired from a close distance than from further away. The 
weapons that the player can employ, are, in order of their damage (from lowest to highest), the 
knife, which does not need any bullets and is thus always available to use, the Walther P38 

 
43 
 
 
pistol26, the machine gun, and the chain gun. The weapon is located in the middle of the bottom 
edge of the avatar’s point of view, allowing the player to aim by lining it up with the enemy and 
firing. McMahan does not acknowledge this function, and believes that it is, in fact, the player’s 
hands that are depicted: “Wolfenstein made another innovation, which was adopted by the genre, 
which was to include a representation of hands (the player's hands) clutching a gun at the bottom 
of the screen. The gun is not used for aiming, but it does make the player feel more like they are 
incorporated into the space” (71). Whenever the pistol is fired, the hands tilt up to reveal sleeves 
of the same color as worn by the avatar’s representation on the title screen, but if we accept that 
the player becomes “incorporated into the space,” the hands can indeed be those of the avatar 
and the player at the same time, as she is actively involved in the creation of her belief to be the 
avatar. In Martti Lahti’s “As We Become Machines” (2003), where the author examines how 
games address the body in their creation of a gaming experience and identity, he stresses this 
very point: 
As a representation of the player’s hand (and/or weapon) as a sort of imaginary 
prosthesis, it links the player’s body into the fictional world, again emphasizing a 
continuum between the player’s world and that of the game. . . [C]haracter and player are 
unified into a first-person movement through the virtual space. One effect of this 
unification is the creation of a stronger experiential homology between the fictional world 
of the game and the real world, where virtual space begins to seem continuous with the 
player’s space, rather than sharply delimited by the frame of the monitor . . . (Lahti, 161) 
 
This “experiential homology” is further stimulated by other parts of the game, in particular 
the death sequence. Whenever the avatar is successfully attacked, the entire screen, including the 
HUD indicates this by briefly flashing red, and in the moment its health drops to 0%, the imaginary 
camera pans around to show the enemy that delivered the killing attack, and small red pixels take

over the game screen, until it is entirely filled out. The death of the avatar and the simultaneous 
loss of vision of the game world might at first appear as an aspectual unification, and thus as 
‘presence as transportation’ (since the avatar is not in the physical space of the player), as well as 
presence as perceptual immersion, as the blood gradually blinding the avatar gradually blocks the 
player’s view. However, only the avatar’s view bleeds over in the moment of its death, and the 
HUD remains fully visible to the player, suggesting a perceptive rupture between both parties 
(Figure 11). 
 
Figure 11: Game over 
What is more, the moment of death presents an intertextual allusion that highlights the 
constructedness of the game experience. The cliché of the POV shot, increasingly blinded by 
blood, has been a staple of the James Bond franchise since 1962’s Dr. No and alludes to the spy 
movie genre all the more powerfully, since the world of the game (indiscriminate violence caused 
by a superior protagonist in an extremely hostile space with one central enemy at the conclusion)

resonates with the series’ premises. The fact that Timothy Dalton’s notoriously brutal 
embodiments of Agent 007 were the last to be released (1987, 1989) before Wolfenstein 3D further 
emphasizes this connection. When it is channeled through an allusion in another medium, such as 
a video game, it would seem obvious that this contact is not fostering the unification of player and 
avatar. Rather, by referring to the non-interactive medium of film in the moment the player ceases 
to have agency within the game space, it highlights the end of this unification. 
The 3D perspective in Wolfenstein 3D with its representation of the player’s or the 
avatar’s hand thus serves the purpose of establishing an experiential (i.e. visual) continuum 
through perceptive realism, while the expressive close-up of the avatar’s face, which, as part of 
the formalist HUD, disrupts this continuum, performs the labor of overcoming the issue of not 
being able to ‘pass through the screen’ by offering an empathy-driven ‘way in’, a “presence as 
social actor with medium” (Lombard and Ditton). 
 
Referentiality: Genre, Images of Nazi Crimes and the German Audience 
Rick Altman observes that “the horror film and the thriller—[are] designated by terms 
describing the spectator's reaction rather than filmic content, for it is precisely on heightening 
viewer sensation that generic logic depends” (153). His corpus-based findings resonate with 
“Film Bodies: Gender, Genre and Excess,” the seminal essay of film scholar Linda Williams, in 
which she makes the claim that the success of the genres of pornography, the “woman’s film,” 
and horror is often measured “by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen 
on the screen” (4). Unlike that of Altman, Williams’ work is not based on research into historical 
practice, and is deeply informed by feminist film theory. It hinges on psychoanalytic concepts 
like perversion and originary fantasies and attempts to understand these genres in their relation to 
sexually charged conflicts between bodies that leaves women as the objects of pain. She argues 

 
46 
 
 
that “[i]n horror a violence related to sexual difference is the problem, more violence related to 
sexual difference is also the solution” (9-10). 
So, how do we approach Wolfenstein and its virtually embodied gameplay, which is 
almost completely void of virtual female bodies? And how is a discussion of embodied film 
genres relevant to understanding presence in a video game? I argue that the presence of generic 
markers for horror, e.g. copious amounts of gore, in Wolfenstein does not function as a trigger to 
elicit fear in the player, but rather constitutes a self-aware reference to the genre and other 
representations of Nazism in popular culture that use horror tropes. In her analysis of Inglourious 
Basterds (2009), German Studies scholar Sabine Hake discusses Quentin Tarantino’s generic 
mélange and comes to the conclusion that his “appropriation of existing works, genres, and styles 
operates against one of the core assumptions shared by filmic realism and classical narrative, 
namely, that film either provides access to the real, therein serving critical functions, or that it 
creates a convincing illusion of reality, therein having affirmative effects” (Hake 2012, 177). 
Similarly, Wolfenstein contributes to presence by appropriating the body genre of horror; 
however, not having the player experience its typical sensation, but rather evoking its semantic 
catalogue, giving the game the sense of a more fully developed backstory than it explicitly 
provides. 
Noël Carroll (1999) gives a useful list of semantic elements that are part of the horror 
genre, as they elicit the type of emotion it typically provides--fear: 
Harmfulness, of course, is the criterion for fear. Thus, the depictions and descriptions in 
horror films are criterially prefocused to make the prospects for harm salient in the world 
of the fiction. The relevant harms here take the form of threats - generally lethal threats - 
to the protagonists in the horror film, and the locus of these threats is standardly a 
monster, an entity of supernatural or sci-fi provenance whose very existence defies the 
bounds of contemporary scientific understanding . . . But they are also disgusting, and the 
emotive criterion for disgust is impurity. (227-8) 
 

 
47 
 
 
Let us take a look at one of the game’s “bosses,” the final enemy the player has to defeat before 
ending the episode, beginning with Hitler, the final boss of episode 3, “Die, Fuhrer, Die!”. Upon 
walking into the room housing the “Fuhrer,” he is housed in an enormous metallic body suit 
(Figure 12), resembling Batman villain Mr. Freeze (Figure 13).

48 
 
 
 
Figure 14: Hitler without Robot Suit (Partial Screen Shot) 
Mechanic engine noises and their volume allow the player to guess his proximity during the 
battle. After the player successfully attacks him, Hitler strips down to his uniform (Figure 14), 
and finally, after more successful attacks, collapses into a pile of guts, accompanied by 
appropriately ‘wet’ sounds. An intertitle appears, declaring “Let’s see that again!” in a military-
inspired font, and Hitler’s collapse into a gory mess is replayed with a flashing “DeathCam™” 
disclaimer (Figure 15).  
 
Figure 15: Death Cam (partial screenshot) 

 
49 
 
 
In its comically exaggerated violence, this final scene strongly resembles the death of villain 
Arnold Toht and his fellow Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),27 whose faces melt and 
heads explode in medium close-up shots towards the end of the movie. But on top of this direct 
connection between two texts, we can easily find the generic markers as laid out by Carroll, 
namely the threat to the protagonist by a harmful monster “whose very existence defies the 
bounds of contemporary scientific understanding” (227). What is more, the monster’s profoundly 
bloody (and replayed) “impure” death not only dehumanizes it28 even more than the moment it 
wore a robotic suit, but aims to disgust the player, contributing to its monstrosity and dovetailing 
even more with the horror genre. 
Reducing the fetishistic violence exclusively to a generic marker misses its potential 
functions of not only granting the player the sadistic pleasure of punishing the ultimate criminal 
for his atrocities, but of also alluding to the images of fascist genocide without explicitly framing 
them as such. German studies and psychoanalysis provide us with the tools to tend to those 
questions of disavowal and substitution. Habbo Knoch analyzes the rhetorical practices of the 
Holocaust’s photographic representations in postwar Germany, and the codes by which they are 
regulated. He finds that:  
up to the present, the crime’s images have unfolded within a restrained pluralism limited 
by the originary factors of displacement, opposing imposition and coming to terms with 
the war’s aftermath. The perception of the Third Reich has always been subject to 
sensitivity to politicization, whose actual reference was not the crime itself, but its 
representation and the potential for blame attached to their respective degree of (visual) 
concretization. (922, my translation) 
 
                                                
27 The collectable items of a religious nature (crosses, etc.) within the game also allude to this film and its treasures 
of Christianity as illegitimate objects of desire for Nazis. 
28 With Hitler’s emasculating cry for his partner Eva Braun in the moment of death, questions of gender also become 
relevant here. 

 
50 
 
 
The highly mediated and limited circulation of those polysemic photographies (“comparable to 
reading poetic texts,” 34, m.t.) and the labor invested in displacement suggest that the violent 
nature of Hitler’s death in Wolfenstein 3D, and its emphasized representational nature through 
the idea of the “Death Cam™” would readily attach themselves to said images, or fantasies that 
have stood in for them due to their unavailability. 
 
Figure 16: Allusions to the Holocaust 
Of course, the game not only punishes Nazis, but also alludes to their crimes more 
directly, albeit in much less graphic ways. The very first visual of gameplay (Illustration 4) 
frames the protagonist as a prisoner who has just managed to shoot his guard with his own 
weapon (the Walther P38 gun he is holding is indeed a weapon used by the Wehrmacht), and 
throughout the game, the player comes across skeletons suspended from the ceiling or piles of 
bones on the floor (Figure 16), often in small prison cells with rations of food in them. Those 

 
51 
 
 
images of victims restage the images referred to by Knoch in a non-photographic way, and the 
game allows to instantly punish the clearly identified villains for their crimes.  
Hitler is othered by several strategies within the game. He is given the clear role of the 
super-villain via his concluding position in the episode’s narrative and his robot suit, as well as 
by generally touching on the horror genre’s syntactic slot of the monster. Containing Hitler and 
the ‘official’ perpetrators of the Holocaust safely within their own world via historicity29 is also a 
common trait in recent German historical dramas. Sabine Hake finds their functions to be similar 
to those I have found Hitler as a super-villain to perform. They  
approach the Third Reich as a distinct historical period, an integral part of post-fascist 
identity construction . . . As a performance of incomprehensible otherness, the Nazi past 
can thus be purged of the rhetoric of collective guilt and integrated into the heterogeneous 
narratives that today constitute German identity within the discourses of the post-
national. (Hake 2012b, 102) 
 
While Hake carefully situates her analysis within German media culture and ascribes an 
intentionality to the texts by pointing out that this culture has “since 1989 provided legitimizing 
narratives for the new Berlin republic” (101), such an intentionality would not be sensible to 
presume for the makers of Wolfenstein, given the game was not produced or even localized30 for 
the German market. Yet, the mechanics at work are similar. The game is capable of othering the 
Nazi past and distancing the German player from the alluded images’ baggage of guilt. Rather 
than disavowing the transgression committed by the avatar, as Douglas Thomas’s work on 
racism in online games (2008) might suggest, the German players can embrace the violence as an 
othering act that frames her within a position, in which the images of the camps are not evoking 
their guilt, but the guilt of their antagonists and, by extension, their other.

Adorno rejected photorealistic representations of Nazi crimes due to their emotionally 
distancing and jading effects on the viewer (1966, see also the introduction in Knoch). 
Approaching their content indirectly through the highly mediated and fictionalized genre-driven 
Hitler-killer Wolfenstein might at first seem like a productive way for German audiences to 
engage with the past.31 However, this perspective frames postwar Germany as the ‘actual’ victim 
of the Third Reich, and uses the representation of victims to overcome this guilt, overwriting 
their potential usability to commemorate and understand. In his study of post-Schindler’s List 
films on the Holocaust, Matthias N. Lorenz, strongly critiques the trend of what he calls 
“meaningless allusions to the holocaust” (274, m.t.), and points out that, indeed, remembering 
the victims is not the purpose of these references. He rather claims that “the prosecution of the 
Jews, the events in the camps and the gas chambers have by now denigrated into a versatile code. 
This code . . . serves to emotionalize, not to inform or commemorate.” (ibid.) 
It would be problematic to celebrate Wolfenstein 3D as a renewed subconscious access to 
images of Nazi crime for German audiences. Current writings in German studies rather suggest 
that it functions similarly to narrative film by separating them from a useful historical context. Its 
potentially cathartic effect of killing the highly othered Nazi villains also anticipates the German 
media culture’s present trend of purging audience of guilt and drawing clear lines between those 
that committed crimes and those that built what is now the Berlin Republic. 
 
Conclusion 
With my analysis, I have contributed to the current writing on Wolfenstein by 
highlighting not only its new contributions to video gaming that resulted in a heightened sense of 
                                                
31 For the sake of the argument, let us disregard the obvious point of Adorno’s rejection of Germany distancing itself 
from its guilt.

realism. I also acknowledged the many ways its creation of presence hinges on its textuality, 
mediality and referentiality, also taking into account the particular situation of Germany and the 
local status of images of Nazi crimes. 
 Film studies can complement this analysis with a rich set of tools to critically evaluate 
perceptual realism and to challenge its allegedly neutral status. Formalist Eisenstein describes 
“absolute realist perception” as an ideological construction (Eisenstein 1929), while realist Bazin 
reads cinema as both indexical and conventional “objectivity in time” (Bazin 1960, 14), as it 
reproduces reality without human interference, but also “a language” (ibid., 16). An analysis of 
the man-made reproduction of real space in digital images according to generic conventions and 
technological limitations in Wolfenstein 3D deserves even more scrutiny than photorealistic film. 
However, Jean-Louis Baudry (1970) arguably offers the most aggressive vehicle for a critique of 
the game’s potential for immersion and presence and the technology, or “apparatus,” behind it, 
bringing movement to the center of attention. Film that seemingly empowers the subject by 
freeing the eye from the body, he argues, in reality exchanges the indeterminate world with 
images whose meanings have already been assigned to them for the viewer. Movement through 
and interaction with the virtual space can already constitute a pleasure in itself (Murray, 129) and 
is of central importance to presence in FPSs (Morris 2002, 87-8), as is agency (McMahan, 69) or 
at least its perception (Murray, 126-8). As a result, Baudry’s idea of the spectator, duped into 
believing that man-made images inscribed with external meanings actually constitute an access 
to reality unburdened by her body, can regain some of its significance that has been so heavily 
critiqued in film studies (Carroll 1988; Bordwell and Carroll 1996) to address questions of 
realism, agency, and the ideological implications of Wolfenstein 3D’s game space. 

 
54 
 
 
First Person Shooters of the 1990s and early 2000s are based on historical and perceptual 
realism both by the industry and the genre’s fans. Identifying textuality as a major source for 
presence and its engaging pleasures not only casts doubt on the direct access to history suggested 
by many of those games, but it proposes that this directness might not even be serving the 
enjoyment of these games as vigorously as is often assumed. Ideology, no doubt, stands between 
much of what is to be found in the games and a more useful narrativization of the past. However, 
my analysis also suggests that hiding such an ideology to foreground directness might not even 
lead to a greater sense of presence or more enjoyment. Players might, in fact, be ready to 
embrace their games as works of fiction.

CHAPTER II 
Between Comforting Familiarity and Physical Discomfort: Saving Private Ryan’s (1998) 
Visceral Realism 
 
Near the beginning of Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan (1998),32 the film’s titular 
character James Ryan, in a flash forward, walks across a war cemetery by Omaha Beach. As he, 
now an elderly man, breaks down crying in front of a grave, his family rushes to help him, while 
a solemn orchestral score underlines the moment’s gravitas. Ryan stares off into space, the camera 
tracking toward his eyes before a cut to 1945’s D-Day. This opening scene closely follows the 
conventions of narrative cinema, especially those of the melodrama or male weepie—a focus on 
the victim, the nostalgic evocation of an ideal past of respectability, and the use of the flashback 
itself (Hayward 239-243). Strategies of continuity like eyeline-matches, a solemn orchestral score 
and a visual inventory that includes close-ups of the American flag and the presence of fallen 
veterans establish a familiar viewer position to the audience and frontload the film’s ideology that 
celebrates the Greatest Generation by allowing the viewer to experience their struggles and 
heroism. 
So reliant on conventional narrative clichés was this scene, that it was critically panned, 
with reviewers calling it “superfluous to the story” (Carson), “dully ceremonial” (Denby), 
                                                
32 Hereafter frequently abbreviated as SPR. 

 
56 
 
 
“conventional” (Doherty 69), “a bad idea badly executed,” and “at once ham-handed and 
patronizing” (Jameson 23).33 While the formulaic opening may have understandably frustrated 
critics, it is effective to examine as a tool for the film’s ideology: it sets up a contrast between 
narrative conventions and the ‘honest’ directness of the following scene’s documentary mode. 
The flashback that follows the opening sequence clashes with that scene’s narrative 
conventions and introduces documentary techniques into the film. A lack of establishing shots 
leads to no clear communication of the profilmic space, the shaky hand-held camera does not 
efface its own presence, blood frequently splatters on its lens. The scene exclusively uses diegetic 
sound and no score. 
However, the battle transcends conventional documentary style by combining it with 
elements that viscerally engage the audience. Similar to what Linda Williams (1992) calls body 
genres and to the immersive video game genre of the First Person Shooter,34 the battle scene’s 
techniques realistically portray the events of D-Day by emulating the emotions experienced by the 
on-screen characters, rather than on neutrally portraying the unfolding events, as would be typical 
for most documentaries. This viscerality suggests an experience of witnessing, and performs the 
rhetorical labor of inscribing the film’s ideology onto the viewer’s body. 
Combining the documentary’s rhetoric of disengaged objectivity with the subjective 
immediacy of body genres and the FPS, Saving Private Ryan strives for a mode which I call 
visceral realism.35 The body genre and the FPS have been subject to criticisms due to their 
                                                
33 Alternatively, many critics chose to negate its existence altogether by referring to the subsequent battle scene as 
the film’s opening (Alleva 29; Major 63). 
34 Hereafter frequently abbreviated as FPS. 
35 While “visceral realism” has been casually employed to describe South Korean action cinema (Yoo 2012), my 
usage within a discourse of historical representation follows a different understanding of the term. 

 
57 
 
 
presumed ability to viscerally engage the viewer. The mode of visceral realism, on the other hand, 
serves as an element of authenticity by foregrounding the physical challenges of the portrayed 
subjects whenever the film’s ideological discourse requires it. In the case of SPR, the portrayal of 
physical stress via a tense viewing experience was perceived as realistic, in part, because it 
reiterated both the tropes of extreme hardship endured by The Greatest Generation and their 
nostalgic celebration. The glorification of The Greatest Generation had been particularly present 
in U.S. discourse around the 50th anniversary celebrations of D-Day in 1994 and remained a 
recurrent theme during SPR’s 1998 release. The film opened around the time that a popular 
discourse highlighted the soldiers’ sacrifice and heroism, as well as their effect on today’s 
standards of living, as central elements of D-Day remembrance. President Clinton’s remarks at D-
Day’s 50th anniversary celebration referred to Omaha Beach as a “hallowed place,” calling it “the 
least ordinary day of the 20th century.” He asked the audience to honor the soldiers’ sacrifice with 
their own lives: “How will we build upon the sacrifice of D-Day’s heroes? Like the soldiers of 
Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We cannot stay safe by doing so. Avoiding today's problems 
would be our own generation's appeasements . . . They struggled in war so that we might strive in 
peace” (Clinton 1994).  
While it was most noticeable shortly before and after the 50th anniversary celebrations, this 
sentiment was still prevalent at the time of SPR’s release in 1998. In June of that year, Michael 
Ollove of Baltimore’s The Sun reported on the creation of a $12 million memorial in honor of D-
Day. An interviewed veteran proudly connects the past battle to the present: “The sacrifices of D-
Day . . . were warranted. Freedom . . . is not free” (n.p.). In the Seattle Times, an anonymous letter 
to the editor warned that the sacrifices of D-Day must not be forgotten, cautioning the reader to: 

 
58 
 
 
“[R]emember how many lives were lost over the centuries just so the rest of us can be the 
privileged recipients of these sacrifices!” (n.p.) 
This chapter argues that, while the Saving Private Ryan’s narrative offers a familiar cast of 
characters that engages the audience by highlighting the struggles of the citizen soldier and using 
the stardom of Tom Hanks, the mode of visceral realism, which was popularized by SPR and is 
particularly present in the film’s opening battle scene, fundamentally reconfigured popular 
conception of historical realism. It does so by positioning the viewer’s physical reactions, and—
by proxy—immersion into the world of the film, as markers of authenticity by confirming common 
assumptions about the nature of the G.I. experience. Both familiar narrative techniques and 
visceral realism nostalgically participate in the celebration of the Greatest Generation by 
embedding claims of authenticity in a combination of viscerality and an emulation of the visuals 
of war photographer Robert Capa who was physically present during the invasion of Omaha Beach 
and the sounds of historical recording technology. 
As I will show in Chapters III and IV, this introduction of viscerality to the representation 
of WWII contributed to a shift in FPSs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which began to focus on 
World War II settings. Ultimately, the use of visceral realism in SPR led to an even greater 
association of historical accuracy with physical engagement and immersion in both film and video 
game genres. 
In this chapter I will first explore the film’s narrative and show how its cast of characters 
fits into the conventional ideology of the heroic citizen-soldier. I will then define the idea of 
visceral realism and embed it the context of its academic discourse. By analyzing the filmmakers’ 
intentions, the discourse surrounding the film, experiential narratives of filmgoers, and, most 

 
59 
 
 
importantly, my own analyses of the film’s style, I use SPR to document the formal properties of 
visceral realism, as it participates in the ideology of the Greatest Generation.  
 
Focalization between the suffering Hero and the Star: The Case of Corporal Upham and 
Captain Miller 
Variety’s Andrew Hindes points out that, while “newly minted heartthrob Matt Damon” 
might attract female audiences, “[Saving Private Ryan’s] biggest opening draw will likely be 
Hanks” (Hindes 6). Advertising decisions confirm this observation: on the film’s promotional 
tour, Spielberg was joined by Hanks, Damon and WWII historian Stephen E. Ambrose (Ibid.), 
while Jeremy Davies, who plays the struggling soldier Upham, was as absent as he is on the 
film’s promotional poster. 
I will now analyze the conventional roles of the characters Upham and Miller in the 
film’s narrative. I pay special attention to how these characters offer the audience a spectrum of 
identification. I also show how the familiar character tropes represented by these two men 
suggest an important counterpoint to the overwhelming and disorienting aesthetics of the 
opening battle scene. By doing so, I anticipate my later explorations of the subject position in 
WWII First Person Shooters, which are constructed on a continuum between the heroic player-
character and the player. This discussion will help me establish the categories of analysis used in 
these later chapters. 
In the film’s narrative, translator and cartographer Corporal Upham is overwhelmed with 
his duties as an active soldier. In spite of not having “held a weapon since basic training” (SPR), 
he is recruited to join a group of six American soldiers under the command of Captain John 
Miller (Tom Hanks) in Normandy. Their mission is to find and send home paratrooper Private 
James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers were killed in action. This task is decidedly 

 
60 
 
 
unpopular with the troops, as they feel like it does not serve the overall war effort and 
unnecessarily puts them at risk. In this tense atmosphere, Upham is shown to struggle with 
unsuccessful attempts to befriend some of the soldiers, who reject him for his physical and class 
differences. His comrades consist of character types usual for the inventory of the WWII combat 
film: the charismatic leader Captain John Miller, rendered doubly attractive to the audience by 
the use of Tom Hanks’ star persona; the cause-driven Sergeant Mike Hovarth; the rebellious 
Private Richard Reiben; Private “Fish” Mellish, whose Jewish heritage drives his strong hatred 
of the Nazis; Italian-American Private Adrian Carpazo, who loses his life while heroically trying 
to safe a French child; the devoted Christian Private Jackson from the American South, and 
Medic Irwin Wade, who will be fatally wounded when supporting the group during an attack. 
This inventory of character types functions as a microcosm of the U.S.’s position as the 
World’s melting pot, which is a widespread convention within the WWII combat genre. The 
group’s ethnic diversity, also, is conventional for the genre. An assembly of different characters 
who often experience dysfunctional group dynamics is by no means exclusive to the WWII 
Combat Film, but the trope’s sustained use within the genre reveals Saving Private Ryan’s 
reliance on its generic traditions.36  
Melting Pot groups have been a popular trope in the American WWII combat film as 
early as Bataan (1943). Bataan’s narrative, set in the Pacific theater, features a multiethnic and 
multicultural37 group of soldiers that differ widely.38 The far more aggressively patriotic John 
                                                
36. Sidney Lumet’s 12 Angry Men (1957), George Lucas’s Star Wars (1977), and the majority of Quentin 
Tarantino’s work are only a few of many possible examples in other genres. 
37 The film stars an African-American, a Mexican-American, and an American from the U.S. South, as well as many 
white Americans from north of the Mason-Dixon line. 
38 Among other character types, the group features an inexperienced and naïve trumpet player and a murderer. 

 
61 
 
 
Wayne-vehicle Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), also situated in the Pacific theater, similarly features a 
diverse inventory of character-types. These types range from the hardboiled Sergeant (Wayne) to 
a pretentious Colonel’s son. The diversity of these characters, from which plot conflicts beyond 
the mission arise, can be traced throughout the genre’s responses to its respective different 
cultural environments throughout history. As an example, Sam Fuller’s Korean-War films like 
The Steel Helmet (1951) served as a metaphor for the state of post-integration U.S. troops, 
featuring different ethnic character-types to illustrate the need to overcome ethnically motivated 
issues for the common cause. 
The pre-Vietnam WWII combat films of the early 1960s, many of which still enjoy 
considerable popularity on channels dedicated to American classics (Turner Classic Movies, 
etc.)39 have sustained the idea of the motley crew of soldiers on a common mission with reruns 
of films like Battle of the Bulge (1965).40  
Spielberg has attempted to frame these tropes as representational of historical squads, 
grounded on screenwriter Robert Rodat’s and his own research, rather than common genre 
conventions.41 However, reviews have commonly recognized SPR’s characters’ predictability 
and their contribution to scenes that serve as grounding counterpoints to the film’s disorienting 
battle sequences. Richard Goldstein of The Village Voice is right when he claims that the film is 
“tapping into the verities of combat films—right down to the fighting unit, with its harmonious

39 The reasons for their remaining popularity, likely in part caused by a yearning for the “just war”, as most 
prominently opposed to the Vietnam war, could be argued to be fueled by similar circumstances as the nostalgia 
surrounding the release of SPR (and Medal of Honor). 
40 And the present day, for that matter. 
41 “[A]fter doing some research, I accepted the diversity of American representatives inside that squad” (“Saving 
Private Ryan” 68).

Richard Alleva notices that, other than Miller, most characters “seem based on the types usually 
found sharing patrols in Hollywood war pictures. There is the Tough Sergeant, the Wise Guy 
Malcontent (last done by Denzel Washington in Glory), the Four-Eyed Intellectual, the Hillbilly 
Sharpshooter now bagging Germans instead of possums” (Alleva). These and other reviews42 
highlight that the characters’ conventionality was well understood. Doherty’s reference to a 
“tension between familiarity and variation” (69), is also useful here, by framing this inventory of 
characters as a familiar, and thus unchallenging, access to the film’s narrative. As I will show, 
such a familiarity presents a counterpoint to the disruptive battle scenes throughout SPR.  
After a group of German troops kill Wade while the squad attempts to destroy a German 
machine gun position, Upham convinces Miller to let the last surviving German, nicknamed 
“Steamboat Willie,” go free and surrender to an Allied patrol. Upham had moral issues with 
executing a POW, but the group reacts in a hostile way to this decision. They are unwilling to let 
the enemy go, and resent Upham for his unwillingness to execute the German. When the squad 
finally locates Private James Ryan to extract him, he heroically refuses to give up his position 
and the men agree to support his unit in defending a bridge. During this successful defense, 
Upham witnesses Steamboat Willie, who had not kept his promise to surrender and instead 
joined another German unit, shoot Miller to death. Miller’s last words are “James [Ryan], earn 
this.” Emotionally overwhelmed by Miller’s death, Upham executes the unarmed German, who 
had surrendered by raising his hands in the air and addressing him by name. Together with Ryan 
and another comrade, Upham is one of only three survivors of the battle. Upham’s toil to 
                                                
42 “This is familiar ground in a war movie: the small group given a difficult mission with lots of time for 
characterization between episodic actions. But familiarity breeds cliché . . .” (Cohen 323); “In good WWII fashion, 
ethnic and religious colors shade in the character details” (Doherty 70); “Between . . . two bravura action sequences, 
Saving Private Ryan is merely a banal war movie with a forced premise and clichéd characters” (Tauben 113).

function as a soldier underline the Greatest Generation’s heroic struggles, while the stardom of 
Tom Hanks connects his celebrity to the celebration of the American G.I.  
 
Upham: The Struggling Soldier 
Upham’s struggles highlight the physical and mental challenges faced by American 
soldiers during WWII. Being fluent in both French and German, he is a man of language, not of 
the body; both his issues as a soldier and his bookishness render him an outsider within his own 
squad. Ralph R Donald, a communication scholar interested in combat film and masculinity, 
points out that wordiness runs counter to one of the central characteristics of the war film’s 
warrior. “Key . . .”, he writes, “is that he should be a man of few words but mighty deeds, 
capable of stoically enduring privations and pain, and be able to pass the stress test that war 
imposes on these qualities” (176). As a result, Upham’s comrades angrily resist his attempts at 
making friends through verbal communication and physical contact that displays a lack of 
military professionalism. As he playfully pokes Private Mellish to start a conversation, he is 
aggressively told off: “You want your head blown off, you fancy little fuck? Don’t you ever 
touch me with those little rat claws again. Get the fuck back in formation.” While this conflict 
also hints at issues of class and sexuality (“fancy”), the major issue consists of not acting 
professionally, and not being physically suited (“little rat claws”) to be socially accepted by the 
group. The hateful, vaguely anti-Semitic, language used by Mellish both serves as a marker of 
class-difference (vs. the restrained white-collar discourse employed by Upham), and underlines 
his urgency to differentiate himself from the translator. 
As these dynamics show, Upham lets the audience experience the story from the point of 
view of a man who struggles to perform his soldierly duties, overwhelmed by the events and 
troubled by being unable to fit in with his comrades. However, this focalization does by no 

 
64 
 
 
means constitute a single and rigid viewer position. Rather, the heroic figure of Captain Miller, 
played by celebrated actor Tom Hanks, adds the pole of identification via desire to the viewer. 
As a result, the film’s narrative offers an identificatory continuum between these poles and 
allows for many different viewing experiences. 
 
Miller: The Star Citizen-Soldier 
In the five years prior to filming SPR, Tom Hanks had won Academy Awards for his 
work in Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994) and played the lead character in the 
successful space drama Apollo 13 (1995). His previously established stardom contributes to 
Miller’s central position in SPR’s cast of characters and the viewer’s potential experience of the 
film. 
At the beginning of the battle sequence, Miller is the first troop member recognizable by 
face. In the absence of Upham, who only enters the narrative after minute 40, the scene’s 
aesthetics privilege Miller by simulating his point of view (see below). Unlike Corp. Upham, 
who is set apart by lack of experience while still outranking most members of the squad, its 
leader Captain Miller is marked as superior by rank and character. This hierarchy is addressed 
when Pfc. Richard Reiben asks Miller whether he “don’t gripe at all” about the controversial 
mission. Miller replies: “I’m a captain. There’s a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down. . . I 
don’t gripe to you. I don’t gripe in front of you. You should know that as a Ranger.” 
Beyond his rank, Miller differentiates himself43 by keeping his private life hidden from 
the squad for a large portion of the film, which gives him a quasi-mystical status within the 
                                                
43 Unlike Miller, many of the troops openly discuss private matters. Reiben narrates that his former superintendent’s 
wife accidentally revealed her breasts to him, giving him an erection “the size of the Statue of Liberty.” Fighting 
back tears, technician fourth grade Wade shares his regret about pretending to be asleep when his mother returned 
from her night shift to speak about her day. Similarly, Religion plays a major part in the characterization of Mellish 

 
65 
 
 
group. The squad even places bets on his job at home, resulting in a $300 jackpot. “I’ve been 
with him since Kasserine Pass,” Technical Sgt. Mike Horvath tells Upham, “and I don’t have a 
clue [where he is from and what he did for a living].” 
The troops jokingly address Miller’s super-human status when bantering, especially 
Reiben: “I got a mother, all right? I mean, you got a mother, Sarge has got a mother. I mean, shit, 
I bet even the Captain’s got a mother,” he quips at the mission’s beginning, adding “[w]ell, 
maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us got mothers.” At a later point he informs Upham that 
“Captain didn’t go to school. They assembled him at O.C.S. [Officer Candidate School] out of 
spare body parts of dead G.I.s.” 
When Miller finally reveals himself to be a married teacher of English Composition to 
distract two of his men from a fight that threatens to escalate into friendly fire, the squad is 
flabbergasted: “I’ll be doggone,” Horvath gasps, as the normality of Miller’s life contradicts the 
squad’s speculations. Literature scholar Cohen questions the cinematic logic of the reveal and the 
baffled reactions it caused, claiming that the film really depicts the audience’s hoped for 
response to this humble citizen-soldier, while the troops’ reactions make little sense. To 
Spielberg, he claims, the reveal “represents . . . the mystical citizen-soldier theme: the 
disgruntled soldiers are somehow supposed to feel this” (324). Miller, the mystical hero, is 
revealed to be an ordinary citizen-soldier, rather than claiming an essentially heroic nature of 
soldiers, which the scene suggests being an underlying assumption on the part of the surprised 
audience.  
                                                
(Jewish), and Jackson (Christian), both of which wear religious insignia, while Miller is never revealed to have any 
affiliation or shown praying. 

 
66 
 
 
Finally, a conversation between the ordinary, yet still heroic, Private Ryan and Cpt. 
Miller highlights the difference between the two men via the latter’s unwillingness to share his 
private life. After losing several of his men to the mission, Miller hopes that “[t]his Ryan better 
be worth it. He better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or 
something.” However, after the squad finds Ryan, the latter tells Miller a story about mocking 
and humiliating a “girl who just took a nose dive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming 
down” back home. Both his crass actions and misogynist descriptions reveal that Ryan is not the 
outstanding personality Miller had desired him to be. When Ryan then prompts him to share the 
story of his wife pruning their rose bushes that Miller had alluded to earlier, he says, “No, that 
one I save just for me.” This portrayal of Ryan as a flawed man will motivate the film’s final 
scene, in which he wonders whether he has fulfilled Miller’s last wish. 
Miller’s dying words to Ryan are “James, earn this.” As present-day Ryan travels to 
Miller’s grave, he breaks down and questions whether he has earned Miller’s death with the way 
he has lived his life. This establishes Miller, in spite of the many dead soldiers throughout the 
movie, as the story’s martyr. Metaphorically, he represents the Greatest Generation’s sacrifice 
that 1990s’ audiences are encouraged to earn with their own lives. 
 
Analysis of the Scene 
In a contrast to the film’s conventional narrative and character tropes, the opening battle 
scene represents a mode of engagement unusual for previous WWII films. Using a mode of 
physical engagement, the opening battle scene offers a sense of directness and unmediated access 
to the D-Day participants’ physical sensations. The scene’s visceral realism represents its battle 
primarily in the mode of discomfort and confusion and establishes a continuum between the 
peacetime audience and the soldiers who had to endure this pain.  

 
67 
 
 
The viewer’s discomfort during the opening battle was widely reported in film reviews and 
was a source of pride for DreamWorks, with reports ranging from the inability to talk to physical 
exhaustion. The L.A. Times’ Bill Higgins reports that after the premiere screening, “the audience 
was too shell-shocked to talk. The intensely depicted war scenes, especially the first 25 minutes of 
kinetic carnage, tend to stun viewers into speechlessness” (n.p.). Adam Klinker from the Daily 
Nebraskan interviewed a veteran, who shares that especially opening Omaha landings moved him 
to the point that “I was in no shape to talk . . . [i]t literally put me down to my knees" (n.p.), and 
he had to be hospitalized for PTSD for two weeks as a result of watching the film. DreamWorks 
distribution chief Jim Tharp proudly noted that “in some cases, people exiting the theaters were 
crying. In other cases, they could not initially talk” (Weinraub, n.p.). As my analysis of the opening 
battle scene will show, these experiential narratives and Tharp’s observations are a result of the 
film’s style.  
An antithesis to the narrative opening scene with an older James Ryan, the Omaha Beach 
battle offers a mode of embodied engagement that communicates its ideology by engaging the 
viewer’s body. This engagement is characterized by a viscerality that renders reflection on its 
ideology more challenging. It features the aesthetics of fluid profilmic space, exaggerated or 
filtered sound, crowded blocking, erratic camera movement and expressionist framing. Aiming to 
overwhelm the viewer with disorientation and disgust, the affect is presented as an index, rather 
than as an abstract signifier for the hardship endured by American troops: the viewers are invited 
to respond to the plight of the soldier with a stressful experience of their own. The viewer’s 
potential experience suggests historical authenticity by appropriately mapping the ideology of the 
great sacrifices of the Greatest Generation onto the audience’s bodies. 
 

 
68 
 
 
Disorientation 
The flashback gradually positions itself as a disorienting counterpart to the familiar comfort 
of the opening sequence’s aesthetics. The first shot of 1940s Normandy in the flashback features 
a row of metal anti-tank obstacles (so-called “Czech Hedgehogs”) in an oblique angle (Figure 17), 
which contrasts with the preceding scene’s crosses and their orderly horizontal lines (Figure 18). 
The natural lighting of the opening scene is now exchanged for a heavily desaturated shot. 
Additionally, while a typically Post-Romantic influenced extra-diegetic orchestral score44 
dominated the film’s opening, the flashback scene features only diegetic, often noticeably 
manipulated sounds, beginning with amplified wave noises. As the camera tilts down, the obstacle 
closest to the camera begins diagonally blocking the image’s foreground. Captions announce the 
setting’s date (June 6, 1944) and location (Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach). The trope of 
establishing time and place by means of captions (Figure 17) recalls earlier war films like The 
Longest Day (1962, Figure 20) and A Bridge Too Far (1977, Figure 21), and functions as a 
connector to the opening scene’s narrative conventions. The shot’s oblique angle and amplified 
wave sounds, however, hint at the coming visceral mode of presentation, which aims to induce 
stress (a type of affect with which the players of FPSs are intimately familiar) in the viewer via 
disorienting visuals, sonic amplification and portrayals of physical excess. It sets up an aesthetic 
that, in contrast with the opening scene, disorients the viewer and reduces the distance between 
physical and filmic space by engaging the viewer’s body in its framing (i.e. a disorienting oblique 
angle) and sound editing (i.e. startling amplified wave noises).  
The second shot, a high-angle medium-long crane shot shows a landing craft filled with 
soldiers travelling in the camera’s direction, splashing water toward the lens. This choice of 
                                                
44 Composer John William’s use of chromaticism and dissonance while maintaining Western tonality is typical for 
this period. At the same time, these conventions are typically adopted in Hollywood’s orchestral film scores. 

 
69 
 
 
profilmic space (i.e. the craft’s water splash coming directly at the viewer) serves to induce a 
feeling of immediacy.

Figure 20: The Longest Day (1962) 
Figure 21: A Bridge Too Far (1977) 
 
The next shot, which tracks parallel along a set of landing crafts, features a shaky handheld 
camera (see below) that will remain the dominant form of recording during the battle scene, and 
adds the dimension of camera movement to the scene’s disorienting framing, sound and profilmic 
space. Serving as establishment shots, the images, sounds and captions do introduce event, location 

 
70 
 
 
and time. However, and more importantly, by failing to establish a clear sense of space, they 
continue to establish a framework for reading the landings viscerally. By disorienting and 
overwhelming, the shot introduces a scene that attempts to represent the historical event by 
immersing the viewer in the soldiers’ painful experience, rather than by neutrally documenting it. 
In the following shots, acting and props begin to contribute to this disorienting mode of 
realism. Many anticipate the battle’s viscerality by closely (close-up or medium close up) filming 
the cast as they reenact the breakdown of the soldiers’ exterior and interior, inviting a sensation of 
disgust akin to witnessing the wounded soldiers open bodies a few moments later. These initial 
images show a soldier (later revealed to be Sgt. Hill) pushing a large chunk of chewing tobacco 
into his cheek (Figure 22) two soldiers vomiting close to and toward the camera (Figure 23) and a 
series of close-ups showing the labored breathing of GIs. While contributing to a sense of 
immediacy, the tight framing also adds a sense of claustrophobia. Like the first wave of the Atlantic 
in the opening shot, the vomit directed at the lens brings the viewer in close contact with this 
physical excess, likely inducing a feeling of disgust.

Figure 23: Vomiting 
 
The second the landing crafts are opened (6:25), we see a medium-close up of a soldier 
being shot through his helmet and skull, followed by a graphic shot taken from the back of the 

 
71 
 
 
craft that shows the crowded men being gunned down, body parts flying through the air (Figure 
24). Briefly after (6:53), the hand-held camera follows soldiers dropping over the side of the boat 
under water, as the audio suddenly becomes quiet. In this quietness, the sound of bullets that pierce 
soldiers (Figure 25) becomes muffled. 
 
 
Figure 24: Body Parts 
 
Figure 25: Under Water 
 
As the camera jerks up and down, in and out of the water, the audio shifts back and forth 
between the exaggerated loudness of the beach and the muffled silence below the water surface. 
The camera’s movements and sound imitate the experience of its subjects, the GIs that struggle to 
land on the beach while being weighed down by their backpacks. By emulating the GI experience, 
the entire scene engages the viewer with a stressful visual and sonic whiplash via camera 
movement and sound. 
Contemporary reviews recognized the scene’s realism and its ability to overwhelm viewers 
and suggest a continuum between the audience and the shell-shocked G.I. English scholar Milton 
Cohen reports feedback from both viewers and critics that describe their experience of the film's 
first 25 minutes “as one of spellbound awe for the enormous realism it gives to the D-Day landing 
and for the way the film locates the viewer in the visual action and especially in the deafeningly 
aural chaos of that first day's devastation” (322). Confirming Cohen’s report, Commonweal’s 

 
72 
 
 
Richard Alleva writes that “[the film] almost physically assaults the viewer . . .”, David Denby 
writes in the New York Magazine that “[n]ot just the violence, but the strangeness of [the opening 
battle], is overwhelming,” and in Film & History, film and literature scholar Phil Landon claims 
that “the juxtaposition of brief shots from constantly shifting perspectives creates a sense of 
disorienting immediacy that places viewers among the foundering assault forces” (59). 
Importantly, the concepts of immediacy via disorientation (Landon) and immediacy via the battle’s 
overwhelming violence and strangeness (Denby) is used to describe this widely praised scene.45 
The emphatic acclaim of the battle’s realism can thus not (only) rest on the authentic 
inventory of the profilmic space, such as props, natural sound and acting. Rather, it is precisely in 
the formalist distortions of its representation via unabashedly manipulated sound and image, rapid 
camera movements and expressionist angles that the scene establishes its claims to a realism that 
hinges on representing the soldiers’ own subjective perception of the unique event. My concept of 
visceral realism is thus formalist, yet self-effacing, as it establishes a physical response in the 
viewer that appears appropriate and in its distorted aesthetics alleges to be a non-distorted access 
to historically experienced affect. Beyond disorientation, the battle scene engages the viewer by 
featuring an abundance of bodily excess that is likely to induce disgust. 
 
Disgust 
The battle sequence, which runs for over 20 minutes, is characterized by a large amount of 
blood and gore (Figure 26 and Figure 27) atypical for previous WWII films. Rather, it is 
reminiscent of 1980s’ horror movies that engage the viewers’ bodies with a portrayal of physical 
excess (see my discussion of Williams 1991 below). Figure 28, a screenshot from Videodrome 
                                                
45 See Spielberg (“Saving Private Ryan”), Caldwell, Lane in this chapter’s introduction. 

 
73 
 
 
(1983), and Figure 29, a screenshot from Hellraiser (1987), illustrate this generic heritage by 
showing similarities to Figure 26 and Figure 27, taken from SPR’s opening battle. All four images 
feature a display of the open and the violently deconstructed body respectively.  
 
 
Figure 26: Dying Soldier 
 
Figure 27: An Exploding Body 
 
Figure 28: Videodrome (1983) 
 
Figure 29: Hellraiser (1987) 
 
More importantly for this dissertation, however, these images echo the aesthetics of 1990s 
FPSs, which, while featuring radically different settings and narratives, also use gore to engage 
their players. Wolfenstein 3D (1992, Figure 30) and Doom (1993, Figure 31) both feature killing 
hordes of enemies as the primary engagement with their violent spaces, producing a large number 
of on-screen corpses during gameplay. Although the FPSs mentioned take place in a highly 
fictionalized version of Hitler’s ‘Wolfschanze’ bunker and on one of Mars’ moons respectively, 
the level of gore in SPR is more evocative of those games than of previous WWII films.

Figure 31: Doom (1993) 
 
 
Figure 32: Saving Private Ryan 
 
Figure 33: Call of Duty (2003) 
 
However, it is not only the presence of gore in SPR that emulates the aesthetics of the FPS. 
The reverse shot from the point of view of Nazi troops (Figure 32) with a machine gun in the image 
foreground connects the off-screen shooter to the hostile on-screen objects of violence. In this, 
intentionally or not, the visuals of contemporary FPSs anticipate later WWII themed shooters like 
Call of Duty (Figure 33). As the subject of SPR’s POV long-take from the U.S. perspective never 
shows a gun, the hostile German troops represent the only shots that feature a personified weapon 
as the subject of a POV shot. This reverses the game genre’s fantasies of violent power (see 
Chapter III), and instead aligns the viewer with the hostile subject-as-gun, emphasizing the 
technologically enhanced menace of the Axis powers and — like SPR’s opening battle — causing 
stress and anxiety. 

 
75 
 
 
The subjective long-take, which records the events via an embodied, constantly moving 
camera, performs a similar labor. Imitating the troops’ strategic movements, the camera travels 
from cover to cover, switching between fast horizontal movements and vertical crouching motions. 
As both media attempt to emulate the experience of combat, it might not be surprising that they 
share a similar inventory of visuals and movements. However, given that this embodied camera is 
highly atypical for contemporary and earlier filmic representations of WWII, and that it a defining 
characteristic of the FPS, its use in SPR remains striking. 
As the camera finds Miller, played by the film’s star Tom Hanks, it offers the viewer a 
familiar face within the depersonalized chaos of bodies, once more inviting an identification with 
his character via close-ups (Figure 35).46 Mimicking his state of shock, the audio is reduced to a 
soft hissing noise, while the camera is slowed down to 12 FPS, with every frame printed twice 
during post-production to achieve a jerky, staccato movement on the screen.47 Eye-line matches 
alternately show Miller as he is splattered by blood, his view of soldiers desperately seeking cover, 
an exploding flamethrower that kills several troops, a soldier picking up his severed arm (Figure 
34) and burning men attempting to save themselves by jumping into water. After Miller stares at 
a soldier silently moving his lips (Figure 36), the diegetic sound returns, revealing the dialogue 
and suggesting that Miller’s state of shock has passed. 
 
                                                
46 The close-up as a particularly powerful means for identification has been argued from theorists predating the 
formal inception of film studies (Bálász 1952) to the present (Macdougall 2006, 21). 
47 See Daily Variety interview with SPR’s cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (1999).

Figure 35: Miller in Shock 
 
Figure 36: Miller POV 
 
Miller’s shock, and his inability to effectively use his senses to orient himself on the beach, 
are portrayed by simulating his experiences with a sensory shift in the film’s aesthetics. Rather 
than just visually representing Miller’s state, the manipulated sound and conflict between sound 
(non-representational, quiet) and image (close up of yelling) lets the audience experience it (or at 
the least a visceral representation of it) for themselves. 
The physical sensations the scene aims to induce retroactively come to represent the film’s 
sympathy with and celebration of the hardships of the Greatest Generation by its narrative link to 
the opening and concluding flash forward scenes. The battle sequence is introduced conventionally 
by a shot tracking towards a character’s (here: Ryan’s) eyes, while a sound bridge (amplified wave 
noises) anticipates the sonic space of the flashback before the visuals change to match it. 
Unbeknownst to the viewer, the flashback scene, established by conventional narrative tropes, 
depicts an event—the Omaha beach landings—in which Ryan, who had parachuted to an 

 
77 
 
 
undisclosed Normandy location, did not participate. Why, then, does the film track towards Ryan’s 
eyes, if it is not showing his memory, as the filmic conventions appear to indicate? The answer 
lies in the final scene, in which Ryan, back in the post-war present, asks his wife if he had lived 
up to Miller’s plea for him to “Earn it,” i.e. his death: “Tell me I have led a good life. Tell me I’m 
a good man.” As the film’s dialogue links Miller’s plea to Ryan’s self-evaluation at the end of the 
film, the portrayal of D-Day—and other events Ryan did not participate in—reveals itself not to 
be merely a flashback, but rather a representation of the film’s primary message, located in Ryan’s 
body, i.e. his physical intactness. By retroactively altering a potential reading of SPR’s opening 
scene—from conventional narrative bracket to a key to the ideological substance of the film’s 
visceral experience—Spielberg highlights the Greatest Generation’s hardships and sacrifices by 
echoing the contemporary discourse mentioned above. In my reading of the film, which was shared 
by many reviewers (see below), the final scene indicates that younger generations should 
appreciate their freedom as something that was hard won for them and has to be earned by living 
a meaningful life. The squad’s effort to save Private Ryan becomes a metonymy for the U.S. 
military’s effort to retain the liberty of future generations. 
Thus, the ideology surrounding the Greatest Generation and its meaning motivate the film’s 
representations of their struggles and achievements as portrayed in the opening D-Day battle 
sequence. The battle assaults the viewer with a stressful physical experience and establishes just 
how extreme these soldiers’ sacrifices were by inviting the viewer to fluidly identify with both 
their suffering and their underlying heroism. As it strives to approximate an experiential continuum 
between audience and portrayed soldier, the realism rests on how well it can implicitly 
communicate Miller’s request to the audience by conveying some of the physical sensations the 
soldiers experienced, even though this request is only made explicit at the end of the film. 

 
78 
 
 
Regardless of intent, the continuum, like all conceptions of filmic realism, constitutes an 
abstraction and an aesthetic language, rather than a neutral transmission of physical sensation from 
screen subject to film viewer. The viewer’s physical discomfort represents, rather than neutrally 
transports the physical sensations of the soldier. As a result, it remains a system of signification: 
the signifier is located in the physical sensation of the signified battle experience within a system 
which performs its own ideological labor. 
 
Visceral Realism 
Viscerality 
Critics have praised the film’s opening battle for a perceived directness in its representation 
of history, which appears as non-mediated reality, rather than as a formally constructed narrative 
work. Freelance journalist Christopher Caldwell speaks of a critical consensus of praise for “[its] 
brilliantly realistic depiction of the D-day invasion of Europe . . .” (48). Contemporary reviews 
confirm Caldwell’s summary, as critics repeatedly praise SPR’s realism and directness, which they 
claim is located outside both the conventions of its genre and those of its production period. New 
Yorker critic Anthony Lane somewhat naïvely calls the film’s opening battle a successful attempt 
in making a “film that doesn’t look like a film” (77), while his colleague Hendrik Hertzberg 
declares in the same journal that SPR will “never be mistaken for an action-adventure film” (32), 
giving it a place outside of the conventions of genre filmmaking. Finally, in a Film Comment 
review, co-editor Richard Jameson describes it as “untainted by anything suggesting a Nineties 
sensibility” (21), untouched by its historical and cultural environment, rather than being an 
expression of its own time. These sources would suggest a consensus of critics who believed that 
Spielberg achieved his desired effect. The director explained in an interview with Andrew Levy 

 
79 
 
 
for the Director’s Guild of America (DGA) magazine the he wanted to create a film with “violent 
honesty” (Spielberg, “Saving Private Ryan” 68).  
Several statements about historical authenticity, realism, conventionality and immersion 
manifest themselves in the discourse surrounding SPR. Not unexpectedly, most important is the 
notion of a particular realist style that is tied to historical authority. However, its idea extends 
beyond the employment of the conventions of traditional realist cinematic style. Rather, this 
realism appears contingent on the idea that the medium of film, its operative categories like genre, 
and its formative processes influenced by its contemporary historical and cultural circumstances 
need to become invisible so that the audience can establish a more direct, and thus quasi-objective, 
access to the depicted events. In other words, this realist style can be understood as an immersion 
into the world of the film, or, as framed by the opening scene, into the ideology of celebrating the 
sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. The gory display of physical excess, usually associated with 
genre films, becomes “honesty” in this iteration of realist style. It now serves as a marker for 
visceral realism by striving for an experiential continuum with the military subject by using the 
excesses of what feminist film scholar Linda Williams has named the “body genres” (1991), rather 
than a style that attempts a less embodied reaction.  
In this dissertation I use visceral realism to describe a mode in which a specific medium 
engages a viewer’s (or player’s) body. This mode allows to experience the medium in a virtually 
embodied fashion beyond visual and acoustic cues and, most importantly, with less opportunity 
for reflection. The mode of visceral realism epistemologically differs from those of other viscerally 
engaging genres (such as what feminist film scholar Linda Williams named the “body genres”) in 
its context. Visceral realism’s  use suggests that experiencing an approximation of the physical 
sensations that are portrayed on screen unlocks a type of knowledge that would be unobtainable 

 
80 
 
 
by other means of signification. In this way, the address of the body stakes a claim to a type of 
pedagogy. Its realism rests on its alleged ability to reveal a type of ‘truth’ (i.e. its ideology) not 
obtainable by less embodied representations.  
Like Linda Williams (cf. chapter I), I am suspicious of this perception, a distrust which 
stems from the assumption that mechanisms of filmic identification are more complicated than—
in the case of horror—a mere sadistic loss of the self in the killer’s pleasures or a masochistic 
identification with the victim: “[E]ven in the most extreme displays of feminine masochistic 
suffering, there is always a component of either power or pleasure for the woman victim” (8), she 
claims, and argues that even the genre of sadomasochistic pornography offers “a strong mixture 
of [feminine] passivity and [masculine] activity, and a bisexual oscillation between the poles of 
each” (ibid). I find this nuanced view of analyzing bodily engaging media to be a more helpful 
tool for my framework of visceral realism. It allows for the multiplicity of viewer experiences 
necessary to read SPR’s opening battle scene and features many elements which, in other contexts, 
had been decried for their sensationalism or pornographic violence.48  
However, the idea of a spectrum of viewer experiences also offers a broad range of 
identification—from the masochistic (if not exactly passive) suffering of the G.I. to the active (if 
not exactly sadistic) identification with their heroism. Here lies the relevance of the SPR’s opening 
sequence in the graveyard with its conventional inventory (flag, cemetery, etc.) of “Greatest 
Generation” ideology: the perception of realism rests upon the double-address of the soldier; both 
in empathy with their struggle and celebration of their heroism. Moreover, the physical experience 
of the depicted events hides its own ideological function—it suggests a moment of embodied 
witnessing beyond the coded cinematic language that engages us via vision, hearing, and touch. 
                                                
48 In fact, even in Spielberg’s film, some critics have found these elements to be  

 
81 
 
 
Film scholar Jennifer Barker suggests that an experience based on viscerality can work to 
obscure a medium’s underlying ideology. In her 2009 book The Tactile Eye: Touch and the 
Cinematic Experience, Barker touches on the concerns of physically embedded ideology by 
exploring a relationship between the ‘viscera of the film’—her metaphor for the cinematic 
apparatus of exhibition—and that of the audience. “Films appeal to the more immediately 
accessible musculature and skin, inviting their participation in a way that invokes the temporal 
rhythms of the viewer’s viscera,” (128) she claims, connecting film’s temporal structure to the 
rhythm of humans’ inner works, such as the heartbeat. Both film and human inner workings present 
themselves as continuous motions, with the micro-processes of the projector and of the human 
heart largely escaping our attention when functioning properly. Awareness of a process, of course, 
is a basic prerequisite for the ability to reflect on it. Her suggestion that viewing a film can engage 
the viewer in ways that emerge from the senses, but possess an impact that extends beyond them, 
constitutes a useful metaphor for the ways that physically engaging (by means of excess or 
otherwise) representations can transport ideology in an untangleable way from ‘real’ physical 
experience.  
My model of visceral realism is one that similarly hides its ideology deep within our bodies 
by presenting the affect it induces as concrete indices, rather than abstract signifiers of the 
sensations experienced at D-Day. This is to argue that audiences can remain aware of the formalist, 
representational nature of the film without critically reflecting on their “gut feeling,” especially 
given that the representation of the opening battle openly manipulates the ‘guts’ of the film, as in 
the portrayal of Miller’s shock by the manipulation of sound and recording speed. Such a claim 
fails to adequately consider the viewer’s active role in experiencing a film. Rather, the 

 
82 
 
 
disorientation and physical stress caused by these manipulations constitute the scene’s most inner 
and most inaccessible ideological space, not the aesthetic language on its surface. 
Contemporary reviewers and scholars have recognized the battle scene’s intention to 
overwhelm viewers: English scholar Milton Cohen reports a feedback from both viewers and 
critics that describe the film's first twenty-five minutes, or rather, their experience of it, as one of 
spellbound awe for the enormous realism it gives to the D-Day landing by locating the viewer in 
the visual action and especially in the deafeningly aural chaos of that first day's devastation (322). 
As it stimulates the senses of vision and hearing, the film can bring about an elusive sense of 
presence. 
Saving Private Ryan’s innovations in its construction of realism lie in its adaptation of body 
genre conventions (Williams). It introduces an aesthetic framework typically external to the war 
movie genre. These extra-generic conventions, as I argue, appear as external to narrative 
conventions. As a result, their engagement of the body appears as a non-mediated experiential 
continuum between viewer and the depicted event’s witnesses, authenticating the film’s 
historiography. Additionally, the introduction of body genre conventions clashes with the scene’s 
subject matter, breaking down the generic coherence of aesthetics and setting in the film’s opening. 
As this clash amplifies the viewer’s disorientation, it adds to the suggestion of an experiential 
continuum with the depicted confused soldiers. 
Contemporary takes on SPR’s aesthetics confirm Williams’ claim that spectacular and 
bodily engaging film genres did not enjoy cultural recognition during the 1990s. In his review, 
Hertzberg associates these strategies with “mindless spectacle”: 
Spielberg takes (and enlarges) an arsenal of filmmaking techniques that have been 
developed mostly in the service of sensation and mindless spectacle (the fireballs, the blood 
bags, the gory prostheses, the plastic and animal viscera, the earsplitting, digitally enhanced 

 
83 
 
 
noise) and turns it toward a quite different purpose - authenticity, in the re-creation of a 
great and terrible historical episode (31). 
 
Similarly, in his review, film journalist Richard Combs calls the opening battle “more grim 
carnival than documentary” (50). 
Reclaiming these ostracized strategies in the service of representing a sacred moment in 
American history might at first seem counterintuitive. However, it is exactly D-Day’s sacredness 
that reframes the filmic techniques as markers for visceral realism. A 1990s discourse that had 
sanctified WWII veterans via their unfathomable sacrifices set up a mode of understanding history 
marked by embracing the radical difference to non-veterans’ own civilian lives. SPR taps into this 
mode, using the categories of excess and physically overwhelming its audience to illustrate this 
difference in a visceral fashion: it appears to show the historic experience via radical difference 
with present peace-time United States, a juxtaposition represented via the film’s openly 
conventional moments. 
Four years before the release of SPR, the 50th anniversary of D-Day had rekindled a 
reference to WWII and its soldiers across the U.S., which was intensified by the failure of the Cold 
War to become a new source of national pride.49 English and American Studies scholar Catherine 
Gunther Kodat describes the cultural climate surrounding the production and release of SPR by 
recalling “the tidal wave of World War II nostalgia that had been activated by the anniversary of 
D-Day . . . and had not yet completely subsided by the time of Saving Private Ryan's release” (90).  
Reverence for the soldiers’ sacrifice and suffering constituted a central facet of this 
nostalgia. It resurfaces throughout the film’s narrative, establishing a pattern that goes beyond its 
employment of body genre aesthetics. Contrasting himself with the heroic figure of Captain Miller 
                                                
49 Rogin 17.

(Tom Hanks), Spielberg explains how he identified with the figure of the cowardly anti-hero 
Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies): “I'm not sure I would ever be able to withstand what 
a lot of those guys did for us 54 years ago. I'm not sure I would've been able to take it . . . I used 
Upham to kind of voice how I would have reacted in similar situations” (Spielberg, “Saving Private 
Ryan” 73). The representation of a sacrifice, the horrors of which would be impossible for the 
postwar viewer to recreate, emerges from the nostalgia and reverence mentioned above. What is 
signified by the film’s visceral realism is thus the feeling of being overwhelmed, horrified and 
unable to imagine oneself as acting heroically in the intensity of battle, as signified by the scene’s 
aesthetics. Adding to the experience of unmediated history, ironically, is the simulation of 1940s’ 
recording equipment and aesthetics, as well as the reenactment of the battles’ soundscapes. 
The Archive Effect and the Emulation of Historical Recording Technology 
In a Newsweek piece, Spielberg references a major motivation for creating the film: “I 
wanted to make the kind of war film about which a veteran of Omaha Beach might remark, ‘This 
is pretty close to what it was like’” (Spielberg, “Of Guts and Glory” 68). His explicit connection 
between the witness and the scene’s resulting testimonial authority likely only meaningfully 
influenced the film’s cinematic experience in rare cases. However, the simulation of historical 
imagery informs the movie’s visual language, and uses the authority of the past witness to suggest 
a presence in the past event in SPR. As I will show, Spielberg emulates historical film recording 
technology and references the imagery of war photographer Robert Capa. As a result, he inserts 
the recorded perspective of participants in the battle into his film and aligns the photographer-
witness with his audience. 

 
85 
 
 
Spielberg filmed SPR in an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, rather than using wider images 
conventionally employed to add to its genre’s epic nature.50 Doherty claims that Spielberg chose 
a narrower image in order to “avoid associations with the glory mongering WWII spectacles of 
the Fifties and Sixties” (70). In hindsight, it would be naïve to agree with the suggestion that SPR 
surpasses former WWII films by reducing any conceptual suggestions. A break with former visual 
WWII conventions may very well suggest the wish not to employ former vessels of ideology. As 
I have shown, however, the film is far from ideologically neutral. More importantly, the opening 
battle’s style emulates 1940s recording technology,51 the aesthetics of which were defined by both 
technological and cultural circumstances. Spielberg’s inspiration by famed war photographer 
Robert Capa52 becomes clear in a direct comparison of their images (Figure 37 to Figure 42). Both 
feature a grainy quality, and a nearly identical record of their ‘prophotographic’ or profilmic space 
respectively. 
                                                
50 While a few other WWII battle films like Cross of Iron (1977) and The Big Red One (1980) had used the ratio of 
1.85:1, most had chosen a wider image: The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), The Longest Day (1962), The Great 
Escape (1963) and A Bridge Too Far (1977) were all shot in 2.35:1, while The Battle of the Bulge (1965) used a 
ratio as large as 2.76:1. 
51 One critic comparing the opening battle’s shaky handheld cameras to contemporary newsreels is Newsweek’s 
David Ansen (52). 
52 “Probably the things that informed me more than anything else were those surviving snapshots of Omaha Beach 
taken by the famous war photojournalist Robert Capa” (Spielberg, “Saving Private Ryan” 69).

Figure 39: Capa II 
 
Figure 40: Capa in SPR II 
 
Figure 41: Capa III 
 
Figure 42: Capa in SPR III 
 
Beyond referencing the work of Capa, Spielberg also simulates the historical recording 
technology of the 1940s:  
[W]hen I analyzed [combat] footage, I discovered that a lot of those old cameras that were 
being used by the Signal Corps had 45-degree shutters. A 45- or 90-degree shutter 
eradicates blurring, and it made the image look so neurotic and chaotic and panic-stricken, 
that I thought this is the way I needed to shoot every combat scene in Saving Private Ryan. 
(71) 
 
The simulation of historical film recording techniques in the battle scene evokes a quasi-
archival quality that underlines the temporal distance between audience and historical subjects, a 
distance that leads to what film scholar Jamie Baron (2014) calls the archive effect. As she argues 

 
87 
 
 
in her book by that title, archival material (or, as it appears in SPR, its simulation), produces 
temporal disparity between the then and the now (21). By simulating said images, a medium can 
be perceived as an object from the past, carrying the authority of the witness. 
While Spielberg’s references to the aesthetics of archival documents produce a sense of 
authenticity, the film’s sound design does not attempt to reinforce this archival effect but achieves 
its authority via a fetishistic re-enactment of the combat’s soundscape itself, rather than its 
recording methods. Spielberg had his sound crew fire tens of thousands of bullets past microphones 
in order to capture the ‘real’ sound of battle: 
I got these wonderful sound guys, real computer nerds, so fetishistic about it they even 
made sure they fired off the right sort of German ammo  . . . These guys fired the ammo 
into sand, into dirt, into mortar, into a mess kit, into meat. They got half a cow from a 
slaughterhouse and fired into that. They put a uniform on an actual half a cow, to get the 
sound of bullets going through clothes into flesh. (2) 
 
 Spielberg’s mention of “computer nerds” seems at odds with their decidedly analogue, non-virtual 
methods of producing profilmic sound, rather than referencing its recordings. His use of the term 
likely refers to modern technologies of capturing these sounds, which would present a stark 
contrast to the fetishism found in the recording of the battle’s visuals. It is this fetishism of 
production, rather than capture, that establishes the sound event as reenactment. Even before 
becoming integrated into the film, this event becomes its own signifier of WWII sound: it attempts 
to produce, rather than re-produce, original historical recordings. 
Saving Private Ryan’s image and sound thus suggests an authentic experience of history 
by (re-)producing its visual and sonic environment in two different ways. The visuals evoke 
historic recording equipment and its resulting images, infusing the filmmaker with the trust of the 
documentarian via archive effect and affect by offering the audience a visual framework associated 

 
88 
 
 
with directness. Its sound design, on the other hand, uses modern technology to capture the sounds 
of reenacted battle, rather than those of seminal recordings, by using historic guns and bullets. 
 
Conclusion 
In this chapter I have explored Saving Private Ryan’s tensions between familiar narrative 
convention and disrupting shifts of visceral genre tropes, the evocation of historical footage via 
the archive effect and its resulting affect, the production of quasi-historical image and sound, and 
the film’s opportunities for identification that hinge on Upham and Miller. All these elements recall 
contemporary views of the Greatest Generation, linking the film to their great suffering and reasons 
for celebrating them. I have explored these elements to analyze the film’s strategies of 
authentication that have given its representation of history and its underlying ideology a sense of 
authority. SPR’s play with narrative body genres and use of FPS conventions motivates its 
viscerally engaging moments, while the use of the archive effect stakes a claim to historical realism 
in a nostalgic nod to historical imagery and recording technology. These are the central aspects of 
its realist style that infuses the film with trust in its representations. 
In Chapter III, I will use these categories of subjective viscerality and allegedly objective 
attention to historical media to explore the impact Medal of Honor (1999), a FPS that was largely 
seen as an adaptation of SPR (see reception overview in chapter III), had on the representation of 
WWII. Being released within a year of SPR, I argue that both works noticeably engaged with their 
digital cultural context by shifting representational authority from the indexical to the visceral.

CHAPTER III: 
Medal of Honor (1999): Virtual Violence and Its Ideological Redemption in History 
 
As early as its first mission briefing, Medal of Honor’s (1999) player-character Patterson 
is presented as a heroic, highly competent individual, and as such, a perfect fit for the game’s 
mission. By introducing Patterson in the context of a rigid historical space marked by 
contemporary technology and a recursive sequence of frames, MoH offers the player a highly 
desirable point of identification. This increases immersion on a diegetic level—being “caught up 
in the world of the game’s story” (McMahan, 68), while also establishing a subject position that 
frames the ensuing gameplay as located in the past. 
The film sequence that introduces Air Force Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson to his first 
mission features a voice-over by the character Colonel Hargrove addressing Patterson, and—by 
extension—the player. Hargrove is from the Office of Strategic Service, the intelligence branch 
of the US Military that would later become the CIA. He acknowledges that, while Patterson 
considers himself “just another anonymous pilot in the transport corps,” his heroic actions, 
specifically “taking out a half a dozen of the Wehrmacht and then sneaking back into friendly 
territory,” had made him a desirable candidate for recruitment by the OSS, whose missions, as 
Hargrove explains, include “[e]spionage, sabotage, subversion, search and rescue--you name it, 
we do it.” The player is thus introduced to Patterson’s already extraordinary life at the beginning 
of the game, underlining his exceptional ‘out of the box’ heroism.  

 
90 
 
 
Other games’ player-characters, e.g. those featured in Call of Duty (2003), frequently 
require training that serves to introduce the player to the game’s controls and follow the player-
character’s rise to competence. Alternatively, Wolfenstein 3D’s (1992) B.J. Blazkovicz or 
Doom’s (1993) nameless protagonist are thrown into their battles by sheer accident, being 
captured or invaded by enemy forces. Patterson does not need to acquire any particular skills 
before gameplay commences, nor is he blind-sided by an attack that forces him to engage. 
Rather, he is chosen because he is a perfect fit for the missions at the game’s inception. This 
difference is relevant for his construction as an ideal player-character, which allows for a fantasy 
of empowerment on the part of the player that, in its suggestion of agency—the sense that “the 
things we do bring tangible results” (Murray, 126)—functions as an important aspect of 
immersed gameplay. 
As I have shown in chapter II, the release of Spielberg’s 1998 film Saving Private Ryan 
shifted the acceptance of bodily engagement in mainstream Hollywood war cinema. While 
physically engaging film had long been poorly regarded by critics (Williams 1991), audiences’ 
visceral responses to SPR did not result in its critical dismissal but were rather regarded as a way 
to unlock a particular truth about the experience of the war veterans it depicted. The film 
combined its viscerality with attention to historical material culture that can result in the archive 
effect, a term coined by Jamie Baron (2014, see also Chapter II). By including or simulating 
archival material like historical film sequences, Baron argues, fictional works can be imbued 
with the authority of the witness.  
The combination of viscerality with a foregrounding of historical material culture 
constitutes what I have called the mode of visceral realism. This mode fuses the documentary’s 
rhetoric of disengaged objectivity with the subjective immediacy of what Linda Williams (1991) 

 
91 
 
 
terms body genres and the FPS and serves as a new way of claiming historical authenticity, by 
introducing the audience’s physical engagement as a category. Like SPR’s viscerality, the FPS’s 
immersive qualities have been (and remain) understood as a feature that minimizes the distance 
between player and the game’s diegesis. 
Typically, historical authenticity has resulted from employing tropes from former 
iterations of historical representations, or, as Salvati and Bullinger (2013) put it, “a chain of 
signifiers assembled from historical texts, artifacts, and popular representations of World War II” 
(154). Chapman (2018) notes that “framing something as history in certain ways within popular 
culture can carry a particular authority” (36). It is this authority that sets Medal of Honor apart 
from former iterations of the FPS genre. The gameplay’s physical engagement via immersion, 
rather than a source for concern, attaches itself to a history-based narrative that distinguishes it 
from games like Doom. 
In this chapter, I continue to explore the shifting public perception of physically engaging 
media that represent WWII in the historical context of the late 1990 and early 2000s. I argue that 
the 1999 genre-hybrid Medal of Honor represents the central moment, in which FPSs engaged 
SPR’s critical acclaim by tethering its violently immersive gameplay to concrete representations 
of what was then widely discussed as heroism within America’s past. As a result, the game 
effectively distanced itself from moral anxieties about the genre’s former iterations in a way that 
contributed to its culture-wide acceptance and economic success. 
 First, Medal of Honor’s thematic connection to WWII allowed its makers to present the 
game as an ideologically sound experience by participating in a post-1994 discourse that 
highlighted the “Greatest Generation’s” war efforts. This rhetoric was especially present during 
the 50th anniversary celebrations of D-Day, a discourse that I have described in relation to Saving 

 
92 
 
 
Private Ryan in Chapter II. Guy Westwell discusses this period in his book War Cinema: 
Hollywood on the Front Line (2006): “The 1994 anniversary of the D-Day landings…had 
triggered a more general cultural fascination with World War II” (90, see also Chapter II), he 
explains, adding that “[i]n the political rhetoric of presidential speeches, the endlessly-looped 
television documentaries, and the nonfiction books dominating the bestseller lists” (90). In the 
1990s, WWII was constructed as the nation’s communal effort to overcome barbarism.  
Using the archive effect, the game’s employment of historical artifacts and technology 
gives the appearance of educational materials that framed gameplay through menus and cut-
scenes.53 By locating MoH in a specific historical time and space, these moments establish the 
violent gameplay’s presence in the domestic sphere as less of a moral threat in the wake of the 
Columbine massacre: the player-character was part of the allied WWII efforts, and as such, his 
violence was warranted and clearly isolated from the present unlike the fictional characters of 
earlier FPSs. The reputation of Steven Spielberg, acting as a producer on the game, only 
heightened the perception that the game made an authentic use of what Adam Chapman (2018) 
calls past time.  
While the relationship between game time and real time had been explored at length as 
early as 2001,54 it was Chapman who used Jesper Juul’s (2005) concepts of play time—the time 
spent playing the game—and fictional time—the time shown to have passed in the game 
diegesis—and integrated these concepts into a framework of historical representation, adding the 
third category of past time. Chapman uses this term to mean the way historical games present 
time “as it is claimed to have appeared to agents” (91). I will use his terminology and especially 
                                                
53 See my discussion of Tanine Allison (2018) below 
54 Wolf, 85-88 

 
93 
 
 
the concept of past time throughout this chapter to discuss the distinction of player actions and 
player-character actions. 
Second, by basing its design on the James Bond Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye007 (1997) 
evoking the genre of the spy thriller, MoH’s violent gameplay appeared within a familiar, 
accepted framework while Nintendo’s reputation as a child-friendly platform contributed to this 
notion. As I will explore below, this reputation had been bolstered by a public discourse around 
the senate hearings concerning the subject of video game violence. 
 
Historical Background 
Medal of Honor was designed between 1997 and 1999, and its focus on clandestine 
warfare reflected these years’ U.S.-foreign policies, cultural environment, and the PlayStation’s 
technological limitations. Responding to these contemporary aspects allowed the game to not 
only obtain a level of relevance, but to distance itself from issues that were typically associated 
with the FPS in the 1990s. 
The U.S. administration under President Bill Clinton during the mid-late 1990s used 
increasingly aggressive foreign policy, rather than military actions, in their conflicts with hostile 
countries. America’s use of indirect warfare via espionage and technological sabotage resulted in 
a cultural environment that could be emulated in a ‘lone wolf’ stealth type of game setting, while 
also allowing the depictions of violence to be characterized by ‘clean’ individual killings, rather 
than Doom’s (1993) gory piles of bodies (Error! Reference source not found.). Clinton’s a
dministration imposed economic sanctions to intervene in the nuclear tests of India and Pakistan 
in May 1998 and in the Kosovo conflict, chose to destabilize the Milosevic regime by using 
cyber-attacks against the government rather than sending in ground troops, as had been 
demanded by U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair. The findings of the May 1999 Cox Report 

 
94 
 
 
revealed to the public that this type of warfare extended to actions against the U.S. as well: it 
reported two episodes of systematic nuclear espionage by China against the U.S. over the course 
of two decades. Finally, the Iraq Disarmament Crisis was, at this point, still shaped by politics of 
containment, rather than George W. Bush’s post-9/11 pursuit of preemptive military action. 
 
Figure 43: Doom (1993) 
At home, the April 1999 Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, CO renewed 
anxieties about the violent impulses of youth cultures, popular music, film and video games, 
specifically the FPS Doom (1993). Eric Harris, one of the two Columbine shooters, was reported 
to be an enthusiast of the game, had designed levels in his free time, and referenced being 
preoccupied with the game in his personal writings.55  Dirk Johnson and James Brooke report in 
the NYT that Eric Harris was “an avid player of Doom and Quake” (April 22, 1999). The 
Washington Post calls him a “fan of the original [sic] shoot-em-up game Doom . . . Using special

95 
 
 
software, he created new levels filled with monsters for players to blast their way through” (April 
22, 1999). These sources illustrate how video games had become associated with school 
shootings. As I will show, Medal of Honor largely avoided being grouped with the negatively 
discussed earlier FPSs by providing a unique historical subject position that extended to texts 
like its printed strategy guide. It also attached itself to Steven Spielberg’s reputation and 
cinematic work and emulated the N64 game GoldenEye007. 
The technological inability of the PlayStation to dynamically depict warfare in which 
large numbers of allied and hostile soldiers were engaged in conflict thus found a welcome 
political environment. This allowed it to focus on missions characterized by stealth that created 
its own ideology of American exceptionalism and spread out its depictions of violence across the 
virtual space. Regardless of its makers’ intentions, I argue that the game as a historical artifact 
reflected contemporary foreign policies and responded to public concerns about school violence. 
Unlike other academic sources that provide broader histories of the WWII FPS genre, 
focusing on 1999’s Medal of Honor means not contextualizing the game in the United States’ 
post-9/11 political and cultural shift. Tanine Allison argues in her 2018 book Destructive 
Sublime. World War II in American Film and Media that the rise of the WWII military shooter 
coincided with the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were increasingly theorized as 
‘post-heroic’ and executed from a distance, rather than by sending ground troops (158). As a 
result, she claims that these shooters answered the nostalgic longing for a conflict characterized 
by ethical clarity and conventional warfare. While her fruitful analyses proved that framing the 
history of the WWII FPS genre as a whole as largely a post-9/11 phenomenon can provide clear 
and helpful insights, my own analysis cannot be productively framed in this fashion. Rather, I 
illustrate how the military FPS genre’s rise in popularity began before 2001. This allows my own 

 
96 
 
 
analysis to draw attention to MoH and to add specificity to existing broader accounts. It is 
especially Medal of Honor’s reactions to cultural anxieties and its resulting contributions to the 
genre’s rise in acceptance that constitute a blind spot in academic literature. Attention to those 
dynamics will allow me to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the genre’s history, 
while also drawing attention to the interplay of design choices and public discourse. 
Unlike later military shooters like 2003’s Call of Duty (cf. Chapter IV), Medal of Honor’s 
clandestine missions framed WWII as a ‘war from a distance’ in its own right. Jimmy Patterson, 
the game’s protagonist, does not anticipate the country’s later cultural environment of 
disembodied warfare from afar, but emerges from the same discourse as Saving Private Ryan 
that celebrated the Greatest Generation in the wake of the 50th anniversary of D-Day (see chapter 
II). Rather than the film’s evocations of the Greatest Generation, who saved the democratic 
world’s freedom by suffering a great deal, the game, as a hybrid of the spy thriller and the 
military shooter, highlights the WWII hero as a highly competent and brave individual, as 
opposed to an often overwhelmed collective. Patterson’s physical discomfort, emulated by the 
vibrating PlayStation controller, contributes to the player’s virtually embodied experience of the 
game, giving its diegesis violent agency and thus contributing to a sense of embodied presence 
beyond its visual and auditory design. 
 
Controversy 
 
The genre’s public perception and press coverage at the time of MoH’s release point to an 
increase in public anxieties focused on the FPS. Many groups feared that FPSs’ engagement of 
the player, particularly its use of perspective that conflates the view of the player with that of the 
player-character, would translate to non-virtual acts of violence. This illustrates that the genre’s 

 
97 
 
 
perceived close relationship with their players’ bodies still rendered them ‘bad objects’, and 
prompted the creators of Medal of Honor to distance themselves from these earlier FPSs. 
In 1994, the Washington Post’s Dave Nuttycombe claimed that players of FPSs, then also 
known as “Doom clones” (Arsenault 2009, 164-65), inscribed their virtual experiences on the 
players’ bodies: “Like a day spent on the ocean, a long stretch of Doom-playing can leave the 
synapses of the brain still racing to its rhythms” (10/10/1994, n.p.). By the time of Medal of 
Honor’s development, the connections between ‘real-world’ violence and FPSs had become a 
focus of the genre’s coverage outside of gaming journalism. NextGeneration’s speculation that 
DreamWorks Interactive chose to miss the chance of marketing their upcoming game at the E3 
trade show “because they didn’t want to fall victim themselves to the violence hounding TV 
crews” (July 1999, 14)56 illustrates this conflation of virtual and non-virtual violence during the 
time’s press coverage. The article’s polemic criticism of “violence hounding” journalists also 
shows the defensive position players and publishers of FPSs found themselves in, as the 
perceived aggression of “hounding” rhetorically marks the journalists, rather than FPSs, as 
agents of violence. 
As I will show now, Medal of Honor countered the perception of the FPS and the 
anxieties centered around its virtual acts of violence by constructing a unique subject position in 
its mission briefs and cut-scenes. I argue that by using a dual address of both the player and their 
player-character, MoH grounds gameplay and its virtual violent actions in a rigid historical 
frame. 
 
                                                
56 While the genre of the FPS was particularly scrutinized as a possible trigger for real-life violence, it needs to be 
noted that the non-FPS fighting game Mortal Kombat (1992) had been subject to similar, equally well documented 
controversies.

The double address of player and soldier--the historical and the domestic space 
By using the double address of soldier and player via aesthetics, control interfaces and 
narrative, MoH frames virtually violent gameplay in the game’s historical narrative. The “archive 
effect,” a term I borrow from film and media scholar Jamie Baron’s eponymous 2014 book, 
limits the conflict as one of historical reenactment, only the “Greatest Generation” ideology of 
which, but not its violence, extends to the present. As a result, the game manages to historically 
contain its violently immersive experience. This frame, unlike former explicitly fictional FPSs, 
allows MoH’s virtual violence to be safely displaced from the domestic sphere, which I argue 
contributed to the growing social acceptance of the FPS genre in the late-1990s. While one might 
rightly argue that this double address conversely transports historical violence into the present 
domestic sphere, it still distinguishes the game from earlier FPSs, like Doom, that had an openly 
fictional diegesis, the violence of which did not permit them to be seen as contained in the past. 
 
The Archive Effect  
MoH’s cutscenes, loading screens, and gameplay combine virtual spaces with the 
materiality of manufactured quasi-historical artifacts, the aesthetics of which engage the material 
culture of the game’s historical setting. The combination of diegetic and non-diegetic elements 
does not by itself constitute a new component (Wolf, 83). It is, rather, MoH’s diegesis which is 
grounded in realistic re-creations of the past that constitutes a novel element. While the game’s 
gameplay suggests a spatial continuum between player and player-character via the subjective 
point of view, in which Patterson’s eyes function as a virtual camera, these artifacts integrate 
play time into the game’s historical diegesis. 
Baron analyzes this new type of non-textual, quasi-archival artifact primarily in its 
“experience of reception” (7, italics in original). She refers to this experience as the “archive 

 
99 
 
 
effect,” which produces a relationship between elements of a medium and its audience via the 
suggestion of temporal disparity. Baron focuses on film-based representations, yet, even MoH’s 
still images, while clearly constructed, rather than indexically reproducing historical materials, 
serve to ground the game in its historical narrative and setting. Baron discusses the manufacture 
of ‘historical’ images that replicate the archive effect via the open manipulation of documentary 
footage (in films like Forrest Gump (50)), or the adaptation of visuals that evoke the archive 
effect (the newsreel opening to Citizen Kane (52)) without hiding their manipulation.57 As I will 
show, while it does not use the language of documentary film, MoH’s constant evocation of 
historical material culture outside of gameplay serves as ‘evidentiary values’ that restrict it to 
historical reenactment and binds its virtual violence to the fictional, ideologically untouchable 
past agent Patterson, rather than the player. As a result, the physically engaging, because 
immersive, gameplay of Medal of Honor redeems the FPS’s focus on violence by grounding it in 
‘authentic’ history. 
Film and media scholar Tanine Allison has noted other examples of isolated use of 
historical material in her 2018 book Destructive Sublime, claiming that in WWII themed games 
like MoH, it is due to the game world’s inability to indexically replicate physical space that the 
archival footage outside of gameplay performs the labor of providing documentary ‘truth’: 
“[T]he video games carefully deposit archival footage outside of the playable game world. The 
archival images can provide context but are placed securely in the past…” (169) It is this space, 
located “securely in the past,” that, I argue, produces MoH’s claims to historical accuracy. While 
Allison finds that “the gameplay in virtual landscapes … gives the impression of unfolding for 
                                                
57 The death of Charles Foster Kane is no more presented as a historical truth than Forrest Gump’s meetings with 
John F Kennedy and John Lennon, but rather as self-aware hinges between history and fiction, in which the archive 
effect functions diegetically, rather than making claims about historical facts. 

 
100 
 
 
the player in real time, in the now,” the use of the archive effect outside of gameplay marks it as 
historical reenactment. It does certainly occur in the present, but its violence is still clearly 
marked as a virtual play within the game’s construction of the past. 
I find that archival images in Medal of Honor and the simulation of archival-ness in 
created images function in ways that speak to Allison’s analysis and that counteract anxieties 
about FPSs. First, as they provide a sense of “documentary ‘truth’,” these images establish 
themselves as a source of information about the past, attaching themselves to educational claims 
associated with the documentary film genre. Second, their position “securely in the past” 
underlines the ‘past-ness’ of the game diegesis, displacing their violent actions from their 
domestic environment in the present. Both these elements ultimately serve to distinguish MoH 
from earlier FPSs, whose problematic reputation was reinforced by a discourse on media 
violence after the Columbine shootings.  
Both the mission instructions by character Manon Batiste and the following loading 
screen employ what Baron called the “experience of reception,” while they remain openly 
constructed. As a result, they illustrate the concept of the archive effect. The instructions and the 
loading screen both feature representations of historical artifacts and references to Medal of 
Honor’s digital and constructed nature, anticipating a gameplay that lets the player manipulate a 
violent, faux historical space that always remains ‘at arm’s length’. 
 
Manon’s Instructions 
Manon Batiste acts as Patterson’s liaison with the French resistance. Her words, along 
with the screen’s aesthetics, offer a historical frame for the anticipated immersive gameplay. 
Opening with “Bonjour,” which somewhat awkwardly marks her as French, she asks the player, 
to “press the (x) button to turn the page and start the briefing” because “[t]ime is of the essence” 

 
101 
 
 
(Figure 44). The card containing her correspondence is placed on various historical artifacts, 
including a map, a compass and an ammunition clip, while her photograph is attached to the 
paper at a slightly crooked angle, rather than employing the straight lines associated with 
computer graphics. When she references the PlayStation controller, prompting the players to 
press a particular button, she directly addresses them in the present, while the historical artifacts 
ground the moment in its narrative environment of 1944, just as her reminder that “time is of the 
essence” similarly relates to past time, rather than play time. This dynamic is repeated when 
Manon ends the briefing by instructing the player in the use of a German weapon in the game: 
“Hint: to gain control of a German machine gun, press the “Action” button. Good luck!” 
As a result, play, exemplified by the controls, becomes grounded in the past time of the 
game diegesis: Manon’s introduction and the presence of historical artifacts tether the player’s 
controller to their corresponding actions in the game’s representation of 1944 and thus frames the 
virtual violence historically. While former FPSs had also provided narrative frameworks for 
play—in the case of Doom, surviving hordes of demons released from hell on a space station—
none employed the extensive use of history to locate the player’s actions in the past in a way that 
strongly connected to an ongoing ideological discourse. Co-creator of Doom John Romero, in 

 
102 
 
 
fact, points to the absence of a strong narrative as a boost of identification with the protagonist’s 
actions: “There was never a name for the DOOM marine because it's supposed to be YOU” (np). 
 
 
Figure 44: Manon 
During this first briefing, Manon asks Patterson (and by extension the player) to recover 
an Allied G-3 officer, who was shot down after returning from a secret meeting with the 
resistance. His knowledge of both Allied battle plans and the resistance puts the entire French 
underground in jeopardy if he is captured. As Wehrmacht search parties are already on the way, 
Patterson is instructed to immediately locate the downed plane “and see where the trail leads. 
(The pilot’s logbook is also missing, so be on the lookout for it as well.)” This is followed by a 
loading screen featuring a fictional “On to Victory!” Army poster (Figure 45). 

 
103 
 
 
 
Figure 45: On to Victory! 
 
Loading Screen Analysis 
 
The loading screen similarly alludes both to play and to the constructed past: the fictional 
poster is marked as an artifact via its wear and tear, with a torn bottom-right corner. The call “On 
to victory!” emulates historical military propaganda, while the game’s logo on the bottom of the 
poster highlights the narrative’s fictional status. The wall to which the poster is attached equally 
combines the materiality of the past setting with the digital present of gameplay. It frames the 
poster with two other, half-visible ones, and the wall-surface is shown to be irregular and rough. 
Underneath, a digital loading bar that is embedded in an indented notch carved into the wall, 
provides feedback about how much loading time has passed.  
The loading screen dovetails the virtuality of gameplay in the player’s present-time with 
the evocation of past material culture. The poster, given the explicit use of the game’s logo, can 
not be confused with a historical artifact. It is merely appropriating the aesthetics and—via wear 

 
104 
 
 
and tear—the ‘oldness’ of the poster that allows it to stand in for a historical object and to evoke 
the archive effect without attempting to claim a ‘truly archival’ status. The combination of 
manufactured materials with the game’s logo thus anticipates the game’s experience as a virtual 
re-enactment of violence in a faux historical space, rather than providing an experience of 
gameplay as a domestic activity grounded in the present. Again, this focus serves to counter 
anxieties connected to the genre’s past games like Doom that had no such strong attention to its 
diegesis and found themselves exposed to accusations of promoting school violence because 
their ungrounded violence was seen as having no narrative or ideological purpose other than to 
add shock value. 
The game’s official strategy book replicates the dual address of player-as-historical 
soldier, which grounds the players actions within MoH’s historical diegesis. Paratexts like 
strategy guides cannot speak directly to the experience of play. However, given its official 
release and backing by DreamWorks Interactive, this strategy book can reflect on the company’s 
intentions. They are not necessarily identical with the actual experiences of play, but they are 
indicative of the ideological aspirations of game company’s publisher Electronic Art, and as such 
worthy of exploration. 
 
Game Strategy Guide 
The Medal of Honor Official Strategy Guide (1999) recursively mimics several text 
genres within its pages, framing a presentation of German NPCs (see chapter III), weapons used 
in the game’s diegesis and basic battle strategies in a fictional OSS Handbook (Figure 46). Its 
mission guide is presented as a ‘most secret’ folder compiled for Patterson (Figure 47). 

 
105 
 
 
 
Figure 46: OSS Handbook 
 
Figure 47: Missions Guide File 
 
The pages that contain the handbook’s cover feature the background of a wooden table, 
on the left side of which Patterson’s Walther P38 handgun is placed (Figure 46). By doing so, it 
establishes the book as an object within the setting of the game. As in gameplay, the readers 
view the objects before them on the table through the eyes of Patterson. The ‘book’s’ language 
reinforces this type of historically framed identification. It opens with “Lieutenant, you will 
encounter numerous enemies…,” establishing the ‘you’ of the text, and thus the reader, as 
Patterson, who is frequently addressed as “Jimmy” thereafter. At the same time, it features 
abstract references to gameplay that are targeted at the player in the present. 

 
106 
 
 
 
Figure 48: Enemy Forces 
 
Figure 49: Weapons Handbook 
 
Figure 48 shows images of two NPC categories within the game: the “Wehrmacht Light 
Infantry” soldier and the “Gestapo Agent.” These images are computer-generated to facilitate 
recognition during game play; however, they are presented as material photographs, pasted into 
the book via adhesive mounting corners. Both NPC categories are described to the player via 
their “hit points,”— the amount of damage required to defeat them, “accuracy”—their ability to 
directly hit the player-character, “aggression”—the degree to which the enemy will pursue or fire 
at Patterson, “evasiveness”—their ability to evade attacks, and “appearances”—the missions that 
feature them. While some of these categories could be framed to directly address Patterson, the 

 
107 
 
 
categories of “hit points” and “appearances” represent such a level of abstraction and an 
awareness of future missions that they must be aimed at the player.  
Later in the book, however, a note explicitly combines the abstract category of hit points 
with the address of Patterson: “Humans (whether yourself or the Germans, Jimmy) take 
approximately 24 points of damage for every second they are in the explosion…” (32) Besides 
using the category of hit points, the class of “humans” represents an equally abstract group. 
While “humans” in the physical world feature an enormous range of different strength and 
tenacity, the text frames them as a category of NPCs, while still addressing Patterson as the 
note’s reader. As a result, it speaks to the player’s actions and strategic decision as being those of 
Patterson, and thus locates gameplay in Medal of Honor’s past diegesis. 
The Weapons Handbook, while not nearly as thorough as the weapon descriptions in Call 
of Duty’s strategy guide (chapter IV), describes both the weapons’ in-game use, and their 
historical relevance to WWII, again locating tools of the player in the historical world of the 
game. Figure 49 shows a Walther P38 and a MP40 submachine gun, while a chart indicates both 
their magazine capacities, and the point-value of the damage they deal to Patterson’s enemies. 
Like the description of the enemies, these abstract values possess relevance only in the context of 
gameplay. Below the chart, a small blurb indicates that “[t]his short recoil weapon was popular 
with infantry in the German army” (24), providing some level of historical context. Underneath 
the blurb, a paperclipped “special intelligence” note again provides numerical values that instruct 
the player, with the paperclip functioning as a hinge between the flatness of the printed guide 

 
108 
 
 
book and the three-dimensional handbook on Patterson’s desk: “Each hit on a helmeted enemy’s 
head has a 50 percent chance of killing the target…” (24). 
The weapon handbook’s fetishistic depiction of historical weapons not only provides the 
player with gameplay instructions, but also plugs into contemporary gun culture and its 
celebration of historical weaponry. It features twelve weapons ranging from the Springfield ‘01 
Sniper Rifle—“100 percent American made” (26)—and the Thompson Sub Machine Gun—
“popular with American Commando forces in both World War II and the Korean War” (27)—to 
the M1 Garand rifl —“famous for becoming the first standard self-loading rifle in American 
military history” (29). As a result of these descriptions, the faux handbook reads in large part as 
much as a game guide as it does as a gun collector’s catalogue. Its proud introduction of the “100 
percent American made” rifle echoes a popular discourse within U.S. consumer culture that is to 
a large extent centered around cars and, more importantly, firearms. 
The “popular” and “famous” WWII guns within the game replicate the history buff’s 
desire to shoot the quality technology that once fueled the Greatest Generation’s offensives, 
reenacting their attacks from a historical distance. The book thus advertises the game’s virtual 
guns as tools to re-live a proud moment in American history—an American success by U.S. 
troops and U.S.-manufactured weaponry of the past. However, the image of the Walther P38 
handgun (Figure 49) also recalls its earlier use as a prop positioned next to the OSS Strategy 
Book’s cover (Figure 46). By doing so, it underlines Patterson’s gun ownership and reinforces 
the notion that he is the ‘true’ reader of the book, further conflating the player and the player-
character. 
This dual address in the guide’s fictional texts cannot be merely dismissed as part of the 
strategy guide-genre. Other games’ guides, including those published by BradyGames, only 

 
109 
 
 
rarely attempt to replicate the players’ subject positions. For example, the company’s strategy 
guide for Mario 64 (1996) clearly differentiates between acts of play and the player-character’s 
actions—“When sliding down a hill, you can jump to regain control of Mario” (4, my emphasis). 
Neither is this a question of game genre—even in later FPSs’ guides, the conflation of subject 
positions remains minimal. While the strategy guide for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007) 
does refer to an NPC as “your CO [Commanding Officer],” it never masquerades as a document 
from within the game’s diegesis. It also never addresses readers by the characters’ names,58 and 
instead primarily refers to the player’s rather than to the player-character’s strategic choices: 
“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is not the type of game you can just charge through” (13). 
The subject position of the Medal of Honor strategy guide thus uniquely provides an 
explicit reinforcement of the game’s implicit subject position to its readers and as a result allows 
its ideology to come to the surface. While its collection of fictional texts cannot possibly reflect 
the multiplicity of play experiences shaped by the players, their individual environment, and 
cultural context, it reveals the publisher’s intended subject positions. Its recursive “book-within-
the-book” style and use of historical artifacts that address its readers as Patterson establish a 
framework for historical reenactment that incorporates abstract references to gameplay and 
contemporary gun culture into the violent past space of the game. Effectively, they dislocate 
these present moments from the domestic sphere by reinforcing the place that major elements of 
gameplay, such as weapons, occupy in the game’s diegesis. As a result, like the artifacts 
described by Allison (see above), these moments become “placed securely in the past…” (169). 
The guide thus constitutes an artifact that draws attention to the game’s distinction from former 
                                                
58 There are several player-characters over the course of the game 

 
110 
 
 
FPSs, as it highlights the strategy of separating Medal of Honor’s violent gameplay from the 
present and locating it in the past. 
 
Gameplay Analysis 
Following the loading screen discussed above, gameplay commences. The screen now 
consists of a three-dimensional representation of game space in which the player operates as 
Patterson, while the HUD communicates gameplay details to the player (Figure 50). This HUD, 
as I will show later, illustrates the games design as based on the Nintendo 64 game 
GoldenEye007. 
 
Figure 50: Mission 1 
On the top right, the image of a bullet indicates the current weapon used. To its left, a 
number shows the amount of ammunition available before needing to reload, while to its right, a 
number indicates the overall available ammunition for this weapon. On the top left, a compass 
signals the direction of the player-character. It is surrounded by a circle ranging in color from 

 
111 
 
 
green to red. As the player receives damage, this circle begins to recede—once it completely 
disappears, the player-character has died and failed the mission, although his death is eliminated 
from the overall narrative (see below). Whenever the player-character is hit by hostile fire, a red 
triangle on the compass indicates the direction of the attack. The HUD thus combines the 
materiality of artifacts (bullet, compass) that correspond the Patterson’s historical space with 
abstract non-diegetic, often numerical, indicators that provide feedback to the player. In the case 
of the compass, both types elements are combined via the colored circle and the red triangles. 
Using the HUD, the player engages with the virtual space by fulfilling the game’s 
specific objectives: recovering intelligence from a pilot, who turns out to have fallen to his death, 
and finding his plane. Sneaking through a maze of hedges and town streets, Patterson makes his 
way toward the plane, ideally killing all German soldiers on the way. Unlike trench warfare, the 
player rarely encounters a group of more than three soldiers. This speaks to both the 
technological limitations of the 1994 PlayStation, and the thematic and ludic significance of 
Patterson as soldier-spy, as opposed to Doom’s or Wolfenstein 3D’s run-and-gun type of 
gameplay. Once the pilot’s logbook is recovered from the plane, which is guarded by two 
soldiers, the player is prompted to check his updated mission objectives. These ask him to move 
into the nearby town, eliminate at least eight Gestapo officers, sabotage their radio transmitter 
and find the hideout of the French resistance. Once Patterson enters the hideout, the mission 
concludes and, depending on the successful achievement of all objectives, moves on to mission 
two. Alternatively—for example, if Patterson did not recover the pilot’s logbook or find the 
plane before entering the town or did not destroy the radio transmitter—the player is forced to 
restart the beginning of the first mission in order to carry out all required objectives. 
 

 
112 
 
 
Engagement with Space 
Gameplay links this narrative closely to an engagement with its faux historical space. The 
player progresses through the French village by moving the controller’s two joysticks with their 
left and right thumb. The left joystick corresponds to the virtual camera’s (i.e. Patterson’s) 
horizontal movements. Pushing the stick to the front and back leads the player-character forward 
and backward, while pushing it to the left and right causes him to “strafe,” i.e. walk sideways in 
a straight line.59 The right joystick tilts and pans the virtual camera by pressing up or down 
(tilting up and down) and sideways (panning to left and right), while the use of the buttons 
causes Patterson to attack, run, or move in a prone position. It does not allow for unusual means 
of movement (walking on hands, skipping, etc.).  
This limitation, which is arguably a result of the PlayStation’s processing power at the 
time and the number of the controller’s buttons and joysticks, does not present itself as a true 
constriction. Unusual means of movement would be of no use in the represented conflict and 
skipping through the battlefield would be perceived as historically inaccurate, and thus hamper 
immersion. Chapman ascribes a similar relationship between the perception of historical 
accuracy and immersion when he talks about objects within the game, although he rejects the 
term immersion, due to the hyperbolic promises attached to the name and its frequent conflation 
with the concept of ‘flow’ (68; 84). He claims that within the realist simulation style, which 
includes games like Medal of Honor, the “rule-governed behaviors ascribed to 
objects/environments and characters … will often try to show the past as it is claimed to have 
appeared to agents” (61). I argue that the abilities of the player-character (i.e. the game’s 
subject), including their limitations, function similarly in the realist simulation style. Patterson’s 
                                                
59 Medal of Honor permits the player to choose between two differently mapped controller layouts that offer 
variations on which buttons trigger which actions. In my analysis, I focus on the pre-set layout 1. 

 
113 
 
 
movements, as executed by the player, are subject to limitations inherent in the game’s rules 
which reflect constraints present in the past event simulated by Medal of Honor. This contributes 
to the game’s sense of realism. 
The player’s movements are funneled through the virtual space by means of obstacles 
that allow for few variations. While in the ‘real’ world, bushes, houses and fences would allow 
someone access if they forced themselves through by breaking doors or jumping over low 
fences. But, the game limits movements to a maze-like obstacle course (Figure 51) that features a 
meandering route with a large number of dead ends. The feeling of presence in this space is thus 
not limited by Patterson’s physical abilities—there is no narrative motivation, like injuries, to his 
inability to perform these actions—but the game’s abstract rules determine the player’s 
interaction with space. 
 
Figure 51: Mission 1 Map (taken from the Strategy Guide) 
 
While the game rules’ arbitrary nature could be argued to hamper immersion, more 
importantly, these limitations ultimately function to tie gameplay into the invariable overall 
narrative of successes embedded in the historical environment of WWII. Chapman has provided 

 
114 
 
 
the first theorization of space in historical video games, in which he argues that these games 
require the player to negotiate “real space in response to, and to gain particular responses from, 
screen-based spatial representations” (100). Agreeing with his conclusions, I find that the space 
of Medal of Honor, which structures the player-character’s hostile encounters within a maze, 
constitutes a narrative resource in its own right. It not only anticipates the player’s actions by 
guiding their movement through the game space but also provides narrative cues in both its 
maze-like design and its visual inventory of WWII film tropes.  
In fact, the narrative structure of the maze-type game reinforces the construction of 
Patterson’s intelligence and courage. In Hamlet on the Holodeck (1997), Janet Murray explains 
the lasting appeal of the maze structure, as it melds “a cognitive problem (finding the path) with 
an emotionally symbolic pattern (finding what is frightening and unknown) …” (130) Like my 
earlier description of Patterson, she finds that the maze story appeals to the player-character’s 
“combination of intelligence and courage” (130). Calling upon Patterson’s (and the player’s) 
courage and intelligence, the construction of Medal of Honor’s spatial diegesis as a maze thus 
directly reflects the conception of Patterson as courageous—as his heroic efforts of taking out six 
Wehrmacht soldiers alone illustrated at the beginning of the game—and intelligent. In his 
opening address, Hargrove praises Patterson’s success during his schoolwork: “Excellent 
leadership skills, noted for being especially smart and resourceful…” with “straight As, from 
start to finish.” The construction of space in the OSS’s missions thus confirm the player-
character’s ideal abilities and offers the player an attractive object of identification as a result. 
The game space itself recalls the material inventory of WWII combat films, even if in a 
far less developed fashion than during its less interactive moments like mission briefings. Set in 
the ruins of a war-torn French village (Figure 52), the first mission uses visual tropes familiar 

 
115 
 
 
from WWII movies like Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan. The image includes both a demolished 
vehicle marked as part of Nazi Germany technology via the Wehrmacht’s Balkenkreuz (“bar 
cross”) emblem and a corridor of ruined brick stone buildings. Figure 53, one of many possible 
examples across the film and the genre in general, illustrates the presence of the same visual 
language in Saving Private Ryan that features a similar corridor of ruins.  
Chapman calls the spatial structures that link space and narrative by embedded 
information “narrative gardens,” and compares the unfolding of their narratives to those of 
theme-park rides and sequentially staged formal gardens (102). His description of game space as 
a deliberate structure that incorporates both the smaller gameplay level and the larger, invariable 
historical narrative resonates with my reading of MoH as an immersive experience that remains 
contained within a historically and ideologically invariable framework—an experience, that 
allows for some agency on the game play level, while the overall narrative—to use Chapman’s 
metaphor of the theme park ride—remains ‘on rails.’ 
One should, however, not simply dismiss this limited agency, as the navigation of space 
provides the player with a meaningful catalyst for immersion. In The Medium of the Video Game 
(2001), Mark Wolf looks into the player’s agency in maze-type games, explaining that “off-
screen space can often be actively investigated and explored by the player [, which] . . . can 
constitute a large part of game play itself” (52). The spatial consistency of these spaces allows 
players to view it “from multiple angles and varied viewpoints…” (66) Not only is this agency 
meaningful for immersion, but its limitation allows the greater ideology of American success to 
pervade gameplay design and distinguish it from former FPSs.

Embedding gameplay within a rigid, ideologically inconspicuous historical frame and 
grounding Patterson as a historical subject with great identificatory appeal was all the more 
necessary at the time of Medal of Honor’s release because of the post-Columbine discourse. The 
constant presence of the gun in this FPS consistently marks the game space as one of violent 

 
117 
 
 
conflict. Allison confirms this when she writes that “[t]he visual and spatial experience of the 
game is intrinsically linked to the violence perpetrated through the weapons, which are usually a 
permanent fixture at the bottom of the screen” (179). However, this is not merely a matter of 
aesthetics. As “video game space is ‘actionable’ predominantly through shooting” (179) in FPSs, 
both its visuals and its engagement through play unsurprisingly find counterparts in former 
iterations of the genre like Doom and thus need to be contained in a historical narrative 
framework that extends to the game’s construction of the player subject position in order to not 
attract concern. 
 
POV 
As I have laid out in this dissertation’s introduction, the relationship between the POV 
shot and immersion is a complicated one. Scholars like Laurie Taylor (2003) have claimed that, 
rather than functioning as a catalyst for immersion, the inability of the FPS to portray the player-
character during gameplay leads to issues with projection and suspension of disbelief. She argues 
that “[a]n exclusively first-person point-of-view impoverishes spatial presentation in the game 
and removes the possibility of the player playing within the game space, which removes the 
possibility for the player to internally experience the game space” (29). In an exploration of 
online games, Taylor similarly claims that avatars, i.e. the visible embodiments of the player-
character, “are crucial in producing a sense of presence, of ‘worldness’” (117). Other scholars, 
often coming from a different disciplinary background, have disagreed with this view. 
Geographers Ian Shaw and Barney Warf (2009) claim that the “removal of an on-screen object 
facilitates the player’s unmediated encounter with virtual space” (1336). Yet, as my discussion of 
MoH illustrates, Taylor is correct in claiming that, indeed, immersion in WWII FPSs is tied more 
strongly to the idea of realistically offering a quasi-touristic access to past events, in which the 

 
118 
 
 
player can move relatively freely within rules that mark the game as physically and historically 
accurate.  
It is thus spatial agency rather than just visual identification that impacts the experience 
of gameplay. In Digital Games as History (2016), social scientist and game scholar Adam 
Chapman finds the realism of historical FPSs to be grounded in the impossible attempt to show 
the past ‘as it really was’ via rule-governed behaviors that align the past with the everyday logic 
of the present. They exhibit a high level of visual specificity that draws from codes and tropes of 
Western cinematic realism and offer the player a type of spatial agency and control over the 
virtual gaze (61-66). Both spatial agency and its limitation by the game’s specific rules 
contribute to the MoH’s immersion and its restrictions that ideologically ground the game. As a 
result, it creates the feeling of being transported to the scenario’s time and space via the actions 
of the player. This restricts the game’s violent play to a specific setting that differs from the 
present world, and, ironically, to the context of virtual representation, rendering its violence less 
suspect. Unlike FPSs with fictional violent scenarios, like Doom, the setting of Medal of Honor 
is clearly defined and distinguished from the present by its historical framing. 
Additionally, the FPS Medal of Honor does not offer a representation of the player 
character on screen in the manner of Saving Private Ryan, whose main characters can be seen by 
the audience. As point-of-view long takes, to use a correspondent concept from film analysis, no 
level’s gameplay includes images of Patterson, who is only seen during cinematic cutscenes and 
on documents between the levels, leaving the players with a view of only their enemies; the 
decision not to constantly shoot a gun is driven by the risk of being exposed, or unnecessarily 

 
119 
 
 
depleting the available bullet rounds, rather than by the concern of friendly fire.60 As a result, the 
virtual camera becomes equivalent with the weapons’ crosshairs: what is seen is to be killed. Due 
to the genre’s ubiquity throughout the United States in the late 1990s, it is safe to conclude that 
in spite of the inability to play within the game space, as pointed out by Taylor, these games 
possess the ability to excite their players. As I will show, the apparatus of the game itself takes 
over the identificatory position of the visible player-character, removing the need for an on-
screen human object for identification. 
In his book The Imaginary Signifier (1982), Christian Metz shows that identification with 
on-screen characters or their actors during a film is secondary to the primary identification with 
the cinematic apparatus itself, an identification that does not require a human on-screen presence. 
His reason for this belief is that even the presence of a human object on screen, “still tell[s] us 
nothing about the place of the spectator’s ego in the inauguration of the signifier” (47). Rather, 
as the spectators identify with themselves as ‘looking’, they similarly associate with the camera, 
or its placeholder during the film’s screening, the projector. As a result, they are not startled 
when pans or tracking shots simulate their bodies’ movements, while they remain still: the 
viewer has “no need to turn [his body] really, he has turned in his all-seeing capacity, his 
identification with the movement of the camera being that of a transcendental, not an empirical 
subject” (50). The critical failure of Robert Montgomery’s Lady in the Lake (1947), and the 
intellectual labor required to engage with art films like Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void (2009), both 
of which were shot entirely from their protagonists’ points of view, point to the fact that the 
absence of a secondary identification with an on-screen protagonist constitutes, in fact, a hurdle 
                                                
60 The missions that include the extraction of friendly soldiers from enemy territory do feature non-hostile characters 
on the screen, however, these are rare instances. 

 
120 
 
 
for a film’s immersive powers. Even when this hurdle is facilitated by an idiosyncratic cinematic 
style that leaves a viewer largely unprepared for a film, self-identification ‘as look’ does not 
appear to come naturally to viewers.  
This, however, is different in the genre of the FPS video game. Unlike in film, the camera 
is not a transcendental subject in games, but operates within a set of predetermined conditions, 
controlled by the players themselves. As a result, the relationship between players and their 
virtual bodies transcends mere self-identification-as-vision in the sense of Metz: the players’ 
agency within the game’s strict parameters allows them to identify with the apparatus trifold: as 
vision, as movement, and as aggression. On top of Patterson, Medal of Honor’s players are 
invited to identify with the revealing, kinetic and destructive capabilities of the game’s virtual 
camera—Patterson’s eyes—and his gun. To modify Metz’ quote, the apparatus is more than the 
audience’s “all-seeing capacity” to the players. To them, the all-seeing capacity, the moving 
capacity, and the destructive capacity within the game’s diegesis all form the game’s apparatus 
that serves as the player’s point of identification. It is this conflation of vision and violence that 
constitutes the primary mode of engaging with the FPS’s game space. Thus, in order for Medal 
of Honor to distinguish itself from pre-Columbine-era games, it required a robust historical 
narrative in order to motivate its focus on aggression.  
 
Death 
The absence of the player-character’s death from MoH’s narrative empowers players with 
fantasies of immortality but limits them by not allowing any alternative outcomes, including 
Patterson’s death. In its treatment of death, Medal of Honor is situated between classic arcade-
style games that provide the player character with a number of lives and entirely reset the 

 
121 
 
 
program once they are depleted,61 and “save anywhere” games that eliminate the concept of lives 
and allow the players to create a save point62 wherever they desire.63  Patterson’s inability to die 
reinforces the game’s overall ideology of American success during WWII. Rather than focusing 
on the very real prospect of death U.S. troops faced in Europe, eliminating his mission failures 
from the storyline results in the narrative of an exceptionally apt soldier, which in turn 
contributes to the player-character’s desirability as a source of identification. 
When the player character in Medal of Honor is fatally wounded, the virtual camera, now 
deprived of its function as a gun and unavailable to the player’s controls, tilts up to suggest that 
Patterson has fallen on his back, the screen fades to black, and without suggesting physical harm 
by showing blood, the mission restarts from its beginning, not acknowledging this moment. It 
thus differs from games that tie death into their narratives like Call of Duty 4 (2007), The Last of 
Us (2013) and—a new development in a historical war FPS—Battlefield 1 (2016), forcing the 
player to abandon the fantasy of an indestructible stand-in and introducing a new player-
character after the first one’s passing, Patterson’s death erases the failed mission from the overall 
progress. Every mission, and eventually the game itself, is finished by means of a player-
character that has never died or failed a task. Appropriately, the virtually embodied gun can only 
kill, but not be killed. It is not possible to circumvent this purge of failure from the overall 
                                                
61 Examples include Namco’s Pac-Man (1980), Konami’s Frogger (1981) and Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. 
(1985). 
62 A save point is created when the player saves the game’s progress at a particular time and place within the 
diegesis, prompting the game to restart there, rather than at the beginning of the level or a pre-determined 
checkpoint when the player-character has died or failed the mission otherwise. 
63 Historically more associated with PC gaming than console gaming, examples of this include Rockstar Games’ 
Max Payne 2 (2003) and Valve Corporation’s Half-Life 2 (2004). 

 
122 
 
 
narrative and have Patterson die. As a result, the character invincibility not only empowers 
players, but restricts them as well.  
Constructing an alternative (hi-)story by allowing Patterson to be killed by Axis soldiers 
lies outside of the spectrum of possibilities, as the game’s outcome has been predetermined. The 
player is forced to perform an individual story that, in its trajectory toward success, condenses 
the broad overall narrative ark of the Allied forces’ victorious struggle in WWII into the 
narrative of a single victorious soldier. Thus, the absence of failure and death both empower and 
limit the players, forcing them to perform the story of the troops’ greatness on an individual 
level. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, Medal of Honor is no memorial to the sacrifice of fallen 
heroes, but a synecdochical portrayal of the U.S. military in toto as the invincible super-soldier 
Patterson. 
 
GoldenEye007 (1997) 
The far less controversial 1997 Nintendo James Bond FPS GoldenEye007, on which 
Medal of Honor was based—even though it was not set in WWII—shows that the drastic 
reduction (or even elimination) of blood and gore could help FPS’s acceptance as a genre. 
GoldenEye007 was located in the James Bond universe, the films of which had never exceeded a 
PG-13 rating and were widely accepted as harmless entertainment. Equally important, the game 
was exclusively released on Nintendo’s N64 console that had the reputation of featuring family-
friendly games. Given the popularity of GoldenEye007, console players of 1999 would have 
likely been familiar with it and would have recognized the similarities in MoH that go far beyond 
the player-characters’ first names. The Nintendo game constitutes the first moment in which a 
console, rather than a PC, featured the ability to play an FPS, which explains the overlap in 

 
123 
 
 
design. As a result, players are invited to react to Medal of Honor’s similarities by constructing 
Patterson within the framework of Bond’s personal traits. 
At the time, Nintendo had successfully established itself as a major distributor of family-
friendly video games by contrasting their products with SEGA’s more adult-oriented releases in 
the December 9, 1993 senate hearings focused on video game violence. In particular, the senate 
hearings discussed games Night Trap (1992) and Sega’s violent version of Mortal Kombat 
(1992)—which sold significantly better than Nintendo’s heavily censored release of the same 
title. Initiated by democrat Joe Lieberman, the hearing claimed that Nintendo was a game 
company that constituted no major cause for concern. Games like Sega’s Mortal Kombat and 
their graphic violence, on the other hand, ultimately led to concerns that resulted in the founding 
of the Entertainment Software Rating Board. In “Super Mario Nation” (1997), Steven L. Kent 
sums up the negotiations by stating that while the committee “gave grudging praise to Nintendo 
for editing Mortal Kombat, they condemned the entire industry for recklessly allowing children 
access to acts of extreme violence” (47). 
Medal of Honor was released on the Sony PlayStation, a platform that had published a 
large roster of mature-rated violent games since its 1995 U.S. release,64 and found itself in a 
similar position to Sega and other game publishers that released adult content: the senate 
hearings raised public awareness and anxiety about games that featured virtual violence. It 
remained a challenge to counter the public perception of the FPS as a subversively violent genre 
within its own, not explicitly all-age appropriate, publication context. MoH with its connections 
to Saving Private Ryan and its evocation of historical material culture was instrumental in 
                                                
64 Some examples are Mortal Kombat 3 (Midway Games, 1995), Doom (Williams Entertainment, 1995), Loaded 
(Interplay Entertainment Corp., 1995), Alien Trilogy (Acclaim Entertainment, 1996), Die-Hard Trilogy (Fox 
Interactive, 1996), and Resident Evil (Capcom, 1996).  

 
124 
 
 
shifting the perception of the FPS genre away from Nintendo’s quasi-monopoly on family-
friendly releases. 
GoldenEye007 itself largely translated the plot of GoldenEye (1995) film into an 
interactive medium. Like Medal of Honor’s overall representation of successful U.S. history, its 
overall adapted storyline remains unchanged (see my discussion of Chapman above): In his first 
post-cold war appearance, Bond investigates two electromagnetic “GoldenEye” weapon 
satellites, whose control has fallen into the hands of a Russian crime syndicate. This syndicate is 
headed by Bond’s former MI6 comrade Alec Trevelyan, who plans to use the satellites against 
the UK. Locating the satellite dish in Cuba, Bond is captured, while ‘bondgirl’ Natalya 
Simonova manages to destroy the satellite by programming it to enter the earth’s atmosphere and 
rescue Bond. 
Given the game’s basis in GoldenEye007, the elevation of the player-character to an 
idealized supersoldier in MoH is reinforced by transtextual pointers to the genre of the spy 
thriller, and to the James Bond franchise more specifically. Communication professor Kimberly 
Neuendorf et al. (2009) echo a wide consensus among scholars65, critics, and fans when they 
point out that “the uber-masculine persona of James Bond has been a predictable element for the 
Bond franchise’s worldwide audience” (747). As a result of these expectations, linking Patterson 
to Bond by emulating GoldenEye007’s transfers some of his traits to Medal of Honor’s 
protagonist.  
The player’s ability to become Bond in the highly acclaimed and financially successful (8 
million copies sold66) FPS GoldenEye007 for the Nintendo 64 console infuses play with the 
                                                
65 Cf. Amis (1965, ch. 4), Bennett and Woollacott (1987, ch.7), Black (2001, ch.6), etc. 
66 Bateman and Boon (2006, 233) 

 
125 
 
 
cultural, social and sexual prowess Bond exhibits throughout the franchise, not the least in 
Martin Campbell’s GoldenEye (1995). While GoldenEye007’s gameplay itself offers the same 
subject position of player-as-gun as Medal of Honor, external framings of Bond immerse the 
player with empowering fantasies of “uber-masculinity,” the extent of which would not directly 
result from the game in isolation. In GoldenEye, James Bond’s masculinity occurs because of his 
cultivation and cunning, rather than physical power, which renders him as an ideal agent for 
secret missions. The film establishes his upper-class cultivation through status symbols like 
luxurious watches and cars (and women, one could argue). His strong sexual appetite and lack of 
care for the expensive gadgets he uses (much to the chagrin of their inventor, ‘Q’) are presented 
as a superior virtue in contrast to romantic feelings or responsible behavior. Throughout the film 
(and series), women are highly objectified, and Q’s reactions are that of an absentminded 
inventor, which elevates Bond’s disengaged coolness. His intimate knowledge of covert tactics, 
technology and politics finds its counterpart in Patterson’s strong educational background and his 
sneak-attack on Wehrmacht soldiers prior to the game’s beginning. 
Design for Medal of Honor began in November 1997, three months after the release of 
GoldenEye007. This Nintendo 64 game is widely acknowledged as having a general influence on 
later console FPSs, especially in its development of local multiplayer capacities and its control 
scheme that in variations would become the standard way of console FPSs’ controls. However, 
the parallels between the missions of James Bond and Medal of Honor’s Patterson are more 
striking than in any later FPSs outside of the Bond franchise.  
Early reviews of Medal of Honor tirelessly point out the similarities between the two 
games. Cultural studies scholar Martin Barker (2004) has drawn attention to the ways ancillary 
materials like reviews shape expectations, and as a result influence the experience of a film, 

 
126 
 
 
illustrating that a discussion of these reviews will grand some access into the general perception 
of Medal of Honor. Game Informer (12/99) claims that “if you see someone playing [Medal of 
Honor], you may think that it’s a sequel [to Goldeneye007] or a new James Bond game. The 
resemblance between the two products is uncanny” (49), GameWeek Magazine (November/99) 
asks its readers to “[l]et PlayStation owners know that this is their GoldenEye” (14), and Official 
U.S. Playstation Magazine’s Kraig Kujawa (12/99) calls it “World War II’s version of 007” 
(132).  
Both the reference to the James Bond universe that eerily resembles Medal of Honor in 
its combination of stealth and armed conflict, and the idea of a ‘007 World War II’ illustrates 
how these games were regarded. MoH was seen as merely changing the setting of the narrative 
of the earlier game. MoH is indeed ‘their,’ i.e. PlayStation players’, GoldenEye007 in that both 
games tie their decidedly ungory violence to an established framework—the James Bond 
universe and representations of WWII, respectively—and, in public reception, form a different 
type of FPS game than Doom with its gory conflicts that possess no well-established precedent in 
popular culture. 
 
Figure 54: GoldenEye007 

 
127 
 
 
Figure 54 demonstrates the aesthetic and ludic similarities between Medal of Honor and 
GoldenEye007. While both feature typical elements of the FPS—the maze-like organization of 
the virtual space and the centered gun and the bottom of the screen—the HUD with its image of 
a bullet corresponding to the currently used weapon and the numeric indication of rounds 
remaining overall and in the current clip is an innovation on the part of GoldenEye007’s 
designers that was directly adopted in DreamWorks’ 1999 release. However, MoH moved these 
elements to the top left of the screen from the bottom right. The game’s control design by 
Nintendo allowed an FPS for the first time to be played on a console, rather than through the PC-
typical peripherals of keyboard and mouse.  
Both games’ designs were limited by the technical capacities of their respective consoles 
(the Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation), as they did not have the calculating power, online-play67, 
and complex controller periphery of a contemporary personal computer at their disposal. Media 
journalist Ben Gill writes in the Encyclopedia of Video Games that “GoldenEye 007 (1997) . . . 
made first person shooting games a viable proposition on consoles when previously the genre 
had been associated primarily with home computers because the mouse-and-keyboard controls 
allowed for greater aiming precision and their on-line capabilities provided a multiplayer 
experience that wouldn’t exist on consoles for several years” (139). Thus, it comes as no surprise 
that Medal of Honor looked to Nintendo’s first successful console FPS for inspiration, as it had 
overcome these limitations to produce a highly successful game.  
Medal of Honor portrays missions of espionage and sabotage that find their counterpart in 
cultural memory of the covert aggressions of the Cold War era and its aftermath, as fictionalized 
                                                
67 Sega’s Dreamcast, the first home console with online play capabilities, would not be released in North America 
until 1999. 

 
128 
 
 
by the Bond franchise68, rather than in WWII’s “real” battles. This is evident in Patterson’s 
relationship with the opposite sex, and Manon Batiste in particular. 
Patterson’s French liaison Manon Batiste, who starts out with addressing the player-
character with a polite “Bonjour. . .Welcome to the fight!” begins to show a personal investment 
in Patterson in later mission briefs, asking him to “[b]e careful,” refers to him as “mon pote” 
(“my buddy”) and “mon ami” (“my friend”), and becomes mindful of her word choices when 
referring to a former love interest, calling him “[a]n old boyfriend, er, male acquaintance of 
mine” (strikethrough in original). In light of a new German weapon she asks him to “[t]read 
lightly, mon ami” and admits to “hav[ing] grown fond of [him] over this past year.” 
EA Games’ Medal of Honor: Heroes (2006) for the PlayStation Portable hand-held 
console substantiates this increasingly personable relationship as a trajectory toward romance, as 
James Patterson is revealed to have proposed to Manon after the war. While players in 1999 
could obviously not be familiar with this later narrative development, it confirms that Manon’s 
language choices can be read as more than friendly banter, and that constructing their 
relationship’s dynamics as similar to those of James Bond and his female allies (appropriately 
referred to as “Bond girls,” whose name often allude to their sexualized narrative position69) at 
any particular cinematic installment is, in fact, a valid, “canonical” reading of the franchise’s 
first game. While Patterson’s relationship with Manon is framed more romantically than Bond’s 
hypersexual relationships, their ability to attract the opposite sex connects the two characters.  
                                                
68 Particularly striking examples include the films You Only Live Twice (1967), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), For 
Your Eyes Only (1981), A View to a Kill (1985) and GoldenEye (1995). 
69 Examples include Honey Rider in Dr. No (1962), Mary Goodnight in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), and 
Dr. Holly Goodhead in Moonraker (1979). 

 
129 
 
 
 
The dynamics of the Bond franchise that influence MoH’s retelling of WWII function 
differently from those that form memory along the lines of culture, nation 70, or language. Medal 
of Honor adapts elements from the financially successful game GoldenEye007 out of the 
economic concern to create a successful commodity. Those processes should therefore be framed 
within the context of capitalism and its media systems, and how adapting the brand of James 
Bond relates to systems of historical representation which Medal of Honor engages in, in 
general.  
Alison Landsberg (2015) claims that with the emergence of mass media and the resulting 
commodification of historical narratives, memories and images of the past became available as 
“prosthetic memory” to people who had otherwise no biological claims to them (18). Reacting 
against Adorno’s “culture industry” model and its attack of a commercially structured modernity, 
Landsberg attempts to redeem capitalism and the technologies of its mass culture by pointing out 
that they “open up a world of images outside a person’s lived experience, creating a portable, 
fluid, and nonessentialist form of memory” (18). Her optimism that commodified prosthetic 
memory makes images and narratives “widely available to people who live in different places 
and come from different backgrounds, races, and classes” (21) neglects to consider the new 
frameworks of power relationships and privileges that necessarily go along with such a shift 
toward circulation practices according to free-market principles. However, her notion that 
productive analyses of memories as commodities require different categories than political ones 
like ’nation’, is a powerful one. Downplayed problems with capitalism are at the center of media 
scholars Jonathan Bullinger’s and Andrew J. Salvati’s Marxist anxieties in their attack on “Brand 
WW2.” While they also chide narrative templates that inform our collective memory of the war 
                                                
70 cf. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities, 1991. 

 
130 
 
 
for their reductive tendencies, their major concern lies in the fact that those possessing the 
necessary influence are in a position of shaping collective and cultural memory. Within the 
capitalist system, memories become “brands” with recognizable visual signifiers and emotional 
cues: 
Brands today are nearly ubiquitous elements of our culture, whose inherent reputational 
economic logic allows them to colonize societal institutions previously assumed to be 
immune or unrelated to branding. Brands possess a dynamism that allows for cooptation 
of consumers’ immaterial labor that can both challenge and reinforce the core brand 
message. This results in a cultural memory reduced, packaged, and sold back to the 
audience as a branded representation left to stand in for historical complexity. (1) 
 
I do not wish to join Bullinger and Salvati in mourning the inferior quality of narrative templates, 
as I am not invested here in determining whether they constitute an endorsement for or a defect 
of capitalism. However, observing the effects of the templates that were commodified by the film 
and video game industry can show us the epistemic space they carve out for their audience, and 
the kind of contact with history promised by the medium. Brands like Medal of Honor shape 
cultural narratives of history, and attention to their status as products of capitalism can show us 
how commodities shape such narratives differently than concepts like nation or language. 
The player embodies the invincible Patterson, displaced from the Cold War to WWII, and 
the difference between player and Bond drives home the point that “[m]ost gamers couldn’t hack 
the real thing” (Computer Gaming World 10/03, 104), elevating the Greatest Generation in the 
game in much the same way as the post-1995 discourse in which the game participates. What is 
more, MoH illustrates Bullinger’s and Salvati’s concern that within the capitalist system, the 
power of shaping collective memory lies within those that already possess the necessary 
influence. DreamWorks’ literal capital that is needed to produce and distribute an AAA game 
like Medal of Honor is the most obvious example of this, but Spielberg’s cultural capital, 
acquired by directing films like Schindler’s List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan also allows his 

 
131 
 
 
name to give this WWII Bond adaptation the guise of historical verisimilitude. As I have shown 
above, in spite of the widely recognized similarities to GoldenEye 007, and the vast differences 
to Saving Private Ryan, the attachment of Spielberg’s name to Medal of Honor caused 
frustration in reviewers, as the game’s lack of blood did not replicate the SPR’s markers of realist 
style, which they mistook for historical verisimilitude. As Spielberg stood for historical 
accuracy, any departure from a total historical experience, within the limits of the PlayStation’s 
technological abilities, seems to run counter to the associations with his history film work. 
 Medal of Honor adapts the brand of James Bond, along with the construction of its 
protagonist, based on economic considerations. The highly successful (see above) console game 
GoldenEye007 becomes a template for designing a game that promises to be equally profitable. 
In doing so, Medal of Honor’s retelling of WWII history becomes infused with the fictionalized 
cold-war inventory of conflict that had characterized the majority of the Bond film franchise up 
to its release. As a result, James Patterson takes on Bond’s “uber-masculine persona,” both 
immersing the player by offering transtextual fantasies of power and limiting this immersion by 
idealizing the invisible uber-soldier.  
 
Conclusion 
“If ever the romantic notions of being a spy actually existed,” Medal of Honor’s booklet 
claims, “it was probably with the OSS” (5). As I have shown, the game’s narrative frame and 
gameplay, built around ideological notions of the post-1994 “Greatest Generation” discourse and 
the James Bond game GoldenEye007 indeed romanticizes its violence by attaching it to the trope 
of the heroic WWII soldier. The game implemented this attachment by suggesting historical 
authenticity via an attention to historical artifacts and a double-address of player and player-
character that embedded gameplay into an overarching quasi-historical story of American 

 
132 
 
 
success, unchangeable by death or failure, and as a result dislocated its violence from the present. 
This proved to be a crucial innovation over former FPSs, which had provided no ideological 
justification for their detailed displays of blood and gore and came under public scrutiny for 
allegedly encouraging school shootings. Medal of Honor’s less problematic re-visitation of U.S. 
battles was based on the James Bond game GoldenEye007 by Nintendo, a company that had 
been deemed to be family friendly in public and political discourse. It tethered the physically 
engaging immersion of the player to wholesome American ideologies and laid the groundwork 
for the ‘bad object’ of the FPS to become more broadly accepted. 
My last chapter will explore how the PC FPS Call of Duty (2003) continued to 
ideologically and historically frame virtual violence as an access to past American success. 
Emerging after the traumatic event of 9/11 and its resulting ethically convoluted military actions 
in the Middle East, CoD immersed its players into the mythological past of WWII as the just 
multinational effort against the evils of Nazi Germany.

CHAPTER IV 
Call of Duty (2003): Immersion and Historical Realism 
 
With Call of Duty, a second franchise revolving around FPSs representing World War II 
entered the market in 2003, quickly establishing itself as the Medal of Honor series’ strongest 
competitor. A migration of creative talent from Electronic Arts (frequently shortened to EA) to 
Activision’s CoD creating studio Infinity Ward established a connection between the new 
franchise and the heritage of historical representation found in this dissertation.71 Activision staff 
claimed in an interview that the company planned to profit from FPS’s strong sales by emulating 
proven modes of representation including its realism and immersive mechanics. 
Beforehand, in May 2002, about two-and-a-half years after the original game, Medal of 
Honor (1999), EA published Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. It was the WWII FPS franchise’s72 
third release and its first installment for PC, rather than for the PlayStation. The year’s sixth best-
                                                
71 Members of the game’s developer 2015, Inc., most notably development director Vince Zampella and engineering 
lead Jason West, soon left Electronic Arts due to unhappiness with the company’s leadership and payment issues 
(Dring). According to its members, however, the creative unit itself had been functioning well. Allied Assault level 
designer and writer Zied Rieke recalls: “We had bonded as a team, but decided we wanted to work with new 
management. Many members of the team were actually going to leave to find new jobs, regardless of potential 
royalties coming in from Medal of Honor” (ibid). As a result, the team largely remained intact in its transition to 
new leadership, establishing a sense of continuity in labor between the two franchises.

selling video game,73 it received much critical acclaim from magazines like Computer 
Gaming World and GameSpy 
Electronic Arts’ most direct competitor, game publisher Activision, signed much of 
Allied Assault’s development team, grouping them into a new development studio they named 
Infinity Ward, a move that did not go unnoticed in game magazines. Computer Gaming World 
acknowledged: “Infinity Ward is comprised or more than 20 former members of ‘2015’, the 
company that developed Allied Assault” (35). Activision tasked the new studio to develop a 
game thematically and generically similar to Allied Assault in order to expand their North 
America-heavy game sales to include more international success,74 assuming WWII to be a 
universally attractive setting (Dring). The publisher was not shy in communicating that it was 
looking for its own version of Allied Assault. Scott Dodkins, Activision’s vice president at the 
time, remembers the company’s wish to “get the men that made Medal of Honor to make a 
version of Medal of Honor but under a different name . . .” (Dring). 
By combining quasi-cinematic aesthetics with a references to historical artifacts, Call of 
Duty and its marketing materials set out to construct an immersive player experience, the 
narrative of which reinforces and reinterprets the U.S.-centric ideology of Medal of Honor’s 
‘Greatest Generation’ discourse. 
Game publications noticed the similarity between the games at the time of Call of Duty’s 
release, primarily citing issues of intellectual property, rather than its content, as the reason 
                                                
73 https://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_030128a.htm 
74 In the years preceding Call of Duty (2003), Activision had mostly published tie-in game versions of U.S.-
American film productions like The Lion King: Simba’s Mighty Adventure (2000), lines of games based on Marvel’s 
X-Men (2000, 2000b, 2001, 2001b, 2002) and the Star Trek (1999, 2000, 2000b, 2001, 2001b) franchises, as well as 
a game based on Spielberg’s Minority Report (2002)

Activision did not release the game under the Medal of Honor brand. Computer Gaming World 
(10/03) wrote: 
So why don’t they call it Medal of Honor 2? Because EA . . . own the right to that 
franchise . . . [Infinity Ward] have the experience and talent to improve on the MOH 
experience, and they have something to prove: They want to build a better WWII shooter 
and beat EA at its own game. (100) 
Activision had formerly focused on settings like Soldier of Fortune’s (2000) nuclear terrorist 
hunt and the science fiction/fantasy shooters Quake II (1997) and Quake III Arena (1999), as 
well as the fictionalized WWII shooter Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001).  
The success of Allied Assault, as well as assumptions about a general world-wide 
attractiveness of WWII games might have well driven Activision’s new choice of a more 
realistic WWII setting for their next FPS. The game’s narrative, distributed along the lines of the 
American, British and Russian war efforts nearly equally, rather than focusing on a single heroic 
soldier in the tradition of Medal of Honor, confirms this suspicion.  
However, media scholar Tent Cruz (2007) suggests that, at least in the case of the United 
States, the increasingly tangled and convoluted ethics of post-9/11 military actions constituted an 
ideal cultural environment for WWII-nostalgia and the simple ethical context of its culturally 
formed narratives. He writes:  
The terrifying uncertainty of [the war on terror and the occupation of Iraq] contrasts with 
the popular history of the Second World War, a war with clearly defined roles: Allied 
soldiers versus Axis soldiers, democracy (and communism) versus fascism, with armies 
of relatively equal size and technological sophistication pitted against each other. While 
the Second World War was undoubtedly much more complex than these simple binaries 
imply, the popular understanding of the war, as represented by mainstream films, 
documentaries, books, and video games, is one of good versus evil. (n.p.) 
 
Sociologist and game journalist Hartmut Gieselmann (2007) adds the perspective of quasi-utopic 
masculine national community to this scenario: “The new message [of WWII shooters like Call 
of Duty] was: It is a man’s duty to go to war, the nation is a big family and it is an honor to kill 

 
136 
 
 
and to die for your country. . . In games, military comradeship appears to be stronger even than 
ideological views” (n.p.).75 As I will show, however, the theme of comradeship is very much part 
of the game’s ideology. 
Indeed, the platoon-based, rather than lone-wolf-style, combat of the first Call of Duty 
game emphasizes masculine community by grouping the player-character with a squad of 
friendly military characters in much of the game’s three single-player campaigns, and its 
narrative tropes thus connected more strongly to conventional WWII cinema like Saving Private 
Ryan and its cast of characters (see chapter II) than Medal of Honor’s evocation of the spy 
thriller.  
In The World War II Combat Film: Anatomy of a Genre (2003), Jeanine Basinger 
underlines this connection when she defines the geographically, racially and intellectually mixed 
squad as a major trope of WWII combat cinema: “[E]ach of these men plays a traditional role 
that defines the internal structure of the combat story” (53). Her comments highlight the 
centrality of masculine community for the WWII film, and shows how Call of Duty’s ‘squad’ 
gameplay finds its counterparts in cinema history.  
The game’s campaigns included the perspective of three different Allied countries— 
arguably playing to a post-9/11 desire for scenarios of nation-based international community in 
the face of the convoluted politics of the Middle Eastern wars. In its representations of the U.S., 
U.K., and Russian war efforts, however, the game’s narrative featured clear ideological 
distinctions between the three, reinforcing the idea of the American soldiers as driven by 
                                                
75 It should, however, be noted that the same historical moment of uncertainty is also being credited with a later shift 
of the focus of the FPS to narratives of troubled Middle Eastern deployments. Media scholar Peter Mantello writes: 
“Like the vague and nebulous formulas for which real-world policy-makers and war planners communicate and 
prosecute the War on Terror, the post-9/11 MS video game increasingly relies on imaginary frameworks and 
speculative future threats that indirectly appeal to present-day concerns . . .” (Mantello, 486).

heroism, the UK soldiers as driven by duty, and the Russian soldiers acting in the face of 
coercion and risk of violence at the hands of their superiors, in other words, serving as an 
extension of the Cold War by ideologically pitting capitalism against communism.  
In this final chapter, I will conclude this dissertation’s analysis of the WWII FPS and its 
immersive qualities. What began as a highly fictionalized “bad object” (see my analysis of 
Wolfenstein 3D (1992)) grew into a quasi-educational representation of historic events, in part 
motivated by Saving Private Ryan’s (1998) immersive bodily address, with meaningful changes 
from Medal of Honor (1999) to Call of Duty (2003). As I argue, the game’s aesthetics wed the 
bodily address of its immersive gameplay to traditional cinematic representations of WWII, 
evoking the materiality of historical objects like weapons and analogue film to establish a mode 
of historical realism (see chapter III). At the same time, in a reflection of US-centric historical 
accounts, it builds a hierarchy of heroism between the USA, the UK, and Communist Russia, 
while highlighting international community as the war’s historical heritage. 
The game’s reception in the press highlighted both its immersive nature and its presumed 
authenticity by referencing its squad-based gameplay and intensity, that approximating that of 
the historical event, as well as its recreations of military objects and battle spaces. Computer 
Gaming World praises the “game’s team-based design [, which] succeeds so well you'll often 
find yourself worrying about your NPC buddies . . .” (103). Followed by a litany of featured 
weapons, the magazine points out that all the weapons in Call of Duty are “authentic to both the 
era as well as the army you're fighting with” (103). In a report from the E3 game expo, PC 
Gamer notes that the player-character’s comrades “feel like a crucial part of the action, and the 
resulting immersion is incredible” (12), and two issues later (10/03) it praises the game’s “gritty 
realism,” that perfectly captures “what the applicable forces had to endure during the war” (22): 

 
138 
 
 
“[i]t’s a gripping experience that’ll leave your heart racing, […] capturing the intensity of WWII 
like no game before it” (23). That realism and immersion are constantly cited as the game’s 
major selling points makes one wonder about the relationship between the two. A central overlap 
between the concepts appears to be the construction of the game world, and whether a diegesis 
possesses the power to stand in for physical realities (past or present) to the extent that it 
supports the player’s ability to suspend disbelief. As I argue, the perception of agency that 
conforms to expectations shaped by the game’s setting and a type of aesthetic verisimilitude that 
governs its diegesis represent design choices of gameplay and aesthetics that promote 
immersion. 
In her 2016 revision of Hamlet on the Holodeck, Janet Murray claims that matching the 
scripts of coding the actions of the digital world and cueing the player’s actions appropriately 
results in the feeling of agency (144), which, as she argues, can result from a tight match of 
controller and screen actions (138). In historically-themed games like Call of Duty, this 
‘appropriateness’ of player-agency is largely determined by matching the agency of the 
represented historical subject. According to Adam Chapman (2016) this results in “historical 
resonance” (36), which I will explore further when discussing the game’s aesthetics in concrete 
examples. The term describes “the establishment of a link between a game’s historical 
representation and the larger historical discourse, as the player understands it” (36), including, as 
I argue, appropriate levels of agency determined by the player-character. Immersion can result 
from the experience of an authentic world that suggests a level of agency appropriate for its 
historical setting. Unlike Medal of Honor’s superspy narrative, the protagonists in Call of Duty 
almost constantly need support by friendly NPCs, or, more frequently, they enact necessary 
actions to support their fellow troops’ forward momentum through space. “In the war that 

 
139 
 
 
changed the world, no one fought alone” (see my discussion of the Call of Duty packaging 
below), the game’s box art proclaims, linking the limitations of the player-character’s agency to 
the “band of brothers” narrative that had been well established in Hollywood’s representations of 
battle, the game’s “larger historical discourse.” 
Immersion thus partly rests on the game mechanics’ suggestion of historical realism, as 
expectations about agency during the past event are applied to the game’s facilitation of agency 
during game play. Meeting these expectations that were shaped by popular media does not, 
however, merely apply to the game’s mechanics but involves its aesthetics. 
Baron (2010) describes the inclusion of indexical, archival images in games as possessing 
“archive effect.” It is important to note that the archive effect constitutes an “experience” of 
archivalness, a suggestion of temporal disparity, rather than its actual presence. As a fictional 
construct, it allows media to “be imbued by the viewer with various evidentiary values as they 
are appropriated and repurposed…” (Ibid.). Like Call of Duty’s mechanics, the archive effect’s 
aesthetics similarly draw on a “larger historical discourse” to construct an immersive world.  
Again, this discourse is to a large extent found in Hollywood war film. Tanine Allison 
(2018) mentions a reviewer who claims that games like Call of Duty make players feel like 
“you’re in your own war movie” (164). Indeed, the game draws on the war film genre’s tropes in 
terms of narrative, iconography and the use of “evidence and historical references as strategies of 
authentication” (168-9). The last element, in particular, highlights the use of the archive effect, 
referring to its use in Hollywood films like Saving Private Ryan, and the historical event itself, 
even though they tend to be embedded between levels of gameplay that offer meaningful agency 
(169). While Call of Duty indeed locates the use of the archive effect outside of gameplay, I 
argue that its occurrence in framing texts shape the experience of play even in promotional 

 
140 
 
 
materials, the game’s strategy guide, and reviews. Thus, I will include these texts to highlight not 
only their expression of the game’s ideology, but the ways in which they shape player 
expectations. 
Given the game’s reliance on platoon-based gameplay, my analysis of Call of Duty’s 
single player campaign will explore the implementation of NPCs. Their inclusion was a response 
to Activision’s explicit desire to offer a Medal of Honor-style PC game that would appeal to an 
audience beyond the U.S. by infusing an immersive experience of play in the FPS genre.76 I 
argue that Call of Duty’s immersive gameplay experience is fueled by perceptual and 
psychological character-identification77 and a mode of historical realism based on (1) references 
to popular representations of WWII (in particular to The Longest Day (1962) and Saving Private 
Ryan (1998)), which substitute the physical historical spaces they represent, (2) the use of the 
“Archive Effect” (Baron 2013) and, (3) a narrative which confirms popular U.S. centric WWII 
accounts that emphasize the heroism of American troops in contrast to other allied soldiers.  
By exploring the game’s marketing materials, contemporary reception, framing controls 
(the player’s virtual embodied hinge between the material and the virtual via keyboard and 
mouse), narrative and aesthetics (the game’s representation of historical space), I will show that 
Call of Duty does not resolve the possible tension of virtual embodied subjective access to 
history and the allegedly objective material historicity of the game’s diegesis by assigning them 
to separate aspects of the game like framing controls (subjective hinge of the non-diegetic 
interface) and aesthetics (in an allegedly ‘objective’ mode of historical realism). Rather, the

game design allows the player to engage with these aspects from a middle ground between the 
player’s physical and the player-character’s virtual body. As a result, the player actions work 
together with the game’s representations to construct an immersive experience of a certain mode 
of historical realism, rather than merely serving as a motor for enjoyable gameplay. I will only 
sporadically touch on the issue of whether or not the represented events indeed successfully 
epitomize the historic events. Rather, my interest lies in the game as a work of rhetoric (White 
1987), allowing the player to experience a mode of historical realism as a catalyst for immersion, 
independent of whether this realism accurately represents historical events. Similar to my 
analyses of Wolfenstein 3D and Medal of Honor, I will demonstrate how Call of Duty represents 
another iteration of the use of immersion as an—at least commercially—accepted mode for 
WWII historiography. Focusing on the elements mentioned above, I will not include the game’s 
multiplayer mode, soundtrack and menus in my analysis. 
 
Game Packaging and Strategy Guide: Embodiment and Historical Realism 
 
Box Art 
Given the game’s status as a commodity, its presentation to potential buyers serves as an 
important means of advertising and visually condensing the included content. This is even more 
the case with CoD, since at the time of its release, physical purchases at a store were the single 
means of acquiring the game. Commercial game downloads of AAA games (i.e. games with 
large budgets for development and marketing) only becoming a broadly-used distribution 
strategy years later. 
The art and the language of the original Call of Duty’s (2003) game box (Figure 55) 
highlights its reliance on allegedly historically authentic WWII narratives via a rhetoric that 
visually and verbally restages the game’s immersive continuum between player and game. At the 

 
142 
 
 
same time, it anticipates Call of Duty’s narrative framework of masculine (national) community 
as constitutive of the experience of gameplay, a framework that constitutes a cornerstone of its 
mode of historical realism, while also highlighting the efforts of the U.S. troops, rather than the 
other featured campaigns. 
The cover art is a point-of-view depiction of an American soldier engaged in battle; the 
gun on the bottom of the image, while connected to the bottom-left soldier, finds its counterpart 
in the FPS’s convention of depicting the gun at the bottom of the screen as a hinge between 
player and game (Klevjer 2006). The soldier on the right side of the image points his finger 
directly toward and yells at the viewer. Doing so, this image restages Uncle Sam’s WWI “I want 
you” recruiting poster with a sense of heightened urgency. Proceeding from the bottom to the 
top, the cover maps out a trajectory from self to other: the very bottom contains the gun, 
functioning as a hinge between viewer and image, while further upwards, a faceless soldier is 
seen firing in the direction of battle. Scanning further upwards, the soldier pointing his finger at 
the viewer reinforces the sense of presence by engaging the viewer via communication. 
Additionally, in the middle ground, two soldiers that are shooting from cover toward the enemy 
represent the first instance of conflict, connecting foreground and background. These four 
characters (and the “viewer’s gun”) are connected via common low-key lighting and framed by 
the ruins of a house, staging presence and masculine community in a mutual visual space defined 
by shared lighting and architecture.  
Beyond these walls, the top half of the image constitutes the space of conflict in which 
the self and its allies encounter the other-as-enemy: it is a brightly lit open space, marked as an 
area of conflict by seven gunshots, an explosion on the right, contained by ruins, and a fire far in 
the background. This trajectory from self to address of the self, to friendly soldiers, to an 

 
143 
 
 
aesthetically demarcated, relatively anonymous field of conflict with the other, metaphorically 
restages the mechanics of immersion via a fluid continuum between the viewer and their 
 
Figure 55: Call of Duty's (2003) packaging 
American squad. This constitutes a manifesto of Call of Duty’s immersive mechanics located--
quite literally--front and center of the game’s marketing materials. At the same time, the clearly 
defined space in which the game’s communication occurs evokes masculine community as 
gameplay’s constitutive framework.  
Game Description and Reception 
The language used on the back of the box also suggests the CoD’s ability to engage the 
player’s body and immerse it into historical events, wedding the themes of immersion and 
historical realism. “Intense battlefield moments” promise to “put you in the heat of the action,” 
with PC Gamer’s review certifying the game to be “the most intense WWII shooter ever.” 
Strikingly, this intensity is a “cinematic” one: “experience the cinematic intensity of World War 

 
144 
 
 
II’s epic battles . . .”, it invites the reader, describing those battles as “authentic combat 
missions.” The hinge between bodily engagement and realism in Call of Duty, as described by 
the box, thus rests on the evocation of cinematic representations of battle. 
At the same time, the text alludes to Call of Duty’s squad-based game mechanics 
representing a sense of community: “In the war that changed the world, no one fought alone” 
(see also my discussion of realism and immersion above) is written in front of the American flag, 
introducing the category of ‘nation’ as one of this community’s frameworks. Unpacking this 
language and imagery reveals several claims about the game:  
First, and most obviously, they present Call of Duty to be exciting and immersive. Both 
the repeated references to intensity and the direct placement of the player within the “heat of the 
action” constitute a thematic echo of the cover art’s “Uncle Sam” gesture, promising to immerse 
the player in the game by engaging/addressing their body.  
 Second, they portray Call of Duty’s squad-based gameplay as a direct extension of 
historic events and their cinematic representations. Since “[i]n the war that changed the world, no 
one fought alone,” the game’s mechanics echo these allegedly historical dynamics of masculine 
community, aesthetically framing them as citizen-soldiers by referencing the American nation 
via the flag. Debra Ramsey (2015) draws on this fact when she observes that Call of Duty 
introduces “the idea of the soldier as a member of a ‘brotherhood’ forged in the extreme spaces 
of combat” (99). Call of Duty’s official strategy guide (2004) explicitly frames this brotherhood 
as a historical fact represented by the game, suggesting that the game’s focus on squad-based 
play allows it to draw from authentic combat strategies: “[T]he designers have brought squad-
level gameplay to life like it has never been done before. In Call of Duty, you’re part of a squad, 
working together to achieve a common goal. As such, there are some real-world tactics and rules 

 
145 
 
 
that you should know” (4). According to the guide, the fact that “real-world tactics” help the 
player to succeed in gameplay is a direct result of its squad-based gameplay, i.e., these 
mechanics represent dynamics within the “real-world” brotherhood-based historic event. It thus 
evokes, and subsequently downplays the significance of cinematic mediation. 
Third, rather than claiming that the game recreates film’s representations of battle, the 
marketing materials allege that the historic battles themselves possessed “cinematic intensity.” 
This wording conflated cinematic representation with the historical event, framing the tropes of 
visual realism used by films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) as markers for authenticity. Since 
this ideological discourse posits cinematic representation to be a privileged, hyper-real access to 
history, it follows that there is an expectation that a type of historical realism will follow from 
using cinematic aesthetics. As I will show, many of CoD’s missions have indeed been the subject 
of film and television, and the game design builds on these representations and their visual and 
narrative tropes. 
My three points underline the game’s claims to historical realism via its squad-based 
mechanics, which make it possible to apply historic military strategies of community-based 
battle within a ‘cinematically authentic’ aesthetic setting, and promise a physically engaging, 
immersive mode of play. The conflation of cinematic convention with historical events in WWII 
FPSs has been noted in scholarly analyses: in interviews with self-described gamers, 
anthropologist Scott A. Lukas (2010) found that people “expressed that what makes combat 
believable, such as in the Call of Duty series, is the use of effects that are common to similar 
period films like Saving Private Ryan (1998)” (86). As mentioned in my introduction, according 
to Kingsepp (2006), the games “connote the Saving Private Ryan version of Omaha beach rather 

 
146 
 
 
than the well-known documentary images that are almost exactly replicated in the film” (ibid). 
Call of Duty’s cinematic opening sequence serves as a first example of this. 
Cinematic Moments: Call of Duty’s Opening Montage 
 
Space in Call of Duty is organized around both non-interactive and interactive 
configurations: the opening montage constitutes a central non-interactive moment, while the 
explorable game space itself offers interactive play with more meaningful player agency. Both 
configurations serve different purposes for constructing a particular subject position: the 
moments characterized by little player agency infuse the game with markers of authenticity by 
referencing the authority of photographic indexicality, while also presenting its ideological 
agenda. 
Aesthetically disconnecting Call of Duty’s opening sequence from the playable missions 
establishes a dichotomy between the “authenticity” of its cinematics and the viscerally engaging 
gameplay. Film and media scholar Tanine Allison explores this strategy in her 2010 article “The 
World War II Video Game Adaptation, and Postmodern History”:  
[Such a] sequence places the player outside of history, as a contemporary viewer 
watching cable television and learning about events far in the past. The separation of 
these sequences from the rest of the gameplay reinforces the sense that this . . . footage 
may be authentic, but it is dated and obsolete, while the full-color, interactive combat 
missions of the game are immediate and viscerally engaging. The game may not be 
authentic in the same way this combat footage purports to be, but it does give the 
illusion of presence and interactivity that the older images lack. (189) 
 
Allison’s attention to the game’s dichotomy points to a kind of diacritical realism, in which two 
of its modes—photorealism and visceral realism (see chapter II) claim authenticity by 
distinguishing themselves from each other.  
Call of Duty’s cinematic opening, to some extent located “outside of history,” indeed 
serves to establish a sense of historical realism (or “authenticity,” the closely related concept 

 
147 
 
 
used by Allison). In this way, the opening sequence introduces a type of gameplay that cannot 
compete with the trust generally bestowed on cinematic representations.78 However, it associates 
this aesthetic with images created within the game’s engine, rather than constructing digital 
images in a distinct visual composition. As a result, by making use of gameplay’s visual 
language, the opening infuses these computer-generated images with the authority of mentioned 
“dated and obsolete” depictions and carries them over to the visuals of play. 
 
The opening montage begins with the virtual camera moving over six black and white 
images that were created within the game’s engine, rather than with a camera, fading into each 
other. They show tanks attacking a city, a Russian flag being raised among rubble, soldiers 
running through a town, a soldier firing in front of a church, troops in the trenches and troops 
running up the hill. Some of these images were edited to evoke photography’s materiality 
through folds in its ‘paper’ (         Figure 56).  
 
         Figure 56: Cinematic Opening

A gradually appearing caption reads: “In the war that changed the world, victory was not 
achieved by one man, but by the lives of many.” The montage then moves on to show low-
saturation moving images (evoking the materiality of film stock) of battle without added 
captions: an aerial shot of soldiers running through the snow and the ruins of Moscow, carrying a 
bright red Russian flag. The flag carrier is shown to be shot down, falling to his death. It then 
shifts to the Western front, revealing burned out French hotels, troops shooting machine guns out 
of a window and running through a field. Finally, a virtual helicopter shot shows bombers 
attacking war ships, and wounded soldiers. In slightly more saturated images, we then see 
soldiers running toward the camera in slow motion, surrounded by bombed out buildings, an 
aerial shot of tanks in the snow, a town square in rubble, soldiers in the countryside, a charging 
anti-aircraft gun, a church steeple, and the Berlin Reichstag. The captions for this sequence read: 
“Across the battlefields of Europe, many nations united to reach one goal: Berlin.” Finally, the 
screen fades to black and the title “Call of Duty” appears in its branded silver-gray font, 
explicitly tying the images to the game. 
 
This opening montage evokes historical photographs and film, i.e. the “dated and 
obsolete” footage mentioned by Allison. It shows black and white images created within the 
game’s engine, and by providing a written commentary that depicts the war as a common effort 
of many individuals, rather than single men, it anticipates the game’s three distinct campaigns 
from the U.S., UK and Russia perspective.  
Since the images in Call of Duty’s opening sequence are not digitized historical 
photographs, but electronically constructed, the temporal disparity of “then” and “now” (see my 
discussion of Baron 2010 above) does not manifest itself in a tension between game and image. 
Instead, both temporal dimensions are co-present in the digital image itself as it had been infused 

 
149 
 
 
with materiality: it combines computer-generated images with the materiality of photography, 
including its objects’ flatness, black-and-white color scheme, and wear-and-tear. As a result, it 
evokes a viewer experience between the indexical and the digital; artificial images are overlaid 
with signifiers of materiality which thus establish a ‘divided’ viewer position. The trope of 
materiality functions as an evidentiary claim of authenticity the digital images themselves were 
unable to provide and blurs the lines between “then” and “now,” history and its representation. In 
spite of the strategic placement of indexical images outside of gameplay, these images still 
influence the reading of gameplay’s visuals as they specifically work to inscribe them. 
The strategy, antagonizing the general suspicion of digital images as opposed to the trust 
bestowed on photographic imagery, allows the montage of images to serve as proof for their 
captions, which reject war as a narrative of individuals in favor of a pan-national effort, carried 
out by a multiplicity of heroic troops. By doing so, the Call of Duty franchise’s first installment 
differentiates itself from its major competitor Medal of Honor. Debra Ramsay (2015) confirms 
this when she writes:  
[T]he first Call of Duty … initiated changes to the mainstream narrative of World War II. 
For the most part, Medal of Honor reflects the dominant cultural story of the war by 
concentrating on the actions of the heroic individual American soldier and consequently 
marginalizing the experiences of soldiers of other nationalities. In contrast, 
activision.com asserts that Call of Duty refracts World War II ‘through the eyes of citizen 
soldiers and unsung heroes from an alliance of countries.’ (98) 
 
The captions add to a sense of authenticity vis-à-vis the implicitly rejected, historically highly 
rare, lone-soldier/spy experience of the Medal of Honor series. 
As the montage moves on to moving images, its evidentiary function now emphasizes the 
‘cinematic’ quality of the game, serving as verisimilitude to history’s “cinematic battles” (see 
above). Kingsepp (2006) claims that the aesthetics of Saving Private Ryan have become such a 
pervasive trope in the representation of WWII that alluding to them results in nearly the same 

 
150 
 
 
experience as depicting the historical battles with no such proxy. However, the experience of 
shifting from the simulated textuality of historical documents to the tropes of Saving Private 
Ryan cannot be simply explained by motivating a different set of culturally established signifiers 
of the ‘real’. That is even more the case, since this part of the montage quickly moves between 
different scenarios that do not allow for a unified text. Its nod toward Hollywood cinema aims to 
produce the epic nature and visceral response of the films’ battle scenes, particularly as 
condensed in their cinematic trailers, rather than the film’s tropes that have come to connote 
authenticity. After having established its particular (allegedly more authentic) portrayal of the 
multinational troops as groups rather than individuals, the game now lays claim to the kind of 
excitement and representational authority associated with big budget Hollywood productions, 
WWII’s “cinematic intensity” the box text had promised. 
The rhetorical strategy of Call of Duty’s opening cinematics thus lays claim to historical 
realism by emulating the material nature of historical documents (i.e. photographs), which it 
incorporates into images created within the game’s engine that functions as the basis of the 
game’s later immersive gameplay, blurring the lines between the two and infusing the game’s 
visuals with the indexical authority of said images. It acknowledges the war as a pan-national 
effort and uses visual tropes of trusted WWII representations in film. Finally, via text, it connects 
the game’s space-driven play to historical events by assigning a travel-based narrative to these 
texts.  
 
Immersion and its Challenges in Call of Duty 
 
As laid out in my Introduction and echoed in chapter III, scholars have challenged the 
notion that FPSs, with their primary perspective of a continuous POV-shot (see introduction), 

 
151 
 
 
constitute a uniquely immersive genre. It is true that the FPS’s lack of an active on-screen actor 
can hinder the player’s self-projection onto the player-character and thus presents an obstacle to 
immersion. This constellation can render the player a participant observer, highly engaged in the 
actions of the game but disconnected spatially and in regard to identification. Call of Duty 
addresses this issue of spatial immersion in its tutorial level by blurring the lines between the 
player-characters’ actions and the player’s abstract controls that trigger them via Non-Player-
Characters.  
These NPCs diegeticize said abstract controls by addressing player and player-character 
simultaneously, constructing a subject position that conflates the non-diegetic with the diegetic, 
drawing the player into a game world marked by tropes of historical authenticity, making up for 
the visual barrier of immersion represented by the screen as described by scholars like Laurie 
Taylor (see Introduction). This shift into diegesis resembles the strategy guide’s claims to 
historical realism where the mechanics of squad-based battle allow the player to experience 
aspects of historical warfare within its virtual representations. Adapting Dan Pinchbeck’s (2009) 
categorization of NPCs, I will show how these characters serve to offer a type of immersive 
experience facilitated by gameplay and visuals, while also serving the end of historical realism, 
confirming the game’s own claim to the idea that “victory was not achieved by one man.” 
 
NPCs and PNPCs 
Experimental game designer and game scholar Dan Pinchbeck (2009) defines NPCs as 
agents with some form of individuality that are recognizable as separate characters from the 
background population. Other than their representation (i.e. to whether they appear in cut-scenes 

 
152 
 
 
or in-game), Pinchbeck organizes NPCs, or PNPCs,79 according to the functions they serve 
within the game’s diegesis. Their main function, according to Pinchbeck, lies in their ability to 
serve as “goal-communication and manipulation devices,” broken down into the following 
categories, to which I will refer in my analyses of CoD’s gameplay: 
 
a) Explicit instruction (“go here and do that”), an epistemological schema that 
simplifies gameplay by attaching significant markers to the ongoing action. By 
drawing the player’s attention to actions that drive the gameplay forward within 
the diegesis, rather than explicitly addressing its underlying abstract system, the 
game’s creators exercise control over the player’s attention and behavior and, by 
extension, affect. The player is often rewarded for paying attention to PNPCs, 
which opens up the potential for more complex affective experiences. Call of 
Duty uses this function frequently—as I will show below, the player is repeatedly 
ordered by NPCs to use weapons only available to the player-character. 
b) Virtual expansion of affordances,80 i.e., allowing the player to perform an action 
by proxy, which the player-character itself is unable to perform. Transferring the 
action from the player-character to a PNPC not only redistributes the action itself, 
but also its attached thought: the avatar is framed as a body, not a mind. The 
underlying epistemological message that the player does not have to think about 
the why and the how of his actions, as these will be externally supplied, makes the 
                                                
79 Pinchbeck defines a subcategory of NPCs, Persistent NPCs (PNPCs), as NPCs “presented in the diegesis who 
appear repeatedly or have a definable role in the world and plot” and which are, to an extent, “defined by diegetic 
significance rather than representation” (ibid.). 
80 Affordances, as broadly defined by Chapman (2016, see below), are “opportunities for action” (74). 

 
153 
 
 
player surrender decision-making power to the system: “The avatar's role is to 
supply the embodiment, not the mind. In a not insignificant number of cases, 
PNPCs determine where to go next and what to do next . . .” (271). The 
perception of the PNPC as a body goes beyond Pinchbeck’s concerns about 
player-system politics of power. Framing the player-character (or “avatar”) as a 
body defines gameplay as an embodied, immersive experience via a continuum 
between the “mind” of the player and the “body” of the player-character. 
c) Their most indirect functions: offering contextual support and continuity, 
fulfilling a vital role in ensuring that the player’s actions are successfully 
supported by the environment. “This leads to a semantic, schematic justification 
of the occurrences presented in the game. When context is described, in effect, the 
idea of the ‘atmosphere’ of the game is being essentially recast in terms that are 
ludological” (272). 
I will now analyze Call of Duty’s first game space, a recreation of a 1940s U.S. Army 
boot-camp, using these three categories to explore its construction of an immersive experience in 
the mode of historical realism within the context of teaching the player how to control their 
player-character Private Martin, and by extension teaching him how to be an effective soldier 
and platoon member. The mission counters the immersive shortcomings of the FPS genre, 
connecting the player’s non-diegetic use of mouse- and keyboard-controls to the diegetic 
experiences of the player-character. It does so by using Non-Player-Characters, while employing 
the aesthetics of WWII propaganda art and references to military movies to establish the mode of 
historical realism, infusing the game with authority regarding its historical depictions. 
 

 
154 
 
 
NPCs and Historical Realism in Camp Toccoa 
 
The game’s first space that can be relatively freely explored by the player is set in a 
representation of Camp Toccoa, GA, which was used by the U.S. Army beginning in 1942. It 
introduces the player—and the American campaign’s player-character Private Martin—to the 
game’s controls. Two NPCs explicitly instruct—Campbell’s category a) of NPCs—both the 
player-character Private Martin to perform actions central to gameplay, and the player to trigger 
these actions via the game’s peripherals, i.e. via keyboard and mouse, while Martin’s comrades 
offer narrative context, i.e., Campbell’s category c). 
The first NPC, Captain Foley, introduces basic movement through space (controlled via 
the keyboard), control of the player-character’s virtual camera (via the mouse) and how to 
engage with the game’s systems of information.81 In his address, he conflates the player, who 
possesses access to non-diegetic information, with the player-character, whose virtual body is 
based within the game’s diegesis. Using dialogue, Foley’s character narratively tethers the 
player’s non-diegetic controls of mouse and keyboard to Private Martin’s actions, extending the 
game’s diegesis to the player’s controls and offering an experience of unity of the player’s 
physical and the game’s virtual world. As a result, Call of Duty achieves both perceptual and 
psychological immersion82 by merging the player and their use of abstract controls with the 
player-character present in the game’s diegesis. 
                                                
81 For an in-depth discussion of the FPS’s controls, in particular the distribution of camera-control and movement 
through space, see this dissertation’s introduction. 
82 see my Introduction’s discussion of Gaut (2006) 

 
155 
 
 
At first, Captain Foley’s instructions and the non-diegetic controls appear to be neatly 
separated by diegetic dialogue and non-diegetic on-screen text:83 Foley’s audio command to 
“read each of these important signs” is juxtaposed with non-diegetic on-screen text attaching this 
command to game controls: “Use your mouse to look at the large five signs!” As the player 
moves the character from sign to sign, they encounter an aesthetic designed to resemble 
historical military propaganda posters, which portray gameplay strategies in a visual language 
suggesting authentic 1940s’ instruction: 
“Use grenades to flush out hard points,” “Attack Attack Attack. Move together as a 
team,” “Always reload before going into battle!” “Suppress the flank,” and, showing the 
image of a makeshift grave, “Don’t make the same mistake! Always move from cover to 
cover” (Figure 57 and Figure 58). 
 
 
In their double-address, these instructions ask both the player and the player-character to 
use (virtual) grenades before moving into heavily protected territory, to keep close to comrades 
(i.e. NPCs), to avoid reloading during battle, to use suppressing fire in order to incapacitate the 
enemy’s flank, and to seek cover rather than be exposed to hostile fire by blindly charging 
toward the enemy. Creating a historical palimpsest, the instructions present themselves as part of 
authentic soldier training by drawing on visual representations of the game’s historical period 
and by adapting dialogue from films depicting the Vietnam War, which featured the hardships of 
boot-camp as a far more common narrative trope than WWII film. Only a few WWII focused 
films, such as The Girl He Left Behind (1956) and Baby Blue Marine (1976), narratively feature 
boot camps but also do not focus on battle. 
This use of quasi-historical artifacts increases the historical game world’s cohesiveness 
by matching its dialogue: one poster is a modified replication of John Vickery’s 1942 poster His 
                                                
83 This visual analysis assumes that – unlike in the chapter’s screenshots - the player does not use the option to 
display dialogue subtitles. 

 
156 
 
 
life is in your hands (Figure 59), which actually addressed the home front’s work force, rather 
than the troops. This does not require the player to be familiar with the original poster, in fact, a 
lack of familiarity renders the cohesiveness more effective. Its inclusion creates historical 
resonance. 
At the same time, however, the instructions serve as pointers for the player, instructing 
them how to successfully navigate the game’s space according to its design. This double address 
allows the game to create a historically convincing game space that immerses the player by 
framing the abstract controlling actions (“use your mouse”, “press [TAB]”) performed by their 
physical body as part of the game world, immersing the player’s body into its diegesis. As 
Martin goes further into his training, this overlap becomes more apparent. 
After the player has finished looking at the posters, Foley begins to directly address the 
player’s controls: “Now check your objectives: you’ll notice that your current objective is 
highlighted. In addition, the location of your current objective is marked by the star on your 
compass. As you approach your current objective, the star will move towards the center of your 
compass.” This is juxtaposed with the on-screen command “Press [Tab] to see your objectives”, 
which displays the objectives on-screen, overlaying the player’s view of the game space (Figure 
60). In this way, after having established a level of historical resonance, the non-diegetic framing 
controls and visuals become linked to the game world as Captain Foley explicitly addresses these 
controls within the game’s diegesis. While the compass serves as another quasi-historical artifact 
evoking the mode of historical realism, the game mechanics anachronistically project a virtual 
GPS with mission markers onto it. This creates two simultaneous visually readable layers of 
time, which bring together the physical present of the player into the in-game representation of 
past time, creating a sense of simultaneity of past time and play time.  

 
157 
 
 
Chapman finds this simultaneity to be a general aim of “realist simulations” of history, 
such as Call of Duty. According to him, these simulations tend to suggest an even ratio of play 
time, i.e., the time passed during game play, fictive time, i.e., the time passed in the game’s 
diegesis, and, important here, past time, i.e., the game’s represented actions as they relate to the 
actions taken by historical subjects (91-93). Of course, and Chapman points this out, it is 
impossible to give a realistic account of past time, as few records exist that would indicate “what 
was done minute-to-minute or second-to-second in the past” (91). In particular, the level of the 
individual, and thus all representations of past time must remain fictions like in this case, in 
which general knowledge about boot camp instruction during WWII is used to construct a 
specific fictional timeframe in its space.  
Captain Foley continues to comment on the game’s framing controls, after which the 
player-character is instructed to “open the gate and run the obstacle course. Go! Go! Go!” The 
dialogue, containing the trope of military dialogue (and competitive sports) “Go! Go! Go!” 
infuses the non-diegetic player controls of mouse and keyboard with diegetic urgency and thus 
significance. This becomes even more concrete during Sgt. Moody’s instructions on weapon 
training. 
Via dialogue, another NPC, Private Elder, is introduced to be a friend of Martin’s. This 
NPC offers contextual support—Campbell’s category c) of NPCs—pointing out that when 
context is described, in effect, the idea of the ‘atmosphere’ of the game is being essentially recast 
in terms that are ludological (272). Martin then runs an obstacle course introducing the player to 
the ability to crouch, crawl and climb over blockades and presenting the corresponding “stance 
indicators” in the HUD (see Introduction). The trope of soldiers being insulted during training, 
here by feminizing them (“Move it, ladies, this is not your Aunt Fanny’s dance . . .”), later by 

 
158 
 
 
comments on Martin’s appearance (“Unless you’re as dumb as you are ugly, it may dawn on you 
that each weapon is good for different situations”) recalls film representations of boot camp, 
primarily in depictions of the Vietnam war, such as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman’s infamous tirade 
in Full Metal Jacket (1987). The references to other media (here to film dialogue, rather than to 
the aesthetics of propaganda posters) that feature the trope of boot-camp hardship open up the 
game to external texts, drawing on a larger generic discourse, and expanding both the game’s 
diegesis and its mode of historical realism.

160 
 
 
 
Figure 60: Mission Objectives 
After finishing the obstacle course, an NPC named Sgt. Moody oversees the player’s 
introduction to weapon controls. During this training, Moody makes explicit references to 
framing controls only visible to the player, not the player-character, such as the Heads-Up-
Display (“The number of rounds in your weapon and the number of rounds you are carrying are 
displayed in the lower right corner of your HUD”), the crosshairs in the middle of the screen 
(“Your accuracy will be defined by the tightness of your crosshairs”), the effect of the player-
character’s position on his shooting (“You will be more accurate while not moving and in the 
crouching or prone positions”), a zoom effect simulating aiming down the gun’s sights (“You 
will notice a slight zoom effect when you raise and aim down the sight of a weapon without a 
scope”), and its effects on the player character’s movements (“Take a few steps while aiming 
down your sight. You’re gonna move slower this way”). He also references that “your weapon 
will reload automatically,” clearly not an available option for the physical gun that is being 
represented here, but part of the game’s abstraction of historical artifacts. 

 
161 
 
 
At the same time, Moody frames some of the games’ mechanics as based in the player-
character’s physical reality, his physical limitations (“Unless you’ve got three hands, you can 
only carry two weapons, besides your sidearm and grenades”) and the risk of permanent death 
(see chapter III), which the game’s mechanics do not allow to occur (“These skills could mean 
your life”).84 As Martin learns to use explosives, a virtual count-down timer in the form of an 
old-fashioned pocket watch appears. Moody warns the player-character: “Note that a stopwatch 
has appeared. This will tell you how much time you have to get your butt out of there, unless you 
want it blown off! Fire in the hole!” The double-address of player and player-character here 
emerges from the presence of the old-fashioned pocket watch that serves as a historical artifact 
invoking the archive effect, and the warning to make sure Martin does not get his ‘butt blown 
off’ (player-character) when it (virtually) ‘appears’ (the player’s points of experience/view). 
So far, immersion and historical realism, two clearly closely related concepts in Call of 
Duty, have emerged from two major sources: First, the NPCs unite the perspective of the 
represented historical subject and of the player by blurring the line between the player’s abstract 
triggers for in-game actions (i.e. keyboard and mouse controls) and the resulting actions of the 
player-character. Thusly, in their instructions, they offer representations of game mechanics in 
the (virtual) flesh. Second, the frequent references to historical artifacts (military posters, pocket 
watch) and other representations of war via generic tropes (drill sergeant address taken from war 
film) establish a sense of historical realism. 
Describing the technology of the game’s represented weapons and historicizing them by 
explaining their place in the overall war effort, the game’s strategy guide suggests another source 
                                                
84 Unlike historical battle, the game does not allow for permanent death – dying during gameplay results in replaying 
the unsuccessful mission, rather than narratively incorporating the player-character’s death, e.g. by assigning a new 
player-character. 

 
162 
 
 
of realism that represents a meaningful shift from successful FPS franchises released before 
Saving Private Ryan. The arsenal of weapons available to the player in Wolfenstein 3D (1992) 
included non-descript weapons like generic machine guns and chain guns, Doom (1993) featured 
a futuristic plasma gun and its bigger version with the tongue-in-cheek name BFG9000 (“Big 
Fucking Gun 9000”), while Heretic (1994) and Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995) similarly 
equipped player-characters and foes with weapons befitting the games’ fantasy genre (“ethereal 
crossbow.” “gauntlets of the necromancer”) and the Star Wars franchise (“thermal detonator,” 
“imperial repeater gun”), respectively.85 Not unlike Medal of Honor’s strategy guide (see chapter 
III), but with a higher emphasis on including historical background, Call of Duty takes pride in 
its representations of specific weapons historically used by axis and allies. Its official strategy 
guide dedicates eight illustrated pages to showcase the game’s twenty-three weapons, explaining 
both their place in history, and, in a smaller section, their tactical in-game use. 
The book’s encyclopedic entries on the weapons (Figure 61) hint at a blur of past time 
and play time similar to the strategies used in Call of Duty’s tutorial level. The description of the 
Sten Guns, which “were developed by Britain to be very simple and inexpensive to create…” 
bleeds into the present time, when the tactical description points out that they are “used in the 
Hurtgen forest missions near the end of the game” (15). Once more, the representation of 
historical artifacts (here a gun, rather than a stop watch) evokes the archive effect, while 
references to game missions and the “end of the game” transport the archive effect into play, 
contributing to its mode of historical realism. 
                                                
85 While some FPSs like GoldenEye007 (1997) and Half-Life (1998) did feature weapons with real-life counterparts 
like James Bond’s Walther PPK pistol and Heckler & Koch MP5K submarine gun in GoldenEye007 and a Glock 
9mm pistol and a .357 Magnum in Half-Life, neither game explicitly uses these weapons to create a sense of 
historical realism within their explicitly fictional, genre-driven diegeses.  

 
163 
 
 
This text illustrates that Call of Duty indulged in a fetishism of wartime technology even 
more explicitly than Medal of Honor (see my discussion of MoH’s strategy guide in chapter IV). 
Future WWII FPSs, even outside of these two major franchises, like Battlefield 1942 (2003) and 
Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 (2006) would join in this focus on historical weaponry, 
underscoring CoD’s significance in the genre’s evolution. 
The game’s missions similarly foreground Call of Duty’s connection to ‘historical’ events 
by being clustered around famous WWII battles, notably Operation Overlord (i.e., the invasion 
 
Figure 61: Call of Duty Strategy Guide 
 
of Normandy by allied troops) and Operation Tonga (i.e., the British efforts within the invasion), 
as well as the Battles of Stalingrad and Berlin. 
 

 
164 
 
 
Campaigns 
The American Campaign—Operation Overlord 
Before gameplay starts, a loading screen informs the player of the first mission’s 
narrative framework by allowing them to steal a glance at Private Martin’s diary. This serves as a 
personalized history lesson, or, in more critical terms, manufactured autobiographical history. 
Both the objects surrounding the diary and Martin’s writing itself include micro and macro-
historical aspects. A combat knife and a Magnum .45, both standard equipment for American 
infantry soldiers like Martin, lie next to Eisenhower’s half-covered D-Day letter to the troops, 
introducing and layering itself into a top-down “great men” perspective of history. Scribbled in 
(arguably Martin’s) handwriting on the letter; however, it reads: “here’s hoping i [sic] make it 
safe. Please Lord protect me” with the letter dating two days before the invasion—“June 4 
1944.” This introduces the idea of the common soldier as a historical actor to the loading screen, 
visualizing this aspect with a black and white photograph of Martin and a fellow paratrooper 
tucked underneath the knife. 
The diary itself similarly covers individual and “great men” views of history. After giving 
an awkwardly didactic account of the pathfinders’ place in the invasion and its in-game 
representation (“The pathfinders land before the main force and place beacons on the landing 
fields to guide the rest of the pilots and paratroopers in”), Martin expresses frustration in having 
been “cooped up [for weeks], and forbidden contact with anyone outside, with nothing to do but 
memorize maps and battle plans,” adding that “we’re all quite eager to be in France.” At the 
same time, he references that “[t]he brass are sending the airborne in first,” and writes that “[a] 
few hours ago, General Eisenhower paid us a visit.”86 The war’s strategists and the soldiers to 
implement these strategies are thusly both addressed in the loading screen, which serves to 
                                                
86 Eisenhower did, in fact, visit the 101st airborne division on the eve of D-Day. 

 
165 
 
 
connect the personalized battle narratives of gameplay with the grand strategic narratives of 
popular historical accounts, once more establishing historical realism, yet one located outside 
immersive gameplay. As I will show later, this personalized introduction, featuring a photograph 
of Martin and the highly personal genre of the diary, constitutes a difference to the introduction 
of the British and the Russian player-characters, who are introduced via military orders that vary 
by appealing to the soldier’s sense of duty and threatening death in the case of deserting. 
 
Figure 62: Martin's Diary (Loading Screen) 
Gameplay and Narrative 
As the level begins, Martin parachutes into the French village “St. Mère Eglise” under the 
cover of darkness. As one might expect, the village is based on an actual place in Normandy, 
from which German troops were flushed out by U.S. paratroopers during Operation Overlord, a 
mission that was popularized by its portrayal in The Longest Day (1962).  
CoD references cinematic representations of WWII in a similar fashion as during the 
opening cinematics and the tutorial level. Upon finding that a fellow soldier carrying a radio 

 
166 
 
 
beacon has fallen to his death, Martin retrieves it from him and activates it in an open field. 
Reacting to the beacon, U.S. transport planes drop a number of paratroopers as German infantry 
soldiers open fire. After the drop zone is secured, Martin and his fellow soldiers move through 
the village, attacking the Germans house by house. Martin is then ordered to disable an attacking 
armored tank-car-hybrid (“half-track”) by shooting its operators, allowing the squad to move 
forward. The next morning, the squad continues to clear the town, with Martin disarming three 
German anti-aircraft guns (“Flakpanzers”) by use of explosives. Just like the guns used by the 
player, the inclusion of the half-track and the Flakpanzers contribute to a sense of historical 
realism. 
While the level opens by taking a “lone wolf” perspective akin to that of Medal of Honor, 
Martin’s work primarily lies in facilitating the movement of his comrades by using equipment 
and achieving objectives unavailable to them. This includes the retrieved radio beacon and the 
explosives used on the Flakpanzers, as well as the neutralization of the half-track. The NPCs 
order Martin to perform those activities —“explicit instruction”—while also serving as 
objectives themselves, being able to move forward due to the player-character’s actions. This 
squad-based combat again establishes a sense of historical realism, as it connects with the 
game’s claims about historic battle.

169 
 
 
The visuals of the Pegasus Bridge mission draw heavily on visual WWII tropes 
established in particular by the film The Longest Day (Figure 63, Figure 64, Figure 65, and 
Figure 66), recreating its exact mise-en-scene via use of props and setting, while the player can 
recreate the film’s camera position and movements by moving the player-character. This differs 
from the continuous flow through space that had been characteristic for the majority of FPSs 
before Call of Duty, which enabled the player to pursue what is often referred to as a run-and-
gun strategy (Grimshaw 2008; Leonard 2010). Rather, Martin’s mission alternates between the 
taking of space, emphasizing movement through and neutralization of enemy positions, and 
defending both taken space and his comrades, emphasizing cover and eliminating attacking 
forces from a relatively static position. His spatial movement through and within St.Mère Eglise 
looks as follows: Move to dead soldier to retrieve beacon from him, move to field to prompt 
fellow paratroopers to land. Defend field from German troops with slow movement toward town. 
Move through town, eliminating enemies. Call of Duty’s squad-based play that relies on a 
multiplicity of NPCs and is linked to the game’s mode of historical realism (see above), thus 
directly influences the game’s function of space. 
At one point in the American campaign, however, historical realism turns into an 
antagonist to the game’s need to make strong returns on Activision’s financial investment, The 
ambition not to omit the Holocaust from the game results in its vastly reductive representation; 
more complete representations of Nazi war crimes would not only pose technological issues, but 
threaten public condemnation, which would likely result in sales issues. 
 
Sanitized Holocaust 
In the sole level to feature allusions to the Holocaust by featuring its visual inventory, 
Call of Duty’s historical realism reveals how the need to sell a great amount of copies overrides 

 
170 
 
 
attempts to recreate historical events in a realistic fashion. Departing from film and media 
scholar Mark Poster’s 1991 term “sanitized war” (222), which describes misleading television 
coverage of the Gulf War, I use the moniker “sanitized Holocaust” to describe this level’s 
representational strategy. Poster suggests that early 1990s’ news coverage, with its “sortie counts 
instead of body counts, has created a soap opera war where … support for the war is the 
discursive effect” (222). I choose to adapt this term, since, similarly to the news segments in 
Poster’s analysis, Call of Duty represents the crimes of Nazi Germany by omitting explicit 
depictions of civilian suffering. Rather, it chooses a visual metonymy, in which the camp’s 
general architecture and general visual inventory of camp imprisonment stand in for its troubling 
events and its subjects, housing one military POW, rather than large groups of civilian inmates. 
By doing so, the game chooses a middle ground between not alluding to the Holocaust at all—a 
stark contrast to the popular understanding of WWII and American motivations—and attempting 
a more realistic representation of the camps, which would have likely resulted in accusations of 
trivializing the events by including them in a PC game.  
Popular representations of WWII, which celebrate America’s entry into the war primarily 
as a response to Nazi crimes and its treatment of Jews specifically, rather than as a political 
reaction to Pearl Harbor, construct this conflict along lines of morality, and present a view of 
American troops as motivated by Germany’s atrocities, rather than by political necessity. Film 
scholar Kathryn R. Kane (1982) comments that the ultimate legitimation of killing, “and one at 
least implicit in most [U.S. combat] films, is that morality lies in one’s purpose and not in one’s 
deeds, that high moral purpose justifies otherwise evil acts. . .” (102). Guy Westwell (2006), a 
film scholar as well, shows that this tendency was strong enough to survive throughout and 
beyond the 1990s: “War continues to be shown--in films such as Pearl Harbor [(2001)], Saving 

 
171 
 
 
Private Ryan [(1998)], Behind Enemy Lines [(2001)], and Black Hawk Down [(2001)] as an 
existential battle between humane, moral individuals and a faceless, fanatical, inhumane enemy” 
(111). Including a setting that shares a great amount of the Holocaust’s visual inventory thus 
contributes to Call of Duty’s attempt to cover the important ideological points of the US war 
effort, while its inability to acknowledge the Nazis’ war crimes illustrates the problematic 
relationship between video games and their ability to engage with troubling subject matters in the 
early 2000s. 
It is easy to imagine that including prisoner NPCs would have faced the game designers 
with additional challenges; besides the additional processing power required, perversely, neither 
the ability to shoot them, nor rendering them invulnerable to friendly fire would result in 
desirable game mechanics, either allowing the player to commit war crimes while playing as an 
American soldier (putting the game’s American “Teen” rating, and thus sales, in jeopardy, while 
likely causing public condemnation), or rendering the level as unconvincing as the absence of 
prisoners altogether. 
As the level taking place in a prison camp begins, Martin has already successfully 
supported the Allied war efforts by destroying many tanks, anti-aircraft guns (“Flak guns”), and 
enemy mortar positions all across the Western front, submitting intelligence by breaking through 
the German lines by car, escorting wounded comrades to safety, stealing secret documents from 
the Axis, and rescuing an English Captain from an Austrian castle. His last mission, dated 
September 1944, entails rescuing an English Major from the “Dulag IIIA” labor camp in 
Strasshof, Austria. Unlike former representations of WWII in video games, Call of Duty here 
alludes, if only in a highly reductive version, to the Holocaust’s infrastructure within a playable 

 
172 
 
 
game space. In contrast to most other missions, this one features a 10:00 minute time limit 
triggered by the first shot fired by Martin.87  
Equipped with a sniper gun, Martin eliminates the guards by the camp entrance, clearing 
the way for Captain Foley (see boot camp level) to ram the gate with a truck. Upon entering the 
camp, Martin and his comrades shoot wave after wave of German soldiers, making their way to 
the prison, where they are greeted by stereotypically British Major Ingram: “Yanks! Now there’s 
a spot of luck! Come to collect me, have you? Lead on lads, no time for handshakes and hellos.” 
This quirky dialogue is one of several aspects illustrating that the representation of the Holocaust 
is primarily invested in “checking the box” of including Nazi crimes, rather than in a 
representation of historical events in their own right. Most importantly, it offers gameplay in a 
non-controversial space, rather than exposure to troubling historical human cruelties, which 
could lead the player to a moment of reflection which would take them out of the represented 
historical moment in which they are immersed.  
Computer Gaming World’s review from January 2004 shares this sentiment, claiming 
that “[s]ure, there’s nothing really funny about war, but Call of Duty is a game, and, well, games 
are supposed to be fun” (103). This idea that games are primarily a vehicle for fun has been 
challenged, particularly by scholars in queer game studies who find that this focus prevents the 
exploration of marginalized identities and unpleasant subject matters. Bonnie Ruberg (2015) 
claims that “[t]he traditional and often myopic focus on fun forecloses a rich array of emotions—
among them anger, annoyance, fear, alarm, and hurt—that can in fact shape a game’s message as 
much as (if not more than) its content and mechanics. By contrast, looking at games that go 
                                                
87 This hard time limit does not receive any explicit narrative motivation. All the player learns is that the Major has 
to be rescued by then, or “they’ll be sending someone to rescue us.” 

 
173 
 
 
beyond fun creates new spaces for players, games, and queer worlds at the margins” (110). 
While the above review clashes with Ruberg’s call to make video games able to create new 
spaces for formerly less represented groups, especially in the LGBTQ community, the sentiment 
perfectly illustrates the limitations of games that require a considerable financial return on their 
labor and cost intensive production upon release. Mohini Dutta (2015) illustrates this when she 
laments a “separation into games for ‘fun’ and games for ‘change’,” between “games for 
pleasure [and] games for social justice” (n.p.), and, one might add, games that ride on a 
substantial investment of funds, and those that are able to take risks. 
What can be represented is thus not only decided by technological limitations but also 
depends on assumptions about the medium’s appropriate objects of representation and the 
necessity to avoid public outrage as well as the financially crucial target audience of main-stream 
gamers ‘not having fun’. While I have argued in chapter III that the release of Saving Private 
Ryan opened up the setting of WWII to FPSs, it appears that the genre’s perception in 2003 still 
rendered its games unable to engage with controversial themes. Ironically, while later, 
exclusively “Mature” rated, installments of the franchise would regularly include controversial 
levels and marketing materials to boost their releases’ visibility (most notoriously the “No 
Russian” level in 2009’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, in which the player participates in a 
terroristic airport massacre), the original game successfully obtained a “Teen” rating by avoiding 
such dynamics. 
Focusing on a prison, rather than a concentration camp allows Call of Duty’s designers to 
historically motivate not showing the horrors of a death camp. The design of the camp itself also 
serves this purpose. While it features a recognizable visual inventory from Nazi camps (barbed 
wire, watch towers, etc.), it fails to even acknowledge the presence of any detainees besides the 

 
174 
 
 
Major. Not only is the camp void of prisoners,88 but all the buildings (save the Major’s prison) 
consist of dining halls similar to the one shown in Figure 67, featuring no sleeping barracks. 
Troublingly, while omitting references to war crimes, the level features a swimming pool in the 
camp’s center, a historical element (primarily for staff-use) frequently used by Holocaust deniers 
in attempts to downplay the cruelties occurring in Auschwitz and other camps (Potok 2010). 
In addition, the 10:00 minute time limit on top of the attacking troops forces the player to 
rush through the camp to reach the prison building in time, minimizing both exposure to the 
level’s minimal details and any time to reflect on its representational blind spots. The logical 
flaw of a heavily fortified camp with one single prisoner does put this level at odds with its own 
claims to realism, but, more interestingly, it showcases the wish to not entirely leave out Nazi 
crimes against humanity, which in (historically inaccurate) popular representations has 
frequently served as the central legitimation for American involvement in the European Theater. 
                                                
88 Thousands of Hungarian Jews had (via Auschwitz) been sent to Strasshof in June 1944, so their absence is 
historically inaccurate. 

 
175 
 
 
 
Figure 67: Dining hall in the Dulag IIIA mission 
 
At the same time, the game avoids spoiling the immersive ‘rush’ of killing Nazis—in fact, as a 
result of the timer, pacing increases—by including explicit references to the Nazis’ war crimes. 
While I do not argue that pacing directly influences realism, the inclusion of a timer serves as a 
type of filter controlling the player’s contact with the game’s level and privileges the level’s 
objective, rather than its setting. It does not influence game space itself. However, similarly to 
appropriate agency (see my discussion above), the level can produce an experience of historical 
resonance by producing a pacing appropriate for a soldier on a hectic 1940s’ rescue mission 
behind Nazi lines.  
Not unlike the inclusion of archival materials largely located outside of gameplay, the 
rushed and minimized presence of Nazi war crimes link the game to popular historiographies, 
while never fleshing out this connection. Notwithstanding any speculation on the designers’ 

 
176 
 
 
motives, it remains noteworthy that Call of Duty features this awkward representational 
compromise. While the simulation of time pressure might result in historical resonance, its main 
focus is the player’s continuously enjoyable gameplay experience and the game’s non-
controversial reception. 
 
The British Campaign – Operation Tonga 
 
Arguably the most evident design choice indicative of the desire to market Call of Duty 
to a more global audience is that the single-player campaign takes place from the perspectives of 
the American, British and Russian forces, rather than, like Medal of Honor, being restricted to a 
narrative covering U.S. efforts. In a contrast to Private Martin’s story and its strong emphasis on 
squad movements, the British campaign in large parts echoes Medal of Honor’s quasi-
superhuman soldier, ending its story with a covert spy operation. It differs from the U.S. 
protagonist, as the resulting minimal presence of meaningful NPCs and the near-absence of his 
reactions to the events render protagonist Sgt. Evans hard to identify with. This, in turn, hinders 
psychological immersion. 
The counterpart to Martin’s handwritten diary (see above) equally shows little investment 
in his character. As Figure 68 shows, the British campaign’s first loading screen not only 
removes the highly personal diary to introduce the player to Evans, but personal photos, and, in 
fact, any visual portrayal of the player-character are absent. Instead of interlocking a subjective 
and a top-down anticipation of the events to come, its focus lies on an official, “TOP SECRET,” 
typewritten document outlining the first mission in dispassionate military language. While 
handwritten annotations can be spotted both on the document and the photographs in the 

 
177 
 
 
background, Evans’ personal voice is largely absent from what serves as his introduction to the 
player. 
 
Figure 68: Evans' Orders (Loading Screen) 
The mission opens with Evans and his comrades crashing close to ‘Pegasus Bridge’ in the 
middle of the night, overwhelming German forces and claiming the bridge as their own. This 
mission is based on “Operation Deadstick,” in which British troops captured the Caen Canal 
bridge (to be renamed Pegasus Bridge afterwards) and the River Orne bridge. 
In the morning hours of June 6, 1944, the soldiers fight off Wehrmacht counterattacks, 
with Evans in charge of the German Flak gun, eliminating Wehrmacht tanks. After having 
successfully held the bridge long enough for British reinforcements to arrive (with a 5:00 minute 
timer indicating the remaining time), Evans is deployed to the German Ruhrgebiet, a primary 
technological hub for Nazi Germany. To clear the way for British bombers, he singlehandedly 

 
178 
 
 
infiltrates the Edersee Dam89 and—with the help of explosives—destroys any anti-aircraft guns 
in the vicinity, while also damaging the dam’s generators. After he is met by a Captain (“Captain 
Price”) and a fellow soldier in a truck outside of the facility, they flee heavy German attacks to 
reach an Airfield. Using an anti-aircraft gun, Evans destroys the German Stuka dive bombers 
chasing them and finally boards a friendly plane that takes him and his fellow soldiers to safety.  
This mission is loosely based on 1943’s Operation Chastise, in which British bombers 
damaged the Edersee Dam; however, not with the help of any troops securing the premises 
beforehand. In 1955, Pathé cinematically released the movie The Dam Busters based on these 
events in the UK. This way, Call of Duty chooses a narrative and setting already established via 
film. 
The last mission features Captain Price and Evans boarding the German battleship Tirpitz 
disguised as German officers. As Price dies in German gunfire when his papers are discovered to 
be counterfeit, Evans, once more with the help of explosives, destroys the ship’s boilers and 
radar systems, recovering patrol logs and order documents in the process. With Price being 
fatally hit during the beginning of the mission, Evans shoots his way through the battleship by 
himself, escaping on the boat that had brought him and Price on board. 
The game mechanics conform largely to the American campaign, allowing the game to 
forego a second boot camp style introduction, which presented the player with an effective way 
to identify with his player-character. Like his U.S. counterpart Private Martin, only Evans has 
access to weapons needed to successfully hold Pegasus Bridge and eliminate Stuka bombers, and 
he shoots German forces from the back of a driving truck during one mission. The function of 
the timer is reversed here: unlike Martin’s timed effort to break out Major Ingram, Evan must 
                                                
89 The game abbreviates its name to “Eder Dam”. 

 
179 
 
 
hold the bridge until reinforcements arrive: when the timer has run out, the mission is successful, 
rather than a failure. The mechanics of space also don’t vary meaningfully from the American 
missions. Like Martin, Evans takes and holds ground with the corresponding movement patterns. 
The British last two “lone wolf”-type missions, which barely feature any Allied NPCs, 
contain little meaningful English dialogue. As a result, unlike in the American campaign, Evans’ 
identity is rarely fleshed out by means of dialogue, displaying the game’s focus on the American 
campaign. With Voronin, the Russian campaign features a player-character even less fleshed-out 
and even more problematic as a facilitator of psychological immersion. Furthermore, the Russian 
(communist) war effort is portrayed as driven by threatening and coercing its troops into battle, 
resulting in a clear ideological difference to the portrayal of the two, allegedly self-motivated, 
capitalist countries. 
 
The Russian Campaign--From the Battle of Stalingrad to The Battle of Berlin 
The campaign does not make the player participate in the Russian war of aggression, in 
which the USSR invaded Poland from the East as allies of Nazi Germany beginning September 
1939. Rather, it opens on September 18, 1942, more than a year after Germany had attacked the 
Soviet Union, effectively ending the 1939 German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact or ‘Hitler-Stalin 
Pact.’ 
While the American campaign features a player-character motivated by comradery, and 
the British campaign relies on dutifully fulfilling orders, the Russian campaign highlights a sense 
of pressure and threat from superiors as the troops’ motivation to push forward. The American 
preloader differentiates between soldiers and “the brass,” allowing the player to identify more 
strongly with the former. In fact, one might argue that the available contrast supports the 
immersive experience of the American levels. The British document, however, does not establish 

 
180 
 
 
a relationship between the two groups. Rather, it frames the British war effort as ordered from 
the top, rather than as a patriotic effort, while the player-character’s actions confirm an embrace 
of these orders. This slight absence of soldier agency is strongly intensified in the Russian 
missions’ preloaders.  
 
Figure 69: Stalin's Order 227 (Loading Screen) 
After Martin’s diary, and Evans’ annotated mission briefing with a relatively small 
audience (indicated by its “top secret” label), Stalin’s order and the Russian propaganda posters 
constitute the broadest, least individualized access to the Russian player-character. A shortened 
version of Stalin’s historical order 227 (Figure 69), which opens the first mission as a loading 
screen, anticipates this sense of pressure. It addresses the army as a collective “we” and 

 
181 
 
 
depersonalizes the sense of pressure by downplaying its nature of a military command, and 
shifting it to the personified “Motherland,” rather than Stalin as its agent. The  
 
Figure 70: Irakli Toidze, Motherland Is 
Calling! (1941) 
 
Figure 71: Viktor Semyonovich Klimashin, 
Kill the German Beasts! (1943) 
 
threats against “panic-mongers, traitors, and cowards” resonate with the document’s generally 
brutal tone (“stubbornly,” “to the last droplet of blood,” “grab”) and form a strong contrast to the 
patriotic US soldiers, who, in Martin’s diary, were described as eager to fight. Soldier agency is 
replaced by force and the rhetorical employment of the Motherland as an ultimate authority at 
the apex of the military hierarchy. 
The order’s shortened version also draws stronger attention to the verb “exterminate,” a 
word choice that, while present in the historical document, blurs the lines between Russian war 
efforts and Nazi Germany’s genocide. The document itself is attached to a wooden surface, amid 
Russian propaganda posters: The poster on the left is a fragment of Irakli Toidze’s 1941 

 
182 
 
 
Motherland Is Calling! painting (Figure 70), depicting a woman holding the Red Army’s Oath of 
Allegiance, including a pledge to “unquestioningly carry out all military … orders of 
commanders” and to accept the “harsh punishment of Soviet law” if breaking the oath. The 
poster fragment on the right is a piece of Viktor Semyonovich Klimashin’s 1943 painting Kill the 
German Beasts! (Figure 71), which depicts a red bayonet killing a tiger identified as Nazi 
Germany by means of swastikas. The text reads: “Kill the German Beasts! Annihilate Hitler’s 
Army – You Can And You Must!” Similar to the U.S. campaign’s tutorial level that features 
variations of contemporary artwork, the two posters result in a sense of historical realism via the 
archive effect, yet, like the game’s opening cinematics, this realism is located outside immersive 
gameplay. 
 
Gameplay and Narrative 
Not surprisingly, the Russian campaign does not feature any major deviations from the 
gameplay mechanisms featured in the other campaigns. In its use of NPCs and general narrative, 
however, the campaign constitutes an explicit extension of the theme of military coercion, to 
which the first loading screen alludes. Forced at gunpoint by his superior officers, conscript 
soldier Corporal Voronin (“Воронин”), at first not carrying a weapon, joins his comrades in 
liberating Stalingrad in his first mission. As he picks up one of the guns left by the droves of 
dead Russian soldiers, he makes his way to the city, where he kills German officers with a sniper 
gun, finally capturing Red Square. Teaming up with Sgt. Makarov, the two clear several 
buildings until the player is instructed to meet up with Captain Zubov at the train station. 
Promoted to Junior Sergeant, Voronin secures a supply route in the city’s sewers before arriving 
at a “Pavlov’s house,” a German stronghold, where he meets up with a squad of comrades. Here, 
he witnesses a fellow soldier being forced to act as a decoy, attracting German fire, while the rest 

 
183 
 
 
of the group make their way forward. Holding the house until reinforcements arrive (indicated by 
a 4:00 minute timer), he finishes the mission. As he is then deployed into Poland in 1944, 
Voronin infiltrates and destroys a German tank repair facility. Commandeering a T-34 tank for 
the next two missions, he helps a group of Russian tanks to push westward through Poland, 
travelling through countryside and an unnamed Polish town in ruins.  
The theme of coercion is noticeably present throughout large parts of the campaign, 
illustrating the game’s ideology that demonizes the only non-capitalist allied nation it represents. 
The push into Stalingrad begins with a group of visibly frightened troops on a boat crossing the 
Volga river. The superiors remind the soldiers by yelling at them through a megaphone in a 
heavy Russian accent that “[t]here will be no mercy for defeatists, cowards, or traitors! Anyone 
caught deserting his post will be shot!,” recalling Stalin’s order on the mission’s loading screen. 
As terrified soldiers jump over board when German bombers launch an attack on the boat, the 
superiors first attempt to push them back (Figure 72), then shoot into the water to kill any 
surviving “traitors” (Figure 73).  
Ironically, this mission most strongly resembles Saving Private Ryan’s opening 
sequence: both feature terrified soldiers on a boat moving into an extremely chaotic and violent 
battlefield, jumping ship—on Captain Miller’s (Tom Hanks) command, rather than by deserting 
in SPR—only to be shot underwater. The two scenes also employ Czech hedgehog barricades, a 
moment during which sound cuts out to simulate shellshock, and dead comrades scattered across 
the shore (Figure 74 and Figure 75). The difference between Saving Private Ryan’s Captain 
Miller, shown as part of the crew, to the crass indifference of the Russian campaign’s soldiers 
and aggressive superiors is meaningful here, delivering a noticeable contrast between Saving 

 
184 
 
 
Private Ryan’s heroic American soldiers and the Russian soldiers brutally forced into battle by 
incorporating the film’s mise-en-scène.

186 
 
 
When taking the German stronghold “Pavlov’s house,”90 the commanding Sergeant 
similarly forces a private to serve as bait for the German troops, allowing the player to attack the 
house with a sniper rifle from a safe distance: “Private Kovalenko, as the fastest man here, you 
will be the bait.—Me? No, thank you, Comrade.—That is an order! Alexei will cover you with 
the sniper rifle from here. Now go before I shoot you myself.” Choosing to be shot by Germans, 
rather than by myself (in this way, the order acknowledges that Kovalenko will be shot either 
way), he storms toward the house, dying in the process, unless the player manages to kill the 
Germans in time, which does not make a difference to the mission’s outcome. 
The theme of forcing soldiers to move into battle, which in the first mission is stressed by 
contrast with Saving Private Ryan’s soldiers, separates the Russian campaign from those of the 
U.S. and the U.K. It allows the player to call on prior cinematic representation of WWII, while 
contributing to the game’s overall message of the U.S. soldier as exceptionally brave and moral: 
unlike the Russians, the Americans do not have to be coerced to fight. While perceptual 
immersion is supported like it is in the previous campaigns, psychological immersion rest almost 
entirely on the mode of historical realism (historical artifacts, visuals taken from popular 
cinematic representation, confirmation of the idea that Russian soldiers were less heroic than its 
capitalist allies), as Voronin is not fleshed-out enough to constitute an effective catalyst for 
psychological immersion via identification. 
The strong ideological structure of the Russian campaign does, of course, not mean that 
playing it necessarily results in a dismissal of the country’s war effort. Murray notices that the 
ability of players in some Star Wars games to play from the perspective of the villainous empire 
speaks to the fighting game genre’s dramatic potential: “[T]he moral impact of enacting an 
                                                
90 The building and its name are also based on a historical German stronghold. 

 
187 
 
 
opposing role is a promising sign of the serious dramatic potential of the fighting game” (139). 
While Call of Duty never has Russia and USA ahistorically face each other in combat, their 
soldiers’ different motivations compare the systems of capitalism and communism, alleging 
different levels of freedom, self-motivation, and coercion, for their citizens. As a result, playing 
as a Russian soldier indeed has the player enact an ideologically (if not militarily) opposition to 
the United States. In spite of its rigid ideology, the game thus allows for a richer experience, 
especially as the Russian gameplay itself remains virtually indistinguishable from the other 
campaigns. This could open up reflections on the constant brutal nature of war, independent from 
its ideological backgrounds, and yield an understanding of the similar nature of all soldiers’ 
combat experiences at the time. This, however, requires a certain level of abstraction, or at the 
least a type of play that focuses on the played battles, rather than their ideological narratives. 
 
The “Allied Campaign” 
In an effort to tie the three former campaigns together, the concluding “Allied Campaign” 
features three missions: a U.S. mission played through the player-character Martin, a UK mission 
played through Evans, and a Russian mission played through Voronin. Differences in gameplay 
and narrative to the other campaigns are once more virtually absent, as every mission conforms 
to the frameworks I laid out earlier. Martin is tasked to capture documents that contain the 
location of V2 rockets about to be fired at London, which Evans then destroys in mission 2. 
Finally, Voronin participates in the Battle of Berlin, ending with witnessing the Russian flag 
being flown on top of the Reichstag.  
Ending the game from a Russian perspective (with the opening cry “Victory or death!”, 
reinforcing the theme of coercion) appears to be at odds with the game’s general focus on U.S. 
troops as being heroic. However, as the Battle of Berlin effectively constitutes the end of the war 

 
188 
 
 
in the European theater, this ending is an understandable design choice. The cinematic end 
sequence of the game, however, explicitly ties the three campaigns together for the first time in 
the game. 
Given that either mission could have easily been incorporated into the three major 
campaigns, this awkward coda cannot be motivated narratively. Rather, it allows to echo the 
game’s motif of pan-national efforts that served Call of Duty’s claims to historical realism on its 
game box art and cinematic opening by switching between its points of view more quickly. It is 
the concluding cinematic sequence, which effectively ties the American and the Russian war 
effort together for the first time, however, similarly to the opening sequence, outside of 
gameplay. The cinematic ending consists of archival footage showing celebrating freed civilians, 
German POWs and celebrating allied soldiers, taking the player out of immersive gameplay and 
offering the perspective of an outside observer, “a contemporary viewer watching cable 
television and learning about events far in the past” (Allison, 89). A voiceover in a Russian 
accent narrates the images, concluding “Today, I crossed the Elbe river in Germany and shook 
hands with an American soldier. Although I could not understand anything he said, I felt this 
man was my brother. And I think he felt the same.” This sequence explicitly ties the three 
campaigns together, as contact between the three nations happened only once throughout the 
game (the British Major’s prison-break facilitated by American troops). 
 
Conclusion 
Organized by means of a pan-national narrative, Call of Duty’s four campaigns do little 
to hide the game’s hierarchy in its portrayals of U.S.-American, British and Russian soldiers. 
While immersion via perceptual identification and via the mode of historical realism remain 
largely constant within the game’s three national perspectives, the three player-characters 

 
189 
 
 
Martin, Evans and Voronin, as well as their interactions with NPCs reveal an ideology that 
conforms to popular U.S.-centric accounts of WWII generally, and to an ideological difference 
between capitalism and communism specifically. Yet, conforming to those accounts once more 
supports the mode of historical realism by confirming the player’s assumptions about these 
nations. 
 Additional features of this mode include historical artifacts, including a quasi-fetishistic 
recreation of WWII weaponry, and narrative/visual tropes taken from cinematic representations 
of battle. Bookmarking gameplay with cinematic sequences that evoke the position of a viewer 
watching a cable-TV history special (Allison) serves the same purpose by using visuals created 
by the game’s engine, while simultaneously using the archive effect to reference the materiality 
of historical documents. 
The game’s unsuccessful attempt at representing the Holocaust, however, reveals that this 
mode and immersion are not necessarily connected to each other, and that historical realism can 
be subject to conflicts with game design and commercial interests. As I will show in this 
dissertation’s conclusion, Call of Duty represents a third iteration in the evolution of the WWII 
FPS, constituting the point of wedding immersion with historical realism after Wolfenstein 3D’s 
anti-historical, and Medal of Honor’s genre-driven scenarios, while 2009’s Wolfenstein remake 
marks the end of historical WWII representation as a thematic center for FPSs.

CONCLUSION 
 
I began this project invested in the wish that the public discourse take video games more 
seriously than it historically has, an impulse which I share with many of my colleagues in game 
studies. The representations of history featured in Medal of Honor and Call of Duty do not 
always possess the complexity of media that financially depend less on pleasing their customers 
(e.g. low-budget experimental film and indie games). Yet, the ways in which the games’ 
hegemonic ideologies are embedded in their formal, narrative and affective structures are far 
more complex than their views on history and citizenship. As the games’ subject positions 
oscillate between immersing their players into artificial historical spaces and the affectively 
removed subject position of Bertolt Brecht’s Epic theater, they deserve to be analyzed as 
meaningful components of a widespread mode of engaging with historical representation. This 
dissertation has focused on the ways the cultural environment of 1990s and early 2000s U.S. has 
shaped particular representations of events central to this country’s ideology, and the reactions 
provoked by these representations. A focus on different historical and cultural settings would 
yield different, yet equally useful observations on the interplay of culture and representation. 
 
In Germany, a political discourse that has not taken video games as seriously as the U.S. 
has created a paradoxical situation in which media censorship aims to protect citizens from what 
is thought of as the anti-democratic power of Nazi symbolism. Media violence is heavily policed, 
and the representation of the swastika is limited to “educational purposes, the struggle against 
unconstitutional movements, art, science, research or teaching, reporting on current events or 
history and similar purposes” (§86 1.3 StGB). Video games have not enjoyed the cultural capital 
of narrative film and literature. As a result, Germany’s treatment of shooter games that represent 
World War II differs from any other nation’s game localization efforts: suspicions about virtual

violence and assumptions about its immersive nature led to heavily modified German releases of 
Medal of Honor and Call of Duty. The former title entered the German market in a censored 
version, which was not allowed to be advertised or openly displayed in stores and was restricted 
to customers over 18 years of age. Call of Duty met with a similar fate. Its representations of the 
swastika were exchanged for images of the iron cross or altogether removed, while words like 
“Nazi” or “fascist” were substituted with “Deutscher” (German man) and the Wehrmacht was 
renamed “deutsche Armee” (German army). Like Medal of Honor, it was only available to adults 
and could not be advertised. This particular protocol of limiting media access was to a great part 
established for pornography and horror, where it has been frequently used to censor, ban and 
limit access to film. Legally grouping shooter games with these genres again exemplifies Linda 
Williams’ observations on cultural capital and Body Genres (see Introduction). 
Legally repressing these games, which center around killing Nazis, has led to a strange 
interest from Neo-Nazis. These right-wing groups consider gaining illegal access to these banned 
symbols an act of rebellion, a rebellion that overrides the games’ intended ideology of 
celebrating violence against Nazis. In 1998, a Frankfurt court found a member of what the judges 
called the “nationalist scene,”91 guilty of publicly displaying unconstitutional symbols.92 He had 
uploaded Wolfenstein 3D (1992, see Chapter I)— a game in which the player’s enemies and their 
environments are covered with swastikas— to his mailbox and shared his password with a group 
of 120-130 fellow ‘nationalists’. The judges argued that allowing the application of such symbols 
in video games would make it impossible to counteract their growing public use. If children and 
teenagers were legally permitted to be exposed to such symbols of unconstitutional organizations 
                                                
91 As a result, the court strangely adopted the euphemistic self-description of German Neo-Nazis

in video games, they could easily become accustomed to them, which in turn could make them 
more susceptible to being influenced by National Socialist ideology. According to this panel of 
judges, the fact that the Nazi symbols in Wolfenstein 3D are those of the player character’s foes 
does not solve this problem, as one would always have to anticipate that some players of video 
games or any forms of play would sympathize or identify with the opponent or enemy in the 
game. The historical and legal environment of Germany thus led to a reversal in the game’s 
American reception: it rebranded playing this fictionalized celebration of America’s anti-Nazi 
efforts as an act of right-wing civil disobedience. While there are scholarly engagements with 
German game censorship (Mayer 2012), an analysis of the fluid construction of ideology in 
immersive video games via a complex interplay between immersion, historical heritage, political 
anxieties and the representation of traumatic history remains to be explored in the German 
context. 
 
In this dissertation, I have shown that the ways in which users access the content of 
commercial historical representations are informed by the cultural discourse into which these 
representations are released. While I have also shown how the cultural environment— such as 
the discourse on the “Greatest Generation”— can steer decisions on the part of game design, it is 
equally true that cultural and historical circumstances —like the aftermath of the 1999 
Columbine High School massacre— necessarily inform a game’s reception, including the 
experience of playing it. Of course, while the catalyst for my own project had been a frustration 
with a dismissive treatment of a highly influential medium by German media censors, I wrote 
much of it in a political climate suggesting that notions of realism and the meaning of history are 
heavily shifting under a current resurgence of the political right in the United States. As of today, 
the symbolic inventory of Nazi Germany is widely seen at White Nationalist rallies that protest 

 
193 
 
 
an inclusive treatment of minorities and what they regard as the removal of Confederate heritage. 
Conspiracy theories, rather than narratives of history and culture from formerly accepted 
authorities, inform many decisions of Washington lawmakers. Faith in the media has been 
systematically reduced by the notion of ‘fake news’, while lies have been redeemed as 
“alternative facts” by White House spokesperson Kellyanne Conway. In a time in which 
presidential advisor Rudi Giuliani can proclaim that “truth isn’t truth,” but rather always 
“somebody’s version of the truth,” it is of great importance to critically analyze the multitude of 
sources from which we construct our own understanding of reality as a society. As game and 
media scholars, we can uncover the myriad ways in which immersive media tell their own stories 
about history, politics, and the place of the individual subject. Our training allows us to draw 
attention to the ways realities become articulated through media, and to share our insights with 
our students.
