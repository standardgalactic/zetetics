Abstract 
What predicts individual differences in children’s acquisition 
of consonant production across languages? Considerations of 
children’s development of early speech production have 
traditionally emphasized inherent physiological constraints of 
the vocal apparatus that speakers generally have in common 
(i.e., articulatory complexity). In contrast, we propose a 
statistical learning account of phonological development, in 
which phonological regularities of the ambient language guide 
children’s learning of those regularities in production. Across 
four languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean), we 
utilized recent meta-analytic dataset of age of consonant 
acquisition spanning 28 studies. High-density measures of 
children's ambient language environment from over 8,000 
transcripts of speech directed to over 1,000 children were used 
to assess how well the frequency of consonants in child-
directed speech predict the age of consonant acquisition. Our 
results suggest that both frequency and articulatory complexity 
are related to age of acquisition, with similar results found for 
English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean. Consonants heard 
frequently by children tended to be incorporated into their 
production repertoires earlier and consonants heard less 
frequently are incorporated into production repertoires later in 
development. We discuss future directions that incorporate a 
statistical learning pathway towards learning to produce the 
sound patterns of the ambient language.

Introduction 
How do children learn to produce the consonant sounds of 
their ambient language? Traditional approaches have focused 
on the difficulty with which consonants are produced by 
speakers (Jakobson, 1941). This difficulty has been 
conceptualized as the articulatory complexity involved with 
producing a given consonant (Kent, 1992). A recent meta-
analysis of children's consonant acquisition trajectories 
across 27 languages suggests that while some stability in 
consonant acquisition over development exists, there is also 
wide variation in consonant acquisition trajectories across 
and within languages, suggesting that consonant acquisition 
is not exclusively about articulatory complexity (McLeod & 
Crowe, 2018). For example, the consonant /f/ (as in fork) is 
relatively stable across and within languages (i.e., is 
characterized by low variance in its age of acquisition across 
languages), but the learning of /v/ (as in vase) appears to be 
guided more so by the extent to which children perceive its 
use in the ambient language (Crowe & McLeod, 2020; 
McLeod & Crowe, 2018). 
Another source of variation in children’s consonant 
acquisition may derive from the distribution of different 
consonants in the ambient language. Statistical learning— 
sensitivity to distributional patterns in the speech 
environment—has been a productive alternative research 
program to universalist claims of language acquisition (Frost, 
Armstrong, & Christiansen, 2019). Several lines of evidence 
suggest that infant vocal learning, including learning to 
produce consonant sounds, requires perceptual mechanisms 
to incorporate patterns of the ambient language into more 
mature vocalizations (Boysson-Bardies et al., 1991; Edwards 
et al., 2015; Edwards & Beckman, 2008; Goldstein & 
Schwade, 2008; Ingram, 1988). For example, compared to 
German-learning infants, Nso-learning infants produce 
significantly more click-like consonant sounds, a consonant 
pattern found mainly in the learning environment of Nso-
learning infants (Wermke et al., 2013). 
There are at least three reasons underlying the limited 
progress on fully understanding ambient language effects on 
consonant production learning in children. First, substantial 
quantifiable data on children's language environment has 
only recently become widely available to researchers 
(MacWhinney, 2000; Sanchez et al., 2019). Past consonant 
acquisition research was not able gain insights into the 
perceptual regularities present in child-directed speech, the 
sounds that children are most likely to encounter in their 
everyday learning environments. Additionally, access to 
high-density cross-linguistic data on children's consonant 
acquisition trajectories has only recently become possible 
(McLeod & Crowe, 2018). 
Second, previous models of articulatory complexity (AC) 
are themselves based on age of acquisition data (Kent, 1992). 
For example, Kent (1992) based his analysis of articulatory 
complexity on previous documentation of age of acquisition 
of consonants found by Sander (1972) and Dinnsen et al. 
(1990). AC classifications were inferred from the observed 
order in which English-learning infants and children learned 
to produce consonants. Historically, the directionality of this 
inference has been overlooked (i.e., age of consonant 
acquisition → articulatory complexity), and findings have 
been interpreted with the assumption that articulatory 
complexity explains acquisition trajectories (e.g., late

acquired consonants must be more complex). These 
misleading interpretations underestimate the role of the 
ambient language and children’s statistical learning 
capacities in consonant acquisition. Ambient language 
environments afford several regularities including variation 
in consonant functional load (i.e., the extent to which a 
consonant contrast distinguishes between words), and 
perceptual salience (Stokes & Surendran, 2005). 
Third, theoretical advances in the statistical learning 
approach to language acquisition have rarely been applied to 
the understanding of how children learn to produce the 
sounds of their ambient language. There is variation in age of 
consonant acquisition in children’s production across 
languages (McLeod & Crowe, 2018). To better understand 
where this variation comes from, we predicted differences in 
age of consonant acquisition, across languages, based on 
ambient consonant frequency regularities present in the 
learning environment. 
In the present study, we inspected individual consonants 
for their variation in age of acquisition across four languages: 
English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean . We investigated the 
word-initial frequencies of mothers’ and fathers’ speech 
found in the CHILDES database for each language 
(MacWhinney, 2000). Word-initial frequencies were used 
because children are generally known to allocate attention to 
the onsets of words (Stokes & Surendran, 2005; Vihman et 
al., 2004). Under the statistical learning hypothesis, the 
consonants children encounter frequently in perception 
should predict age of consonant acquisition across languages. 
Here, we use a semi-naturalistic measure of the ambient 
speech 
sounds 
children 
encounter 
during 
language 
acquisition. Under the articulatory complexity hypothesis, 
articulatory complexity categories based on Kent (1992) 
should predict age of consonant acquisition across languages. 
Methods 
Corpora 
Semi-naturalistic child-directed speech corpora were used to 
calculate the word-initial consonant frequencies for English, 
Spanish, Japanese, and Korean available on the CHILDES 
database (MacWhinney, 2000). These languages are the 
central focus of this work because their age of consonant 
acquisition data is drawn from 4 or more studies in the meta-
analysis of McLeod and Crowe (2018). Child-directed speech 
to children aged 72 months maximum from the target child's 
mother or father was included. Only speech categorized as 
monolingual in CHILDES was used. We used the childesr 
package in R to extract CHILDES transcripts (Sanchez et al., 
2019). 
To obtain consonant frequency counts, we used eSpeak NG 
(Dunn, 2022) for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of 
English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean  CHILDES

interactions. English: Bernstein, Bohannon, Fletcher, Gelman,

transcripts, resulting in IPA transcriptions of all lexical types 
in each corpus (Dunn, 2022). For English, we used the US 
English setting, and for Spanish, we used the Latin American 
Spanish setting as a majority and all of the studies 
respectively reported them as the dialect of their subjects. 
From these, we took only the consonant-initial words and 
extracted the onset of the word, including consonant clusters. 
The frequency of each consonant in each corpus is computed 
by summing the token count of each lexical type where the 
consonant appears in the onset either as a singleton or within 
a cluster. To compare the various corpora obtained from 
CHILDES, we computed the frequency per million tokens for 
each consonant within each cluster. Moreover, due to the 
known skewed of frequency measures, we transformed this 
measure by taking its natural logarithm. Statistical models for 
each language use the mean of this log-transformed 
frequency per million averaging across all corpora for that 
language (F). 
Because our hypothesis concerns naturalistic speech input, 
we excluded all corpora that document scripted and lab-based 
interactions1. Moreover, we also excluded bilingual corpora 
(Spanish: “SerraSole”). Finally, we excluded corpora with 
fewer than 1,000 tokens (English: “Fletcher” [86 tokens] 
“McMillan” [450 tokens], Spanish: “Marrero” [312 tokens], 
Japanese: “Ota” [13 tokens]). The data that met our inclusion 
criteria amounted to 60 corpora containing 8,517 unique 
transcripts of child-directed speech to 1,289 children with 
registered identification numbers. The final count for each 
language is 41 corpora with 5,775 transcripts and 914 
children for English; 8 corpora with 669 transcripts and 170 
children for Spanish; 7 corpora with 714 transcripts and 118 
children for Japanese; and 3 corpora with 193 transcripts and 
32 children for Korean. From eSpeak-NG’s transcription 
resulted a total of 122,417 IPA word types (English: 33,548; 
Spanish: 11,788; Japanese: 34,781; Korean: 42,300) and 
12,644,104 IPA word tokens (English: 10,560,571; Spanish: 
479,928; Japanese: 1,256,722; Korean: 346,883). 
Consonant acquisition data 
To determine the age of consonant acquisition (AoCA) per 
consonant across languages, we used the meta-analytically 
determined mean ages (in months) of acquisition reported in 
McLeod and Crowe (2018). Statistical models use the within-
study min-max normalized age (A). AoCA was the minimum 
age at which either 75% or 90% (depending on the study) of 
the participants in a given study produced a consonant 
correctly. In the case a given study had data for both criteria, 
we kept the one with the highest criterion. English AoCA data 
was derived from 15 different studies, Japanese from 5 
studies, Korean from 4 studies, and Spanish from 4 studies. 
From all the consonants included in McLeod and Crowe 
(2018), we analyzed only those that have at least 1 
appearance in the onset in all of the CHILDES corpora for 
3291

 
their respective language. For Spanish, we omitted some of 
the consonants reported in only 1 study that tested different 
individual realizations of some of the canonical consonants 
(/ŋ/, /β/, /ð/, /ʒ/, /ʤ/, /ŋ/, /ð/, /ʒ/, /ʤ/). The result of this 
filtering is 21 consonants for English, 17 for Spanish, 20 for 
Japanese, and 18 for Korean. 
Articulatory complexity 
The AC of each consonant in our study was taken from Kent 
(1992), who categorized the consonant inventory of English 
into 4 categories of increasing difficulty (C). Extensions 
beyond English, not included in Kent (1992), were taken 
from various other sources that have classified consonants 
using the same categories: Stokes and Surendran (2005), 
Cychosz (2017) and Paul (2010) for Spanish and Japanese 
consonants, and Kang (2021) for Korean consonants. 
Conflicts between these sources were resolved by authors SM 
and KC. Table 1 shows the categorization of the complete 
consonant inventory of the study.

Analytic approach 
We employed linear models implemented in R (R Core Team, 
2022) to predict age of consonant acquisition from ambient 
consonant frequency and articulatory complexity. The 
dependent variable for the models was the age of acquisition 
reported for each consonant in each of the studies for a 
language. The independent variables are the natural 
logarithm of the frequency per million tokens averaged 
across corpora for each consonant (F), and the articulatory 
complexity ranks described above (AC). 
Even though the dependent variable is a proportion bound 
by 0 and 1, it does not follow a binomial distribution. Thus, 
we followed the approach recommended in Warton and Hui 
(2011), transformed the normalized age using a logit 
function, and modeled it with a linear regression. The 
regressions were built using the lm function in R. Because the 
observations within each study are not independent, we tested 
our coefficients using the HC1 cluster-robust standard errors 
implemented in the package sandwich (Zeileis, 2004; Zeileis 
& Graham, 2020). Hypothesis testing of our coefficients was 
computed using the coeftest function of lmtest (Zeileis & 
Hothorn, 2002). 
Considering that the value of 0 is not meaningful for either 
of our independent variables, the models were fit on Z-scores. 
Overall R2 values for the models were obtained using the rsq 
package, (Zhang, 2022). 
To test the effects of both ambient frequency and 
articulatory complexity, we fitted three models for each 
language: one model including only frequency, one including 
only complexity, and one including both. We did not have a 
set prediction for the interaction between both variables, so 
we did not include an interaction term. 
Results 
Table 2 highlights the relationship between our variables. For 
all four languages, consonants with higher frequency tend to 
have a lower age of acquisition than those with lower 
frequency (Figure 1). The linear models show that both 
frequency and AC are related to age of acquisition. Table 2 
contains the coefficients and overall R2 for these effects. All 
models 
including 
single 
variables 
have 
significant 
coefficients for F and C that go in the predicted direction: 
negative F coefficients and positive C coefficients.  
The models containing both predictors for Spanish, 
Japanese, and Korean provide conflicting evidence about 
whether F and C explain different sources of variance. 
Although the R2 for the combined model is slightly higher in 
all three cases, the difference is very small. However, for 
Spanish, Japanese and Korean, the individual coefficients of 
the effects go in the predicted direction. Moreover, the 
contribution of F over C is significant in the first two, and 
close to significance (t = -1.66) in Korean (which is the 
language with the fewest studies and consonants).

The case of English is more complicated due to Kent’s 
(1992) goal when positing the articulation categories: 
explaining their age of acquisition (see the Introduction and 
the Discussion). Thus, there is little variance for the 
frequency of a consonant to explain once Kent’s categories 
of articulatory complexity have been included in the model. 
This issue makes an interpretation of the coefficient of F 
difficult and its significance possibly artifactual. 
Discussion 
Our measures take advantage of the largest data sets available 
for both consonant learning trajectories and regularities of 
children’s linguistic environment. For all the languages under 
study, the frequency with which a consonant is present in 
children’s language environment is significantly related to 
the age children acquire that consonant and it explains a 
considerable amount of variance. This relation is in the 
expected direction for all four languages considered.  
Importantly, these two variables have a considerably 
different origin and level of sophistication. On the one hand, 
articulatory complexity is notoriously difficult to measure, 
and is typically an expert-crafted variable. In Kent (1992), 
articulatory complexity categories were originally derived 
from English age of acquisition data itself, and supported by 
high-level descriptions of the movements of the articulators 
necessary for adult-like proficiency with a specific 
consonant. In contrast, our consonant frequency measure is a 
basic, low-level statistic of the language environment that 
was computed  bottom-up from a large amount of readily 
available data. Thus, considering its simplicity, we consider 
these results to be evidence of the strong promise of studying 
the effects of environmental statistics on phonological 
acquisition. Moreover, our results are completely consistent 
with the core of statistical learning: language acquisition, in 
this case consonant learning, is a product of both biological 
constraints and the detectable probabilistic patterns of the 
environment. 
 The origin of the articulatory complexity categories is a 
noteworthy limitation of our study. Kent explicitly 
acknowledges that the categories he designed for English are 
based on age of acquisition2. Although this is, of course, a 
reasonable strategy, it does mean that, in our analyses of 
English, articulatory complexity acts as a post-hoc construct 
that leaves no variance for ambient consonant frequency to 
explain. And, although these categories have been used in 
other studies of ambient frequency effects on consonant 
acquisition (Stokes & Surendran, 2005; Cychosz, 2017), it is 
difficult to interpret how AC and frequency might interact 
during the process of consonant acquisition for English. 
Moreover, this measure of AC introduces an important 
confound when included in the other languages: it is hard to 
parse out whether its explained variance comes from 
genuinely capturing a cross-linguistically relevant measure of 
 
2 According to Kent, the complexity categories are an 
interpretation of the “motoric adjustments” that underly “four 
developmental sets of sounds” (Kent, 1992, p. 74). 
articulatory difficulty, or the similarities between the 
statistics of each language and English. Therefore, a more 
data-driven measure of the difficulty of each consonant is 
needed to really assess the hypotheses. 
 One promising measure of AC in the future comes in the 
form of tongue movement ultrasound, which captures low-
level motor data on the ballistic movements of the articulators 
during real-time consonant production (Kabakoff et al., 
2022). By obtaining tongue ultrasound measures of children's 
consonant articulation, future studies can utilize measures of 
articulatory complexity. Computational approaches are also 
possible through simulating the muscle movements required 
to produce different sounds (see Blasi et al., 2019). However, 
both of these approaches are largely at a programmatic stage, 
and measures of the consonants we used, especially other 
than English, are not readily available. 
Another limitation of the study is that we focused on group-
level data, which does not allow for predicting individual 
differences in consonant trajectories. Future studies based on 
our results could design investigations to better understand 
the underlying processes which give rise to variation in how 
individual children learn to produce the speech sounds of 
their ambient language.  
The promise shown in this study by measuring cross-
linguistic consonant patterns in children’s language 
environment suggests a productive research program to 
further unpack regularities that are likely to guide how 
children learn to talk. The statistical learning perspective on 
language acquisition makes the prediction that children are 
sensitive to low- and high-level regularities and detectable 
patterns in the input which influence how learning proceeds 
(Saffran, 2020). This process is constrained by biological and 
cognitive factors. To continue exploring the potential effects 
of low-level ambient consonant features on consonant 
learning, future studies can investigate consonant frequencies 
beyond the word-initial position and consider, for example, 
word-level stress patterns. Moreover, other high-level 
probabilistic features of consonants, such as their functional 
load (i.e., the extent to which consonant contrasts distinguish 
words in a given lexicon; Stokes & Surendran, 2005) and 
perceptual salience can be investigated as complements to 
more basic frequency patterns. Finally, future work will 
assess differences in the extent to which consonants are 
experienced within a socially interactive contexts, scenarios 
which are known to modulate children's attention and vocal 
learning (Elmlinger et al., 2023; Goldstein & Schwade, 
2008). 
More generally, this study fits within a broader field effort 
to evaluate hypotheses about language development from a 
more cross-linguistically and ecologically valid perspective 
(Christiansen et al., 2022; Kidd & Garcia, 2022). Although 
the mere existence of cross-linguistic variation in the 
itinerary of consonant acquisition is not an absolute proof 
against a hypothesis based purely on articulatory complexity, 
3294

 
comparative research is able provide more detailed insights 
on the specific mechanisms that drive acquisition processes 
(Christiansen et al., 2022). The evidence presented is a first 
approximation at such a study, assessing the influence of 
different environmental and biological features on consonant 
acquisition in a cross-linguistic comparative context. 
However, the languages used in the study vary in too many 
dimensions and are too few, weakening the conclusions that 
can be drawn from it. Therefore, and most importantly, future 
work will examine a broader sample of languages and 
consider fine-grained, controlled comparisons between 
closely related languages to better pry apart and understand 
the interweaving influence of environmental and biological 
constraints on consonant acquisition.
