Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the measurement structure 
of the linguistic features of speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs) talk during 
business-as-usual therapy sessions in the public schools and to test the longi-
tudinal stability of a theorized dimensional structure consisting of quantity, 
grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity. 
Method: Seventy-five SLPs’ talk during therapy sessions with primary-grade stu-
dents was automatically transcribed and coded for linguistic features from a cor-
pus of 579 videotaped therapy session videos collected at the beginning, middle, 
and end of one school year with an approximately 12-week interval. We explored 
video characteristics and conducted descriptive statistics on eight linguistic indi-
ces of SLP talk to examine the variability in SLP talk between therapy sessions. 
Confirmatory factor analyses were used to explore the dimensional structure of 
SLP talk at each time point separately for the theorized three dimensions, and we 
conducted longitudinal measurement invariance analyses to test the stability of 
the three-factor structural model across the academic year. 
Results: There were considerable variabilities among SLPs in the characteristics 
of SLP talk during therapy sessions. The proposed three-factor structure of SLP 
talk consisting of quantity, grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity had 
good model fit at all three time points. The linguistic measurement properties 
representing the three factors were invariant over time. 
Conclusions: Results provided robust evidence of between-SLP variability in 
their child-directed talk, established a three-dimensional structure of the lin-
guistic features in SLP talk, and identified that the linguistic features in SLP 
talk stably measured the same constructs across one school year, based on 
measurement invariance. The dimensions of SLP talk during therapy with stu-
dents may represent important, malleable features of therapy that influence 
child language gains. 
There is ongoing interest in understanding the spe-
cific features of speech-language therapy that influence the 
language development of children with developmental dis-
orders of language (Turkstra et al., 2016). Researchers are 
especially attuned to the importance of child-directed talk 
by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and other care-
givers, such as parents, which represents talk directly spo-
ken to a child rather than ambient talk in the near envi-
ronment (Golinkoff et al., 2019). While there is consider-
able evidence delineating the precise aspects of parents’ 
child-directed 
talk 
that 
influences 
children’s 
language 
growth over time (e.g., Hoff, 2003; Huttenlocher et al.,

2002), far less is known about the role of SLPs’ child-
directed talk as a potential contributor to children’s lan-
guage development. A key rationale for improving our 
understanding of SLPs’ child-directed talk is that SLP talk 
is a malleable feature of therapy and thus may be manipu-
lated to enhance the efficacy of therapy for children. 
To advance this area of research, the purpose of the 
current study was to examine variability among SLPs in 
their child-directed talk during business-as-usual (BAU) 
school-based therapy sessions with children with language 
disorders, to explore the dimensional structure of SLP’s 
child-directed talk, and to test the stability of the dimen-
sional structure across one school year. Establishing a psy-
chometrically equivalent and longitudinally viable struc-
ture of SLPs’ child-directed talk sets the stage for future 
longitudinal analyses on the changes of underlying con-
structs in SLP talk and its potential contributions to chil-
dren’s language growth over time. The present work is 
viewed as foundational to future work designed to lever-
age the characteristics of SLP talk as a key aspect of ther-
apy for children. 
The Role of Child-Directed Talk in 
Language Learning 
The importance of language skills within the aca-
demic milieu is well established, as language ability serves 
as the basis for higher order cognitive skills such as read-
ing and math, as well as social skills such as self-control 
and executive 
functioning 
(Cocking 
& Mestre, 
1988; 
Matte-Gagne & Bernier, 2011; Pace et al., 2019; Roben 
et al., 2013). Consequently, for children who are develop-
ing typically as well as those with developmental language 
disorder (DLD), there is considerable interest in identify-
ing instructional targets and pedagogical strategies for 
enhancing language growth in the early primary grades. 
For example, the Common Core State Standards (Language 
Standards, K–5) specify the importance of teachers’ sup-
port of primary-grade students in the development of lan-
guage skills across three areas: conventions of Standard 
English (e.g., form and use of simple verb tenses), knowl-
edge of language, and vocabulary (National Governors 
Association, 2010). For children with DLD, attainment of 
grade- or age-level skills in these areas may lag relative to 
their typically developing peers (Blackwell et al., 2015; 
Schmitt, Logan, et al., 2017), thus warranting specialized 
interventions to help them acquire these skills and succeed 
within the general education environment. 
According to Vygotsky’s (1978) social learning the-
ory, learning occurs through positive interactions with 
teachers and peers that provide opportunities and moti-
vations to engage in learning activities. Among many 
factors contributing to children’s language learning and 
development, language directed to children is viewed as 
the most crucial factor in language acquisition (Golinkoff 
et al., 2019), referred to as child-directed talk. As argued 
by Golinkoff et al. (2019), words passing through children’s 
ears are not sufficient for language development, because 
language growth requires meaningful back-and-forth con-
versations directed to children that can be facilitated by 
child-directed talk. To this point, child-directed talk exerts 
a greater impact on language growth than overheard talk 
(e.g., Shneidman & Goldin-Meadow, 2012). In a longitudi-
nal study of 30 Chicago children and their families, only 
child-directed speech, not overheard speech, at 30 months 
contributed 
to 
children’s 
vocabulary 
development 
at 
42 months (Shneidman et al., 2013). In part, this reflects 
evidence showing that language learning is best facilitated 
when linguistic input is rooted in shared attention, builds 
on what children are doing at the moment, and models 
syntax through recasting and expanding utterances (Harris 
et al., 2010; Malin et al., 2014; McGillion et al., 2017). 
Indeed, ample studies have demonstrated that back-and-
forth conversations that build upon children’s contributions 
are necessary to prime language learning (e.g., Reed et al., 
2017; Romeo et al., 2018). 
For children with DLD, research suggests that opti-
mizing child-directed parental talk has positive effects on 
language learning in these children, based on studies in 
the 
home 
environment 
(e.g., 
Cologon 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Kruythoff-Broekman et al., 2019). Within the educa-
tional 
milieu, 
including 
preschool 
and 
the 
primary 
grades, efforts have long been directed at identifying 
means to enhance educators’ talk with children with 
DLD, including their child-directed talk. For instance, 
Justice et al.  tested  the effects of the language-focused 
curriculum (Bunce, 1995) as implemented by preschool 
teachers with children from low-income homes (Justice 
et al., 2008). Originally developed for use in inclusive 
settings for children with DLD, the language-focused 
curriculum 
trains 
teachers 
to 
use 
enhanced 
child-
directed talk to facilitate children’s growth in vocabu-
lary, grammar, and social pragmatics through enriched 
dramatic play routines. Specifically, teachers learn to 
use modeling, elicitation, and recasts in their child-
directed talk as a means to enhance back-and-forth con-
versations with children during play. In a separate study 
involving primary-grade students in two classrooms, 
SLPs and teachers implemented a language-rich curricu-
lum supplement with intentional teaching of narrative 
and vocabulary skills (Gillam et al., 2014). With respect 
to the vocabulary component, in three weekly in-class 
sessions, SLPs explicitly highlighted and defined aca-
demic vocabulary words in storybook discussions. Spe-
cific aspects of child-directed talk used by the SLPs to 
facilitate back-and-forth discussions of academic words

included modeling, feedback, and recasts, similar to the 
strategies employed by teachers in the language-focused 
curriculum. 
Dimensionality and Variability of 
Child-Directed Talk 
Child-directed talk is often investigated as a multidi-
mensional construct, comprising minimally the domains of 
quantity and complexity (e.g., Gámez & Lesaux, 2012; 
Hollo et al., 2020). Quantity typically refers to the sheer 
volume of talk to which children are exposed in terms of 
number of words, number of utterances, number of 
clauses, among others, and research findings suggest that 
the sheer amount of talk to which children are exposed 
matters (Huttenlocher et al., 1991). For instance, there is 
a strong association between the quantity of child-directed 
talk and children’s language growth and cognitive devel-
opment (Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Levine et al., 2010; 
Rowe, 2012). Complexity of talk typically refers to vari-
ability in lexical (e.g., number of unique words) and syn-
tactic forms (e.g., proportion of complex utterances) to 
which children are exposed. Exposure to more lexically 
and syntactically complex talk is associated with acceler-
ated language growth among young children (Hoff, 2003; 
Huttenlocher et al., 2002; Rowe, 2008), and grammatically 
complex talk is an important mechanism for facilitating 
more talk from children (Proctor-Williams & Fey, 2007). 
Both the quantity and quality of language input exert 
influence on children’s language skill (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 
2015; Hoff, 2013). In a study investigating the underlying 
mechanism by which socioeconomic status (SES) affects 
children’s language development, Hoff (2003) found that 
child-directed maternal speech, measured by both quantity 
(such as total number of utterances and words) and com-
plexity (such as number of word types), fully mediated the 
association between family SES and children’s vocabulary 
growth. 
Examining the dimensionality of SLP talk from the 
perspectives of quantity and grammatical and lexical com-
plexity is important for several reasons. First, the quantity 
of SLP talk is essential to understanding the balance of 
verbal input between the SLPs and the children with DLD 
during therapy sessions and how different proportions of 
verbal input may impact children’s engagement, responses, 
and learning outcomes (Girolametto et al., 2003; Pennington 
& McConachie, 2001). Second, analyzing the grammatical 
complexity of SLP talk provides insight into the linguistic 
scaffolding techniques that SLPs may employ during ther-
apy sessions (Proctor-Williams et al., 2001). A better 
understanding of the relationship between grammatical 
complexity and children’s language development may 
inform and refine therapy approaches that facilitate 
language 
growth 
(Cirrin 
& 
Gillam, 
2008). 
Finally, 
examining the lexical complexity of SLP talk may reveal 
the extent to which SLPs adapt their vocabulary usage 
to meet students’ needs (Boyle et al., 2010). Exploring 
the impact of SLP  talk’s lexical complexity on children’s 
language skill development can contribute to developing 
effective practices for targeted intervention strategies 
(Justice et al., 2014; Suskind et al., 2016). 
Studies of teachers’ child-directed talk show that 
various aspects of this talk are highly variable within the 
classroom setting (Gámez & Lesaux, 2012; Hollo & 
Wehby, 2017; Hollo et al., 2020; Huttenlocher et al., 
2002). Huttenlocher et al. (2002) investigated the syntactic 
complexity of teachers’ talk in 40 preschool classrooms, 
finding that the proportion of complex sentences (i.e., 
multiclause utterances) produced by teachers varied from 
11% to 32%, with a mean of 21%. Similar findings occur 
in later grades. Hollo et al. (2020) analyzed the child-
directed talk of 28 general and special education teachers 
of kindergarten through fourth grade, finding evidence of 
variability in the quantity, vocabulary, and complexity of 
teachers’ language use as recorded during whole-class con-
tent area lessons. Specifically, the amount of talk based 
on total number of words ranged from 539 to 1,902 
words, and teachers’ use of different (unique) words 
ranged from 150 to 389 words per 10 min. Furthermore, 
the complexity of teachers’ talk measured by mean length 
of utterance ranged from 3.64 to 8.70 per 10 min, such 
that some teachers used relatively simple utterances aver-
aging about 3.6 utterances in length, whereas others used 
longer, more complex utterances. Gámez and Lesaux 
(2012) investigated teacher’s talk in 22 sixth-grade class-
rooms of English monolingual and language minority stu-
dents, revealing significant variability among teachers in 
quantity of input, syntactic complexity, and sophisticated 
vocabulary use across classrooms. 
Although classroom contexts (e.g., book reading, 
mealtime, and free-play) and child-level characteristics 
(e.g., individual language skills, language impairment, and 
concomitant disabilities) also contribute to the variability 
in adult’s talk (DeThorne & Channell, 2007; Gest et al., 
2006; 
Massey 
et 
al., 
2008), 
studies 
that 
partitioned 
between-SLP variance in predicting language gains among 
children with DLD showed that the individual SLP con-
tributes substantially to explaining variance in understand-
ing individual children’s language growth during therapy 
(Farquharson et al., 2020; Schmitt, Justice, & Logan, 
2017). Schmitt, Justice, and Logan (2017) coded on a 
moment-by-moment basis of all SLP talk that addressed 
language-specific targets. On average, SLP talk addressing 
language-specific targets ranged from about 1 min to more 
than 22 min per session (M = 11.8,  SD = 4.7).  In  a  study  
of adult patients receiving speech-language therapy, Sherrill

•
and Hengst (2022) also found variability in SLP talk time 
(percentage of spoken words) and mean length of turns: 
SLP talk time ranged from 52% to 78%, and SLPs’ mean 
length of turn, calculated by dividing the total spoken word 
count for each participant by their total interactional turn 
count, ranged from 6.7 to 15.2. 
Understanding child-directed talk among SLPs is 
essential because it may shed significant light on therapy 
processes and outcomes. SLPs’ use of language in terms 
of quantity and quality and their communication styles 
during therapy sessions may influence children’s percep-
tion and motivation to engage in therapy and respond to 
interventions (Sugden et al., 2020). A review by Leonard 
and Deevy (2017) highlighted the potential importance of 
language intervention approaches that focus on modifying 
SLP and other adults’ input to children with language dis-
orders. These scholars detailed the potential impacts of 
the input informativeness approach, which is designed to 
provide children with robust exposure to grammatical 
markers (e.g., tense–agreement morphemes) that are chal-
lenging to children with language disorders acquiring 
English. The toy talk intervention developed by Hadley 
et al. (2017) operationalizes the input informativeness 
approach by training parents to talk with their children 
during play in ways that maximizes overt exposure to 
tense–agreement markers (e.g., “the horse is running,” 
“the dog is sleeping”; see Hadley et al., 2017). Leonard 
and Deevy (2017) suggest that “input-oriented intervention 
procedures” (p. 1039) warrant additional attention in clinical 
research, given foundational work indicating that input-
based interventions have promising empirical support. 
To date, much of the research on SLP-directed ther-
apies for children with DLD has focused on the interven-
tion targets addressed during therapy, such as vocabulary, 
phonology, morphology, syntax, narrative, and literacy 
(Fey et al., 2017; Fierro & Storkel, 2017; Gillam et al., 
2014; Justice et al., 2014; Justice, Logan, et al., 2017; Plante 
et al., 2014; Schmitt, Justice, & Logan, 2017; Tambyraja 
et al., 2014). Linguistic characteristics of SLPs’ child-
directed talk, such as input quantity and complexity, have 
been less investigated yet warrant theoretical and practical 
consideration given their likely contribution to children’s 
language growth and potential significance in clinical inter-
vention. In the present study, we sought to understand the 
extent to which SLPs varied in the amount and characteris-
tics of their talk to children across time points. 
Testing the Stability of SLP Talk Dimensions 
Testing the stability of the dimensionality of SLP 
talk has both methodological and theoretical importance. 
Demonstrating measurement invariance across time is crit-
ical to ensure comparability, validity, interpretability, and 
accuracy in the analysis of change and stability in latent 
constructs. It provides a solid foundation for making 
meaningful inferences and drawing accurate conclusions 
about 
the 
relationships 
between 
variables 
and 
their 
change over time (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 
2002; Millsap, 2011). Any inference about changes over 
time may be misleading and inaccurate unless the pre-
mise of longitudinal measurement invariance is met 
(Dimitrov, 2010; Millsap & Cham, 2012). 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
demonstrating 
invariance 
across time in dimensions of SLP talk ensures that the 
latent constructs representing quantity, grammatical com-
plexity, and lexical complexity remain consistent and com-
parable throughout the duration of the study. This consis-
tency allows us to make meaningful comparisons of the 
relationships between dimensions across different time 
points, as well as the examination of changes in the 
dimensions themselves. Longitudinal measurement invari-
ance also allows us to evaluate the stability or change in 
the underlying constructs of SLP talk, track the develop-
ment of children’s language skills associated with these 
constructs, and draw valid conclusions about intervention 
approaches of SLP talk. Without measurement invariance, 
it is difficult to determine whether observed changes in 
factor means, variances, or relationships over time are due 
to actual changes in the corresponding dimensions or 
merely changes in the measurement properties of the com-
prising indicators (Wang & Wang, 2012). When measure-
ment invariance is established, we can confidently make 
valid conclusions about the stability or change in the 
dimensions of interest over time (Chen, 2007; Cheung & 
Rensvold, 2002; Millsap, 2011). 
We are unaware of prior work that has similarly 
focused on the dimensionality and stability of SLPs’ child-
directed talk. Specifically, we consider whether dimension-
ality of SLP talk, as well as the dimensions themselves, 
represents stable phenomena over time. The evaluation of 
a longitudinally stable dimensionality model provides a 
venue for future examinations on potential predictors of 
longitudinal changes in SLP talk, such as varying contexts 
of intervention or changing skills of children within 
speech-language therapy sessions. 
The Current Study 
The present study was designed to improve our 
empirical understanding of the nature of SLPs’ child-
directed talk during speech-language therapy sessions in 
the public schools, as a potential route to leveraging SLP 
talk as a means to improve child language outcomes and 
therapy efficacy. Specifically, this study had three aims. 
First, we examined variability in linguistic features of 
child-directed talk across 75 SLPs during BAU therapy

sessions; second, we determined the dimensional structure 
of SLPs’ child-directed talk in which we theorized dimen-
sionality to reflect distinct dimensions of quantity, gram-
matical complexity, and lexical complexity; third, we 
investigated the stability of the dimensional structure of 
SLPs’ child-directed talk across an academic year, namely, 
during fall, winter, and spring therapy sessions. 
Method 
Participants and Data Source 
The present study utilized data collected during a 
study titled Speech Therapy Experiences in the Primary 
Schools (STEPS), for which primary study methods were 
conducted from 2009 to 2011. STEPS was designed to 
examine the characteristics of BAU speech-language ther-
apy as delivered by SLPs in the public schools and to 
determine the extent to which observed and measured 
characteristics were associated with language growth for 
primary-grade students with DLD. Recruitment activities 
for STEPS were conducted upon the approval of the uni-
versity’s institutional review board. Details of STEPS are 
described in detail in prior reports (e.g., Justice, Jiang, 
et al., 2017), and here, we describe study methods of rele-
vance to the present study of SLPs’ child-directed talk. 
STEPS involved recruitment and participation of 
75 licensed and certified SLPs working in multiple public 
school districts in two states. To participate, SLPs were 
required to serve kindergarten, first, and/or second-grade 
students on their caseloads and have a minimum of four 
children in these grades on their caseloads who met cri-
teria for DLD, with and without concomitant diagnoses 
(such as autism, hearing loss, Down syndrome, and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). The 75 partici-
pating SLPs were primarily women (97.3%) and White 
(89.3%, Black = 8.0%, Hispanic = 2.7%). All of the 
SLPs had a master’s degree or higher (a doctorate), and 
all of the SLPs had a valid Certificate of Clinical Com-
petence from the American Speech-Language-Hearing 
Association as well as state licensure. On average, the 
SLPs had practiced for 15.53 years (SD = 11.04 years, 
range: 0–36 years). 
A total of 286 study children were in therapy ses-
sions with the participating SLPs, including 117 kindergar-
teners, 164 first graders, and five second graders. These 
children were, on average, 76 months old at the beginning 
of the academic year (SD = 8.4, range: 59–96 months). 
Ninety-two (32.2%) of the children were girls. More than 
half of the children were White (n = 156, 54.5%), 10.1% 
were African American (n = 29), 3.8% were Hispanic (n = 
11), 6.8% were other ethnicities (n = 19, including Asian 
and Native American), and the rest were unreported (n = 
71, 24.8%). The majority of the children speak English as 
their first language (n = 273, 95.5%). As an indicator of 
SES, 33.4% of families earned less than $40,000 (n = 96), 
25.6% earned between $41,000 and $80,000 (n = 74), 
16.8% earned more than $80,000 (n = 48), and the rest 
were unreported (n = 68, 24.2%). 
As part of the STEPS procedures, SLPs were asked 
to videotape and submit five therapy sessions for each of 
286 school-aged children who met study criteria and were 
enrolled in STEPS. To ensure the usability of these video 
submissions, each SLP was given instructions during a 
study orientation on videotaping and all materials to do 
so, including a camera, tripod, and recording media. 
Depending on the nature of service delivery, most ses-
sions involved only one child, some were conducted with 
small 
groups 
of 
two 
to 
four 
children, 
and 
several 
involved large groups in a classroom; furthermore, some 
sessions included several children in the study on the 
SLPs’ caseload, whereas other sessions featured enrolled 
children and nonenrolled peers. Evidence on the relations 
between group composition (individual vs. group) and 
children’s speech and language gains are scarce and 
mixed (e.g., Cirrin et al., 2010; Farquharson et al., 2020). 
Of note is that the SLPs in this study were asked to con-
duct therapy using their BAU practices and not to mod-
ify their therapy practices in any way; thus, the findings 
presented in this study represent naturalistic therapy 
experiences in the public schools. 
The data source from STEPS contained a total of 
806 therapy session videos from 75 SLPs representing 
five time points across one school year, collected roughly 
every 6 weeks over a 40-week period. The number of 
SLPs who submitted therapy videos at each of the five 
time points varied somewhat as well as the number of 
videos received. For Time Point 1, 100% of SLPs submit-
ted 211 videos; for Time Point 2, 56 SLPs submitted 114 
videos; for Time Point 3, 71 SLPs submitted 194 videos; 
for Time Point 4, 54 SLPs submitted 110 videos; and for 
Time Point 5, 71 SLPs submitted 177 videos. Because the 
sample sizes of both SLPs and total submitted videos 
were relatively small at Time Points 2 and 4, we chose 
Time Point 1, Time Point 3, and Time Point 5 to repre-
sent respectively the beginning, middle, and end of the 
school year for the present study (hereafter: Time Point 
1, Time Point 2, Time Point 3). Another reason for 
choosing these three time points was that the window for 
submitting session videos between time points was only 
6 weeks, and three measurements with a 12-week interval 
were optimal to examine a detectable (or lack of) change 
in SLP talk characteristics, a goal of this study. In total, 
a corpus of 582 videos of speech therapy sessions in the 
public schools were analyzed for this study.

Measurement of SLPs’ Child-Directed Talk 
Child-Directed Talk Indices and Dimensions 
For the present study, we analyzed the following eight 
indices of child-directed talk produced by each SLP in a ses-
sion video: (a) total number of utterances, (b) total number 
of words, (c) total number of auxiliary verbs and copulas, (d) 
total number of coordinating conjunctions, (e) total number 
of subordinating conjunctions, (f) total number of verbs, (g) 
total number of adjectives, and (h) total number of unique 
words. These eight linguistic indices are represented in the 
extant literature as being potentially important characteristics 
of adults’ talk with children based on empirical and theoreti-
cal considerations (e.g., Gámez & Lesaux, 2012; Hoff, 2003; 
Hollo et al., 2020; Huttenlocher et al., 2002; Rowe, 2008, 
2012). Table 1 provides a brief definition, example, and 
abbreviation for each of these indices for reference. 
Based on the existing literature (e.g., Hirsh-Pasek 
et al., 2015; Hoff, 2003; Justice et al., 2013; Rowe, 2008, 
2012), we hypothesized SLPs’ child-directed talk to reflect 
three distinct dimensions; namely, quantity, grammatical 
complexity, and lexical complexity. Accordingly, quantity 
was represented by the total number of utterances and total 
number of words in a therapy session. Grammatical com-
plexity was represented by the total number of auxiliary 
verbs and copulas, coordinating conjunctions, and subordi-
nating conjunctions. Lexical complexity was represented by 
the total number of verbs, adjectives, and unique words.

Processing of SLPs’ Child-Directed Talk 
The present study involved the analysis of SLP talk 
during 582 videotaped therapy sessions conducted in the 
public schools. Traditionally, the investigation of child-
directed talk from parents, teachers, and/or SLPs has fea-
tured language sample or conversational analysis often via 
automatized software such as Systematic Analysis of  
Language Transcripts (SALT; Miller & Iglesias, 2012) 
with established conventions for transcribing and coding 
these samples (e.g., Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015; Hoff, 2003; 
Huttenlocher et al., 2002). Although SALT and similar 
software can generate measures of various indices of 
child-directed talk, these require manual transcription 
and coding, which can be costly and time-consuming. 
Consequently, many studies of child-directed talk involve 
relatively small samples of adults or a focus on a single 
time point of adult–child interaction. Such methods limit

the application of statistical approaches requiring larger sam-
ples or involving repeated measures of adult talk over time. 
To address these study limitations, the present study 
involved application of an automatized tool for coding SLP 
talk, namely, the Interaction Detection in Early Childhood 
Settings (IDEAS; Gonzalez Villasanti et al., 2020). IDEAS 
procedures and accuracy are detailed by Chaparro-Moreno 
et al. (2023) and briefly summarized here. Using a corpus 
of 45 speech therapy session videos drawn from STEPS, 
with a total length of 18 hr (M = 23:42 [mm:ss]; range: 
05:58–32:33), IDEAS was trained to (a) segment SLP and 
child speech and identify speakers, referred to as diarization; 
(b) transcribe SLP and child talk using Amazon Transcribe 
speech-to-text service; and (c) automatically derive counts 
of linguistic indices in SLP talk using MATLAB (R2021b; 
The MathWorks Inc., 2021). The training and evaluation of 
IDEAS required manual transcription and manual diariza-
tion. After systematic training and passing reliability tests, 
two native English-speaking research assistants majoring in 
speech and hearing science created manual transcripts fol-
lowing the standard SALT conventions (SALT Software, 
LLC, 2020) in ELAN software (EUDICO Linguistic Anno-
tator; The Language Archive, 2022). Specifically, the speech 
stream was manually segmented into C-units, defined as an 
independent clause and its modifiers (Loban, 1976). The 
manual transcripts were cleaned to exclude unintelligible 
speech, nonspeech sounds (e.g., “mhm”), and incomplete 
utterances. Complete intelligible utterances with implicit sub-
jects or predicates and other intelligible utterances were con-
sidered in the corpus. The segmented C-units in the manual 
transcripts were then manually annotated with onset  and off-
set time stamps to identify speaker (i.e., manual diarization). 
Three evaluation metrics were used to examine 
IDEAS accuracy: F measure, median absolute relative 
error (ERRmedian), and correlation coefficient values (ρ). 
The F measure indicated accuracy in diarization by com-
paring IDEAS diarization against manual diarization. It 
represented the harmonic mean of precision and recall that 
ranges from 0 (poor score) to 1 (perfect score; Gonzalez 
Villasanti et al., 2020). IDEAS performed with high accuracy 
in diarization for SLP talk (F = 0.72; Chaparro-Moreno 
et al., 2023). ERRmedian and ρ were used to indicate accuracy 
of IDEAS for linguistic indices. The manual transcripts, auto-
matically processed by the linguistic unit estimation module 
of the IDEAS pipeline, were used to calculate ERRmedian and 
ρ. The ERRmedian provided information about IDEAS accu-
racy in estimating the counts of linguistic indices. The ρ indi-
cated the strength of the relationship between the counts of 
linguistic indices estimated in IDEAS and those estimated 
with manual transcripts (Räsänen et al., 2021). 
As shown in Table 2, except for the number of 
utterances (ρ = .42), correlations between IDEAS outputs 
and those estimated with manual transcripts for SLPs’ 
linguistic indices ranged from .71 to .85, above the accept-
able value of .70 (Räsänen et al., 2021). The comparatively 
lower correlation for the number of utterances (ρ = .42)  
could be attributable to the difference in diarization methods. 
While in manual diarization human transcribers used manual 
transcripts to segment speech in C-units, IDEAS was trained 
with manually diarized speech to automatically diarize tran-
script returned by Amazon Transcribe speech-to-text service 
using time-based segmentation (0.3-s pauses) and punctua-
tion marks. Although the correlation for number of utter-
ances was lower than the acceptable value of .70 (ρ = .42),  
its median absolute relative error rate (ERRmedian) was  lower  
than 20% (11.73%), which met the other criterion based on 
two evaluation matrices (Räsänen et al., 2021).

For the present study, IDEAS processed all 582 ses-
sion videos and returned outputs for video properties (total 
duration of the video and duration of SLP talk) and the 
eight child-directed talk indices referenced previously for 
each video. After IDEAS processed the video session, we 
examined video characteristics in the resultant data sets. At 
Time Point 1, one video was incomplete, and we excluded 
this video from the analysis. At both Time Points 1 and 2, 
we excluded one video because of low quality due to back-
ground noise, which might affect the accuracy of the lin-
guistic variables produced by IDEAS (Gonzalez Villasanti 
et al., 2020). Thus, the final corpus for analyses comprised 
579 videos from three time points across the school year. 
Data Analyses 
The first research aim was to explore variability in 
child-directed talk across the 75 SLPs. To address this 
aim, we aggregated the 579 session videos and averaged 
video property and linguistic indices data from up to three 
session videos for each SLP to represent between-SLP var-
iability, with the SLP as unit of analysis. We first explored

•
the characteristics of therapy session videos, such as the 
total duration of therapy sessions, the duration of SLP 
talk, and the proportion of the length of SLP talk in a 
therapy session. We also conducted descriptive statistics 
on the eight indices of SLPs’ child-directed talk. For these 
descriptive analyses, we did not make corrections based 
on the duration of SLP talk because some SLPs had lon-
ger sessions and some shorter, regardless of the quantity 
and quality of the SLP talk. This decision was based on 
our goal in representing the total amount of these SLP 
talk indices to which the children were exposed without 
respect to variability in session length, as done in several 
prior studies of adults’ child-directed talk (e.g., Gámez & 
Lesaux, 2012; Hoff, 2003; Hollo et al., 2020). 
The second aim sought to examine the dimensional-
ity of SLPs’ child-directed talk, in which we theorized 
dimensionality to reflect distinct dimensions of quantity, 
grammatical 
complexity, 
and 
lexical 
complexity. 
To 
address 
this 
aim, 
we 
empirically 
tested 
whether 
the 
hypothesized three-factor model fit our data at each time 
point as a baseline model using confirmatory factor analy-
ses with Mplus 8 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2017). In this 
model, the eight linguistic indices are loaded on the three 
factors (see Figure 1). Models were judged to have a good 
model fit if the comparative fit index (CFI) and the 
Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) were larger than .90, and if the 
standardized 
root-mean-square 
residual 
(SRMR) 
was 
smaller than .08 (West et al., 2012). The final aim sought 
to determine the stability of this multidimensional model 
of SLPs’ child-directed talk over time, pending the results 
pursuant to aim two. To address the third aim, we conducted 
longitudinal measurement invariance (LMI) analyses, which 
were tested over time using a set of nested models: configural, 
metric, and scalar invariance (Little, 2013). Specifically, the 
configural invariance sets factor loadings and item intercepts 
freely estimated to test the hypothesis that the same general 
pattern of factor loading holds across the three time points; 
the metric invariance sets the corresponding factor loadings 
equal across time points; and the scalar invariance requires 
the corresponding factor loadings and item intercepts equal 
across time points (Millsap & Cham, 2012). To evaluate the 
invariance at each level, the change in CFI (ΔCFI) was used, 
with changes smaller than .01, indicating that the more 
restrictive model was equivalent to the less restricted model 
(Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002). 
Results 
Variability of Child-Directed SLP Talk 
To examine the variability of child-directed talk 
among SLPs, we aggregated SLP data from the 579 video 
sessions to represent the talk characteristics of the 75 
SLPs. Descriptive statistics on video properties (i.e., total 
duration of session, duration, and proportion of SLP talk) 
and quantity and complexity indices of SLP talk at each 
time point are shown in Table 3. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
3, 
therapy 
sessions 
lasted 
approximately 23 min across the time points, with SLP 
talk (vs. child talk) comprising about 50% of therapy time 
(SLP talk proportion; 11 min of talk, on average). There 
was considerable variability among SLPs, as also can be 
seen by examining the standard deviation and range for 
these values. For instance, at Time Point 1, one SLP talked 
only 7% during therapy, while another talked 73%. At Time 
Point 2, the proportion of SLP talk ranged from 22% to 
72%. At Time Point 3, one SLP talked as little as 4% in 
therapy sessions, while another spoke as much as 76%. 
Intraclass correlation (ICC) indicated that SLP explained 
63.7% and 74.3% of the overall variation in session duration 
and proportion of SLP talk during therapy, respectively. 
SLPs varied widely in the quantity and quality of 
their talk as well, as observed across the eight talk indices

(see Table 3). For example, total number of utterances 
ranged from 44.5 to 595 among SLPs at Time Point 1, 
145.75 to 677 at Time Point, and 36 to 700 at Time Point 
3. In terms of grammatical and lexical complexity, for 
instance, the total number of subordinating conjunctions 
across SLPs ranged from zero to 28 at Time Point 1, 2.25 
to 34 at Time Point 2, and zero to 32.8 at Time Point 3, 
indicating that across three time points, some SLPs did 
not use subordinating conjunctions at all, while other 
SLPs used more complex utterances that had as many as 
34 dependent clauses. It is worth noting that at Time 
Point 1 and Time Point 2, all of the linguistic measures of 
the quantity and quality of SLP talk were evenly distrib-
uted. However, at the end of the school year (Time 
Point 3), some SLPs produced large numbers of coordi-
nating conjunctions (Kurtosis = 7.72) and unique words 
(Kurtosis = 6.31). ICC for the eight linguistic measures 
ranged from .431 to .659, indicating that SLPs explained 
43.1%–65.9% of the overall variation in quantity and 
quality of their talk across the three time points.

Dimensionality of Child-Directed SLP Talk 
As shown in Table 4, linguistic indices within each 
of the SLP talk dimensions were highly correlated at each 
time point and across the three time points. For instance, 
the two measures of quantity (number of utterances and 
number of words) were correlated at .89, .91, and .94, 
respectively, at the three time points. Across the three time 
points, the correlations between the quantity measures 
ranged from .55 to .91. Concurrent correlations between 
quantity, grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity 
measures were also high, ranging from .52 to .95 at Time 
Point 1, .51 to .94 at Time Point 2, and .60 to .96 at Time 
Point 3, respectively. A full table of all cross-dimensional 
and longitudinal correlation coefficients is presented in 
Table 4. These correlational patterns suggested that quan-
tity, grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity of 
SLP talk were intricately related and provided us the basis 
for the three–latent factor model. 
The proposed three-factor structure was tested as a 
baseline model at each time point. Model fit statistics are 
reported in the upper part of Table 5. The baseline model 
achieved good model fit at all three time points (CFI and 
TLI > .90, SRMR < .08; West et al., 2012), allowing for 
further tests of the LMI. The good fit of baseline models 
provided evidence for our proposed three-factor structure 
at all three time points, wherein quantity was represented 
by total number of utterances and words; grammatical com-
plexity was represented by total number of auxiliary verbs 
and copulas, coordinating conjunctions, and subordinating 
conjunctions; and lexical complexity was represented by 
total number of verbs, adjectives, and unique words. A dia-
gram for the dimensionality model is illustrated in Figure 1.

seemed to be higher at Time Point 2 than Time Point 1 
and Time Point 3. The maximum values of total number 
of unique words seemed to be higher at Time Point 3 than 
Time Point 1 and Time Point 2. Before testing longitudinal 
measurement invariance, we conducted a set of repeated-
measures analyses of variance to test the mean differences in 
SLP talk quantity and quality across the three time points. 
Results are summarized in Table 6. All measures of SLP 
talk, except for total number of adjectives (F = 5.00, p = 
.008), did not show a significant difference across the three 
time points. Bonferroni pairwise comparisons indicated that 
SLPs’ number of adjectives was significantly different 
between Time Point 1 and Time Point 3 (p = .018).

longitudinal measurement invariance models are summa-
rized in the lower part of Table 5. First, the configural 
model had a good model fit (CFI = .938, TLI = .908), 
indicating that the same general pattern of factor loadings 
for quantity, grammatical complexity, and lexical com-
plexity held stable across the three time points. Then, the 
metric model where the corresponding factor loadings 
were set equal had a good model fit (CFI = .941, TLI = 
.918). There was a nonsignificant change in chi-square 
between the configural and metric models (Δχ2 = 0.051, p 
> .05), and the change in CFI was smaller than .01 
(ΔCFI = .003), indicating that across the three time 
points, each linguistic measure within the three dimensions 
stably represented the quantity, grammatical complexity, 
and lexical complexity of SLP talk with similar weights. 
Lastly, the scalar model where item intercepts across time 
points were also set as equal had a good model fit (CFI = 
.946, TLI = .930). There was a nonsignificant change in 
chi-square between the metric and scalar models (Δχ2 = 
3.332, p > .05) and the change in CFI was smaller than 
.01 (ΔCFI = .005), indicating that any (lack of) change in 
SLP talk over time could be evaluated by the changes in 
the latent factors, namely, quantity, grammatical complex-
ity, and lexical complexity. In summary, the three-factor 
dimensionality model of SLP talk had good fit in longitu-
dinal measurement invariance models, suggesting that the 
three-dimensional structure of the linguistic measures in 
SLP talk held stable over the three time points across one 
academic year. The standardized factor loadings for the

Discussion 
Language input from the environment to which chil-
dren are exposed plays a significant role in children’s lan-
guage learning and development, which, in turn, is critical 
for the development of cognitive and noncognitive skills 
and school success (e.g., Hoff, 2003; Hollo et al., 2020; 
Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Roben et al., 2013). Among the 
factors contributing to children’s language learning and 
development, child-directed talk by parents and teachers 
builds on real-time interactions with children in conversa-
tions, movements, and activities that facilitate and prime 
language learning and growth (Golinkoff et al., 2019; 
Reed et al., 2017; Romeo et al., 2018). For children with 
DLD, speech-language therapy in school settings contrib-
utes substantially to the development of their language 
skills, and optimized child-directed talk positively influ-
ences their language learning (e.g., Castilla-Earls & Owen 
Van Horne, 2023; Cologon et al., 2017; Farquharson

•
et al., 2020; Kruythoff-Broekman et al., 2019; Owen Van 
Horne et al., 2023). Both quantity, the volume of talk to 
which children are exposed to, and quality, the grammati-
cal and lexical complexity of parents’ and teachers’ talk, 
are predictive to children’s language skills over time (e.g., 
Huttenlocher et al., 2010; Rowe, 2008; Suskind et al., 
2016; Weizman & Snow, 2001). 
A primary rationale for this work is to provide a 
basis for future clinical research that seeks to better iden-
tify dimensions of SLP talk that can be manipulated to 
benefit children’s language growth. Input-oriented inter-
vention approaches, such as Hadley et al.'s (2017) toy 
talk, build upon the premise that modifying the linguistic 
input to which children are exposed can accelerate chil-
dren’s acquisition of specific domains of language). In 
addition, Leonard and Deevy (2017) reviewed the theoreti-
cal basis and available evidence for three input-oriented 
intervention approaches; in these approaches, parents or 
clinicians modify their input to children with language dis-
orders to accelerate specific language skills, such as acqui-
sition of grammatical markers. While these approaches 
provide promising means to improve the impacts of ther-
apy for young children, there remains considerable limits 
in the knowledge base concerning SLPs’ talk during ther-
apy, as few studies have systematically examined linguistic 
characteristics of SLP talk to children during treatment. 
To this end, this study examined the measurement struc-
ture of linguistic indices in SLPs’ child-directed talk dur-
ing BAU therapy sessions and  longitudinal measurement 
invariance of the structure model to provide a premise 
for future inferences to be drawn about changes over 
time. Our analyses of a corpus of 579 speech-language 
therapy session videos from 75 SLPs contributed several 
key findings. 
Variability of SLP Talk Across a School Year 
The proportion of the length of SLP talk during the 
therapy sessions, and the linguistic indices of SLP talk in 
quantity and quality, varied widely at the beginning, mid-
dle, and end of the school year. The variability was attrib-
utable to individual SLP differences. These findings were 
consistent with existing research that showed significant 
differences in the quantity and quality of teachers’ talk in 
classrooms across different grades (Gámez & Lesaux, 
2012; Hollo et al., 2020; Huttenlocher et al., 2002). Our 
findings on the inherent variability in quantity and quality 
of SLP talk also aligned with previous findings on the var-
iability of individual differences among SLPs in their cov-
erage on language-specific targets during therapy sessions 
(Schmitt, Justice, & Logan, 2017). Furthermore, the indi-
vidual differences among SLP talk for school-aged chil-
dren with DLD coalesced with the variability in SLP talk 
directed to adult patients receiving speech-language ther-
apy services (Sherrill & Hengst, 2022). 
Findings from our study add to the evidence that 
adults’ child-directed talk appears to show inherent var-
iability, such that some talk is less sophisticated or less 
voluminous than other talk even within the same con-
text. Yet another aspect of child-directed talk by adults 
to children within educational settings warrants discus-
sion; that is, the variability of child-directed talk appears 
to be reflective of the context within which such talk 
takes place and/or the child’s characteristics. Given 
the appearance of inherent variability in adults’ child-
directed talk, to include that of SLPs, some efforts have 
focused on determining contributors to this variability. 
Classroom contexts, in particular, have received interest, 
with researchers proposing that differences in classroom 
context may contribute to variability in teachers’ child-
directed talk. For instance, Massey et al. (2008) exam-
ined cognitively challenging talk in preschool classrooms, 
finding that book-reading activities facilitated a greater 
amount of challenging talk than other activities. Gest et al. 
(2006) reported similar findings in preschool classrooms 
when examining various aspects of teachers’ child-directed 
talk during free play, mealtime, and book reading. Child-
directed talk coded as rich, which included talk focused on 
vocabulary enhancement and cognitive challenge, among 
others, most often occurred during book reading. Such 
work suggests that variations in context may contribute to 
the inherent variability of adults’ child-directed talk. 
However, variability of child-directed talk may also 
reflect characteristics of the child/ren who are the recipi-
ents of such talk. Adults may use more complex words 
and syntactic structures with children who have more 
sophisticated 
language 
skills. 
Although 
the 
relations 
between 
children’s 
linguistic 
sophistication 
and 
SLPs’ 
child-directed talk are beyond the scope of the current 
study, there is evidence in support of this point. In a study 
involving 29 children with DLD, DeThorne and Channell 
(2007) examined characteristics of an SLP’s child-directed 
talk during a conversational language sampling procedure 
and assessed the extent to which these reflected variability 
among children in the characteristics of their talk. Similar 
to the studies previously reviewed, there was substantial 
variability in characteristics of the SLP talk during the 29 
language samples. Across the 29 sessions, the SLP ranged 
in her use of different words from 150 to 226. Generally, 
student findings suggested that variability in the SLP’s 
child-directed talk reflected individual differences between 
children in their own language skill and expression. The 
correlation between the SLP’s number of different words 
and children’s syntactic complexity was practically and 
statistically significant (r = .724), suggesting that nearly 
50% of the variance in the SLP talk was explained by

children’s syntactic skills. Such findings may reflect a natural 
tendency by SLPs to calibrate the complexity of their talk to 
what they perceive or observe as the child’s latent language 
capabilities. However, in so doing, SLPs may inadvertently 
reduce the complexity of their talk across various dimen-
sions, which may reduce the richness of their talk and its 
potential role in enhancing children’s language development. 
Our study found that across the three time points, 
most linguistic measures of SLP talk (except for total 
number of adjectives) did not show a significant mean dif-
ference. Rowe (2012) found significant linear increase in 
the proportion of decontextualized utterances. Our nonsig-
nificant results may be due to the close window between 
sessions (12 weeks), as opposed to a longer (e.g., 1 year) 
gap of observations in other studies. The change of SLP 
talk may not manifest itself within such a short period of 
time within a year. It may also be possible that compared 
to typically developing children, SLP talk directed by chil-
dren with DLD did not show significant increase. 
Concurrent and Longitudinal Dimensional 
Structure of SLP Talk 
Our CFA analyses revealed that the proposed three-
factor structure of SLP talk consisting of quantity, gram-
matical complexity, and lexical complexity had good 
model fit at all three time points. Furthermore, we identi-
fied that the eight linguistic indices captured in SLP talk 
measured the same constructs over time: The measure-
ment properties in quantity (numbers of utterances and 
words), grammatical complexity (numbers of auxiliary 
verbs and copulas, coordinating conjunctions, and subor-
dinating conjunctions), and lexical complexity (numbers of 
verbs, adjectives, and unique words) were invariant across 
one school year. Good fit in longitudinal measurement 
invariance 
models 
of 
the 
three-factor 
dimensionality 
model suggested that the latent constructs of quantity, 
grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity in SLP 
talk were psychometrically equivalent and longitudinally 
viable for further examination of changes in the latent 
constructs of SLP talk over time. 
In pursuit of the understanding of the dimensionality of 
SLP talk, we seek to find ways to improve the linguistic 
aspects in SLP talk that may be predictive of children’s 
language gains over time because child-directed talk is mallea-
ble (Suskind et al., 2016). For example, in a parent–child 
language intervention study, researchers found significant 
increase in parents’ word tokens and types at the lab and sig-
nificant increase in parents’ word tokens and conversational 
turns at home after being given quantitative linguistic feed-
back and strategies designed to increase the quantity and 
quality of child-directed talk (Suskind et al., 2016). In another 
efficacy study, it was found that utterance length did not 
influence treatment outcomes for late talkers (Alt et al., 2021). 
It is to be discovered whether an increase or decrease in the 
quantity and complexity of SLP talk is associated with 
improved language skills for children with language impairment. 
Limitations and Future Directions 
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to 
examine the dimensionality of linguistic measures in SLP 
talk during BAU sessions and to test the longitudinal sta-
bility of such a dimensional structure. A few limitations 
should be noted. First, the videos analyzed in this study 
representing therapy sessions were collected between 2009 
and 2011. Mode, collaboration, assessment, and treatment 
may have undergone changes over the past decade. With 
COVID-19 and related school closures in the past few 
years, changes in service delivery have limited the possibil-
ity of in-person BAU therapy sessions and transformed 
the mode and delivery of language-specific target interven-
tions (Biggs et al., 2022; King et al., 2022). Our results 
should be interpreted with these considerations. Future 
studies with updated data are needed to reflect the current 
practices of SLP talk. Second, the sample length and dura-
tion of SLP talk from the videos may be a possible source 
of variability. Analyses revealed that a 20-min sample was 
the best for predicting teachers’ number of utterances and 
lexical diversity (Gámez & Lesaux, 2015), whereas the 
length of our samples ranged from approximately 11 to 
35 min. Third, the discrepancy in diarization methods 
between IDEAS and manual diarization might be an 
explanation for the comparatively lower correlation for 
the total number of utterances. These inherent limitations 
on 
automated 
measurements 
could 
be 
eliminated 
as 
IDEAS or other speech detectors are improved in the 
future. In addition, the linguistic indices of SLP talk that 
we examined represented only a fraction of what could be 
considered when examining SLPs’ talk to children. In this 
study, we focused primarily on measures of input fre-
quency, which are fairly narrow in terms of input mecha-
nisms that may influence children’s language development 
(Leonard & Deevy, 2017). Our rationale for narrowly 
focusing on measures of input frequency is that we utilized 
state-of-the-art technologies that automatically processed 
a large volume of SLP talk data. Studies that focus on 
more granular aspects of adult talk to children, such as 
frequency of object complement structures, utilize hand-
scored transcription and coding and thus involve fairly 
small participant pools (Hadley et al., 2017). We antici-
pate that future iterations of IDEAS will allow us to cap-
ture more granular aspects of SLP talk. 
Despite 
these 
considerations, 
our 
dimensionality 
model provides an avenue for future directions to examine 
predictors of longitudinal changes in SLP talk and guide

linguistic strategies in intervention studies. Using the 
established dimensional structure of SLP talk from our 
extensive data, the next step for the research team is to 
explore the associations between SLP- and session-level 
characteristics and the linguistic dimensions in SLP talk. 
For example, SLP-level factors such as job satisfaction 
and session-level characteristics such as service delivery 
model (individual session vs. multiple children in a session) 
and session length may contribute to the variability of SLP 
talk. Another aspect of future investigation is to examine 
the relations between SLP and child talk’s linguistic proper-
ties and sophistication and to identify dimensions of SLP 
talk that contribute uniquely to children’s language growth 
over time. In turn, our goal is to identify malleable dimen-
sions of SLP talk that can be manualized in input-based 
interventions and scaled into practice by SLPs working in 
school settings. An emerging body of clinical research shows 
great promise for input-based interventions to enhancing 
language outcomes for children with language disorders.
