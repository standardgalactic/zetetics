It has long been hypothesized that perceptual ambiguities play an important role in aesthetic experience: a work with some
ambiguity engages a viewer more than one that does not. However, current frameworks for testing this theory are limited
by the availability of stimuli and data collection methods. This paper presents an approach to measuring the perceptual
ambiguity of a collection of images. Crowdworkers are asked to describe image content, after different viewing durations.
Experiments are performed using images created with Generative Adversarial Networks, using the Artbreeder website. We
show that text processing of viewer responses can provide a fine-grained way to measure and describe image ambiguities.

INTRODUCTION
“When looking at a picture, one should say that the
more associations it can open up the better."
—Pablo Picasso [7]
When confronted with a new image, the human visual system automatically tries to make sense of it [26, 29, 33,
34]. Some images are easy to interpret, but others require more effort because they are ambiguous, multivalent,
or indeterminate. Art theorists have argued that visual art often exploits ambiguity in order to engage viewers by
simultaneously suggesting and concealing the meaning of a work, or by evoking multiple diverse meanings [12],
as Picasso suggests in the quote above. Time plays an important role in these theories: some images are confusing
at first, but then lead to an “Aha” moment as the subject is recognized [21, 25], whereas images that appear simple
at first but become more perplexing over time are sometimes called “indeterminate" [27]. Indeterminacy is a
major theme in modern visual art [12, 28], e.g., Gerhard Richter is an example of a major contemporary artist
who deliberately creates and values indeterminate images [31] (Fig. 1).
Can we analyze these image properties quantitatively? Several recent authors have attempted to categorize
them [22, 23, 27, 28], and to put them in the context of neuroscience theories [15, 35]. However, experimentation
remains difficult. Previous studies have tended to use “handmade” artworks [9, 18, 19, 22, 24, 36, 37]. For example,
most methods compare artworks made by one artist to works by another artist, or to works by the researchers.
Such images have several limitations when used as experimental stimuli. For example, viewers’ judgments may
be influenced by historical, stylistic, or contextual factors not of direct relevance to the study. Highly-simplified
graphics, such as Mooney faces, have also been used as stimuli [21], but generalizing from these results is also
challenging. Moreover, previous studies typically ask high-level subjective questions of in-person participants,

including whether or not an image is ambiguous or contains an object. As a result, the conclusions from these
methods are promising but necessarily limited.
This paper proposes an approach to measuring perceptual ambiguity in artistic images. Study participants are
shown an image for a fixed duration, and asked to describe the contents of the image. We hypothesized that the
quantity and diversity of the descriptions would provide a measure of perceived ambiguity. We also hypothesized
that the distribution of responses would vary for different viewing durations, reflecting how perception of an
image evolves over time.
For stimuli, we use images from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [14]. Specifically, we gather popular
images from the website Artbreeder.com, since these images span a range of ambiguity and indeterminacy [16].
These stimuli avoid some of the limitations of previous studies: they are presented in their “native” format as
digital images, they minimize art historical or contextual confounds, they are visually rich, relatively free of
stylistic bias, and can be generated in large numbers.
Understanding ambiguous and indeterminate images is important not only for art theory and history but for
our understanding of human image perception more generally. We show that histograms and entropy of viewer
response can capture and summarize image ambiguities. Our results suggest how these kinds of studies could
help describe, categorize, and measure the space of image ambiguity.

PERCEPTUAL STUDY AND DATA PROCESSING
Image stimuli: To form the image dataset, we manually identified a set of 150 images from Artbreeder.com that
appeared to exhibit variations in image ambiguity. All images were taken from Artbreeder’s “General” class, which
provides images from the BigGAN model [5]. The first 120 images were manually selected from among the most
popular images on Artbreeder, and loosely categorized into 4 categories of 30 images each: “Recognizable” (e.g.,
Fig. 2(top)), “Dichotomous” (depicting two or more distinct objects simultaneously, e.g., Fig. 7(d,e)), “Indeterminate”
(open to multiple interpretations, e.g., Fig. 2(bottom)), and "Abstract” (clearly containing no objects, e.g., Fig. 7(a,f)).
We manually constructed the remaining thirty, “AbstractFlat”, (e.g., Figure 7(g,h)) to be highly abstract, using the
site’s “gene editing” interface, by increasing the BigGAN truncation parameter via the “chaos gene” control and
setting all presented embedding coordinates to -1.

Toward Quantifying Ambiguities in Artistic Images

Task design: We crowdsourced descriptions using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. A task consisted of a sequence
of 30 images, all from a single category of the stimuli set, to avoid confounding effects. Participants viewed
each image for either 0.5 or 3 seconds; the viewing duration was fixed for a single participant, but randomized
across participants. After the image disappeared, participants completed an attention vigilance task whereby
they reported the last location on the screen where they looked (based on a similar task design [11]). Then,
participants entered a freeform text description. They were instructed to describe the scene and any objects in
the image, “even if the image looks abstract at first”. We recruited 70 participants for each of the two viewing
durations and 5 categories from our stimuli set (launching 700 tasks in total). We filtered participants based on
the attention vigilance task. After filtering, we have on average 20.4 descriptions per image and viewing duration.
Sample images and descriptions are shown in Figures 2(a,b), and 3.
Viewing duration: Human perception studies have shown that retention of visual details plateaus by 3 seconds
of perception [3, 4], while half a second allows for most visual information to enter conceptual working memory
without interference [10, 30]. We ran a pilot study with viewing durations of 300 ms, 500 ms, 1000 ms, and 3000
ms. Participants complained that 300 ms was too brief to understand what was depicted, while results at 1000
and 3000 ms were very similar. Thus, for our main experiment, we chose to collect data at two durations: 500 ms
and 3000 ms.
Post-processing: Given the raw textual descriptions of a given image, we perform some simple text processing
to form a histogram of responses (Figure 2(c)). We treat the set of responses as a “bag-of-words" [17]. Specifically,
for each text description, we run a part-of-speech tagger [2], and keep only the nouns. We also discard any terms
in a predefined set of 12 disallowed words, such as “abstract" and “art”. Synonyms are grouped using NLTK [1],
yielding a set of tokens. We then form a histogram of the tokens for the image, grouped by viewing duration.
This process is performed separately for each image’s responses.
Given these histograms, we measure ambiguity with two numbers: H0.5 is the Shannon entropy of the 0.5-
second viewing duration histogram, and H3 is the entropy of the 3-second histogram. We report entropy scores
in units of bits.
3
CATEGORIZING AND RANKING AMBIGUITIES
Our key assumption is that the distribution of textual descriptions for a given image and a given time duration
reflect the perceptual ambiguity that a single viewer has for that image. This could arise, for example, if, when
forced to describe an image, a viewer samples a single possible explanation from their posterior probability
distribution. Similar processes have been hypothesized elsewhere in neuroscience [8].
Hence, the histogram of responses acts as an estimate of a typical viewer’s probability distribution over image
interpretations, for a given viewing duration. We can observe several types of images. In a determinate image,
(Figure 2(top row)), most viewers describe the image in the same way at both viewing durations; that is, both
H0.5 and H3 are low. In an indeterminate image (Figure 2(bottom row)), descriptions are highly varied in both
conditions.
Figure 3 shows the images with the lowest and highest entropy across descriptions. As can be seen in the figure,
this metric reflects the degree of recognizability of the images. Moreover, note that none of the “AbstractFlat”
images appear here. Sometimes they have high entropy (e.g., Figure 7(g)), and sometimes they have lower entropy
due to a peak of color descriptions like “pink image” (e.g., Figure 7(h)). This suggests that perhaps entropy alone
can identify indeterminate images. An image which is too abstract does not conjure many associations, nor does
an image which is very realistic. Indeterminacy seems to produce the longest and most varied descriptions.
Figure 4 shows high-entropy images sorted by the entropy difference H3 −H0.5 under the condition of
H3 > 4. This threshold gives us images which generate more associations after 3s viewing. When sorted by the
entropy difference, we see that more complex images tend to have greater decrease in entropy over time. The

Fig. 2. Our perceptual study pipeline summarizes the distribution of how participants describe an image after a fixed viewing
duration. Top Row: A sample stimulus image is shown in the upper-left. In the middle column, sample descriptions are shown
for each image, along with the text tokens extracted by our processing. Note that the descriptions are quite homogenous
for the top row: nearly all participants describe the first image as a cat. This is reflected in the histogram of tokens on the
upper right, for both time durations. The entropies are correspondingly low: H0.5 = 1.55, H3 = 1.80. The "[other]" histogram
bin counts tokens that appeared only once each. Bottom row: A more indeterminate image yields much more variability in
descriptions, and the variability increases considerably over time: H0.5 = 5.07, H3 = 5.45.
complementary examples are shown in Figure 5, where the threshold is set to H3 < 4. Here the images all seem to
depict individual objects. Entropy appears to decrease the most where the object is odd but recognizable. Entropy
appears to increase for images that seem to be complex variations on familiar objects.
Figure 6 shows a scatterplot of the entropies of images across our dataset. As shown in the plot, the image
categorization that we used to build the dataset emerges in some regions of the plot; for example, recognizable
images generally have lower entropy scores (H0.5,H3 < 4). Dichotomous images, such as Figure 7(d,e) have
simple explanations at first, but diverge as viewers find two or more interpretations.
Figure 7 shows a sampling of cases with high entropy. We now discuss some of the phenomena that emerge.
The first three images have high entropy (H3 > 4.5), and entropy decreases over time (H0.5 > H3). In Figure 7(a),
the most-frequent terms in the 0.5s viewing condition are “coat”, “knife”, and “cloth”, but, in the 3s condition,
entirely new terms become prevalent, including “building”, “ship”, and “sails”. In Figure 7(b) most descriptions in
the 0.5s condition include “face”, and even more do in the 3s condition, while several terms, like “bug”, “helmet”,
and “monster”, disappear. In Figure 7(c), “flowers” is rare in the initial condition, but becomes much more common
after the longer viewing duration.

Fig. 3. The images in our dataset with the lowest and highest entropy (H3) of descriptions. Some sample descriptions are
included. Observe that entropy appears to reflect image ambiguity/recognizability, and very indeterminate images have the
highest entropy.
In Figure 7(d,e,f), entropy increases: viewers first give consistent “first impression” descriptions, such as
“buffalo”, “dog” and “knife”, but the descriptions become considerably more varied and diverging when viewers
have spent more time viewing them.
The final images are two examples that could be seen as purely abstract art, yet viewers can occasionally
perceive objects within them, though less consistently. Most tokens appear only once, as indicated by the large
“[other]” category.

DISCUSSION
Our work is the first to attempt to go beyond the high-level impressions of ambiguity by viewers, to instead
uncover and quantify how ambiguous an image is across a population of viewers. It is partly motivated by a
desire to investigate whether modern computational methods can be used to address longstanding questions
about subjective responses to images, particularly in light of the claims made by artists, such as Picasso, about
what makes certain images aesthetically valuable.
As we show, the textual response histograms generated by our method robustly capture image properties like
indeterminacy, measuring shades of ambiguity which previous studies were insensitive to.
Our preliminary study is intended to illustrate the potential value of this approach for measuring the subtle
and highly subjective phenomenon of visual ambiguity. There are several limitations and directions for future

Observe that the entropy values cluster some categories well, including recognizable (H0.5,H3 < 4) and dichotomous

development. First, we are yet to validate the indeterminacy hypothesis suggested by the art theoretical literature,
that there is a positive correlation between image ambiguity and aesthetic appreciation. The tools and methods
developed here provide a useful starting point from which to rigorously investigate this claim in future.
Second, on the basis of previous literature, we expected to find an increase in entropy over time for images
with high levels of indeterminacy. We did not see this specific effect in our results (Figures 3–5), but we did
find change in entropy to provide some differentiation between types of ambiguity. In fact, our results suggest
that entropy alone can measure indeterminacy: if one wishes to follow Picasso’s goal of producing the most
associations, an image should not be realistic, but it should also not be too abstract.
Third, our text processing procedure is very simple. As a result, it discards some important information in
the textual descriptions, e.g., it cannot distinguish between an image having diverse descriptions because the
image is confusing (“it’s either a horse or a chair”), because it is dichotomous (“it’s a chair made to look like a
horse”), because it is complex (“it’s a horse next to a chair”), or because the description is verbose (“it’s a chair
sitting on the ground”). Our heuristic list of disallowed words could be replaced with a more nuanced filtering.
It is also unclear how best to take advantage of semantic similarity between descriptions that use distinct but
related words. Our text processing method ignored phrases that indicated difficulty or inability to respond, such
as “I’m not sure but...” or “I have no idea”, which occurred frequently for images in our indeterminate categories;
the frequency of such phrases could be used to further inform the analysis. Application of more sophisticated
text processing can yield more reliable and finer-grained insights.
Another important future step is to relate entropies to aesthetic properties. If semantic diversity and uncertainty
are regarded as positive aesthetic attributes in artworks, as the art historical literature suggests, then we might
expect to find a correlation between these qualities and entropy. Indeed, previous researchers have found
such a positive effect [19]. As a preliminary test, we asked a separate sample of 128 crowdworkers to rate the

images according to their level of “interestingness”, “powerfulness”, and “engagement”; however, we found that
crowdworkers gave highest scores to realistic, easily-interpretable images. There may be many reasons for this
finding that do not necessarily invalidate the main hypothesis of this study, including viewer expectations for
which images constitute art images versus non-art images, the framing and setup of the task, and the expertise of
the raters, each of which may need to be controlled for in future experiments.
The exposure times used in the present study were relatively short, particularly in the context of art viewing
where a museum-goer might typically spend at least several tens of seconds studying an artwork in order to
appreciate its nuances, and may return to look at it more than once [6]. Our crowdworkers often commented
that they had too little time to complete their descriptions. Exposures in the order of tens of seconds or minutes
may yield more complex and nuanced responses.
We thus far have only studied ambiguity of object recognition, whereas other image properties like figure-
ground segmentation may also be ambiguous. However, our methodology suggests a general approach for
probing perceptual uncertainty that could be combined with methods for crowdsourcing other image properties
[13, 20, 32], to obtain a rich analysis of image ambiguity.
A suitably rich model of image ambiguity can open up exciting future avenues for image synthesis applications.
For instance, such a model may be able to guide GANs and related image synthesis pipelines towards more
interesting and unexpected creations. It may be used to automatically curate or filter image streams, or as an
alternative metric of diversity to score different image synthesis techniques.
Finally, the methods being developed here could provide a potentially powerful computational framework for
studying topics of interest to psychologists and neuroscientists, such as image perception, object recognition,
and associative memory.
