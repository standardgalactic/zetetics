The Complexity of Public-Private

Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
1.1.	
Introduction: implementing complex 
infrastructure projects
Every now and then you read or hear about some infrastructure project that (continues to) 
exceed(s) its budget and/or completion date. Famous examples are the Big Dig in Boston 
and the UK Channel Tunnel.1 A well-known topical example from the Netherlands is 
the Amsterdam Metro North-South Line of which the costs have already increased from 
€ 1.4 billion to € 3.1 billion and of which the completion date has been postponed to 
2017.2 Often we find somebody to blame for the situations that projects encounter in their 
implementation processes, such as decision-makers, policy-makers, planners, managers, the 
public procurer, or the private contractor. This is understandable. It is a comforting idea 
that dealing with the culprit, and devising measures to make sure that the situations never 
occur again, allows us to do better in other (future) projects. All that needs to be done is 
to sanction the people or public and private organizations in charge, and/or to change 
the rules of infrastructure project development. The North-South Line, for instance, has 
known many culprits, it is said (e.g., aldermen, project directors, and private contractors).3 
But things are not always this simple. Blaming and sanctioning those in charge, and chang-
ing the rules or implementing new rules, may help but not necessarily so.
Implementation processes of infrastructure projects are fundamentally complex en-
deavors.4 When a project is implemented, i.e., when the project interacts with the existing 
socio-physical system, it would be naive to expect that system not to react in any way. 
When a bridge or tunnel is being produced along with the noise nuisance that often 
comes with it, neighboring citizens might complain. When a site is being excavated, some 
archeological treasures, or dangerous remnants from a wartime long gone, may be encoun-
tered. When plans are developed to change the layout of a highway network, stakeholders 
will have their favorite scenarios that they may pursue. And many more examples of such 
events can be imagined. The North-South Line project too has (had) its fair share of 
events.5 There are also events that occur in implementation processes of infrastructure 
projects that are arguably not caused or triggered by the project itself. Examples are eco-
nomic crises or changing laws and regulations.
It is unlikely that many of these situations would not occur after the people or pub-
lic and private organizations in charge have been sanctioned, and/or after the rules of 
infrastructure development have been changed. Moreover, public and private managers 
of infrastructure projects are constrained in foreseeing the occurrence of many of these 
events. There are limits to their predictive capacities, no matter how much information 
is collected and analyzed in planning for the projects. Even if it is concluded that an 
event ‘was bound to happen’, these are often explanations in hindsight. Sure, ‘if only

we/they had known then that which we/they know now, then we/they would, could, or 
should have…’ But the point is that often it was not known, or not completely known. In 
implementation processes – once the shovel hits the ground – of public-private partner-
ship (PPP) infrastructure projects, many events occur that were, at least to some extent, 
unforeseen and unplanned. If we accept this, the focus shifts from ‘who is to be blamed 
or sanctioned’ to ‘evaluating what can be learned from both better and worse experiences 
with responding to events in implementation’, so as to improve other (future) projects. 
That is one of the aims of the present study. Given the fundamentally complex nature of 
implementing infrastructure projects, however, this imposes requirements on the evalua-
tion methodology. These requirements are addressed in this study.
Before presenting the research question of this thesis, the next section first paints the 
contours of the background against which this study has been conducted (Section 1.2). 
The research question and outline of the thesis are then provided in Section 1.3. Section 1.4 
continues by articulating the practical relevance of the research question, indicating what 
evaluators, implementation managers, and planners of infrastructure projects can take 
from this thesis. Thereafter, the thesis is positioned theoretically and methodologically, 
and the intended contributions to the theoretical and methodological fields are articulated 
(Section 1.5). The concluding section provides some final remarks (Section 1.6).
1.2.	
Background: transportation infrastructure 
development in the Netherlands
This study is about the management of implementation processes of PPP infrastructure 
projects. It has been conducted against the background of the wish of Dutch policy- and 
decision-makers to improve the development processes of transportation infrastructure 
projects. Numerous reports that appeared over the years are testimony to the fact that this 
wish is both longstanding and incompletely realized.
1.2.1.	
A history of time delays and cost overruns
Some twenty-five years ago, the Dutch government requested the Scientific Council 
for Government Policy (WRR)6 to issue an advice on how decision-making concerning 
transportation infrastructure projects could be accelerated, as it observed that the lengthy 
decision-making procedures bore with them high administrative, social, and economic 
costs (WRR, 1994a). The WRR initiated a large study of twenty projects, and three years 
later it published its main findings (1994a) including several background studies (1994b; 
1994c). Amongst other things, the study found, first, that the root causes for the lengthy 
processes were the legal and regulatory complexity combined with the involvement of 
6	
The WRR – in Dutch: Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid – is the independent advisory body 
for the Dutch government, which is tasked with identifying and advising on future trends and develop-
ments (see www.wrr.nl).

many public authorities. Second, projects were often managed as a technical challenge to 
be confronted (i.e., planned) in closed circles, which were subsequently and consequently 
subject to fierce sociopolitical opposition.7 Six years later, a report published by the 
Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB)8 and the Netherlands Economic 
Institute (NEI)9 also mentioned the problems of spatially integrating transportation 
infrastructure projects in the densely built and populated Netherlands, which complicates 
the government’s balancing of the interests of different stakeholders (CPB & NEI, 2000c).
Three years later, in 2003, the Dutch House of Representatives decided to set up a 
Temporary Committee on Infrastructure Projects (TCI)10 – also known as the Committee 
Duivesteijn – to investigate how the parliamentary oversight of transportation infrastruc-
ture projects could be improved. The immediate causes for creating the TCI were the 
increasing costs of the Dutch Betuweroute and HSL-South projects (TCI, 2004b): the 
budget of the former had risen from € 2.335 billion in 1992 to € 4.799 billion in 2004 
(TCI, 2004c), and the HSL-South had experienced a budget increase from € 1.423 billion 
in 1991 to € 6.509 billion in 2004 (TCI, 2004d).11 A year later, the Committee published 
its main report and accompanying background studies (2004a; 2004b). Interestingly, in its 
report the Committee indicated the persistent complexity of transportation infrastructure 
projects as subjacent to the budget overruns (2004b:15):12
“[Another] constant factor in large infrastructure projects is the great dynamics and 
complexity. Their course is persistently unlike planned, they are influenced by many 
unpredictable trends and events, and the processes within which they are developed 
are extremely complex. […]. A symptom of this complexity is the systematic overrun 
of the budgets of infrastructure projects.”
As will be argued later in this thesis, the Committee hit the nail on the head when it 
alluded to the ‘dynamic’ and ‘complex’ nature of transportation infrastructure projects, 
and to the occurrence of ‘unplanned’ and ‘unpredicted’ events throughout the projects’ 
development processes.
The Dutch government studies cited above are concerned with the interrelated prob-
lems of time delays (in particular WRR, 1994a) and budget overruns (in particular TCI, 
2004b) of transportation infrastructure projects. The studies were followed by develop-
7	
These were no new problems, though. De Hoo (1982) showed that conflicts of interest and governance 
problems also contributed to lengthy decision-​making processes on infrastructure projects as early as the 
beginning of the 1960s.

rent and future government policies. The CPB is part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but operates 
independently of it (see www.cpb.nl).

ments in, inter alia, the ex-ante evaluation of transportation infrastructure projects (see 
De Jong & Geerlings, 2003; 2004; Geerlings & De Jong, 2004), such as new guidelines 
for cost-benefit analysis (CPB & NEI, 2000a; 2000b)13 and parliamentary control (see 
Priemus, 2007a). Unfortunately, such developments have been too late in the day for 
the Betuweroute and HSL-South projects. They took many years to be completed, and 
they went down in history with price tags of approximately € 4.7 billion and € 7.2 bil-
lion, respectively (Cantarelli, Flyvbjerg, Van Wee, & Molin, 2010; Cantarelli, 2011). Real 
progress in the development processes of transportation infrastructure projects seemed yet 
a wish unfulfilled.
This phenomenon of poor project performance is not limited to the Netherlands 
though. A large international comparative study that was conducted by Bent Flyvbjerg 
and his colleagues around the turn of the millennium, probably the best-known study on 
the subject, revealed that infrastructure projects suffer from budget overruns, worldwide 
and throughout the decades (Flyvbjerg, Skamris Holm, & Buhl, 2002; 2003; Flyvbjerg, 
2007a; 2008; Skamris Holm & Flyvbjerg, 1997).14 Research also points to the lengthy 
completion times of projects as an international problem (Short & Kopp, 2005). At this 
point, studies could be cited here ad nauseam (some references can be found in Chapter 3 
of this thesis) that tantamount to the same findings as those of Flyvbjerg and colleagues, 
but such is not the purpose here. The point is that there was still progress to be made in the 
development processes of infrastructure projects. This did not go unnoticed by policy- and 
decision-makers in the Netherlands.15 Several roads towards improvement were embarked 
on.
1.2.2.	 Embarking on roads towards improvement
In 2007, the Dutch Minister of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management 
(V&W)16 set up the Committee Acceleration Decision-Making on Infrastructure Projects 
(VBI)17 – also known as the Committee Elverding. With the installation of this commit-
tee, attention shifted back again to the problem of time delays (cf. Priemus, 2010). The 
issue, addressed with the large study of the WRR over a decade earlier (WRR, 1994a), 
resurfaced as the Committee VBI was asked to analyze the delays of transportation infra-
structure projects and to investigate the possibilities to accelerate the decision-making on 
them (Advisory Committee VBI, 2008). The Committee’s final report (2008) pointed to, 
inter alia, administrative red tape, insufficient management knowledge and capacity, and 
complex and sectoral laws and regulations as causes for the delays. The similarities between

Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
these findings and those of the WRR (see Section 1.2.1) are striking. Apparently, not much 
had improved in fourteen years. The problems with the development of transportation 
infrastructure projects were persistent and still very much on the political agenda.
One road of improvement that was embarked was that of the private financing of 
public transportation infrastructure projects. Already in 1994, the WRR observed that 
“the central government attempts to get certain projects off the ground more rapidly” with 
private financing (1994b:208), although the WRR itself was skeptical about it: “whether 
time is always gained with this is questionable” (1994b:208). Nevertheless, the issue of PPP 
caught the attention of Dutch policy- and decision-makers from the late 1980s onwards 
(Dewulf & Castaño, 2013; Eversdijk, 2013; Klijn, 2009),18 although the associated high ex-
pectations contrasted sharply with the difficulties experienced in the actual formation (i.e., 
contracting and procurement) of PPPs (e.g., Klijn & Teisman, 2003; Koppenjan, 2005; 
Van Ham & Koppenjan, 2002). Also, the aforementioned Betuweroute and HSL-South 
projects are testimony to the fact that involving the private sector does not automatically 
yield better results (Gerrits & Marks, 2014; Koppenjan & Leijten, 2005a; 2005b; 2007). 
Despite such bitter pills, PPPs continued to receive the interest of policy- and decision-
makers (Dewulf & Castaño, 2013; Eversdijk, 2013; Klijn, 2009). In 2008, the subject was 
again put to the fore with the publication of the report of the Committee for Private Fi-
nancing of Infrastructure (PFI),19 also known as the Committee Ruding (Committee PFI, 
2008). In its report, “the Committee advocate[d] a more active use of private financing for 
road and rail infrastructure” (2008:6) for it can lead to, inter alia, “better value-for-money” 
and “acceleration of the realization of infrastructure” (2008:9). As the Netherlands were 
strongly influenced by the policies and discussions in the United Kingdom about the Pri-
vate Finance Initiative (Klijn & Van Twist, 2007; Klijn, Edelenbos, & Hughes, 2007), the 
Committee PFI specifically advocated that PPPs would have a DBFM (i.e., Design, Build, 
Finance, and Maintain) format. In DBFM, the private contractor is not only concerned 
with designing and building the transportation infrastructure, but also with maintain-
ing and (partly) financing it.20 However, only few DBFM transportation infrastructure 
projects have been realized in the Netherlands (e.g., Eversdijk, Nagelkerke, Sewbalak, 
Van den Blink, & Rodenburg, 2011): four years after the publication of the report of 
the Committee PFI, the Ministry of Finance (2012) reported nine DBFM transportation 
infrastructure projects that were in the procurement, realization, or exploitation phase (cf. 
18	
This is not to say that PPPs are a new phenomenon. Grimsey and Lewis (2004), for instance, provide 
historical examples of toll concessions – in Greece in the 1st century BC/​AD, and in Britain during the 
Middle Ages – by public bodies to private parties, in return for which the private parties would maintain 
the roads. Also, the interest in PPPs in the Netherlands was not restricted to the development of transport 
infrastructure projects (see, e.g., Kreukels & Spit, 1990).

See, e.g., Eversdijk and Korsten (2009) for an elaborate account of the characteristics of, motivations for, 
and developments of DBFM in the Netherlands. See also the DBFM Handbook that was published by the 
Knowledge Centre PPP (2008). As relatively few DBFM projects have been delivered, the jury is still out 
as to whether DBFM lives up to its promises.

Rijkswaterstaat, 2013b). One of these projects, the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein (A15 MaVa), 
will be analyzed in the fifth chapter of this thesis (see also Chapters 6 and 7).
Another development that materialized in 2008 was the replacement of the Multi-
Year Program for Infrastructure and Transport (MIT)21 with the Multi-Year Program for 
Infrastructure, Space, and Transport (MIRT)22 (Ministries of V&W, VROM, EZ, & LNV, 
2007). Basically, the MIRT is the state government’s spatial investment program that 
provides a framework for the decision-making and planning of projects. The development 
from MIT to MIRT is indicative for the emergence of a more area-oriented approach to 
spatial planning in the Netherlands (Heeres, Tillema, & Arts, 2012; Tillema & Arts, 2009). 
The coherence between different policy fields (e.g., mobility, housing, and nature), spatial 
scales, (local, regional, and national) and governments (local, regional, and national) is 
at the center of the MIRT (Verweij & Gerrits, 2011). By increasing the coherence, it is 
expected that projects are not in each other’s hair (which could lead to project delays and 
budget overruns) in the already densely built and populated Netherlands. Rather, by in-
volving more policy fields, spatial scales, and government layers, spatial planning – which 
includes transportation infrastructure – can be better coordinated, resulting in an opti-
mized use of financial means and physical space (Ministries of I&M, EL&I, & BZK, 2011; 
Ministries of V&W, VROM, EZ, LNV, & WWI, 2010; Ministry of I&M, 2013). The A2 
Maastricht project, which is analyzed in the fourth chapter of this thesis (see also Chapters 
6 and 7), is a good example of a project in which this coherence seems to be realized (Van 
Gils, Verweij, & Gerrits, 2011; Verhees, 2013).
A third pathway of improvement concerns evaluation. The Netherlands Institute for 
Transport Policy Analysis (KiM)23 published several reports from 2008 onwards that are 
concerned with the ex-ante evaluation of transportation infrastructure projects including 
cost-benefit analysis (KiM, 2008a; 2008b; 2010), and their ex-post evaluation (KiM, 2009; 
PBL & KiM, 2010). In its reports about ex-post evaluation, the KiM stresses the impor-
tance of evaluation as a means of learning in addition to evaluation as an accountability 
mechanism (see also, e.g., Van der Meer & Edelenbos, 2006). However, it recognizes that, 
inter alia, methodological problems hamper this learning potential. One of the prob-
lems is the difficulty of isolating the cause of an outcome. Given this difficulty, a related 
problem is how lessons from evaluations can be transferred to other (future) projects. 
One promising methodological approach for dealing with these problems is qualitative 
comparative analysis or QCA (cf. Stern et al., 2012). This is addressed in the second and 
third chapters of this thesis.

In Dutch: Kennisinstituut voor Mobiliteitsbeleid. The KiM is an autonomous part of the Ministry of I&M. It 
is responsible for analyzing developments in the field of mobility so as to improve Dutch transport policies. 
In its organizational work program, the KiM explicitly positions itself as an embodiment of evidence-​
based policy (KiM, 2013). Basically, this is the idea that policy should be based on evidence produced 
by (evaluation) research (e.g., Bakker, 2012). Hence, the KiM also concerns itself with the evaluation of 
transportation infrastructure projects.

Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
This succinct background overview was not intended as a full-fledged, all-encom-
passing account of the policy debate in the Netherlands regarding the development of 
infrastructure projects. If that would have been the intention, the overview presented here 
would fall short. Rather, the intent of Section 1.2 was to provide the background against 
which the present research was conducted and which motivated this thesis. Improving 
the development processes of transportation infrastructure projects is a persistent and 
pressing topic. The Betuweroute and HSL-South projects are closed chapters,24 but the 
transportation infrastructure story continues as new projects are writing history and, by 
the looks of it, on rather black pages. A project that currently exercises many minds is, for 
example, the abovementioned Amsterdam Metro North-South Line (e.g., Badcock, 2009), 
of which the costs have already increased from € 1.4 billion to € 3.1 billion and of which 
the completion time has been postponed from 2011 to 2017 (Soetenhorst, 2011). But it is 
no use crying over spilled milk, and solutions are sought by policy- and decision-makers 
to improve the development processes of transportation infrastructure projects (e.g., Arts, 
Dicke, & Hancher, 2010). This brings us to the question of how this thesis contributes to 
that hankering (Sections 1.3 to 1.5).
1.3.	
Research question and outline of the thesis
This thesis aims to contribute to improving the management of implementation processes 
of PPP infrastructure projects by evaluating these processes.
To this aim, it examines how qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) facilitates learn-
ing from evaluation. This examination consists of assessing QCA as a complexity-informed 
evaluation approach, and applying it to the study of the management of implementation 
processes of PPP infrastructure projects.
Given the background of this thesis as articulated in the previous section, it studies the 
management of the implementations of PPP transportation infrastructure projects in the 
Netherlands as a specific case of such processes. The main research question is as follows.
How can the implementation and management of PPP infrastructure projects be understood 
and evaluated from a complexity perspective using QCA, what management responses in project 
implementation yield (un)satisfactory outcomes, and how can this be explained?
This research question is broken down into a number of steps, formulated as sub-questions 
(SQ). The building blocks to answering the questions are provided throughout this thesis, 
as can be seen in Table 1.1.
24	
As far as construction is concerned (see Gerrits & Marks, 2014).

Part 1  |  Introduction

1.	 How can the implementation and management of implementation of PPP infrastruc-
ture projects be understood from a complexity perspective?
2.	 What then are the consequent methodological requisites for evaluating PPP infrastruc-
ture projects?
3.	 How and to what extent does qualitative comparative analysis fulfill these requisites?
4.	 How are PPP infrastructure project implementations managed empirically, and what 
management responses yield (un)satisfactory outcomes?
5.	 How can these outcomes be explained?
This thesis consists of five parts. Part 1 is this introductory chapter. Part 2 is about ontol-
ogy, epistemology, and methodology. It is concentrated on the first three sub-questions. 
Parts 3 and 4 are primarily empirical; they address the fourth and fifth sub-questions. Part 
5 concerns the conclusions and discussion of the study.
The first sub-question considers how implementation processes of infrastructure 
projects, and their management, can be understood from a complexity perspective. The 
answer to this question is constructed in three ‘steps’ with an increasing focus. At the 
basis lies, first, a philosophical examination of the very nature of reality and how it can 
be understood, including questions of epistemology. This is addressed in the first part of 
Chapter 2 (Gerrits & Verweij, 2013). Second, this understanding of reality is focused on 
infrastructure project development specifically. This is done in the first part of Chapter 3

Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
(Verweij & Gerrits, 2013).25 Third, it is further focused on the management of the imple-
mentation processes of PPP infrastructure projects. This means that the focus is on public 
and private management as responding to unforeseen events. This is done in the first parts 
of the empirical chapters of this thesis (Chapters 4, 5, and 6).
With the second sub-question, the focus shifts from ontology and epistemology to 
methodology. It considers how the complexity perspective developed with the first sub-
question translates into methodological requisites. These requisites are established in the 
second part of Chapter 3.
With the third sub-question, it is assessed to what extent QCA meets these requisites. 
This is done in the final parts of Chapters 2 and 3, but especially Chapter 3. In effect, this 
establishes QCA as a complexity-informed evaluation approach.
The chapters in Part 2 about the first three sub-questions are formative for the ensu-
ing empirical chapters: QCA as a complexity-informed evaluation approach is applied in 
empirical studies. These empirical studies comprise Parts 3 and 4 of this thesis, and they 
address the last two sub-questions.
The fourth sub-question addresses how implementation processes of PPP infrastructure 
projects are managed empirically, and what management responses yield (un)satisfactory 
outcomes. To answer this question, two project implementation processes are studied. The 
first one is the A2 Maastricht, which is analyzed in Chapter 4 (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015).26 
A total of eighteen unforeseen events are identified and comparatively analyzed with QCA. 
The analysis is structured in three steps: it shows the implementation of the infrastruc-
ture project (i.e., the occurrence of unforeseen events), how it is managed (i.e., how the 
events are responded to), and it evaluates what management responses yield satisfactory 
outcomes.27 The second project implementation is the A15 MaVa, which is analyzed in 
Chapter 5 (Verweij, 2015a).28 A total of twenty events are identified and comparatively 
analyzed with QCA. The structure of the chapter is similar to the previous one.29
The comparative analyses with QCA in Chapters 4 and 5 produce patterns of manage-
ment responses to events in implementation processes associated with (un)satisfactory 
outcomes. The fifth sub-question addresses how these patterns associated with outcomes 
can be explained. The answer to this question is constructed in two steps. First, the pat-
terns within the two project implementations are explained by reference to the underlying 
empirical data, for each project respectively. This is done in the final parts of Chapters 4

An earlier version of the article was published as a book chapter in Gerrits and Marks (2012); see Verweij

A previous version of the article was published as a book chapter in Meek and Marshall (2014); see Verweij

and 5. Second, the patterns are explained by comparing the two project implementations 
with each other. This is done in Chapter 6.
Chapter 7 is the empirical capstone of this thesis.30 It comprises Part 4 and it addresses 
both the fourth and fifth sub-questions. It is a comparison of the implementations of a 
medium number of infrastructure projects. The chapter is an attempt to evaluate to what 
extent the patterns and explanations found in Chapters 4 to 6 are generalizable to a larger 
set of implementations. The shift from the studies of the two project implementations, via 
a comparison of them, towards a comparison of a medium number of implementations, 
can be imagined as a T-structure: the ‘leg’ of the T represents the two implementation 
studies and the ‘roof’ represents the comparison of multiple implementations (cf. Buijs 
et al., 2009). In the final chapter (Chapter 8), the research questions are answered. The 
outline of the thesis is summarized in Table 1.1.31
Now that the research questions and thesis outline have been presented, the next 
sections articulate the relevance of the questions and position the thesis in the literature.
1.4.	
Practical relevance to the field
This doctoral thesis intends, first, to cater to the people who are in the business of actually 
implementing PPP infrastructure projects: the project managers (see also Sections 1.5.3 and 
1.5.4).32 Public procurers of infrastructure projects devote a lot of attention and resources 
to planning the projects: the pre-contract phase. The planning phase usually includes the 
legal planning procedures (i.e., Route Decision and zoning plan procedures)33 and the 
procurement and contracting of the project. Subsequently, in contemporary projects, the 
private contractors design, build – and in the case of DBFM, also maintain and (partly) 
finance – the infrastructure. Rijkswaterstaat, the major public procurer of transportation 
infrastructure in the Netherlands,34 is a case in point: it aspires to be a professional public 
principal that leaves the actual design and construction of projects to the market (Rijk-
swaterstaat, 2004; 2008) and, to an increasing degree, also their finance and maintenance 
(e.g., Eversdijk et al., 2011). Hence, quite a few Ph.D. theses have been concluded recently 
that focus on the planning phases – i.e., legal planning, procurement, and contracting – of

Rijkswaterstaat is the executive agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment that 
is responsible for the main transportation network. Rijkswaterstaat employs around 9,000 people and has 
an annual turnover of approximately € 5 billion. It manages over 4,500 km of highways, nearly 2,800 
viaducts, 23 tunnels, and nearly 750 bridges (Rijkswaterstaat, 2012; 2013a).

27
Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
Dutch infrastructure projects, and how these project phases can be improved and utilized 
for improving the end results of projects (e.g., Busscher, 2014; Giezen, 2012; Hoezen, 
2012; Lenferink, 2013; Lousberg, 2012; Verhees, 2013). What happens in the subsequent 
implementation phase of construction and delivery – ‘when the shovel hits the ground’, 
so to say – of infrastructure projects is, however, less researched. Importantly though, it 
is not less important (e.g., Smits, 2013). Events occur in the implementation processes of 
projects, many of which are unforeseen and unplanned, that do have an influence on the 
development and outcomes in/of projects. Recall that this was also recognized by the Tem-
porary Committee on Infrastructure Projects (2004b). Importantly, if these events are not 
managed properly, the obtained or anticipated gains in the legal planning, procurement, 
and contracting phases might be lost in the implementation phase (Mistarihi, Al Refai, 
Al Qaid, & Qeed, 2012).35 Pressman and Wildavsky ([1973]1984) already showed some 
forty years ago that expectations and intentions in planning can easily fail in subsequent 
implementation processes.
Importantly, such unforeseen events are not necessarily due to ignorance on the part 
of some manager or organization bearing responsibility. Project implementation processes 
are ‘wicked’: their systemic complexity means that causes of and solutions for outcomes 
in/of projects cannot be predicted and identified unambiguously (Rittel & Webber, 1973). 
Assuming otherwise would probably facilitate blaming: ‘you should have known then 
that…’ (cf. McDaniel, Jordan, & Fleeman, 2003). In the context of infrastructure project 
implementation specifically, ‘blaming’ translates into public principals and private con-
tractors arguing over who bears responsibility, and the costs that come with this respon-
sibility. Rather, as is explained later in this thesis, unforeseen events are also fundamental 
to the nature of implementing infrastructure projects, and to reality in general (e.g., 
McDaniel & Driebe, 2005a). If we accept this, the focus shifts to how events in project 
implementation are best responded to by their managers, and what can be learned from 
this (cf. McDaniel et al., 2003), or perhaps even how they can be seized as opportuni-
ties (cf. Ward & Chapman, 2003). This concerns, or should concern, public managers 
(and policy- and decision-makers) who – although many risks in project construction 
and delivery are transferred to their private partner, and although such events cannot 
always be prevented – bear some responsibility for the public funds spent on infrastructure 
projects (cf. Miller & Lambert, 2014). This thesis contributes in showing how unforeseen 
events are best responded to (Piperca & Floricel, 2012) in the implementation of PPP 
infrastructure projects (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6).
Second, this thesis intends to cater to evaluators (see also Sections 1.5.1 and 1.5.2) of 
infrastructure projects. Evaluation is important: “the promise that comes from determining 
what works and what does not prompts you to continuously improve” (Kaufman, Keller, 
& Watkins, 1996:8). It is important to stress this promise, because the threat of evaluation, 
“which flows from misuse, comes from the fear that [evaluation] will be used for blaming 
and not for fixing or learning” (Kaufman et al., 1996:8). This thesis wants to emphasize the 
35	
Somewhat related to this, note that the WRR and the Advisory Committee VBI also pointed to problem-
atic management issues (see Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2).

Part 1  |  Introduction
28
promise and not the threat of evaluating projects (cf. Lehtonen, 2014): learning and not 
blaming. Fortunately, this awareness seems to gain a foothold in the Netherlands. Evaluation 
practice in the Netherlands appears to be increasing (Leeuw, 2009) and there is a grow-
ing awareness of the importance of evidence (produced by, inter alia, evaluations) based 
policy (e.g., Bakker, 2012; Hoorens & Oortwijn, 2005). However, concerns are expressed 
with regard to the extent to which results of evaluations actually are, and can be, harnessed 
(Kerseboom, 2008). One of the reasons for this concern, it is argued in the present thesis 
(see especially Chapter 3), is that the results of evaluations hardly reflect the complex nature 
of the object of the evaluation (in this thesis: the management of PPP infrastructure project 
implementation processes). The object of evaluation is also coined the evaluand (Davidson, 
2005). The problem, or at least part of it (cf. Kerseboom, 2008), is in the methodology used 
for the evaluation (Pattyn & Verweij, 2014). In its report (2009), the KiM indeed recognized 
that causality in the real world of transport infrastructure is more complex than is usually 
assumed with conventional evaluation methods. This is correct.
Obviously, it is not possible to provide a complete description of reality: any research 
works with compressions or models of reality (Cilliers, 2000a; 2000b; 2001; 2002; 2005b). 
However, when evaluations compress the complex reality to the point that we are fooled 
by ostensibly clear-cut relations between cause and outcome, it may be disappointing to 
find out that when such ‘causes’ are applied in or to other (future) projects to achieve 
certain outcomes (learning), the outcomes that are actually produced are not those that 
were expected based on the results of the evaluations. The reason, of course, is that the 
actual causal relations are more complex than was assumed with the methods used in the 
evaluation (cf. Rogers, 2011). Byrne (1998:37; Byrne & Callaghan, 2013:58) has eloquently 
and trenchantly stated that “positivism is dead. By now it has gone off and is beginning 
to smell.” The implication of this observation could be that as much of the complexity of 
the evaluand needs to be preserved as possible. However, in extremis, this would result 
in some postmodernist evaluative account (cf. Abma, 1996) that cannot be used in other 
(future) projects because generalization is not allowed. Both alternatives, i.e., excessive 
compression and generalization versus the excessive absence of it, are problematic for 
learning from evaluations (cf. Marsden & Stead, 2011). Excessive compression results in 
oversimplified evaluation results that may not work in other (future) projects, and the 
absence of compression forbids generalization, which forecloses in advance the option of 
cross-project learning. There is a need for broadening the range of evaluation methods in 
the toolbox (Stern et al., 2012). This thesis establishes and applies QCA as a complexity-
informed evaluation approach that overcomes the flaws of both extreme positions by 
striking a balance between them (see Chapters 2 and 3), so that learning from evaluation 
is facilitated.
This thesis’ envisaged contribution to evaluators is combined with the intention to cater 
to the project managers. This is done by applying QCA to the evaluation of how unforeseen 
events in implementation processes of PPP infrastructure projects are best responded to by 
managers (see Chapters 4 and 5). Having articulated the practical relevance of this thesis to 
the field, the next section is concerned with how it caters to the academic enterprise.

Scientific positioning and relevance to the 
literature
This thesis is imbued with complexity theory, or rather (see Byrne & Callaghan, 2013) 
‘complexity’, ‘complexity science’, or ‘complexity thinking’. The purpose of this thesis is 
not to provide a comprehensive overview of the origins and strands of complexity. Such 
overviews have already been produced by others (see, e.g., Castellani, 2014). Very briefly, 
complexity has been strongly influenced by developments in the natural sciences (i.e., 
biology, physics, and chemistry), often in interplay with mathematics and informatics 
(see, e.g., Mitchell, 2009), it is trans-disciplinary (Simon, 1962), and applications and 
developments are widespread throughout the sciences of both the physical and the social 
(see, e.g., Castellani, 2014). The latter includes the fields of Public Administration,36 Public 
Policy, and Public Management, which have seen many complexity-informed scientific 
articles (too many to list here), books (Colander & Kupers, 2014; Dennard, Richardson, & 
Morçöl, 2008; Gerrits & Marks, 2012; Gerrits, 2012; Geyer & Rihani, 2010; Haynes, 2003; 
Meek & Marshall, 2014; Morçöl, 2012; Rhodes, Murphy, Muir, & Murray, 2011; Room, 
2011; Teisman, 2005; Teisman, Van Buuren, & Gerrits, 2009), special issues (Dennard, 
Richardson, & Morçöl, 2005; Landini & Occelli, 2012; Meek, 2010; 2014; Morçöl, 2008; 
Teisman & Klijn, 2008), and recently even dedicated journals (Hadžikadić, 2014; Morçöl, 
Teisman, & Gerrits, 2014).37 Given the breadth of the disciplines in which it occurs, it 
can hardly be maintained that complexity is a coherent agreed upon causal framework of 
propositions across (and even within) the academic disciplines in which it is being applied 
and developed. Hence, following Byrne and Callaghan, in this thesis the position is taken 
that complexity “is an ontologically founded framework for understanding and not a 
theory of causation” (2013:8). This said, the present thesis has been shaped by complexity’s 
understanding of reality and the epistemological derivatives thereof.
This section positions the thesis briefly in the scientific fields of complexity (Section 
1.5.1), evaluation (Section 1.5.2), project management (Section 1.5.3), and PPP infrastruc-
ture projects (Section 1.5.4), and it articulates the contributions it intends to make to those 
fields.
1.5.1.	
Complexity and qualitative comparative analysis
Buijs, Eshuis, and Byrne (2009), amongst many, explain that complex systems have unique 
aspects but, because systems are open and therefore interact with each other, that they also 
share characteristics with other complex systems. Another way to put this is that reality 
is complex and rich in detail, but that general patterns can be found in it as well. This 
observation can be traced back to complexity’s hallmark that life/reality/a phenomenon 
emerges from the interactions between a seemingly infinite number of elements (Gribbin, 
36

Complexity is also being taken up in the public domain beyond academia (e.g., OECD Global Science 
Forum, 2009).

2004; Mitchell, 2009; Waldrop, 1992). A necessary precondition for understanding social 
phenomena, such as the implementation processes of PPP infrastructure projects that are 
studied in this thesis, thus is studying the details (Hertogh & Westerveld, 2010). Case 
studies are an appropriate means to study cases in detail – to study how elements interact 
in complex ways – to produce the outcome of interest (Anderson, Crabtree, Steele, & 
McDaniel, 2005; Buijs et al., 2009). Case studies focus on in-depth causal explanation of 
cases by using qualitative methods and techniques. The limitation is, however, that pat-
terns found are unlikely to be representative or generalizable (Sayer, 1992).38 This was also 
observed by Pollitt (2009) who argued, in response to a collection of complexity-informed 
case studies of infrastructure projects (Teisman et al., 2009), that “it is questionable 
whether even a substantial number of individual case studies can convincingly be used 
to derive general patterns” (2009:224), and who hence suggested to “explore more fully 
methodologies beyond that of case studies” (2009:230). This exploration is initiated in 
this thesis.
QCA is put forward as a promising approach that allows the derivation of general 
patterns from case studies in a systematic and transparent way. Merely introducing QCA 
is not the intended contribution of this thesis. The approach has been around for a while 
(Ragin, 1987; 2000; 2008a), textbooks have been written about it (Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a; 
Schneider & Wagemann, 2007; 2012),39 and it has been applied many times already (Marx, 
Rihoux, & Ragin, 2014; Rihoux, Álamos-Concha, Bol, Marx, & Rezsöhazy, 2013). Rather, 
this thesis’ intention is to – building on the work of most notably David Byrne (2002; 
2005; 2009; 2011a; 2011b) – assess, establish, and apply QCA as a complexity-informed 
research approach. The links between complexity as an ontological and epistemological 
frame of reference, and QCA as its methodological ‘corollary’, will be explicated. This is 
at the center stage of Chapters 2 and 3. The perspective established in those chapters is 
formative for the subsequent empirical research that is reported in this thesis.
1.5.2.	
Evaluation and qualitative comparative analysis
QCA is rapidly gaining in popularity in the disciplines of Public Administration and 
Policy Analysis (Rihoux, Rezsöhazy, & Bol, 2011; Rihoux et al., 2013). The same applies 
to the Evaluation discipline.40 Using the bibliographical database Scopus to conduct an 
exploratory survey in evaluation journals,41 it was found that the recent years have seen 
38	
In contrast to intensive research approaches such as case studies, ‘extensive’ approaches focus on descrip-
tive, representative generalizations by applying quantitative methods and techniques, with the limitation, 
though, that the explanatory power of the results is limited (Sayer, 1992).

Other QCA-​related books are: Rihoux and Grimm (2006b), Fiss, Cambré, and Marx (2013), and Thiem 
and Duşa (2013c).

The Scopus Journal Analyzer was used to select the relevant evaluation journals, using the query ‘evalu-
ation’. The resultant selection of 19 evaluation journals was searched with the queries ‘ALL(*qca)’ or 
‘ALL(“qualitative comparative analysis”)’ to ensure that all articles that mentioned QCA were found. This 
resulted in a total number of 26 articles of which 19 actually mentioned QCA (in other articles, QCA was 

31

a strong increase of QCA-related publications (see also Gerrits & Verweij, Accepted). 
An increasing number of conceptual pieces is being published (Byrne, 2013; Verweij & 
Gerrits, 2013), often including empirical applications as well (Balthasar, 2006; Befani et 
al., 2007; Befani, 2013; Blackman, Wistow, & Byrne, 2013; Holvoet & Dewachter, 2013; 
Ledermann, 2012; Pattyn, 2014; Sager & Andereggen, 2012; Thiem, 2014).42 QCA has also 
been recognized as a relevant evaluation approach outside the evaluation journals (e.g., 
Befani & Sager, 2006; Hudson & Kühner, 2013; Marx, 2005; Pattyn & Verweij, 2014; 
Varone, Rihoux, & Marx, 2006; Verweij & Gerrits, 2012a).43 This raises the question: what 
is the contribution of the present thesis to the evaluation literature?
First, QCA is introduced as a complexity-informed approach – i.e., a method explic-
itly rooted in the ontology and epistemology of complexity – into the evaluation discipline 
(Chapter 3). As Walton’s (2014) lately published literature review shows, complexity is 
increasingly discussed and applied in the evaluation literature. The attention given to 
complexity in the journal Evaluation, for instance, has grown in recent years (e.g., Barnes, 
Matka, & Sullivan, 2003; Byrne, 2013; Callaghan, 2008; Davies, 2004; Mowles, 2014; 
Rogers, 2008; Sanderson, 2000; Verweij & Gerrits, 2013; Westhorp, 2012). There are also 
an increasing number of books available about complexity and evaluation (e.g., Forss, 
Marra, & Schwartz, 2011; Patton, 2011; Wolf-Branigin, 2013). To this field of complexity 
and evaluation, the present thesis adds QCA (cf. Blackman et al., 2013; Byrne, 2013), 
stressing in particular how QCA can also be deployed in a grounded manner. QCA is 
often said to be theory-driven (cf. Amenta & Poulsen, 1994; Befani et al., 2007; Yamasaki 
& Rihoux, 2009). In this thesis it is argued that, and explained how, QCA – consistent 
with complexity and specifically the notion that the subjectivity of agents in systems is 
formative to the evaluand, i.e., that managers’ experiences have a key-role in understand-
ing infrastructure project implementation processes (cf. Verweij, 2012a) – is to be applied 
in a more grounded fashion (cf. Hicks, 1994; Rantala & Hellström, 2001).44
Second, as explained by Lehtonen (2014), the evaluation of infrastructure projects 
has gained attention, but mainly for reasons of improving accountability and not for 
learning. The reason is that it mainly focuses on the ‘pathologies’ – i.e., outcomes – of, 
inter alia, costs overruns, time delays, and infrastructure quality (cf. Atkinson, 1999). It 
has been preoccupied with comparing ‘before and after’ situations. Although important 
an abbreviation for something else). This exploratory survey was last conducted on the 20th of October 
2014 and includes all articles up to that date.
42	
Other articles referenced to QCA, recognizing its relevance for evaluation, but did not pursue a detailed 
discussion of QCA (Da Costa, Pegado, Ávila, & Coelho, 2013; Jackson & Kolla, 2012; Pattyn & Brans, 
2013; Ton, 2012; Walton, 2014; Yin, 2013).

This does not mean that theory has no role to play. Rather, induction – understood as “the process of 
using evidence to formulate or reformulate a general idea” – and deduction – understood as “the process of 
deriving more specific ideas or propositions from general ideas” – are in interplay with each other (Ragin 
& Amoroso, 2011:​76). They often blend in the research process, although this is often hard to exhibit in 
the reporting of the research. Cases are constructed in the research process, where data as well as theory 
(evidence as well as ideas) are used in a dialogical, iterative fashion for the purpose of achieving closure 
between them (Ragin, 1992).

Part 1  |  Introduction
32
(cf. Short & Kopp, 2005), the drawback of this is that less insight is gained in how the 
‘after’ was produced in-between, in the implementation processes of the projects (cf. 
Love, Smith, Simpson, Regan, & Olatunji, OnlineFirst). This gap between implementa-
tion and evaluation limits the contribution of evaluations for learning (see, e.g., Patton, 
2011). Alternatively, this thesis intends to show that QCA, when applied as a complexity-
informed evaluation approach, focuses attention on learning from evaluations, because it 
gives attention to human experiences in understanding outcomes and the ways in which 
these are produced in projects. Specifically, it recognizes, first, the importance of context 
and the existence of multiple perspectives and rationalities (cf. Lehtonen, 2014), such 
as those of public managers, private managers, and local stakeholders. Second, it recog-
nizes the importance of the day-to-day, the real-life, and the here-and-now practice of 
managing the projects in their uncertain and unpredictable environments (cf. Lehtonen, 
2014; Sanderson, 2012). By evaluating the ‘in-between’ instead of the ‘before and after’ 
of projects, this thesis intends to contribute to closing the gap between the evaluation 
and the implementation (cf. Pressman & Wildavsky, [1973]1984) of infrastructure projects 
(Lehtonen, 2014). It is argued that, and showed how, QCA as a complexity-informed and 
systematic evaluation approach can be used to this purpose (Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 7). In 
doing so, QCA is also introduced in the field of (PPP) infrastructure project research (cf. 
Jordan, Gross, Javernick-Will, & Garvin, 2011), a domain rather unfamiliar with QCA 
(Jordan et al., 2011) with the exception of a few applications (e.g., Chan & Levitt, 2011; 
Delhi, Mahalingam, & Palukuri, 2012; Gross & Garvin, 2011).
1.5.3.	
Project management and infrastructure projects
Complexity science understands that reality is composed of open systems that are nested 
and interrelated (Byrne, 2005). Hence, project implementations are open systems em-
bedded in open socio-physical systems (i.e., environments) with which they interact 
(Engwall, 2003). The complex nature of the system creates uncertainties and it gives rise 
to unforeseen events (cf. Söderholm, 2008). Although it is still insufficiently appreciated, 
this requires project management research to adopt a situational, contextual approach 
(Blomquist, Hällgren, Nilsson, & Söderholm, 2010; Hertogh & Westerveld, 2010). As 
Sanderson expresses it (2012:441):
“If we admit the view that the future unfolds in unknowable ways through myriad 
decisions and interactions between autonomous actors, then we must give proper 
attention to the ways in which project governing happens in a situated, relational 
sense, rather than focusing solely on governance as a set of pre-designed objects.”
This thesis follows that view by focusing on how implementation managers of PPP infra-
structure projects respond to situated unforeseen events (Chapters 4, 5, and 6).
The difference between risk and uncertainty is important here. As Sanderson (2012) 
explains, if managers adopt a risk-perspective then they assign probabilities – based on 

33
Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
either mathematical chance, or past empirical/statistical data – to events. If they adopt an 
uncertainty-perspective, then they accept that no objective probabilities can be assigned 
to a known range of possible future events, or that the range of possible future events is 
unknowable in the first place (cf. Flood, 1999a; 1999b). The risk-perspective dominates 
the literature on, and the practice of, the management of infrastructure projects (see, e.g., 
Akintoye & MacLeod, 1997; Smith, Merna, & Jobling, 2014). Importantly, as Sanderson 
(2012) clarifies, a focus on the risk-perspective seeks explanations for the outcomes in/of 
projects in the strategic rent-seeking behavior of project stakeholders, because the perspec-
tive assumes a worldview where the implementation paths of infrastructure projects can be 
calculated and that, therefore, actors can choose to miscalculate. This view is adopted in, 
inter alia, the work of Flyvbjerg and colleagues (e.g., Flyvbjerg et al., 2002; Flyvbjerg et al., 
2003; Flyvbjerg, Skamris Holm, & Buhl, 2005; Flyvbjerg, 2009a). It focuses on identifying 
culprits and holding them accountable. This is not a perspective that promotes learning 
from evaluating the implementation of infrastructure projects (cf. Lehtonen, 2014; Love 
et al., OnlineFirst; Van der Meer & Edelenbos, 2006). The uncertainty perspective, on the 
other hand, accepts that events can be unforeseen (Sanderson, 2012). The occurrence of 
such events directly derives from reality composed of complex systems (McDaniel et al., 
2003; McDaniel & Driebe, 2005b). March mentions “inherently unpredictable worlds” 
(1994:36), and McDaniel and colleagues refer to, inter alia, “the basic dynamics of complex 
adaptive systems” (2003:267), and the “fundamental unpredictability for the trajectory of 
the system and, therefore, fundamental unknowability of future system states” (2003:269). 
Adopting this view means dismissing the view that unforeseen events are due to ignorance 
or rent-seeking behavior (cf. Verweij, Van Meerkerk, & Korthagen, 2015), and accepting 
that unforeseen events inevitably occur. This shifts the focus to learning from both better 
and worse experiences with responding to events in implementation (McDaniel et al., 
2003). In fact, as the review by Müller-Seitz and Schüßler (2013) indicates, the literature 
on unexpected events focuses on learning from events (e.g., McDaniel et al., 2003; Weick 
& Sutcliffe, 2001; 2007). This thesis investigates how these events are best responded to 
and, in doing so, contributes to the need to develop more complexity-informed, ‘bottom-
up’ understandings of, and approaches to, the research and practice of managing projects 
(Blomquist et al., 2010; Winter, Smith, Morris, & Cicmil, 2006).
1.5.4.	
Public-private partnerships and infrastructure projects
The fourth and final field to which this thesis intends to contribute is PPPs in infrastruc-
ture projects. Cross-sector partnerships in projects have become more prominent from 
the 1980s onwards, as it was increasingly recognized that organizations have by themselves 
insufficient capacities to deal with increasingly uncertain environments (Selsky & Parker, 
2005). Business-government partnerships, i.e., public-private partnerships, constitute one 
arena (Selsky & Parker, 2005). PPPs have been contested ever since they became fashion-
able some thirty-five years ago (Bovaird, 2004) – inter alia because of their questionable 
performance (e.g., Hodge & Greve, 2007; 2009)  –  but they have become a prevalent 

Part 1  |  Introduction
34
practice nonetheless (Bovaird, 2004), as they are expected to have many advantages over 
classical ways of public infrastructure procurement (see, e.g., Section 1.2.2). PPP popular-
ity also increased in the field of delivering (transportation) infrastructure projects (Kwak, 
Chih, & Ibbs, 2009), including in the Netherlands (Klijn, 2009) (see Section 1.2.2). This 
growing popularity is also reflected in the increasing number of PPP articles published in 
this field (Ke, Wang, Chan, & Cheung, 2009; Tang, Shen, & Cheng, 2010).
Literature reviews of infrastructure project PPP studies indicate that PPP risks is one 
of the dominant topics in the academic literature (Ke et al., 2009; Kwak et al., 2009; 
Tang et al., 2010). Many studies have been conducted, for instance, into the preferred 
allocation of risks and responsibilities between the public and private partners (e.g., Bing, 
Akintoye, Edwards, & Hardcastle, 2005; Chung, Hensher, & Rose, 2010; Hwang, Zhao, 
& Gay, 2013; Ibrahim, Price, & Dainty, 2006; Ke, Wang, Chan, & Lam, 2010; Ng & 
Loosemore, 2007; Roumboutsos & Anagnostopoulos, 2008). A topic that has received 
less attention is the management in PPP infrastructure projects (cf. Ismail, 2011; Ke et 
al., 2009). Research that has been performed into the management in and of PPPs (e.g., 
Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008; Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Klijn, Edelenbos, Kort, & Van 
Twist, 2006; 2008), however, has not (always) specifically focused on the implementation 
processes of the projects. What happens in the implementation of a PPP project – i.e., 
the construction and delivery which start after the phases of legal planning, procurement, 
and contracting have been concluded – is generally little studied (Jones & Noble, 2008; 
Mistarihi et al., 2012; Mistarihi, Hutchings, & Shacklock, 2013; Weihe, 2008b; 2009) (see 
also Section 1.4).
PPP implementation is an important topic because, if not managed correctly, the 
obtained or anticipated gains in the formation of PPPs might be lost in the implementa-
tion phase (cf. Verweij et al., 2015). The literature about PPP risks focuses on ‘designing’ 
PPPs and allocating risks to partners based thereon (e.g., Reijniers, 1994). However, when 
the implementation starts, unforeseen events can still occur (see Section 1.5.3) and both 
the public and the private partners have a vested interest in an effective management of 
these events. The market needs to make a profit and the government serves to protect 
a wide variety of public interests. It is argued however, referring to the work of Jacobs 
(1992), that the fundamental differences between the public and private domains – in 
terms of these interests, but also with respect to perspectives, management practices, 
etcetera – poses great difficulties in the planning and in the implementation processes of 
PPP projects (Klijn & Teisman, 2000b; 2003; 2005; Koppenjan, 2005; Reynaers, 2014; 
Teisman, 2010; Van Ham & Koppenjan, 2001; Verweij, 2012a). A focus on risks means 
trying to solve implementation problems by reference to the risk allocations stipulated in 
the PPP contract. Although contracts are of great importance to successful PPP project 
implementation, a too strict focus on them could result in disputes about who is to be 
held accountable (‘blaming’), which, as studies (Kumaraswamy & Zhang, 2001 cited in: 
Tang, Shen, & Cheng 2010) and recent experiences (e.g., Koppenjan & Leijten, 2005a; 
2005b; 2007) suggest, often results in the government bearing the costs. Rather, this thesis 
(Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7) contributes by focusing on how public and private managers need 

35
Chapter 1  |  The complexity of PPP infrastructure projects
to work in partnership to achieve satisfactory outcomes in implementation processes, a 
topic that is yet rather understudied (Weihe, 2009).
In summation, establishing (Chapters 2 and 3) and applying (Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 
7) QCA as a complexity-informed evaluation approach, this thesis thus combines the 
PPP and project management research fields with that of the evaluation of infrastructure 
projects, by evaluating how implementation processes of PPP infrastructure projects can 
be managed satisfactorily, and explicating what can be learnt from this (Chapter 8).
1.6.	
Final remarks
Qualitative, case-based research is often not a purely inductive or deductive process. The 
same applies to the present thesis, which is best characterized as iterative (cf. Dubois 
& Gadde, 2002; Ragin, 1992; Ragin & Amoroso, 2011; Schwartz-Shea & Yanow, 2012). 
The arguments introduced above, the research questions, the conduct of the research, 
the report of the research in this book, the conclusions  –  these have all been shaped 
throughout the research process. It is important to stress this because this thesis is article-
based. This means that some of the articles (i.e., Chapters 2 to 7) were published or 
accepted for publication – ‘cast in stone’, so to speak – after which (further) empirical 
research was conducted, resulting in new ideas and insights. Although they were ‘cast in 
stone’, the articles should not be understood as rigid frameworks for the subsequent steps 
in the research (cf. Robson, 2002). This thesis represents the ongoing development of 
the thinking about the topics introduced above, to date, and an attempt to report on the 
research into these topics.


PArt 2
Ontology, epistemology, and Methodology
Th is part of the thesis focuses on the fi rst three sub-questions. it examines how implementa-
tion processes and their management of PPP infrastructure projects can be understood from 
a complexity perspective (i.e., the fi rst sub-question), what this implies for evaluating these 
processes in terms of methodological requisites (i.e., the second sub-question), and to what ex-
tent qualitative comparative analysis (QcA) meets these requisites (i.e., the third sub-question).
QcA is fi rst established as a complexity-informed approach. Th is is done in chapter 2 by 
making the connection between complexity as an “ontologically founded framework for 
understanding” (Byrne & callaghan, 2013:8) and QcA. it is important to explicitly consider 
this relationship:
“‘Method’ suggests a carefully considered way of approaching the world so that we 
may understand it better. to make judgments about method it helps considerably if 
we have some idea of the nature of the relationship between ourselves and that which 
we seek to understand. Yet it is at this fundamental level that many arguments about 
method go wrong, for they fail to consider knowledge in its context” (Sayer, 1992:12).
Th e connection between complexity and QcA is established by using critical realism as a meta-
framework. Th e chapter is published as an article in the Journal of Critical Realism (Gerrits & 
verweij, 2013).
in chapter 3 the relationship between complexity and QcA is also established, but now with 
a specifi c focus on the evaluation of infrastructure project development processes. it is argued 
that project implementation is complex, which imposes requirements on the methodology that 
can be used for evaluating infrastructure projects (see, e.g., Smyth & Morris, 2007), and that 
QcA is a suitable approach for evaluating infrastructure project development processes. Th e 
chapter also provides a fi rst explanation of how QcA works. Th e chapter is published as an 
article in the journal Evaluation (verweij & Gerrits, 2013).
Synchronously with the development of these two chapters, QcA was applied in an empirical 
study of network management in dutch spatial planning governance networks. Th is resulted 
in an article publication in the journal Public Administration (verweij et al., 2013). Although 
that study is not part of this thesis, the experiences gained with it greatly contributed to the 
development of chapters 2 and 3.

Abstract
Many methods are used in research on complexity. One of these is qualitative comparative 
analysis (QCA). Although many authors allude to the relationships between complexity 
and QCA, these links are rarely made explicit. We propose that one way of doing so 
is by using critical realism as a meta-framework. This article discusses the viability of 
this approach by examining the extent to which QCA is a complexity-informed method. 
This question is answered in three steps. First, we discuss the nature of complexity and 
its epistemological implications. Second, we focus on Bhaskar’s perspective on critical 
realism and show how it can be used as a framework for understanding social complexity. 
Third, we examine the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying QCA and 
synthesize these with our critical realist approach to complexity. We argue that complex 
reality is non-decomposable, contingent, non-compressible, and time-asymmetric. We 
conclude that, although QCA is inevitably reductive (i.e., it compresses reality) and partial 
(i.e., it decomposes reality), its core premises are built upon the notions of contingency 
and time-asymmetry. Therefore, it is not only a powerful method for doing complexity-
informed research, but is also a complexity-informed method by itself.

Introduction
Many different methods and tools are being used to carry out social-scientific inquiry 
that is informed by the complexity sciences (Byrne, 1998). Agent-based modelling (e.g., 
Koliba, Zia, & Lee, 2011) and action research-based theory (e.g., Wagenaar, 2006) are just 
two of the many methods of inquiry that are informed by theories and concepts from the 
complexity sciences. Each method or analytical tool used in the complexity sciences has 
a number of implicit or explicit ontological and epistemological assumptions, and these 
assumptions differ greatly across methods. Each method brings with it different assump-
tions about the nature of complexity, differing levels of access to reality, and differing 
explanations for observed phenomena. These differences have led many to ask whether 
there is a method in the mix that is not only helpful in analyzing complexity, but that is 
itself informed by complexity, i.e., a native method or tool.
One such method that has received much attention, most notably from David Byrne 
(Buijs et al., 2009; Byrne, 2005; 2009; 2011a), as being particularly suitable for analyzing 
the complexity of reality, is Charles Ragin’s qualitative comparative analysis or QCA (1987; 
2000; 2008a). The main feature of this case-based method is that it is able to account for the 
contingency of a social phenomenon. In addition (and not instead of doing so), it allows 
for an exploration of causal patterns. As such, it is a viable means by which to understand 
the systemic nature of case studies and to identify recurring patterns across such cases 
(cf. Gerrits, 2012). However, although many authors allude to the relationship between 
complexity and QCA, the logic underlying this relationship is rarely made explicit. This 
article aims to map that relationship using critical realism as a meta-framework.
We argue here that any effort to research social complexity is implicitly or explicitly in-
formed by Roy Bhaskar’s critical realism (cf. Reed & Harvey, 1992). We posit that Bhaskar’s 
view of the world as complex is not simply a truism, but provides a meta-framework for 
understanding reality as complex and systemic. Our discussion on complexity and critical 
realism translates into a specific take on complexity, summarized in four properties, which 
can also be found in QCA, if it is carried out following Byrne and Ragin’s guidelines.
This article is structured as follows. We start with the understanding that complexity 
is a real, non-constructed, property of the world. This leads to a number of epistemo-
logical consequences (Section 2.2.1). We then discuss critical realism as a framework for 
articulating this complex reality (Section 2.2.2). Next, we discuss the basic ontological and 
epistemological assumptions behind QCA (Section 2.3) before relating them to Bhaskar’s 
critical realism. In doing so, we assess the extent to which QCA is complexity-informed 
(Section 2.4). The argument is summarized in the final section (Section 2.5).

Complexity
2.2.1.	 Complex reality
According to many authors on the subject, ontologies in the realm of complexity sci-
ences are different from the classical Newtonian worldview. A non-Newtonian worldview 
holds that reality is characterized by wholes rather than discrete entities and events; non-
linear causality instead of linear causality; uncertainty about the future instead of total 
predictability; and partial truths rather than final truths (Morçöl, 2001). Although these 
statements describe the nature of complexity, they do not specifically answer the ques-
tion: what exactly is complexity? Although there have been many attempts to answer this 
question, complexity has proven to be elusive to define unambiguously (Rescher, 1998). 
A tentative answer could be that complexity is the opposite of simplicity, i.e., complex-
ity focuses on intricate causal patterns that progress non-linearly, making for a poorly 
predictable reality. But this answer is as vague as it is specific. While it points out that 
complexity is recursive, as each closer look reveals even more intricate details that mirror 
the larger whole, complexity is not exactly recursive in the sense that the whole can be fully 
known or understood by looking at the discrete details (Cilliers, 2002; 2005b; Rescher, 
1998). It implies that a truly accurate description of a phenomenon’s complexity would be 
of the same extent as the phenomenon itself (Rescher, 1998). This is impossible for two 
reasons. First, complexity is not static but dynamic; thus, an exhaustive description would 
be temporally limited. Second, there are practical limitations in generating complete and 
dynamic descriptions of reality. Any description or model of complexity is incomplete by 
definition, as pointed out by Paul Cilliers, among others (1998; 2005a). Hence, the ques-
tion becomes: what characteristics of reality impede our understanding and generation of 
knowledge about the real world?
Perhaps the most fundamental statement about complexity that can be made is that 
the world is composed of open systems that are nested within, and have nested within 
themselves, other open systems (Byrne, 2005). This openness means that systems, al-
though bounded, interact with other open systems in their environment (Cilliers, 2001). 
This interaction results in changes to the systems, as environmental influences become 
part of the system’s structure. However, such environmental influences are not magically 
transferred to the system; the components that form the structure of the system interact 
and it is through this interaction that environmental influences become internalized. The 
process by which this happens is referred to as emergence: structure is formed through the 
interaction of components, and the resulting structures are not linearly traceable to their 
roots. Without interaction, there is no structure, only a sum of components. Thus, com-
plex reality consists of open systems that are emergently structured (Reed & Harvey, 1992). 
Note, however, that emergence does not mean that a discrete entity or phenomenon, 
that can be investigated under controlled conditions in the real world, exists (Elder-Vass, 
2005). Instead, emergence serves as an ontological vehicle for thinking about the nature 
of causation.

Chapter 2  |  Complex reality and QCA
Thinking through emergence points towards another important characteristic of 
complexity: time-asymmetry, which implies time-irreversibility. If social reality is a non-
linear emergent result of interacting components, then the future is not a mirror of the 
past. Although the situation at a given time may appear to be the logical consequence 
of the sequence of prior events, that logic is not as easily apparent when predicting the 
future (Byrne, 1998). This is because systems do not follow fixed trajectories. The occur-
rence of non-ergodic chance events means that reality is developmentally open: “causally 
undetermined or underdetermined by the existing realities of the present and open to 
the contingencies of chance or choice” (Rescher, 1995:41). Thus, the future consists of a 
number of possible future states, some more likely than others. Which one of those future 
states becomes the actual state depends on the past, and the occurrence of random or 
chance events. These chance events introduce a level of instability into the trajectories of 
phenomena, and explain why the future is probabilistic even though the past often (falsely) 
appears as a fixed sequence (Prigogine, 1997). In an indeterministic or developmentally 
open world, certain events may or may not happen  –  depending on the conjunction 
of conditions. Some configurations may bring forth a future more probable than others 
(Gerrits, 2012).
These ontological points of departure highlight four properties of reality (Byrne, 
2011a). First, since reality is non-decomposable, simply describing components of real-
ity as discrete entities is insufficient, because real structures and processes come about 
through the internal and external interactions between these components. Second, reality 
is contingent. This means that any explanation is temporal in time and local in place. 
Since systems are nested within their systemic environments, there is mutual influence 
between different systems. This property also implies that some mechanisms are in opera-
tion at given points in time, while others are not, which we expand on in Section 2.2.2. 
Third, the previous two properties mean that reality cannot be compressed without losing 
some of its aspects. In other words, while reduction or compression may be inevitable 
given the limits of human cognition, and for practical research purposes, such a reduction 
or compression implies the loss of some of reality’s properties, such that any explanation is 
reductionist, i.e., an explanation can never fully contain the complexity it describes. This 
is also indicative of the role of semiotics in defining the world in terms of systems. Finally, 
time is understood to be asymmetric, which means that the trajectory of all systems is 
unidirectional. An event may appear in hindsight to be the result of a logical sequence of 
events, but, as mentioned earlier, this logic is not as easily apparent when looking into the 
future. Epistemologically, this constrains the extent to which meaningful predictions can 
be made.
In the next section, we argue that critical realism functions as a meta-framework for 
understanding this complex reality. We also look at the implications of critical realism for 
the type of statements that science can substantiate, and the methods that can be deployed 
to substantiate them.

2.2.2.	 Real complexity
The common theme in arguments about the complexity of social reality is that this reality 
is real. Many authors in the field of complexity science maintain that attempts can be 
made to understand this reality. A realist stance is implied in social complexity that is 
explicitly not postmodernist, but also not modernist, because it argues that reality can 
be understood through the deployment of research tools (Cilliers, 1998). It echoes Kant’s 
stance on empirical realism in holding that there is a reality that exists independently of 
our knowledge and perception (Losch, 2009), but goes beyond Kant in assuming that 
research allows us to approach reality, and that the tools of research actually allow us to 
come closer to reality (Sayer, 1992). This way of thinking is propagated in critical realism, 
and it is often thought of as the way to navigate between empiricism and the interpretive 
sciences (Wuisman, 2005).
There are a number of different and disconnected strands under the heading of criti-
cal realism (Losch, 2009) which may cause some confusion about what critical realism 
actually means. Still, variants have been adopted in many scientific domains (Easton, 
2010). We do not intend to comment directly on that diversity, but to build more specifi-
cally on the early work of Bhaskar ([1975]2008) who is credited with the philosophical 
elaboration of the first wave of critical realism, as well as two subsequent waves (Bhaskar 
& Hartwig, 2010). While we acknowledge that Bhaskar himself, at first, used the term 
‘transcendental’ and not ‘critical’ realism (Losch, 2009), we conform to the nomenclature 
that has developed over time and use the latter as shorthand for Bhaskar’s philosophy and 
strongly related accounts.
Bhaskar’s work indicates the existence of a reality independent from human observa-
tion. In contrast to others who have a similar view, he believes that we can in fact research, 
observe the effects of, and analyze the mechanisms underlying, the occurrence of events. 
Thus, he moves beyond the idea that humans can only describe what they think they 
perceive without claiming to gain better access to the causal mechanisms that are behind 
events, processes, or behavior. In this way, Bhaskar presents a stratified perspective on 
social reality that gives meaning to how one can understand the world. As Andrew Sayer 
puts it, “critical realism distinguishes not only between the world and our experience of it, 
but between the real, the actual and the empirical” (2000:11). The empirical is the domain 
of personal experiences. These are accompanied by the realities of actual events, processes, 
and behavior, and the mechanisms underlying these events and processes of structure and 
power. It is important to note that while these mechanisms exist a priori, particular con-
figurations can bring the mechanisms into action, or fail to do so. A well-known example 
of this is labor power. The power to perform labor is very real, but becomes actualized 
when labor is actually performed (Sayer, 2000). This position has implications for the 
type of statements that science can substantiate, and the methods that can be deployed to 
substantiate them.
In relation to the first point, Bhaskar posits that causality is real and can be researched. 
External events, processes, or behaviors (Bhaskar’s second dimension of stratification), and 

45
Chapter 2  |  Complex reality and QCA
the effects of underlying mechanisms (the third dimension), can be observed (the first 
dimension) as they unfold (Easton, 2010). Critical realism favors the language of causality 
to describe the world, even though it accepts that any analysis of causality is partial at best. 
Therefore, critical realism advocates that it can generate provisional explanation of how 
events follow from previous events, what drives processes, and the mechanisms by which 
human behavior transpires. In the words of Sayer: “To ask for the cause of something is 
to ask ‘what makes it happen’, what ‘produces’, ‘generates’, ‘creates’ or ‘determines’ it, or, 
more weakly, what ‘enables’ or ‘leads to’ it” (Sayer, 1992:104).
Bhaskar accepts that, while the world ticks because of certain mechanisms, it is not 
possible to uncover these mechanisms unambiguously or comprehensively (Cilliers, 2001; 
2002; 2005b). Following Malcolm Williams (2009; 2011), it is on this point that we feel 
that Bhaskar’s critical realism needs to be amended. Critical realism argues that “there 
are often sufficient conditions for something to occur, but they are not necessary ones, 
except under specific circumstances whereby the ‘natural necessity’ is actualized” (Wil-
liams, 2009:3). We follow Sayer in saying that, although “in the ‘open systems’ of the 
social world, the same causal power can produce different outcomes, according to how 
the conditions for closure are broken” and “sometimes, different causal mechanisms can 
produce the same result” (Sayer, 2000:15), this critical realist view of causation is still open 
to natural or nomic necessity (Williams, 2009). However, critical realism in Bhaskar’s view 
holds that it is impossible to know this necessity up to the moment that it is actualized 
(the dimension of the actual): structures and powers are considered dispositional.
Again, labor power provides a striking example. We agree with Bhaskar that recursive 
complexity impairs complete knowledge of the world, but we add that this recursive 
property is not the sole reason for partial knowledge. Indeed, reality is itself contingent, 
and, for that reason, any explanation is partial and contingent. As stated before, some 
mechanisms operate while others do not, and this marks the difference between potential 
and achieved influence. However, it does not mark an apparent difference between real 
influence (realized, therefore observed and appearing to be present) and influence that is 
not real (unrealized, therefore unobserved, and appearing to be absent). This difference 
between potential and realized influence can differ between events, processes, systems, or 
cases (cf. Bhaskar & Hartwig, 2010:109-110). Whether certain mechanisms are in opera-
tion or not is a question that can only be answered empirically. We want to emphasize 
that this does not imply total unpredictability. We learn from past research and experience 
that, given a certain configuration of conditions, some future states are more probable 
than others (Byrne, 2011a). However, this is true only in so far as such estimations are not 
built on the homogenizing assumptions of time symmetry (Prigogine, 1997; Ragin, 2000). 
To us, this implies that contingency is both epistemological and ontological in nature.
Although it is not possible to fully know reality because of the reasons given above, 
people act upon their interpretations of reality nonetheless. Their interpretations of a situa-
tion causally affect their actions, and so interpretations must be considered real, as implied 
by the Thomas theorem. In other words, people accept in their actions that the world as 
interpreted by them is real (Easton, 2010). This extends to the researcher who attempts 

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
46
to discover the causal mechanisms, but who has to understand that his interpretation can 
only gain meaning through comparison with other interpretations as every interpretation 
carries with it normative judgments. This observation makes a strong case for negotiated 
subjectivism (Byrne, 2003; Haynes, 2001; Uprichard & Byrne, 2006), which is the main 
point of departure in critical realism (Guba & Lincoln, 1989).
Critical realism may accept the notion of causality, yet Bhaskar takes issue with grand 
narratives about how positivism and its methods, especially the golden standard of the 
double-blind experiment, can uncover truth. Bhaskar holds that reality is an open system 
and that causality is systemic by definition. Inevitably, each research attempt draws arti-
ficial boundaries around its subject. Those boundaries may be negotiated, perhaps based 
on common sense in the most literal sense of the word, but they are boundaries neverthe-
less (Cilliers, 2005b). The real world, however, is unbounded. The choice to focus on 
certain variables invariably brings with it the choice to ignore others. Unavoidably, it also 
means that the observer’s normative stances are (implicitly or explicitly) embedded in the 
research, thus translating into what is being researched. Therefore, under the complexity 
sciences, the positivist claim to true, objective knowledge is unsupported.
These premises lead to the second point, namely that Bhaskar moves away from the 
positivist orientation and methods that are built on the premise of controlled conditions 
and stability in the system (e.g., Callaghan, 2008). The absence of control over the condi-
tions in the real world (as opposed to enclosed laboratories) means that it is impossible 
to establish a definitive causal account because one does not know how the conditions, in 
which a certain event or process takes place, impact causality, i.e., whether they promote 
or dampen the occurrence. This perspective has consequences for the way reality is as-
sumed to unfold. Stable systems promote predictability because the same incentives lead 
to the same result when repeated. But Bhaskar’s premise of open systems means that the 
events, processes, or behaviors that are witnessed are not caused by a supposedly fixed set 
of variables, but rather by a conjunction of variables at a certain point in time. This can be 
explained (provisionally) but not predicted (Williams, 2009).
The argument above can be summarized in a description of the nature of complex 
causality, following Byrne (2011a; 2011b). Complex causality is an interaction of generative 
mechanisms in specific contexts, resulting in unidirectional outcomes, meaning that the 
outcomes are subject to time-asymmetry. In addition to Byrne’s description, we argue 
for the plural form of mechanisms because multiple mechanisms produce an outcome in 
conjunction with context. In other words, a space of possible combinations exists, from 
which a specific configuration is triggered at a given point in time. Thus, causality is 
both real and complex, and, importantly, its contingency also applies to those studying it, 
implying that causality is, by definition, interpreted.

2.3.	
Principles of qualitative comparative analysis
In this section, we discuss the main principles of QCA and its ontological and epistemo-
logical assumptions before connecting the dots. QCA is an umbrella term that captures 
different types of case-based, comparative methods (Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a). The method 
was developed in 1987 by Ragin as a way of integrating the case-oriented and variable-
oriented approaches so as to exploit the strengths of both (Ragin, 1987). Ragin argues that 
scientists using QCA do not have to choose between the “understanding of complexity 
and knowledge of generality” (Ragin, Shulman, Weinberg, & Gran, 2003:324). QCA can 
be used to “achieve a systematic comparison across a smaller number of individual cases 
(…) in order to preserve complexity, and yet being as parsimonious as possible and illumi-
nating otherwise often hidden causal paths on a micro level” (Rihoux & Lobe, 2009:228).
It is a comparative case-based approach that allows for the examination of multiple 
causal configurations. The configurational approach implies that combinations of condi-
tions (i.e., configurations) produce certain outcomes, different combinations may produce 
the outcome, and certain conditions can have different effects in different contexts. These 
characteristics are referred to, respectively, as conjunctural causation, equifinality, and 
multifinality (Grofman & Schneider, 2009; Schneider & Wagemann, 2010), and sum-
marized collectively as causal complexity or complex causation.
QCA relies on set theory; variables are conceived as conditions, and collections of con-
ditions make up sets. Sets can be, and most often are, conceptualized and defined using 
existing theories. Cases can have different degrees of membership in a certain set. Different 
set relations or logical operators (Smithson & Verkuilen, 2006) express the characteristics 
of causal complexity. ‘Logical and’ expresses conjunctural causation (i.e., configurations 
as sets) and ‘logical or’ expresses equifinality and multifinality. All the logically possible 
configurations are listed in a truth table (Ragin, 2008a). This truth table is the key tool 
for the analysis. It sorts the cases across the various configurations and, based on measures 
of consistency and sufficiency, allows the researcher to examine the set relations between 
conditions and outcomes.
Next, the truth table can be minimized, using Boolean algebra, to produce general 
statements of the necessity and/or sufficiency of (combinations of) conditions for the 
outcomes to emerge. A condition is necessary if it has to be present for the outcome to 
occur, and sufficient if it can produce the outcome by itself. However, most often condi-
tions are not individually necessary or sufficient for phenomena to occur, but they can be 
in the context of certain other conditions (i.e., within a configuration). Such conditions 
are called INUS conditions: insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which 
is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect (Mackie, 1980). The 
minimization process leads to a summarized statement or solution formula about the 
patterns and conditions that lead to certain outcomes observed across the cases. However, 
the formula only makes sense if its constitutive conditions are theoretically related, and 
if it is reinterpreted in the light of the individual cases. Boolean minimization is only one 
part of the cycle of scientific discovery, and the researcher should return to the in-depth 

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
48
case studies, and perhaps even add new ones, to understand the meaning of the solution 
formula. Adding new cases or new conditions, or re-conceptualizing sets, may cause the 
solution formula to shift.
QCA is used in a number of different ways for social science research. Some authors, 
including Ragin himself, regard it as an approach that brings to the forefront the iterative 
movements between induction and deduction that are part of the social sciences but often 
remain implicit in research reports. This relates well to Jan Wuisman’s argument that, for 
critical realism to show its potential when examining complex systems, it is necessary that 
both induction and deduction be included in a single research cycle. He argues that, when 
the lens of critical realism is adopted by a researcher, the “process of social research is 
reconceptualized as a process of discovery in which two distinct elements as integral parts 
are incorporated” (2005:393). Using QCA to conduct research in this way means exposing 
and mapping the steps back and forth between induction and deduction.
Moreover, this approach allows qualitative and quantitative data to be combined and 
related to each other (Byrne, 2011a; Ragin, 2000). For example, a qualitative in-depth 
analysis of a limited set of cases could lay the foundations for a quantitative large-n study. 
The results from that large-n study could be fed back to the in-depth case analysis. While 
QCA perceives complexity as real, it can be used to compress large amounts of qualitative 
data, without losing the essential qualitative nature of the data, to facilitate comparison 
across cases so as to render patterns of complex causality apparent.
QCA can also be used as an alternative tool for analyzing quantitative data when 
the sample is too large to allow in-depth analysis, but too small to allow conventional 
regression analysis. Such studies, and variations on those approaches, use QCA as a frugal 
way to compress data and to arrive at meaningful results.
A somewhat similar application is when QCA is used to describe systems’ trajectories 
(Byrne, 2011b). This approach uses QCA as a descriptive tool and addresses the configura-
tions of components characterizing the state of a certain system at different moments in 
time (e.g., Vis, 2007). This configurational approach means that systems are considered 
conjunctural, and that cases or (sub-)systems are heterogeneous wholes made up of dif-
ferent parts or conditions. At the explanatory level (or Bhaskar’s third dimension), their 
heterogeneous context is assumed to influence their development and structure. Thus, 
social phenomena are considered emergent (Ragin, 1987): they result from the interactions 
between different parts or conditions. Hence, their explanation requires a consideration of 
the interactions of different conditions in relation to the phenomenon, event, or process. 
Contextual heterogeneity also implies that reality is contingent. Social phenomena operate 
in context, but this context is not similar for all social phenomena. Nevertheless, a certain 
phenomenon, event, or process can occur in a similar vein despite being embedded in a 
different context. This also means that the effects of specific conditions in this heteroge-
neous contextual configuration depend on other conditions in the configuration. Hence, 
causality in QCA is conjunctural, equifinal, and multifinal, as mentioned before, and 
characterized by INUS conditions. This is important, not because social phenomena are 
multivariate, but because “different causally relevant conditions can combine in a variety 

49
Chapter 2  |  Complex reality and QCA
of ways to produce a given outcome” (Ragin, 1987:26). In this way, QCA can be used to 
elucidate contrary or combined causal mechanisms that lead to certain system states in 
particular contexts.
2.4.	
Connecting the dots
We set out to map the connections between complexity, critical realism, and qualitative 
comparative analysis, connections that are often alluded to but seldom explicitly explained. 
We began by explicating four ontological statements about the complexity of open social 
systems: reality is non-decomposable (emergence: the whole is more than the sum of the 
parts), contingent (systems are located in systems), non-compressible (complexity is re-
cursive), and time-asymmetric (emergence: the future is developmentally open). We then 
described the usefulness of Bhaskar’s approach to critical realism as a meta-framework for 
understanding how these four statements impact the type of statements social research 
can substantiate, and the methods that can be deployed to substantiate such statements.
In short, we postulate that a reality exists outside human perception and that this 
reality is driven by causality. The term ‘causality’ does not imply universal laws or necessity. 
Rather, it concerns specific configurations that are temporal in time and local in place, 
which activate certain mechanisms that bring about that specific reality. Research can 
aid in describing and understanding how these configurations operate. However, critical 
realists understand that social reality is too complex to be fully understood, and that there 
is a difference between achieved and potential influence, and that the absence of a certain 
effect does not mean that its mechanisms are also absent.
Critical realism appears to have much in common with the ontological statements 
about complexity. Its focus is on contingency, i.e., how particular configurations activate 
certain mechanisms and how these configurations shift in time and place. This focus on 
contingency has implications for the extent to which patterns are said to reoccur over 
time. As such, it addresses the issue of time-asymmetry. Its position on reality aligns 
with complexity’s properties of non-decomposability and non-compressibility. It implies 
that both complexity and critical realism offer an anti-reductionist take on social reality 
(Sibeon, 1999).
This anti-reductionist approach is evident in QCA. It accepts that, while reality is real, 
we perceive and reconstruct it. To study this complex reality and find causal patterns that 
may explain the emergence of events, processes, or other kinds of social phenomena, we 
need to make choices, as with any study. We need to choose the descriptive and explana-
tory conditions to include in the analysis, and how to define and operationalize (i.e., per-
ceive and reconstruct) these conditions. QCA provides a dialogical research framework in 
which the researcher moves iteratively – based on actualized events (i.e., cases) – between 
observations and the discovery of mechanisms, thereby covering Bhaskar’s three dimen-
sions. In this way, the operations of QCA articulate the iterative nature of complexity 
research as a critical realist cycle of scientific discovery (Wuisman, 2005). In line with 

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
50
Byrne’s view of cases as configurations of conditions (Byrne, 2005), and as argued by 
Ragin, the researcher constructs sets of conditions that constitute the case. As implied in 
the literature, these conditions can be descriptive (Berg-Schlosser, De Meur, Rihoux, & 
Ragin, 2009), in which case the comparative analysis – conducted at different times of the 
cases’ development – can point at patterns across cases “as variate traces of the character of 
open systems” (Byrne, 2005:107). Another use can be to construct different (competing) 
mechanisms as sets, whereby these are comparatively analyzed to see which combina-
tions yield certain outcomes. Taken together and referring to Byrne’s causal critical realist 
formula of complex causality (Byrne, 2011a), cases can be reconstructed as instances of 
‘mechanisms and context’, and subsequently analyzed to find patterns of causal complex-
ity. Any analytically produced complex pattern is derived from the complexity of in-depth 
case studies, and has to be interpreted as such. This makes QCA a powerful methodology 
for analyzing complexity.
Although QCA is reductive (i.e., compresses reality), as with any type of research, and 
partial (i.e., decomposes reality), it is built on the notion of a contingent reality, which is 
at the core of complexity. This is evident in its notion of causal complexity or chemical 
causation (Ragin, 1987), as pointed out in the previous section. Furthermore, it adheres to 
the premise of time-asymmetry. Statements of complex causality are derived in hindsight. 
The cases that form the basis for these statements are actualized instances. This does not 
imply total unpredictability since we can learn from past research and experiences that cer-
tain patterns have a higher probability than others. This is evident in QCA’s identification 
of limited diversity or logical remainders, and its suggestion that we use counterfactual 
analysis (Ragin, 2008a) to cope with this.
2.5.	
Conclusion
We have argued that critical realism provides a meta-framework for understanding the re-
lationship between the complexity of the real world and qualitative comparative analysis as 
a complexity-informed method. We explored how complexity impacts the extent to which 
we can generate pertinent knowledge of social reality, and discussed the extent to which 
QCA can be used to generate provisional explanations of emergent social phenomena 
across multiple cases – provisional because the explanations are temporal in time and local 
in place. Using critical realism as a meta-framework for understanding social complexity 
enables us to position the research in this field within the debates in the philosophy of 
science. While methodological issues related to QCA’s atemporal conception of cases, and 
the deductive logic that is currently dominant in its application, are yet to be resolved, 
and although its use as a critical or complex realist method of scientific discovery is still 
limited, QCA is at its core a contingent and time-asymmetric method of social inquiry. 
QCA is not only a helpful method for analyzing complexity, as seen in its increasing use 
in the realm of complexity science, but is also complexity-informed in itself.

Abstract
This article proposes a complexity-informed framework for evaluating transportation 
infrastructure projects. The article does this through four steps. First, the properties of 
infrastructure development projects are discussed. This leads to the conclusion that the 
specific locality or contextualization of a given project is important for explaining the 
outcome. Hence, there is a need for an ontology and epistemology that addresses the 
importance of this contextualization. The second step concerns the development of the 
prerequisites for a methodological framework that follows from this epistemology and 
ontology. The third step is the assessment of common infrastructure evaluation methods 
against these prerequisites. This leads to the conclusion that a comparative case-based ap-
proach is the most suitable way to study the relationship between context and outcomes in 
projects. A framework based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is presented in the 
fourth step. The article concludes with a discussion of the further development of QCA.

Introduction
Transportation infrastructure projects are characterized by budget overruns, time delays, 
and public resistance. For example, the decision-making process for infrastructure devel-
opment in the Netherlands takes about 11 years on average (Advisory Committee VBI, 
2008). Despite this, cost overruns above 40 percent occur frequently, and sometimes 
exceed 80 percent (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003). This is not a new finding: a European study 
from a decade before had similar results (WRR, 1994a), and the effectiveness, efficiency, 
and legitimacy of infrastructure development have been debated in the Netherlands since 
the 1970s (De Hoo, 1982). The long-running discussion highlights the persistence of the 
complexity underlying infrastructure development and the lack of any quick fixes.
The poor performance of such projects has led to various attempts to better under-
stand infrastructure development, and the causes of and solutions to the problems the 
sector faces. For instance, the Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM) 
strongly advocates more and better infrastructure development evaluation, emphasizing 
the need to improve our understanding of why projects perform the way they do (KiM, 
2009). However, it is more difficult to assess ‘what’ causes than ‘that’ causes (Flyvbjerg et 
al., 2003): it is relatively easier to identify patterns of cost overruns and time delays, for 
example, than the underlying reasons why they occurred. Project evaluation has tended to 
focus on the comparison of ‘before and after’ situations, and has not adequately incorpo-
rated the influence of contextual local conditions on infrastructure project development 
(Sanderson, 2000). The dominant evaluation methodologies impede policy learning since 
they do not account sufficiently for the complex nature of policy systems (Sanderson, 
2000). KiM also similarly commented that, in addition to ex-post evaluations being 
carried out on a marginal basis, current evaluations also suffered from methodological 
deficiencies (KiM, 2009; PBL & KiM, 2010), which are related to the misfit between the 
way infrastructure development projects are understood and the methodologies used to 
evaluate them. Hence, there is a need for evaluation methodologies that do justice to the 
complex nature of infrastructure projects.
Although evaluation methodologies should pay attention to the contextual nature 
of projects to account for the influence of idiosyncratic events, this does not imply an 
exclusive focus on single-n in-depth evaluations. After all, evaluation aims to improve 
infrastructure development practice, which requires some degree of generalization (see 
Sanderson, 2000), and solely focusing on one particular context of one particular case 
does not allow recurring patterns to be analyzed. At this point, as will be shown in the 
following section, the requirements of contextualization and generalization seem to be in 
conflict with each other. On the one hand, the dominant methods used today are often 
inadequate because they discount local conditions in cross-case comparative studies. On 
the other hand, generalization from in-depth case studies is difficult.
This article aims to reconcile this dilemma. It presents a complexity-informed evalu-
ation framework based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (Ragin, 1987; 2000; 
2008a) for evaluating complex infrastructure development projects. This method integrates

the generic patterns of variable-oriented studies with the idiosyncratic events of case-based 
studies. Before presenting this method, we clarify what complex infrastructure projects are 
so as to establish their fit with the method(s) used to evaluate them (see Sanderson, 2000). 
This article aims to answer the following question: what are the ontological, epistemological, 
and methodological components of a method for assessing the influence of idiosyncratic events 
and recurring patterns on infrastructure development projects, and what should a coherent 
evaluation method based on these components consist of?
3.2.	
Generalization versus contextualization
Flyvbjerg and colleagues (Flyvbjerg et al., 2002; 2003; Flyvbjerg et al., 2003; Flyvbjerg, 
Skamris Holm, & Buhl, 2004; 2005; Flyvbjerg, 2007b; 2009b; Næss, Flyvbjerg, & Buhl, 
2006) compared 258 large infrastructure projects in 20 different countries, and found 
a number of patterns. For instance, actual costs are on average 45 percent higher than 
estimates, cost overruns are a global phenomenon, and cost performance has not improved 
over the past 70 years. Although this study and its findings are of indisputable importance 
in accounting for the ‘that’ of infrastructure development performance, it cannot explain 
the ‘why’ of cost overrun (see Flyvbjerg et al., 2003). That is, while their study finds some 
differences between rail, road, and fixed link projects, and between project types within 
these categories, this large-sample study, by its very nature, cannot explain the influence 
of local conditions on cost performance. For example, Flyvbjerg and colleagues (2003:19) 
state that:
“For the Channel Tunnel, changed safety requirements were a main cause of overrun. 
For the Great Belt link, environmental concerns and accidents with flooding and a 
devastating fire made the budget balloon. For the Øresund link, it proved more costly 
than estimated to carve major new transport infrastructure into densely populated 
Copenhagen, and so on.”
In general, the study points to many similarities amongst projects in terms of their perfor-
mance. For instance, the Øresund link and Channel Tunnel are reasonably similar regard-
ing the percentage of cost overrun (i.e., respectively 70 and 80%) (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003). 
However, the causal paths leading to those results are different. An ex-post evaluation into 
the cost performance of the Channel Tunnel revealed that, in addition to the findings of 
Flyvbjerg and colleagues, other factors also led to cost overruns (Anguera, 2006). These 
included the absence of a clear project owner from the outset, the unforeseen advent of 
low cost airlines leading to reduced train ridership, political events involving the French 
and British governments, difficult ground conditions, and transport-related incidents such 
as the Pan Am crash at Lockerbie. Although the Øresund link project is similar in some of 
these aspects, these specific conditions do not account for its cost overruns.

Chapter 3  |  Complex infrastructure projects and QCA
This brief example points to the tension between generic patterns and factors that are 
specific to a certain situation. On the one hand, large-n quantitative studies, such as those 
performed by Flyvbjerg and colleagues, provide lasting insights into generic patterns such 
as cost overruns and their causes. However, these studies do not allow a detailed analysis 
of the idiosyncratic nature of such projects, even though specific events may have signifi-
cantly contributed to the project outcomes. On the other hand, studies such as Anguera’s 
(2006) provide important insights into the unique and idiosyncratic nature of individual 
projects. However, such case-oriented studies have little to contribute to the development 
of patterns from different cases. By their very nature, both types have their advantages 
and disadvantages. Table 3.1 provides an illustrative list of both types of infrastructure 
development studies (excluding the studies by Flyvbjerg and colleagues mentioned above).

Understanding complex infrastructure projects
If an infrastructure project is said to be complex, it usually means that it is perceived to 
be difficult. However, complexity is not just a generic statement about the effort necessary 
to complete a project, nor is it a truism. Instead, it is a multi-layered concept. In abstract 
terms, developing infrastructure means modifying an existing system. An example of a 
system is a built area, which consists of interacting three-dimensional units (e.g., rooms, 
buildings, and assemblages of buildings), two-dimensional units (i.e., the layout or distri-
bution of the three-dimensional units across a given space), and linear units or transport 
networks linking the three-dimensional units, thereby largely determining the area’s layout 
(Marshall, 2009). Together, these form a built syntax specific to a given area. While some 
patterns of activity can be found in various examples of infrastructure development (e.g., 
suburbanization and subsequent commuter travel patterns), other properties are specific 
to a local situation (e.g., particular difficult ground conditions that would make the con-
struction of a road to a future suburb prohibitively expensive). Therefore, an infrastructure

developer wishing to change something in a specific situation deals with a specific built 
syntax that is a mixture of generic elements and local conditions.
Over time, the interaction of generic and specific elements leads to a local built envi-
ronment that is unique in its particularity, even though it still has recognizable elements 
(Byrne, 1998; 2001; 2003; 2005; Marshall, 2009). A built area becomes even more complex 
if its social fabric is taken into account – individuals and social groups living, working, 
traveling, and recreating in any given area – since it directly influences the existing and 
future infrastructure requirements. This syntax of built and social components is nested in 
the way that properties of a subunit (e.g., a street) reflect the properties of its whole (e.g., a 
district), but not to the extent that both levels are exact copies (Marshall, 2009). Thus, the 
local built order emerges from the interaction between generic and specific physical and 
social elements (Allen, 1998). Hence, infrastructure developers have to deal with a unique 
local area that nonetheless exhibits similarities with other areas. Developing infrastructure 
in built areas is, therefore, not just a matter of applying generic planning, building, or 
managerial rules to a certain area; these need to be adapted to fit the local conditions. 
It is pivotal for the development of infrastructure in built areas that this specific pattern 
of local conditions and generic developments is researched, to understand ex-ante how a 
project should be executed, and to understand ex-post what leads to certain outcomes.
This perspective focuses on a number of dimensions. First, infrastructure development 
takes place within a specific interacting mix of local conditions and generic patterns that 
occurs in any given location. Second, this points to the fact that the causal relationships 
between site-specific conditions and generic developments are poorly known and, if 
known, only for that specific time and place. Thus, known causal relationships specific to 
a certain area are by definition case-specific. Indeed, the unique nature of built systems 
implies that other systems are constituted differently, although the emerging order can be 
quite similar. Third, this emergent nature of any built area implies that it is the result of 
longitudinal development. That is, it is the result of past changes and events that are to 
some extent path-dependent. Taking these three points together, this article understands 
built areas as complex systems (e.g., Batty, 2010). The next question then is: how should 
this complexity as such be named, understood, and researched? This three-part ques-
tion is answered in the following section, resulting in the formulation of requisites for 
complexity-informed evaluation.
3.3.2.	 Foundations for understanding and researching situated complexity
The complexity described above can be characterized in two ways: simplistic or generic 
complexity, and complex or situated complexity (Byrne, 2005; Cilliers, 2001). Generic 
complexity focuses on the emergence of complex processes and structures from a limited 
set of variables. It assumes a general set of rules from which emergent complexity flows 
(Buijs et al., 2009). Although elegant, this approach is only part of the issue since, as we 
noted in the previous section, the emergent nature of infrastructure projects is partly 
determined by local conditions. Built areas are open systems (see De Roo, 2010), mean-

59
Chapter 3  |  Complex infrastructure projects and QCA
ing that their composition and behavior are constituted through interaction with their 
environment, resulting, as stated above, in a specific locally-situated mix of generic and 
specific elements. Considering built areas as open systems assumes that an explanation for 
the development (or lack thereof) of a project can be found in its contextualization (i.e., 
that local conditions contain explanatory variables – see Mjøset, 2009).
Buijs, Eshuis, and Byrne (2009) use ‘situated complexity’ to focus on the explanatory 
value of the contextualization of a phenomenon. Although some argue that a research 
methodology should start from either the generic or situated approach (e.g., Bar-Yam, 
1997), Buijs, Eshuis, and Byrne (2009) state that a case can and should be made for 
systematic in-depth comparison across systems. They argue that, while open systems “do 
not operate according to general rules applied in all contexts” (2009:37), a systematic com-
parison can reveal differences and similarities between the operations of different systems. 
This approach to situated complexity focuses both on recurring patterns over multiple 
systems and on the idiosyncratic events in particular systems, since both determine how 
systems develop over time. The research methodology presented in this article starts from 
that premise.
The second part of the question concerns the way complexity is understood, which 
is basically a question of how reality can be understood. The classical divide is between 
positivism and postpositivism. To some extent, this divide coincides with the difference 
between generic and situated complexity. Positivism is primarily concerned with deter-
mining general rules by taking reality apart in discrete components, which matches the 
aims of studies of generic complexity. However, postpositivism has many different sub-
strands that range from the extreme relativism of social constructivism to the more realist 
thesis of negotiated subjectivism (Byrne, 2003; Haynes, 2001; Uprichard & Byrne, 2006) 
or critical realism (Guba & Lincoln, 1989). The common theme within those strands is 
that the contextualization is explanatory for what is being observed, which coincides with 
situated complexity.
The fact-value dichotomy that underlies the positivist stance has been thoroughly 
undermined (Bateson, 1984; Byrne, 2002; Fischer & Forester, 1987; 1993). Complex and 
systemic causality is always subject to interpretation and, consequently, debatable as every 
interpretation carries with it normative judgments (Williams, 2009). If systems are said to 
be open, then it follows that their boundaries do not exist a priori, and any individual will 
develop a particular demarcation or set of boundary judgments about the system which 
includes and excludes variables (i.e., a reduction of real complexity), that may be con-
nected but not perceived as such by the observer (Checkland, 1981; Cilliers, 2001). Thus, 
there is no unambiguous separation between systems and their context, and the observer 
is as much part of the complexity as the system or agents that are observed. Situated 
complexity is, therefore, not confined to the presupposed demarcations of systems but 
intersects all system representations by respondents.
This reduction of real complexity both compromises the research, as well as keeps it 
manageable (Cilliers, 2001; 2005a). It requires that multiple perspectives on a particular 
system are taken into account. If a multitude of observers can develop a multitude of 

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
60
boundary judgments about what is taken into account or not with a multitude of per-
spectives about how something is being perceived, chances are that a larger part of the 
complexity of the system is captured (Cilliers, 1998; 2005a). This type of thinking implies 
a convergence of the fact-value dichotomy, but not a postmodern stance where subjective 
storytelling is all that remains. It means that, although temporal in time and place (i.e., 
specific to a given locality), cause and effect relations do exist and can be known through 
respondents’ perceptions (i.e., it is agent-bound) (Byrne, 2001; 2003; 2005; Morçöl, 2001). 
Causality can still be determined in terms of change and response relationships that lead to 
certain observable effects (see Bryman, 2004; Hammersley, 2008; 2009). The ontological 
point of departure in this article is, therefore, complex realism (see Byrne, 2002; Harvey, 
2009; Reed & Harvey, 1992).
Researching situated complexity from the perspective of complex realism requires 
a methodology that focuses both on recurring patterns over multiple systems as cases 
and on systemic peculiarities, that acknowledges that these patterns and peculiarities are 
interpretations but point to real causalities nevertheless. Taking these points together, the 
first criterion for a complexity-informed methodological framework is (1) that it balances 
between in-depth understanding and reductionist generalization. Second, since studying 
situated complexity requires an in-depth understanding of cases, (2) the method has to 
be case-based. Moreover, since single case studies cannot be employed for explanatory 
purposes in other cases and, therefore, do not allow statements about patterns across 
systems, a comparative case study approach is required. Third, as stated above, situated 
complexity focuses on the explanatory value of contextualization. This contextualization 
emerges from the interaction of generic patterns and specific events, and therefore it can be 
inferred that, in methodological terms, (3) the method should allow the observation and 
analysis of complex interaction between the variables. This is discussed in the following 
sections. Finally, since complex systems, such as built areas, are the result of longitudinal 
development, (4) the method has to consider how situated complexity came into being 
over time (i.e., complex dynamics).
3.3.3.	
Towards a complexity-informed case-comparative framework
These four requirements are only partly fulfilled by the two general evaluation approaches 
presented above. Variable-oriented studies, such as those conducted by Flyvbjerg and col-
leagues (2003), examine relationships between general features of infrastructure projects. 
These features are conceived as variables (e.g., project type, topography, and cost overrun) 
and are then correlated with each other. This makes it possible to deduce empirical gener-
alizations about structural processes relevant to a larger number of cases (Ragin, 1987). For 
instance, cost underestimation and overruns occur more often in rail projects and, within 
rail projects, overruns are higher in developing nations than in North America and Europe 
(Flyvbjerg, 2007a).
However, “the simplifying assumptions that make this approach possible often violate 
commonsense notions of causation and sometimes pose serious obstacles to making 

61
Chapter 3  |  Complex infrastructure projects and QCA
interpretative statements about specific cases or even about categories of cases” (Ragin, 
1987:xiii). In essence, Flyvbjerg’s studies cannot account for the idiosyncratic nature of 
specific cases as the study of Anguera (2006) can, because variable-oriented studies are, 
by their nature, not case-oriented. Furthermore, correlational methods cannot deal with 
contextualization; they do not allow for complex causality (see next section). For example, 
in the work of Flyvbjerg and colleagues, the importance of the context is recognized by 
pointing to the fact that cost overruns are due to different circumstances. However, this is 
not reflected in the generic patterns that appear in the research. Finally, variable-oriented 
studies can account for time. For instance, Flyvbjerg and colleagues (2003) conclude that 
infrastructure development performance has not improved in the past 70 years. However, 
such studies have a hard time including complex dynamics, such as the influence of par-
ticular events (e.g., the crash at Lockerbie) on the course of the development of a specific 
case.
Case-based methods are, by their nature, sensitive to the complexity, diversity, and 
(historical) uniqueness of cases (Ragin, 1987). Projects are treated holistically and not 
as collections of parts; case studies are sensitive to contextualization and temporality. 
For instance, Anguera (2006) is able to discuss in detail the Channel Tunnel project, its 
performance, and the key factors that influenced the latter. However, in the words of 
Aus (2009:175), “most case studies (…) could maliciously be qualified as theoretical ‘data 
dumps’. One of the methodological reasons for this rather unfortunate state-of-the-art 
is that single case studies can hardly be employed for explanatory purposes.” Hence, the 
methodology needs to be case-comparative to allow for causal inference (Aus, 2009) – for 
studying patterns across cases.
However, when case study material is analyzed and compared in case-comparative 
studies, this often happens rather loosely and in a non-formalized manner (Rihoux, 2006). 
Often, qualitative comparative studies, necessarily limited in the number of cases, result in 
an overview of the most important similarities and differences (Rihoux & De Meur, 2009). 
This comparative process is often not formalized, in the sense that little insight is and 
can be provided into the way it was performed, including identifying the decisions that 
influenced the outcomes of the comparative process. In addition, the rich data represents 
many possible causal conditions that are often hard to disentangle. Consequently, the 
scientific value of these studies is often questioned (Ragin, 1987). Table 3.2 summarizes the 
strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, and compares them with QCA as a hybrid 
alternative research approach that integrates the strengths of both approaches, thereby 
mitigating their weaknesses.

Qualitative comparative analysis
3.4.1.	
A hybrid alternative
QCA is an umbrella term for three comparative methods: crisp set QCA (csQCA), multi-
value QCA (mvQCA), and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA) (Rihoux & Ragin, 2009b). It aims to 
integrate the case-oriented and variable-oriented approaches so that scientists do not have 
to choose between an “understanding of complexity and knowledge of generality” (Ragin 
et al., 2003:324). QCA can be used to “achieve a systematic comparison across a smaller 
number of individual cases (e.g., a sample of between 10 and 30 cases) in order to preserve 
complexity, and yet being as parsimonious as possible and illuminating otherwise often 
hidden causal paths on a micro level” (Rihoux & Lobe, 2009:228).
It is a comparative case-based approach that allows the examination of multiple causal 
configurations (Byrne, 2009). This approach aims to uncover the most frequent combina-
tions of causal conditions (i.e., variables) that produce a certain outcome. For instance, 
Anguera (2006) presents several factors that affected cost overruns in the Channel Tunnel 
project. However, different configurations may produce the outcome. For instance, the 
Øresund link and the Channel Tunnel have similar outcomes, but their configurational 
paths towards that outcome are different. In addition, factors can have different effects 
in different contexts. For instance, the advent of low-cost airlines had different effects on 
the Channel Tunnel and the Øresund link because of their different contexts and natures. 
Grofman and Schneider (2009) and Schneider and Wagemann (2010) refer to these char-
acteristics of complex causality as conjunctural causation, equifinality, and multifinality, 
respectively. They add to this the notion of asymmetric causality (i.e., that the presence 
and absence of outcomes require different explanations). In sum, the approach ticks all of 
the boxes in Table 3.2, excluding, as discussed later, the last one concerning temporality.
3.4.2.	 QCA as a complexity-informed research approach
It is important to clarify that QCA is not just a method; it is first of all a research approach 
(Rihoux, 2003). Central to this approach is the dialogue between theoretical ideas and

empirical evidence (Berg-Schlosser et al., 2009; Ragin, 1987; 2000; 2008a; Yamasaki & 
Rihoux, 2009), which is especially important in the selection and construction of cases 
and variables. In QCA, variables are conceptualized as causal conditions or sets. For in-
stance, the Channel Tunnel, Øresund link, and Great Belt link cases are members of the 
‘transportation infrastructure projects’ set.
What makes set theory interesting for case-comparative studies is that sets can be 
intersected (i.e., the set operator ‘logical and’ – referring to conjunctural causation) and 
unified (i.e., the set operator ‘logical or’ – referring to equifinality and multifinality). QCA 
is able to systematically compare and analyze these set conjunctions (i.e., configurations or 
causal recipes) (Ragin, 1987; 2000; 2008a; Smithson & Verkuilen, 2006).
However, social phenomena such as infrastructure development are often difficult to 
grasp in terms of sets. For instance, compare the relative ease of defining the set boundaries 
of concepts such as ‘democracy’ and ‘legitimacy’ with ‘transport modes’. Producing a list of 
projects that fit a certain type of transport mode is probably easier than listing the legiti-
mate public participation processes involved in infrastructure development projects (see 
Smithson & Verkuilen, 2006). Therefore, theoretical and substantive knowledge should be 
used to substantiate the construction (and membership) of sets.
3.4.3.	
Illustrating QCA for the evaluation of situated complexity
Using set theory implies a focus on set relations instead of correlations. Instead of studying 
the net-additive effects of variables, QCA studies the necessity and sufficiency of rela-
tions between (configurations of) sets and the outcome (Ragin, 1987; 1999; 2000; 2008a; 
Schneider & Wagemann, 2010). A condition is necessary if it has to be present for the out-
come to occur, indicated by the outcome being a subset of the causal condition. Suppose 
condition B is the set ‘cost overrun’ and condition A is the set ‘construction delay’. Then, 
Figure 3.1 shows that every case that exhibits cost overrun also exhibits construction delay. 
A
B
 
Figure 3.1 Set relations

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
64
If a case does not exhibit A, then it cannot be in set B. This would point to construction 
delay as a necessary condition for the outcome to occur.
A condition is sufficient if it can produce the outcome by itself, indicated by the condi-
tion being a subset of the outcome. Now suppose that B is the set ‘construction delay’ and 
A is ‘cost overrun’. Then, Figure 3.1 shows that every case that exhibits construction delay 
also exhibits cost overrun. If construction delay is the only condition at play, then this 
figure indicates that it alone is sufficient to produce cost overrun.
However, necessary and sufficient conditions can, and most often are, combined 
within a causal recipe since causation is complex (Ragin, 2000). This means that there 
are usually no purely necessary or sufficient conditions for an outcome to occur (i.e., 
overlapping sets). Such a condition is called an INUS condition, which can be defined as 
an “insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition” (Mackie, 
1980:62, original italics). For example, imagine that the Channel Tunnel, Great Belt link, 
and Øresund link have different ‘scores’ on three causal conditions A, B, and C. Suppose 
that the Channel Tunnel exhibits conditions A and B, the Great Belt link conditions B and 
C, and the Øresund link conditions A and C. Thus, there are three configurations: A*B, 
B*C, and A*C. The * sign indicates ‘logical and’. These three different paths produce the 
outcome cost overrun. This implies ‘logical or’, indicated by a + sign. This can be written 
as a Boolean expression, namely:
A*B + B*C + A*C → cost overrun
This means, first, that none of the three conditions is individually sufficient since in none 
of the three cases the outcome is produced by a single condition. Second, it means that 
none of the three conditions is necessary. For instance, condition A is not necessary for 
cost overrun to appear, since the outcome can also appear with the combination B*C. 
It does mean, however, that A is an INUS condition: it is an insufficient (i.e., it cannot 
produce the outcome by itself) but non-redundant (i.e., it is a necessary condition in both 
the combinations A*B and A*C) part of an unnecessary (i.e., A*B and A*C are not neces-
sary since cost overrun also appears in B*C) but sufficient (i.e., A*B and A*C are sufficient 
for cost overrun to occur) condition. Finally, it is important to note that “neither necessity 
nor sufficiency exists independently of theories that propose causes” (Ragin, 2008b:42), 
because this distinction is only meaningful in the context of theoretical perspectives. In 
other words, the contextualization of the research method is confined to the included sets, 
whose construction is substantiated with theoretical and substantive knowledge.
When each case is assigned a set membership score for each of the conditions, the 
researcher can move from mere theoretical (i.e., set construction) and empirical (i.e., case 
scoring) description to comparative analysis. The first step is the construction of the truth 
table. The fundamental unit of analysis is the truth table row (Ragin, 1999). A truth table 
lists all of the logically possible configurations – expressed by the exponential formula 2k (k 
being the number of conditions), since a condition can be both present and absent – and 
sorts (i.e., assesses the empirical presence of) the cases over to these configurations in the 

65
Chapter 3  |  Complex infrastructure projects and QCA
‘distribution of cases’ column. Next, for each causal recipe the outcome value is defined. 
For illustrative purposes, a hypothetical truth table with three conditions is depicted as 
Table 3.3.
Note that the process described so far has taken the researcher from qualitative thick-
case descriptions of cases  –  which are preferably based upon multiple perspectives by 
(multiple) researchers – via the construction of sets and the assignment of set membership 
scores, towards the construction of the truth table. One might argue that this discounts 
the unique and complex nature of cases. However, the method actually facilitates the 
interpretive and iterative research process by formalizing the comparative procedures from 
an in-depth understanding of complex systems to the identification of recurring patterns 
over multiple systems, without undermining the essence of complex systems: their contex-
tualization and complex causation.
Next, the truth table can be minimized to produce a so-called solution (i.e., a state-
ment about patterns across the cases). Maximum complexity was assumed a priori, and 
this complexity is now brought back to its core. This minimization process is structured by 
using Boolean algebra. Its basic procedure can be summarized as follows: “if two Boolean 
expressions differ in only one causal condition yet produce the same outcome, then the 
causal condition that distinguishes the two expressions can be considered irrelevant and 
can be removed to create a simpler, combined expression” (Ragin, 1987:93). For example, 
the previous hypothetical truth table gives the following Boolean expressions:
A*B*C + A*B*~C + A*~B*C + A*~B*~C + ~A*B*C → cost overrun
The tilde sign (~) indicates the absence of a condition. This formula shows five empirically 
observed paths towards cost overrun. As a next step, it can be evaluated what the sufficient, 
necessary, and/or INUS conditions are in this expression.

The first two configurations can be minimized to A*B: whether condition C is present 
or not, cost overrun appears nonetheless. This pairwise minimization procedure is further 
displayed in Figure 3.2 and results in the following solution formula:
A + B*C → cost overrun
It is pivotal that the resulting formula is not applied mechanically in concluding the 
comparative analysis. As stated above, QCA is first of all a case-based qualitative approach. 
It involves the researcher interpreting the formula and critically assessing it in light of the 
individual cases: does it make sense? As a consequence, the comparative research process 
should consist of several iterations between data and concepts, generating increased un-
derstanding/interpretation of the cases. Indeed, the researcher will often be forced to do so 
since contradictory configurations (i.e., a configuration that produces opposing outcomes 
across cases) require adapting the selection and conceptualization of conditions. As such, 
QCA allows a continuous search into the conditions under which infrastructure projects 
are being realized, and enables the researcher to find causal patterns that are deeply hidden 
in the appearances of the projects.

Discussion and conclusions
Rooted in the logic of situated complexity, we made the case for the use of QCA to evaluate 
infrastructure projects, thereby contributing to the discussion of complexity in evaluation 
(see Callaghan, 2008) and of QCA in evaluation (see Befani et al., 2007; Marx, 2005). 
We provided a brief overview of the logic and main procedures of QCA. Inevitably, some 
in-depth aspects were left out, such as limited diversity/logical remainders, contradictory 
rows, counterfactual analysis, and the consistency and coverage measures; unfortunately, it 
is not possible to discuss these due to the limited space available. However, it is necessary 
here to elaborate on a further development in QCA, namely fuzzy set QCA.

Chapter 3  |  Complex infrastructure projects and QCA
FsQCA was introduced by Ragin (2000). Although csQCA and fsQCA are equal in 
their set-theoretic and configurational rationale, a dichotomous distinction is made in 
csQCA (Ragin, 1987) between the absence and presence of causal conditions in a case 
(i.e., crisp sets). FsQCA, on the other hand, allows for finer gradients in the degree of 
set membership (i.e., a variable does not need to be fully present or absent in a case) 
(see Ragin, 2000; 2008a). For instance, with crisp set QCA, an infrastructure project can 
be fully in or fully out of the set ‘cost overrun’ (i.e., it can score 0 or 1). However, one 
might argue that a cost overrun of 70 percent in the Øresund link project is substantially 
different from a cost overrun of 110 percent in the Great Belt project (see Flyvbjerg et al., 
2003). Therefore, the latter may have a stronger presence in the ‘cost overrun’ set than the 
former. This can be formalized by assigning different set memberships to these cases (e.g., 
1.0 for the Great Belt project and 0.7 for the Øresund project). In this manner, fsQCA can 
be said to more accurately describe the complexity of infrastructure projects compared to 
QCA based on crisp sets.
We formulated four requirements for an evaluation approach that would match the 
complexity of infrastructure projects. While QCA fulfills three of the four requisites, it 
does less well on the fourth dimension (i.e., time). In essence, QCA is a static method 
(Rihoux, 2003) and does not fully capture the dynamics of complex systems (Gerrits, 
2011). Some provisional workarounds, suggested by Rihoux (2003), De Meur, Rihoux, and 
Yamasaki (2009), and others, capture the time dimension by: using multiple iterations of 
the method (i.e., before, during, and after a certain intervention), interpreting the time 
dimension, conceptualizing time as (part of) a set, or complementing QCA with other 
methods. Attempts are also being made to develop a distinct time-inclusive type of QCA 
(Caren & Panofsky, 2005).
However, all options are compromises and researchers should be aware that, while 
QCA is useful for mapping the systemic complexity of infrastructure development, it 
is less useful for incorporating time dynamics. One could argue that this is not really a 
problem in the case of ex-post evaluation, which measures the static outcome of a project, 
but may be more of a concern in ex-durante evaluations, where time is an important part 
of the evaluation. However, we argue that one needs the time dimension to understand 
the emergence of outcomes, i.e., whether the observations at tn+1 are the result of the 
configurational changes that took place at tn. Time matters in evaluation, and it is an 
unresolved issue with the QCA approach.
Another inherent limit of (fs)QCA is the number of conditions that can be taken into 
account, since the logically possible number of combinations increases exponentially. At 
the same time, the addition of a new case to the set of cases being compared can lead to 
a different solution formula. Although both issues are not unique to QCA – one could 
argue that such limitations are an innate part of research into social reality – they should 
not be ignored. Regarding the limited number of conditions being considered, Rihoux 
(2003) and De Meur, Rihoux, and Yamasaki (2009) suggest that a possible remedy is to 
carry out multiple routines, i.e., building an increasingly clearer set of conditions by going 
through the QCA process multiple times. This way, the researcher is able to find out, in a 

Part 2  |  Ontology, epistemology, and methodology
68
very transparent way (Rihoux, Ragin, Yamasaki, & Bol, 2009), which conditions do not 
matter or yield the same or similar results. These conditions can then be excluded from the 
analysis or grouped together as macro variables. Schneider and Wagemann (2006) provide 
an alternative staged approach: first, remote (e.g., contextual) and proximate factors are 
analyzed separately, and in the second stage, the remote and proximate factors that have 
been found to be influential are analyzed together.
The second issue, the possibility of arriving at different conclusions after adding new 
cases, is actually part of the philosophy behind QCA and its roots in systemic thinking. 
With QCA, the researcher does not strive to identify a single central tendency that reflects 
reality as more cases are added (Rihoux, 2003). Rather, it helps researchers to examine 
the different causal pathways that lead to a particular outcome, and how such pathways 
are linked to individual cases. Adding a new case can lead to the discovery of a new 
pathway. More commonly deployed comparisons aim to find the variable that controls 
for differences and similarities in multiple cases. Following the discussion on generic and 
situated complexity, such a search is beside the point. Cases can have unique pathways 
and comparison should be used to highlight the particularities of the pathways. It is also 
through this perspective that thinking in terms of dependent or independent variables is 
replaced by thinking in configurations (Aus, 2009), which resembles social reality more 
closely.
In short, our argument is that QCA is a promising approach that largely meets the 
evaluation requirements set out at the start. Some issues will have to be dealt with, most 
prominently the issue of time. The next step is to use QCA in an evaluation study to 
evaluate its viability as a tool for analyzing complex infrastructure development projects.

implementations
Th is part of the thesis focuses on the fi rst, fourth, and fi fth sub-questions. it explains how the 
management of the implementation processes of PPP infrastructure projects can be understood 
from a complexity perspective (i.e., the fi rst sub-question), it examines how the implementa-
tions are managed empirically (i.e., the fourth sub-question), what management responses to 
unforeseen events yield (un)satisfactory outcomes (i.e., the fourth sub-question), and how these 
outcomes can be explained (i.e., the fi fth sub-question). Th e chapters in Part 2 were formative 
for the chapters in this third part.
Marra makes the point that “evaluation should look not just at what the system is producing 
in terms of outcomes, but also ‘into the system’ at how the system is doing and what it is 
doing” (2011:322). in this vein, chapter 4 studies how public and private managers in the A2 
Maastricht project manage the complexity of project implementation, and what management 
responses are associated with (un)satisfactory outcomes. in chapter 5, this is also done for the 
A15 Maasvlakte-vaanplein (Mava) project. chapter 4 is published as an article in the journal 
Public Works Management & Policy (verweij & Gerrits, 2015) and chapter 5 is published as an 
article in the International Journal of Project Management (verweij, 2015a).
Because PPP infrastructure project implementation processes are complex but patterns can be 
found in them and across them, the studies have a grounded approach. complexity-informed 
analysis “assumes an exploratory or pattern recognition approach, rather than a traditional 
hypothesis-testing or confi rmatory approach” (Wolf-Branigin, 2013:71). As such, within the 
two studies respectively, QcA is applied to study patterns of how managers respond (un)
satisfactorily to diff erent events occurring in project implementation processes.
Whereas many studies in the fi eld of infrastructure development and public-private partner-
ships use quantitative measures of performance for evaluating projects, the outcome in this 
thesis is ‘satisfaction’. in contrast to performance measures, satisfaction is better able to address 
the complex, heterogeneous, and subjective nature of outcomes in project implementation 
processes (Kärnä et al., 2013; lehtiranta et al., 2012). 
chapter 6 takes stock of the two studies. it aims to further articulate what can explain the 
management patterns within the implementations of the two projects, and what can explain the 
diff erent patterns across them. Th e chapter has been submitted to a journal.

Abstract
In the implementation phase of transportation infrastructure projects, unplanned events 
will inevitably occur. Although this is increasingly acknowledged, little systematic re-
search has been conducted into what management strategies are best for dealing with 
these unplanned events. This article investigates how managers respond to unplanned 
events that occur in the context of a project during implementation, and which manage-
ment responses produce satisfactory outcomes. To evaluate what strategies work in what 
contexts, we introduce multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA) and apply 
it to the Dutch A2 Maastricht transportation infrastructure project (the Netherlands). 
We produced systematic evidence that (a) internally-oriented private management is 
associated with low satisfaction; (b) externally-oriented management is associated with 
high satisfaction in responding to social, local unplanned events; and (c) that internally-
oriented management is associated with high satisfaction depending, in particular, on the 
nature of the cooperation between principal and contractor in the project.

Introduction
Generally speaking, transportation infrastructure projects are characterized by, inter alia, 
cost overruns (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003) and lingering implementation processes (Advisory 
Committee VBI, 2008; De Hoo, 1982). One family of explanatory factors of this undesir-
able state of affairs is the context in which projects are being implemented. In studying 
five large U.S. transportation infrastructure projects, Owens, Ahn, Shane, Strong, and 
Gransberg found that in addition to “factors found in the traditional management areas 
(cost, schedule, and design)” (2012:186), external forces or context were considered a 
primary source of complications in those projects. Other scholars (cf. Mistarihi et al., 
2013) also demonstrate the importance of context for understanding complications in 
infrastructure development, especially in the implementation – that is, construction and 
delivery – phase of projects. For instance, Teisman, Westerveld, and Hertogh studied the 
Dutch Betuweline and the U.K. West Coast Main Line and demonstrated that imple-
mentation processes are compromised by unplanned events, and that “managers cannot 
know in advance what the relevant context will be and how contexts will interfere with 
implementation and with one another” (2009:72).
Although this uncertain and badly predictable context in the implementation of infra-
structure projects is increasingly acknowledged (e.g., Atkinson, Crawford, & Ward, 2006), 
little systematic research has been conducted into which management strategies are best 
for dealing with (i.e., responding to) unforeseen and unplanned events in implementing 
projects (Mistarihi et al., 2013). A generic distinction is made in the management literature 
between two more or less opposite management strategies: (a) internally-oriented strate-
gies that focus on the internal structures of project organization (e.g., Mantel, Meredith, 
Shafer, & Sutton, 2005) – for example, doubling shifts or changing construction modes 
in an attempt to control planning and budget – and (b) externally-oriented strategies that 
emphasize interaction with the social (stakeholder) environment in which the project is 
developed (e.g., Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004). Research suggests that the latter approach 
leads to more satisfactory outcomes (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Klijn, Steijn, & Edelenbos, 
2010) although, importantly, not necessarily always so (Verweij et al., 2013). The scientific 
literature is rather ambivalent about this relationship between management strategies and 
outcomes in project implementation (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). Consequently, proposals 
focus on a balance between the two strategies (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2006; Edelenbos 
& Teisman, 2008; Hertogh & Westerveld, 2010). But what does this ‘balancing’ entail? 
And perhaps more importantly, how is it that sometimes a certain management strategy 
results in satisfactory outcomes, and sometimes not? These are largely underexposed ques-
tions. Research into this can contribute to the successful management of transportation 
infrastructure projects in their implementation phases. Hence, the research question of 
this article is as follows: how do managers in the implementation phase respond to unplanned 
events occurring in the context of the transportation infrastructure project, and which manage-
ment responses produce satisfactory outcomes?

Methodologies to systematically evaluate these issues seem to run behind (cf. Verweij 
& Gerrits, 2013). For one thing, little structural attention is given to actual day-to-day 
management actions in specific circumstances, that is, how managers respond to unfore-
seen and unplanned events, whilst these are pivotal to understanding how outcomes come 
about in projects (cf. Atkinson et al., 2006; Cicmil, Williams, Thomas, & Hodgson, 2006). 
Moreover, traditional evaluations of transportation projects tend to focus on comparing 
‘before and after’, thereby often inadequately reckoning with context in their assessments. 
This significantly impedes learning from such evaluations because context is explanatory 
to how outcomes come about (Pawson & Tilley, 1997; Sanderson, 2000). Evaluation meth-
odologies need to match the complex nature of transportation infrastructure development 
(Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). In short, we need a context-sensitive method that is empirically 
grounded so as to study management actions in response to unplanned events, and that is 
able to systematically evaluate when and why these produce certain outcomes and when 
they don’t, such that learning is facilitated in a meaningful way.
In two previous articles, we have laid the groundwork for such a method, namely, 
qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). In this article, we apply one of the proposed 
versions, mvQCA, to the Dutch A2 Maastricht transportation infrastructure project. This 
is done in a number of steps. First, in Section 4.2, we will briefly explain the evaluation 
method and the perspective on the complexity of managing infrastructure projects that 
underlies it. In Section 4.3, we introduce the A2 Maastricht project and the data we col-
lected. These data are stepwise analyzed in Section 4.4. Following the grounded approach, 
we first identify and define the conditions of our analysis: the nature of the unplanned 
event (physical  –  social), the management response (internally-oriented  –  externally-
oriented), the interaction between principal and contractor (acting alone – cooperation), 
and the outcome (satisfaction with how the event was responded to). In Section 4.5, we 
conclude our article, and discuss implications for managers and evaluators of transporta-
tion infrastructure projects.
4.2.	
Researching complex transportation 
infrastructure projects
In Section 4.2.1, we briefly outline our understanding of ‘complexity’, that is, what it is 
about the projects that makes them complex. Following our understanding, we introduce 
the related methodology in Section 4.2.2. For a more elaborate discussion and explana-
tion, we refer to Gerrits and Verweij (2013) and Verweij and Gerrits (2013).
4.2.1.	
Properties of complexity in infrastructure project management
An infrastructure project is implemented in a complex socio-physical context. Unplanned 
events (e.g., bad weather or stakeholder protests) may occur in this context. Naturally, 
these can impact the planning and aims of the project. Managers respond to such events in 

77
Chapter 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A2 project
an attempt to safeguard satisfactory outcomes (e.g., prevent time delays and budget over-
runs – cf. Atkinson et al., 2006). Managers often have to respond to different and multiple 
such events, each of which may require various management strategies. Such instances are 
considered cases in this article; the project investigated here, the A2, can be considered a 
long-term spatial program that consists of series of cases. Thus, within a single infrastruc-
ture project there are multiple and different cases of ‘responding to unplanned events’.
This also means that, contrary to the positivist take on reality, in different contexts 
the same management response can produce different outcomes, and different responses 
can produce similar outcomes (cf. Byrne, 2011a; 2011b; Pawson & Tilley, 1997; Sayer, 
2000). For example, within a single infrastructure project, one and the same management 
response may result in preventing the project planning to get out of hand in the case 
of one unplanned event, but not in another; this depends on the nature of the event. 
Furthermore, there may be multiple conditions interacting with one another. That is, 
the effect of the management response is codetermined by other conditions, such as the 
cooperation between principal and contractor. This implies a research approach that can 
study the complex interaction between conditions (see Section 4.2.2).
In addition, knowledge about the management of such projects is situated and con-
textual. This applies to the evaluator and the managers working in the projects. In short, 
the actions of managers are context-dependent. A manager interprets an event and conse-
quently acts on it with the intention to produce satisfactory outcomes. These actions, in 
turn, causally influence the project’s development. This means that, to understand the ways 
in which the project develops, it is essential that the researcher looks at how the manager(s) 
interpret(s) the event. In other words, the interpretations of managers are the researcher’s 
‘entrance’ to understanding and evaluating transportation infrastructure development. 
This perspective favors a qualitative (interpretative) grounded research approach in which 
managers are studied in their contexts – what they do, why, and with what outcomes – on 
which causal explanation is grounded (cf. Cicmil et al., 2006; Verweij, 2012a).
Finally, in evaluating transportation infrastructure development, it may not be pos-
sible to define beforehand what aspects should be researched. Because managers act in an 
uncertain and badly predictable context (Atkinson et al., 2006; Teisman, Westerveld et al., 
2009), and because their responses are informed by their interpretations of events and not 
by the theories proposed by evaluators (cf. Pawson & Tilley, 1997), what constitutes a case 
of ‘management in response to an unplanned event’ cannot and should not be predefined 
by the researcher. That is,
“It is not possible to construct verbal formulations [i.e., theory, authors] that can 
embrace or contend with the complexity and diversity of the empirical world. For 
these and related reasons, cases often must be delimited or found in the course of research” 
(Ragin, 1992:220, emphasis added).
Discovering and studying cases is often a key object of the research (Sayer, 2000). Again, 
this favors a qualitative and grounded research approach.

4.2.2.	 Researching complexity in infrastructure project management with mvQCA
Following these three properties, the first step of the method involves the grounded col-
lection of data. Open, qualitative interviews are especially suitable for this purpose (e.g., 
Weiss, 1994) because this allows the researcher to fully grasp the managers’ perspectives 
of the event (instead of testing those of the researcher), their consequent management 
responses, and the outcomes. The second step is to code the resulting data (e.g., Boeije, 
2010) so as to facilitate the reconstruction of cases. Coding facilitates the synthesis of dif-
ferent manager perspectives into a single coherent reconstruction per case. By coding and 
memo-writing, ideas about the collected interview data are recorded, thus allowing for 
those ideas to be reinterpreted (Schwartz-Shea & Yanow, 2012). This interpretive process 
is influenced by existing ideas about complexity (theory) and managing infrastructure 
projects with which the researcher is familiarized. Ragin coins this quest ‘casing’ – which 
is best understood as a dialogue between ideas and evidence or theory and data – which 
can bring operational closure to the relationship between the empirical world and the way 
we reconstruct it (Ragin, 1992; Ragin & Amoroso, 2011). This second step results in the 
construction of conditions (see Section 4.4.1) that influence a case (cf. Byrne, 2005).
Qualitative comparative analysis – an umbrella term for several types of QCA (see 
Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a) – is deployed in the third step. In short technical terms, QCA 
allows for the iterative examination of patterns of complex causality through pairwise 
comparison of cases as combinations of conditions (i.e., configurations – Ragin, 1987; 
Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). Complex causality means that conditions combine in 
configurations; that there may be multiple, different, nonexclusive configurations for the 
outcome; and that the effect of a condition on the outcome depends on its interaction 
with other conditions in the configuration (see further Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). 
The specific type of QCA we use in this article is multi-value QCA (mvQCA – Cronqvist 
& Berg-Schlosser, 2009), in which conditions can have multiple values, for example, 0, 1, 
and 2. We demonstrate mvQCA in Section 4.4.2.
The basic logic of the approach consists of several subroutines: (a) construct cases as 
configurations and put them in a ‘data matrix’, which includes assigning values to the 
conditions per case based on the coded data; (b) organize the cases over the logically 
possible configurations in a so-called ‘truth table’ (see Section 4.4.2); (c) assign values 
to the outcome condition per configuration; and (d) identify minimal (combinations of; 
necessary and) sufficient conditions through pairwise comparison of configurations that 
agree on the outcome and differ in but one other condition (i.e., ‘minimization’).
A condition is necessary if the outcome cannot be produced without it. A condition is 
sufficient if it can produce the outcome by itself. Complex causality, however, implies that 
necessary and sufficient conditions often combine. Within a combination, a condition is 
INUS, that is, an insufficient but necessary part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition 
(Mackie, 1980). This combining (‘intersection’) of conditions is expressed by the operator 
logical and (* sign); the existence of different and multiple combinations is expressed 
by the operator logical or (+ sign). The degree to which the empirical evidence supports 

79
Chapter 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A2 project
claiming necessity and/or sufficiency is expressed in terms of consistency. Basically, this 
“gauges the degree to which the cases sharing a given combination of conditions agree in 
displaying the outcome” (Ragin, 2008a:44). The empirical strength of a (combination of) 
condition(s) is expressed in terms of coverage (see Schneider & Wagemann, 2012).
Importantly, interpretation of patterns occurs throughout the iterative process and 
is of pivotal importance in concluding (see Section 4.5.2) the analysis. For a detailed 
explanation and overview, we refer to the large body of methodological literature on QCA 
(e.g., Ragin, 1987; Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a; Schneider & Wagemann, 2012) but, for meth-
odological reasons, it is important (see Schneider & Wagemann, 2010) to explain here 
why we selected the specific type of mvQCA. The first reason is that the conditions we 
constructed do not represent interval or ratio scales. Second, prior to the mvQCA analysis 
presented in this article, we performed a crisp set QCA (Rihoux & De Meur, 2009) and a 
fuzzy set QCA (Ragin, 2009), but all these produced quite a few contradictions that could 
largely be resolved with mvQCA. The mvQCA was performed using Tosmana software 
(Cronqvist, 2011).
4.3.	
Data collection about the A2 Maastricht 
project
The A2 passageway Maastricht project concerns the construction of a 2.3-km-long double-
deck, double-tube tunnel running under the city of Maastricht. The tunnel is constructed 
using the cut and cover method. It is managed by a cooperation between four govern-
ments  –  Rijkswaterstaat (RWS),45 the Province of Limburg, and the Municipalities of 
Maastricht and Meerssen  –  on the one hand (‘the Project Agency’), and construction 
consortium ‘Avenue2’ on the other hand. The project replaces the former highway that 
divided the city. In addition, its construction is also used to instigate real estate develop-
ment, landscaping, and the reconstruction of nearby highway junctions. The construction 
formally started in 2011 and the commissioning of the tunnel is planned for the end of 
2016.
A total of eighteen open interviews with public and private managers of the A2 Maas-
tricht project were conducted between September 13, 2011, and December 6, 2011, by the 
first author of this article. In addition, multiple site visits, observations of project meet-
ings, project documents, and the website www.a2maastricht.nl facilitated interpreting the 
interview data. The interviews were transcribed and then coded and recoded in an iterative 
fashion (Boeije, 2010), using ATLASti coding software.

Rijkswaterstaat is the executive arm of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. On 
behalf of the Minister and State Secretary, Rijkswaterstaat is responsible for the design, construction, man-
agement, and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands (see www.rijkswaterstaat.
nl/​en).

Analysis
The analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we construct eighteen cases of management 
responses to unplanned events in the A2 Maastricht project (Section 4.4.1). Note that a 
case does not equal an interview; their number both being eighteen is a mere coincidence. 
Second, we compare these using mvQCA so as to find out which configurations of man-
agement responses and events produce (un)satisfactory outcomes (Section 4.4.2). Third, 
we explain these results in Section 4.4.3.
4.4.1.	
Case reconstructions of responding to unplanned events in the A2 
Maastricht project
Several attempts (i.e., iterations) at bringing operational closure are reported elsewhere. 
In what follows, we report our latest effort. Table 4.1 describes eighteen unplanned events, 
stemming from the project’s context during implementation, that we identified. As we 
focus in this article on how managers act, and because we focus on the implementation 
process, the table only concerns events after the contract closure  –  project construc-
tion – between principal and contractor in October 2009.
We constructed these cases as configurations of conditions. The first condition 
concerns the nature of the unplanned event. Contemplating Table 4.1, the nature of the

TUN
Tunnel standard
Due to ambiguity and hence discussions about the safety standards for Dutch 
tunnels and delayed commissioning of tunnels resulting there from, RWS established 
a Tunnel Director to develop a general tunnel standard to be anchored in legislation. 
At the time of interviewing, this caused uncertainty about changes in the technical 
traffic and tunnel system requirements and related rising costs of the systems.
BI1
Bicycle bridge
The plan was to create a temporary bicycle bridge to compensate the closure of two 
bicycle tunnels. A subcontractor identified problems with the design (i.e., sheared 
risks) that caused discussion within Avenue2 about how to proceed.
BI2
Bicycle bridge
In the end, this bridge was cancelled by Avenue2 for technical and safety reasons not 
foreseen in the procurement of the plan. Consequently, the Cyclist Union objected. 
The Union mobilized politicians in the municipal council – who appeared not to be 
informed of the change – who called the alderman to account.
WAT
Waterboarda
The Waterboard needed to issue permits for parts of the project. It imposed additional 
requirements related to water retention and drainage when a permit was applied for by 
Avenue2. This affected the project scope. According to several managers, this was due to 
not involving the Waterboard in the planning of the project.
LAN
Land acquisition
Over 400 apartments had to be purchased by the Municipality of Maastricht 
(Project Agency) to be demolished. A small number of residents objected, and some 
even appealed at the Dutch Council of State.b

ZON
Zoning plan
Leading up to the endorsement of the zoning plan by the Municipality of 
Maastricht, the content was agreed on by the responsible municipal manager and 
the manager planning of the Project Agency. However, as a consequence of internal 
municipal dynamics – inter alia, limited decision-making power of the municipal 
manager – the municipal manager reconsidered the agreements twice.
ENV
Environmentalists
Environmental interest group Kloar Loch appealed at the Council of State to enforce 
a higher air quality near the tunnel mouths in the final situation, and during project 
construction. Parallel to the legal procedure, the group also contacted the Project 
Agency to negotiate an agreement.
LEE
Leeuwenborgh
Vocational school Leeuwenborgh lodged an objection at the Project Agency to 
the phasing of a road bypass during construction for reasons of safety, health, and 
limited parking space.
WES
West8
In detailing the design of the project, the angle of a small tunnel relative to the 
highway was slightly altered by Avenue2 when they applied for the construction 
permit at the Municipality of Maastricht. Landscape architect West8 objected, 
mobilized inter alia the municipal Building and Housing Inspectorate, and 
demanded the undoing of the alteration.
RIJ
Rijkswaterstaat
RWS needed to verify the Route Decisions developed by the Project Agency.c 
Leading up to the endorsement, the content was agreed on between the Agency and 
RWS, but then RWS specialists demanded some changes in the design for reasons of 
air quality that would affect the project’s budget.
TRA
Traffic audit
During construction, RWS performed an unannounced audit concerning traffic 
measures. The audit judged that the measures taken by Avenue2 were insufficient 
and that unsafe situations existed.
CR1
Crisis
Part and parcel of the plan and Avenue2’s business case is the construction of 1,100 
houses and 30,000 m2 of commercial properties between 2016 and 2026. The 
financial and real estate crises caused uncertainty regarding the balance of the budget.
CR2

In the beginning of 2010, the Crisis and Recovery Act was enacted. This law aims to 
shorten procedures at the Council of State.
SOI
Soil contamination
During the reconstruction of the Geusseltvijver, soil contamination was discovered 
that was heavier than expected in the reports. By law, this contamination had to be 
removed.
BAD
Badger
Leading up to the contract closure, the local badger habitat was identified. After the 
contract closure, it appeared that the habitat had changed resulting in the need for 
scope changes (inter alia, badger tunnels).
PRO
ProRail
Decommissioning the railway near the project area is necessary for project 
construction purposes. When the Project Agency requested the decommissioning, 
ProRail acted obstructive as they felt passed over because they were not consulted 
about the issue during plan preparation.d

and BAD); in other cases, it primarily relates to the local social environment (i.e., BI2, 
LAN, ENV, LEE, and CIV), the project system (i.e., BI1 and WES), the local governance 
system including mother departments of the public partners (i.e., BI2, WAT, ZON, WES, 
RIJ, TRA, and PRO), or remote of the project (i.e., THE, TUN, CR1, and CR2). What 
sets the middle three categories apart is that these strongly relate to what Hertogh and 
Westerveld coin “social complexity” that is “prominently visible in the relationship be-
tween the project delivery organization and local stakeholders” and “between the project 
delivery organization and their principal and parent organizations” (2010:150). The first 
and latter categories could be said to be similar in that respect, but differ from one another 
in terms of their remoteness to the project. In sum, the first condition is broken down into 
five categories: physical, social, project, public, and remote (see Table 4.2).
The second condition concerns the way in which managers respond to the unplanned 
event. As can be seen from Table 4.2, they do so by focusing on their internal struc-
tures – for example, doubling the shifts, changing planning, and changing construction 
modes – or by (attempting to) engage with the social system, most prominently engaging 
with stakeholders, in which the project is embedded, or some combination of both. It 
is important to note here that not all the events are responded to by public and private 
managers; some are of concern to only one party. This is expressed in the third condition.
The third condition specifically concerns the relationship between the principal and 
contractor, which appeared to be a focal point in the interviews. This condition consists 
of two dimensions. First, an unplanned event may be responded to by either principal 
(public managers), or contractor (private managers), or both (i.e., interaction). This 
concerns the presence of public-private interaction. Second, if interacted on, this may 
be characterized, to greater or lesser extent, by either cooperation or conflict between 
principal and contractor, that is, join forces or, inter alia, shear risks. This concerns the 
nature of the interaction. Hence, four basic categories of public-private interaction can be 
distinguished: autonomous public, autonomous private, conflict, and cooperation. The 
empirical manifestation of the interaction is at least partly determined by the contract 
between principal and contractor that provides directions for how they are to interact.
The fourth and final condition concerns the ‘outcome’. In this, we follow Verweij, 
Klijn, Edelenbos, and Van Buuren (2013) to the extent that no unambiguous measure of 
‘good outcomes’ can be used in projects with multiple actors and interests. Moreover, the 
project was at the moment of interviewing in construction; that implies that outcomes 
are provisional, that is, that the final effect on the project outcome as a whole could 
not be established. For these reasons, we take as an aggregate measure the satisfaction of 
managers “based on their realized preferences and goals, and the time and energy spent 
achieving those” (Verweij et al., 2013:1038) in a case as the outcome, which predominantly 
concerns time, budget, quality, and/or the public-private relationship (Verweij, 2012a). 
For instance, if goals are realized but with much energy spent, satisfaction is assessed as 
moderately high. In the next section, the qualitatively described data in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 
are calibrated (see Table 4.3) and quantified in a data matrix (Table 4.4).

4.4.2.	 Comparing cases with mvQCA and results
The calibration rules for Table 4.2 are shown in Table 4.3. In the first mvQCA iteration, 
we used Version A of the calibration. However, as it turned out, this produced too many 
logical contradictions, that is, a configuration that is associated with the outcome in one 
case and with the absence of the outcome in another. In addition, Version A produced 
logical remainders, that is, logically possible configurations that are empirically absent. 
The more contradictions and remainders, the less there is to compare.
Specifically, first, EVENT{0} and EVENT{2} did not distinguish between cases in 
any significant way (i.e., it did not resolve a contradiction), but it did produce more 
logical remainders. That is, the remoteness of the unplanned event to the project does not 
account for the difference in outcome between cases. However, the difference between 
the social or nonsocial nature of the event distinguishes different cases from one another. 
Second, INTERA{1} (i.e., conflict) is empirically absent in our data, and two of the four 
contradictions could be resolved by distinguishing between ‘autonomous private’ and 
‘autonomous public’ interaction instead. That is, this first analysis with Version A of the 
calibration suggested that actions being performed either by the public or the private actor 
autonomously is possibly an important explanatory feature for assessing the satisfaction 
with how unplanned events were responded to. Following these first results, the calibra-
tion was adjusted to Version B (see Table 4.3). The data matrix resulting from Version B of 
the calibration is depicted as Table 4.4. In the remainder of the analysis, we proceed with 
this data matrix based on Version B.
In the next two steps, we organized the cases over the logically possible configurations 
in a truth table. Our truth table has twelve logically possible configurations (22 × 31). 
Each configuration is presented as a row. Each row can be understood as a statement of

be minimized to MAN{0}*INTERA{0}. Contradictory configurations are not included in 
this minimization process. The results are reported in Table 4.6.
4.4.3.	
Explanation of the results
The first solution formula [1] is associated with low satisfaction (see Table 4.6). It states that 
in six of the eighteen cases, irrespective of the nature of the unplanned event, internally-
oriented private management responses to events are associated with lower satisfaction. 
This is certainly the case for BI1, BAD, and TRA, where satisfaction was low. In the other 
three cases (THE, CR1, and SOI), where satisfaction is indifferent or moderate, this is 
less clear-cut. For those cases, it is reasonable to assume that those could not have been 
prevented by the contractor. This could explain the moderate or indifferent satisfaction 
expressed by managers in those cases. This may be different for the first three cases. We 
return to this issue in Section 4.5.2.
The second solution formula [2] consists of three terms [2A, 2B, and 2C] (see Table 
4.6). The first term [2A] indicates that in two cases, irrespective of the nature of the 
unplanned event, internally-oriented public management responses are associated with 
higher satisfaction. In the case of dealing with the environmental interest group Kloar 
Loch (ENV), the responsible public planning manager did not engage with the group 
during the legal procedure. He managed by the adage of “anything you say can and will be 
used against you in the court of law” (see Table 4.2). In the case of the Crisis and Recovery 
Act (CR2), this is a different story. Here, the unplanned event is remote to the project and 
the internally-oriented management qualification reflects this (see Table 4.2).
The second term [2B] indicates that a remote event, that is responded to internally-
oriented and in cooperation between principal and contractor, is associated with higher 
satisfaction. In this case (TUN), internal management strategies were oriented at an-
ticipating the impact of the future legislation on the project. This unplanned event was 
considered by the managers as a priority issue with a potentially large impact, which could 
not reasonably be left to Avenue2 to be dealt with. This was recognized by both partners, 
and this provided a basis for public-private cooperation.
The third term [2C] indicates that a social, local unplanned event (i.e., from the 
project system), that is responded to by externally-oriented private management, is associ-
ated with higher satisfaction. In this case of the objections raised by landscape architect

West8 (WES), some plan adjustments were made that resolved the issue without signifi-
cant delays or budget overruns. Although this finding is only formally supported by one 
out of eighteen cases, it is corroborated by the first solution formula [1] that states that 
when private managers do not engage with the social environment to deal with the issue 
(MAN{0}*INTERA{1}), this is associated with lower satisfaction.
Arguably, these three statements of sufficiency toward high satisfaction can be said to 
be empirically weak. That is, although they are consistent (i.e., there are no contradictions 
on the outcome between the cases covered by them), the terms in the second solution 
formula [2A-C] are covered by no more than two out of eighteen cases. There is a trade-off 
between consistency and coverage (e.g., Ragin, 2008a). Utilizing this trade-off to fortify 
the empirical strength of our results, we performed an additional mvQCA where we 
included the two contradictory configurations (see Table 4.5) in the minimization for 
SATIS{1}. Thereby, we increased the number of cases covered by the solution formula [2] 
by eight (higher coverage), and simultaneously the inconsistency as the added cases BI2, 
LAN, ZON, LEE, PRO, WAT, RIJ, and CIV do not all have a score of 1 on the outcome. 
However, only three of those eight cases do not score 1 (i.e., BI2, PRO, and WAT) and 
none of those three cases has a score in the lowest scores.
This additional mvQCA iteration produced somewhat similar results. The first [2A] 
and second terms [2B] of the second solution formula remained unchanged. However, 
the third solution term [2C], that was solely covered by WES, changed. It became more 
general as it does not matter whether interaction (INTERA) is autonomous public {0}, 
autonomous private {1}, or cooperative {2}; higher satisfaction is ‘produced’ nevertheless. 
Hence, the INTERA condition is dropped from the solution term to yield the more 
general result: EVENT{1}*MAN{1} → SATIS{1}. This means that externally-oriented 
management is an INUS condition, which means that it is necessary for dealing with 
social, local unplanned events, but that there are other combinations of conditions that are 
also associated with high satisfaction. This is indicated by the existence of the two other 
solution terms.

Conclusion and discussion
In Section 4.5.1, we conclude our analysis by answering the main research question. As 
announced in Section 4.2.2, in Section 4.5.2, we make a final interpretation of the results 
to conclude the analytical process, and in this discussion we point to some implications 
for managers of transportation infrastructure projects. Section 4.5.3 closes the article by 
briefly discussing some methodological issues and implications for evaluators.
4.5.1.	
Conclusion
In the introductory section, we set out to investigate how managers in the implementation 
phase respond to unplanned events that occur in the context of the transportation infra-

91
Chapter 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A2 project
structure project, and which management responses produce satisfactory outcomes. We 
adopted a research approach that combines qualitative in-depth analysis – which is needed 
to consider context that is explanatory for how outcomes come about in projects – with 
comparison – which is required to be able to draw lessons for future projects (cf. Verweij 
& Gerrits, 2013). We were able to show in a systematic way how the influence of certain 
management responses depends on its interaction with other conditions. Although such 
claims are expectedly also made in qualitative/interpretative case studies of transportation 
infrastructure projects, QCA allowed us to do this in a systematic and transparent manner. 
Using a grounded and iterative research process, we arrived at a number of results.
Specifically, we found that internally-oriented and externally-oriented management 
responses are associated with high satisfaction, but that this depends on the nature of 
the unplanned event, and/or on the cooperative relationship between principal (private 
managers) and the contractor (public managers). In particular, (a) internally-oriented 
private management is associated with lower satisfaction, (b) externally-oriented manage-
ment is associated with higher satisfaction in cases of social, local unplanned events, and 
(c) internally-oriented management is associated with higher satisfaction, depending in 
particular on the nature of the cooperation between principal and contractor. This shows 
that unplanned events are responded to in different ways and that balancing management 
strategies actually entails a mix of less balanced management responses within a project.
4.5.2.	
Discussion and management implications
We pointed at a difference between cases that are covered by the first solution formula 
associated with SATIS{0}. In all these cases, the unplanned event was responded to by the 
contractor, and satisfaction was rather low. This is not to say that when private managers 
deploy internally-oriented strategies, low satisfaction ‘automatically’ follows.
As mentioned in Section 4.4.3, regarding three of the six cases of this solution formula 
(THE, CR1, and SOI), managers expressed indifference in the interviews with respect 
to the outcome condition. They expressed that some events are just impossible to influ-
ence or prevent. The implication of this is not that managers should relinquish dealing 
with unplanned events, but rather that they should be aware that projects will inevitably 
encounter unexpected events (e.g., Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007).
In other remote unplanned events, the perceived potential impact on the project’s 
critical path (planning) was too great for the managers to remain indifferent to. This is 
most prominent for the development of the new tunnel standard (TUN). The need to 
anticipate this impact was felt by Avenue2 and the Project Agency; managers referred to 
the northerly A73 Roermond tunnel that is plagued by closures for safety reasons since its 
commissioning in 2008, resulting in limited regular service. With this bugaboo in mind, 
principal and contractor wanted to build a safe tunnel in Maastricht but not at the expense 
of construction delays and cost overruns. Indeed, the idea that the city has to endure the 
discomforts of the construction works beyond 2016 is deemed undesirable. It seems that

92
this shared sense of urgency is a strong driver for enhanced cooperation as it provided a 
basis for contractor and principal to cooperate in the project (cf. Verweij, 2012a).
Another possible condition underlying the differences within the first path associated 
with SATIS{0} may be the extent to which the contractor had a (too) strong focus on 
design and planning issues (BI1, TRA, and BAD). Encouraged to meet deadlines, contrac-
tors tend to focus on making rapid progress thereby sometimes losing sight of the local, 
social environment in which a project is embedded. This may backfire on the project’s 
process. The implication is that, generally, having an externally-oriented focus produces 
more satisfactory outcomes. This is supported by the results of our analysis. However, this 
does not seem a big issue in Maastricht as the project enjoys local support given its clear 
added value for the city and its citizens. But in more contested infrastructure projects, this 
may be a whole different story. This implies that support for a project is important for 
achieving satisfactory outcomes.
The second solution formula [2] indicates that internally-oriented management strate-
gies are sometimes associated with higher satisfaction (ENV, CR2, and TUN). Although 
the cases associated with these two configurations are quite diverse (see Table 4.2), they 
seem to have in common that they have a potentially large impact on the project’s develop-
ment. The TUN case was discussed above. For the ENV and CR2 cases, as public planning 
and procurement were interwoven (Van Valkenburg & Nagelkerke, 2006), and as the 
bidder was selected before the public planning was finished, changes in the public zoning 
and Route Decision plans may result in a failed procurement and high costs as the bidder 
was already selected. Hence, there was a big relief when the Council of State declared the 
public plans irrevocably.
The analysis also showed that externally-oriented management is strongly associated 
with high satisfaction and that the opposite is often the case for internally-oriented man-
agement. The obvious implication of this finding is that externally-oriented management 
responses are recommended to deal with unexpected events. However, it should be kept 
in mind that this could be concluded after including two logically contradictory con-
figurations. Bearing in mind that the contradictions are not very strong, the question of 
what explains these two contradictions remains. What the three cases with indifferent or 
moderate satisfaction (BI2, PRO, and WAT) seem to have in common, relative to the five 
other cases, is that managers expressed their satisfaction in terms of missed opportunities 
to involve particular actors in the planning of the project. Not involving ProRail (PRO), 
the Waterboard (WAT), and the Cyclist Union and municipal council (BI2), respectively, 
was perceived to have caused the unplanned event in the first place. This points us to the 
importance of closely involving stakeholders in the planning phase.
We showed that transportation infrastructure projects are implemented in a social 
context, and that this context gives rise to unplanned events. These events are often best 
managed not by ignoring them or managing inward, but rather by managing outward, that 
is, engaging with the social context of the project. This points us to the pivotal importance 
of stakeholder management, not just in the planning phases of a project but also during 
project implementation. In the A2 project, a lot of resources were allocated to this and 

93

with satisfactory results. The Project Agency and Avenue2 together run a communication 
office to provide local stakeholders, such as citizens, companies, and local governments, 
with information about (the progress of) the project. This is quite a success as there are no 
significant problems with stakeholder unrest during implementation.
4.5.3.	
Reflection on the method for evaluation
“QCA does not in itself open up the ‘black box’ of complex phenomena and processes. 
However, it rather acts like a flashlight that points at some crucial spots in the black boxes 
of the cases under investigation” (Rihoux et al., 2009:170). In this article, we illuminated 
some spots, but many remain to be studied. Nevertheless, we hope to have shown that 
QCA is a systematic and transparent evaluation approach that, on the one hand, appreci-
ates the uniqueness, diversity, and contextual nature of projects and, on the other hand, 
searches for patterns. This is imperative to transfer lessons from individual project analyses 
to future projects. We finish this article with some final points for evaluators.
First, in this article, we applied QCA to a single infrastructure project for in-depth 
analysis. However, it may also be interesting for evaluators to apply QCA to multiple 
infrastructure projects (e.g., Verweij et al., 2013) to compare small-n or intermediate-n 
projects across or within regions (e.g., states) and sectors. Given the fact that evaluators 
often have to deal with relatively small numbers of cases that makes statistical analysis 
difficult, this is a significant advantage of QCA. Second, the time dimension is under-
exposed in QCA approaches. In this article, we have carefully paid attention to time by 
constructing the cases in such a way that the unplanned event is chronologically prior to 
the other three conditions (MAN, INTERA, and SATIS) in each case. Moreover, time is 
also expressed in the qualitative interpretation. Nevertheless, QCA is an approach that 
is weak on researching the dynamics of infrastructure projects whilst these are pivotal to 
explaining outcomes (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). Third, we decided to work with mvQCA. 
This is arguably not the best method for any evaluation of infrastructure projects. What 
to use – csQCA, mvQCA, or fsQCA – ultimately depends on the conditions to include in 
the analysis and how these are operationalized. Crisp, multi, and fuzzy sets all have some 
distinct disadvantages and advantages (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012; Thiem, 2013; Vink 
& Van Vliet, 2009; 2013), as do the different software packages related to those methods 
(see www.compasss.org for an overview). Finally, through the iterative processes of data 
collection, coding, and casing, we arrived at a certain set of conditions to be included 
in the QCA process. Other projects with different characteristics, and other methods 
and techniques of data collection, may result in a different set of conditions. However, 
this does not invalidate in any way the usability of QCA for evaluating infrastructure 
development.

Achieving satisfaction when implementing PPP transportation 
infrastructure projects: A qualitative comparative analysis of the A15 
highway DBFM project

Abstract
This article investigates how managers in public-private partnership (PPP) projects re-
spond to social or physical events during the implementation of their projects, and which 
of their responses produce satisfactory outcomes. Multi-value qualitative comparative 
analysis (mvQCA) was used to examine the events that took place during a large Dutch 
Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain (DBFM) transportation infrastructure project. 
The analysis found that most events were social in nature. Private managers’ responses to 
these events were internally-oriented and resulted in dissatisfactory outcomes. In contrast, 
externally-oriented managerial responses were associated with satisfactory outcomes. The 
article concludes that both public and private managers need to invest sufficiently in stake-
holder management resources and capabilities when implementing projects. Although the 
intention of DBFM contracts is to lower the burden on the government, public managers 
still play an important role as intermediaries between the contractor and the local stake-
holders, and this role should not be underestimated.

Introduction
Over the last few decades, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have received increasing 
attention because they are thought to have many benefits (Bovaird, 2004). This is par-
ticularly the case with transportation infrastructure development (Kwak et al., 2009). 
Involving the private sector in infrastructure development is expected to have longer-term 
benefits, such as ‘value-for-money’ (Grimsey & Lewis, 2004; Kwak et al., 2009), and 
shorter-term benefits, such as a reduction in cost and time taken to deliver infrastructure 
services, higher quality service delivery, lower administrative costs, and the transfer of 
risks to the private sector (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003; Hodge & Greve, 2007; Kwak et al., 2009; 
Little, 2011). In the Netherlands, Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain (DBFM) contracts 
are often advocated (Committee PFI, 2008; Eversdijk & Korsten, 2009). These contracts 
resemble the U.K. Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects (Klijn et al., 2007). A DBFM 
contract is a specific type of PPP where the private partner is integrally responsible for 
designing, building, financing, and maintaining the infrastructure (Lenferink, Tillema, & 
Arts, 2013b). However, only few DBFM contracts have been implemented thus far (Klijn, 
2009) and research into them is scarce (Lenferink, Tillema, & Arts, 2013b).
Research into PPPs has mainly focused on the extent to which benefits are realized 
(research into the performance of PPPs) and how such benefits can be increased. Studies 
on increasing these benefits often examine pre-contract issues (Weihe, 2008b), such as 
tendering, procurement, risk allocation, and the financing of PPPs (Kwak et al., 2009). 
However, relatively little research has been carried out on the impact of the events that 
take place during the implementation phase of an infrastructure PPP, i.e., while it is being 
constructed and delivered (Jones & Noble, 2008), on project outcomes (Jones & Noble, 
2008; Mistarihi et al., 2013; Weihe, 2008b). During the implementation phase, managers 
are faced with a variety of challenges and delivery difficulties. These challenges and difficul-
ties often come to managers as events, stemming from the project’s socio-physical context 
(Love, Holt, Shen, Li, & Irani, 2002). How managers in a PPP respond to these events 
during project implementation is an important part of successful infrastructure develop-
ment (Love et al., 2002). For instance, an inappropriate response to an event may result in 
decreased shorter-term benefits such as delivery delays, lower delivery quality (leading to 
reputational damage or unsatisfied stakeholders), or poor relations between the public and 
private partners. Research, however, does not clearly specify which managerial approaches 
are the most beneficial for realizing satisfactory outcomes in PPP projects (Edelenbos & 
Klijn, 2009). The present study therefore aims to examine which managerial responses to 
events produce satisfactory outcomes during project implementation (cf. Verweij & Ger-
rits, 2015). The research question for the study is: how do managers in the implementation 
phase respond to events occurring in the context of PPP transportation infrastructure projects, 
and which management responses produce satisfactory outcomes?
This article is structured as follows. Section 5.2 describes transportation infrastruc-
ture project implementation, its implications for the research approach, and the applied 
research approach of multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA). Section 5.3

sets the empirical scene by introducing the Dutch A15 highway DBFM project, and the 
data collected about it. The data are analyzed in Section 5.4 using mvQCA. MvQCA has 
recently been suggested as a valuable method for evaluating transportation infrastructure 
projects (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013), though empirical applications are lacking. Sections 5.5 
and 5.6 comprise the discussion and conclusions, respectively.
5.2.	
Researching complex PPP transportation 
infrastructure projects
5.2.1.	
Properties of complexity in PPP infrastructure project management
Infrastructure projects are implemented in a socio-physical context where events occur 
(Gerrits, 2008; 2012; Van Gils, Gerrits, & Teisman, 2009). While these events are external 
to the project’s management (Söderholm, 2008), they can influence it, since projects are 
open systems (Engwall, 2003). Although “during implementation, projects are supposed 
[to] be as closed as possible and concentrated on execution according to plans” (Söder-
holm, 2008:83), events occur in the implementation of the project that require managers 
to respond to them. The events can have a physical basis, such as changing ground or 
weather conditions, or be rooted in a social issue, such as objecting stakeholders (e.g., As-
saf & Al-Hejji, 2006; El-Gohary, Osman, & El-Diraby, 2006; Odeh & Battaineh, 2002). 
This article’s focus on events that are experienced by managers in PPP projects during the 
implementation necessitates a grounded approach to identifying these events since they 
are experienced by the managers, not by a theory proposed by an evaluator.
Managers respond (i.e., adapt) to events to make them manageable (Van Gils et al., 
2009). Literature on the management of PPP projects distinguishes between project man-
agement and process management (Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008; Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). 
A central difference between them is their openness towards the environment. The first 
focuses on the internal organization of the project, while the latter emphasizes the project’s 
interaction with the societal environment. The first adheres to the idea of projects as closed 
systems and the second to projects as “contextually-embedded open systems” (Engwall, 
2003:790). Although research shows that managerial activities are crucial for successful 
PPPs (Klijn et al., 2008), Edelenbos and Klijn state that the literature is “ambivalent about 
what style is most beneficial for realizing outcome of complex decision-making processes, 
in particular public-private partnerships. (…). There has not been much attention paid to 
this issue, and empirical results are mostly absent” (2009:321). They conducted a survey 
on this topic and found that the externally-oriented style of management is positively cor-
related with good outcomes, while the internally-oriented style is not. Although this is a 
valuable finding, variable-oriented studies such as this do not explain how good outcomes 
are actually produced, in contrast to case-based research (cf. Klijn et al., 2008; Verweij & 
Gerrits, 2013). Klijn and colleagues speculate that managers actually “choose their manage-
rial strategy according to the logic of the situation” but they acknowledge that “this is a 

99
Chapter 5  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A15 project
theory that should be addressed through further research that focuses more on individual 
choices made by managers” (2008:271).
This article responds to this call and examines how managers respond to events in 
their day-to-day actions (cf. Cicmil et al., 2006; Smits, 2013; Van Marrewijk et al., 2008). 
Again, a grounded approach applies. The response chosen by a manager, and the complex 
processes leading to it (see Gerrits, 2012:Ch.4) are driven by the manager’s interpretation 
of the event and his assessment of how it is best dealt with. His interpretation, assessment, 
and consequent action(s) may be rationally bounded, but they are his, and they produce 
real outcomes (cf. Gerrits, 2012). It follows that management responses and outcomes can 
only be understood by taking the manager’s view as the point of departure.
While a transportation infrastructure project is being implemented, the management 
often faces multiple and different events. In a DBFM contract, where the private partner 
bears the responsibility for project implementation, private managers mainly respond to 
these events although the public partner may also be involved. Since responses to events can 
differ, it is possible to find many different examples of ‘management responses to events’ 
in a single project. Each example forms a separate case and each case is configurational 
(Byrne, 2005), which means that the event and the management response(s) combine to 
produce an outcome (cf. Van Gils et al., 2009).
The cases may be independent or intertwined with one another. For instance, cases 
may be linked to each other because of related events (e.g., a single stakeholder objects 
to different parts of the project for the same reason) or the involvement of the same 
individual/s. Additionally, these cases are also related because, ultimately, they are managed 
by the same overall contract between a principal and contractor. In sum, a transportation 
infrastructure project can be understood to consist of strings of cases, which comprise 
different combinations of similar elements. This implies that cases within a project exhibit 
both similarities and differences (e.g., Buijs et al., 2009).
5.2.2.	 Researching complexity in PPP infrastructure project management with 
mvQCA
Following the properties explained above, the research approach used for the present study 
consisted of three steps (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). The first step is the grounded collection 
of data. This was done by conducting open, qualitative interviews (e.g., Weiss, 1994): 
managers were asked what events had occurred, how they responded to them, and what 
outcomes had resulted. This allowed the researcher to obtain the manager’s view of the 
events, response, and outcomes. All the interviews were transcribed. The advantage of 
using interviews for data collection is that intangible aspects, such body language and tone 
of voice during the interviews, can be observed and used as cues for aiding interpretation, 
e.g., how satisfied an interviewee was with the outcome.
In the second step, the interview transcripts were qualitatively coded for events with 
ATLASti software. ATLASti is a tool for coding qualitative data (Friese, 2013). By coding, 
the different perspectives of managers are cross-corroborated. This facilitates the synthesis 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
100
of the different perspectives into case constructions per identified event although, due 
to the different tasks and responsibilities of the interviewed managers, not all transcripts 
contained information on each case. Qualitative coding is a process where codes are devel-
oped and can be revisited as the researcher interprets the data (cf. Schwartz-Shea & Yanow, 
2012). Using software such as ATLASti enables the researcher to structure and record this 
interpretive process, including the researcher’s considerations to code text in a certain way.
The third step is the application of the QCA method. QCA is an umbrella term for 
several subtypes, including mvQCA (Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a; Schneider & Wagemann, 
2012). QCA is a case-based comparative method. Being case-based, it allows researchers 
to emphasize the unique aspects of cases (i.e., their differences), while still allowing the 
identification of patterns (i.e., similarities) between them by comparing them (Ragin & 
Amoroso, 2011; Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). QCA is a method that facilitates an iterative 
process – of constructing cases as configurations of aspects, comparing the cases, inter-
preting the results, and possibly reconstructing the cases – in which (theoretical) ideas 
and empirical data are in dialogue with (i.e., inform) each other (e.g., Fritzsche, 2014). 
In QCA, the aspects of cases (here: events, management, and satisfactory outcomes) are 
called conditions. The advantage of mvQCA (Cronqvist & Berg-Schlosser, 2009) is that 
the conditions can have values beyond just 0 or 1, whilst remaining discrete (Vink & Van 
Vliet, 2009).
The basic logic of QCA consists of four subroutines (cf. Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). 
The first subroutine is the grounded qualitative construction of cases as configurations 
based on the coded interview transcripts (e.g., Rantala & Hellström, 2001). The cases 
are then quantitatively coded, and the configurations are placed in a data matrix. In the 
matrix, the cases are put in the rows and the conditions in the columns. The second 
subroutine is to reorganize the data into a so-called truth table, which sorts the cases over 
the logically possible configurations that are present in the data (Schneider & Wagemann, 
2012). The truth table is the key tool for the comparative analysis. Each row in the truth 
table can be read as a statement about whether the configuration represented in the row 
is ‘true’ (or not) for (i.e., associated with) the outcome. The third subroutine involves the 
pairwise comparison of configurations that have the same outcome but differ in one other 
condition. This process is called truth table minimization. The condition in which two 
configurations differ is said to be logically redundant because, irrespective of the value 
of that condition, the outcome is produced nevertheless. The research process from the 
first to the third subroutine involves shifting the focus from the differences between cases 
to the similarities between them. The second and third subroutines are performed with 
software so as to exclude the possibility of human error in the analysis of the truth table 
(Schneider & Wagemann, 2010). The Tosmana software (Cronqvist, 2011), instead of other 
QCA software, is used for the present analysis because it can be used for mvQCA. The 
fourth subroutine is to interpret the patterns that result from the truth table minimization 
so as to understand the management of the wider context which, in this study, is the A15 
highway DBFM project.

101
Chapter 5  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A15 project
Recall that going through these subroutines is an iterative process. For instance, if the 
truth table contains cases that agree on all the conditions (i.e., are of the same configura-
tion) and contradict on the outcome, this means that there is probably another condition 
at play that explains the contradiction. Conversely, if there are no contradictory cases in 
the truth table, the conditions might be further conceptually abstracted, or conditions 
could be excluded from the data matrix, so that even more general patterns can be identi-
fied. In this iterative process, the coded interview transcripts in ATLASti are regularly 
revisited.
5.3.	
Data collection about the A15 highway DBFM 
project
In the Netherlands, PPPs mostly occur in the areas of infrastructure and area development 
projects (Klijn, 2009). Many types of PPPs exist in infrastructure development (Grimsey 
& Lewis, 2004; Kwak et al., 2009; Little, 2011). The DBFM contract is one of them. It is 
a concessional type of PPP that closely resembles the DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, and 
Operate) or DBFMO (Design, Build, Finance, Maintain, and Operate) contract (Bult-
Spiering & Dewulf, 2006; Grimsey & Lewis, 2004; Yescombe, 2007). DBFM contracts 
are increasingly being applied in transportation infrastructure but experiences with, and 
research into, DBFM contracts is to date rather scarce (Lenferink, Tillema, & Arts, 2013b).
5.3.1.	
The A15 highway project
In December 2010, Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) entered into a DBFM contract, with a total 
project budget of approx. € 2 billion, with consortium A-Lanes A15 (see also Lenferink, 
Tillema, & Arts, 2013a; Verweij et al., 2014). RWS is the executive arm of the Dutch Minis-
try of Infrastructure and the Environment. It is responsible for the national transportation 
network. One of the main reasons for the project is the expansion of the Maasvlakte II 
port area. This has led to a need for extra transport capacity on the A15 highway corridor 
between the Maasvlakte II and the Vaanplein traffic junction near the city of Rotterdam. 
The general purpose of the project is to enhance traffic flow and safety on the corridor. 
Construction started in April 2011 and the project should be constructed in December 
2015. The project includes the design and build of about eighty-five km of additional 
traffic lanes, a dynamic traffic management system over the thirty-seven km length of the 
project area, the renovation of approximately thirty-six civil structures and the construc-
tion of twelve new ones, the renovation of two large tunnels, a new Botlekbridge, and the 
maintenance of the infrastructure system up to 2035. In the Netherlands, infrastructure 
maintenance is separate from its operation (Lenferink, Tillema, & Arts, 2013b). The opera-
tion remains with the relevant RWS road district.
Leading up to the contract closure, RWS closed an administrative agreement and ad-
herent implementation agreements with fourteen (semi-)public stakeholders: the national 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
102
Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, the regional collaboration Metropolitan 
Region Rotterdam, the regional Province of South-Holland, the Municipality of Rotter-
dam, seven other smaller municipalities and boroughs of Rotterdam, the local Waterboard 
Hollandse Delta, the Port of Rotterdam Authority (HbR), and national railway network 
manager ProRail. The underlying idea was to have consensus with these actors beforehand 
so as to smooth the project delivery. RWS incorporated the implementation agreements 
into the DBFM contract.
In the construction phase of the project, the RWS project organization consisted of 
a small team headed by five managers, of which the contract manager and stakeholder 
manager are dominant. The consortium A-Lanes A15 is formed by four companies: three 
construction firms and a project developer/investor. They are the constituent members of 
the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which has a DBFM concession contract with RWS. 
The SPV is a ‘virtual organization’ responsible for the design, build, finance, and mainte-
nance of the infrastructure system for which it receives income (Grimsey & Lewis, 2004; 
Ng & Loosemore, 2007; Smyth & Edkins, 2007) consisting of two large payments – one 
at partial availability and one at availability of the infrastructure system – and availability 
fees during the whole course of the contract up to 2035. The SPV uses contracts secondary 
to the concession contract (Ng & Loosemore, 2007) to finance the project, i.e., short- 
and long-term loans from banks, and to design, build, and maintain the project, i.e., 
contracts with two joint-ventures that both consist of the three construction firms. The 
first of the two joint-ventures is the EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) 
organization that is responsible for designing and managing the project (including the 
relationships with the stakeholders of the project) in the construction phase. The second 
joint-venture is responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure system during and 
after the construction phase of the project.
5.3.2.	 Data collection
A total of twenty interviews were conducted between May 2012 and January 2013: seven 
interviews were with RWS project managers and thirteen interviews with A-Lanes’ direc-
tors and project managers. Three managers would not be interviewed. The distribution of 
interviews reflects the dominant position of A-Lanes in the implementation phase of the 
project. Additional site visits, document reviews, and website inspections were used to 
further interpret and understand the interview data and results of the analysis.
5.4.	
Analysis
This section comprises the third step as explained in Section 5.2. As mentioned before, the 
analysis was an iterative process, and the fourth section here reports the final results of this 
process. Section 5.4.1 discusses the first subroutine: the identification of the events, the re-
sponses of the project’s managers, and the results of their responses. These configurational 

103
Chapter 5  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A15 project
cases are reorganized and compared in Section 5.4.2, which covers the second and third 
subroutines. At that point, the project’s complexity and diversity have been systematically 
channeled into a few general patterns, which substantiate our understanding of the proj-
ect’s management more broadly. This represents the outcomes of the fourth subroutine, 
and they are interpreted in Section 5.4.3.
5.4.1.	
Case constructions of responding to events in the A15 highway DBFM 
project
Table 5.1 provides an overview of the events that were identified. For instance, in one case, 
citizens complained about the noise nuisance that was produced when construction took 
place at night. Many citizens were not made aware of the potential for noise nuisance from 
construction activities if a northeast wind arose. In another case, ProRail changed the 
choice it had made in the implementation agreement, and which had been agreed upon by 
the other parties involved in the project, for a certain type of rail system. A final example 
from Table 5.1 is the discovery of an explosives risk zone with WWII bombs.

CAB1
The project area is packed with cables and pipelines. RWS is responsible for moving the so-
called ‘category-1’ cables and pipelines – prior to project implementation – and A-Lanes for 
moving ‘category-3’ ones. During implementation, it appeared that a set of combined category-1 
and -3 units near the Aveling secondary road had to be moved after all to be able to widen the 
A15 highway, which necessarily required coordination with the cable and pipeline owners and 
stakeholders (such as the Municipality of Rotterdam).

Citizens complained about the noise nuisance produced by the nightly construction works (esp. 
pile driving) near the Botlekbridge. Due to an uncommon, unanticipated northeast wind, especially 
many complaints came from uninformed Spijkenisse citizens.
CIT2
After A-Lanes informed citizens about the pile driving work plan near the Groene Kruisweg 
provincial road that would produce about 70 dB, the Albrandswaard citizens asked for work 
methods and plans that would produce less noise nuisance.
CIT3
About 50 citizens complained about the noise nuisance produced by the nightly pile driving near 
the Verlengde Zuiderparkweg, upon which the Borough of Charlois decided to make the piling 
works stop by threatening to withdraw the necessary permit.
CIT4A
Uninformed Barendrecht citizens complained about the noise nuisance produced by the 
construction works (i.e., sand transportation and pile driving at night) at the Vaanplein highway 
junction. Hence, the Municipality of Barendrecht demanded to be timely and correctly informed 
about A-Lanes’ activities.
CIT4B
Since the Municipality of Barendrecht was unsatisfied with the communication by A-Lanes and 
the quality of the permit applications regarding the Vaanplein construction works – which should 
include apt information and substantiation about the construction activities – it rejected the 
applications. Also, citizens still complained about the nuisance.
DOW
A downpour near the Groene Kruisweg Viaduct caused a small flood that washed away intentionally 
deposited sand where a land abutment would be built.

Brief description
EXP
In a nearby project commissioned by the Municipality of Rotterdam, an explosives risk zone was 
discovered through a standard so-called NGE-investigation into unexploded WWII explosives. 
The results of the investigation contradicted the previous NGE-investigation for the A15 highway 
project. Consequently, owners of Pipeline Corridor-2 demanded additional NGE-investigations for 
the A15 highway project.
GRO
The ground conditions near Pipeline Corridor-1 appeared more problematic than expected. During 
the piling works, the ground moved thereby exerting too much pressure on the cables and pipelines 
in the corridor.
HBR1
It was agreed upon by RWS and the HbR that the latter would become the owner of the new 
to be built Oudeland Viaduct by A-Lanes. When A-Lanes finished the design according to 
the requirements in the contract with RWS, the HbR – backed-up by the Municipality of 
Rotterdam – demanded changes in it. They did not accept the design. Respondents felt that the 
HbR “find fault with everything” after the HBR3 case.
HBR2
When A-Lanes announced that it would start with reconstructing the Welplaatweg and Hartelkruis 
junctions, and simultaneously redirecting the hazardous substances route via the Welplaatweg, the 
HbR objected that the Welplaatweg could not be both reconstructed and serve as the reroute.
HBR3
Motivated by the contract to make a good pace, A-Lanes constructed a temporary road for 
transporting hazardous substances without coordinating the design with the HbR as they were 
required to by contract. Consequently, the HbR objected and did not give its approval for the road.
LEI
LSNed, the organization responsible for managing and maintaining the pipeline corridors, 
demanded changes in the design of the Pipeline Corridor-1 overarch. This was unexpected as RWS 
did not close an implementation agreement with LSNed.
MUN1
The Municipality of Rotterdam objected to the designs of Ramp700 (a land abutment for the 
Botlekbridge) as it would make future access to certain cables and pipelines impossible. The 
Municipality felt that the design did not meet the requirements agreed upon in the implementation 
agreement.
MUN2
The Municipality of Rotterdam repeatedly did not give its approval for the construction of the 
Botlekbridge pillars as it was unconvinced that the designed pillars were strong enough to carry the 
weight of the bridge decks.
PRO
After the contract award, ProRail reconsidered its implementation agreements with RWS. ProRail 
wished another technical rail system on the Botlekbridge than previously agreed upon, because the 
then foreseen novel system appeared more susceptible to interference than anticipated.
PRV1
The Province of South-Holland objected to the position of a particular cable near the Groene 
Kruisweg Viaduct as it would make it impossible for the Province to build a road parallel to the 
Groene Kruisweg in the future.
PRV2
After the deal with the Province was made about the solution of PRV1, a work foreman announced 
to the A-Lanes stakeholder manager that he would commence the implementation. When the 
stakeholder manager passed this to the Province, it objected because it first had to check and 
formally approve the solution, i.e., no permit was issued yet.
RWS1
The RWS Traffic and Water Management directorate (DVS) demanded changes in the design of the 
Portland traffic changeover as they thought the current design to be not safe enough.
RWS2
The RWS road district objected to the positioning of a site office by A-Lanes under a flyover near the 
Vaanplein junction for safety reasons (i.e., fire hazard) and wants the site office to be moved.

Chapter 5  |  Management and public-private cooperation in the A15 project
Each of the cases in Table 5.1 is constructed in the qualitative analysis as a configura-
tion of conditions (see Section 5.2). As can be seen in Table 5.2, each case consists of four 
conditions. We explain them below.
The first condition (EVENT) concerns the nature of the event, which can be either so-
cial or physical. Social events originate from stakeholders, i.e., the social context. Physical 
events originate from the physical (natural) system. This distinction is relevant because it 
implies different situational logics which, in turn, could be followed by different manage-
ment responses. That is, anticipating or responding to physical events is second nature to 
construction firms, which specialize in project organization/planning and dealing with 
physical systems. On the other hand, dealing with social events suggests a more open 
or externally-oriented management response (cf. Edelenbos, Klijn, & Kort, 2009), with 
which the construction sector is generally less familiar. In the A15 project, the lower level 
of familiarity is indicated by, inter alia, respondents saying so, and the relatively fewer 
means allocated to communication and stakeholder management, which private managers 
pointed out. The difference between a more internally-oriented response, such as doubling 
shifts or changing construction modes in an attempt to control planning and the budget, 
and an externally-oriented management response, such as engaging with stakeholders to 
achieve or maintain good rapport with them, is captured by the second condition: MANA.
The third condition (MANR) concerns the involvement of RWS’ management. It is 
relevant to include this as respondents indicated that both the principal and the contrac-
tor, being relatively inexperienced with DBFM, were still discovering how management 
tasks and responsibilities are best distributed. A preliminary analysis of the interview 
transcripts revealed that, in some cases, RWS acted as an intermediary between A-Lanes 
and local stakeholders in order to safeguard good project outcomes, while in other cases 
RWS cooperated with A-Lanes. In yet other cases – ‘in the spirit of DBFM’ – RWS did not 
act as a manager. This triple option requires that mvQCA is used over other types of QCA.

The focus of A-Lanes was on 
finding a technical solution to 
the problem that all stakeholders 
could agree with.
Their respective obligations 
to move cables and pipelines 
made RWS decide to 
combine the actions to 
be implemented, and to 
coordinate with stakeholders 
together.
This case was excluded 
from the requirements for 
the large multi-million 
payment, and a solution 
satisfactory to stakeholders 
was found.
CIT1
Social
A-Lanes decided to start actually 
measuring noise production to 
validate its model upon which 
it was basing its communication 
policy towards citizens.
As RWS is concerned with 
being a ‘public-oriented 
network manager’, the 
stakeholder manager started 
to renegotiate the 50 dB 
limit at which A-Lanes was 
required to inform citizens.
The 50 dB limit to inform 
citizens about construction 
works near the Botlekbridge 
was adjusted to 45 dB.
CIT2
Social
A-Lanes reconsidered its work 
plan which led to an approx. 
two-thirds reduction of nightly 
construction works. Additionally, 
it offered hotel stays to citizens 
that would be affected still.
There is no indication that 
RWS was involved in this 
particular case.
Only one or two complaints 
were received, and there 
were no problems with 
obtaining the needed 
permits.
CIT3
Social
The focus of A-Lanes was on 
choosing another method so as 
to continue construction.
There is no indication that 
RWS was involved in this 
particular case.
Construction was delayed 
for a week, extra costs 
were incurred, the media 
got wind of it, and RWS 
was dissatisfied with the 
situation.
CIT4A
Social
The focus of A-Lanes remained 
on achieving quick results, and 
not on high quality stakeholder 
informing through, inter 
alia, producing good permit 
applications.
RWS did not facilitate or 
cooperate at this point (but 
see CIT4B). It even said to 
the Barendrecht alderman to 
just reject the application.
RWS was dissatisfied with 
the situation, and the 
Municipality of Barendrecht 
rejected permit applications.
CIT4B
Social
The focus was still primarily on 
achieving results within time 
and budget; information about 
building activities came too late 
to be included in a newsletter.
RWS stepped forward, i.e., 
it gave A-Lanes a reprimand 
and started checking 
communication means by 
A-Lanes.
There was some progress 
regarding the Vaanplein 
case, but communication by 
A-Lanes remained an issue.
DOW
Physical
The focus of A-Lanes was 
on repairing the physical 
situation and on improving the 
collaboration between two sub 
joint-ventures.
There is no indication that 
RWS was involved in this 
particular case.
A hard shoulder had to be 
resurfaced.
EXP
Physical
The additional investigations 
were carried out by the 
Municipality of Rotterdam. 
A-Lanes had to redo its work 
preparation and increase working 
speed.
This was the contractor’s risk; 
RWS was not involved in this 
case although A-Lanes did 
seek support.
Costs were incurred for the 
delay and hitherto RWS 
seemed unwilling to share 
(part of) the risks or costs.

The construction method was 
changed. When it turned out 
that this did not help, piling 
works were stopped.
There is no indication that 
RWS was involved in this 
particular case.
Costs were incurred (but 
managed by moving the 
piling works to the other 
pipeline corridor), and no 
solution was yet found.
HBR1
Social
RWS was asked for help in 
this case as A-Lanes felt that 
it met all the requirements. 
Additionally, construction plans 
were reconsidered as delays 
were anticipated. Also, some 
efforts were made to better the 
relationship between A-Lanes 
and the HbR.
RWS stepped forward and 
mediated between A-Lanes 
and the HbR. An external 
consultant was called in and 
RWS sided with A-Lanes in 
this case.
The construction was 
delayed and costs were 
incurred. Managers 
expressed tiredness with this 
issue and A-Lanes was still 
at odds with the HbR.
HBR2
Social
A-Lanes involved eight 
stakeholders, including the 
HbR, in a deliberation process to 
determine the best solution for 
the rerouting problem.
There is no indication that 
RWS was involved in this 
particular case.
A solution was found that 
satisfied all stakeholders, 
save the Municipality of 
Spijkenisse, i.e., rerouting 
via the Hartelkruis.
HBR3
Social
The actions of A-Lanes were 
focused on just getting this 
case over with; the focus was 
certainly not on building a better 
relationship with the HbR.
RWS was on the same footing 
as the HbR and told A-Lanes 
that the road could not be 
commissioned until A-Lanes 
would substantiate the design 
and get approval from the 
HbR.
This case was the first to set 
the scene for the difficult 
relationship between 
A-Lanes and the HbR 
that tormented A-Lanes 
constantly.
LEI
Social
As no implementation agreement 
was available, LSNed had 
neither interest nor contractual 
responsibility to cooperate. 
Management was aimed at 
getting LSNed to cooperate.
After a request for assistance 
by A-Lanes, RWS wrote an 
implementation agreement.
Costs were incurred, but the 
implementation agreement 
made it possible that LSNed 
recovered some costs from 
RWS.
MUN1
Social
The focus of A-Lanes was on 
quickly finding a technical 
solution to the problem, but it 
failed to align its interpretation 
of the requirements with those of 
the Municipality.
RWS intervened as it was 
unclear whether A-Lanes was 
to blame for the situation 
or whether the contract 
contained a contradiction. 
RWS tried to make A-Lanes 
and the Municipality to better 
cooperate with one another.
Delays had occurred and 
it was yet unclear when 
construction could start. 
Moreover, the relationship 
between A-Lanes and the 
Municipality was damaged. 
Also RWS was unsatisfied 
with A-Lanes’ performance 
in this case.
MUN2
Social
The focus of A-Lanes was on 
finding a technical solution 
to the problem that the 
Municipality could agree with. 
Simultaneously, the final design 
for the bridge was not awaited, 
and ordering steel for the bridge 
continued so as to limit delays; 
and the construction planning 
was revised.
There is no clear indication 
that RWS was involved in 
this particular case, although 
A-Lanes started informing 
RWS about the slow acting by 
the Municipality.
The construction of the 
Botlekbridge pillars was 
delayed with several 
months, and costs were 
incurred in the ordering 
process for the Botlekbridge.

The fourth and final condition concerns the outcome (SATIS). Managers have dif-
ferent backgrounds, tasks, and responsibilities, leading to differences in how they deal 
with events and what sorts of outcomes mattered to them. The respondents articulated 
different types of outcomes, such as local stakeholder satisfaction, being on-time, being 
within-budget, and product quality. For comparative purposes, however, only one out-
come condition is included: the aggregate, multidimensional condition of ‘satisfaction’ of 
managers with how the event was dealt with (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015).
Tables 5.3 and 5.4 comprise the qualitative construction of cases as configurations, and 
the quantitative coding of these constructions in a data matrix, respectively. The meaning 
of the coded conditions in Table 5.4 is provided in Table 5.2. For instance, in the above-
mentioned ProRail case, which is coded as a social event (EVENT{1}), A-Lanes responded

Initially, according to the RWS 
contract manager, A-Lanes 
responded to ProRail by 
starting a process to explore the 
possibilities to satisfy the wishes 
of ProRail.
RWS intervened by making 
ProRail responsible for all 
the costs that a design change 
would cause. This case first 
had to be resolved between 
RWS and ProRail before 
involving A-Lanes, although 
A-Lanes acted as a ‘consultant’ 
to RWS.
RWS appreciated the 
proactive effort of A-Lanes. 
The case was still ongoing, 
but it was clear that A-Lanes 
was not responsible for 
solving this issue and thus 
possible costs involved.

A-Lanes’ stakeholder manager 
made a deal with the Province to

Social
The A-Lanes stakeholder 
manager engaged in a

RWS was involved in this

A deal was made that 
satisfied all actors: the 
foreman could start his 
work, and in return A-Lanes 
would asphalt a bicycle 
path unrelated to the A15 
highway project.
RWS1
Social
The preference of DVS 
corresponded to a previous 
design that was abandoned as 
it scored low on traffic flow. 
A-Lanes clarified that reverting 
to the previous design would 
increase costs, leading to a new 
reconciliation processes with 
stakeholders. The solution was 
to make some small changes in 
the design.
There is no clear indication 
that the RWS project 
organization was involved in 
this particular case.
In the end, the 
commissioning of the 
new traffic lanes was 
delayed, and a claim by 
A-Lanes towards RWS to 
compensate for costs was 
rejected.

A-Lanes initially reacted 
dismissively but offered a new 
solution to the road district.
RWS discussed the issue with 
A-Lanes during a meeting and 
advised the contractor how to 
deal with it.
Costs were incurred for 
moving the site office.

by engaging with ProRail (MANA{1}). Also, RWS intervened by making ProRail finan-
cially responsible for the design change that it wished for, thus acting as an intermediary 
between A-Lanes and ProRail (MANR{1}). Although this case was still ongoing when the 
interviews were conducted, it was clear that A-Lanes would not have to bear the costs for 
any design changes, and RWS appreciated the proactive effort by A-Lanes to engage with 
ProRail (SATIS{1}).
In QCA, the numerical scores (Table 5.4) of the qualitative descriptions (Table 5.3) 
allow the cases to be compared transparently. The coding process, where ideas and data 
informed each other, involved both tangible and intangible data. The first three conditions 
are quite tangible as respondents were asked about what empirically happened and how 
they acted (cf. Verweij, 2012a). Describing and scoring the cases on the outcome condi-
tion relied on more intangible cues, such as body language and tone of voice during the 
interviews, as the respondents were sometimes reticent to explain their position in this 
respect (see Section 5.2.2).

5.4.2.	 Comparing cases with mvQCA and results
After constructing the data matrix (Table 5.4), the next step in a qualitative comparative 
analysis is to reorganize the data into a truth table (Table 5.5). Our truth table has twelve 
logically possible configurations (22 × 31): two conditions have two possible values and 
one condition has three possible values (see Table 5.2). Only the six empirically present 
configurations are shown in Table 5.5. The table shows that there are three configurations 
associated with satisfactory outcomes and three with unsatisfactory outcomes.
The next step is to minimize the truth table, i.e., to compare configurations that 
agree on the outcome and differ in but one condition. For instance, if we take the 
fourth and fifth rows of Table 5.5, configurations EVENT{0}*MANA{0}*MANR{0} 
and EVENT{1}*MANA{0}*MANR{0} can be minimized into the more generalized 
MANA{0}*MANR{0}. That is, logically speaking, whether EVENT is {1} or {0}, the out-
come SATIS{0} is produced nevertheless. Note that the second and third rows in Table 
5.5 cannot be minimized because the configuration EVENT{1}*MANA{1}*MANR{2} is not 
present in the data. This also applies to the fifth and sixth rows because the configuration 
EVENT{1}*MANA{0}*MANR{2} is absent. The results of the comparison are depicted in 
Table 5.6.
In order to arrive at more general patterns for both SATIS{0} and SATIS{1}, the condition 
MANR was abstracted in the next iteration from a multi-value condition into a binary condi-
tion (see Section 5.2.2). Consequently, the number of logically possible configurations changed 
from twelve (22 × 31) to eight (23). This means that the empirical coverage of the logically 
possible configurations increased from six out of twelve to six out of eight, meaning that more 
pairs of configurations would agree on the outcome and differ in but one other condition. The 
advantage is that the results of the minimization are more general (i.e., less minimal configura-
tions which are comprised of less conditions), making interpretation easier. The results of the 
new iteration in the comparison are depicted in Table 5.7. It could be argued, on the downside, 
that this implies a conceptual abstraction into ‘RWS is either present {1} or absent {0} as a 
manager’, and the way in which RWS is involved (the previous MANR{1} and MANR{2}) is 
irrelevant. However, because CAB1 (the only case with MANR{2}) individually constitutes a 
configuration (see Table 5.6), this abstraction can easily be accounted for in the next section.

5.4.3.	
Explanation of the results
As shown in Table 5.7, there are two minimized configurations associated with higher 
satisfaction. The first configuration is represented by case CAB1. It is an odd one out as it is 
covered by just one case. RWS and A-Lanes responded to the physical event by cooperat-
ing to find a solution. They had separate financial responsibilities for dealing with different 
types of cables and pipelines (see Table 5.1) but, because these were physically intertwined, 
it made sense to work together. The second configuration was covered by seven cases 
and stated that an externally-oriented response by A-Lanes to social events was associated 
with a high level of satisfaction. In some of these cases, RWS acted as an intermediary 
between A-Lanes and local stakeholders, while in other cases A-Lanes managed to respond 
satisfactorily without any intervention by RWS.
Two minimized configurations are associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. In nine 
cases, most of which involved meeting deadlines and getting things built in line with 
the project plan, encouraged by the structure of the DBFM contract, A-Lanes’ managers 
responded to social events with internally-oriented policies. This meant that the interests 
of local stakeholders, such as citizens (CIT3, CIT4A, CIT4B), municipalities (MUN1, 
MUN2), and other (semi-)public actors (RWS1, RWS2, HBR1, HBR3), were not catered 
for. As shown in Table 5.3, this resulted in stressful relationships with those stakeholders, 
delays, and/or costs. For instance, in case CIT4A, RWS was dissatisfied with the response 
of A-Lanes’ managers to citizens’ complaints, and the relevant municipality rejected permit 
applications by A-Lanes. The other minimized SATIS{0} configuration is represented by 
seven cases and indicates that, irrespective of the nature of the event, A-Lanes’ managers 
acted autonomously and responded with internally-oriented actions. Some of these cases

were about social events and are also covered by the previous configuration. The other 
three are physical events (DOW, GRO, EXP). RWS was absent due to the fact that the 
events were the contractor’s risk. Respondents indicated that costs were incurred as a 
consequence. Whether the SATIS{0} cases will impact the longer-term benefits remains 
to be seen.
The majority of the cases (sixteen out of twenty) involve events that had a social basis 
(see Table 5.5). A closer look at the coded interview transcripts revealed that some of those 
cases were related to one another. This applies to two clusters of cases, shown in Table 5.8. 
The first concerns the CIT cases. Citizens complained about the nuisance of construction 
work (CIT3, CIT4A), which led to the Municipality of Barendrecht eventually rejecting 
permit applications (CIT4B). The initial autonomous internally-oriented responses by A-
Lanes did not result in better outcomes, as can be seen in Table 5.8. In cases that occurred 
later, RWS became an intermediary in the process by checking (CIT4B) and renegotiating 
(CIT1) A-Lanes’ stakeholder communication policy and channels. In the most recent 
case (CIT2), A-Lanes’ managers responded with an externally-oriented action, and RWS 
did not become involved. Higher satisfaction was associated with these latter cases. The 
pattern here is that more satisfactory outcomes were achieved when RWS temporarily 
intervened but stepped back later, after which A-Lanes used externally-oriented manage-
ment autonomously. In terms of Table 5.8, the CIT cases are related clockwise through 
time.
The second cluster of cases concerns the HBR cases. A pattern similar to the CIT 
cases occurred here. The HBR3 case occurred not only because of A-Lanes’ desire to make 
headway, but also because of its failure to improve the relationship with the HbR (see 
Tables 5.1 and 5.3). The relationship deteriorated to the point that A-Lanes managers felt 
that the HbR “found fault with everything”, impeding the construction process (HBR1, see 
Table 5.1). At some point, contra the rationale of the DBFM contract according to which 
the principal is minimally involved, RWS stepped forward to manage the relationship 
between A-Lanes and the HbR. In the most recent HBR2 case, satisfactory outcomes were 
produced and RWS was not involved: A-Lanes autonomously organized a deliberative 
process with stakeholders to find a solution to an objection of the HbR, which resulted in 
a solution that satisfied all stakeholders (see Tables 5.1 and 5.3).
This pattern explicates what several respondents underlined: although construction 
companies may not by nature be attuned to societal complexity, they are learning how

Discussion
5.5.1.	
Discussion of the results
The main purpose of this article was to investigate how managers respond to events in the 
implementation of PPP transportation infrastructure projects, and which management 
responses produced satisfactory outcomes. The results show that most cases (sixteen out of 
twenty) involved social events. In nine of these sixteen cases, the contractor responded with 
internally-oriented management; in the other seven cases, it responded with externally-
oriented management. The results indicate that, for the A15 highway DBFM project, social 
events that are responded to by managers with externally-oriented actions are associated 
with satisfactory outcomes, while internally-oriented management responses are associ-
ated with unsatisfactory outcomes. This confirms the research findings of Edelenbos and 
Klijn (2009). The analysis also highlights the importance of the principal’s involvement in 
the implementation phase of the DBFM project.
What then do these results tell us about the role of management in the implementa-
tion phase of the DBFM project? First, the prevalence of social events over physical events 
resonates with the argument of Aaltonen and Sivonen that “stakeholder related conflicts 
and incidents are among the most significant unforeseen risks in projects implemented in 
challenging environments” (2009:131). Second, the analysis shows that in the implementa-
tion, the primary focus of the contractor is on project activities so as to meet deadlines (cf. 
Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008) since exceeding those results in missing periodic payments 
by RWS, which negatively impacts the financial status of the project. Third, however, the 
contractor is dependent on the project’s stakeholders for making progress in the imple-
mentation of the project. According to the concession contract, the contractor first needs 
to get the design requirements from the stakeholders, such as the municipalities and the 
HbR, after which it can design and plan the project’s construction, which in turn has 
to be coordinated with the stakeholders. Only then can it start constructing the various 
elements of the project. These stakeholders have their own interests, and their internal 
processes are organized at their own pace. This means that, to a large extent, the contractor 
is dependent on the capacitance and willingness of the stakeholders. This dependency 
requires externally-oriented management. However, the same contract also encourages 
the contractor to deliver high-quality transportation infrastructure in a cost-efficient and 
rapid way. These are the main reasons for governments to use public-private partnerships, 
and to achieve this, the contractor is put at an arm’s length from its principal so that he 
can deploy its skills as a project manager. During the implementation of the project, 
both management orientations are important, but the A15 highway DBFM project seems 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
114
to have had more of an internal orientation (cf. Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008). It seems 
that the contractor had not yet fully developed the management skills to deal with social 
events satisfactorily. Fourth, the study showed that RWS’ involvement as an intermediary 
in the relationship between the contractor and the project’s stakeholders was important 
for achieving more satisfactory outcomes. This means that the DBFM contract is not, in 
the words of some of the private managers, a “Bahamas contract” where the principal is 
totally unburdened.
The present study responded to the call in the literature to have more insights into what 
happens in the implementation phase of PPP projects (Jones & Noble, 2008; Mistarihi et 
al., 2013; Weihe, 2008b), and DBFM projects in particular (Klijn, 2009; Lenferink, Til-
lema, & Arts, 2013b), although, of course, the findings of the study cannot be generalized 
to other DBFM projects. Our analysis suggests that, during the implementation phase, 
contractors are inclined to focus on project activities, instead of engaging with stakehold-
ers, and that the DBFM contract encourages this particular orientation. However, these 
are as of yet suggestions that need to be corroborated with more comparative research.
5.5.2.	
Reflection on the method
This study also contributes to the literature on the evaluation of infrastructure projects. 
While QCA has recently been suggested as a valuable method for this field, actual applica-
tions of it still lack (cf. Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). The mvQCA analysis conducted here 
indicates several pros and cons of this approach. The main advantage is that QCA is a 
systematic comparative approach that allows a simultaneous focus on the differences and 
similarities between cases, thus striking a balance between paying attention to the unique 
aspects of cases and the identification of patterns. One implication of the configurational 
nature of QCA is, however, that different conclusions may be arrived at if a single case is 
added. Indeed, the three managers of the A15 highway DBFM project that would not be 
interviewed could have pointed at additional cases of events. If those cases represented 
(an) additional configuration(s), the minimization of the truth table would produce dif-
ferent results. However, for the present study this effect is probably not too problematic 
since the interviews showed that the rate of increase of the number of events introduced by 
the respondents was declining. Also, with the exception of one configuration, the coverage 
(by cases) of the minimized configurations is quite strong. Another issue is that mvQCA 
requires that conditions are simplified into a few possible values. However, this may not 
be appropriate for more granular activities. For example, the activities of managers in 
responding to events are more complex than the distinction between being internally- or 
externally-oriented. To deal with this, future applications of QCA could adopt the fuzzy-
set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) subtype. The advantage of fsQCA is that 
more fine-grained scales, rather than just 0 or 1, can be used (Ragin, 2008a), although these 
scales may be more difficult to develop in grounded approaches. Finally, only a limited 
number of conditions can be included in a QCA: because the number of logically possible 
configurations increases exponentially with the number of conditions, the possibilities for 

115

pairwise comparing cases decrease. This could be solved by adding more cases, although 
there are practical limits to the number of cases that (a) researcher(s) can manage to study.
5.6.	
Conclusion
The analysis and discussion are by no means intended to criticize the management of 
A-Lanes. For one thing, other important aspects, such as the decision processes involved 
in the management responses, could provide more insights into the thinking behind the 
choice to respond to events in an internally-oriented fashion. Also, the intention is not 
to judge the final performance and longer-term outcomes of the project: the interviews 
are a snapshot, and at the time of the interviews the project was still being implemented. 
These aspects need to be addressed in future research. The implication of the present study 
is that, whereas policy-makers, at least in the Netherlands, tend to (over)emphasize the 
potential benefit of DBFM to unburden government, construction companies may have 
not yet fully mastered the ability to manage relationships with local stakeholders that 
comes with this type of PPP. In procuring future DBFM projects, public managers may 
do well to recognize the stakeholder management capabilities of construction companies, 
as well as their own roles as intermediaries between stakeholders and the contractor in the 
process of implementing a DBFM project.

Implementing public-private partnerships: How management responses to 
events produce (less) satisfactory outcomes

Abstract
Most research on public-private partnerships focuses on the (pre-) contract phase. The 
phase after contracting has received less attention. However, sound agreements and good 
intentions can easily fail in the implementation phase that follows contracting. This is 
often due to the occurrence of unforeseen events and ineffective management responses 
to them. Based on two qualitative comparative studies of two large infrastructure PPPs, 
within which thirty-eight event-response-outcome combinations were identified, we 
found that externally-oriented responses and a cooperative stance produce satisfactory 
outcomes. In practice, however, management responses are often internally-oriented and 
non-cooperative, which results in less satisfactory outcomes. This article presents evidence 
for these patterns, explanations for them, and it indicates how implementation managers 
in PPPs can achieve satisfactory outcomes.

Introduction
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are about cooperation between governments and busi-
nesses (Selsky & Parker, 2005). Despite their debatable performance (Hodge & Greve, 
2007; 2009), PPPs are becoming a prevalent practice (Bovaird, 2004; e.g., OECD, 2012). 
This is also the case for infrastructure projects (Kwak et al., 2009; Little, 2011). PPPs are 
expected to result in efficiency and quality gains, value-for-money, reduced pressure on 
government budgets (Kwak et al., 2009), and less delays and cost overruns in project 
delivery (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003; Little, 2011). However, these expectations are not always 
met. Jooste and Scott (2012:150) state that “the international experience of infrastructure 
PPP implementations has not been perfect” and Hodge and Greve (2007:545) hence argue 
that “despite their continuing popularity with governments” PPPs have to be studied and 
assessed “away from the policy cheerleaders”. This article fits in that line of argumentation. 
Relatively new, however, is its focus on the implementation phase.
We know that the conceptual variegation of the PPP concept (Hodge & Greve, 2013; 
Klijn, 2010; Weihe, 2008a) gives rise to different forms and interpretations. Generally, 
however, a PPP can be defined as an enduring contractual relationship between two or 
more partners, of which at least one is a public body, in which both public and private 
partners bring some kind of resources (e.g., money, property, authority, knowledge) to the 
partnership, and in which responsibilities and risks (e.g., financial, economic, social) are 
shared for the purpose of delivering public infrastructure-based products and/or services 
(cf. Grimsey & Lewis, 2004). Literature reviews (Ke et al., 2009; Kwak et al., 2009; Tang 
et al., 2010) show that amongst the main researched issues are the formation of PPPs 
(e.g., Koppenjan, 2005), procurement, tendering, PPP finance, and risk allocation. These 
are mainly pre-contract phase issues. As Weihe, amongst others, found: “what happens 
after contracts have been signed […] has received [less] scholarly attention” (2008b:154). 
Scholars indicated that PPP implementation is a relatively under-researched topic (Jones 
& Noble, 2008; Mistarihi et al., 2013; Weihe, 2008a; 2009). Researchers studying the 
management of PPPs (e.g., Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008; Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Klijn 
et al., 2008) also tend to neglect the implementation phase of projects. Sound PPP project 
preparations, however, can easily be wasted during implementation. This article focuses 
on PPP implementation, and more specifically on management responses to unforeseen 
events.
Implementation starts after the negotiations between the partners are concluded in a 
contract. It is about the execution of a contract “in the form of infrastructure construction 
and/or service delivery” (Jones & Noble, 2008:109). In PPP implementation towards com-
pletion, public and private managers are confronted with a variety of unforeseen events, 
originating from the dynamic socio-physical context of PPP implementation (Mistarihi et 
al., 2013; Söderholm, 2008). Scholars on PPP management argue that literature is ambigu-
ous about which kinds of management responses produce better outcomes (cf. Edelenbos 
& Klijn, 2009). It is assumed that managers choose strategies according to the ‘logic of 
the situation’. How to pinpoint this logic is, however, still an unsolved research question

(Klijn et al., 2008). Our focus will be on ‘unforeseen events’ in “inherently unpredictable 
worlds” (March, 1994:36). We assume that these constitute obstacles for reaching satisfac-
tory outcomes in project implementation (Müller-Seitz & Schüßler, 2013; Söderholm, 
2008; cf. Van Gils et al., 2009).
We will focus on the relationship between management responses to unforeseen events 
and satisfactory outcomes: (1) how do public and private managers respond to unforeseen 
events during implementation and which management responses produce satisfactory outcomes, 
and (2) how can it be explained that unforeseen events are often not responded to in these ways? 
This question is answered by comparing and building upon the results of two case studies 
of two Dutch transportation infrastructure PPP project implementations, in which thirty-
eight events were systematically and comparatively analyzed (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015; 
Verweij, 2015a). Our previous studies focused on the first part of the research question; 
this article focuses on the second part.
Sections 6.2 and 6.3 provide a substantive and empirical background of the case 
studies. We will elaborate the concepts of unforeseen events, management, and high and 
low satisfactory outcomes. We will also present a brief sketch of the two infrastructure 
PPP implementations that are compared in this article: the A2 Maastricht and the A15 
Maasvlakte-Vaanplein (MaVa). The research approach that was applied is presented in 
Section 6.4. Section 6.5 summarizes and compares the relations between the thirty-eight 
events, the management responses to them, and the outcomes in the two implementation 
processes, thereby addressing the research question. Section 6.6 articulates the implica-
tions of our findings for the management of PPP implementation.
6.2.	
The nature of PPP
PPPs in infrastructure emerge in various shapes and sizes (e.g., Kwak et al., 2009). Within 
the general definition presented above, scholars differentiate between concession and 
alliance models (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Koppenjan, 2005). In the first model, the 
“PPP takes the form of a turnkey project in which a private party designs, finances and 
constructs a public sector project” (Koppenjan, 2005:137). Alliances, in contrast, involve 
cooperation between public and private parties throughout the whole (implementation) 
process. Although both types involve contracts between public and private organizations 
and the monitoring of compliance, the alliance model is said to put less emphasis on 
contracts (Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008).
6.2.1.	
Unforeseen events
Implementation is challenging. It has to be achieved in dynamic socio-physical contexts 
in which unforeseen events will occur (Gerrits, 2012; see also Müller-Seitz & Schüßler, 
2013; Van Gils et al., 2009). Unforeseen events often have an impact on implementation 
(Söderholm, 2008). PPP projects are no exception; they are not context-independent 

121
Chapter 6  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
‘islands’ (Engwall, 2003) but rather open instead (e.g., Papadopoulos, 2012; cf. Dimitriou, 
Ward, & Wright, 2013). Naturally, contingency plans are drafted in order to deal with 
dynamical contexts. These plans are “repositories of expectations on which managers build 
their daily activities” (Söderholm, 2008:81). They help managers to focus and they guide 
their actions. By the same token, plans also ‘neglect expectations’ as they cannot foresee 
all possible future eventualities. There are limits to predictive and planning capacities, no 
matter how much information is analyzed (Gerrits, 2012). Consequently, some events will 
be unforeseen (cf. Söderholm, 2008), thus challenging implementation managers.
The extent to which an event is unforeseen depends on the position of project planners 
and managers. Events even can be unforeseen by one person and expected by someone 
else (cf. Rescher, 1995). This does not diminish their potential disruptive effect on imple-
mentation, as long as those working in project implementations did not recognize its 
coming. Unforeseen events are non-stochastic and out of reach of contingency planning, 
because – contrary to planning for stochastic events in terms of risks – the likelihood of 
their occurrence is unknown and undetermined. They could not be anticipated, even in 
the realm of contingency planning.
It is useful to distinguish between two categories of unforeseen events (Van Gils et 
al., 2009). Events can originate from physical sources, like unstable ground conditions. 
They can also originate from social sources, such as dissatisfied stakeholders (e.g., citizens, 
municipalities, or other governmental organizations) or changing laws and regulations. 
Aaltonen and Sivonen (2009:131) argue that “stakeholder related conflicts and incidents 
are among the most significant unforeseen risks in projects implemented in challenging 
environments.” During implementation, stakeholders are mostly concerned with “the in-
fluence of construction activities on their daily routine activities and life style” (El-Gohary 
et al., 2006:596). It can be expected that unforeseen events from social sources will need 
specific managerial responses (cf. Allison, 1983; Ring & Perry, 1985).
6.2.2.	 Management responses to unforeseen events
Managers often respond to the events by trying to control them or to keep them outside 
‘their implementation trajectory’ (Van Gils et al., 2009). This is one of the responses we are 
going to elaborate. Drawing on the PPP management literature (e.g., Edelenbos & Klijn, 
2009; Klijn et al., 2008), this response is identified as an internally-oriented focus on the 
project. It is rooted in traditional management models focusing on “structure, administra-
tive systems and the execution of plans” (Söderholm, 2008:81). It is related to ‘project 
management’ characterized by a closed, project-inward orientation. The emphasis is on 
speeding up implementation, mainly by explaining and promoting the project interest. 
The management persists on achieving pre-determined goals despite unforeseen events. 
Communication takes a DAD-strategy (decide, announce, and defend).
Alternatively, an externally-oriented response can be applied, emphasizing interaction 
with the societal environment (cf. O’Toole, Meier, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2005). This re-
sponse relates to ‘process management’ approaches (De Bruijn, Ten Heuvelhof, & In’t Veld, 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
122
2010). It is characterized by an outward orientation, aiming to create or maintain support 
for the project implementation. Possible solutions are sought together with stakeholders. 
The management is receptive and flexible towards unforeseen events, and communication 
takes a DDD-strategy (dialogue, decide, and deliver). Because of its stakeholder-oriented 
nature, this response can be applied to social events (see, e.g., Edelenbos et al., 2009).
The other dimension of the management response concerns the way public and pri-
vate partners are involved in the response. We discern three possibilities. Some events are 
responded to by the public partner; others are responded to by the private partner. This 
depends on how risks and responsibilities are perceived and allocated in the PPP. A third 
option is that the partners develop a joint response (Jones & Noble, 2008; Verweij & 
Gerrits, 2015).
6.2.3.	 Satisfactory outcomes
Management responses to events produce outcomes. The most common variables for 
measuring project outcomes concern measures such as efficiency and value-for-money. 
They, however, can hardly be used in situations wherein projects have not yet reached their 
stage of delivery and exploitation. Nevertheless, managers will need to assess the quality 
of the implementation process (cf. Kärnä et al., 2013; Lehtiranta et al., 2012). Indicators 
like stakeholder satisfaction, incurred costs, time schedule, partner’s behavior, and the 
perceived quality of mutual relations, can serve as next bests (cf. Atkinson, 1999; Jeffares, 
Sullivan, & Bovaird, 2013). We therefore used self-reported ‘managers’ satisfaction’. This is 
a measure of which the importance is increasingly recognized as a way to assess the quality 
of the implementation process, as it captures the heterogeneous nature of what constitutes 
successful implementation (cf. Dimitriou, 2014; Kärnä et al., 2013; Lehtiranta et al., 2012). 
We distinguished between low and high satisfaction.46
6.3.	
Infrastructure PPPs in the Netherlands
The concessional form of Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain (DBFM) contracts is 
promoted in the Netherlands (e.g., Committee PFI, 2008) and in the U.K. Private Fi-
nance Initiative (PFI) (Klijn et al., 2007). The number of projects fitting this framework 
is increasing. To date, however, not many of them have been realized (see Committee 
PFI, 2008; Klijn, 2009; Ministry of Finance, 2012). In this article, we use the data about 
the Dutch DBFM project A15 MaVa. The alliance model is less promoted by the national 
government. In this article, we use the data about the alliance-like project A2 Maastricht.
46	
Others additionally have argued that satisfaction is also a key factor for final project performance (Kärnä et 
al., 2013; Leung, Ng, & Cheung 2004).

Chapter 6  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
6.3.1.	
Two PPP transportation infrastructure projects
The A2 Maastricht project has an alliance-like model. It involves the construction of a 
2.3 km tunnel underneath the city of Maastricht on the A2 highway corridor, combined 
with real estate development and landscaping, and the rearrangement of adjacent high-
way junctions. Partners are the Dutch highway authority Rijkswaterstaat, the Province 
of Limburg, the Municipalities of Maastricht and Meerssen, and the private consortium 
Avenue2, wherein the companies Strukton and Ballast Nedam participate. The imple-
mentation started with a Design and Construct (D&C) contract, which was signed in 
2009. The execution is planned to be finished in 2017.47 Rijkswaterstaat sponsors € 564 
million; the other three public partners contribute € 144 million, including plots for real 
estate development (Ministry of I&M, 2013). The development of real estate is expected 
to cover ten percent of the execution costs (about € 70 million) (Lenferink, Tillema, & 
Arts, 2013a). The private partners have to recoup a substantial part of their investments 
from selling this real estate. An unusual expression of the alliance approach is that the 
public and private project organizations are housed in the same building. They even run 
a joint department responsible for the communication with various local stakeholders 
(Projectbureau A2 Maastricht, 2012; Verweij, 2012a).
The A15 MaVa project is a DBFM contract. It involves the extension of the 37 km 
highway corridor from the Rotterdam port area ‘Maasvlakte’ to the ‘Vaanplein’ cross-
ing in the Rotterdam highway ring. Its scope encompasses the application of a traffic 
management system, 85 km of highway lanes, a new Botlekbridge, and the renovation 
and reconstruction of civil works (e.g., flyovers, tunnels, and bridges) on the corridor. The 
implementation partners are Rijkswaterstaat and the construction consortium A-Lanes 
A15, consisting of Strukton, Ballast Nedam, John Laing, and Strabag. The DBFM contract 
was signed in 2010. The construction is to be finished in 2015; the maintenance contract 
will last until 2035.48 The budget is nearly € 2,000 million (Ministries of I&M, EL&I, 
& BZK, 2012); the construction costs are about € 1,400 million (Lenferink, Tillema, & 
Arts, 2013a). The opportunities for a viable business case are in the financial constructions 
between A-Lanes A15 and its funders, and in lifecycle optimization, which should gain the 
concessionaire some profits. Contrary to Maastricht, the relation between A-Lanes A15 
and Rijkswaterstaat is concessional. The emphasis of Rijkswaterstaat is on monitoring the 
performance of A-Lanes A15 with regard to availability, quality, and stakeholder satisfac-
tion. Based upon this, A-Lanes A15 receives availability fees that co-finance the project.

6.4.	
Research approach
6.4.1.	
Data collection
The main data of the case studies comes from open qualitative interviews conducted with 
public and private senior project managers and directors. Eighteen interviews with four-
teen respondents (average: 80 minutes) were conducted for the A2 project from September 
to December 2011. Twenty interviews with seventeen respondents (average: 77 minutes) 
were conducted for the A15 project from May 2012 to January 2013. All interviews were 
recorded and fully transcribed. This data collection was performed by the researcher.
This method was used for two reasons. First, unforeseen events cannot be identified 
beforehand through some evaluator’s predefined theory (cf. Van Marrewijk et al., 2008). 
Events have to be identified by asking interviewees in an elaborative way (e.g., Weiss, 
1994). Second, managers’ responses to events they face have to be detected by asking 
how they responded and how satisfied they were with the outcomes, instead of filling out 
pre-defined categories. The abovementioned categories (Section 6.2) were formed in a 
grounded way through the analysis (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015).
6.4.2.	 Data analysis
The data analyses consisted of several steps. First, the interviews were qualitatively ana-
lyzed with ATLASti coding software: the transcripts were coded for the events, including 
management responses and satisfaction as reported by the respondents. Determining the 
unforeseen nature of an event, and the relationship between events, management, and 
satisfaction, was substantiated in ATLASti. The second step concerned cross-comparing 
the interviews per event identified, which was facilitated by coding in ATLASti. This 
resulted in eighteen (A2 Maastricht) respectively twenty (A15 MaVa) combinations of 
unforeseen events, management responses, and outcomes. The relational patterns between 
the three elements were reported qualitatively in earlier publications (Verweij & Gerrits, 
2015; Verweij, 2015a).49 These thirty-eight events were analyzed as embedded cases within 
the two project cases. Subsequently, the categories presented earlier were developed from 
these cases and linked with literature.
Third, multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (Cronqvist, 2004; Cronqvist & 
Berg-Schlosser, 2009; Cronqvist, 2011), often abbreviated as QCA, was applied. QCA 
is a configurational approach (Fiss, 2007). It provided a systematic method to compara-
tively analyze the thirty-eight events. Its configurational nature highlights combinations 
of management responses to events. QCA understands the event cases as configurations 
of aspects (i.e., the source of the event, the nature of the management response, and the 
public-private cooperation), and then compares empirically present configurations that 
agree on the outcome (i.e., satisfaction) and differ in just one aspect. This was done sepa-

Additional triangulation with other data sources, such as project-​internal management documents, was not 
possible. These sources were not made available.

125
Chapter 6  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
rately for each project case. The aspect in which two configurations were different could 
be considered redundant for explaining the outcome. E.g., if two configurations have 
high satisfaction, and one concerns a social event with an internally-oriented management 
response where the private partner acted autonomously, and the other also concerns a 
social event where the private partner acted autonomously but with an externally-oriented 
management response, then we infer that the response (internally- or externally-oriented) 
is not needed for explaining satisfaction: the private actor’s autonomous responses to 
social events produce low satisfaction. This comparative process resulted in patterns of 
management responses associated with satisfaction or dissatisfaction with how the event 
was responded to.
These patterns are presented in Table 6.1 (see also Verweij & Gerrits, 2015; Verweij, 
2015a). In this article, we will build upon these patterns, trying to explain them by com-
paring the two project cases.
6.5.	
Patterns and explanations for achieving 
satisfactory outcomes
We present two examples of the patterns summarized in Table 6.1 (see for a complete 
overview: Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). In one case, the Municipality of Rot-
terdam (a local stakeholder) disapproved the Botlekbridge pillars construction (event 
from a social source). A-Lanes A15 responded by searching for technical solutions, to 
maintain project speed (internal response), by itself (private actor acts autonomously). 
The Municipality disapproved again, resulting in delays and extra costs. Whether this will

eventually result in further cost overruns and delays remains to be seen. Crucial for us is 
that the involved managers were dissatisfied with the costs and delays (low satisfaction). 
In another case, A-Lanes A15 also responded internally and autonomously, also resulting 
in low satisfaction, but it concerned a situation where the ground conditions nearby an 
underground pipeline street were worse than expected (event from a physical source). Both 
cases represent pattern B in Table 6.1.50 The table summarizes the results of the comparison 
of the event-response-outcome combinations. It presents two patterns associated with low 
satisfaction (patterns A and B), and four with high satisfaction (patterns C, D, E, and F). 
It also shows that events are more often satisfactorily responded to in the A2 than in the 
A15 project implementation.
Next, the results are explained and interpreted by comparing the projects. Patterns 
that complement each other are presented and discussed together. Section 6.5.1 focuses on 
the nature of the management response and Section 6.5.2 focuses on the public-private 
cooperation.
6.5.1.	
Internally- and externally-oriented management in responding to social 
events
There are two important findings on the management response. Pattern F indicates 
the strong relation between social events, externally-oriented management, and higher 
outcome satisfaction. Pattern A indicates the strong relation between internally-oriented 
management of social events and lower satisfaction. The two are contrasts, indicating 
externally-oriented management as effective responses to social events. These findings 
corroborate research by Edelenbos and Klijn (2006; 2009), who found that management 
approaches that emphasize flexibility, openness, and interaction with the societal environ-
ment, result in more satisfactory outcomes than approaches that stress the execution of 
projects according to plans, specified goals, and contractual relations, and that tend to 
develop a more internal orientation. The A2 project’s management responses were more 
often externally-oriented: in nine out of eighteen events the management responses were 
externally-oriented. In the A15 project, seven out of twenty responses were externally-
oriented (pattern F in Table 6.1).
The first explanation for this difference between the two project cases concerns the 
difference in time pressure experienced. Several managers in the A15 experienced time 
pressure in the implementation. Instead of ‘being in control’ they regularly felt ‘lived by’ 
the project’s dynamics. The private A15 project director talked about impending budget 
overruns. Under conditions of (perceived) time pressure, engaging in interactive processes 
with stakeholders (externally-oriented management responses) feels as time-consuming. 
Under these conditions, managers aim for quick solutions within their reach (internally-

An empty cell in this table means that the aspect is ‘unnecessary’ for explaining the outcome. For instance, 
the empty cell in the column ‘source of the event’ of pattern B indicates that the pattern ‘internally-​oriented 
management and a private actor responding autonomously’ is associated with low satisfaction, irrespective 
of the event’s source.

oriented). For example, when the Municipality of Rotterdam did not approve the con-
struction design of the Botlekbridge pillars, being unconvinced of the pillars’ strength for 
carrying the bridge decks (social event), A-Lanes A15’s management response aimed to 
minimize the effect(s) of the event on the project planning by finding a technical solution 
to the problem and ordering steel for the bridge (internally-oriented response), although 
the Municipality had not yet approved the design. This response generated financial risks 
and low satisfaction. In another case, A-Lanes A15 constructed a temporary road for trans-
porting hazardous substances without coordinating the road design (internally-oriented) 
with the Port of Rotterdam Authority (another local stakeholder). Later, the Authority 
disapproved the road which generated low mutual satisfaction.
The A2 Maastricht project provides a contrasting picture. In interviews, the private 
project director showed confidence in progress towards completion. The interviewed 
managers exhibited less signs of stress and time pressure. At the same time, quite a lot of 
time was spent on engaging with stakeholders after a social event occurred. For instance, 
when a local vocational school objected to the phasing of a road bypass during construc-
tion (social event), an elaborate informal negotiation process with the school was started 
(externally-oriented response), resulting in the cancellation of the school’s objection and 
the maintaining of good rapport between the school and the project organization (high 
satisfaction). The responses to unforeseen social events in the A2 project were often 
externally-oriented. The managers recognized the importance of stakeholders and invested 
in the relationships with them. This comparison of the two projects indicates that time 
pressure reinforces internally-oriented responses which, in the occurrence of social events, 
often results in dissatisfactory outcomes.
The time pressure explanation can also be found in the literature (cf. Edland & Sven-
son, 1993). When managers experience time pressure, they draw boundaries in attempts 
to reduce the complexity of implementation. Information is filtered and ignored (Edland 
& Svenson, 1993), which allows managers to ‘ration attention’ (March, 1994) so as to get 
‘in control’. This simplification is inherent to coping with unforeseen events (Gerrits, 
2012; Van Gils et al., 2009). When time pressure increases, focused approaches aiming 
to get control over implementation are attractive to choose. However, when the societal 
environment is excluded in responding to an unforeseen event, stakeholders’ interests and 
influence can be overlooked. They can then come back to the managers later on at higher 
costs. If so, the internally-oriented management response is actually becoming ineffective.
A second explanation for more external oriented responses in the A2 project concerns 
the organization of stakeholder involvement. This can be explained from the different 
project scopes (see Verweij et al., 2014). The A2 is about inner-city infrastructure develop-
ment. It benefits the citizens of Maastricht regarding traffic safety, environmental quality, 
and traffic congestion. Local actors, such as the municipalities, citizens, and businesses, 
were facing the negative externalities during implementation (e.g., noise nuisance and 
limited accessibility during construction), but also the possibilities of prospective rev-
enues, e.g., more safety and environmental quality, and less traffic congestion. The project 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
128
was not only about connecting A to B; it was about regaining city qualities. This way of 
framing seems to be crucial.
The Municipality of Maastricht was partner in the PPP, and was committed to involv-
ing local stakeholders in planning, procurement, and implementation. Local stakeholder 
platforms and citizens had a say in deciding on which project bid would win, and during 
implementation stakeholders were actively informed about and involved in the project.
In contrast, the A15 MaVa project is not intended nor presented as regional develop-
ment. It was ‘just’ an improved connection between A and B. This creates no support 
amongst local stakeholders. This also tends to reinforce internally-oriented approaches 
in which stakeholders are external to the project. Nearby residents and municipalities 
experienced negative externalities during implementation, without positive effects in the 
future.
In addition to this, the applied concession model created an indirect relation between 
private management and stakeholders. Stakeholders do have implementation agreements, 
but with the procurer Rijkswaterstaat. These agreements were included in the DBFM 
contract between Rijkswaterstaat and A-Lanes A15. Rijkswaterstaat assumed that they had 
transferred their relationships with stakeholders to A-Lanes A15, who is responsible for 
implementation (see Verweij et al., 2014).
Local municipal authorities were also at arms-length of the implementation. They 
were not able to translate stakeholder issues into the project. The issues only found a way 
out through external events. After citizens complained (to their own municipality) about 
noise nuisance, the municipality forced A-Lanes A15 to stop pile driving works. In the 
A2 project, it seemed that internalizing local stakeholder interests into the partnership 
allowed for proactive and attuned joint actions.
This comparison suggests that in projects with a broader scope of transportation 
and urban development, where multiple stakeholders are involved in implementation, 
stakeholder interests are better served, creating also satisfactory outcomes for the imple-
mentation managers themselves.
The effectiveness of stakeholder involvement can also be found in the literature, where 
it is emphasized that involvement is important because actors whose interests are harmed 
can easily block or hinder implementation (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2006; Koppenjan & Klijn, 
2004). Whereas that literature implies that less unforeseen social events may occur when 
stakeholders are effectively involved, recent research (Verweij et al., 2013) additionally 
shows that stakeholder involvement, combined with an externally-oriented management, 
results in satisfactory outcomes.
6.5.2.	
Public-private cooperation in responding to events
Table 6.1 presents four patterns that indicate public-private cooperation in response to 
events: patterns B, C, D, and E. These patterns generate additional information and 
knowledge. Pattern B states that internally-oriented responses by a private partner result 
in low satisfaction. Patterns C, D, and E, however, indicate that internally-oriented 

129
Chapter 6  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
management can result in high satisfaction. This is an important and intriguing finding. 
Satisfaction requires that the public partner is also involved in responding to the event.51 
Governments can compensate a private internal orientation.
These findings indicate that joint public-private actions in response to unforeseen 
events result in higher satisfaction. Joint action may mitigate the internally-oriented 
response of one of the partners (cf. Jacobson & Choi, 2008; Mistarihi et al., 2013).
The two project cases show a quite different relationship between the public and pri-
vate partners. In the A2, signing the contract was perceived as the start of actually working 
together. In the A15, signing the contract was perceived as the moment of transferring 
responsibilities and risks from the public to the private partner. The public actor was only 
prepared to play a partnership role as intermediary between A-Lanes A15 and stakeholders 
in the environment (pattern E in Table 6.1), and only after the tension between project 
and stakeholders got high (see also Verweij, 2015a).
In both projects, the private partners were primarily concerned with maintaining a fi-
nancially viable business case. Projects have to be realized within time and budget, accord-
ing to quality standards contractually agreed upon. In the A15 project, the business case 
strongly depends on fees that will be received after the project’s construction is finished. 
In the A2 project, the business case depends on the possibilities of urban development on 
top of the new tunnel. This also creates sensibility for the city.
In both projects, the public partner Rijkswaterstaat followed a businesslike, formal 
approach. This was reflected in Rijkswaterstaat’s role perception in the PPPs, which mainly 
concerned contract monitoring and project control. In the A2 project, however, the man-
agers from the municipality applied another approach and were able to compensate the 
Rijkswaterstaat way of working. These managers were much more socio-politically oriented 
and not only focused on contract monitoring and project control. The A2 project direc-
tor had a longstanding career as manager and director of urban development projects in 
Maastricht, and the project’s stakeholder manager was in close contact with the Maastricht 
alderman. The municipal managers brought to the partnership local ways of working, 
characterized by open and informal relationships with private partners. The cooperation of 
local (municipal) and national (Rijkswaterstaat) public managers created a project culture 
with a unique and joint set of norms, values, and principles tending towards partnership 
(Verweij, 2012a). According to respondents, the open and informal public-private partner-
ship culture in the A2 project was also instigated by the proximity of the public and private 
management: they were housed in the same building. Whereas the informal relationship 
and the proximity were regularly stated in the A2 Maastricht interviews as success factors 
for implementation, in the A15 MaVa interviews, in contrast, the businesslike (formal), 
tense, and remote nature of the relationship was stressed (see also KING, 2009).
51	
Note that pattern C could be considered an ‘odd one out’ as these situations did not actually concern project 
implementation events, but pre-​contract events. This can be explained by the particular planning process of 
the A2 Maastricht project, where procurement and public planning were intertwined (see Van Valkenburg 
& Nagelkerke, 2006). Given our definition of project implementation (see Section 6.1), because the PPP 
contract was closed before public planning procedures were finalized, the two events were included in the 
analysis.

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
130
This partnership culture explanation is also found in the PPP literature, often by refer-
ence to the two PPP models that underlie the projects. Scholars argue that the concessional 
model (found in the A15 project) “is not a real partnership because co-production is lim-
ited, risk-sharing is absent, and relationships are purely contractual” (Weihe, 2008b:157). 
The argument is that the strict demarcation between public and private actors, anchored 
in contracts, discourages co-operation. So, the advantages of not blurring different value 
systems (Jacobs, 1992), by which public and private sector actors are governed (cf. Ring & 
Perry, 1985), can easily become a hindrance for stakeholder involvement and externally-
oriented approaches. This is also an intriguing finding. In the alliance model, the demarca-
tion between the partners is less strict, generating fears about corruption by some, but also 
facilitating satisfactory cooperation in implementation. Governments are more intensively 
involved, taking care of public interests after unforeseen events emerge (Edelenbos & 
Teisman, 2008).

Conclusions and discussion
6.6.1.	
Conclusions
How do public and private managers respond to unforeseen events in implementation? 
Which management responses produce more or less satisfactory outcomes? And what can 
explain these patterns? These are the questions we set out to answer in the introduction of 
this article. Based upon two qualitative comparative project analyses of a total of thirty-
eight identified cases of unforeseen events in two major Dutch PPP infrastructure project 
implementations, conclusions can be drawn. The first is that externally-oriented manage-
ment responses to social events result in satisfaction, and internally-oriented management 
responses to social events do not (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). The second, however, is that 
internally-oriented management responses can also result in satisfaction, but that this re-
quires a public partner to be involved so as to intermediate between the management and 
the environment. This insight emphasizes the importance of cooperative management in 
PPP implementation. A third conclusion is that managers often apply internally-oriented 
and autonomy-seeking responses to events.
By comparing the two projects, we found some intriguing explanations for these 
phenomena. First, the combination of local and national management cultures in the A2 
Maastricht project resulted in a unique externally-oriented and cooperative PPP approach, 
different from the normal way of working of Rijkswaterstaat. Such a combination was 
absent in the A15 project, where cooperation was restricted by the concessional DBFM 
contract. Consequently, cooperative action only happened reactively when tensions were 
already high (see also Verweij, 2015a), resulting in an implementation that is experienced 
as stressful.
A second explanation is time pressure. A characteristic of PPP implementation, i.e., 
the project construction and delivery, is the increasing time pressure. After contracting, 

131
Chapter 6  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
when the project “starts rolling” (Jones & Noble, 2008:109), time is experienced as more 
pressurized. This pressure is felt by managers, which explains their inclination towards 
internally-oriented and autonomy-seeking responses (cf. Gerrits, 2012).
Third, although excluding local stakeholders from the implementation scheme seems 
attractive in advance because it seems to simplify implementation, in practice, however, 
this may generate a project-inward orientation and (hence) unforeseen social events. 
Internalizing local stakeholders as partners in the partnership seems to pay off.
6.6.2.	 Discussion
The patterns and explanations for achieving satisfactory outcomes in PPP project 
implementation are based upon two case studies from the Netherlands. Although more 
comparative research is thus needed to corroborate the conclusions, our research points to 
several implications for PPP project implementation.
Because events mostly have social sources, and because they are best responded to with 
externally-oriented management responses and public-private cooperation, allocating suf-
ficient recourses (e.g., time, attention, money, personnel) to stakeholder management, and 
to managing the public-private partnership itself, is important (El-Gohary et al., 2006; 
Jones & Noble, 2008; Mistarihi et al., 2013) in avoiding bigger problems and greater costs 
later on. The importance of these aspects is easily overlooked or underestimated, because 
staying in control of planning and budget during PPP project implementation requires 
managers’ full attention. Keeping the project ‘under control’ is strived for through differ-
ent monitoring mechanisms deployed by public principals. Although these mechanisms 
are indisputably important – inter alia for safeguarding public values as quality, account-
ability, and transparency (Reynaers, 2014), and the prevention of ambiguous relationships 
between the partners – the danger in implementation is that monitoring becomes the sole 
focus. Consequently, stakeholders and their interests and influence on the project may be 
missed (Dimitriou et al., 2013). The clear division of tasks, risks, roles, and responsibilities 
is stressed but our study shows that investment in cooperation, and the closer involvement 
of local stakeholders (such as municipalities) in the partnership, so as to achieve mutual 
satisfactory results, is equally important.
It would also be worthwhile researching more flexible contract structures. It was in 
fact suggested in the interviews that the integrated area development approach of the A2 
Maastricht project generated fewer stress-sensitive incentives and allowed more flexibility, 
because the profits are in the development of real estate, and private contractor Avenue2 
was given some degree of flexibility in planning the exact construction of the real estate, 
i.e., to build real estate when there is a favorable market for it. Perhaps such characteristics 
can also be incorporated in concessional PPP models, thus creating more flexibility in 
project implementation.
Public agencies are increasingly looking to DBFM for the delivery of public works and 
services (e.g., Rijkswaterstaat, 2011). We understand the attractiveness of the concessional 
model. It promises the advantages of partnerships and simultaneously the separation of 

Part 3  |  Analyses of two large infrastructure project implementations
132
the public and private domains to prevent intransparency and corruption. We understand 
and support these values. At the same time, our research suggests, although this should be 
corroborated with further studies into DBFM projects, that there are other PPP models 
more prone to externally-oriented management and public-private cooperation, resulting 
in more satisfactory outcomes during implementation. The alliance model seems more 
flexible in the sense that it facilitates externally-oriented management and public-private 
cooperation. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the more contractual and non-
cooperative approach, that characterized the concessional model in project implementa-
tion, also explains poor project performance (in terms of, e.g., quality, cost overruns, and 
time delays) at the delivery of the total project. More research is needed for this. However, 
our broader message here is that policy-makers may do well tempering their enthusiasm 
for DBFM a bit and to take a critical attitude towards it (cf. Hodge & Greve, 2007), or at 
least to bear in mind that the concessional DBFM model is not the only way to advance 
in infrastructure project realization. Other PPP formats may have certain advantages over 
DBFM.

cross-Project Analysis of Multiple 
infrastructure Project implementations
Th e basic rationale of chapter 7 is to evaluate to what extent the management patterns and 
explanations, found in Part 3 of this thesis, are also found in a larger set of PPP infrastructure 
project implementations (i.e., the fourth and fi fth sub-questions). Th is shift from the studies 
of the two project implementations of the A2 Maastricht and the A15 Mava, via a comparison 
of them, to a comparison of the implementation of a medium number of projects, can be 
imagined as a t-structure: the ‘leg’ of the t represents the two studies and the ‘roof’ represents 
the comparison of multiple project implementations. Th is research strategy from in-depth to 
cross-case has been proposed as a meaningful way to study complexity (Buijs et al., 2009).
in addition to evaluating whether the management patterns found in Part 3 are reproduced 
in a medium-n of project implementations, chapter 7 is also an attempt to evaluate whether 
diff erent management patterns can be found in diff erent kinds of projects, in terms of contract, 
scope, and size. Th e chapter has been submitted to a journal.

Abstract
An understudied but important aspect of the successful completion of infrastructure 
projects is the extent to which they are satisfactorily implemented. This article, there-
fore, examines how satisfactory outcomes are produced in the implementation phase of 
infrastructure projects. To this purpose, twenty-seven Dutch road construction projects 
are systematically analyzed with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The 
results indicate that externally-oriented management and close public-private cooperation 
are positively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, in projects with a narrower scope, 
cooperation can also be more contractual and less close. This article concludes that public 
and private partners interactively working together, and a stakeholder-oriented project 
implementation approach, result in satisfactory outcomes. In less complex projects with 
narrower scopes, the partners may rely on less interactive forms of cooperation, more 
characterized by monitoring contract compliance.

Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
7.1.	
Introduction
Implementing infrastructure projects, such as highways, railways, tunnels, and bridges, 
is complex. Government policies require that projects are implemented in public-private 
partnerships (PPPs), using innovative contract types such as Design, Build, Finance, and 
Maintain (DBFM), with minimal impact on the environment (in terms of, e.g., noise 
nuisance and road availability) and maximum quality, and for as low as possible budgets. 
Rijkswaterstaat, the major public procurer of transportation infrastructure in the Nether-
lands, is a case in point (Rijkswaterstaat, 2014). It has a “the market unless” policy, wants 
to double its number of DBFM projects by 2020, aspires being a “public-oriented network 
manager” (Metze, 2010), and it wants to attain the same or higher levels of production 
(i.e., road construction and maintenance) with smaller budgets (Rijkswaterstaat, 2008, 
2011). The construction of projects is also complex in itself (Baccarini, 1996; Bertelsen, 
2003), involving many stakeholders with different and sometimes unforeseen changing 
interests, a multitude of regulatory frameworks and restrictions, and complex and some-
times unplanned physical and technical situations (De Bruijn & Leijten, 2008; Hertogh 
& Westerveld, 2010; Teisman, Westerveld et al., 2009; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). Hence, 
if not managed successfully, obtained or anticipated gains in the planning, procurement, 
and contracting of infrastructure projects might easily be lost in the implementation (i.e., 
construction and delivery). Implementation, however, is a relatively under-researched 
topic in the literature. Research on PPPs in construction focuses instead on planning and 
pre-contract issues (Jones & Noble, 2008; Weihe, 2008b), especially procurement, tender-
ing, risk allocation, and PPP finance (Ke et al., 2009; Kwak et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2010). 
Therefore, this article studies how infrastructure projects can be successfully implemented.
Building on PPP management literature (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Edelenbos & 
Teisman, 2008; Verweij, 2015a), the focus is on the management orientation and the 
public-private cooperation as explanatory conditions for successful implementation. 
Research, mostly case studies (e.g., Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015), has stressed 
the importance of externally-oriented management approaches, and close and informal 
public-private cooperation. However, infrastructure projects are no one size fits all; e.g., a 
DBFM contract may require different cooperation and management orientations than a 
Design and Construct (D&C) contract. This article, hence, investigates whether different 
kinds of infrastructure projects – in terms of contract type, project scope, and project 
size – may be (or need to be) managed differently to have a successful implementation 
process.
An important issue here is the measure of success. Concerns have been raised in the 
literature as to how success should be defined. It is increasingly argued that the complexity 
of infrastructure projects, involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, requires 
measures beyond the iron triangle’s cost, time, and quality (e.g., Atkinson, 1999; Dimitriou 
et al., 2013; Jeffares et al., 2013); the iron triangle does not capture well the complexity 
of what may constitute a successful project implementation. For instance, infrastructure 
projects may be completed within time and budget and according to specifications, but 

Part 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in multiple projects
140
public values such as transparency or accountability (e.g., Reynaers, 2014) may have been 
impaired, the public-private relationship may be strained, or external stakeholders’ inter-
ests may have been harmed by the project. To capture the heterogeneous and subjective 
nature of success in infrastructure project implementation, the concept of ‘satisfaction’ is 
deployed (cf. Kärnä et al., 2013; Lehtiranta et al., 2012; Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 
2015). The central research question of this article thus is: which combinations of manage-
ment and public-private cooperation, in different kinds of infrastructure projects, produce 
satisfactory outcomes in the implementation phase?
Another important issue is the research approach to this question. To understand how 
satisfactory outcomes in complex project implementation processes are actually produced, 
scholars have called for more contextualized, practice-oriented approaches to project man-
agement research (cf. Blomquist et al., 2010; Cicmil et al., 2006). Nevertheless, research 
on construction management still lacks a focus on project implementation in a contextual 
perspective (Hu, Chan, Le, & Jin, 2013). Case studies that are conducted can provide 
valuable in-depth insights into the complexity of infrastructure project implementation 
(cf. Blomquist et al., 2010). However, their findings are often difficult to generalize, exactly 
because the uniqueness and complexity of the infrastructure projects is emphasized in 
the case studies (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). What is hence needed is research that strikes 
a balance between highlighting the unique aspects of projects, and the commonalities 
between them. This article studies a medium-n of project implementations, allowing 
for limited generalization. It applies fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis or fsQCA 
(Ragin, 2008a), a methodological approach that was recently proposed for infrastructure 
project research (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013), that is well-suited for studying a medium-n of 
cases and limited generalization.
This article is further structured as follows. In Section 7.2, the background of the 
research is briefly presented, providing the framework for the analysis. Section 7.3 presents 
and explains the data and methods. The analysis and results are provided in Section 7.4. 
Section 7.5 comprises the discussion of the results, including some reflections on the study 
and the method. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7.6.

Managing infrastructure project 
implementation
In their study of eighteen large, complex infrastructure projects, Edelenbos and Klijn 
(2009) made a distinction between project management and process management (see also 
De Bruijn et al., 2010; Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008). Project management is character-
ized by a closed, internal project orientation. Indicators are that minimal information 
is provided to the stakeholder environment about the project’s progress, the emphasis 
is on making progress by speeding up processes, solutions for problems are sought in 
the project organization so as to promote the project interest, management persists on 
achieving pre-determined goals regardless of changing circumstances, and communication 

141
Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
to the stakeholder environment takes a DAD-strategy (decide, announce, and defend) 
(Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). This internally-oriented approach is often associated with 
traditional modes of management that emphasize the iron triangle measures of success 
(Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008). Implementing infrastructure projects, however, does not 
happen in isolation. They are implemented in a social context of external project stake-
holders. Because these stakeholders, such as municipalities or interest groups, can hamper 
or advance project implementation (Olander & Landin, 2005), for example by granting 
or not granting permits, this creates interdependencies between the internal and external 
project stakeholders. This idea is well-documented in network management theory (Kop-
penjan & Klijn, 2004) and stakeholder (management) theories (see Atkin & Skitmore, 
2008). The process management approach embodies the idea that stakeholder interests in 
project implementation should be prominently addressed because of the interdependen-
cies (De Bruijn et al., 2010; Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). It is characterized by an open, 
external project orientation. Indicators are (see Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009) that the project 
is accessible to interested parties, the emphasis is on creating or maintaining support for 
the project, solutions are sought together with external stakeholders if possible, manage-
ment is receptive and flexible to changing circumstances, and communication takes a 
DDD-strategy (dialogue, decide, and deliver). Edelenbos and Klijn (2009) and others 
(Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015) found that the externally-oriented management 
approach is associated with better outcomes, and others have claimed as well that address-
ing stakeholders is crucial for project success (e.g., El-Gohary et al., 2006).
In carrying out either the project or process management approach, the public princi-
pal and private contractor may operate in a less or more cooperative fashion. With regard 
to cooperation, building on the research of Edelenbos and Klijn (2009) and Edelenbos 
and Teisman (2008), a distinction can be made between a more cooperative and a more 
contractual approach. Indicators for the latter are a strong emphasis on the contract, lim-
ited interaction between the public and private partners, and on monitoring compliance 
with the contract. The more cooperative orientation puts less emphasis on the contract, 
‘working together’ does not stop once the contract is signed but continues in the imple-
mentation phase of the project, and it is characterized by more public-private interaction 
and mutual trust. Recent research (cf. Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015) shows that 
the cooperative orientation is associated with better outcomes in project implementation. 
Often, when contracts have been signed, the public-private relationship changes from one 
of collaborative plan development to one in which the contractor manages implementa-
tion. This, however, may leave potential resources untapped; public principals often have 
longer-standing relationships with local external project stakeholders than private contrac-
tors, and they may use these relationships to manage external stakeholder issues more ef-
fectively (Verweij, 2015a; cf. De Schepper, Dooms, & Haezendonck, 2014). Other studies 
also indicate the positive relationship between cooperation and outcomes in infrastructure 
projects (e.g., Chan, Chan, & Ho, 2003; Larson, 1997).
In assessing how infrastructure projects can be successfully implemented, it is un-
derstood that success in implementation can entail different things. Costs, time, and

quality matter, but other outcomes  –  e.g., a good public-private relationship, safety, 
political support, or external stakeholder satisfaction – also determine whether a project 
implementation is regarded as successful or not (cf. Jeffares et al., 2013). The concept of 
‘satisfaction’ captures this. It is a multi-dimensional, heterogeneous concept (Lehtiranta et 
al., 2012). The study of satisfaction in infrastructure projects receives growing attention in 
the literature, as it is increasingly recognized that satisfaction of project participants is an 
important indicator of project success (Kärnä et al., 2013; Leung, Ng, & Cheung, 2004). 
It is a ‘soft performance indicator’ that complements the traditional performance measures 
of time, cost, and quality (cf. Atkinson, 1999), and which is better able to address the 
holistic, heterogeneous, and subjective nature of success in implementing infrastructure 
projects (Kärnä et al., 2013; Lehtiranta et al., 2012).
7.2.1.	
Contract type, project scope, and project size
Two in-depth case studies into the management practices of transportation infrastructure 
projects found that a more externally-oriented management approach, and a more co-
operative management approach, produces satisfactory outcomes in the implementation 
phase – and the other approaches less so (Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). One 
project was characterized by more cooperation and an externally-oriented management 
approach, and mainly satisfactory outcomes were produced. In contrast, the other project 
was characterized more by a contractual relationship between the partners and an internal-
ly-oriented management approach; its implementation was unsatisfactory, characterized 
by cost overruns and strained relationships between the project partners and between the 
project and external stakeholders.
The successful project implementation concerned a project with a D&C contract. 
Assuming a broad definition of PPP, a D&C project is a partnership where, in contrast to 
typical public procurement, the contractor is also responsible for the design of the project 
(Yescombe, 2007; 2013). The second project has a DBFM contract (see, e.g., Yescombe, 
2007). In this type of PPP, the contractor also bears responsibility for financing and the 
maintenance (often for periods exceeding ten years) of the project. Especially characteristic 
for DBFM contracts is that they insert clear contractual divisions into the partnership (cf. 
Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008; Klijn & Teisman, 2005) – the philosophy of this contract 
type is that the market’s potential is maximally used when the government is minimally in-
volved in project implementation, only in terms of monitoring contract compliance. The 
success depends largely on achieving the predefined milestones (because these milestones 
are linked to periodic payments by the public principal and, therefore, to the financial 
constructions between the contractor and lenders). It was further suggested in the case 
study of this second project that the nature of the DBFM contract also strengthened the 
internal management orientation, as it was felt by project managers that engaging with 
stakeholders pressurized the achievement of the milestones.
The first project involved the reconstruction of a highway into a 2.3 km long tunnel, 
combined with inner-city urban development. It is an integral urban project wherein 

143
Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
different spatial functions were combined to achieve synergy. This wide scope meant that 
many different stakeholders were involved, with their interests embedded in the project 
scope. In fact, the project’s clientship was held by Rijkswaterstaat together with local and 
regional governments. For these local project stakeholders, communication and stake-
holder management were top priorities and principal and contractor cooperated closely 
herein. In contrast to the first project, the DBFM case involves one spatial function: the 
reconstruction of a 37 km long highway corridor. Rijkswaterstaat bears sole responsibility 
for the corridor and is the principal of the project. External stakeholders are not closely 
involved, and rather act to minimize the impact of the project on their interests. In the 
present article, by comparing multiple infrastructure project implementations, we will 
seek to find out whether projects with different contract types and project scopes, as was 
suggested in the case studies, are indeed managed differently, thus contributing to explain-
ing different project implementation successes.
In addition to contract type and project scope, project size is also suggested as a pos-
sible determinant for success in Dutch projects. Studies have suggested that infrastructure 
projects with smaller budgets tend to have larger average percentages of cost overrun 
(Verweij et al., 2015; Cantarelli, Van Wee et al., 2012; see also, e.g., Odeck, 2004), for 
instance because the larger projects are linked to the most capable managers (Verweij et 
al., 2015). On the other hand, larger projects, as evidenced by the two case studies, may 
attract more socio-political attention, are riskier, and are easier criticized, which are factors 
that may also constitute satisfaction. Including project size in the analysis may shed light 
on which is the case.
7.3.	
Methods and data
7.3.1.	
Data collection
Rijkswaterstaat is the executive agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the 
Environment. It is the major procurer of public transportation infrastructure, with an 
annual turnover of approximately € 5 billion (Rijkswaterstaat, 2014). Since 2011, Rijk-
swaterstaat integrated all its project data into a single database, from which the project 
implementation data were collected. A few projects had some missing data, for which 
MIRT Project Books (e.g., Ministry of I&M, 2013) and Rijkswaterstaat managers were 
consulted.52 The database contained 134 projects, twenty-seven of which had data about 
the implementation phase of the project that was detailed enough for analysis. Data col-
lection took place between November 2013 and June 2014 at the Rijkswaterstaat office 
in Utrecht (the Netherlands). The results of the analysis have been discussed with, and 
fed back to, Rijkswaterstaat managers. In this way, the present study intends to have 
contributed to reducing the gap between infrastructure project management research and 
practice (cf. Blomquist et al., 2010; Winter et al., 2006). Publishing about the data was

allowed, provided that the projects were anonymized. The project-identifiers used in the 
analysis (see the tables) correspond to the identifiers in the Rijkswaterstaat database.
7.3.2.	
Method: fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis
A methodological approach that is especially suitable for comparatively analyzing a 
medium-n of qualitative cases and limited generalization is fuzzy set qualitative com-
parative analysis (Ragin, 2000; 2008a). QCA is becoming increasingly popular (Rihoux et 
al., 2013). One important reason is that it strikes a balance between in-depth contextual 
case knowledge and case complexity on the one hand, and identifying commonalities 
between cases and pattern generalization on the other hand (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). It 
was recently introduced in the field of transportation infrastructure research (Jordan et al., 
2011; Verweij & Gerrits, 2013).
In QCA, cases are understood as combinations of conditions, i.e., configurations 
(Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). Each case – infrastructure project implementations in 
the current article – has membership between 0 and 1 in each condition and the outcome 
(Ragin, 2008a). The conditions are: management, cooperation, contract type, project 
scope, and project size. Each condition has cross-over points that separate qualitatively 
different cases from each other. In the QCA approach, it is assumed that configurations 
produce the outcome. In this article, the outcome is satisfaction. By systematically com-
paring configurations that agree on the outcome but differ in one of the conditions, more 
general patterns can be discovered, pointing to conditions (or configurations) that might 
be considered necessary or sufficient to produce the outcome. Basically, a condition is 
necessary when it has to be present for the outcome to occur, and it is sufficient if it can 
produce the outcome by itself (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). The analysis in this article 
adheres to the QCA standards of good practice as outlined by Schneider and Wagemann 
(2010; 2012). The comparative process of QCA entails a number of steps (see Verweij, 
2015a).
After the case data have been collected and coded, the first step in QCA is the con-
struction of the data matrix. This means that each case is scored on each of the conditions 
and the outcome. It involves calibration: the transformation of raw data into fuzzy scores 
between 0 and 1 (see Section 7.3.3) by clustering similar cases per condition. The calibration 
process and data matrix are important parts of QCA and have to be reported (Schneider 
& Wagemann, 2010). Each row in the data matrix represents a case as a configuration.
The second step is grouping cases together that exhibit the same configuration. This 
leads to the truth table (see Section 7.4). This table lists all the logically possible configura-
tions and shows which configurations are covered by which cases. With five conditions, 
the number of logically possible configurations is thirty-two (i.e., 2^5). Configurations 
that are empirically absent (i.e., ‘empty truth table rows’) are called logical remainders. 
These may be used later in the comparative process as counterfactuals, so as to arrive at 
more parsimonious patterns (Ragin & Sonnett, 2005).

145
Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
The third step is the truth table minimization (see Section 7.4). This involves compar-
ing truth table rows that agree on the outcome and differ in one of the conditions. It often 
occurs that a truth table row is covered by cases with opposite outcomes. Such logical 
contradictions are expressed with the consistency value (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). 
A consistency of 1.0 means that a configuration has no contradictions; lower values signal 
imperfect relationships between the configuration and the outcome. If the consistency of a 
truth table row is high enough (see Schneider & Wagemann, 2012), then it is assigned the 
outcome (i.e., 1); if not, it is assigned the absence of the outcome (i.e., 0). It is important 
to examine the cases that cover configurations before outcome scores are blindly assigned 
(see Section 7.4).
The final step is the interpretation and discussion of the results – also called solutions 
in QCA – of the truth table minimization (see Section 7.5.1), in terms of the cases that 
are covered by the patterns and in terms of theoretical expectations. The QCA process 
that is very briefly summarized here is iterative (Rihoux, 2013; Rihoux & Lobe, 2009); for 
instance, contradictions may signal the researcher to return to the qualitative case data, 
which may lead to recalibration.
7.3.3.	
Data and calibration
For each project, the level of completeness was calculated to ensure comparability of the 
projects. The completeness level is defined as the number of days between the start of the 
implementation phase (i.e., project realization) and the date at which the project data 
were measured, divided by the number of days between the start of the implementation 
and the (planned) project delivery date. Depending on the completeness level, the project 
data were measured at January 1st 2012 (i.e., data about 2011), 2013 (i.e., data about 2012), 
or 2014 (i.e., data about 2013). For instance, the D&C project discussed above started 
construction on 14-2-2011, has a planned delivery date of 16-12-2016 (see Projectbureau 
A2 Maastricht, 2014), and the data were measured at January 1st 2014. This resulted in a 
level of completeness of 49%. The average completeness level was 73%, with a median of 
74%, and a standard deviation of 17%. The projects are thus fairly similar with regard to 
their completeness.
7.3.3.1.	Satisfaction
Three times a year, the project managers qualitatively assess their project on multiple 
indicators: budget of the project, cash prognosis, achievement of milestones, risk manage-
ment, administrative-political issues, public-orientedness, cooperation with the market, 
and safety in the project.53 Based on their qualitative assessments, the managers score 
53	
Three indicators were not used (i.e., signing of scope documents, capacity of the principal’s project team, 
and evaluation of project quality). They could not be related, based on the qualitative empirical data, to 
management or public-​private cooperation in the project. They concerned Rijkswaterstaat-​internal issues 
rather than project-​related issues.

Part 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in multiple projects
146
their project on each indicator with either code red (low satisfaction, 0 points), code 
orange (medium satisfaction, 1 point), or code green (satisfaction, 2 points). Satisfaction 
is measured by aggregating the scores for the eight indicators and then averaging the year’s 
three measurements.
Using the QCA Tosmana software (Cronqvist, 2011), which performs a cluster analysis 
to group similar projects, and separate different ones, three cross-over points were identi-
fied: 10.17, 12.34, and 13.50. This means that the twenty-seven projects are divided into 
four groups. Using the QCA package in R (Duşa & Thiem, 2014; Thiem & Duşa, 2013b), 
this resulted in the following fuzzy four-value (see Ragin, 2008a) calibration: 0.00 (8.67-
10.17), 0.33 (10.18-12.34), 0.67 (12.35-13.50), and 1.00 (13.51-16.00).54
7.3.3.2.	Management and cooperation
For the management and cooperation orientations in the projects, only qualitative data 
were available. Three types of management reports from the database were used: general 
management summaries (one report per year), stakeholder environment reports (three 
reports per year), and market cooperation reports (three reports per year). The seven 
reports per project, 202 pages in total for all projects, were coded with qualitative data-
analysis software (Provalis Research, 2013). For instance, if a text fragment fitted with 
indicators for externally-oriented management (see Section 7.2), then it was coded as 
such. Based on the coded data, qualitative project descriptions were constructed and these 
were cross-compared (Ragin, 1992). This process consisted of two iterations – a few small 
contradictions led to reexamination of some project data, resulting in additional insights, 
recoding, and a recalibration – as is common in QCA, and resulted in four clusters of 
projects, with scores of 0.00, 0.33, 0.67, or 1.00. Low scores indicate a more internal 
management orientation and a contractual orientation, and higher scores indicate more 
external management and cooperative orientations.
7.3.3.3.	Contract type, project scope, and project size
The contract type has two possible values: D&C and DBFM. The D&C projects were 
assigned a score of 1.00 and the DBFM projects were assigned a score of 0.00.
Four clusters of projects were identified with regard to the project scope. Standard 
road construction projects were assigned a score of 0.00, road projects that also included 
the construction of several new (i.e., not just the renovation of existing ones) tunnels or 
bridges were assigned as score of 0.33, more complex road projects with large new tunnels 
or bridges (e.g., the DBFM project mentioned in Section 7.2.1 that includes a new double 
vertical lift bridge of nearly 180 meters) received a score of 0.67, and integral projects that 
combine several spatial functions (e.g., the D&C project from Section 7.2.1) were scored 
1.00.
54	
A finer-​grained scale was not used because the managers’ qualitative assessments did not allow the interpre-
tation of small differences in project satisfaction scores.

147
Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
The project size was measured by taking the projected final expenditures of the 
projects. The largest project has a size of € 2,269 million (i.e., over € 2.2 billion). The 
smallest project is just under € 9.5 million. The average project size is € 386 million, with a 
median of € 211 million and standard deviation of € 556 million. Using the QCA Tosmana 
software, three cross-over points were identified: € 76.566 million, € 242.894 million, and 
€ 584.061 million. This resulted in the following calibration: 0.00 (€ 9.488 to € 76.566 
million), 0.33 (€ 76.567 to € 242.894 million), 0.67 (€ 242.895 to € 584.061 million), and 
1.00 (€ 584.062 to € 2.268.904 million).
7.3.3.4.	Data matrix
The calibration leads to the data matrix provided as Table 7.1. For the conditions project 
size (SIZE) and contract type (CONT), and for the outcome satisfaction (SATIS), the 
raw data are also provided. Due to space restrictions, for the other conditions – manage-
ment (MAN), cooperation (COOP), and scope (SCOPE) – only the calibrated data are 
provided. Finally, the completeness levels of the projects and the used data (i.e., 2011, 2012, 
or 2013) are provided.
7.4.	
Analysis and results 55
Using the QCA package in R, the truth table is constructed (see Table 7.2). The table 
shows that eleven logically possible configurations are empirically present. This means 
that there are twenty-one logical remainders. The frequency cutoff (see the “n” column) is 
set at 1: configurations that are covered by at least one project are included in the further 
analysis. The consistency cutoff point is set 0.875 (see the “incl.” column). Four arguments 
substantiate this choice (see Ragin, 2009; Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). First, it is well 
above the lowest ‘permitted’ value of 0.75. Second, a clear gap in consistency values can be 
recognized at 0.875. Third, the high PRI (i.e., Proportional Reduction in Inconsistency) 
scores (see Schneider & Wagemann, 2012) indicate that there is a big difference between 
the configurations’ consistency scores for high satisfaction and low satisfaction. Fourth 
and most importantly, the cutoff point is substantiated by examining the cases covered by 
the configurations.
Configurations 8, 21, 23, 24, and 28 are covered by project implementation cases that 
all have high satisfaction. The configurations with consistency scores below the 0.875 
55	
This section focuses on the truth table analysis, which is the analysis of sufficiency. An examination of 
the XY-​plots, and the test for necessity, revealed that there are no conditions or configurations that can 
be considered necessary according to the commonly accepted consistency threshold of 0.9 (Ragin, 2009). 
Only three conditions had consistency values above a 0.8 threshold: scope (con. 0.818, cov. 0.775), CONT 
(con. 0.873, cov. 0.695), and SIZE+coop (con. 0.873, cov. 0.685). All the analytical steps in this section 
have also been performed with the fs/​QCA software (Ragin & Davey, 2014), which produced the exact 
same results as the QCA package in R.

cutoff point are all covered by (a clear majority of) cases with low satisfaction. Two of the 
configurations above the cutoff point, however, can be considered contradictions.
Configuration 32, which is covered by cases P.0034 and P.0094, is a contradiction 
because P.0094 has a satisfaction score of 0.33 (see Table 7.1). However, the raw satisfaction 
score for P.0094 is closer to a fuzzy value of 0.67 (i.e., 12.34-11.67=0.67) than to a value of 
0.00 (i.e., 11.67-10.18=1.49). Moreover, the qualitative raw data for this case (i.e., the man-
agers’ qualitative assessments) made clear that the project implementation had multiple 
orange codes not so much because managers were dissatisfied with the implementation, 
but rather to signal to the Rijkswaterstaat hierarchy that the project had a “high risk

profile” and thus required unabated management attention. Given these considerations, 
the truth table row was still assigned the outcome (i.e., 1).
The second contradiction concerns case P.0179 in configuration 19. The qualitative raw 
data showed that this case is a clear low-performer. Rijkswaterstaat managers identified 
that the contractor’s “knowledge and information systems” were not trustworthy. Because 
Rijkswaterstaat monitors contract compliance via system-based contract management, its 
managers could not, as a consequence, assess whether the quality of the construction works 
was according to contract specifications. In other words, the public values of transparency 
and quality (see, e.g., Reynaers, 2014) were at stake, preventing Rijkswaterstaat from mak-
ing legitimate payments to the contractor. This situation deteriorated the public-private 
relationship. It also, as a consequence, increased the risks in the project and compromised 
the achievement of implementation milestones. Despite this case, the configuration is still 
assigned the outcome, because the other six cases all have satisfaction scores of 1.00. The 
contradiction is reflected in the less-than-perfect consistency score.
The next step is the truth table minimization, which was conducted with the eqmcc() 
function in the QCA package in R. The results are presented in Tables 7.3 and 7.4. The 
conservative truth table solution, shown in Table 7.3, is produced by not including logical 
remainders in the minimization (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). Uppercase letters in 
the table indicate a 0.67-1.00 condition score (e.g., SCOPE means a wide scope), and 
lowercase letters indicate a 0.00-0.33 condition score (e.g., scope means a narrow scope).

The intermediate solution, provided in Table 7.4,56 is produced by including logical 
remainders in the truth table minimization (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). It involves 
the formulation of directional expectations as to how conditions might contribute to 
producing satisfactory outcomes in project implementation. Based on the framework 
presented in Section 7.2, two expectations are formulated: (1) a cooperative orientation 
(COOP) contributes to producing satisfaction and (2) externally-oriented management 
(MAN) contributes to producing satisfaction. For the other three conditions (i.e., contract 
type, project scope, and project size) no directional expectations are formulated because 
the evidence base is considered not strong enough to support this. Indeed, the aim is 
to explore whether different kinds of infrastructure projects may be managed differently 
to have a successful implementation process. Comparing the intermediate solution with 
56	
The row dominance (row.dom) argument was applied. Two intermediate solutions were produced. The 
intermediate solution not shown in Table 7.4 was the same as the conservative solution in Table 7.3, with 
the only difference that the minimized configuration CONT*scope*SIZE*coop (with incl. 0.883, cov.r 
0.272) became a bit more parsimonious: CONT*scope*SIZE (with incl. 0.895, cov.r 0.308). The fs/​QCA 
software (Ragin & Davey, 2014) only provided the intermediate solution in Table 7.4 by default (see Thiem 
& Duşa, 2013a), but the QCA package in R provided two dominant prime implicants. A prime implicant 
is a minimized configuration, that ‘implies’ a certain set of configurations from the truth table, which 
cannot be minimized any further. Sometimes there are multiple minimization outcomes for the truth 
table, defined by which implicant is chosen. Finally, it must be mentioned for good order (Schneider & 
Wagemann, 2010) that the parsimonious solution for Table 7.4 was COOP + scope*SIZE + scope*MAN 
(incl. 0.865, cov.r 0.818).

the conservative solution, in effect, case P.0272 now covers all minimized configurations, 
resulting is somewhat less complex patterns.
To complete the analysis, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was also per-
formed for low satisfaction, for which a separate truth table was constructed (not reported 
in the present article). Given the consistency scores in that truth table, only the two 
configurations covered by cases P.0190 and P.0218 (see Table 7.2) could be included in 
the truth table minimization. Both cases have low satisfaction (see Table 7.1). Combining 
these two configurations yielded cont*SCOPE*SIZE*coop as being associated with low 
satisfaction (with incl. 1.000, cov. 0.154).

Discussion
7.5.1.	
Interpretation and discussion of the results
First of all, the results show that there are no necessary or sufficient conditions for produc-
ing satisfactory outcomes in the implementation phase of infrastructure projects: none of 
the five conditions appears in each minimized configuration (necessity), and no condition 
appears independently of other conditions (sufficiency). Instead, the results indicate that 
conditions combine in configurations, and that there are four configurations that are 
sufficient for producing satisfactory outcomes. This highlights the configurational and 
equifinal nature of transportation infrastructure development (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). 
For the interpretation of the results, we will focus on the conservative solution (i.e., Table 
7.3) because the substantial simplification that is accomplished in the intermediate solu-
tion (i.e., Table 7.4) is caused by only one case (i.e., P.0272), which seems a rather meager 
basis for drawing much more parsimonious conclusions.
The first pattern of the conservative solution states that externally-oriented management 
combined with a cooperative public-private approach, in projects with a wide scope and a 
D&C contract, produces satisfactory outcomes. This pattern underscores the importance 
of externally-oriented management and a cooperative relationship. This result substantiates 
previous research into the management of PPP projects (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). In fact, 
one of the three cases covered by this pattern is the D&C infrastructure project discussed 
in Section 7.2.1 (Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). In each of the three projects, technically and 
socio-politically complex and innovative project scopes  –  in two cases inner-city urban 
development (P.0034 and P.0094) – were implemented in close cooperation with external 
project stakeholders and between the public and private partners (see also Lenferink, 2014). 
Stakeholders are co-principals in the project (P.0034), or they are proactively involved by the 
project in the implementation (P.0094) to tackle problems upfront. In the projects, there 
was intensive communication towards citizens via, e.g., Facebook, newsletters, information-
meetings, emails, and construction site visits. The communication monitors deployed by 
the projects found that this was appreciated by citizens, who showed understanding for the 
nuisances caused by the projects (cf. Hamersma, Tillema, Sussman, & Arts, 2014). Of course, 

Part 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in multiple projects
152
the partners in the projects had contracts that clearly defined roles and responsibilities. How-
ever, the sharing of knowledge for effective joint communication about the project (P.0034), 
the joint preparation of contract changes before they are formally submitted (P.0094), or the 
joint formulation of project goals and “celebration of small successes” (P.0196) proved effec-
tive and resulted in satisfaction. All projects had green codes for the indicator ‘cooperation 
with the market’, an important aspect of successfully implementing infrastructure projects 
(Chan et al., 2003; Larson, 1997).
The second configuration states that externally-oriented management combined with 
a contractual public-private approach, in projects with a narrower scope and with D&C 
contracts, also produces satisfaction. Compared to the previous one, this configuration 
shows that externally-oriented management remains important for achieving satisfaction 
(Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; El-Gohary et al., 2006), but that D&C projects with a narrower 
scope can also do without intensive public-private cooperation. The nine cases covered by 
this pattern are all more or less ‘straightforward projects’, such as the construction of new 
roads and additional traffic lanes. It seems that more traditional line-oriented road projects 
can be implemented more at arm’s length from public principals; the more multifaceted, 
socio-politically complex, area-oriented projects involving multiple stakeholders (i.e., the 
previous configuration) require closer public-private cooperation (cf. Geraldi, Maylor, & 
Williams, 2011; Heeres et al., 2012; Lenferink, 2014).
In fact, the solution that is associated with low satisfaction (i.e., cont*SCOPE*SIZE*coop), 
which represents the DBFM infrastructure project discussed in Section 7.2.1 (Verweij, 
2015a), seems to further substantiate this finding. It states that in large and multifaceted 
DBFM projects, a contractually-oriented cooperation is associated with low satisfaction. In 
the case of P.0190, the 37 km long highway corridor cut through many jurisdictional areas, 
affecting many local public stakeholders. As a governmental organization, Rijkswaterstaat 
was well-connected in this institutional landscape of public actors (e.g., municipalities and 
port authorities), but the private construction consortium not so much. Driven by the 
idea that the market was to be left responsible for managing the stakeholder relationships 
(Rijkswaterstaat’s “the market unless” policy), Rijkswaterstaat took a background position 
in the project’s implementation phase. When external stakeholders were dissatisfied with 
the project, however, they turned to Rijkswaterstaat to seek redress. When Rijkswaterstaat 
decided to become more active in the stakeholder management, stakeholder’s concerns 
were somewhat relieved. In hindsight, it thus seemed to have been a better strategy if the 
project had continued to make active use in the implementation phase of the stakeholder 
relationships that were built by Rijkswaterstaat in the planning phase (cf. Lenferink, 2014; 
Verweij, 2015a), instead of halting the public-private cooperation in stakeholder manage-
ment when the project entered the implementation phase.
The third configuration of the conservative solution offers an important nuance to the 
identified importance of the externally-oriented and cooperative management approaches 
for producing satisfactory outcomes (cf. Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009). As can be seen from 
Table 7.3, the pattern is covered by three cases. It indicates that in large projects with a 
D&C contract and a narrow scope, cooperation can be contractual, but also management 

153
Chapter 7  |  Comparing the A2 and A15 projects
need not to be externally-oriented to achieve satisfaction in implementation. Case P.0029, 
for instance, was a rather straightforward road construction project that received little 
media attention, upon which it was decided to only use basic press notifications to inform 
external stakeholders about road closures for construction. It suggests that less complex 
projects may need less far-reaching stakeholder management measures, and that more 
traditional modes of management and project organization can be relied upon in such 
cases (cf. Geraldi et al., 2011; Whitty & Maylor, 2009).
The fourth pattern states that the combination of externally-oriented management 
and a cooperative public-private orientation, in large projects with a narrow scope, 
still produces satisfactory outcomes in infrastructure project implementation. In other 
words, although the third configuration indicates that it is not necessary in large projects 
with narrow scopes, externally-oriented management and a cooperative orientation still 
produce satisfactory outcomes. This further underpins the positive relationship between 
externally-oriented management and public-private cooperation for achieving satisfaction 
(Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015). Interestingly, two of the projects cov-
ered by the fourth configuration have DBFM contracts (i.e., P.0247 and P.0351). Whereas 
previous PPP studies suggested that DBFM contracts might amplify project-inward and 
contract-focused orientations (Edelenbos & Klijn, 2009; Edelenbos & Teisman, 2008; 
Verweij, 2015a), the two cases P.0247 and P.0351 in the present study show that this is not 
necessarily true. Therefore, further research is required into the relationship between the 
nature of DBFM and the achievement of satisfactory outcomes in the implementation of 
transportation infrastructure projects.
7.5.2.	
Some reflections
The Rijkswaterstaat database provided valuable information about the reality of infra-
structure project implementation (cf. Cicmil et al., 2006). Comparatively analyzing 
twenty-seven projects, however, restricts the extent to which implementation practices can 
be known in-depth. Whereas in-depth case studies can provide more accurate descriptions 
of the management and cooperation practices in projects, this is difficult when comparing 
a medium number of projects. The upside is, though, that it allowed pattern generaliza-
tion. This is the classical trade-off between in-depth knowledge and the reconstruction 
of cross-case patterns. Both are important in studying the management of infrastructure 
projects (Buijs et al., 2009; Verweij & Gerrits, 2013).
As can be seen from the data matrix, there is little variation between the projects with 
regard to contract type. The reason is, simply, that few DBFM projects have been or are 
implemented in the Netherlands. Contract type was still included as a condition in the 
analysis so as to test the conjecture that the DBFM model might amplify project-inward 
and contract-focused orientations. The implication here is that no bold conclusions 
should be drawn with regard to the performance or success of DBFM in the Netherlands. 
At most, the results from the present analysis with regard to DBFM are provisional; once 

Part 4  |  Management and public-private cooperation in multiple projects
154
more DBFM projects are implemented in the Netherlands, future studies may generate 
more conclusive results.
Notwithstanding the limitations of fsQCA, it is a useful method for infrastructure 
research (Jordan et al., 2011; Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). Among its advantages are the abili-
ties to deal with a medium-n of projects, to combine qualitative and quantitative data and 
methods in a single analysis (Rihoux & Lobe, 2009), to provide a system of procedures 
that lead to a systematic comparison, and to strike a balance between in-depth knowledge 
and cross-case patterns (Verweij & Gerrits, 2013). The new QCA package in R proved a 
workable and trustworthy complement to the existing range of QCA software. Applica-
tions of QCA in this field are yet scarce (exceptions are, e.g., Delhi et al., 2012; Gross 
& Garvin, 2011; Verweij, 2015a; Verweij & Gerrits, 2015) but, as the method is gaining 
a strong foothold in the social sciences (Rihoux et al., 2013), more applications can be 
expected to follow.
7.6.	
Conclusion
Many studies in the field of infrastructure projects have focused on explaining the 
failure of projects (e.g., Flyvbjerg et al., 2003). This article took a different approach. 
Comparatively analyzing twenty-seven infrastructure road constructions, patterns were 
identified and discussed that are associated with satisfactory outcomes in transportation 
infrastructure development. Satisfaction is an important prerequisite for project success; 
dissatisfaction of project members and stakeholders hampers smooth project implementa-
tion and can contribute to project failure (Kärnä et al., 2013; Lehtiranta et al., 2012). 
This study confirmed findings from previous research, showing that public and private 
partners interactively working together, and a stakeholder-oriented project approach, are 
important contributors to satisfaction. In addition, in projects with a narrower scope, 
cooperation can also be more contractual and less close; in less complex projects, the 
partners may rely on less interactive forms of cooperation, more characterized by monitor-
ing contract compliance, thereby saving costs for the project (cf. De Schepper et al., 2014). 
These findings can provide practitioners and policy-makers in the field of transportation 
infrastructure projects with reference points as to how projects might be planned prior to 
implementation.

Th e fi fth and fi nal part of this thesis consists of one chapter. chapter 8 provides a brief re-
capitulation of the study, it formulates the conclusions by answering the research questions, 
and it provides a discussion by revisiting the practical and scientifi c relevance articulated in 
the introductory chapter. it discusses how learning processes within project implementations, 
across project implementations, and between people in implementation processes, can be 
facilitated. it also discusses how PPP implementations can be improved by reconsidering the 
drawn boundaries between the public and private partners, and between the project and the 
stakeholder enironment.

Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
8.1.	
The wickedness of project implementation and 
evaluation
In 2014, the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad published an article with the head-
line “Contractors struggle with A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein” (Editors, 2014). The article 
reported:57
“In total, the cost overrun amounts to € 217 million according to the latest project 
report from A-Lanes A15 (…). One of the major problems is the fact that Rijkswa-
terstaat as principal has changed its design several times. Additionally, there are a 
thousand permits involved in the project, where different stakeholders have different 
interests, with delays as a result. Also, the consortium faces the very complicated 
issue of needs and demands of various stakeholders – which are no contractual parties 
(…).”
Later, the same newspaper reported that this estimated cost overrun had increased to € 253 
million and that this number was going to increase more (Verbraeken & Weissink, 2014). 
It further stated:58
“According to Ballast Nedam [one of the participants in consortium A-Lanes A15, 
author], the cost overruns should be borne by the principal, Rijkswaterstaat. (…). It 
appears that Rijkswaterstaat does not have its act together in this project. An active 
role of Rijkswaterstaat is expected in the obtaining of timely and consistent coopera-
tion of the relevant public stakeholders in the provision of permits, says Ballast.”59
The articles recapitulate the motivation for this study (Section 1.2), and they show that the 
observations of the Scientific Council for Government Policy (WRR, 1994a) two decades 
ago, and of the Temporary Committee on Infrastructure Projects (TCI, 2004b) and the 
Committee Acceleration Decision-Making on Infrastructure Projects (Advisory Commit-
tee VBI, 2008) one decade ago, bear relevance still. Implementation processes, i.e., project 
construction and delivery, of public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects are 
persistently complex endeavors and this can be subjacent to poor performance (inter alia, 
budget overruns). In other words, project implementation is ‘wicked’: difficult to improve 
on (as indicated by an abundance of empirical research)60 because of its inherent complex 
systemic nature (Rittel & Webber, 1973). One manifestation thereof is the occurrence of 
unforeseen events.

Part 5  |  Conclusions and discussion 
162
This wickedness signals that the management of the implementation process is all the 
more important, so as to actually achieve the results anticipated in the planning – i.e., 
legal planning, procurement, and contracting – of the PPP infrastructure projects (Chap-
ter 1). Indeed, if not managed properly, obtained or anticipated gains in the planning of 
infrastructure projects might be lost in the implementation phase. Pressman and Wil-
davsky ([1973]1984) already pointed this out several decades ago, but the management of 
implementation is still an understudied topic in PPP infrastructure research (see Chapter 
1). Moreover, if we want to improve other (future) development processes of infrastructure 
projects, we need to learn from other (past) experiences with managing project implemen-
tation. This requires evaluation (Sanderson, 2002; Van der Meer & Edelenbos, 2006). As 
Pressman and Wildavsky expressed it: “learning is the key to both implementation and 
evaluation. We evaluate to learn, and we learn to implement” ([1973]1984:xviii).
However, implementation and evaluation are often separated (Pressman & Wildavsky, 
[1973]1984). There is an implementation-evaluation gap. That is, the inherent systemic 
complexity of the implementation processes – which means that the causes of, and solutions 
for, outcomes in/of projects cannot be predicted and identified unambiguously (Rittel & 
Webber, 1973) – is often not recognized or admitted in evaluations (Chapters 1, 2, and 3). 
The ambiguity is even more evident in PPP projects, where managers and organizations 
with fundamentally different perspectives, interests, goals, and practices (Jacobs, 1992) are 
involved. The gap between implementation and evaluation hampers learning (Pressman 
& Wildavsky, [1973]1984). That is: evaluations that fail to take into account the systemic 
complexity of implementation are based on unrealistic assumptions, and this makes them 
ineffective for learning from past experiences because they do not tell us what works when 
in which contexts and why (Chapter 3). In the case of infrastructure project development 
specifically: the failure to recognize or admit the systemic complexity of implementation 
sometimes, as a consequence, means that evaluations are used for reasons of accountability 
and blaming culprits instead of for learning (Lehtonen, 2014; Chapter 1). Learning from 
evaluation thus requires that the evaluation methodology and application do justice to the 
systemic complexity of the evaluand (Chapters 1 and 3). Connecting the implementation 
and evaluation of infrastructure projects is the challenge faced in this thesis.
In this doctoral study, implementation and evaluation are brought together for learn-
ing. This was done by establishing qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) as a complex-
ity-informed evaluation approach, and applying it to the study of the management of 
implementation processes of Dutch PPP transportation infrastructure projects. Combin-
ing literatures from the scientific fields of complexity, evaluation, project management, 
and public-private partnerships (see Section 1.5), the following question was researched: 
how can the implementation and management of PPP infrastructure projects be understood 
and evaluated from a complexity perspective using QCA, what management responses in project 
implementation yield (un)satisfactory outcomes, and how can this be explained?
Chapters 2 and 3 in Part 2 of the thesis focused on the first part of the research question. 
They lay the ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of this thesis. 
It was first argued that reality in general, and implementation processes of infrastructure 

163
Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
projects in particular, are complex. Second, it was explained what methodological require-
ments this complexity imposes on the evaluation of infrastructure projects. Third, it was 
assessed to what extent, and concluded that, QCA is able to meet these requisites.
In Chapters 4 to 7 in Parts 3 and 4 we put the money where the mouth was, applying 
QCA as a complexity-informed evaluation approach to the study of project implementa-
tions. The chapters mainly focused on the second part of the research question. Their 
basic logic followed a T-structure as proposed by Buijs, Eshuis, and Byrne (2009) in their 
discussion of approaches to researching complexity in public management. The ‘leg’ of 
the T is comprised of analyses of the A2 Maastricht (Chapter 4) and the A15 Maasvlakte-
Vaanplein (MaVa) (Chapter 5) projects, followed by a comparison of the two (Chapter 6). 
The ‘roof’ of the T is Chapter 7, where a larger number of projects (i.e., twenty-seven) are 
cross-compared so as to assess the generalizability of the two project studies.
In this final chapter, the research question is answered by drawing on the articles (i.e., 
chapters) that constitute this thesis (see Table 1.1) and the thesis’ lessons are enumerated. 
In Section 8.2, it is explained what the building blocks are of the complexity of project 
implementation (i.e., the first sub-question). In Section 8.3, the empirical findings of 
the research are presented, indicating how implementation processes are managed, and 
what management responses yield (un)satisfactory outcomes, and why (i.e., the fourth 
and fifth sub-questions). Section 8.4 presents the methodological findings of this study, 
explaining what the requirements are for evaluating complex infrastructure projects, and 
how QCA meets these requirements (i.e., the second and third sub-questions). Section 
8.5 comprises the discussion. Based on the research, an agenda for learning in project 
implementation processes is proposed, focusing on QCA as an approach for learning in 
and across implementation processes of public-private partnership projects (Section 8.5.1), 
and on the management lessons for future project implementations (Section 8.5.2). Final 
remarks are placed in Section 8.6.
8.2.	
The four building blocks of the systemic 
complexity of project implementation
If we want to learn how other (future) implementation processes of PPP infrastructure 
projects can be improved, we need, first, to understand the complexity of implementa-
tion processes. This complexity refers not just to the fact that implementation processes 
are very difficult. Complexity is a property of reality. The world of implementation is 
not a closed system controlled by a single project organization or manager. Rather, it is 
composed of open systems that are nested and interrelated. This implies that reality is non-
decomposable, contingent, non-compressible, and time-asymmetric (see Chapter 2). This 
view on reality has consequences for understanding the implementation and management 
of projects (see mainly Chapter 3, but also the first parts of Chapters 4 to 6).
Non-decomposability means that the implementation of a PPP infrastructure project 
cannot be understood by only studying the individual parts of a project, and then putting

the studied parts together. The implementation and its outcomes emerge from interactions 
between parts. These parts are both internal in (i.e., within the project’s organization) and 
external to (i.e., in the socio-physical environment or context) the project. In terms of 
internal parts, inter alia, public and private organizations are bound by a construction 
contract, and based on this contract they interact in various formal and informal ways 
to construct and deliver the project. In terms of external parts, when a project is being 
implemented, this means that the project interacts with an existing socio-physical system. 
This socio-physical system can be understood as a ‘syntax’ or specific mix of physical and 
social elements. For example, the system consists of roads, tunnels, bridges, rivers, dikes, 
and residential areas with dwellings, which are distributed in a certain way, and public 
organizations (e.g., municipalities, provinces, and waterboards) bear responsibilities for 
these physical elements which are also used by citizens and businesses. When the project 
interacts with this system, the system reacts. That is, social and physical events occur. 
These events are managed by public and private managers for the purpose of the project’s 
construction and delivery. From this myriad of dynamic interactions within the project 
and between the project and the context, the infrastructure project and its outcomes 
emerge. The whole outcome can be less or more than the assessments of individual internal 
or external parts indicate. For instance, public and private partners can be satisfied with a 
particular PPP contract, but in implementation unforeseen social events from the project’s 
context may impact the functioning of the contract, making it a less effective model for 
achieving intended outcomes (see also Section 8.5.2).
The non-decomposable nature of projects is crucial for understanding and evaluat-
ing projects. Simplistic evaluation methods that look at the effect of singular variables 
on outcomes do not create a realistic understanding of implementation processes, thus 
sustaining the implementation-evaluation gap. This makes them ineffective for learning.
Second, contingent reality implies that, because projects interact with socio-physical 
environments (i.e., contexts), and because environments differ between projects, the 
implementations of projects and project outcomes are unique for a specific environment. 
That assumption helps to understand why certain management strategies that result in 
satisfactory outcomes in one project may not generate satisfaction in another project. 
This thesis emphasizes the explanatory value of the context for project implementation 
and the unique properties of contexts (e.g., specific physical elements, spatial functions, 
or stakeholders). Because this context is systemic – i.e., because it consists of interact-
ing systems – it has similarities with other contexts (e.g., certain laws and regulations 
enforced by public actors apply nationwide). This means that socio-physical systems that 
are interacted with have similarities and peculiarities. Similarities can be managed with 
known strategies; peculiarities, however, will have to be managed adaptively. Together, this 
will and must result in unique and balanced implementation management strategies for 
projects. Contingency further means that explanations for projects, and outcomes in/of 
projects, are time-sensitive: an explanation for outcomes in a project at tn may not apply to 
outcomes at tn+1. It signals that the causal relationships between the interacting parts of the 
implementation with the partly-unique, partly-similar contexts, are inherently emerging 

165
Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
and can only be known for a specific time and place. The contingent understanding of 
reality boils down to the notion that explanations for project implementation processes 
and outcomes are case-specific, but that patterns may be explored and recognized across 
cases.
Contingency means that project implementations have to be understood and evalu-
ated in-context. Evaluation methods that ‘control for context’, or aim to establish univer-
sal laws, do not create a realistic understanding of implementation, which makes them 
ineffective for learning.
Reality is essentially non-compressible: implementation processes and outcomes result 
from the interacting systems in systems in systems. People cannot perceive and understand 
the full complexity of their reality; there are limits to humans’ cognitive capacities and 
the future still has to unfold itself. It simply cannot be understood a priori. This first 
means that public and private implementation managers draw boundaries, i.e., that their 
perceptions of their project, desired outcomes, and explanations of how these outcomes 
have to be achieved, are inevitably compressions – reductions and simplifications – of 
reality. Public and private managers have different backgrounds, tasks, roles, responsibili-
ties, etcetera: they are nested in, and interact with, a specific subsystem (and a specific 
experience – path-dependency). Based thereon, they draw specific boundaries. They have 
a specific understanding of their project, and based on their simplifications of their project 
reality they act. They don’t have another choice. The managers’ actions are grounded in 
their perceptions, understanding only a part of the relevant project reality.
Evaluations of implementation processes of infrastructure projects are also simplifica-
tions. The differences of managers, and the unfolding future and changing implementa-
tion context, mean that an effective management approach can easily become ineffective. 
Simplistic evaluation methods ignore this, creating an unrealistic understanding of 
implementation, which makes them inadequate for learning.
Time-asymmetry means that the trajectory of an infrastructure project is unidirectional 
or irreversible. Causality is emergent.61 This means that, although the outcomes in/of 
implementation may appear to be the result of a logical sequence of events in hindsight, 
this sequence of events is not there at the start of implementation. The sequence unfolds 
in the future. If time would be reversible, causality in social reality would be linear, and a 
particular sequence of events that occurred in the past could be used to perfectly predict 
future (sequences of) events. Reality, however, is ‘developmentally open’. Events occur 
in implementation, which are unforeseen. Thus, public and private managers can have 
(quite accurate) expectations about events, and they make plans for implementing projects 
(which are based on compressions of reality) to manage prospective events, but these 
plans cannot foresee all possible future eventualities. It means that projects and outcomes 
emerge in time and that implementations face uncertainty.
61	
Note that this is synchronic emergence. Whereas diachronic emergence assumes that a clear starting point 
of a sequence of events can be identified, synchronic emergence inherently accepts the limitations of man-
agers’ cognitive capacities. It stresses that no clear starting point of a sequence of events can be identified 
unambiguously (Teisman & Gerrits, 2014).

Part 5  |  Conclusions and discussion 
166
The time-asymmetric nature of implementation means that evaluation methods that 
ignore time are inadequate for understanding and evaluating implementation processes.62 
Because future events cannot be precisely calculated/predicted, someone has not necessar-
ily miscalculated and can be named a culprit (see also Section 1.5.3). Accepting this implies 
that evaluations should be used less for holding actors accountable or blaming and more 
for learning to adapt to changing conditions.
In the next section, lessons are drawn by briefly presenting the main empirical patterns 
of the complexity-informed QCA evaluations of the A2 Maastricht (see Chapters 4 and 
6), the A15 MaVa (see Chapters 5 and 6), and the twenty-seven project implementations 
(see Chapter 7).
8.3.	
The empirical reality of managing the 
complexity of project implementation
The implementations of the A2 Maastricht and the A15 MaVa projects were accompanied 
by multiple social and physical unforeseen events. It was found that social events dominate 
in the implementation challenge. When projects are implemented, stakeholders in the 
context (e.g., citizens, municipalities, provinces, and waterboards) react in various ways to 
the implementation. Often, this means that stakeholders refuse to approve of designs and 
permit applications by the project organization. Implementation managers in the projects 
respond to these reactions in order to minimize the impact on the construction and deliv-
ery process and on the desired outcomes.63 It was found that the satisfaction of managers 
with their responses takes various forms. In the implementation of complex infrastructure 
projects with heterogeneous participants and stakeholders, project success is not only 
about costs, time, and quality – the dominant measures in the project management and 
PPP infrastructure fields of research. It entails a wider variety of aspects. Two important 
additional aspects are stakeholder satisfaction and the public-private partnership relation 
itself (see also Chapter 7).64
The studies showed that managers often choose to use internally-oriented (closed, 
project-inward) responses; sometimes they use externally-oriented (open, project-outward) 
responses. The latter recognizes that the stakeholder context is to be managed by emerg-
ing and constructive interaction, and acts upon this recognition. This externally-oriented 
approach contributes to satisfactory outcomes. Shielding the project from the context, the 
dominant internally-oriented reaction, is less effective.

Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
Public and private managers can also choose to act more autonomously (acting alone), 
or to respond in a more cooperative fashion (acting together to solve an issue). The A2 
Maastricht and A15 MaVa studies showed that the cooperative approach contributes to 
more satisfaction.
3.	 Internally-oriented responses by the private partner are associated with low satis-
faction.
4.	 Internally-oriented responses by the public partner or in some form of public-
private cooperation are associated with high satisfaction.
From the four patterns (see also Table 6.1),65 lessons can be drawn. The patterns show that 
there are several ways for managers to yield satisfactory outcomes (patterns 2 and 4) or 
unsatisfactory outcomes (patterns 1 and 3). There is no single superior or inferior way for 
managers to respond to unforeseen events in project implementation; there are multiple 
ways.66 Managers will have to reflect on the choice they have to make; it is not the case 
that anything goes.
Internally-oriented management responses to social events are associated with low 
satisfaction (patterns 1 and 3). Externally-oriented management responses to social events 
are associated with high satisfaction (pattern 2). The simple lesson would be to prefer and 
prescribe an externally-oriented approach. However, an internally-oriented management 
approach can also be associated with high satisfaction, under the condition that the public 
and private partners cooperate in the response (pattern 4).67 That is, they have to apply 
a joint response to unforeseen events, or the public partner has to intermediate between 
the private partner and the project’s societal environment. Public-private cooperation 
is thus associated with high satisfaction (pattern 4). Non-cooperation, conversely, is as-
sociated with low satisfaction (pattern 3). The simple lesson could thus be to prefer and 
prescribe the cooperative approach. However, if management is externally-oriented, close

In Tosmana (Cronqvist, 2011), the software program that was used for the analyses of the A2 Maastricht 
and A15 MaVa projects, consistency and coverage scores are not produced. More recently, this option has 
become available in R (Thiem & Duşa, 2013c:​​Ch.5; Thiem, 2015). The consistency and coverage scores, 
derived with the QCA package in R (Duşa & Thiem, 2014), are as follows. For the patterns in Table 4.6 
(i.e., the results of the A2 Maastricht project): pattern [1] (incl. 1.000, cov.r 0.667), pattern [2A] (incl. 
1.000, cov.r 0.222, cov.u 0.222), pattern [2B] (incl. 1.000, cov.r 0.111, cov.u 0.111), and pattern 2[C] 
including the eight cases from the two contradictory rows (incl. 0.667, cov.r 0.667, cov.u 0.667). For the 
patterns in Table 5.7 (i.e., the final results of the A15 MaVa project): first pattern for SATIS{1} (incl. 1.000, 
cov.r 0.125, cov.u 0.125), second pattern for SATIS{1} (incl. 1.000, cov.r 0.875, cov.u 0.875), first pattern 
for SATIS{0} (incl. 1.000, cov.r 0.750, cov.u 0.417), and second pattern for SATIS{0} (incl. 1.000, cov.r 
0.583, cov.u 0.250).
66	
In other words, causality is characterized by equifinality.
67	
Note that the three minor patterns (i.e., the patterns covered by few cases), shown in Chapter 6, are taken 
together here in pattern 4 because they are logically compatible. This compatibility was confirmed by 
running the mvQCA for the 38 cases together in a single analysis (Cronqvist, 2011), which produced 
pattern 4. By taking these three minor patterns together, (1) whether events are social or physical of nature 
becomes redundant, and (2) ‘cooperation’ is abstracted further to ‘some involvement of the public partner’ 
instead of cooperation/​intermediation. Chapter 6 provides a more nuanced elaboration.

Part 5  |  Conclusions and discussion 
168
cooperation is not a necessity for achieving satisfaction (pattern 2). This tells us that the 
effectiveness of internally-oriented and non-cooperative responses may be increased by 
cooperative and externally-oriented approaches, respectively.
The comparison of the A2 Maastricht and A15 MaVa evaluations showed that the A2 
Maastricht project is more externally-oriented and cooperation-oriented. This seems to ex-
plain why outcomes in responding to events are generally more satisfactory. The A15 MaVa 
project is less externally-oriented and less cooperation-oriented. This goes hand in hand 
with the project’s less satisfactory outcomes in dealing with events in implementation. 
Two factors were identified in explaining the differences in management and cooperation 
orientations.
A.	 The implementations apply different PPP-models. The A15 MaVa implementation 
has a concessional model in a DBFM contract and the A2 Maastricht has more of 
an alliance-like model in a D&C contract.68 The first model stresses the boundar-
ies and division of responsibilities between the public and private partners and it 
incites an internally-oriented focus. The latter model stresses cooperation.69
B.	 The projects have different scopes. The A15 MaVa is purely a transportation project 
with few participants: the principal Rijkswaterstaat and the construction consor-
tium. The A2 Maastricht is an integral project where different local spatial func-
tions are combined, with hence multiple project stakeholders closely tied to each 
other: Rijkswaterstaat shares the clientship with local governments. This integrality 
of the project instigated cooperation and an external management orientation.
The evaluation of twenty-seven PPP infrastructure project implementations attempted to 
corroborate the findings from the A2 Maastricht and A15 MaVa studies. This medium-n 
evaluation cannot be a perfect match with the two project evaluations, because the data 
and data-collection strategy are of a different nature.70 Still, the patterns from the A2 
Maastricht and A15 MaVa studies are supported, and amended, by those of the medium-n 
study.
5.	 Projects with a broader scope and a D&C contract are characterized by externally-
oriented management and a cooperative orientation, and associated with high 
satisfaction.
6.	 Projects with a limited scope and a D&C contract are characterized by externally-
oriented management and a contractual orientation; this is also associated with 
high satisfaction.
68	
DBFM stands for Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain. D&C stands for Design and Construct.
69	
Another related but different distinction that can be found in the literature is between contractual PPPs 
(cPPP) and institutionalized PPPs (iPPP). See Marra (2007) and Da Cruz, Somões, and Marques (2013).
70	
Moreover, different and more conditions are included in the analysis which makes it unlikely that the 
patterns from the two project evaluations are exactly reproduced.

169
Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
7.	 Large projects with a limited scope and a D&C contract are characterized by a 
contractual orientation; this is also associated with high satisfaction.
8.	 Large projects with a limited scope are characterized by externally-oriented man-
agement and a cooperative orientation, and this is associated with high satisfaction.
Comparing these four patterns with those from the A2 Maastricht and A15 MaVa evalua-
tions, several conclusions can be drawn. First, the patterns confirm that there are indeed 
multiple ways of management responses that yield satisfactory outcomes (patterns 5 to 
8). Moreover, externally-oriented management (patterns 5, 6, and 8) and a cooperative 
orientation (patterns 5 and 8) are indeed associated with high satisfaction. Patterns 6 and 
7, however, indicate that a contractual orientation can be associated with high satisfaction 
as well, in projects with a limited scope. Furthermore, pattern 5 supports the explana-
tion that an integral (i.e., broad) project scope could instigate a cooperative and external 
management orientation,71 resulting in high satisfaction.72 Put alternatively, larger and 
integral projects may require externally-oriented and cooperative orientations more than 
smaller and/or limited-scope projects. The patterns from the medium-n evaluation show 
that different kinds of PPP infrastructure projects may require different management ap-
proaches to achieve satisfactory outcomes in implementation.
The empirical findings of the evaluations in Chapters 4 to 7 do not provide contra-
dictory evidence. Rather, they indicate that externally-oriented management and closer 
public-private cooperation are generally a ‘safer bet’ for achieving satisfaction in imple-
menting PPP infrastructure projects. Additionally, in specific cases – whether on the level 
of responding to unforeseen events in projects (Chapters 4 to 6) or on the project level as 
a whole (Chapter 7) – other management and cooperation approaches may suffice as well. 
These findings can inform the planning and implementation of other (future) projects, as 
will be discussed in Section 8.5.2.
8.4.	
The complexity-informed nature of QCA
If we want to improve other (future) implementation processes of projects, this requires 
evaluation. Evaluation can facilitate learning in and across implementation processes of 
PPP infrastructure projects. Section 8.5.1 discusses how QCA can be used for learning in 
practical situations, utilizing it as a collaborative, interactive and systematic evaluation 
instrument, making tacit knowledge in projects explicit.
A precondition for this is that the method and application have to create a realistic 
understanding of the implementation being evaluated. It means that the evaluation meth-
71	
Or, at least, they do not disconfirm this. The contract type (D&C or DBFM) and the integrality of a project 
are at best proxies for the more detailed explanations provided in Chapter 6.
72	
Similarly, Nijkamp, Van der Burch, and Vindigni (2002) found that urban PPP projects, with joint-​venture 
models and a broad scope, are likely to be more successful.

170
odology needs to be complexity-informed. This implies that it has to meet the following 
four requirements (see also Section 8.2).
1.	 Non-decomposability: because outcomes in/of project implementations emerge 
from interactions between elements, the method has to be able to evaluate how 
combinations of elements explain outcomes.
2.	 Contingent reality: because context is explanatory for how outcomes in/of project 
implementations emerge, the method has to be able to evaluate the role of context 
in explaining outcomes. Specifically, because context is systemic and dynamic, it 
has to be capable of:
	
	
a.	 Identifying project peculiarities that explain outcomes in/of cases, and 
exploring and identifying patterns in/across cases.73
	
	
b.	 Limited generalization, recognizing that patterns’ explanatory values may 
not apply to all cases at all times.
3.	 Non-compressibility: because managers in project implementations act based on 
different simplifications of their project reality, the evaluation method has to be 
able to include these different project realities in the explanation of outcomes.
4.	 Time-asymmetry: because causality is emergent, the evaluation method has to be 
capable of capturing the time dimension in explaining outcomes.74 It also implies 
that it has to accept that perfect prediction of events and outcomes is not possible.
The first requisite is met. QCA is a decidedly configurational approach. This means 
that it assumes that causality is configurational. In QCA, cases (such as implementation 
processes or events in implementation processes) are conceptualized as combinations of 
conditions (i.e., configurations), and these configurations explain an outcome. Although 
the results of an evaluation with QCA may point to singular conditions being associated 
with the outcome, QCA assumes a priori that configurations, and not single conditions, 
produce outcomes. The results of an analysis show the evaluator which configurations.
The second requirement is met. A qualitative comparative analysis starts from the 
premise that projects are unique and implemented in a unique context. The method is 
decidedly case-based, assuming that the unique properties could hold explanations for the 
outcome of interest. Each implementation is first researched in-depth on various project 
and context-specific properties. The coding of the cases on specific conditions thereafter 
results in a data matrix. Via the grouping of cases in a truth table, the comparison (i.e., 
minimization of the truth table) then explicates the patterns in/across them. Basically, the 
QCA evaluation process can be imagined in terms of the aforementioned T-structure.75 
This is shown in Figure 8.1. The ‘leg’ of the T is the qualitative study of cases, and via the

The importance of this was also pointed to by Marsden and Stead (2011) in their review of policy transfer 
and learning in the field of transport research.

Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
data matrix, the truth table, and then the minimized patterns, the evaluator has arrived 
at the ‘roof’ of the T. S/he has made tacit knowledge and implicit patterns in/across cases 
explicit. Once there, s/he has to look down (back) again to be able to explain the expli-
cated patterns.76 In this way, the QCA process allows the evaluator to iterate between case 
peculiarities and generic patterns. Importantly, because the studied cases group together 
in different configurations,77 limited generalizability of patterns is implied in the method: 
a pattern only applies to the subset of cases covered by the pattern.
The third requirement is met. QCA in itself does not necessarily imply that the differ-
ences between project actors are included in explaining the patterns and outcomes, but 
it certainly does not rule out this option. The case-based nature of the method means 
that implementations can be evaluated as cases in various ways. Textbooks on case study 
research abound, exemplifying a wide variety of case study approaches, methods, and tech-
niques including inductive, grounded approaches. Therefore, QCA can be applied in a 
grounded way, constructing cases via an inductive process, starting with the perceptions of 
managers in project implementations. By doing so, as little as possible of the complexity of 
reality is compressed at the start of the evaluation. In this respect, the complexity-informed 
approach to QCA deviates from many conventional approaches to, and applications of, 
the method. Whereas conventional approaches often start with theoretical frameworks so 
as to select and define cases and conditions, the complexity-informed approach to QCA 
postpones simplification and starts with the empirical observations of the actors in the 
projects.78

The fourth requisite is partly met. In essence, the time dimension is not captured in the 
method. Cases as configurations are compared at a certain point in time, not through time. 
Although a number of proposals are available to include time in QCA,79 the approach is 
not a longitudinal one that is able to capture the complex dynamics of implementation 
processes in its systematic comparative procedures. In the analyses of the A2 Maastricht 
and A15 MaVa implementations, the temporality of events-responses-outcomes was taken 
into account by ensuring in the qualitative coding process that events occurred before 
management responses, after which outcomes were produced. Nevertheless, the outcomes 
in/of implementations are synchronized with the sequences of events from which they 
emerged,80 at the very moment a data matrix is constructed. If evaluators seek to sys-
tematically disclose how sequences of events gave rise to outcomes in/of implementation 
processes, and are not willing to accept a workaround solution to the time problem, other 
research approaches may be preferred.81
However, the notion of an unfolding reality, and the uncertainty about future events 
and outcomes that this implies, is supported in QCA. This part of the fourth requisite 
is met. Conventionally, the method is applied so as to identify necessary and sufficient 
(combinations of) conditions for outcomes. This nomenclature signals the deterministic 
nature of QCA,82 which could be construed as that uncertainty is actually not allowed 
by QCA. However, in the complexity-informed approach to QCA, associations between 
configurations and outcomes are not causally deterministic – causal in the ontological 
sense – but logically deterministic.83 Configurations can, and often have, contradictory 
outcomes; the relationships between conditions and outcomes in/of projects are not lin-
ear; and generalization is limited. These properties of QCA make clear that the notion of 
uncertainty of causal relations is supported in QCA. This is an important and realistic, but 
not often desired, insight. In an attempt to diminish the uncertainty, patterns of associa-
tions identified with a QCA evaluation provide clear and communicable suggestions for 
improvements of infrastructure development implementation,84 e.g., externally-oriented 
management and public-private cooperation. These are, however, not laws cast in stone.85

Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
8.5.	
Towards learning in implementation
In this penultimate section, the intensions of the thesis are revisited, discussing a number 
of (potential) implications for evaluation (Section 8.5.1) and implementation management 
(Section 8.5.2).
8.5.1.	
An agenda for learning from evaluation with QCA
When policy-makers, decision-makers, managers, or academics refer to the evaluation of 
infrastructure projects, they often refer to ex-ante project evaluation. Infrastructure project 
appraisal methods such as environmental impact assessment, multi-criteria analysis, and 
especially cost-benefit analysis – and in the case of PPP projects, to an increasing degree 
methods such as the public sector comparator – are now commonly applied in planning 
for infrastructure projects (see, e.g., Bristow & Nellthorp, 2000; Browne & Ryan, 2011; 
Grant-Muller, MacKie, Nellthorp, & Pearman, 2001; Grimsey & Lewis, 2005; Hayashi & 
Morisugi, 2000; Vickerman, 2007). Because expectations and intentions in planning can 
easily fail in implementation, evaluation of the implementation phase is, however, at least 
equally important. Evaluations can contribute to learning how (future) implementation 
processes of PPP infrastructure projects can be improved (e.g., EVA-TREN, 2008). This 
requires first that the evaluation method and application take into account the systemic 
complexity of implementation. This aspect of narrowing the implementation-evaluation 
gap was addressed in this thesis by establishing and applying QCA as a complexity-
informed evaluation approach. Other aspects of narrowing the gap are that evaluations are 
conducted in the first place, and that the results of evaluations are used in practice. This 
section proposes an agenda to further increase learning in and of project implementation 
processes with QCA.
8.5.1.1.	 Intensified evaluation practice through academia-practice partnerships
Post-contract evaluation in transport infrastructure development receives insufficient at-
tention (cf. Short & Kopp, 2005). Due to its low position on the public agenda, data are 
often not collected, data are fragmented or lacking quality, or organizations do not or 
insufficiently allocate resources (e.g., time, budget, skills, or experience) to evaluation (cf. 
Pattyn, 2014). The fear that evaluation results are used to hold implementers accountable 
for poor performances can also explain the lack of implementation evaluation (Short & 
Kopp, 2005; Torres & Preskill, 2001).86 The implementation of transportation infrastruc-
ture projects therefore continues to be based on personal, though unsystematically ana-
lyzed, preferences, experiences, and expectations (cf. Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006; Rousseau, 
2006) that are possibly inefficient, ineffective, or obstructive to project implementation, 
without practitioners knowing or acknowledging this.

These reasons were also conjectured in personal communications between the researcher and managers and 
strategic advisors within Rijkswaterstaat.

It is therefore important that real data from current and past projects are systemati-
cally collected and analyzed, so as to verify whether and which past experiences contribute 
to project implementation (cf. Sager, 2007).87 This evidence can be the knowledge base for 
future learning. The significance of learning from the past is even larger in current times 
of breaking down infrastructure development into sequential and parallel projects,88 where 
managers rush from one project to the next. The current trend of outsourcing manage-
ment tasks – e.g., not all managers of Rijkswaterstaat projects are Rijkswaterstaat staff (or 
‘Waterstaters’) – further challenges the learning of projects, because gained knowledge 
and experiences leave once projects are finished (cf. Lei & Hitt, 1995). Individual people 
learn, but new managers will start ‘from scratch’. The knowledge gained in the projects is 
partial and not automatically institutionalized on the organizational level to inform the 
planning and implementation of future projects (Bakker, Cambré, Korlaar, & Raab, 2011; 
Boh, 2007; Cooper, Lyneis, & Bryant, 2002). More systematic evaluation is thus needed.
The potentials for systematic evaluation are there, but largely unrealized. Rijkswater-
staat collects qualitative and quantitative project data on a periodic basis about a wide 
variety of conditions – e.g., budget, planning, risks, project context, contractual issues, 
personnel, quality, and scope. These data are used for project accounting, but hardly for 
evaluation.89 There seems to be an underdeveloped evaluation culture in the implemen-
tation domain.90 One way to accomplish intensified post-contract evaluation of (PPP) 
transportation infrastructure projects (cf. Siemiatycki, 2009) is to create a partnership 
between practice and academia to take up the evaluation challenge (e.g., Verweij et al., 
2015; Chapter 7). In this way, researchers can gain real project data to evaluate (Short & 
Kopp, 2005), and public organizations can use the research resources (e.g., time, budget, 
experience) for their own learning (cf. Torres & Preskill, 2001). Such a partnership be-
tween academia and practice (e.g., Verweij et al., 2015; Chapter 7) could help closing the 
gap between implementation and evaluation.
The partnerships in evaluation should consist of academics, public procurers, stake-
holders from the environment, and private contractors (e.g., Bressers, 2011). The inclusion 
of the variety of actors in the evaluation is important for three reasons. First, infrastructure 
projects are implemented in a context of heterogonous stakeholders and managed by 
heterogeneous public and private actors. These project stakeholders and participants draw 
specific boundaries. That is, they have partial knowledge. By including a multitude of 
actors and perspectives in the evaluation, the data, knowledge, and experience base – the 
evidence base – can be broadened and strengthened (cf. Chapters 2 and 3 on negotiated 
87	
Note that QCA can only be applied to real (i.e., non-​artificial, non-​simulated) data because case-​knowledge 
is required in the QCA process. See, e.g., Ragin (2014) and Olson (2014) for recent arguments against 
using simulated data in QCA. See also Byrne and Callaghan (2013:​​51-​55).
88	
This is also referred to as the ‘projectification’ of infrastructure development (cf. Maylor, Brady, Cooke-​
Davies, & Hodgson, 2006).
89	
This is derived from personal communications with a strategic advisor and a project management specialist 
within Rijkswaterstaat, who both are concerned with training and learning in the organization. This com-
munication took place during the employment as a visiting researcher at Rijkswaterstaat (see Chapter 7).

subjectivism).91 Second, a collaborative evaluation process may lead to increased interac-
tion, trust, consensus, and mutual learning (see, e.g., Bryson, Crosby, & Stone, 2006; 
Greene, 2001). This can improve the quality of cooperation, contributing to the satisfac-
tion of outcomes (Section 8.3). Third, knowledge that is co-created becomes immediately 
part of a feedback loop into the practice that is being evaluated, thus enhancing evaluation 
utilization and learning (Patton, 2011).
In sum, more systematic evaluation is needed, and creating partnerships between 
stakeholders, public, private, and academic actors in the evaluation process is important 
to increase the learning potential of evaluations (cf. Edelenbos & Van Buuren, 2005; Van 
der Meer & Edelenbos, 2006). It is proposed here that qualitative comparative analysis can 
be instrumental to this purpose.
8.5.1.2.	Qualitative comparative analysis as a collaborative and interactive learning tool 
for evaluation92
The QCA approach can be a valuable addition to the evaluation toolbox (Stern et al., 
2012). It has been proposed in the evaluation literature before (see Section 1.5.2),93 inter 
alia as a method for realistic evaluation (Befani & Sager, 2006; Befani et al., 2007; Sager 
& Andereggen, 2012). This section adds to this literature by proposing QCA as an ap-
proach for collaborative and interactive evaluation (cf. Varone et al., 2006).94 As such, 
it can be a valuable tool for learning. Its grounded and dialogical nature (e.g., Fritzsche, 
2014; Rantala & Hellström, 2001) facilitates the inclusion of, and interaction between, 
a multitude of heterogeneous actors and perspectives. Additionally, its comparative and 
systematic procedures allow the variety of data, knowledge, and experiences (evidence) 
to be compressed in a communicable, generalized format. This is important for utiliza-
tion (Greene, 1988), but often lacking in interactive and dialogical types of evaluation 
(Edelenbos & Van Eeten, 2001).
There are three dimensions of learning with QCA.95 This is depicted in Figure 8.2. The 
first involves learning across projects. The cases being compared are projects or project 
implementations (e.g., Chapter 7). Cross-project comparison tells us what kinds of proj-
ects require what kind of implementation management, and how projects can be managed 
more effectively by adapting lessons from successful cases.96 For instance, the analysis in 
91	
In other words, a quadruple helix brings a variety of tacit knowledge together and gives evaluators the 
opportunity to create explicated knowledge in a systematic way.
92	
For this subsection, some basic knowledge about QCA is assumed, which can be acquired by studying the 
previous chapters.
93	
See also Gerrits and Verweij (Accepted).
94	
The proposal outlined here is informed by a QCA experience with multiple researchers (i.e., Verweij, Klijn, 
Edelenbos, & Van Buuren, 2013).
95	
Similarly, Rihoux and Lobe (2009) state that cases can be macro-​, meso-​, or micro-​level.
96	
Importantly, as Marsden and Stead (2011) rightly suggest, lessons learnt should not be adopted but rather 
adapted to other cases because cases’ different contexts may influence, e.g., the effects sorted by certain 
management strategies. What (not) works in one context does not necessarily (not) work in other contexts 
(Engwall, 2003; Chapters 2 and 3), as the empirical results of this thesis also indicate (Chapters 4 to 7).

Part 5  |  Conclusions and discussion 
176
Chapter 7 showed that large, integral projects (broad scope) may require a cooperative 
management orientation (see Section 8.3): configurations 31 and 32 in the truth table 
(Table 7.2) illustrate that the same type of project (D&C contract, broad scope, and 
large size) has a higher satisfaction with a cooperative orientation (configuration 32), than 
without (configuration 31). This suggests that the projects of configuration 31 may have to 
adapt their cooperation strategy so as to achieve more satisfactory outcomes.97
The second dimension is learning within projects, by comparing events or situations 
within a project implementation (e.g., Chapters 4 and 5). This tells the project managers 
what kinds of situations require what kind of management, and how adapting their man-
agement strategy may generate better outcomes. For instance (see Chapter 6), managers 
that responded to social events with internally-oriented management are advised to adapt: 
either they respond externally-oriented in future cases, or public and private managers 
respond jointly (see Section 8.3).
The third dimension concerns learning about project participants’ perspectives 
in a project – with regard to the project or events/situations within a project (see Fig-
ure 8.2) – by comparing these perspectives on certain aspects. Each participant is a case 
97	
Metaphorically speaking, the truth table can be imagined as an n-​dimensional space or landscape where 
some coordinates are associated with higher performance and other coordinates with lower performance. 
The distance between two coordinates in the landscape is defined by the number of conditions in which two 
configurations in the truth table differ. Actors might alter their strategies (e.g., cooperative orientation) so 
as to ‘move to’ a different coordinate on the landscape to gain higher performance. Future methodological 
research might study the links between QCA and the notion of fitness or performance landscapes (cf. 
Poon, Chan, Poon, & Land, 2013). See Gerrits and Marks (OnlineFirst) for an overview of fitness and 
performance landscapes in the social sciences.

(cf. Kort, Verweij, & Klijn, Accepted). For example, instead of comparing events in a 
project, each manager’s perspective of the event with regard to how it was managed can be 
studied. Comparison of perspectives tells the participants where there is common ground 
or mutual understanding between them (i.e., when managers are positioned in the same 
or similar truth table rows), or where perspectives diverge. The assessment of similar and 
dissimilar perspectives can show where consensus between participants can be harnessed, 
and where differences can be sought to be bridged.
Collaboration and interaction between the evaluation participants occurs throughout 
the QCA process, due to the dialogue between ideas and evidence that characterizes QCA 
(see, e.g., Berg-Schlosser et al., 2009; Ragin, 1987). This is shown in Figure 8.3. As the 
figure depicts, the process consists of four steps: casing, calibration (data matrix), truth 
table analysis, and dealing with contradictions.
The first step, ‘casing’ (see Carter & Sealey, 2009; Ragin, 1992), is the initial construc-
tion of cases. Various project data, project experiences, and project knowledge are shared 
between the evaluation participants. More precisely, casing involves the construction 
of cases as configurations of conditions (cf. Byrne, 2005) by using empirical evidence. 
The decision as to which conditions are to be included in the evaluation is part of the 
discussion (grounded), thereby taking into account that participants may have different 
perspectives and ideas about this (Patton, 2008). If conditions would be predefined by 
the evaluator, participants might take obstructive attitudes towards the evaluation and its 
results instead of using it and learning from it (Patton, 2008). The grounded casing also 
ensures that as little as possible of the complexity of the cases is compressed at the start of 
the evaluation. This is important for a broad evidence base for learning. Basically, this step

answers the question as to what is/are the outcome(s) of interest, and which conditions 
could explain the outcome(s).
The second step is calibration, where the case constructions by the participants have to 
be quantified into a data matrix. Each row in the data matrix represents a case. Each case 
is scored on the selected conditions that constitute the case. By quantifying the cases, tacit 
knowledge of projects (first dimension), in projects (second dimension), and of perspectives 
(third dimension) is made explicit. The quantification forces the evaluation participants to 
reflect upon and explicate their knowledge and perspectives of/on the conditions. In this 
calibration process, interaction occurs between the participants from different projects, 
in events, or with different perspectives: because of the case-comparative nature of QCA, 
they have to reach agreement on the scales used for scoring the cases. Multiple options are 
available that accommodate different scales for scoring cases on the conditions: crisp-set 
QCA, multi-value QCA, and fuzzy-set QCA (see, e.g., Rihoux & Ragin, 2009a; Schneider 
& Wagemann, 2012). If participants disagree about the score of a project or event on a 
certain condition or outcome, a fuzzy scale ranging from 0 to 1 can accommodate the 
diverging views of the participants regarding these conditions/outcomes. Alternatively, 
if a participant is a case, fuzzy or multi-value scores can accommodate participant views 
that are not simply expressed in a binary (‘yes or no’) fashion (e.g., Kort et al., Accepted). 
Basically, the second step answers the question as to how the different cases score on the 
outcome and the conditions.
The third step, as shown in Figure 8.3, is the construction and analysis of the truth 
table. The rows in the truth table represent the various different combinations of condi-
tions (configurations) that are possible. The construction of the truth table involves the 
grouping of cases: projects, events, or perspectives that are similar are positioned in the 
same row. It means that a variety of data, knowledge, and experiences is compressed into 
patterns. The analysis highlights the similarities and dissimilarities (cf. Ragin & Amoroso, 
2011) across cases. The truth table is a tool that explicates the different options for adapting 
lessons from successful cases (first and second dimensions of learning) to improve other 
(future) cases (cf. Bakker et al., 2011), or where consensus between perspectives can be 
harnessed and where differences can be bridged (third dimension of learning).
It often occurs that a truth table row is a logical contradiction: the same configuration 
is associated with both the outcome in some cases and the negation of the outcome in 
other cases (see, e.g., Table 4.5).98 As a fourth step, this contradiction has to be dealt with. 
It requires that the evaluation participants return to the previous steps of the QCA process 
(see Figure 8.3). There are multiple ways of dealing with contradictions (see, e.g., Rihoux 
& De Meur, 2009). For instance, a contradiction can signal that an additional condition 
explains the different outcomes of the similar cases (casing). Alternatively, it may signal 
that previous scorings of cases (calibration) – projects, events in projects, or participant 
perspectives – have to be revisited. In this way, the occurrence of contradictions enforces 
iterations between the steps in the QCA process. This is shown with the bottom arrows 
98	
In fsQCA, contradictions are indicated by lower consistency scores of truth table rows (cf. Rubinson, 
2013).

179
Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
in Figure 8.3. It requires that new evidence is brought to the table and discussed, thereby 
further increasing interaction and collaboration between participants.
When the contradictions are solved, the truth table can be minimized. The mini-
mization is the final compression in the QCA process. It results in a generalized pattern 
(i.e., the solution formula) using Boolean algebra. Several examples of these generalized 
patterns can be found in the empirical chapters of this thesis (Chapters 4, 5, and 7). The 
patterns communicate the substantive results of the evaluation process, showing what the 
core conditions or perspectives are that explain the outcome of interest.
The dialogical QCA process of knowledge co-creation started with a variety of data, 
knowledge, and experiences, which are gradually compressed – via the construction of the 
data matrix and subsequently the truth table (see also Figure 8.1) – into a communicable, 
generalized format.99 In the process, tacit knowledge has been explicated in a transparent 
and systematic manner.
This thesis has established and applied QCA as a complexity-informed approach, 
thereby narrowing the gap between implementation and evaluation. This section has 
additionally proposed QCA as a collaborative and interactive approach for evaluating 
infrastructure PPP project implementation processes, so as to further narrow this gap. 
Its true worth as such for learning from evaluation, however, has to be tested in future 
evaluation practices.
8.5.2.	
Managing project implementation processes: boundaries in public-private 
partnerships
Empirical patterns such as in Section 8.3 are not deterministically causal. Each case is 
unique; simply adopting (copying) ‘best practices’ can lead to disappointing outcomes 
because cases have different public-private-context relations. The context matters. The 
patterns, however, can help to serve learning. They do provide clues – they are a ‘flashlight’ 
(Rihoux, 2003) – as to where improvements in implementation strategies can be found. A 
number of improvements are discussed here.
8.5.2.1.	Public-private boundaries in implementation
Public-private partnerships can be found in many forms, types, uses, and meanings 
(e.g., Klijn, 2010; Linder, 1999; Schaeffer & Loveridge, 2002; Weihe, 2008a; Wettenhal, 
2003). A dominant type in PPP discussions is the DBFM concessional model (Reynaers, 
2014). On the spectrum from wholly public sector projects (i.e., public sector procure-
ment) to wholly private sector projects (i.e., privatization), DBFM is often positioned 
somewhere in the middle (Bult-Spiering & Dewulf, 2006; Koppenjan, 2008; Kwak et 
99	
The QCA process adheres to the ‘logic of discovery’ (see Chapter 2) which incites reflexivity and interaction 
in evaluative processes (Patton, 2011:​283-​287). This logic is “built around a dialogue process of discovery. 
The dialogue is back and forth between possibilities (hypotheses) and explanations, with observations 
(data) mediating the dialogue” (Patton, 2011:​​286).

Part 5  |  Conclusions and discussion 
180
al., 2009; Yescombe, 2007). This could imply that it is the ultimate type of public-private 
partnership. However, the contracting-out nature of DBFM contracts is in sharp contrast 
with the idea of a true partnership between the public and private parties, where public 
and private partners cooperate – cooperation in the sense of interactive processes of joint 
problem-solving – in implementing a transportation infrastructure project (Klijn & Teis-
man, 2000a; 2005; Teisman & Klijn, 2002).100
The study in Chapter 5 supports the view that the DBFM concessional model gener-
ates clear boundaries between the public and private partners in terms of their tasks, 
roles, risks, and responsibilities (Eversdijk & Korsten, 2008; Klijn & Teisman, 2000a; 
2005). This model is increasing in popularity. Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch major public 
procurer of transportation infrastructure, provides a case in point.101 It is guided by the 
principle ‘the market unless’ (see Goverde, 2012; Metze, 2010; Van den Brink, 2009). The 
principle dictates that the market is responsible for implementation. Rijkswaterstaat as 
the public principal takes a backseat position in implementation. Keeping this distance to 
implementation, and a clear contractual division of tasks, roles, risks, and responsibilities, 
serves government’s desire to safeguard the separation of public and private accountability 
and by doing so creating transparency in PPPs. Monitoring and control mechanisms, not 
cooperation, then become the instruments applied by the public principals (Forrer, Kee, 
Newcomer, & Boyer, 2010; Reynaers & De Graaf, 2014).
This research (see Chapters 4 and 5) on implementation processes of transportation 
infrastructure projects, however, highlights the need for cooperation in unpredictable and 
dynamic socio-physical contexts, especially for achieving satisfactory outcomes in proj-
ects with broader scopes (Chapter 7). Cooperation requires that the clear public-private 
boundaries are crossed.102 It points to the need for managing project implementations not 
‘to the letter’ but ‘in the spirit’ of the contract (Da Cruz et al., 2013). Whereas the first 
incites contractual discussions about which partner was responsible for risks that occurred 
(e.g., the A15 MaVa project), the latter accepts that in the face of project uncertainty and 
dynamics, the public and private partners must be flexible, setting aside public-private 
differences when a situation requires it, thus operating side-to-side to manage ongoing 
issues that often will arise during implementation (e.g., the A2 Maastricht project) (cf. 
D’Alessandro, Bailey, & Giorgino, 2014; Da Cruz & Marques, 2012).103
It is suggested in the literature that alliance-like PPP models are more likely to allow 
managing ‘in the spirit’ of the contract (see, e.g., De Brux, 2010). Empirical Dutch cases 
indicate that alliance might help to deal with uncertain, heterogeneous, and dynamic 
100	 See also, e.g., Lawther and Martin (2014:​222-​223).

102	 Put differently, rigid contract structures are to be relaxed (cf. Chapters 4 and 6) so as to achieve satisfactory 
outcomes that are best-​for-​project (cf. Cruz & Marques, 2013; Da Cruz et al., 2013; Sakal, 2005).
103	 It is argued that, because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of events in projects, PPP con-
tracts are incomplete by definition. This requires management ‘in the spirit’ of the contract as opposed to 
‘to the letter’ of the contract. Whereas the first allows for renegotiation and problem-​solving, the latter is 
more rigid and sticks to the contract thus creating contractual conflicts (see De Brux, 2010).

181
Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
stakeholder environments (e.g., Neele, 2003). Alliance-like PPPs, such as the A2 Maastricht 
project (Chapter 4), allow cooperation across public-private boundaries (see Chapter 6). 
The focus is less on monitoring and control mechanisms, and more on breaking down 
public-private organizational barriers (Grimsey & Lewis, 2004), thus pooling public and 
private resources (e.g., skills or experience) to manage arising and ongoing issues. Atten-
tion is centered on the project and not on the individual partners (Grimsey & Lewis, 
2004). Table 8.1 summarizes differences between the two models.
A specific aspect at which the public-private boundaries discussion becomes apparent 
is stakeholder management in implementation.104 The current trend seems to be that the 
public-private boundaries drawn in PPP transportation infrastructure implementation 
delegate most responsibilities for stakeholder management to the private consortium (cf. 
Eversdijk & Korsten, 2008; Verweij et al., 2014). This is evident in the DBFM model (see 
Chapter 5). This leaves untapped, however, the potential strength of PPPs to cooperate 
across public-private boundaries (see Table 8.1), pooling public and private resources to 
manage arising and ongoing stakeholder issues in implementation.
An important resource is the public principal’s relationships with stakeholders in the 
socio-physical system with which the project interacts. Public principals, such as Rijkswa-
terstaat, are often longstanding governmental organizations that are part of established, 
institutionalized (local) networks of actors. These networks consist of, inter alia, political 
organizations, permitting authorities (e.g., municipalities, provinces, waterboards, and 
port authorities), and citizen and business groups (Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004), as can be 
seen in the A2 Maastricht and A15 MaVa projects (Chapters 4 and 5). Private construction 
consortia are not part of these established networks.105 Rather, they are ad hoc visitors (or 
more negatively: intruders) to the socio-physical system (Verweij et al., 2014). This means 
that private partners have less-developed relationships with the stakeholder environment. 
Because the public principal has more-developed relationships with the local stakeholders, 
it is better able to anticipate and respond to arising stakeholder-related issues (cf. Klijn 
& Teisman, 2000a). This can be seen in the A2 Maastricht and A15 MaVa projects. For 
104	 In Dutch, this is often referred to as omgevingsmanagement.

instance, in the A2 Maastricht, when a local vocational school objected to the phasing 
of a road bypass, the public manager, who was familiar with the school and its interests, 
successfully engaged in a negotiation process with the school (see Chapter 4). In contrast, 
Rijkswaterstaat in the A15 MaVa DBFM project implementation initially did not use 
its standing relationships with local stakeholders to its maximum potential (Chapter 5). 
Whereas it had the more-developed relationships with stakeholders, the clear division of 
tasks, roles, and responsibilities was stressed instead: private consortium A-Lanes A15 was 
initially left alone to manage stakeholders-related issues. Only later did Rijkswaterstaat 
step forward (it crossed the public-private boundary) to intermediate between the stake-
holders and the private consortium, after which the difficult relationship between A-Lanes 
A15 and the stakeholders improved.
This discussion shows that in projects implemented in uncertain, heterogeneous, and 
dynamic stakeholder environments, careful consideration is needed about which partner 
has the best skills for stakeholder management (cf. De Schepper et al., 2014). In contrast to 
what is often desired in DBFM, this is not necessarily the private partner. The task of, and 
responsibility for, stakeholder management in transportation infrastructure project imple-
mentation should not necessarily be (fully) transferred to the private sector (cf. Leendertse 
& Arts, 2013). Especially in larger, multifaceted implementation processes, tasks, roles, 
and responsibilities for stakeholder management may be allocated to the public principal, 
or the public and private partners may organize stakeholder management in an alliance-
like manner, as in the A2 Maastricht project (cf. De Schepper et al., 2014).
This is not to say that the DBFM concessional model should be abandoned (cf. 
Chapter 7). Rather, in light of the increasing popularity of the DBFM model, both in 
the Netherlands (Reynaers, 2014) and beyond (see Siemiatycki, 2009),106 this discussion 
raises the question as to how the specific public-private boundaries should be drawn in 
DBFM project implementation (cf. Eversdijk & Korsten, 2008).107 The suggestion here 
is that the strengths of DBFM can be combined with those of the alliance-model (see 
Table 8.1), by way of organizing stakeholder management in an alliance embedded in a 
DBFM project.108 This can improve project implementation processes, especially when 
the stakeholder environment is more complex, i.e., heterogeneous and dynamic. Future 
practices and research may further enquire into this option.
8.5.2.2.	Public-private-context boundaries in implementation
The discussion in the previous subsection focused on the boundaries between the public 
and private project partners. Implementation also concerns the inclusion and exclusion of 
stakeholders. This boundary between the public-private partnership on the one hand, and 
106	 This concessional type of PPP closely resembles the DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, and Operate) or DB-
FMO (Design, Build, Finance, Maintain, and Operate) contract (Bult-​Spiering & Dewulf, 2006; Grimsey 
& Lewis, 2004; Yescombe, 2007).

Chapter 8  |  Conclusions and discussion
the stakeholder context on the other, will have to be dealt with effectively. An important 
question is who gets to participate and how (De Schepper et al., 2014; Verweij et al., 2014).
In the A15 MaVa project, local stakeholders were more excluded from the process (see 
Chapters 5 and 6; Verweij et al., 2014). In the A2 Maastricht project, they were much more 
included, especially by the Municipality of Maastricht (see Chapters 4 and 6; Verweij, 
2012a). Implementation can thus vary in how stakeholders and their interests are included. 
This can be understood as the paradoxical choice between internalizing and externalizing 
contextual complexities (cf. Verweij & Gerrits, 2011). Internalizing means that stakeholder 
interests and interactions become an organized part of implementation processes. It leads 
to a more complex perceived implementation process, but it also means that the interests 
become more visible and easier to anticipate and respond to: uncertainty might decrease 
(cf. Aaltonen, Kujala, Lehtonen, & Ruuska, 2010; Ward & Chapman, 2008). In the 
A2 Maastricht project, for instance, regular meetings with citizens and businesses were 
organized to inform them, simultaneously informing the managers about the concerns 
of the local community. This allowed them to anticipate these concerns. Externalizing 
the stakeholders can be considered as attractive because it creates a simpler perceived 
implementation as fewer actors and interactions are part of it, but it can imply a less-
developed ‘stakeholder antenna’ thus increasing uncertainty (cf. Gerrits, 2012; Pel, 2009; 
Verweij et al., 2014). Stakeholder exclusion can create delays and overruns (cf. De Hoo, 
1982; e.g., Chapter 5) when stakeholders become active themselves without invitation. In 
the A15 MaVa project, for example (see Table 5.1), citizens’ interests were voiced via local 
municipalities that were not included in the public-private partnership (an unforeseen 
event), resulting in the temporary stoppage of piling works. Table 8.2 summarizes differ-
ences between stakeholder inclusion and exclusion.
This dilemma between internalizing and externalizing can be understood as achiev-
ing balance between control and co-creation (cf. Edelenbos et al., 2009; Hertogh & 
Westerveld, 2010). The classical challenge is to draw the initial participation boundaries 
and redraw them when needed before stakeholders in the context react against the project 
(cf. Boons, Van Buuren, Gerrits, & Teisman, 2009:244-245; Verweij et al., 2014). Litera-
ture indicates that more complex project contexts (environments) need more complexified 
implementation approaches (cf. Boisot & McKelvey, 2011; Morgan, 2006:33-71). Future 
research will have to delve into the public-private configurations of tasks, roles, risks, 
and responsibilities that are most effective for achieving this balance in different project 
contexts (cf. Verweij et al., 2013).
Note that stakeholder participation in infrastructure implementation is lower than in 
many spatial planning processes (El-Gohary et al., 2006). In the planning literature, many 
authors agree that open, more inclusive, participatory public consultation processes are 
favorable over closed, technical, non-participatory processes (e.g., Booth & Richardson, 
2001; Edelenbos & Klijn, 2006; Forester, 1999; Healey, 1997; Innes & Booher, 2010; 
Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004; Verweij et al., 2013). It is argued that open and participatory 
approaches increase accountability, democratic legitimacy, innovativeness, and richness of 
solutions (e.g., Lenferink, Tillema, & Arts, 2013a), and also performance. In the domain

of infrastructure project implementation, once the shovel hits the ground, it is assumed 
that less internalization is needed. Some studies (Dimitriou et al., 2013) indicate that 
in the pre-implementation phase projects should be treated as open systems for reasons 
such as just mentioned, and that the projects should be treated as closed systems during 
implementation (i.e., construction and delivery). This thesis warns against too closed 
project orientations.
Indeed, the danger is that the open and participatory stakeholder approach in plan-
ning a project is disconnected from the closed and non-participatory approaches in 
implementation. In the period between planning and implementation (procurement and 
project design), the project can become a black box for local stakeholders because they 
are often not allowed (by law) to participate in procurement processes. The significant 
risk is that stakeholder support/understanding for the project dwindles, and that detailed 
decisions are made in procurement and design that stakeholders oppose to in project 
implementation (see, e.g., Hertogh, Baker, Staal-Ong, & Westerveld, 2008). It is, there-
fore, important to minimize the gap between planning and implementation processes. 
One possibility is to interweave public planning, consultation, and procurement processes 
(see, e.g., Lenferink, Arts, Tillema, Van Valkenburg, & Nijsten, 2012; Van Valkenburg & 
Nagelkerke, 2006; Chapter 4). The management of stakeholder interactions and events in 
implementation, however, remains of unabated, pivotal importance for satisfactory out-
comes in transportation infrastructure project implementation (Chinyio & Olomolaiye, 
2010; Hertogh et al., 2008). Solutions for this, pointed out in thesis, are externally-oriented 
management and/or public-private cooperation (see Section 8.3).

Connecting implementation to planning
Implementing transportation infrastructure projects is an inherently complex and uncer-
tain endeavor. This thesis builds on this notion to stress that it is important for people

involved in project management, public-private partnerships, and project evaluation to 
learn to cope with complexity. As an insurmountable consequence of the complexity-
informed research, boundaries were drawn to restrict the scope of this study. This reduced 
the complexity of this research and made it manageable. For instance, the research focused 
on current road transportation infrastructure projects in the Netherlands. Therefore, this 
thesis does not claim that its conclusions necessarily apply to other projects (e.g., water 
infrastructure or utilities), in the past or in the future, in other countries. Perhaps the 
most significant boundary, however, was the choice to focus on the implementation phase 
of infrastructure projects. This drawn boundary neglected the important fact that much 
has already happened in projects before the shovel hits the ground, inter alia, planning 
and procurement. As projects emerge through time, the pre-conditions for successful 
implementation are born (long) before shoveling starts (path dependency). These pre-
implementation paths are blind spots in this study, as, vice versa, project implementation 
is in studies in spatial planning. By connecting the results of this study to other – both 
existing and future – studies and practices of PPP infrastructure development at large, 
we (might hope to have) learn(t) a bit more about how we can continue to improve the 
development of PPP infrastructure projects.

Aanleiding, doelstelling en relevantie van het 
onderzoek
Dit proefschrift gaat over het managen van complexe implementatieprocessen van publiek-
private samenwerking (PPS) infrastructuurprojecten en het evalueren hiervan met de 
methode ‘systematische kwalitatieve vergelijkende analyse’, ofwel qualitative comparative 
analysis (QCA).
Tegen de achtergrond van de vaak tegenvallende prestaties van infrastructuurontwik-
keling, zoals kostenoverschrijdingen, tijdsoverschrijdingen en sociale onvrede en onenig-
heid, hanteren de praktijk en literatuur op het gebied van (PPS-)infrastructuurontwik-
keling vaak een risicoperspectief. Dit perspectief gaat uit van een realiteit die kenbaar 
en calculeerbaar is. Risico’s worden geïdentificeerd, gecalculeerd en neergelegd bij die 
publieke of private partner die het beste in staat is het risico te managen. Evaluaties van 
projecten wijzen dan vaak in de richting van ineffectieve of strategische risico-identificatie, 
-calculatie en -management als oorzaken van tegenvallende prestaties. Echter, de realiteit 
van de implementatie van infrastructuurprojecten is niet perfect kenbaar en calculeerbaar. 
Zij is fundamenteel complex.
Er gaat in de praktijk en literatuur veel aandacht uit naar het plannen van projecten. 
Maar hoe zorgvuldig ze ook gepland zijn, tijdens de implementatie van projecten – ‘zo-
dra de schop de grond ingaat’  –  treden er gebeurtenissen op die vaak onvoorzien en 
ongepland waren. Als deze complexiteit wordt herkend en erkend, dan richt de aandacht 
bij projectevaluaties zich op de vraag wat kan worden geleerd van eerdere ervaringen 
met het management van de gebeurtenissen, teneinde toekomstige gebeurtenissen en 
projecten effectiever te managen. Hieraan contribueren is de eerste doelstelling van het 
onderzoek. De fundamentele complexiteit van infrastructuurontwikkeling stelt ook eisen 
aan de te gebruiken evaluatiemethode. De methode moet de complexiteit erkennen; zij 
moet complexiteit-geïnformeerd zijn. Evaluatiemethoden die dat niet zijn vormen een 
onrealistisch begrip van implementatieprocessen met het gevolg dat lessen uit evaluaties 
weinig zeggen over wat wel en niet werkt, in welke context en waarom. Dit bemoeilijkt 
leren van evaluaties. Het identificeren van de eisen waaraan de complexiteit-geïnformeerde 

190
Summary in Dutch
evaluatiemethode moet voldoen, en het bepalen van de mate waarin QCA aan deze eisen 
voldoet, is de tweede doelstelling van het onderzoek.
De doelstellingen zijn vervat in de volgende centrale onderzoeksvraag: hoe kan de 
implementatie en het management van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten worden begrepen en 
geëvalueerd vanuit een complexiteitsperspectief met QCA, en welke managementstrategieën in 
projectimplementatie leveren (on)bevredigende uitkomsten op en hoe kan dat worden verklaard?
Met het onderzoeken van deze vraag wordt beoogd bij te dragen aan verschillende 
literaturen. Dit wordt hieronder kort besproken.
1.1.	
Complexiteit en QCA
Uit de complexiteitsliteratuur wordt duidelijk dat complexe systemen, zoals implemen-
tatieprocessen van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten, emergeren uit de interactie tussen een 
veelheid aan elementen binnen het systeem en met de context van het systeem. Een nood-
zakelijke voorwaarde voor het begrijpen van complexe systemen is dus dat de details en 
context ervan worden bestudeerd. Casusstudies zijn hiervoor een geschikte methode. De 
complexiteitsliteratuur maakt ook duidelijk, omdat systemen met elkaar interacteren in een 
deels gedeelde context, dat er gelijkenissen of patronen tussen systemen kunnen worden 
ontdekt. Deze patronen zijn belangrijk om lessen uit casusstudies relevant te maken voor 
andere casus. Echter, casusstudies kunnen moeilijk worden gebruikt om generaliseerbare 
patronen te ontdekken. Dit proefschrift voegt QCA toe aan de complexiteitsliteratuur als 
een geschikte methode om de bestudering van details en context te combineren met de 
noodzaak van patroonontdekking.
1.2.	
Evaluatie en QCA
QCA is een methode in opmars. Literatuurreviews laten zien dat het aantal QCA-toepas-
singen, waaronder in de bestuurskundige literatuur, de laatste jaren sterk is toegenomen. 
Ook in de evaluatieliteratuur wordt steeds meer over QCA geschreven. Daar wordt het 
onder andere geconceptualiseerd als een geschikte methode voor theorie-gestuurde, 
realistische evaluatie. In dit proefschrift wordt QCA geconceptualiseerd als complexiteit-
geïnformeerd. Het wordt daarmee toegevoegd aan de QCA- en evaluatieliteratuur als 
een meer grounded methode. Als zodanig herkent en erkent QCA de complexiteit van 
projectimplementatie en daarin de heterogeniteit van de betrokken publieke en private 
partners en projectstakeholders. Dit maakt QCA als complexiteit-geïnformeerde methode 
geschikt voor leren van evalueren. De empirische studies in dit proefschrift introduceren 
QCA tevens in het veld van, en de literatuur over, (PPS-)infrastructuurprojecten.
1.3.	
Projectmanagement en infrastructuurprojecten
De literatuur over het management van infrastructuurprojecten wordt gedomineerd door 
benaderingen die projectmanagement opvatten als een rationeel proces. Projecten zijn 

191
Summary in Dutch
dan gesloten systemen die volgens vooraf opgestelde protocollen en planningen worden 
uitgevoerd. Dit is echter geen realistische opvatting van projectmanagement. Projecten 
worden niet geïmplementeerd in isolatie; ze interacteren met de sociaal-fysieke context 
waarin ze worden uitgevoerd. Projecten zijn open systemen. Hoewel de fundamentele 
complexiteit van projectimplementatie in toenemende mate wordt herkend en erkend, 
wordt hieraan nog onvoldoende gevolg gegeven in het begrijpen en bestuderen van projec-
timplementatie. Dit proefschrift geeft gehoor aan de roep in de projectmanagementlitera-
tuur om meer situationele, contextuele benaderingen van projectmanagementonderzoek. 
Dit wordt gedaan door projectimplementatie en -management te conceptualiseren vanuit 
een complexiteitsperspectief en dit toe te passen in empirische studies.
1.4.	
Publiek-private samenwerking en infrastructuurprojecten
Publiek-private samenwerking is geen nieuw fenomeen. Wel geniet het de laatste decennia 
toenemende populariteit bij overheden als middel om de prestaties van infrastructuuront-
wikkeling te verbeteren. In de praktijk en literatuur gaat vooral veel aandacht uit naar de 
planning – de ruimtelijke en publieke planning en aanbesteding – van PPS-projecten. De 
implementatie – de bouw en oplevering – die volgt op de fase van planning krijgt minder 
aandacht. Dit is onterecht, want als het implementatieproces ineffectief wordt gemanaged 
dan kunnen geanticipeerde of verkregen voordelen in de planning verloren gaan in imple-
mentatie. Dit proefschrift beantwoord aan de vraag in de PPS-literatuur naar meer onder-
zoek naar het management van implementatieprocessen van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten. 
Daarnaast levert het een bijdrage aan de vooralsnog grotendeels ontbrekende kennis over 
de werking en uitkomsten van DBFM contracten in Nederland – een specifieke vorm van 
PPS – door een empirische studie van een DBFM project.
In de volgende paragraaf wordt aangegeven hoe de centrale onderzoeksvraag is onderzocht 
en hoe het proefschrift is opgebouwd. Daarna worden de conclusies gepresenteerd.
2.	
Structuur van het proefschrift
Het proefschrift bestaat naast een inleidend en concluderend hoofdstuk uit een zestal 
artikelen. Deze artikelen vormen de bouwstenen voor het beantwoorden van de onder-
zoeksvraag (zie Paragraaf 1.3 en Tabel 1.1 in Hoofdstuk 1).
De eerste twee artikelen (Hoofdstukken 2 en 3) leggen de basis voor de empirische 
studies. Ze gaan in op het eerste deel van de onderzoeksvraag. Op basis van complexiteitsli-
teratuur wordt een perspectief uiteengezet over hoe de realiteit te begrijpen is. Dit per-
spectief wordt daarna toegespitst op infrastructuurontwikkeling, en vervolgens specifieker 
op implementatieprocessen in PPS-infrastructuurprojecten. Het complexiteitsperspectief 
resulteert in een aantal methodologische vereisten voor evaluatie. De methode qualitative 
comparative analysis wordt vervolgens getoetst aan deze vereisten.

192
Summary in Dutch
De andere vier artikelen zijn empirisch. In de eerste twee (Hoofdstukken 4 en 5) 
worden afzonderlijk de implementatieprocessen van twee Nederlandse transportinfra-
structuurprojecten geanalyseerd: de A2 Maastricht en de A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein. 
Op basis van kwalitatieve, open interviews worden reeksen onvoorziene gebeurtenissen 
geïdentificeerd. Deze gebeurtenissen zijn fysiek of sociaal van aard. Voor elke gebeurtenis 
wordt bepaald: (1) hoe die werd gemanaged (een project-interne of een project-externe ori-
ëntatie), (2) hoe hierin tussen publieke en private managers werd samengewerkt (coöpera-
tie of non-coöperatie), en (3) met wat voor uitkomsten (tevredenheid of ontevredenheid). 
De gebeurtenissen worden vervolgens geanalyseerd met QCA. Dit resulteert per project in 
managementpatronen die geassocieerd zijn met tevreden of ontevreden uitkomsten in de 
implementatieprocessen van de PPS-projecten.
Daarna wordt in Hoofdstuk 6 een vergelijking gemaakt tussen de patronen van de A2 
Maastricht en de A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein projecten. De twee projecten worden onder 
andere gekenmerkt door verschillende managementoriëntaties, publiek-private samen-
werkingen en uitkomsten. De projectvergelijking biedt verklaringen voor deze verschil-
len. In Hoofdstuk 7 worden vervolgens de implementatieprocessen van zevenentwintig 
transportinfrastructuurprojecten geanalyseerd met QCA. Hiervoor zijn kwalitatieve en 
kwantitatieve data gebruikt uit de projectendatabase van Rijkswaterstaat, welke waren 
verzameld door gastonderzoeker bij Rijkswaterstaat te zijn. Door deze medium-n ver-
gelijkende casusanalyse worden de patronen en verklaringen uit de twee projectstudies 
gecorroboreerd en verder gegeneraliseerd.

Resultaten en conclusies
In deze paragraaf wordt een samenvatting gegeven van de resultaten en conclusies van 
het onderzoek. Allereerst wordt aangegeven wat de vier bouwstenen van de complexiteit 
van projectimplementatie zijn, waarna QCA wordt getoetst aan deze bouwstenen om 
te kunnen concluderen hoe, en in welke mate, QCA een complexiteit-geïnformeerde 
evaluatiemethode is. Dit betreft het eerste deel van de centrale onderzoeksvraag. Daarna 
worden de empirische resultaten samengevat om conclusies te trekken ten aanzien van 
het management en de publiek-private samenwerking in de implementatieprocessen van 
PPS-infrastructuurprojecten.
3.1.	
De vier bouwstenen voor complexiteit-geïnformeerde evaluatie
Leren van evaluaties vereist dat de evaluatiemethode complexiteit-geïnformeerd is. Deze 
complexiteit verwijst niet enkel naar het feit dat implementatieprocessen erg ingewik-
keld zijn. De realiteit is fundamenteel complex. Zij bestaat uit geneste systemen die 
met elkaar verweven zijn. Dit impliceert dat de implementatie en het management van 
PPS-infrastructuurprojecten kunnen worden begrepen aan de hand van vier bouwstenen 

193
Summary in Dutch
van complexiteit: niet-desintegreerbaarheid, contingentie, niet-compressibiliteit en tijd-
asymmetrie (zie Paragraaf 8.2 in Hoofdstuk 8).
Niet-desintegreerbaarheid, ofwel non-decomposability, betekent dat de implementatie 
en het management van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten niet kunnen worden begrepen door 
het afzonderlijk bestuderen van de individuele elementen. Immers, implementatieproces-
sen emergeren uit de interactie tussen de projectelementen (o.a. managementstrategieën 
en PPS-contracten) en met de context van het systeem (o.a. stakeholders en de fysieke 
omgeving). Evaluatiemethoden die gericht zijn op het isoleren van het effect van singuliere 
variabelen op een uitkomst creëren daarom geen realistisch begrip van de implementatie-
processen.
De tweede bouwsteen is contingentie, ofwel contingency. Dit betekent, doordat pro-
jecten interacteren met sociaal-fysieke contexten die veranderlijk en verschillend zijn voor 
projecten, dat implementatieprocessen uniek zijn. Tegelijkertijd kunnen er gelijkenissen 
of patronen worden ontdekt, omdat projecten zich bevinden in een deels stabiele en ge-
deelde context. Gelijkenissen kunnen worden gemanaged met bekende strategieën terwijl 
uniekheden vragen om een situationele aanpak. Voor evaluatie betekent contingentie dat 
methoden die trachten universele wetmatigheden vast te stellen, geen realistisch begrip 
creëren van implementatieprocessen.
Niet-compressibiliteit, ofwel non-compressibility, verwijst naar het feit dat de realiteit 
fundamenteel niet te versimpelen is: implementatieprocessen en uitkomsten emergeren 
uit de interactie tussen systemen in systemen in systemen (genestheid). Echter, om de 
complexe realiteit te bevatten, simplificeren publieke en private managers hun projectwer-
kelijkheid. Zij hanteren verschillende simplificaties doordat zij zich bevinden in verschil-
lende systemen, op basis waarvan zij handelen. Evaluatiemethoden die dit heterogene en 
grounded karakter van de implementatie en het management van PPS-infrastructuurpro-
jecten negeren, creëren er geen realistisch begrip van.
De laatste bouwsteen is tijd-asymmetrie, ofwel time-asymmetry. Dit betekent dat het 
verloop van infrastructuurprojecten uni-directioneel en onomkeerbaar is; causaliteit wordt 
gekenmerkt door emergentie en is non-lineair. Uitkomsten in/van implementatieproces-
sen kunnen achteraf het logische gevolg zijn van sequenties van gebeurtenissen, maar die 
sequenties waren niet kenbaar a priori, toen projecten werden gepland. Implementatiepro-
cessen hebben te kampen met onzekerheden en onvoorziene en ongeplande gebeurtenissen. 
Die gebeurtenissen worden gemanaged. Evaluatiemethoden die dit belang van tijd nege-
ren, creëren geen realistisch begrip van de implementatie van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten 
en dreigen te focussen op ineffectieve of strategische risico-identificatie en -calculatie in 
plaats van leren.
3.2.	
QCA als complexiteit-geïnformeerde evaluatiemethode
De vier bouwstenen van complexiteit stellen eisen aan de evaluatiemethode. Deze eisen 
zijn de volgende (zie Paragraaf 8.4 in Hoofdstuk 8):

194
Summary in Dutch
1.	 Niet-desintegreerbaarheid: de methode moet kunnen evalueren hoe combinaties 
van elementen uitkomsten verklaren.
2.	 Contingentie: (a) de methode moet kunnen evalueren hoe zowel de uniekheden als 
de gelijkenissen of patronen tussen casus bijdragen aan het verklaren van uitkom-
sten, en (b) de methode moet voldoen aan de eis van beperkte generaliseerbaarheid.
3.	 Niet-compressibiliteit: de evaluatiemethode moet de heterogeniteit van projectrea-
liteiten herkennen en erkennen.
4.	 Tijd-asymmetrie: de evaluatiemethode moet (a) de tijdsdimensie kunnen vatten in 
het verklaren van uitkomsten, en (b) herkennen dat implementatieprocessen niet 
perfect voorspelbaar zijn.
Op basis van de toetsing van QCA aan deze vereisten is geconcludeerd dat QCA een 
complexiteit-geïnformeerde methode is. Aan de eerste eis wordt voldaan. QCA is confi-
gurationeel: het analyseert hoe combinaties van elementen een uitkomst verklaren. QCA 
voldoet ook aan de tweede eis. De systematische kwalitatieve vergelijkende analyse wordt 
gekenmerkt door iteraties tussen het identificeren van casus-uniekheden en patronen tus-
sen casus. QCA slaat daarmee een brug tussen een focus op details en context aan de ene 
kant en patroonontdekking aan de andere kant. De patronen die worden gevonden met 
QCA hebben een beperkte generaliseerbaarheid. Dit betekent dat ook aan de derde eis 
wordt voldaan. QCA is een casus-gebaseerde onderzoeksmethode. Aan de start van het 
onderzoeksproces wordt de complexiteit zo min mogelijk versimpeld door een grounded 
benadering te hanteren. Dit laat de heterogeniteit van projectrealiteiten toe in de evalu-
atie. Aan de vierde eis wordt deels voldaan. QCA is in essentie een vergelijkende, statische 
methode die slecht in staat is tijd, temporaliteit of dynamiek een plek in de analyse te 
geven. QCA herkent wel de onvoorspelbaarheid van implementatieprocessen: in QCA 
wordt expliciet herkend en erkend dat patronen contradictoire uitkomsten kunnen heb-
ben, dat relaties niet lineair zijn en dat generalisatie beperkt is.
De implementatie en het management van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten kunnen op 
verschillende manieren worden geëvalueerd met QCA. In het proefschrift worden drie 
dimensies van leren met QCA voorgesteld (zie Figuur 8.2 in Hoofdstuk 8). De eerste 
dimensie is leren tussen projecten of projectimplementaties door deze met elkaar te verge-
lijken (zie bijvoorbeeld Hoofdstuk 7). Op deze manier kunnen lessen uit een succesvolle 
casus worden toegepast op een vergelijkbare maar minder succesvolle casus. De tweede 
dimensie is leren binnen een project of projectimplementatie. Door gebeurtenissen of 
situaties binnen een project met elkaar te vergelijken (zie bijvoorbeeld Hoofdstukken 4, 
5 en 6) kunnen managers binnen een project leren wat voor soort gebeurtenissen om wat 
voor managementstrategie en publiek-private samenwerking vragen. De derde dimensie 
betreft het leren over de perspectieven van actoren binnen een project. Elke deelnemer aan 
de evaluatie is dan een casus. Door deze met elkaar te vergelijken wordt duidelijk waar per-
spectieven tussen actoren verschillen en waar ze overeenkomen. Dit biedt mogelijkheden 
voor het vinden van wederzijds begrip en consensus.

195
Summary in Dutch
In het proefschrift wordt voorgedragen dat QCA ook kan worden toegepast als een 
collaboratieve en interactieve evaluatietool. Voor elk van de drie dimensies biedt QCA een 
vier-stap structuur waarin de deelnemers op collaboratieve en interactieve wijze het evalu-
atieproces kunnen doorlopen (zie Figuur 8.3 in Hoofdstuk 8). Hierbij is het belangrijk dat 
de heterogeniteit van actoren is geborgd door zowel publieke als private actoren deel te la-
ten nemen aan het proces. Op deze manier wordt de kennisbasis van de evaluatie vergroot, 
intensiveert de publiek-private samenwerking en worden geleerde lessen gemakkelijker 
teruggekoppeld naar de praktijk van de implementatie van PPS-infrastructuurprojecten.
3.3.	
Management en publiek-private samenwerking in projectimplementatie
Tijdens de projectimplementatie treden er in de projectcontext onvoorziene gebeurte-
nissen op van uiteenlopende aard. Deze gebeurtenissen zijn sociaal of fysiek van aard. 
Gebeurtenissen met een sociale aard betreffen stakeholders in de context van het project 
die reageren op de projectuitvoering. Fysieke gebeurtenissen hebben hun oorsprong in het 
fysieke systeem waarin wordt geïmplementeerd. Deze gebeurtenissen worden gemanaged. 
De managementstrategie die wordt gekozen is intern- of extern-georiënteerd. Het verschil 
is dat de tweede zich kenmerkt door een oriëntatie op de sociale projectomgeving: oplos-
singen voor gebeurtenissen worden gezocht in interactie met stakeholders. Dat is bij de 
intern-georiënteerde strategie niet het geval. Daarnaast kiezen publieke en private mana-
gers ervoor om samen op te treden in het management van de gebeurtenis (coöperatie) 
of juist de publiek-private grenzen te benadrukken en verantwoordelijkheden en taken 
te scheiden (non-coöperatie). De uitkomst van het management van gebeurtenissen is 
vanwege de heterogeniteit van publieke en private managers – zij hebben verschillende 
achtergronden, taken en verantwoordelijkheden  –  niet eendimensionaal te definiëren. 
De uitkomstmaat ‘tevredenheid’ (‘satisfactie’) is in het proefschrift gebruikt. Het is een 
multidimensionaal concept dat meerdere uitkomsten vat, zoals: kostenoverschrijdingen, 
tijdsoverschrijdingen, sociale onvrede en onenigheid en de publiek-private samenwer-
kingsrelatie.
De QCA-evaluaties wijzen uit dat er verschillende managementstrategieën zijn in 
PPS-projectimplementatie die (on)bevredigende uitkomsten opleveren (zie Paragraaf 8.4 
in Hoofdstuk 8). Twee resultaten zijn:
1.	 Een intern-georiënteerde managementstrategie voor gebeurtenissen met een sociale 
aard resulteert in onbevredigende uitkomsten.
2.	 Een extern-georiënteerde managementstrategie voor gebeurtenissen met een sociale 
aard resulteert in bevredigende uitkomsten.
Op basis van deze resultaten kan worden geconcludeerd dat een extern-georiënteerde 
managementstrategie te verkiezen is boven een intern-georiënteerde strategie in imple-
mentatieprocessen. Twee andere resultaten zijn de volgende:

196
Summary in Dutch
3.	 Een intern-georiënteerde managementstrategie door de private partner resulteert 
in onbevredigende uitkomsten.
4.	 Een intern-georiënteerde managementstrategie, coöperatief of door de publieke 
partner, resulteert in bevredigende uitkomsten.
Deze resultaten tonen aan dat een intern-georiënteerde managementstrategie ook bevredi-
gende uitkomsten kan opleveren, indien de publieke en private partners hierin samenwer-
ken. Het kan geconcludeerd worden dat een coöperatieve strategie valt te verkiezen boven 
een non-coöperatieve strategie. Maar coöperatie is niet noodzakelijk in het geval van een 
extern-georiënteerde managementstrategie. De resultaten laten dus zien dat de effectiviteit 
van intern-georiënteerd management en van non-coöperatie kan worden verhoogd door 
respectievelijk coöperatie en extern-georiënteerd management.
Een verklaring voor een externe managementoriëntatie ligt in de integraliteit van infra-
structuurprojecten. In integrale projecten worden verschillende ruimtelijke functies in de 
uitvoering in samenhang aangepakt, wat betekent dat meerdere stakeholders betrokken 
zijn. Het voordeel van de nauwe betrokkenheid van stakeholders is dat hun belangen 
worden geïnternaliseerd in project. Dit zorgt voor minder weerstand vanuit de stakehol-
deromgeving en de belangen van stakeholders zijn kenbaarder voor het projectmanage-
ment. De uitdaging die samenhangt met de nauwe betrokkenheid van veel stakeholders 
is dat het mogelijk zorgt voor ingewikkeldere (gepercipieerde) uitvoeringsprocessen en 
de noodzaak van intensief en kostbaar stakeholdermanagement. Omgekeerd zorgt het op 
afstand houden van stakeholders voor minder ingewikkelde (gepercipieerde) processen, 
maar mogelijk ook voor meer weerstand uit de omgeving en een mindere kenbaarheid 
van de stakeholderbelangen. Dit kan zorgen voor sociale onvoorziene en ongeplande 
gebeurtenissen in de projectimplementatie, met mogelijk nog hogere kosten als gevolg.
Verklaringen voor een interne managementoriëntatie en non-coöperatie liggen in de 
contractvorm. In concessionele vormen van PPS, zoals DBFM, hangt het succes van het 
project samen met het halen van scherpe tijdsplanningen. Deze tijdsdruk creëert een blik 
naar binnen. Kenmerkender nog is dat concessionele PPS een contractuele focus kent en 
een scherpe scheiding van publieke en private systemen. In DBFM zijn de verantwoor-
delijkheden voor de projectimplementatie in handen van de private partner; de publieke 
opdrachtgever legt zich toe op het monitoren van de opdrachtnemer. Het voordeel van 
deze scherpe scheiding is transparantie in de samenwerking. De zwakte is dat samenwer-
king over de publiek-private grenzen heen bemoeilijkt wordt. Deze samenwerking is wel 
belangrijk, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van stakeholdermanagement. Publieke opdrachtge-
vers beschikken vaak over sterkere en langdurigere relaties met, en betere toegang tot, de 
stakeholders in de projectomgeving. In DBFM is het gevaar dat deze relaties niet worden 
aangewend door de publieke partner vanwege de scheiding van de verantwoordelijkheden, 
terwijl het juist kan bijdragen aan een effectievere projectimplementatie. Alliantie-achtige 
vormen van PPS kenmerken zich daarentegen door coöperatie over de publiek-private 
grenzen heen, maar daar kan het bewaken van transparantie in de samenwerking de 

197

Motivation, research aim, and relevance of the 
research
This thesis is about managing complex implementation processes of public-private part-
nership (PPP) infrastructure projects and the evaluation thereof with the method qualita-
tive comparative analysis (QCA).
Against the background of the often disappointing performances of infrastructure 
development, such as cost overruns, time overruns, and social discontent, the practice and 
literature in the field of (PPP) infrastructure development often apply a risk-perspective. 
This perspective assumes a reality that is knowable and calculable. Risks are identified, 
calculated, and allocated to the public or private partner best able to manage the risk. 
Following this perspective, evaluations of infrastructure projects often point to ineffective 
or strategic risk identification, risk calculation, or risk management as causes of the disap-
pointing performances. However, the reality of infrastructure project implementation is 
not perfectly knowable and calculable. It is fundamentally complex.
A lot of attention is devoted in practice and in the literature to the planning of 
projects. However, no matter how carefully they are planned, when projects are imple-
mented – ‘once the shovel hits the ground’ – events occur that were often unforeseen 
and unplanned. If this complexity is recognized and acknowledged, then the attention in 
project evaluation can be focused on what can be learned from previous experiences with 
managing such events, so as to manage future ones more effectively. Contributing to this 
is the first aim of this research. The fundamental complexity of infrastructure develop-
ment also imposes requirements on the evaluation method to be used. The method needs 
to acknowledge the complexity; it should be complexity-informed. Evaluation methods 
that are not create an unrealistic understanding of implementation processes with the 
consequence that evaluations tell us little about what works and what does not, in which 
contexts, and why. This hampers learning from evaluations. Identifying the requirements 
for a complexity-informed evaluation method, and assessing the extent to which QCA 
meets these requirements, is the second aim of the research.
Following these aims, the central research question is: how can the implementation and 
management of PPP infrastructure projects be understood and evaluated from a complexity 

200
Summary in English
perspective using QCA, what management responses in project implementation yield (un)
satisfactory outcomes, and how can this be explained?
By investigating this question, the intention is to contribute to different fields of 
literature. These are briefly discussed below.
1.1.	
Complexity and QCA
The complexity literature tells us that complex systems, such as implementation processes 
of PPP infrastructure projects, emerge from the interaction between a multitude of ele-
ments within the system and with the system’s context. Understanding complex systems 
thus requires that their details and context are studied. Case studies are an appropriate 
means for this. The complexity literature also tells us that, because systems interact in a 
partly-shared context, similarities or patterns between systems can be recognized. These 
patterns are important to make lessons from case studies relevant to other cases. However, 
it is hard to uncover generalizable patterns from case studies. This thesis adds QCA to the 
complexity literature as a suitable method to combine the study of details and context 
with the need for pattern recognition.
1.2.	
Evaluation and QCA
QCA is a method on the rise. Literature reviews show that the number of QCA applica-
tions, including in the Public Administration literature, has strongly increased. QCA is 
also increasingly discussed and applied in the evaluation literature where it is, inter alia, 
conceptualized as a suitable method for theory-driven, realistic evaluation. In this thesis, 
QCA is conceptualized as a complexity-informed method. In doing so, it is added to the 
QCA and evaluation literature as a more grounded approach. As such, QCA recognizes 
and acknowledges the complexity of project implementation, and the heterogeneity of 
the public and private partners and project stakeholders involved in implementation. This 
makes QCA, as a complexity-informed method, suitable for learning from evaluations. 
The empirical studies in this doctoral thesis also introduce QCA in the field and literature 
of (PPP) infrastructure projects.
1.3.	
Project management and infrastructure projects
The literature about the management of infrastructure projects is dominated by ap-
proaches that understand project management as a rational process. In those approaches, 
projects are closed systems that are implemented according to predefined protocols and 
planning schedules. This is, however, not a realistic understanding of project management. 
Projects are not implemented in isolation; they interact with the socio-physical context 
in which they are constructed. Projects are open systems. Although the fundamental 
complexity of project implementation is increasingly recognized and acknowledged, this 
is yet insufficiently acted on in understanding and studying project implementation. 

201
Summary in English
This thesis answers to the call in the project management literature for more situational, 
contextual approaches in project management research. This is done by conceptualizing 
project implementation and management from a complexity perspective, and applying 
this in empirical studies.
1.4.	
Public-private partnerships and infrastructure projects
Public-private partnerships are not a new phenomenon, but they are increasingly popular 
with governments as means to improve the performance of infrastructure development. A 
lot of attention is devoted in practice and in the literature to the planning – the spatial and 
public planning and the procurement – of PPP projects. The implementation – construc-
tion and delivery – that follows the planning phase receives less attention. This is unfortu-
nate: if the implementation process is ineffectively managed, anticipated or obtained gains 
in the planning might be lost in implementation. This doctoral thesis answers to the call 
in the PPP literature for more research into the management of implementation processes 
of PPP infrastructure projects. Additionally, by means of an empirical study of a DBFM 
project, it contributes to the yet little available knowledge about the functioning and 
results of DBFM contracts – a specific type of PPP – in the Netherlands.
The next section explains how the central research question was studied and how this 
thesis is structured. Thereafter, the conclusions are presented.
2.	
Structure of the thesis
Besides the introductory and concluding chapters, this doctoral thesis consists of six 
articles. These articles provide the building blocks to answering the research question (see 
Section 1.3 and Table 1.1 in Chapter 1).
The first two articles (Chapters 2 and 3) form the basis for the empirical studies. 
They address the first part of the research question. Based on complexity literature, a 
perspective is outlined as to how reality is understood. This perspective is then focused 
on infrastructure development, and the implementation processes in PPP infrastructure 
projects specifically. The complexity perspective results in methodological prerequisites for 
evaluation, after which it is assessed to which extent the method qualitative comparative 
analysis meets these requisites.
The other four articles are empirical. In the first two (Chapters 4 and 5), the imple-
mentation processes of two Dutch transportation infrastructure projects are separately 
analyzed: the A2 Maastricht and the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein. Based on qualitative open 
interviews, a number of unforeseen events is identified. These events have a physical or 
social nature. For each event it is assessed: (1) how it was managed (a project-internal 
or project-external orientation), (2) how public and private managers cooperated herein 
(cooperation or non-cooperation), and (3) with what outcomes (satisfaction or dissatisfac-

202
Summary in English
tion). Next, the events were analyzed with QCA. This resulted in management patterns 
associated with either satisfaction or dissatisfaction in the implementation processes of 
PPP projects.
Thereafter, the patterns in the A2 Maastricht and A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein projects 
are compared in Chapter 6. The two projects are characterized by, inter alia, different man-
agement orientations, public-private cooperation, and outcomes. The project comparison 
offers explanations for the differences. In Chapter 7, the implementation processes of 
twenty-seven transportation infrastructure projects are analyzed with QCA. Qualitative 
and quantitative data were used from the Rijkswaterstaat project database, which were 
collected by being a visiting researcher at Rijkswaterstaat. By means of this medium-n 
comparative case analysis, the patterns and explanations from the two project studies are 
corroborated and further generalized.
3.	
Results and conclusions
In this section, the results and conclusions of the research are summarized. First it is speci-
fied what the four building blocks are of the complexity of project implementation, after 
which QCA is assessed against these building blocks, so as to be able to conclude how, and 
to what extent, QCA is a complexity-informed evaluation method. This concerns the first 
part of the research question. Thereafter, the results of the empirical studies are summa-
rized to draw conclusions with respect to the management and public-private cooperation 
in the implementation processes of PPP infrastructure projects.
3.1.	
The four building blocks for complexity-informed evaluation
Learning from evaluations requires that the evaluation method is complexity-informed. 
This complexity does not just refer to the fact that implementation processes are very 
difficult. Reality is fundamentally complex. It consists of nested, interrelated systems. 
This implies that the implementation and management of PPP infrastructure projects can 
be understood on the basis of four building blocks of complexity: non-decomposability, 
contingency, non-compressibility, and time-asymmetry (see Section 8.2 in Chapter 8).
Non-decomposability means that the implementation and management of PPP 
infrastructure projects cannot be understood by separately studying the individual ele-
ments. Indeed, implementation processes emerge from the interaction between the project 
elements (inter alia, management strategies and PPP contracts) and with the context of the 
system (inter alia, stakeholders and the physical environment). Evaluation methods that 
are focused on isolating the effect of single variables on an outcome do not create a realistic 
understanding of implementation processes.
The second building block is contingency. This means that, because projects interact 
with social-physical contexts that are dynamic and particular for projects, implementation 
processes are unique. At the same time, similarities or patterns can be recognized because 

203
Summary in English
projects are embedded in contexts that are partly stable and shared. Whilst similarities 
can be managed with known strategies, the unique aspects of projects require a situational 
approach. The implication for evaluation is that methods that try to establish universal 
laws do not create a realistic understanding of implementation processes.
Non-compressibility refers to the fact that it is fundamentally not possible to simplify 
reality: implementation processes and outcomes emerge from the interaction between 
systems in systems in systems (nestedness). However, to be able to comprehend the com-
plex reality, public and private managers simplify their project reality. They have different 
simplifications, because they are nested in different systems, on the basis of which they act. 
Evaluation methods that ignore this heterogeneous and grounded nature of implementing 
and managing PPP infrastructure projects do not create a realistic understanding of it.
The final building block is time-asymmetry. This means that the development of infra-
structure projects is unidirectional and irreversible; causality is characterized by emergence 
and non-linearity. Outcomes in/of implementation processes can be the logical results of 
sequences of events in hindsight, but those sequences were unknowable a priori, when 
projects were planned. Implementation processes have to contend with uncertainties and 
unforeseen and unplanned events. These events are managed. Evaluation methods that 
ignore this importance of time do not create a realistic understanding of the implementa-
tion of PPP infrastructure projects, and they impend to focus on ineffective or strategic 
risk identification and calculation instead of learning.
3.2.	
QCA as a complexity-informed evaluation method
The four building blocks of complexity impose requirements on the evaluation method. 
These are the following (see Section 8.4 in Chapter 8).
1.	 Non-decomposability: the method has to be able to evaluate how combinations of 
elements explain outcomes.
2.	 Contingency: (a) the method has to be able to evaluate how both peculiarities and 
similarities or patterns between cases contribute to explaining outcomes, and (b) 
the method has to be capable of limited generalization.
3.	 Non-compressibility: the evaluation method has to recognize and acknowledge the 
heterogeneity of project realities.
4.	 Time-asymmetry: the evaluation method should be able (a) to include the time 
dimension in explaining outcomes, and (b) to recognize that implementation 
processes are not perfectly predictable.
Based on the assessment of QCA against these requisites, it is concluded that QCA is a 
complexity-informed method. The first requirement is met. QCA is configurational: it 
analyzes how combinations of elements explain an outcome. QCA also meets the second 
requirement. The systematic qualitative comparative analysis is characterized by iterations 
between identifying case peculiarities and patterns between cases. In this way, QCA strikes 

204
Summary in English
a balance between a focus on details and context on the one hand and pattern recognition 
on the other. The patterns that are found with QCA have a limited generalizability. This 
means that the third requirement is also met. QCA is a case-based research method. At the 
start of the research process, the complexity is minimally simplified by applying a grounded 
approach. This gives the heterogeneity of project realities a place in the evaluation. The 
fourth requirement is partly met. In essence, QCA is a comparative, static method that is 
not well capable of including time, temporality, or dynamics in the analysis. QCA does 
recognize the unpredictability of implementation processes: in QCA, it is explicitly recog-
nized and acknowledged that patterns can have contradictory outcomes, that relationships 
are non-linear, and that generalization is limited.
The implementation and the management of PPP infrastructure projects can be evaluated 
with QCA in different ways. In this doctoral thesis, three dimensions of learning are 
proposed (see Figure 8.2 in Chapter 8). The first dimension is learning between projects 
or project implementations (see, e.g., Chapter 7). In this way, lessons from successful 
cases can be applied to similar but less successful cases. The second dimension is learning 
within a project or implementation. By comparing events or situations within a project 
with each other (see, e.g., Chapters 4, 5, and 6), managers within a project can learn what 
kind of events require what kind of management strategy and public-private cooperation. 
The third dimension concerns learning about actor’s perspectives within a project. Each 
participant in the evaluation is a case, and by comparing these with each other it becomes 
clear where perspectives between actors differentiate and where they are similar. This offers 
opportunities for finding mutual understanding and consensus.
In this thesis, it is proposed that QCA can also be applied as a collaborative and 
interactive evaluation tool. For each of the three dimensions, QCA offers a four-step 
structure within which the evaluation participants can go through the evaluation process 
in a collaborative and interactive manner (see Figure 8.3 in Chapter 8). It is important 
here that the heterogeneity of actors is safeguarded by letting both public and private 
actors participate in the process. In this way, the knowledge base of the evaluation is 
strengthened, the public-private cooperation intensifies, and learnt lessons are easier fed 
back into the practice of implementing PPP infrastructure projects.
3.3.	
Management and public-private cooperation in project implementation
During project implementation, different unforeseen events occur in the project context. 
These events are of a social or physical nature. Social events concern stakeholders in the 
context of the project that react to the project implementation. Physical events originate 
from the physical system in which the project is implemented. These events are managed. 
The management strategy that is chosen is internally-oriented or externally-oriented. The 
difference is that the latter is characterized by an orientation on the social project environ-
ment: solutions for events are sought in interaction with stakeholders. This is not the case 
with the internally-oriented strategy. Furthermore, public and private managers choose to 

205
Summary in English
work together in the management of an event (cooperation) or to stress the public-private 
boundaries and to separate responsibilities and tasks (non-cooperation). Because of the 
heterogeneity of public and private managers – they have different backgrounds, tasks, 
and responsibilities – the outcome of the management of events is not one-dimensionally 
definable. The outcome measure of ‘satisfaction’ is used in this thesis. It is a multidimen-
sional concept that comprises multiple outcomes, such as: cost overruns, time overruns, 
social discontent, and the public-private relationship.
The QCA evaluations showed that different management strategies in PPP project 
implementation produce (un)satisfactory outcomes (see Section 8.4 in Chapter 8). Two 
results are:
1.	 An internally-oriented management strategy for social events results in unsatisfac-
tory outcomes.
2.	 An externally-oriented management strategy for social events results in satisfactory 
outcomes.
On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that an externally-oriented management 
strategy is preferable over an internally-oriented management strategy in implementation 
processes. Two other results are the following:
3.	 An internally-oriented management strategy by the private partner results in unsat-
isfactory outcomes.
4.	 An internally-oriented management strategy, cooperatively or by the public part-
ner, results in satisfactory outcomes.
These results show that, if the public and private partners cooperate, an internally-oriented 
strategy can also yield satisfactory outcomes. It can be concluded that a cooperative strat-
egy is preferable over a non-cooperative strategy. However, cooperation is not necessary 
in the case of an externally-oriented management strategy. The results thus show that the 
effectiveness of internally-oriented management and non-cooperation can be increased by 
cooperation and externally-oriented management, respectively.
An explanation for the externally-oriented management strategy lies in the integrality 
of infrastructure projects. In integral projects, different spatial functions are combined 
which means that different stakeholders are involved. The advantage of the close involve-
ment of stakeholders is that their interests are internalized in the project. This makes for 
less resistance from the stakeholder environment, and the stakeholder’s interests are more 
knowable to the project’s management. The challenge associated with the close involve-
ment of stakeholders is that it might lead to more complicated (perceived) implementa-
tion processes and the need for intensive and costly stakeholder management. Conversely, 
keeping stakeholders more at a distance from the project results in less complicated (per-
ceived) processes, but also the possibility of more resistance from the environment and 

206
Summary in English
less knowledge of stakeholders’ interests. This can lead to social unforeseen and unplanned 
events in project implementation, with possibly even higher costs as a consequence.
Explanations for the internal management orientation and non-cooperation lie 
in the contract type. In concessional types of PPP, such as DBFM, the success of the 
project is linked to meeting a challenging time planning. This time pressure creates an 
inward-orientation. Even more characteristic is that concessional PPPs have a contractual 
focus and a strict separation of public and private systems. In DBFM, the responsibility 
for project implementation lies with the private partner; the public partner focuses on 
monitoring the contractor. The advantage of this strict separation is transparency in the 
public-private relationship. The weakness is that it impedes cooperation across the public-
private boundaries. This cooperation is important, inter alia with respect to stakeholder 
management. Public principals often feature stronger and longer-lasting relationships with 
stakeholders in the project environment. In DBFM, the danger is that these relationships 
are not used by the public partner because of the separation of responsibilities whilst it 
can contribute to a more effective project implementation. Alliance-like types of PPP are 
characterized, in contrast, by cooperation across the public-private boundaries, with the 
possible consequence that maintaining transparency in the cooperation is challenging. The 
optimum possibly lies in the middle, for example by organizing stakeholder management 
in an alliance within a DBFM contract. Further research can shed light on the effective-
ness of this option.

Acknowledgments
No project, including this Ph.D. thesis, is an island. Although this book bears my name on 
the cover, its content has been shaped and made possible by various people. Here, I would 
like to acknowledge the contributions they have made to this thesis.
First and foremost I am indebted to my promotors, Geert Teisman and Lasse Gerrits. In 
my experience, conducting a Ph.D. research makes you an expert of a postage stamp: you learn 
a lot about a bit. Geert has been invaluable in helping me to recognize and appreciate the big-
ger picture of my research, with regards to both Public Administration research and practice. 
Especially during the final stages of the study, Geert showed me how my research addresses 
broader public administration issues, and he guided me in trying to translate this to words on 
paper. Furthermore, I find his ability to convey academic knowledge about complexity and 
public administration to a non-academic audience admirable. It inspired me to interact with 
practitioners about my research, which I have come to greatly value and enjoy.
Although no formal comparative analysis precedes this statement, I believe it’s fair to 
claim that ‘Lasse was a necessary condition for this book’, for multiple reasons. To begin, 
Lasse is the one who encouraged me to enter academia in the first place. Second, the 
genesis of this research lies with Lasse, both in terms of the idea for the research and the 
translation of this idea into the research proposal that we wrote and which got funded. 
Third, and perhaps most important, his mentorship made my Ph.D. project an exciting, 
instructive, and productive experience. His informal and close but relaxed involvement, 
genuine interest in the research, and his knowledge and skills as both a researcher and 
teacher, made this book happen. I also enjoyed our trips to conferences in Las Vegas, Los 
Angeles, Munich, and Phoenix; and our coffee-/tea-meetings in Bamberg, Berlin, Rot-
terdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. These have contributed to my experience of academia in 
a very positive way. Lasse is a great mentor. This dissertation is finished, but I am excited 
that we can continue our work in Bamberg.
For a large part, this study was funded by Next Generation Infrastructures (NGInfra). 
After a bumpy start, Judith Schueler in particular helped us to secure the funds for this 
research. I believe I speak on behalf of both Lasse and myself when I say that we greatly 
appreciate the financial support of NGInfra for this study.
Next, I want to thank all the respondents who agreed to be interviewed for this research. I 
imagine that it can sometimes be hard to open up to a stranger about the experiences involved

in managing large and complex infrastructure projects, especially when things are not always 
running as smoothly as planned. Their experiences and narratives not only provided necessary 
data for this study, but they also made the world of infrastructure project implementation a 
fascinating one to me. The respondents have strengthened my conviction that research is most 
interesting when it interacts, in one way or another, with its objects or subjects of study.
This brings me to Rijkswaterstaat. After digging through old emails, I found that I 
contacted Rijkswaterstaat’s national information line mid-June in 2011 with the request 
to cooperate in my research. This resulted in a first meeting with Freek Wermer, a little 
over two months later. It took us a couple of years, but our series of meetings and Freek’s 
sustained efforts cumulated in the consent of Rijkswaterstaat that I would work with its 
project database as a visiting researcher in 2013 and 2014. Not only did this result in new 
data and in several publications (the contents of which are my responsibility), it also 
introduced me to new and interesting people within the organization, amongst whom 
the participants of the PPP PhD-Network RWS. I want to thank Freek for making all 
this possible. I also thank the staff of the Department of Project Management (PM) of 
the Directorate of Production and Project Management (GPO) for making my stay at 
Rijkswaterstaat a very pleasant one.
Next, I want to express my appreciation to the Department of Public Administration at Eras-
mus University Rotterdam for the pleasant and informative times I was able to enjoy there. It 
provided the fertile soil for my research. I want to thank a couple of people in particular.
I was fortunate enough to work with Jurian Edelenbos, Erik-Hans Klijn, and Joop 
Koppenjan on multiple occasions throughout the years. I learned a lot from them, I have 
always experienced our meetings as pleasant ones, and I strongly feel that our joint endeav-
ors have contributed to my Ph.D. thesis – and my academic development in general – in 
various and positive ways. Luckily, we are able to continue our collaborations.
I also want to thank Frank Boons, Nanny Bressers, Arwin van Buuren, Jasper Eshuis, 
Harry Geerlings, Peter Marks, Rebecca Moody, and Bonno Pel for the enjoyable and 
interesting discussions we had, often, but not limited to, the Governance of Complex 
Systems (GOCS) settings. In particular, I admire Frank Boons for his critical and inquir-
ing scientific attitude. Perhaps without him knowing it, he made and makes me question 
my research on several occasions – which is a good thing.
For a short while, the Department welcomed professors from universities across the 
Atlantic: Jack Meek and Yushim Kim. I am glad that they visited the Netherlands and 
that we have come to know each other even better. They have contributed to a pleasant 
and interesting period in Rotterdam, for which I thank them. I’m excited that we are now 
working together on projects.
I have experienced my time at Erasmus University Rotterdam as a lively one, and 
for the most part this is due to my fellow Ph.D. students at the Department. I especially 
thank Ingmar van Meerkerk, Wouter Spekkink, and Joris van der Voet. We have known 
each other for over ten years now, since we started our Public Administration bachelor 
studies back in 2004. Throughout the years, we often continued our talks over drinks, at

barbecues, or on holidays. I also enjoyed watching ‘good movies because they are actually 
really bad movies’, but I’m still waiting for Ingmar’s homemade pasta… I thank Wouter in 
particular for our close and sincere friendship.
I also want to thank all the other Ph.D. students and junior researchers I have gotten 
to know over the years, and who have contributed to an enjoyable time at the Department. 
In particular, Ewald de Bruijn, Danny Schipper, and Lieselot Vandenbussche were great 
‘blokje’ roommates, Iris Korthagen was the perfect co-chair of the Ph.D. Platform, and 
William Voorberg livened things up on multiple occasions. They and others have been 
very nice colleagues and I have sincerely enjoyed their company. I tend to think this was 
likewise; at some point they became to accept that, most of the times, I was not going to 
join for lunch. But they still kept inviting me – heartwarming!
Doing a Ph.D. research tends to consume quite a lot of your time. In my experience, it 
continues beyond the ‘office hours’, extending mentally into daily life. Various people have 
contributed in different ways to making sure that this thesis reached its conclusion, and 
that the working hours and stress levels involved did not reach unacceptable values.
I would like to thank my friends from high school – Gijs, Kirsten, Pascal, and Rick – for 
providing the necessary distraction from my ‘scriptie’ (or, even worse, ‘profielwerkstuk’) and 
from academic life in general. For the same reasons, I also thank my college friends: Jos, 
Machiel, and Wouter. I am also grateful to Harry and Martika for their interest and support.
I want to mention my brother David and my sister Natasja as well, who I can always 
ask for advice and with whom I always have a great time. I admire them for who they are 
and for what they do, and I feel privileged with such a wonderful family. I also thank them 
for supporting me on the day of my Ph.D. defense and for the design of this book’s cover.
Beyond doubt, the conditio sine qua non is my parents: Annemarie and Cor. Apart 
from the obvious facts of life, I consider their warm love, good care, and the norms and 
values they have conveyed, as having been essential for the conclusion of this doctoral 
thesis. My parents provided the rock solid base for my Ph.D. process, enabling and en-
couraging in various ways my education, both academically and in other facets of my life. 
I regard them amongst the wisest people I know.
Finally, I want to thank Karen. More than any other person, she had to endure my 
moods and emotions up close. I imagine that this often must have been tedious and 
tiresome, but she was indefatigable in putting my mind at rest whenever I felt stressed. I 
might regret these words when we have one of our discussions… but I learned during my 
doctoral research that, most of the times, she’s right and I should follow her advice. Dear 
Karen, the bad ‘news’ is that I’m a stubborn person, so it may take years before I really act 
upon that lesson. The good thing is that I’ll be spending those years with you.
I dedicate this book to Annemarie and Cor.

About the author
About the Author
Stefan Verweij (1985) studied Public Administration at Erasmus University Rotterdam, 
specializing in the governance of complex spatial developments (M.Sc., 2009). During 
his studies (2004-2009), he also served as a board member of the study association of the 
Faculty of Social Sciences. In 2009, he joined the Department of Public Administration 
at Erasmus University Rotterdam (the Netherlands) as a junior lecturer, participating in 
research projects as well.
Stefan started working as a Ph.D. candidate from January 2011, examining the man-
agement of complex implementation processes of public-private partnership projects. He 
specialized in qualitative research methods and qualitative comparative analysis in particu-
lar. He completed the two-year doctorate training program of the Netherlands Institute 
of Government in 2013. Alongside his Ph.D. research, Stefan was also a visiting researcher 
at Rijkswaterstaat (2013-2014) and at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany (2014). He 
furthermore taught courses on governance networks and qualitative comparative analysis, 
and co-supervised master theses. He was also the president of Ph.D. Platform for Public 
Administration at Erasmus University Rotterdam (2013-2014).
Stefan presented his work at several national and international academic conferences, 
and chaired panels at some of these conferences. His work has been published in multiple 
academic journals, including Evaluation, International Journal of Project Management, 
Journal of Critical Realism, Public Administration, Transport Policy, and Public Works 
Management & Policy. He also acts as a reviewer for academic journals. He regularly writes 
about his research in professional magazines as well.
As of March 2015, Stefan works as an assistant professor (Akademischer Rat auf Zeit) 
at the Department of Political Science at the University of Bamberg (Germany), where 
he continues his research on complexity, governance networks, infrastructure projects, 
management, public-private partnerships, spatial planning, and qualitative comparative 
analysis. He also teaches about these topics.

Much attention is being paid to the planning of public-private 
partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. The subsequent 
implementation phase – when the contract has been signed 
and the project ‘starts rolling’ – has received less attention. 
However, sound agreements and good intentions in project 
planning can easily fail in project implementation. Implementing 
PPP infrastructure projects is complex, but what does this 
complexity entail? How are projects managed, and how do 
public and private partners cooperate in implementation? What 
are effective management strategies to achieve satisfactory 
outcomes? This is the ﬁ rst set of questions addressed in 
this thesis. Importantly, the complexity of PPP infrastructure 
development imposes requirements on the evaluation methods that can 
be applied for studying these questions. Evaluation methods that ignore 
complexity do not create a realistic understanding of PPP implementation 
processes, with the consequence that evaluations tell us little about what 
works and what does not, in which contexts, and why. This hampers learning 
from evaluations. What are the requirements for a complexity-informed 
evaluation method? And how does qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) 
meet these requirements? This is the second set of questions addressed in 
this thesis.
