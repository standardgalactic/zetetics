PREFACE 
The 4th Predoctoral Astrophysics School of the European Astrophysics Doctoral Network (EADN) 
was held from August 19 - 31, 1991 at Graz-Marialrost with the participation of 7 teachers, and 34 
students from 11 European countries. With this School EADN has completed half a decade of 
European collaboration in the field of academic teaching in astrophysics. After the EADN Schools at 
Les Houches (France, 1988), Ponte de Lima (Portugal, 1989) and Dublin (Ireland, 1990) Austrian 
astronomy hosted the fourth School and chose Graz as its venue. 
Graz is related to both subjects of the School - Galactic High-Energy Astrophysics, and High 
Accuracy Timing and Positional Astronomy - through historical and contemporary circumstances. It 
is known as one of the Kepler cities. In 1994 Graz will celebrate the 400th anniversary of Kepler's 
arrival there where he started both his teaching and scientific careers. Kepler worked on the most 
accurate and numerous positional observations available at that time through the efforts of Tycho 
Brahe; he can be said to have also contributed to the field of High Energy Astronomy by his book on 
the detection of a STELLA NOVA; which in fact was the last naked-eye supernova discovery (1604) 
before the recent famous supernova SN 1987A. 
We would like to mention here also that the discoverer of cosmic rays - part of the fast topic of the 
Graz School - was the Nobel Prize winner Viktor F. Hess who conducted his research at the 
Karl-Franzens University of Graz. Other wen-known scientists, who at some time in their careers 
worked at this University, include Boltzmann, Schr6dinger (Nobel Prize 1933) and Mach. 
Like the other two classical Austrian universities of Vienna and Innsbmck the Karl-Franzens 
University has an Institute for Astronomy. We would like to express our deep gratitude to this 
institute, especially to its head Prof. Dr. Hermann Haupt and two of his students, Karin Muglach and 
Robert Greirnel, for their support during the preparatory phase and the School weeks. 
We acknowledge with grateful appreciation financial support for the School from: 
- SCIENCE, the scientific stimulation programme of the Commission of the European Community; 
- the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research; 
- the Government of the Land Steiermark (Styria); 
- the City of Graz, in addition to a truly delightful reception by its mayor Alfred Stingl and City 
Counsellor Helmut Strobl; 
- the Granholm Foundation (Sweden), and 
- the Oesterreichiscbe Forschungsgemeinschaft. 
Extensive cooperation and help came from the home institute of the Local Organizer, the Vienna 
Institut f'tir Astronomic (head Prof. Dr. Paul Jackson), and especially from its collaborators Dr. 
Anneliese Schnell, Dr. Ernst Goebel and Mag. Franz Kerschbaum. 
Thanks go also to the staff of the Bildungshaus Mariatrost which provided not only dormitories and 
meeting rooms, but also a relaxed and friendly atmosphere surrounded by magnificent natural beauty. 
Last but not least, we wish to specially thank the Coordinator of EADN, Prof. Dr. Jean Heyvaerts 
who completed with his participation in the Graz School a period of five years at the helm of EADN. 
The 4th EADN School in Graz was pronounced successful by teachers and students alike. It occurred 
at a very critical point in recent European history, since its beginning coincided with the coup d'etat in 
the former Soviet Union. Together with the scientific educational values and the charming Graz 
downtown atmosphere this may have contributed to a very special feeling of togetherness of young 
European doctoral students in astrophysics during those two weeks in August 1991.

Abstract: I review the physical principles of particle acceleration in astrophysical 
objects, with an emphasis on diffusive shock acceleration. 
1 Introduction 
The subject of these lectures is the physics of energetic 
particles or photons in astrophysical plasmas. Relativistic particles play 
an important role in astrophysics. Historically, the first indication that very 
energetic particles are present in our galaxy came from the discovery of 
Cosmic Rays. Around 1910 it was realized that a component of the 
natural radioactivity measured on Earth originates in outer space. Balloon 
experiments by the Austrian phycisist Victor Hess in 1911 showed that the 
intensity of this cosmic radiation increased with height above the Earth's 
surface. We now know that our whole galaxy is pervaded 
with a 
tenuous gas of relativistic particles (protons, electrons, 0f-particles and 
heavier nuclei) with a power-law energy distribution N(E)dE ~ x E-SdF.. with 
slope s ~ 2.5 up to energies per particle of 1012 - 1014 eV. 
It is 
usually assumed that these particles are generated near the shock wave 
which propagates into the interstellar medium after a supernova explosion. 
The idea that supernovae are the 
source of cosmic rays 
was 
first 
suggested by Baade and Zwicky in 1934. 
In 1953 it became clear that the optical continuum emission of 
the Crab nebula (a remant of the supernova of 1054 AD) is polarized, 
and therefore non-thermal. Measurements by Oort, Baade and Walraven 
confirmed that we are dealing with synchrotron radiation by relativistic 
electrons in a magnetic field. This radiation mechanism had already 
been proposed by Shklovsky as a source for the radio-emission from the 
Crab. 
In 1954. Baade and Minkowski were able to identify the 
radio source Cygnus A with an optical galaxy, tconfirming the extra- 
galactic nature of many non-thermal radio sources. It is now commonly 
believed that the radio emission from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN's), 
Quasars and the extended radiolobes and jets associated with elliptical 
galaxies and quasars is due to synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons. 
There are many cases where the presence of relativistic particles has been 
inferred (directly or indirectly) in astrophysical objects. A number of 
examples is listed in Table 1.

2 Particle acceleration, general principles. 
In 
many 
astronomical 
objects 
where 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
energy is generated part of that energy is emitted 
in the 
form of 
relativistic particles. These relativistic particles must be produced by some 
acceleration process. It is important to distinguish between heating and 
acceleration. 
One speaks of heating when the available energy W is 
distributed equally between the particle population, so that the energy 
per particle roughly equals E ~ W/N, with N the total number of particles. 
A thermal (Maxwellian) distribution of particles obviously satisfies this 
requirement: the mean kinetic energy per particle equals Eth = kbT/2 
per degree-of-freedom. One speaks of acceleration when a minority of 
particles gets a significant fraction of the available energy, so that the 
energy of an individual 
particle in that minority satisfies E >> W/N 
(E >> kbT). 
2.1 Stochastic and regular Fermi acceleration 
In 1949 Enrico Fermi proposed the first serious acceleration 
mechanism in an astrophysical context 1. He proposed that the galactic 
cosmic rays are accelerated in the interstellar medium during collisions 
with magnetised clouds, which scatter the particles. In its simplest form, 
the Fermi-model can be described as a process of elastic scattering by 
moving scattering centers. Consider the following simple example. A 
particle with momentum p - Tmv is centrally scattered by a moving 
"billiard ball" which acts as a scattering center. The scattering is elastic 
in the frame K' moving with the billiard ball with velocity V. In the 
scattering event, the momentum p'll of the particle along the direction of 

V in K' is reversed, 
while the component P'I is unaffected (fig. 1). 
Denoting 
the 
various 
quantities before- 
and 
after 
scattering 
by 
the 
subscripts i and f one can find the energy change associated with this 
scattering event by 
two 
succesive 
Lorentz transforms: one 
from 
the 
laboratory frame K to K' before scattering, and the reverse 
transform 
after scattering, The relations before- and after scattering in the frame K' 
are: 
P'lli 
= 
F(PlIi 
- EiV/c2) ' 
p'llr 
= - P'lli 
' 
E' i 
-- F(Ei - VPll;) = E' r.

Fig. 1. Mealised model for Fermi acceleration. A 
particle is scattered 
by a moving scattering center. In the frame where the scattering center 
is at rest the scattering is elastic. 

There are no two possibilities: in a special geometry one can 
fix it in such a way that only head-on collisions occur. This would be 
the case if a particle were trapped between an elastically reflecting wall 
and a stream of scattering centers moving toward that wall (fig. 2) . In 
thai case the particle gains an amount of energy every time if goes 
through a cycle of reaching the wall. reflecting back into the stream 
and scattering back towards the wall starting a new cycle. How many 
scatterings there are before it reaches the wall again is unimportant. This 
is most easily seen by looking at the process in the frame moving with 
the .scattering centers: in that frame each scattering is elastic, except the 
reflection by the wall. which is moving in that frame with velocity 
-V. This version of the process is called regular Fermi acceleration. 
As we will see in the next Section this forms the basis for the process 
of acceleration of charged particles near a shock. The energy change per 
cycle is of order (V << v): 
AE ~ (Vv/c2)F... 
(4) 
The second possibility is that of particles being scattered by a 
"gas" of scattering centers moving in random directions. In that case the 
particles again gain net energy. This is due to the fact that the number 
of head-on collisions (where 
the 
particle gains energy) exceeds 
the 
number 
of overtaking 
collisions 
(where 
the 
particle 
loses 
energy). 
Assuming again v

and 
collisional cross section o, . the encounter rate for a given (fixed) direction 
of V equals: 
R. ~ n,o,lv 
Vl ~ n.%v(l - v'V)

(5) 
Head-on collisions (v.V < O) are indeed more frequent than overtaking 
collisions (v-V > O). The net energy 
gain per unit time follows by 
averaging R,× AE (Eqn. 3) over all possible directions of V:

This version of the process is called stochastic Fermi acceleration.

Fig. 2. Simple 
model 
for regular and 
stochastic Fermi 
acceleration. 
The regular 
version of the proces requires a special geometry 
such 
as a unidirectional stream of scattering centers. 
If one compares the energy-gain per scattering for this proces with the 
gain per cycle (4) for the regular proces one sees that this process is 
less efficient by a factor ~ v/V. This is the result of the near-cancellation 
(to order V/v << 1) of the number of head-on and overtaking collisions. 
There is a second important difference between regular and 
stochastic Fermi acceleration. In the regular proces all particles gain 
roughly the same amount of energy in each cycle, equal to the magnitude 
of the energy change IAEI ~ (Vv/c2)E per collision, In the stochastic 
process however the mean energy increase per collision <AE> is much 
less than 
the 
energy 
change 
AE per 
individual 
collision: 
<AE> 
(V/v)lAEI. This means that the particles in the latter process not only 
gain energy, but that they also disperse in energy. For V << v 
the 
energy change at each scattering equals AE .~ ((V,v)/c2)E which can 
have either sign with almost equal probability. This means that particles 
at an energy E go through a (slightly biased) random walk in energy 
with stepsize AE. Two particles starting out at the same energy will in 
general diffuse away from each other in energy. 
The amount of dispersion can be calculated by considering 
the quantity ~E - hE - <AE>. The average value <~E> is (by definition) 
zero. But from Eqns. 3-6 one can calculate that SE 2 increases in time. 
Assuming once again V << v and using <~E2> = <hE2> - <AE> 2 ~ <AE2> 
one gets:

The spectn.tm due to stochastic Fermi acceleration. 
The above results can be applied to calculate the energy 
distribution one expects as a 
result of the 
Fermi 
process. Stochastic 
acceleration will be considered first. For relativistic particles with v ~. c 
one can define the mean velocity <dE/dt> and a diffusion coefficient

by 
a

as the confusion equation in some

be the number-density of particles with

diffusion coefficient D E by the expression: 
S(E,t) - c/dE ~N(E,t) - 8---(D N(E t)~

This

In the steady-state (MSt - O) the solution is a power-law N(E) oc E -s. 
When particles are injected into the acceleration proces at rate R with 
an energ~ E ° one has Q(E,t) = R~(E - Eo ) " The solution of (12) reads in

active galaxies and some quasars.

Stochastic acceleration by plasma waves and turbulence 
2.3.1 Basic principles 
In this 
section 
I 
will 
briefly 
consider 
a 
more 
realistic 
description of stochastic particle acceleration. Consider a particle subject 
to a 
random 
force. For simplicity I will consider the one-dimensional 
case. The dynamics of the particle is described by: 
dp 
- 
F(x.t) 
, <<Fix.t)>> 
-- O. 
414) 
dt 
This random force could for instance be due to random electromagnetic 
fields associated with waves in a plasma, and is a function of the 
position x and time t. The averaging bracket << >> in this case is to be 
interpreted in a statistical sense as an ensemble 
average 
. The trajectory 

10 
of the particle is x -- X(t). The change in momentum of the particle 
between t - 0 and t -- At can be found by integrating along the particle 
trajectory: 
At 
o 
The timeointegral and the ensemble average can be interchanged, and if 
one assumes that the change in the particle orbit under the influence of 
the random force can be neglected, one immediately finds to lowest 
order: 
At 
<<Ap>> = .jdt'<<FCX' ,t')>> = O. 
(16) 
o 
This means that the particle tends to random-walk 
in momentum. 
centered around 
the momentum 
it originally started with 
at t 
O. 
Although the mean 
displacement in 
momentum 
<<Ap>> vanishes 
to 
lowest order, <<Ap2>> increases. Using (15) once again one has: 
At 
At 
<< Ap Ap>> : [d[' [dt" << F(X',t') F(X",t" )>>. 
i17) 
o 
o 
Here I have introduced the notation X' -= X(t'). Specifically, consider the 
case of acceleration 
by 
waves 
in a plasma. A 
plasma 
supports 
a 
veritable 
Zoo of plasma waves of electrostatic-, electromagnetic- 
and 
mixed types s. For the present discussion we will only need the fact that 
in that case the force F(x,f) can be expanded using a Fourier-integral 
(essentially a continuous super~sition of plane waves): 
Fix.t) = [ d3k 
FCk)exp/ik'x- i~(k)t) 
. 
Ji2x) 3 
(18) 
Here a~(k) is the frequency of the wave under consideration, and F(k) 
the Fourier-amplitude of Fix,t). The Fourier-amplitude generally 
is a 
complex number. It satisfies the relation F'(-k) : F'~(k) , which together 
with a~(-k) -- -a~'(k) ensures that Fix,t) is a real quantity. One can show 
that 
in a spabally homogeneous, stationary ensemble of waves 
the 
Fourier-amplitudes have an ensemble average which satisfies the following 
relation: 
Expanding each of the two factors F(k) in (16) in a Fourier integral

(one over d k and one over d k ) and using the property (19) one can write 
Eqn. (17) after integration over k':

(20) 
The remaining integral over k contains an exponential term of the form 
e iS which fluctuates strongly in time. The simplest case obtains when 
there is no magnetic field. The unperturbed orbit of the particle in that 
case is a straight line: X(t) = X 
÷ yr. This means that the phase S in 
the exponential term in integral ~19) is given by: 
S 
= 
(k'v-a~(k))(t"- 
t'). 
(21) 
Defining new 
variables T = (t" ÷ t')/2 and 
r 
= it" - 
t' ) one 
can 
evaluate the integral using dr'dr" = dTd'r. S depends only on "r so the 
integral over T can be evaluated trivially:

k.v - to(k) 
- At 
In the limit At --> 
co one can use the following theorem involving the 
Dirac delta-function: limt_>oosin(xt)/x = ~rg(x). This allows one to evaluate 
Eqn. (22) for large At, defining the momentum

(24) 
This result has a simple interpretation. The g-function in (24) selects those 
waves for which the resonance-condition to 
- 
k'v 
= 0 is satisfied. Those 
are exactly the waves which have a constant phase S ( ~ 
oc e is ) as 
seen by the particle along its unperturbed 
orbit. As a result, the force 
excerted on the particle 
by 
these 
resonant 
waves 
does 
not 
fluctuate 
wildly in time and is able to change 
the momentum 
appreciably. 
In 
contrast, the action on the momentum 
of non-resonant 
waves 
averages 
out. 
If the particle propagates through a magnetised plasma with a 
mean 
magnetic 
field 
B 
the 
resonance 
condition 
becomes 
more 
complicated. The reason is that the unperturbed 
orbit is now 
a 
spiral 
along 
the 
magnetic 
field 
This 
spiralling 
motion 
results 
in 
the 
appearance 
of so-called 
gyro-resonances 
involving 
harmonics 
of 
the 

12 
gyration frequency

of the 
particle. 
The 
resonance 
condition in this case reads:

Here kll and vii are the components of the wave-vector k and particle velocity 
v along the magnetic field, e.g. kll - k'B/IBI. 
The result C24) is easily generalised to more spatial dimensions. 
In the unmagnetised case. one defines the momentum-diffusion tensor Dij by : 
Dij =

(26) 
The change and energy <dE/dr> and the energy diffusion 
coefficient D E associated with this momentum diffusion can be derived 
by the following argument• Let dN -- 4np2f(x.t. p)dpdV be the number 
of particles in a infinitesimal volume d V with momentum in the range

able 
to 
induce such fluctuations 
in

are 
the so-called fast

resides in the component B'

and energy diffusion coefficient for relativistic particles (v ~ c. E ~ pc) 
follows from (29) as: 
2 
These relations have exactly the same form as the relations (9) derived 
using the simple model for Fermi-acceleration of the previous Section. 
Note however that the physical assumptions used to derive these results 
are different in the two cases . 
In the simple model for Fermi-acceleration of Section 2.1 it 
was assumed that the scattering centers deflect the particle through a 
large angle 
at 
each 
scattering. 
This 
is 
called integral scattering 
Furthermore the scattering was described as a series of impulsive events 
rather than as the influence of a 
force acting 
continuously 
on 
the 
particle, as was done in this Section. This gave a value of 0r ; "~ 
-| in 
acc 
terms of the mean-free-path X and the magnitude of the velocity V of 
the scattering centers as ~ ~ 8V2/3cX. 

15 
In the case under consideration here a particle is deflected 
continuously by the magnetic fluctuations. The angle of deflection A per 
"scattering" is only small: A ~ 8B/B 
per wavelength k This is called 
o 
differenSal scaffering . As a result, the effecSve mean free path where 
these small deflections diffusively add up to a large angle of order 7r/2 
equals Xef f ~ )~/A 2 ~ )~B2/gB 2 . This explains the appearance of the 
o 
extra factor (SB/B)2 in the expression for ~ in this case. The waves 
o 
propagate with a velocity V A, so the Alfv~n speed is indeed the correct 
velocity for the scattering centers . 
When the magnetic fluctuations become strong so that 6B ~, 
Bo one has left ~ k so ~ ~ 4~V2/3c)~ . and the two 
approaches are 
equivalent up to factors of order unity. In that case the energ~ density 
of the average field B 2/87r and of the fluctuations ( ~ 35B /8~) are 
o 
roughly the same. In that case one speaks of sfrong turbulence. The 
derivation given here is then on shaky 
ground: in particular the 
assumption 
that the 
momentum 
change 
can 
be 
calculated 
using 
unperturbed particle orbits becomes 
highly questionable. It was this 
assumption that led to the appearance of the resonance condition. 
The above method of calculating the non-linear interaction 
between particles and turbulent waves is known in the plasma-physics 
community 
as the quasi-linear approximation. ][ is often difficult to 
ascertain its validity, but as a tool for making 
order-of-magnitude 
estimates it is useful. 
2.4 
" Fermi deceleration': expansion losses 
Consider a particle interacting with scattering centers which

The energy balance in stochastic Fermi acceleration 
So 
far, 
I 
have 
treated 
the 
acceleration 
process 
from 
a 
single-particle 
point 
of 
view, 
neglecting 
the 
back-reaction 
of 
all 
accelerated particles on 
the 
"scattering 
centers" 
which 
provide 
the 
acceleration. 
This 
is 
the 
test-particle approximation 
in 
which 
one 
considers the circumstances leading to the acceleration (wave turbulence) 
as given. In reality, the energy gained by all particles involved in the 
acceleration process is acquired at the expense of the energy of the 
scattering centers or waves responsible for the acceleration, which will 
lose energy. This back-reaction of the particles on the accelerating agent 
must be taken into account. 
Let us once again consider the simple model of Sections 2.2. , 
allowing for energy-independent escape of the particles from the region 
where the acceleration takes place and injection of particles at a rate R 
per unit volume with energy E

The second term on the right hand side ~U_ : fdE <dE/dt>N(E,t) is just

(42) 
The first term on the right-hand-side is the net amount of energy fed 
into the scattering centers per unit time, and the second term the energy 
extracted by the accelerated particles. Consider the case where energy 
is fed continously into the scattering centers (waves), and the system 
reaches a steady-state with 8/c)t ; O. The energy-balance equations (41)

In that case the level of waves and particles in the source adjusts in

of energy fed per unit time into the

This would be realized provided z/RE 
~ 2, i.~e. twice as much energy is 
injected into the region in the form o~ turbulent waves than in the form 
of particles. In principle this is an attractive idea, since it reduces the 
problem of the observed spectra to a one-parameter problem, which 
except for the parameter z/RE 
does not directly involve the other 
o 
physical conditions of the source. However, there is no a-priori reason 
why E/RE ° would take roughly the same value in all sources, as seems 
to be implied by observations. 
3. Particle acceleration near astrophysical shocks 
About fifteen 
years 
ago, 
several 
authors 6-9 
independently 
proposed the mechanism of diffusive shock-acceleration as a possible 
astrophysical source of energetic particles in our own galaxy (e.g. cosmic 
rays) or in active galaxies and quasars. In this mechanism, particles gain 
energy during repeated scattering across a shock front. This energy gain 
is clue to the fact that "scattering centers" advected with the bulk flow 
in the up- and downstream region near the shock converge relative to 
each other due to the compression created at the shockfront, see fig. 3, 
As such this mechanism is a physical realization of the regular Fermi 
mechanism of, ,Secti°n II.l. The mean energy gain per shock crossing is of 
order 
hE 
/Auv/c)E (c.f. Eqn. 4), corresponding to a momentum gain 
Ap ~ (Au/v)p. Here Au - (u 
- u+)-n the velocity difference across the 

18 
shock, u 
(u,) the fluid velocity ahead of (behind) the shock, n is the 
shock normal and v the particle velocity. 
The 
necessary 
scattering 
can 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
fluid 
particles themselves in the case of Thomson scattering of photons by 
electrons 
in 
an 
ionized plasma. For charged 
particles it is due 
to 
collective 
effects, 
in 
particular 
gyro-resonant 
scattering 
of 
charged 
particles by short-wavelength MHD waves (wrinkles in the magnetic 
field) .

SHOCK 
Fig, 3. Physical picture of shock-acceleration. Scattering centers advected 
with a flow converge relative to each other at a shock front. The role of 
the shock is to create a compression in the gas. For a normal shock as 
shown here this compression is given by r = u_/u 
= P /O_ ,where 9 is the 
density of the gas. Particles gain energy every time they complete a cycle 
of crossing the shock from the downstream to the upstream region and back. 
The rate at which particles cross the shock is proportional to 
the scattering rate. The scattering maintains a good coupling between the 
bulk 
fluid 
and 
the 
accelerated 
particles. 
This 
results 
in 
diffusive 
propagation which traps particles near the shock front in a "boundary 
layer". This in turn allows a small fraction of particles to gain energies 
far in excess of the mean kinetic energy mu2/2 per particle, of mass m 
S 
in the upstream flow as seen from a shock propagating with velocity u. 
$ 
The 
simplest version of the 
mechanism 
assumes 
that 
the 
scattering mean-free- path X 
> d with d the thickness of the shock. 
rrtfp 
The shock is then treated as a discontinuity. If this ordering not satisfied. 

19 
particles or photons no longer see the shock as a discontinuity, but as a 
continuous transition in the flow velocity. Particles then gain energy at 
rate determined by the local compression rate V'u in the flow, c.f. Eqn 
(39). 
In what follows , 1 will review some of the features of the 
shock-acceleration process, with an emphasis on the various astrophysical 
applications. For more detailed derivations of various equations I refer to 
the review by R. D. Blandford and D. Eichler 1°. 
3.1. 
A simple statistical model 
Consider a simple case of a planar, infinitely thin and steady 
shock. A scattering mechanism operating on both sides of the shock front 
ensures that particles are scattered repeatedly across the shock. I will 
define a cycle as an event in which a particle with momentum 
p 
crosses the shock from downstream to upstream and (after some time) 
back again. One can define the following (suitably averaged) quantities: 
momentum change/cycle: 
probability of escape/cycle: 
probability of destruction/cycle: 
A(p) << p, 
P(p) << I, 
A(p) << I. 
(44) 
Let dN - n(p)dp be the number of particles in the momentum interval 
" lP, 
P 
* dp) 
currently involved in 
the 
acceleration 
process. 
After 
completing 
one 
cycle, 
the 
various 
quantities 
have 
undergone 
an 
average change according to: 
p 
> p : p ÷ A(p) , 
(45a) 
dp 
> dp ~ (1 * c)g(p) )dp, 
(45b) 
~)p 
dN- 
n(p)dp 
> dN =- n(p)dp 
- (1 - P(p) - A(p))dN.(45c) 
Equation (45c) assumes 
that 
no 
particles are 
added 
to the 
pool of 
accelerating particles at momentum p. Substituting Eqns. (45a) and (45b) 
into Eqn.(45c) and making a Taylor expansion to first order yields a 
differential equation for n(p). This shows how the distribution n(p) results 
from the competition between momentum gain and particle losses: 
c) (A(p)n(p))=- 
(P(p) ÷ A(p))n(p)-=-W(p)n(p). 
(46) 
Here I have defined W(p): P(p) • A(p) which is the total probability 
for a particle to be removed from the acceleration process during one 
cycle. Integrating Eqn. (46) gives the differential number 
density of 
particles participating in the acceleration: 

20 
A(p o) 
n(p) - n(Po) A(p) 
p 
Po 
(47) 
The integration constant n(Po) is determined by the injection process. If 
the escape of particles from the acceleration process is due to advection 
into the downstream medium, as is usually the case. an observer behind 
the 
shock 
will 
measure 
a 
particle 
distribution emerging 
into 
the 
downstream region proportional to P(p)nfp): 
p 
Po 
(48) 
Here 
F.(p)dp 
is the 
number-density 
of particles in 
the 
momentum 
interval ( p.p • dp) in the downstream region. The constant × must be 
calculated from a detailed consideration of the boundary conditions at 
the shock. 
3.2. 
Diffusive shock acceleration of charged particles 
The 
most 
straightforward 
example 
of this 
process 
is 
the 
acceleration of charged particles near a normal shock propagating in a 
magnetised plasma, l will assume that the scattering process is elastic in 
the rest frame of the plasma. When scattering is due to the interaction of 
the 
charged 
particles 
with 
low-frequency 
MHD 
waves 
it 
can 
be 
considered elastic provided the wave phase velocity in the plasma rest 
frame 
I~/kl << u 
with u 
the shock velocity. Scattering keeps 
the 
$ 
s 
particle distribution nearly isotropic in the rest frameof 
the plasma on 
both sides of the shock. No particles are destroyed in this case so one has 
A(p) - O. 
Let the lab frame K be the frame where the shock is at rest. 
In that frame the fluid streams into the shock with velocity u 
= u 
and 
- 
S 
leaves the shock with velocity u 
= u/r where r > 1 is the compression 
* 
$ 
ratio. I will look at the process in terms of the energy change in the 
frame K in which the downstream medium is at rest. In that frame the 
shock moves with velocity Us/r towards positive x. 
A 
particle will cross the shock into 
the 
upstream 
medium 
provided v

= u /r . corresponding to an angle ~'. with respect to

upstream it crosses back into the downstream region at an angle ~t" 
÷ 
where us/rv i. > cos ,0,f e -1 , completing one cycle. All these quantities 
are defined in the rest-frame K of the downstream fluid. Seen from that 
frame, the upstream scattering centers approach at a velocity Au given 
by the usual law for velocity addition in relativity:

Conversely, an observer at rest in the rest frame K of the upstream fluid 
sees the downstream scattering centers approach with velocity -Au. 
The energy with which it enters the upstream flow as seen from 
the rest frame K 
of the upstream flow equals:

When it re-enters the downstream flow across 
Here F 
the shock its energy in the frame K_ is unchanged: 
the scattering which 
has taken place in between is elastic in that frame. So one can use the 
the same transformation: 
E-r= FE'/(1÷ (v't.Aucos~r/c2)) = E-i= FE~(1 * (v; Aucos4~i/c 2) ). 
From this one immediately finds the ratio of the initial and final energy in 
the downstream rest frame K 
after the completion of one cycle: 
E*r 
(1 + (V~. AUCOS~i/C2)) 
( 
+ aucos~t/J) )

1 +(v r 
(51) 
Note that the limits on the values of cos~.~ and cos~" t given above ensure 
that E 7 > Ei ~ so the particle always gains energy during one cycle. 
This is an implicit equation which one can solve using v/c = 
= (y2_ 1)/y2. However, 
in the limiting case &u/v" << 1 (and therefore 
u 
<< c ) and in the 
case of highly 
relativistic particles or photons 
(v'.

1 * (hu/c)cos~j. 
If au << v. c both expressions are equivalent. I will consider that case first. 
It is convenient to rewrite (53) in terms of the particle momentum 
p = Ev/c 2, dropping the subscript i in the process:

boundaries downstream allowing free escape, the particles are dragged 
along with the downstream fluid, with an average velocity equal to the 
streaming velocity u 
behind the shock. Seen from the lab-frame, where 
the shock is stationary, this corresponds to a net flux of particles with 
momentum p into the downstream region equal to: 
Z.(p) 
~ u F(p) ÷ O(u/v). 
(57] 
Here F.(p)dp is the number density of particles with momentum in the

The integration constant F O follows from an elementary consideration of 
particle conservation. Let us assume that a seed-distribution of particles is 
present far upstream of the form F_(p) = n_~(p - po ), isotropic in the 
rest-frame of the plasma. The corresponding flux of particles advected 
into the shock equals X(p) = usF(p). The flux into the downstream 
region 
equals 
Z (p) 
u F.(p) 
- 
UsF.(p)/r. 
Since 
no 
particles 
are 
destroyed, particle conservation in the steady state implies fdpZ_(p) = 
=fdpZ(p). 
All particles are accelerated, 
so F (p) = 0 
for p 
< Po" 
Performing the integrals yields the relation F O =*3rPoln_/(r - 1). So we 
arrive at the final result, valid in the steady stale for a monoenerge[ic 
population of seed particles with number-density n in the upstream region: 
r..e_2 
F+(p) - r 3r_ 1 pon- (Po)- r-1 
( P ~ PO) " 
(61) 
What is remarkable about this result is that this steady-state 
spectrum does not depend on the details of the scattering process. In 
contrast, the spectrum for stochastic Fermi acceleration (Eqn. 13) contains 
the parameter 
aT 
; 
escape 
time/acceleration 
time 
which 
sensitively 
depends on the scattering rate v/),. The reason for this behaviour is that 
in shock acceleration the particle only gains net energy every time it 
completes a cycle and not per scattering event. Only when it returns to 
the downstream region and is scattered there does the energy change 
become 
irreversible. 
This 
situation 
is 
completely 
analogous 
to 
the 
example used in Section 2.1 of a particle being scattered by a uniform 
stream of scattering centers streaming towards an elastically reflecting 
wall, The only difference is that the wall is replaced by a second set of 
scattering centers. The function of the shock is to create a velocity 
difference between the two sets of scattering centers.

only on the compression r at the shock. 
A 
power-law does not contain any intrinsic momentum scale. This is in 
contrast for example with an exponential distribution F(p) c~ e -°p which 
contains the intrinsic momentum scale p ~ 0 -1 
When the particles far upstream ("seed particles") are not all 
at the same momentum, but in a distribution F_(p) so that dN = F_(p)dp is 
the number-density of particles in the range (p, p÷dp) far ahead of the 
shock, the downstream distribution of accelerated particles is given by:

In a perfect classical fluid with specific-heat-ratio F : 
5/3 the 
maximum compression in a shock equals r = (F ÷ 1)/(F - l) = 4 (ref. 11). 
The slope of the distribution therefore has a minimum value (r *2]/[r - l] 
: (3F- 1]/2 : 2. 
3.3. Cycle time and momentum gain for particles in shock acceleration 
The maximum energy particles can gain in the process of 
shock acceleration is determined by energy losses or the finite age and 
size of the shock. Here the influence of the scattering becomes important. 
The scattering rate ,J, or equivalently the mean-free-path k ,~, v/~ 
of 
$ 
s 
the particles, determines how 
many 
shock 
crossings occur 
per unit 
time . This crossing rate in turn determines the rate at which particles 
gain momentum. 
Consider 
a 
particle crossing 
the 
shock 
into the 
upstream 
regiop. After its first upstream scattering it starts diffusing with respect to 
the upstream flow. In most cases that diffusion is one-dimensional, 
guided 
by the magnetic field. The reason is that particles are tied to the field in 
their spiralling motion by the Lorentz force. They can slide freely along 
the field like beads along a wire. Diffusion 
across 
the field may 
be 
neglected in most circumstances. 
l consider again the case of a normal shock (fig. 3 ] where 
the magnetic field is along the x-axis. Seen from the rest-frame K of the 
upstream flow the particle starts at a distance x 
~ k 
in front of the

shock. Given the scattering frequency ~ it travels a distance ~x ,~ v /~

The mean momentum gain per cycle equals Ap = (4Au/3v)p. So, while

Here I have defined an "effective mean-free-path" by ~ - 3(r~. + r2~. )/4(r- 1). 
This result looks quite similar to the result (6) for stochastic 
Fermi acceleration. The difference is that the relevant velocity here is 
the shock velocity u 
which in general is much larger than the velocity 
of the scattering cer~ters ( ~ the Alfven-velocity V A for scattering by 
magnetic irregularities). Therefore the acceleration proceeds on a much 
shorter timescale. In most cases the mean-free-path)~ on either side of 
the shock depends on the momentum p, i.e. k = ~.(p). This momentum 
dependence reflects the details of the scattering process.

The raammum energy attainable in shock acceleration 
The 
energy-gain due 
1o shock 
acceleration 
for 
relativistic 
particles with Lorentz-factor y >> 1 follows from (58) by using v ~,c , E

Writing this 
equation 
in 
terms 
of 
y, 
introducing a 
mean 
energy-loss per unit time corresponding to - <dy/dt>loss, the particle 
experiences a net energy gain according to:

For a strong hydrodyna__mical shock in an ideal gas with compression

obtains when the energy gain per cycle equals the mean loss incurred 
in a cycle time so the two terms on the right-hand- side of Eqn. (69) 
balance. 
In a situation where losses can be neglected the maximum 
energy achieved by particles depends on the time T ( e.g. age of the 
shock) available for acceleration, and the injection Lorentz factor Yo" This 
follows from the implicit equation:

3.5. 
Gyro--re~nant scattering by Alfv6n waves 
The scattering mechanism most often invoked in the context 
of diffusive shock acceleration is gyro-resonant pitch-angle scattering on 
low-frequency MHD waves, such as Alfv&n waves 
. Particles with 
charge Ze gyrating around a magnetic field B 
with gyro-radius of 
o 
order R L = pc/ZelBoJ are scattered by waves with frequency to and 
wavevector k satisfying the resonance condition to - kttvll * f)B = 0 . 
Here kll -~ k'Bo/IBo], vii = V-Bo/IBo[ and {)B ~ ZeJBo]/ymc is the 
cyclotron frequency . I will consider Alfven waves propagating along 
the magnetic field, so that k -- kjlBo/IBol . If we put the magnetic field 
along the z-axis the Alfven waves have a magnetic field perturbation 
associated with them given by (compare Eqn. 18] ' 
2rt 
(71] 
Here toA = kll VA is the Alfven frequency, with V A = B /y/(47rn m ) .

wave 
given by (71) is a circularly polarized wave where the magnetic field 
8B rotates through 360 ° around B ° over one wavelength X : 
2~/kj[ . 
The particle completes one rotation in one gyroperiod At B -- 2~/Q B. and 
in that time it travels a distance As = viiht : 
2~vg/Q B along the 
magnetic 
field. 
The 
particle 
will 
preserve 
the 
relative 
orientation

provided if travels one wavelength in one gyroperiod. So (up to a sign) 
one must have: 
As -- 2~vff/~

(75) 
In that case the wave-induced Lorentz force F = (q/c)v × 8B has a constant

particle orbit.

A special case is the limitation placed on the acceleration 
process by the geometry or time-dependence of the shock. So far, it was 
assumed 
that 
the 
shock 
is 
infinitely 
large 
and 
infinitely 
old. 
The 
geometry of the shock places a limitation on the maximum energy for 
the following reason. In front of the shock accelerated particles form a 
so-called precursor. This precursor has a scale of order /, ~ u /D. This is 
s 
the scale at which diffusion of particles away from the shock is exactly 
compensated by advection of particles into the shock by the upstream 
flow. Putting the distance hx that a particle can "diffuse away from the 
shock in a time t equal to the distance the fluid travels towards the 
shock in the same period one has (c.f. Eqn. 53):

For the 
scaling of the 
diffusion coefficient adopted 
here 
relativistic 
particles have a precursor length L ~, /cy/3~us)R ° . Particles with higher 
energy are able to get further ahead of the shock. If the shock itself has 
size L, the particles will "notice" the finite size of the shock if L ~ L. At 
higher energies particles get so far ahead of the shock that they are 
likely to miss it when they are scattered back. The coupling between 
the fluid and the particles has become 
too weak 
to make 
efficient 
acceleration possible. This will occur at a value of y of the order:

This limitation due to the size of the shock will be important for young 
shocks. For very old (and therefore very large) shocks the limitation on 
particle energy will generally be due to radiative or collisional losses of 
the particles. 
3.7. 
Astrophysical sites of shock acceleration. 
Shock acceleration is expected to operate at a 
variety 
of 
astrophysical 
objects. 
These 
include 
blast 
waves 
which 
result 
from 
explosive phenomena such as Solar or stellar flares and supernovae , the 
bow shock of Earth and other planets , the outer edge of shock-bounded 
bubbles 
blown 
into the 
interstellar medium 
by 
stellar winds 
, the 
so-called 
super-bubbles 
which 
result 
from 
sequential 
supernovae 
in 
OB-star associations in the galactic plane. 
The collimated supersonic outflows (jets) associated with Young 
Stellar Objects . galactic X-ray sources such as SS433, and Cygnus X-3 , 
and the nuclei of active galaxies and quasars are terminated by a strong 
shock where they impinge on the interstellar or intergalactic medium. In 
the case of active galaxies and radio-loud quasars one, sees extended 
radio lobes. In the stronger radio galaxies (the so-called Fanaroff-Riley It 
sources with a 
radio luminosity exceeding L 
~ 
1034 erg/s per Hz 
'u 
around ~ ~ 1.4 Ghz) one sees the so-called "hot spots" where the jets 
terminate. One usually assumes that these hot spots are the sites of strong 
in situ particle acceleration associated with the terminating shocks. For a 
review see Meisenheimer and Rdser 15. 
Further possible sites of shock acceleration are accretion flows. 
In accretion disks mass slowly spirals towards a compact object such as 
a 
white 
dwarf, 
neutron 
star or black 
hole under 
the 
influence 
of 
frictional forces and 
possibly dissipation in 
shocks. 
The 
gravitational 
binding energy liberated in this fashion is thought to be the primary 
energy 
source 
powering 
non-thermal 
emission 
and 
the 
(collimated) 
outflows from Young 
Stellar Objects, galactic X-ray 
sources 
active 
galaxies and 
quasars. 
In 
accretion 
flows 
with 
little or 
no 
angular 
momentum standing accretion shocks have been proposed as a site of 
efficient particle acceleration *6. 

31 
The acceleration process 
requires a 
strong 
coupling 
through 
scattering between the energetic particles and the bulk flow. Therefore 
there is the danger of particles being "dragged" with the flow to the 
compact object, none reaching an observer at infinity. In particular this 
is true for quasi-spherical accretion flows, which do not have an "edge" 
like an accretion disk, across which particles can escape to infinity. This 
has been discussed recently in some detail for spherical accretion by 
Schneider and Bogdan 17. 
It is im~ssible, within the limited confines of this review, to 
do justice to all the fine points and outstanding problems of the theory 
of shock 
acceleration or particle acceleration in general 
in all these 
various objects. In table 3 I have summarized the typical parameters for 
the shock acceleration process 
in a 
number 
of astrophysical 
objects. 
These include the size. age 
and shock 
velocity u 
. the mechanism 
limiting the energy gain and the maximum 
value s of 7 that can 
be 
reached, according to the expressions given in table 2 of the previous

3. 8 Observational evidence for shock acceleration. 
3. 8.1 
Interplanetary shocks 
The best direct evidence for shock acceleration comes from 
observations from spacecraft. In a number of quasi-parallel interplanetary 
shocks ( i.e. B and n aligned within 45°3 energetic protons and an 
associated enhancement of MHD wave activity has been recorded more 
than an hour before the shock passes the spacecraft. The observations 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
theory 
of 
diffusive 
shock 
acceleration. 
Accelerated particles "boiling off " the shock form a precursor in the 
upstream region with a typical dimension L ~ D/u 
. the typical scale 
s 
on which the diffusion of particles away 
from 
the 
shock, 
and 
the 
advection with the flow into the shock balance each other. The angular 
distribution of 
the 
accelerated 
particles in 
the 
precursor 
region 
is 
anisotropic. For super-AlfvSnic shocks with u s > V 
--- IBI/'/(4~O) this 
anisotropy is sufficient to generate Alfven waves ~y a gyro-resonant 
two-stream instability. These waves provide the scattering needed to trap 
particles near the shock. Similar observations have been made at the 
bow-shocks 
of 
Earth 
and 
Jupiter, 
but 
the 
interpretation 
of 
these 
measurements is difficult. 
3.8.2 Cosmic-ray acceleration in the Galaxy 
In all other cases, the evidence is more or less circumstantial. 
The best studied case is cosmic-ray acceleration by supernova remnants 
(SNR)in our galaxy. The observed spectrum of galactic cosmic rays, 
when corrected for the (energy dependent) shielding influence of the 
heliosphere, 
is 
a 
power-law 
in 
kinetic 
energy 
T 
~- 
(¥- 
l)mc2: 
dN/dT - xT -2"7 for T in the range of 3 - 10 5 GeV/nucleon 19. Above that 
range, the spectrum 
seems 
to flatten, and 
then 
steepen 
again. 
This 
power-law behaviour is followed by protons and other primary nuclei, 
but the elemental abundances at a given energy/nucleon differ significantly 
from Solar values. 
The global energetics of cosmic rays in the Galaxy seems to 
support 
the 
idea of SNR as the 
primary 
sources 20'21. 
A 
supernova 
typically releases 
an 
energy 
Esn r 
~. 10 51 
erg 
into 
the 
interstellar 
medium, 
mostly 
in 
the form of kinetic 
energy 
of the 
ejecta 
and 
swept-up interstellar matter. The supernova rate Qsnr is estimated at 1 per 
30-100 years . Cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy is usually described 
in terms of the so-called "leaky box model" 2o.21 in which a typical cosmic 
ray is retained in the Galaxy for about t 
~ 3 × 10 6 yr in a "confinement 
65 
3 
. 
r 
volume" of about V ,~ 10 
cm . This corresponds to a dilute halo with a 
thickness at least 5 times that of the stellar disk i.e. a scale height of about 
H ~ 1 kpc above the galactic plane. This idea is confirmed by observations of 
diffuse synchrotron emission from cosmic-ray electrons in neighbourin 9 spiral 
galaxies. 

33 
The retention time is derived by measuring the amount of 
secondary cosmic rays produced in collisions between primary cosmic 
rays an nuclei in the interstellar medium. Calculations show 
that 
a 
typical primary cosmic ray sees a "grammage" <~>L ~ 14g/cm 2. Here 
<p> is the mean density of matter in the confinement volume, and L -~, 
ct the typical total pathlength. One of products of these collisions is the 
radioactive isotope r°Be with a lifetime of about 4 × 10 6 yr. From 
measuring its abundance one can also estimate the retention time t. 
r 
Since the corresponding path-length L ~ 3 ×10 6 ly ~ 1 Mpc is much 
larger that the thickness of this diffuse halo surrounding our galaxy 
(H ~ 
1 kpc ) the propagation of a 
cosmic ray 
must 
be diffusive. 
From the properties of random 
walks one 
can 
estimate the 
typical 
cosmic ray mean-free-path), from the number of steps a cosmic ray 
needs to reach the edge of the flattened halo if it starts in the middle 
of the galactic disk:

Stellar winds have been proposed as a source of cosmic rays. mainly on 
the ground that the isotopic abundances of cosmic rays resemble those 
observed in the coronae of the Sun and other active stars . However. 
the power dissipated by stellar winds in the interstellar medium is about 
a factor 5 less than that put in by supernovae. The efficiency with 
which this power would have 
to be converted into cosmic rays is 
correspondingly larger, which seems unlikely. 
It is 
also 
suggestive 
that 
the 
break 
in 
the 
cosmic-ray 
spectrum at about 1014 eV/nucleon (which corresponds to T ~ 10 6) is 
intriguingly close to the value of "(max estimated for the process of 
shock acceleration by SNR blastwaves (table 3 ). This suggests 
that 
primary cosmic rays below 1014 eV/nucleon originate at SNR. but that 
particles at higher 
energies 
have 
a 
different origin. Acceleration at 
superbubbles could give Tmax ,~ 10 7 if scattering is very efficient so

if one believes that shock acceleration is the process responsible for the 
production of these UHE 
particles, one needs either a very large, or a 
very fast shock. This has lead to the suggestion that these particles are 
accelerated at the termination shock of a galactic wind with L ,~ 300 
kpc. u s ,~ 400 km/s 
and B ,-~ 1 [/G 23 
. 
For protons this gives a

x (L/300 kpc)B G. Other nuclei with a mass m - Am 
and charge Ze 
can boost Ymax by a factor Z/A and the energy byPa factor Z. It is 
therefore very important to measure the chemical composition of the 
UHE cosmic rays. The occurence of high-Z nuclei above 1015 eV such as 
members of the Iron group (Z = 26, A ~ 54) would be much easier to 
account for than, say, 4He with Z - 2 A = 4. The low particle flux

3.9 "Realistic" shock acceleration: non-linear effects. 
Most of the estimates derived in this paper have been based 
on a test-particle approach in which particles are accelerated by a shock 
of prescribed strength in a simple, one-dimensional flow. This test-particle 
approximation, 
although useful for making estimates, is not likely 
to 
apply in practice if shock acceleration is efficient in the sense that a 
2 
P is converted 
significant fraction of the incoming momentum flux pu s * 
into energy density of accelerated 
(i.e. 
non-thermal) 
particles 
at 
the 
shock. It is important to realize that shock acceleration is by its very 
nature a very non-linear process: the energy gained by the particles at 
the shock is extracted from the kinetic energy of the incoming flow. 
This will influence the strength of the shock by slowing down the 
upstream flow. 
The strong coupling between 
the accelerated particles (or 
photons) and 
the 
bulk 
flow mediated 
by 
scattering 
is a 
necessary 
ingredient of the theory, even though the details of the scattering do not 
enter directly into the resulting distribution of accelerated particles. This 
coupling allows the bulk fluid to feel the pressure-gradients in the gas of 
accelerated particles ("radiation pressure"). The precursor formed by the 
accelerated particles in the upstream region slows down the incoming 
fluid due to the associated pressure gradient VFI , with the pressure 
particles given by H(x,t) -= fdpF(p,x,t)(pv/3). 
of the accelerated 
The effect of an increasing particle pressure towards the shock 
is twofold. First of all, the deceleration of the incoming flow leads to a 
weaker (viscous) subshock with compression r < 4. If enough energy is 
put into the accelerated 
particles, the 
viscous 
subshock 
is erased 
altogether, and one is left with a "cosmic-ray dominated" or "radiation 
dominated" shock in which the velocity changes smoothly over several 
precursor scales. Secondly, for flat spectra one expects the cosmic-ray gas 
to behave as an ideal relativistic gas with F 
~ 4/3. This makes the 
cr 
system more compressible, so that the overall compression 
across the 
precursor ÷ viscous subshock (if present) may 
exceed the value r = 
= (F. IV(F-I) = 4 (for F = 5/3) for a pure hydrodynamic 
shock. The 
value of the total compression 
depends 
sensitively on the efficiency 
of the acceleration process. 25'26 

35 
This non-linear modification of the shock structure will affect 
the 
momentum 
distribution 
of 
the 
accelerated 
particles. 
The 
mean-free-path 
~,.(y) increases 
with 
particle 
energy. 
High-energy 
particles diffuse further into the decelerating precursor flow and sample 
a larger effective compression across the shock, leading 
to a 
larger 
energy gain per cycle and a flattening of the distribution F(p) at higher 
energies. This breaks the scale-free power-law behaviour of Eqn. (60). 
The deviation from the simple power law becomes noticible if the velocity 
change Au = LCc~u/~x) across the precursor becomes of the same order as 
u. This defines a momentum scale ps in terms of the velocity gradient in 
the precursor and the momentum-dependent spatial diffusion coefficient 
D(p) as -- 
"" 
"lD(Ps)/U2)/c)u/c)x) 
To calculate this one must consider the full equation for the 
momentum distribution F(p,x,t) of the accelerated particles, integrating 
over momentum to get the particle pressure rI(x,t). In the simple case of 
elastic scattering centers advected with the fluid one has 27.32: 
c) FCp,x.t) 
• V'F-(p,x,t) 
~__(1 
pFfp.x,t)) 
(82a) 
where: 
Z(p,xlt) -= uF(p,x,t) - (D-V)F(p,x,t). 
(82b) 
The right-hand-side of (82a) shows the effect of expansion 
losses on the distribution as defined in Eqn. (39). The expression for the 
flux Z simply reflects the competition between dragging of energetic 
particles by the fluid with velocity u and diffusion with respect to the 
fluid. 
Results of numerical solutions of the full set of equations for 
the fluid and Eqns. (16) have confirmed this intuitive picture 28'29. When 
the total compression is large, the spectrum F(p) = ×p-S becomes quite 
flat at higher energies (s<2), Most of the particle pressure then resides at 
the high-energy tail of the distribution, depending quite sensitively on 
the momentum cut-off Prnax "~, YmaxmC. The problem 
then 
becomes 
time-dependent, since "(max (in absense of losses) depends on the age T 
of the shock, cf. Eqn. (70). For instance, for a scaling ),(Y) ~ RL/~ = R oy/E 
one 
has 
Ymax 
~ 
Eu T/cR . This 
means 
that 
shocks 
in 
which 
a 
significant fraction of t~e available° mechanical momentum flux gu 2 is 
converted into pressure of energetic particles are probably intrinsically 
time-dependent structures. 
3.10. Outstanding problems 
Although the basic principles of diffusive shock acceleration 
are well understood, there are still a number of unsolved problems in 
the theory which, at least in this authors view, stand 
in the way 
of a fully quantitative comparison of theory and observations. The most 
pressing of these problems are: 

36 
A. The injection problem. 
Most 
astrophysical 
shocks 
are 
collisionless 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
conversion 
of 
directed 
kinetic 
energy 
of 
the 
upstream 
flow 
into 
randomized motion ("heat") in the downstream flow proceeds through 
collective (plasma) effects rather than by ordinary Coulomb collisions, 
The 
typical 
random 
kinetic 
energy 
per 
proton 
downstream 
equals 
m u2/2 
. Shock 
acceleration 
takes 
a 
few 
of 
these 
particles, 
and 
p s 
accelerates them to energies much larger than this value. How many 
particles are picked up from the "thermal" 
pool at the shock to be 
accelerated further is not really known. 
This question 
is probably intimately 
connected 
with 
the 
detailed microscopic structure of quasi-parallel collisionless shocks in a 
magnetised plasma. The overall efficiency of the acceleration process can 
not 
really 
be calculated without 
some 
knowledge 
of this 
injection 
process. The momentum- and energy conservation laws for cosmic-ray 
mediated shocks (generalised Rankine-Hugoniot relations) in the steady 
state usually allow (at least) two solutions : one with low efficiency and 
a strong viscous subshock, and a high-efficiency solution with a weak 
subshock, or no viscous subshock at all 26.30. Which solution is chosen 
will depend on the injection process, unless enough seed particles are 
already present in the upstream flow to force the system into forming a 
cosmic-ray 
dominated 
shock 
One 
might 
hope 
that 
numerical 
simulations will answer this question. 
B. Electron acceleration . 
Non-thermal continuous radio emission is almost always interpreted as 
synchrotron 
radiation 
of 
relativistic 
electrons 
in 
a 
magnetic 
field. 
Relativistic protons remain invisible due to their small radiation losses. It 
is not known how much of the energy put into accelerated particles at 
a shock goes into protons and ions, and how much goes into electrons. 
This makes it very difficult to interpret the data in terms of the energy 
requirements needed to power the source. 
Electrons have to be accelerated to some threshold momentum 
before they can be picked up by the shock acceleration process. This 
threshold momentum usually exceeds the typical momentum -/Cmm )u 
e 
s 
of a thermalised electron in the post-shock flow. An important threshold 
is associated with the requirement of efficient scattering. Protons boiling 
of the shock generate low-frequency MHD waves . These waves have 
frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency g~ 
= eB/m c , and 
p 
wavenumbers 
below kma x ~ Dp/V A (V A 
~ B//(4~p) 
is thPe Alfven 
velocity ) . Electrons do not interact resonantly with these waves until 
their gyroradius R e ~ pc/eB > k-lxma ~ m VAC/eB. So in order to be 
scattered 
efficiently, 
the 
electron 
momentum 
must 
exceed 
a 
value 
p 
> m V.. 
Another 
possibility would 
be 
to 
employ 
other 
waves 
p 
(e.g. 
so-called 
Whistler 
waves) 
with 
shorter 
wavelengths 
to 
scatter 

37 
the electrons below the threshold momentum. This aspect of the theory 
is as yet not fully explored. 
A 
further 
problem 
with 
electron 
acceleration 
in 
Active 
Galactic Nuclei or Quasars is that the radiation fields in the nuclei of 
these objects are very intense. This means that radiation losses (Compton 
losses) are strong, and shock acceleration may not be efficient enough to 
overcome these losses. Another source of relativistic electrons therefore 
seems likely, such as a pair cascade induced by decay of pions into 
"r-rays. The pions are generated by proton-proton/proton-photon collisions 
of shock-accelerated protons, for which radiation losses do not become 
very important . Usually the losses due to photon-proton collisions have 
already terminated the spectrum of protons accelerated at the shock. 
Such models have been proposed in various incarnations 33-35 
3.11 
Relativistic shocks 
I now briefly consider the case of relativistic shocks. From 
Eqn. (53) one sees that the energy jump per cycle can become quite 
large 
if 
the 
velocity 
jump 
Au 
across 
the 
shock 
seen 
from 
the 
downstream rest frame becomes large in the sense that Au ~ c. For very 
strong shocks in a relativistic gas (equation of state P = ~/3, with ~ the 
energy density) one can derive a relation uu 
= c/3 . For u 
= u 
~ c 
one has u 
~ c/3. This gives a value of z~u ,~ c (see gqn. 49) s. The 
energy of a relativistic particle (g. ~ pc ) in the downstream rest frame 
changes in a cycle according to: 
E/ 
~ 
P_X_/ 
_ 
1 + #i 
Ei 
Pi 
1 ÷ ~,. 
(83) 
Here I have assumed v 
~ c and defined # : cos@ with @ the angle 
between the particle velocity and the shock normal, This energy gain 
can be very 
large if #f ~ -1. One can derive 
the spectrum 
of the 
accelerated 
particles 
by 
a simple 
argument 
if one assumes 
that 
the 
downstream distribution function is kept isotropic by frequent scattering. 
Since the escape probability and the momentum gain are independent of 
momentum for very relativistic particles (v = c = constant) there is no 
intrinsic momentum scale in the problem. The spectrum must therefore 
be a power-law in momentum, which is scale-free. In the downstream 
rest-frame 
the 
microscopic 
distribution 
function 
(defined 
by 
dN 
= 
= f(x.t.p)d3p with dN the number density of particles in a momentum-volume 
d3p around p) a little bit downstream of the shock (x = x" 
-= x * 8 . 
with E --> O) is:

(84) 

38 
The distribution function f(x,p,t) is a Lorentz invariant. Since we treat 
the shock as a discontinuity, it is impossible to "hide" or "store" particles 
in the shock. Thai means the distribution function must be continuous 
across the shock. First of all I express the downstream momentum 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
corresponding 
momentum 
measured 
in 
the 
upstream 
rest-frame K. Using E ~ 
pc 
and the fact that 
the relative velocity 
between 
K- 
and 
K 
= 
- 
Au 
one 
immediately 
finds 
from 
the 
Lorentz transformation of energy, defining [3 = Au/c and F = (1 - [32)-1/2: 
p. = Fp_(l - [31-t_) . 
(85) 
The invariance of f(x,p,t) together with the continuity of f across the 
shock then immediately gives the distribution just in front of the shock 
in the upstream rest-frame, defining x- = x 
- s with s --> O: 
s 
s 
f_(x$,p_) ; f.(x~,p.) = xp. -q = xF-qp-q(l_ . [3~_)-q. 
(86) 
Note that if [3 .~ 1 ( u 
~ c ), the distribution f 
is very sharply peaked 
s 
towards the direction ~ = -1 pointing away 
from the shock. This is an 
example of relativistic ~eaming: seen from the upstream rest-frame, the 
downstream distribution is sharply peaked even though it is isotropic in 
the downstream rest-frame. 
The slope q can be determined as follows: in the steady state 
the flux S(x,p) of particles at a given momentum must satisfy V.S = O. 
If all quantities only depend on the coordinate x along the shock normal 
this reduces to C)Sx(x,p)/c)x = 0 . This implies: 
*1 
S-(x) 
= fdp 
(cp 
÷ us)f (x,p ,p ) = constant.

The term c~ 
• u 
is just the relative velocity hv 
between the shock 
- 
S

and the particle in frame K 
. If no particles are incident far ahead of 
the shock so that all accelerated particles are injected at the shock front 
one must have S- -- O. Substituting Eqn. (86) yields an implicit integral 
x 
equation for q. Defining [5 s - uJc: 
*1 
f dr/_( ~'~÷ [3s)(1 ÷ ~_)-q 
= O. 
(88)

For [3 and 13 s << l one can expand (1 * [3~_) -q ,~ 1 -q~_÷ 
0([32) and 
evaluate 
the integral. This yields, using Eqn. (49) in the form

As can be seen from definition (84) this is completely equivalent to our 
result (60) which 
was derived 
in a quite different manner 
using a 
statistical argument. So this procedure reproduces the correct slope of the

In the relativistic case one has to perform the full integration. 
The resulting expression can be written [assuming q > 2):

which turns out to be a good ap_Plroximafion. The equation then becomes, 
neglecting the (1 - [D q-2, (1 - ~)q- 
terms:

one finds after some straightforward algebra:

For those shocks in extremely relativistic fluids which satisfy u u 
one has r : 362 and this equation reduces to:

[95] 
q = I * 
3[32 _ 
l 
This expression is valid for [3 s > 1/-/3 ~ 0.57 (r > 1). The upstream sound 
speed in this case equals c-/[c)P/c)E) = c/-/3, so this condition corresponds 
to the usual condition of supersonic flow in the upstream region. 
This analytical formula correctly reproduces numerical results 
of Kirk and Schneider 36. For ~s ~ 0.8 they find q .~ 5.6 , whereas Eqn. 
[94) gives q : 5.69. For {5--> 1 we both find q 
~ 4. This last case 
_2 s 
corresponds to F(p) oe p 
, c.f. Eqn.(90]. A more precise calculation in 
this case 
has 
to 
take 
account 
of the 
fact 
that 
relativistic 
beaming 
becomes so strong that the downstream distribution becomes anisotropic. 
One then finds a somewhat steeper slope: q ~ 4.2. So strangely enough, 
although the physics is rather different, a strong relativistic shock with 

40 
~s ~ 1 and compression ratio r = 3 produces a particle spectrum with 
almost the same slope as a ordinary non-relativistic hydrodynamical 
shock with compression ratio 4, the maximum compression allowed for a 
shock in an ideal monoatomic fluid. 
3.12 
Shock-drift acceleration 
There is an acceleration mechanism associated with oblique 
shocks (magnetic field not along the shock normal) which does not 
rely on repeated scattering across the shock. This mechanism is called 
shock drift acceleration 37'3a. Consider a shock propagating along the 
x-axis with velocity V 
= U , with the plane shock front in the y-z plane, 
X- 
S 
and the magnetic field in the x-z plane. Let the shock compression ratio 
equal r -- p./p ; V 
/V 
, and the angle between the shock normal (x-axis) 
- 
x- 
x* 
and the magnetic field be given by 4 
and 4 
upstream and downstream 
respectively. In a frame where the shock is stationary at x = O (the shock 
frame), there is an electric field along the shock front which is induced 
by the bulk plasma motion: E = - (V x B )/c = (V B /c )e . The boundary- 
x 
z 
y 
. 
conditions at the shock are the continuity of the normal magnehc field B 
x 
and the tangential electric field E 
= V B/c across the shock. This leads to: 
y 
x 
~' 
B.cos4. = B_cos4_ ; 
B sin4. = rB_sin4_. 
(96) 
This jump in the tangential component of the magnetic field is important. 
If one considers particles with a gyro-radius R L larger than the shock 
thickness, the jump in the magnetic field strength for 4_ ~ 0 has an important 
consequence. If a particle crosses the shock from upstream to downstream, 
it suddenly finds itself in a region with a stronger magnetic field. Its 
gyro-radius R L = pc/IZieB becomes smaller. For some particles, this leads 
to an orbit, which allows them to cross the shock again into the upstream 
region: in some sense they have been reflected by the shock (or rather. 
the discontinuity in the magnetic field created by the shock). This reflection 
is most easily described in the so-called de Hoffmann-Teller frame (dHTF) 
where the induced electric field vanishes. This frame moves with respect 
to the shock frame with a velocity VclHT F along the shock, given by: 
EdHTF -- E + (VdHTF x B ) -- 0 , 
(9D 
<--> 
VdFIT F = 
(Vxtan4)_e 
z = (V×tan4).e z. 
In this frame, the plasma velocity V and the magnetic field B are parallel 
on both sides of the shock. This transformation only exists if VdHTF < C , 
SO tan4 < c/V 
-- c/U. Shocks which satisfy this requirement are called 
- 
x- 
sub-luminal. In the dH~F there is no electric field, so the energy of a 

41 
particle is conserved (magnetic component of the Lorentz force does no work). 
In this frame the reflection by the shock is elastic. However, when one 
transforms back to the shock-frame , there is an energy change given by 
the direct analogue of Eqn, (51): 
F.f 
(C2 + VdHTFVzi) 
In order to calculate this change, one has to follow the detailed particle 
-orbits to find (a) which particles are reflected, and (b) the value of Vz~. 
given the initial conditions, among them v . . It turns out that most 
zl 
particles are either transmitted by the shock, or reflected only once. 
For shocks with VdHTF << C it turns out that -on average- the 
particles traverse the shock conserving their so-called magnetic moment 
o¢ sin2~'/B in the dHTF. Here 3 -as before- is the pitch-angle between the 
momentum vector and the magnetic field. Particles are reflected provided 
> 3 
with sin-3 
= ~(B/B) , all evaluated in the dHTF. Those particles 
C

÷ 
which have a velocity along the field of order v H .~ VdHTF sO' that they 
have a small velocity with respect to the shock can gain a significant 
amount of energy 39". This is especially true for nearly-luminal 
shocks 
with VdHTF ~ C . On the other hand, in order not to be transmitted 
by the shock the initial particle velocity must be of order v ~ VdHTF, 
which for nearly-luminal shocks means that they have to be relativistic 
already. 
3.13 Conclusions 
The theory of diffusive shock acceleration has firmly established itself in 
the 
astrophysical 
community 
as 
an 
important 
mechanism 
for 
the 
generation of energetic particles. In its simplest form, it is deceivingly 
straightforward. Practical application to astrophysical objects however is 
hindered by the fact that some of the details of the process such as 
injection, and the acceleration of electrons remain ill-understood, It seems 
therefore premature to use the proces as a panacea whenever efficient 
generation of energetic particles is required by the observations. Some of 
these problems are closely linked to our lack of understanding of all the 
details of quasi-parallel shock structure in astrophysical environments.

Abstract: The current status of theories of the interstellar medium as well as 
of supernova remnants is reviewed. Some shortcomings and the importance of 
including magnetic fields and cosmic rays are discussed in detail and at the end 
this additional physical input is compared to observations in the X- and "/-range. 
Introduction 
There is much evidence both from observational facts as well as from theo- 
retical grounds that large fractions of the interstellar medium (ISM) are con- 
trolled by energetic phenomena like supernova explosions and stellar winds 
from young OB-associations. Therefore and in accordance with the title of 
this fourth European Astrophysical Doctoral Network (EADN)-school I will 
mainly concentrate on the high energy aspect s of the interstellar medium 
and in the second part discuss the evolution of supernova remnants in more 
detail. In doing so I want to show that within the framework of present ISM 
theories which do not incorporate the various essentially non-linear interac- 
tions of cosmic rays and magnetic fields into a global description of the ISM, 
several observational aspects cannot be covered. Up to now it seems to be 
unclear whether a simple modification of the existing ISM theories (e.g. by 
fixing parameters) or whether the inclusion of new physical phenomena is 
needed to obtain a more consistent picture of the overall properties of the 
ISM. Keeping in mind the richness of the mutual interactions I tend to the 
opinion that all existing ISM theories can be regarded only as guidelines and 
are deficient by not taking into account the non-linear interactions of cosmic 
rays and magnetic fields. However, being faraway from giving a consistent 
theory of the ISM I also focus at different chapters of these lectures on the 

44 
basic modifications caused by cosmic rays and magnetic fields. Starting from 
a simple analytical description of the SNR evolution (in spherical symme- 
try) the last two paragraphs describe some observational consequences at 
higher energies (X- and 7-rays) and theoretical X- and "/-ray luminosities 
are calculated for a SNR evolution including the non-linear modification by 
particle acceleration in shock waves. 
In dealing with the overall properties of the ISM I will briefly consider 
the effects of superbubbles and galactic winds. Superbubbles or supershell 
as observed in HI are likely to evolve to scale heights which cannot be solely 
related to the galactic disk but can provide a 'vent' to the galactic halo. In 
this context the ISM is not a 'closed system' and has various connections to 
the sourrounding galactic halo. Again I want to point out the importance 
of cosmic rays for these processes. I am encouraged by the fact that in the 
year 1912 Victor Hess discovered the so-called HShenstrahlung (nowadays 
cosmic rays) during several balloon flights in Graz, the city where this year's 
EADN-school takes place. 
1 Theories of the Interstellar Medium 
This chapter reviews some present theories of the interstellar medium. Start- 
ing with the two-phase model based on equilibrium cooling the major short- 
comings are discussed leading to a model of the 'violent' interstellar medium 
where a third hot phase is controlled by supernova explosions (see e.g. the 
recent review by Spitzer 1990). Some consequences and predictions of the 
three-phase model are explained and contrasted to observations. The influ- 
ence of cosmic rays on several processes is emphasized which may lead to 
a better agreement with the observational facts if the nonlinear modifica- 
tions of shock acceleration are taken into account. At the end more recent 
developments on the so-called disk-halo connection and on galactic winds 
are presented. 
1.1 Constituents of the ISM 
To develop a 'theory' of the interstellar medium it is essential to introduce 
briefly the main constituents and summarize their properties and various 
interactions. However, in this short overview I have to ignore some properties 
of the interstellar medium like changes in the chemical abundances or a 
more detailed discussion of interstellar clouds. The main emphasis lies on 
several high energy aspects and in dealing with the diversity and frequency 
of the energizing phenomena it becomes clear that almost all interstellar 
material is overrun several times by (weak) shock waves. Turbulent as well 
as systematic motions like rotation are observed on quite different scales. 
Therefore a static decription cannot be used to model this environment, 

45 
however it may be possible to reach a steady state situation or at least a 
slowly evolving medium. 
Beside the energies contained in turbulent or ordered motions basically 
four components and their 'lively' interactions have to be included in a 
consistent description of the ISM. 
a) Interstellar plasmas. They consist of electrons, ions, neutrals and 
dust particles with ranges in temperature and density of about 
10~ 
T/[K] 
~ l0 s 
10_3 ~p/[gcm_3 ] £ 107 
(1) 
where the low temperature and high density values are typical for the 
dense cold cores of molecular clouds (see also Table 1). On the other 
hand the high temperatures and low densities correspond to the interi- 
ors of SNR's. The mass fraction of dust md to gas mg will be taken to 
be roughly md/rng ~-- 0.01. 
b) Radiation fields. The radiation field in the ISM displays large in- 
tensity variations ranging from the 2.7 K background radiation up to 
the very high energy 7-rays produced by inverse Compton scattering or 
neutral pion decay. The matter is either exposed to the radiation field 
or the photons are generated themselves in the ISM. 
c) Cosmic rays. These high energy particles are in almost all cases 
charged and well above the thermal energies of the background plasma 
with the main energy contribution coming from GeV-particles. The cos- 
mic rays are closely linked to the magnetic field and at rare occasions 
single particles are observed carting energies of up to 1021eV/nuc. 
d) Magnetic fields. From observations it is obvious that a large scale 
ordered (L ~ 1 kpc) as well as smaller scale (1 ~ L ~ 100 pc) 'turbulent' 
magnetic fields exist. However, the orientation of these fields depends 
on the observing direction but a clear tendency of field lines aligned 
with the spiral arms can be inferred from the data. 
An important observational fact concerning these constituents of the 
ISM is shown by their energy densities (including also turbulence and or- 
dered motions) (e.g. Axford 1981a) 
Uth ~'~ 
Umag ~'~ ~rad ~ 
UCR r,~ Utur b ~,~ Ukin 
_'2 1 eV cm -3 = 1.6 10-12nerg cm -3 
(2) 
which are all of the same order of magnitude. Comparing these almost equal 
energy densities contained in the different components the ISM seems to 
have reached a certain equipartition. The large number of processes involved 
makes such a conclusion plausible although a detailed balance is a priori not 
clear. Figure 1 summarizes some (not all) processes interchanging energies 
between various components as well as some observational consequences.

For simplicity reasons I do not distinguish between molecular and dif- 
fuse clouds (cf. Table 1). The interactions with dust particles as well as the 
formation of dust grains are neglected although these 'heavy' particles may 
have a significant influence on dynamical interstellar processes (like dust 
driven stellar winds, ambipolar diffusion inside dense clouds, depletion of 
metals on grain surfaces, formation of H2-molecules, etc.). The cloud chem- 
istry and shock chemistry are not considered in this article and therefore 
I will assume the plasmas to be chemically homogeneous throughout the 
following sections. 
1.2 Interstellar plasmas 
The interstellar plasmas cover a broad range in density and temperature 
(cf. Sect. 1.1) and consist of electrons, neutrals, ions and dust particles. 
The plasma is assumed to be at least quasineutral but in most applica- 
tions I will use a magnetohydrodynamical approximation which does not 
distinguish between the different species. During the following sections I 
will assume pressure equilibrium which is plausible because no large scale 
motions driven by pressure gradients are observed on gMactic scales. The 
existence of different phases at pressure equilibrium is possible only in the 
case of complex thermodynamics and is given by a detailed balance between 
heating and cooling mechanisms. 
1.2.1 Two-Phase-Model 
This description of the ISM is based on the work of Field, Goldsmith and 
Habing (1969) which starts with a equilibrium configuration, i.e. a balance 
between cooling £: and heating ~ with a density p and a temperature T. 
Since the plasma is assumed to be optically thin no radiation transport is 
necessary and we get the simple relation 
/:(p, T) = G(P, T). 
(3) 
More useful in the subsequent considerations the net effect is given by 
L(p, T) = £(p, T) -- g(p, T). 
(4) 
Following Field's (1965) ideas such a configuration is unstable if distur- 
bances exist that can decrease the entropy S of the system which is written 
like 
where X denotes a thermodynaanical quantity. Assuming a perfect gas and 
an isobaric perturbation Equation (5) yields 

48 
=

< 
0. 
(6) 
At this point a more detailed discussion of individual heating and cooling 
processes is needed.

Cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the denser interiors 
of clouds and even energetic particles with a few tens of MeV/nuc can 
penetrate dense clouds (Cesarsky & VSlk 1978) because they are not hin- 
dered by diffusion. Such diffusion would be caused by resonant small scale 
MHD-waves which are strongly damped in a weakly ionized medium due 
to ion-neutral friction (Kulsrud & Pearce 1969). The ionization rate by 
cosmic rays ~CR is measured by the abundance of certain molecules and 
typical values of ~CR are within the range of 10 -17 S -1 up to 10 -15 S -1. 
A mean value of 10 -16 s -1 is in agreement with UV-measurements of the 
[HD/H2]-ratio (Barsuhn & Wamsley 1977). From the [DCO+/HCO+]-ratio 
Guelin et al. (1982) derive a value of ~CR = 3.5 10 -16 s -1. The heating 
rate corresponding to this cosmic ray ionization rate depends now on many 
following secondary processes as well as on the degree of ionization and 

49 
chemical composition where the ionized particles and electrons lose their 
energy. Nevertheless in this case of general considerations the mean heating 
by cosmic rays in an atomic cloud of low ionization is around eh ~ 6 eV per 
primary ionization and the total heating rate for a hydrogen density nH can 
be written according to Dalgarno & McCray (1972) 
\ 10-- / nH erg cm-Js 
(7) 
Other heating mechanisms operate in the ISM like heating by starlight, 
soft X-rays, photoelectrons from grains, collisions of dust grains (heated by 
the near-infrared radiation field, cf. Sect. 1.3) with molecules. Beside these 
direct heating mechanisms the ISM is also heated in collective hydrodynam- 
icai processes due to the compression by stellar winds , shocks, SNRs, MHD- 
waves and dissipation of turbulence. Just to quantify one other mechanism, 
heating by photoelectrons from dust grains is considered where de Jong et 
al. (1980) find 
6g~ ~- 410 -2s rt H erg cm-Js -1 . 
(8) 
These two examples show that the basic form of the direct heating mech- 
anisms can be stated like 
6 = na 
n 
(9) 
where G is the sum of all relevant heating contributions. 
The cooling of a tenuous plasma proceeds through the conversion of 
kinetic energy into radiation by various processes and for cooling to be ef- 
ficient the plasma has to be optically thin towards the produced photons. 
Cooling clearly depends on the chemical composition and the degree of 
ionization. Line cooling and recombination radiation are the most impor- 
tant cooling mechanisms at temperatures T < 107. At higher temperatures 
bremsstrahlung dominates the energy loss of a hot plasma, i.e. the cooling 
rate c< T 1/2. All effects together are building the so-called cooling function 
A(T) defined through 
f~ = n2A(T). 
(1O) 
Detailed calculations on the ionization structure and emission properties of a 
hot optically thin plasma have been carried out by Raymond & Smith (1977) 
where more information can be found also on the radiative mechanisms, 
on the ionization and recombinations rates as well as on the collisional 
cross sections. A similar cooling function is displayed in Fig. 2 where the 
main contributions of different chemical elements to radiative cooling are 
indicated by the corresponding chemical symbols. Note again that these 
relative cooling contributions depend on the chemical composition of the 
hot plasma (e.g. BShringer & Hensler 1989). For many applications I will 
adopt Kahn's approximation of the cooling function in the range between 
2 105 < T/[K] < 107 (Kahn 1976) which can be stated as a simple power 
law of the temperature 

50 
A(T) = 1.3 10-19T -1/2 erg cm3s -1 
(11) 
shown in Fig. 2by the dashed straight line. The exact numerical value 
of Eq. (11) changes with different authors and is meant only as an order 
of magnitude estimate. In the high temperature range (T > 2 107K) the 
plasma is totally ionized and can therefore radiate only through free-free 
transitions (i.e. bremsstrahlung) leading to a cooling law of A(T) o¢ T 1/2. 
Collecting the expressions for heating (9) and cooling (10) the equilib- 
rium condition (3) as well as pressure equilibrium are given by 
L = n2A(T) - n G 
and 
n T = conat. 
(12) 
or put in a more suitable form

Applying Eqs. (12) the instability criterium (5) reads now

(14) 
In summary this instability will occur in regimes where the cooling func- 
tion A(T) rises moderately with temperature, i.e. 
alnA 
CO 
ln----T < 1. 
(15) 
The equilibrium situation can be further analysed if A(T)/T is plotted 
versus T as done in Fig. 3. The depicted curve marks all possible equilib- 
rium states for a given cooling law A(T). Above this curve we have a net 
heating of the medium and below a net cooling. Fixing a certain heating 
rate (i.e. a certain value of G in Eq. (9) which depends on the local con- 
ditions of the ISM) a horizontal line can intersect at most at four values 
our equilibrium curve determining the possible equilibrium states. It is also 
clear that only a limited zone of heating rates is permitted to generate a 
multi-phase ISM indicated by the two horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 3 and 
called 'multi-phase-zone'. Each of these intersections gives rise to a 'phase' 
of the ISM which could be thermally stable or could last long enough to 
be observed. However, only two of these phases are stable according to the 
stability criterium of Eq. (15) because the other two intersections exhibit

Fig. 3. Equilibrium states of the two-phase model based on a constant heating 
rate and on constant pressure as a function of temperature 
negative slopes at the A(T) curve. The equilibrium values at the low tem- 
perature and high density around T -~ 100 K and n ~_ 10 cm -3 are called 
'clouds' whereas the values of T ~- 104K and n -~ 10 -1 cm -3 characterize 
the so-called 'intercloud medium'. Note that this discussion is based on the 
assumption of pressure equilibrium between the two phases. 
Within the framework of the two-phase model some observational facts 
cannot be explained. The thermal gas is unstable at high temperatures but 
several X-ray observations (e.g. McCammon L: Sanders 1990) indicate large 
portions of hot plasmas. To maintain a hot medium either an additional 
heating mechanism is needed (like dissipation of turbulent motions or damp- 
ing of Alfv6n waves) or the ISM is far from an equilibrium state. In the latter 
case the cooling time tc must be large compared to the typical evolution time 
scale of the ISM. The two-phase model predicts a warm partially ionized 
medium around a temperature of T -~ 104K which is not observed in this 
manner. The estimated mean electron density (he/ in this warm medium 
disagrees with dispersion measurements of pulsar signals (cf. Sect. 1.5.1) 
which gives the mean electron density integrated along the line of sight. 
The interstellar OVI absorption lines make the presence of a widespread 

52 
hot gas very likely (Jenkins & Meloy 1974). At first these lines have been 
attributed to this warm medium but nowadays it is clear that these lines 
are due to the conductive interfaces between cold clouds and gas at X-ray 
emitting temperatures. The conductive energy transport is mainly provided 
by the motions of electrons and therefore depends on the orientation of the 
magnetic field in the interface region which connects the magnetic field to 
other properties of the ISM. However, the local nature of this process makes 
an estimate of the overall influence very difficult.

1.2.2 
Three-Phase-Model 
Beginning with the work of Cox ~ Smith (1974) the so-called three-phase 
model of the ISM has been developed by McKee & Ostriker (1977) which 
introduces a third hot phase controlled by supernova explosions and stellar 
winds from young OB-associations. Depending on several parameters the 
supernova remnants (SNR's) can overlap and the hot and tenuous interiors 
of the SNR's can only cool slowly forming the third hot phase. Note that this 
model does not refer to an equilibrium situation but is better characterized 
by a so-called 'violent' ISM. Since SNe are responsible for the main source 
of hot gas in our Galaxy a quantitative theory of SNR evolution is essential 
for an accurate description of the hot interstellar plasmas. 
This particular model suggests that the thermal plasma is distributed 
among four phases, a) Most of the galactic volume is filled with the hot 
low-density ionized gas of old SNRs called HIM whose parameters are given 
in Table 2. b) Embedded in that hot phase is a large number of cold neutral 
and relatively dense clouds (CNM) containing most of the mass and having 
a small filling factor, c) Each of these clouds is surrounded by a warm 
envelope occupying large volumes with small masses. For simplicity reasons 

53 
these envelopes consist of the warm neutral medium (WNM) where the 
low degree of ionization is maintained by the very soft X-rays emitted from 
SNRs. d) Further out the envelopes of the clouds show the warm but ionized 
medium (WIM) whose ionization balance is controlled by the UV photons 
from hot stars (OB, white dwarfs, planetary nebulae) and by conduction 
from the hot phase. 
The values for the HIM,CNM, WIM, WNM are now calculated under 
the assumption of pressure equilibrium and various interchange processes 
(evaporation, fragmentation and condensation of clouds, thermal instabil- 
ities, shock waves) also mentioned in the overview (Fig. 1). The result of 
such a balance (McKee & Ostriker 1977) is summarized in Table 2 and the 
work of Ikeuchi et al. (1984) illuminates in more detail the possible states 
and the time-dependence of the ISM including the role of star formation, 
cloud-cloud collisions as well as of gravitational instabilities occurring in 
cloud complexes. 
Since the fraction of ionization in the WIM and WNM is largely deter- 
mined by the interstellar radiation field (cf. Sect. 1.3) we see again a vital 
interaction between the various constituents of the ISM. Note that the vol- 
ume filling factor of the cloud envelopes (WNM+WIM) covers more than 
30% of the total galactic space.

To develop the theory of the third hot phase a few estimates concern- 
ing the SNR evolution have to be supplied. It is convenient to define the 
dimensionless 'porosity' parameter 
Q = rsN VSNR rSNR 
(16) 
where rSN is the SN-rate per unit time and volume, VSNR denotes the final 
SNR volume and rSNtt the mean SNR lifetime. The SN-rate per galaxy r as 
well as the mean SNR lifetime can be written as 
r 
RSNR 
rSN -- AdiskHSNR'

and AdiskHsNR defines the galactic volume available for SNR's, i.e. the disk 
area Adisk ~ r(15kpc) 2 times the typical scale height of stars HSNR --~ 
+100pc able to evolve into a SN. The mean SNR lifetime is given by the 
final SNR radius RSNR divided by the mean velocity in the ISM ~ISM. If 
the porosity parameter Q remains constant over several SNR lifetimes TSN R 
there is a simple relation to the volume filling factor 
Q 
f -- 1 +----Q' 
Q < 1. 
(18) 
To get further insight into the three-phase model estimates for the values 
of RSNR, VSNR and TSNR are needed.

The quantity E51 denotes the SN-explosion energy in units of 1051erg and 
no the number density of the external medium in cm -3. Assuming that the 
further evolution is characterized by a pressure modified 'snowplow' solution 
(cf. Sect. 2.3) we get 
Rcx t 2/7, 
i~ = v c< t -5/7. 
(20) 
The constants of proportionality have to be fixed at t = tsh¢ll by R = -Rshell 
and v = Vshen. Therefore the velocity scales like 
v = Vshen 
(21) 
which can be solved for the time t = TSN R where the expansion velocity 
of the remnant has decreased to some mean velocity in the ISM, i.e. v = 
~ISM = 20kms -1. This velocity can be obtained from the typical Alfv~n 
velocity VA (27) if a mean magnetic field of B = 5 # G and a mean density 
of n = 0.3 cm -3 is assumed. 
This results in an estimate of the final SNR-radius and the final SNR-age

where Moo stands for the number of SN-explosions per century distributed 
randomly over the galactic disk. This value of Q = 0.098 implies a filling 
factor (18) of f = 0.089. 
Applying this 3-phase model to the ISM leads to several correct pre- 
dictions concerning e.g. the mean interstellar pressure of about nT 
~_ 
3700cm-SK or the mean electron density of (ne) ~ 0.04cm -3 in the 
WIM cloud envelopes with a typical dispersion of (n~ 2) 22_ 0.08 cm -s which 
is in agreement with dispersion measurements based on pulsar signals 
(cf. Sect. 1.5.1). The expanding SNRs overrun many clouds and can ac- 
celerate them. The energy balance maintained by this input and the losses 
due to inelastic cloud collision can be used to calculate the mean veloc- 
ity dispersion of interstellar clouds of (vd> -- 8 km s -1 (McKee ~z Ostriker 
1977), a value in agreement with the observations (e.g. Jenkins 1978ab). 
However, a shock passing a cloud leads to the development of several in- 
stabilities on the surface (Woodward 1976) which makes the simple picture 
of almost spherical clouds being accelerated rather doubtful. But due to 
the complicated cloud shapes, the essentially non-spherical geometry, their 
formation and evolution the actual value of fCNM is very difficult to esti- 
mate. Within the frame of the 3-phase model the X-ray intensity of the local 
bubble can also be explained (see e.g. the review by Cox & Reynolds 1987) 
which describes the local ISM within a radius of 100 pc having a typical 
temperature of 106K and a density of 510-Jcm -3. 
Some observational facts cannot be modelled by the 3-phase model in its 
present versions. The HI-distribution in our galaxy is rather smooth as in- 
ferred from Lya and 21cm observations which leads to an increase of the fill- 
ing factor fCNM of the cold neutral medium (Lockmma et al. 1986). Concern- 
ing other uncertainties due to geometry and structure of clouds (e.g. more 
sheet-like than spherical) it is unclear whether some disagreement with the 
observations can be avoided by introducing more realistic cloud models. The 
HI-data of Heiles (1987) go along the same direction which favour a rather 
smooth distribution of the neutral gas in our Galaxy. These observations 
at 21cm show that a substantial fraction up to 40% of HI is warm whereas 
only about 2% are predicted by the current 3-phase model. These observa- 
tions suggest two different HI components. On the other hand these data 
reveal the existence of much larger structures (L _~ 1 kpc) in HI pointing 
again to a connection with the galactic halo; they are called supersheUs, 
worms or chimneys (cf. Sect. 1.6.1). Hence the SNR cavities appear to fill 
much smaller volumes than predicted by the standard 3-phase model which 
neglects the so-called disk-halo connection including the formation of su- 
perbubbles and galactic fountains and providing a 'vent' for the galactic 
interstellar medium. As concluded by Heiles (1991) the interpretation of 
the HI-data and the corresponding filling factors depends also on the topo- 
logical structure of the ISM and it may be that the interstellar HI covers 
the galactic plane like a bedsheet covers a bed but does not occupy much 

56 
volume, i.e. HI may have a large 2-dimensional filling factor bug a very small 
3-dimensional volume filling factor. 
At this point I want to mention that all these arguments do not include 
the influence of cosmic ray acceleration in the SNR evolution although the 
production of energetic particles can strongly modify the expansion by non- 
linear effects in shock waves (cf. Sect. 2.5). The observed properties of cosmic 
rays indicate that the volume factor fHIM of the hot phase is also constrained 
due to a mean density of about fi _~ 0.1 cm -3 assuming a path lenght 
('grammage') of X ~ 5gem -3 (cf. Sect. 1.4 and Cesarsky (1980) for the 
transport and confinement of cosmic rays within our Galaxy). However, the 
uncertainties of these estimates do not permit an actual value for fHIM but 
favour not too small numbers. The mentioned OVI-observations require a 
high value of fnIM to explain the almost ubiquitous presence of hot gas. 
A possible way to join these different observational facts is to consider the 
ISM not as a closed system but to include the galactic halo as an additional 
energy sink (cf. Sect. 1.6). 
The SNe are not uniformly distributed over the galactic disk. The regions 
with galactocentric radii of R ~ 3kpc are dominated by old Type II SNe 
whereas the Type I SNe are rather concentrated in OB-associations within 
4 ~ R ~ 7 kpc and at R ~ 7kpc both types are common. Therefore we 
expect less overlapping SNRs decreasing the porosity parameter as defined 
by eq. (16) to Q << 1. 
1.3 Radiation fields 
At the location of the sun within our galaxy (R '~ 
_ 10 kpc) a diffuse inter- 
stellar radiation field is observed where a comparable energy flux exists at 
several frequency ranges shown in Fig. 4 extending from microwaves up to 
7-rays. A large number of properties of this background radiation can be 
found in the IAU Symposium No. 139 edited by Bowyer & Leinert (1989). 
At this point I intend to show only the general behaviour of the radiation 
field and point out that the errors in the fluxes of Fig. 4 can differ from 
one frequency range to another resulting from rather different observational 
techniques with different intrinsic accuracies. 
Starting at the lower end of frequencies we can infer the black body radi- 
ation at a temperature T = 2.7 K followed by the very pronounced radiation 
peak in the infrared (A _~ 1 #m, log tJ _~ 14.5) produced by the large number 
of cool stars. Accordingly, it is not possible to talk about the interstellar 
radiation field without mentioning the importance of dust particles which 
obscure all regions at visual and UV wavelengths. The absorbed photons 
heat the dust grains leading to a far-infrared emission which provides a 
major part (~ 30%) of the total luminosity of the Galaxy (cf. also Fig. 4). 
Several more aspects of dust emission and absorption like extinction laws, 
scattering and polarization of star light can be found e.g. in a recent re- 
view by Mathis (1990). Apart from the dominance of dust emission in the 

57 
range around 100 #m dust particles play a vital role also for the chemistry 
in interstellar clouds, in particular through ~e formation of H2 or through 
cooling and heating by photoelectrons from grain surfaces and I refer e.g. to 
the IAU Symposium 135 'Interstellar dust' edited by Tielens • Allamandola 
(1989) where much more information is collected concerning the different 
aspects of interstellar dust particles.

Fig. 4. The interstellar radiation field in the vicinity of the sun as a function of 
frequency 
The values between )~ = lmm, logv = 11.5 and A = 910/~, logv = 15.5 
have been taken from the model of Mathis et al. (1983) where contributions 
from four stellar components distributed differently throughout the galaxy 
are included. However, IRAS observations at A = 12 #m and )~ = 25 #m 
show significantly higher fluxes which can be explained by emission from 
small dust grains or very small PAH grains which are not considered in the 
model (e.g. Mezger 1990). 
The Lyman-a-edge located at 13.6 eV or log v = 15.517 is clearly visible 
through a drop of the radiative energy density by more than two orders 
of magnitude. The EUV flux data in the solar vicinity are taken from the 

58 
collection of Reynolds (1990). A theoretical modelling of the diffuse interstel- 
lar radiation field around the Lya-edge has been done by Weyman (1967). 
These numbers are strongly dependent on the hydrogen column density and 
on the position within the Galaxy. The ionizing flux in the galactic halo can 
be much higher due to less absorbing hydrogen. In this sense the values 
given in Fig. 4 can be upper as well as lower limits to the actual UV-flux at 
a certain location in the Galaxy. Together with the X-ray flux penetrating 
deeper into dense clouds the UV-flux is responsible for the amount of the 
warm and partly ionized medium (WIM or WNM) as seen in Sect. 1.2.2. 
Studies of the photoionization in the halo of the Galaxy can give an upper 
limit for the amount of ionizing radiation in this highly obscured energy 
range (Bregman L: Harrington 1986). According to these authors the range 
between 13.6 eV and 45 eV is dominated by light of young OB-stars, between 
45 eV and 2 keV planetary nebulae provide their major contribution whereas 
the extragalactic X-ray background becomes prominent at the higher pho- 
ton energies. However, the ionizing flux of OB-stars is the most important 
contributor to the ionizing radiation field provided that the stopping length 
of the photons is greater than a few parsecs. Observations of diffuse X-rays 
and ionized atoms suggest that the filling factor of the hot and tenuous gas 
is not too small (cf. Sect.l.2.2) resulting also in a low absorption probability. 
For this purpose it is enough to approximate the huge number of X- 
ray observations by simple fits showing the general trend. The compilation 
of X-ray data in the range from lkeV or logu = 17.4 up to 100keV or 
log u = 19.4 due to Schwartz & Gursky (1974) has been used where the 
differential X-ray intensity is represented by two power laws with spectral 
indices of -0.40 vs. -1.38 joined together at 21keV or log u = 18.7. Note 
that this sharp break in the slopes has no physical significance. The spectral 
complexity in the X-ray range indicates that several different mechanisms 
are contributing to the diffuse background (bremsstrahlung, Compton scat- 
tering, discrete X-ray sources, thermal emission of hot plasmas, recombina- 
tion radiation). A power law extrapolation with the same spectral index of 
-1.38 up to 300 keV is used to join the "/-ray data. This diffuse X-ray com- 
ponent consists probably of contributions from extragalactic sources (QSOs 
or nearby galaxies) and from galactic hot plasmas produced in SNRs and 
stellar winds. 
The flux in the "/-range is represented by several measurements and 
not by a simple power law. The data included range from 0.3MeV to 
27MeV (Trombka et al. 1973) and from 0.7MeV to 4.5MeV (Vedrenne 
et al. 1971). The two measurements at 22 MeV and 32 MeV are taken from 
Mayer-Hasselwander et al. (1972). All these "/-ray fluxes indicate an excess 
of diffuse "/-emission if the X-ray flux at 100keV (Metzger et al. 1964) is 
extrapolated to the OSO-III data at 100MeV (Kraushaar 1970). This fea- 
ture has no confirmed explanation but is clearly visible in Fig. 4 around the 
frequency of 1021 Hz. 

59 
The diffuse galactic 7-ray emission has recently been reviewed by Bloe- 
men (1989) and the "),-ray data ranging from 50 MeV up to 5 GeV shown 
in Fig. 4 are taken from this publication. Gamma-rays in the energy range 
above 100 MeV are produced by decay of rr°-mesons generated through colli- 
sions of cosmic rays around 1 GeV with the thermal plasma. The lower "),-ray 
energies are due to bremsstrahlung of cosmic ray electrons Ee,ctt g 100 MeV 
and due to inverse Compton scattering of high energy cosmic ray electrons 
Ee,crt g 10GeV on soft photons (e.g. 2.7K background radiation with 
hu ___ 6 10 -4 eV). All these three processes add up to the observed diffuse 
galactic emission but the a-°-decay exhibits a characteristic bump (Stecker 
1973) whereas the bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton emission are basi- 
cally given by power laws. However, the observed "/-ray intensity samples 
the matter or photon density along the line of sight and since our Galaxy 
is almost transparent to ")'-ray photons up to 1014eV the observations can 
be used to trace the interstellar matter and/or cosmic ray particles (see 
also Sect. 1.4.3). Although the relative contributions of these processes are 
expected to be a function of the position in the Galaxy the -),-ray intensity 
has been used in correlation with the observed (or inferred) cosmic ray in- 
tensity to determine the spatial distribution of H2 in our Galaxy. H2 is not 
observed directly but estimated from the observations of the CO (J = 1 ~ 0)- 
transition assuming a known conversion factor from the CO abundance to 
H2. The results, problems and different approaches are discussed e.g. in 
Bloemen (1989) but the "),-ray observations show that the total H2-mass in 
our Galaxy does not exceed 1.2 109M® compared to the total HI-mass of 
4.8 109M® (Henderson et al. 1982).

From the above discussion it should be clear that the radiation fluxes 
compiled in Fig. 4 can only exhibit the overall properties of the interstellar 
radiation field, because some regions in frequency are subject to observa- 

60 
tional uncertainties which could alter the presented values by factor of three 
(or more). 
Integrating over frequency the average specific intensity of the interstel- 
lar radiation field as displayed in Fig. (4) yields 
4~'Jrad = 
fvdv = 3:8810-2erg cm-2s -1. 
(24) 
The corresponding energy density is then given by 
Urad = 4rJrad/C = 0.81 eV cm -3. 
(25) 
Summarizing Fig. 4 very different processes operate in the ISM to pro- 
duce the diffuse background radiation. Note that locally large deviations 
from this averaged radiation field can exist. I emphasize again that the ra- 
diative energy density (Eq. 25) provides an important contribution to the 
overall energy balance of the ISM. 
1.4 Cosmic Rays 
1.4.1 General Remarks on Cosmic Rays 
Comprehensive and up-to-date information on all subjects related to cosmic 
rays can be obtained from the proceedings of the biannual International 
Cosmic Ray Con]erence, the last one in Dublin (1991). Hence, I will mention 
only some basic facts of cosmic rays relate.d to their various influences on 
the interstellar medium. Since the general process of particle acceleration 
in shock waves is discussed by Brain Achterbergs lecture (this volume) in 
great detail I can concentrate on the case of acceleration at the shock waves 
of an expanding SNR where in a nonlinear development the shock structure 
is modified by the reaction of the energetic particles on the thermal plasma 
flOW. 
Cosmic rays are high energy particles with energies well above the ther- 
mal velocities of the interstellar plasma. With respect to 2-body collisions 
cosmic rays are almost collisionless particles except for very low energies 
(~ 1 MeV). Nevertheless, these charged particles are closely linked to the 
magnetic field because they gyrate around the magnetic fields lines. For a 
proton the gyroradius in a homogeneous magnetic field B is given by 
= 
pc. 
(26) 
The interaction of cosmic rays with magnetic fields is considerably more 
complicated because in the presence of magnetic irregularities with a scale 
comparable to the gyroradius the particles are resonantly scattered in pitch 
angle (Jokipii 1966). Moreover, in the case of a cosmic ray gradient such 
Alfv6n waves are generated by the streaming instability (Lerche 1967, 

6] 
Wentzel 1968, Kulsrud & Pearce 1969) and the energetic particles are then 
scattered resonantly by circularly polarized Alfvdn waves propagating par- 
allel to the magnetic field B. Hence, cosmic rays can generate their own 
wave field which is scattering itself the particles. Since the particle speed is 
usually much larger than the AlfvSn velocity in a medium of density p 
B 2 
vl = 
(27) 
the resonance condition requires that the wavelength of the Alfv~n waves 
is equal to the gyro radius of the charged particle. If the damping of these 
waves is small (usually the case in the hot ISM) the waves can grow rapidly 
and the bulk cosmic ray velocity is reduced to the Alfvdn speed. 
The original idea to accelerate particles on magnetic fluctuations has 
been proposed by Fermi (1949) to explain cosmic rays. At that time he had 
to postulate an interstellar magnetic field of the order of # G to scatter the 
particles on magnetic clouds moving at random velocities. However, such 
an acceleration mechanism proceeds very slowly in time but the situation 
changes radically if an ordered motion of the fluctuations can be used oc- 
curring in a hydromagnetic shock wave. This process is nowadays called 
diffusive shock acceleration (cf. Sect. 1.4.3) because the energetic particles 
can be scattered (i.e. diffuse) across the shock front separating the down- 
stream and upstream media with different velocities. This concept appears 
to have been 'in the air' and has been invented by several people (Krymsky 
1977, Axford et al. 1978, Bell 1978ab, Blandford & Ostriker 1978). This pro- 
cess of shock acceleration provides a natural explanation of the power law 
energy distribution of cosmic rays. Depending on the physical parameters 
in shock waves the cosmic rays can gain energies up to about 1015eV/nuc 
(e.g. Axford 1981a, VSlk & Biermann 1988). The nonlinear modifications 
of the basic acceleration mechanism have been considered by Drury & VSlk 
(1981) or Axford et al. (1982). These authors show that particle accelera- 
tion can be very efficient converting almost all incoming kinetic energy into 
cosmic rays leaving the thermal plasma cold although the gas has passed 
across the shock (cf. also Sect. 1.4.3). 
The chemical composition of the primary component of cosmic rays is 
in general rather similar to the solar abundances (except for the under- 
abundance of hydrogen) if corrected for spallation products (so-called sec- 
ondaries) produced by passage through the interstellar medium (e.g. Simp- 
son 1983). Most measurements are done in an energy range 100 MeV - 
100 GeV/nuc and at higher energies the chemical information is still limited. 
However, there are some chemical anomalies which can not be attributed to 
interactions with the interstellar plasma. I want to mention the 22Ne/2°Ne 
isotope ratio which is increased by a factor of ~ 4 and following Meyer (1981) 
this overabundance can be explained if a small fraction (,-~ 0.02) of cosmic 
rays originates from material of quiescent He-burning stellar layers. Such a 

62 
suggestion leads to the question of how efficient terminal shocks of stellar 
winds can accelerate high energy particles. This topic has been reviewed by 
Cesarsky & Montmerle (1983) but according to them only a small fraction 
of the overall galactic cosmic rays can be generated by these stellar winds. 
The grammage is energy dependent (due to the energy dependent 
collisional cross sections) and at an energy of 5 GeV typical values are 
X ~ 7g cm -2 for the traversed interstellar material. However, Prishchep 
Ptuskin (1975) propose a galactic halo to reconcile the cosmic ray age 
determinations via measurements of unstable nuclei such as 1°Be with the 
observed grammage derived from the observed primary to secondary ratio. 
The spectrum for all particles are similar power laws in the energy range 
between about 101°eV/nuc and 101~eV/nuc and from obserwtions at the 
earth the differential spectrum of primary Galactic cosmic rays is given by 
dg(E) o¢ E-2"75:t:°'ldE 
(28) 
(e.g. Simpson 1983) where E denotes the particle energy. A clear break is 
visible in the spectrum at an energy of about 1015eV/nuc and at higher 
energies the power law spectrum steepens indicating an increasing contri- 
bution from extragalactic sources. Up to the mentioned particle energy the 
cosmic rays obey a large degree of isotropy which decreases for higher en- 
ergies. This observational fact suggests again that extragalactic particles 
become progressively more prominent at energies above 106 GeV. On the 
other hand from the small observed anisotropy for the galactic energies we 
can infer that a large number of sources generates and accelerates cosmic 
rays and/or that the ISM provides a considerable amount of scattering. 
Following the above statements I will restrict the subsequent discussion 
to the so-called galactic component of cosmic rays characterized by particles 
energies less than 1015eV/nuc. Note that as already stated in Eq. (2) the 
energy density of these particles is of the order of 
UcR - I eV cm -3. 
(29) 
The mean particle age is again energy dependent and can be inferred 
from the radioactive decay of the secondary nuclei, e.g. 1°Be. For low energy 
cosmic rays (~ 1 Gev/nuc) the average age is about rcR "2_ 2 107yr (Garcia- 
Mufioz et al. 1977). Writing the grammage like X ~_ cfiTCR an estimate can 
be obtained for the mean galactic density of ~ _~ 0.22 H-atoms cm -3 seen 
by these energetic particles. Since the observed mean density in our galaxy 
within a vertical scale height of 4-100 pc is about 0.4 H-atoms cm -3 (Burton 
& Liszt 1981) the cosmic ray storage (or confinement) volume Vsal,CR will 
be roughly given by HcR --~ +200 pc times the galactic disc radius of 15 kpc. 
The chemical analysis of terrestrial deep sea sediments and meteorites 
suggests that the cosmic rays intensity near the solar system has not varied 
more than a factor of 2 to 3 over the last few l0 s to 109 years (e.g. Honda 
1979). Due to the finite life time of cosmic rays in our Galaxy a certain 

63 
power is needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray energy density. This 
can be estimated by taking the mean storage volume and the mean life time 
of cosmic rays in our galaxy, i.e. 
HCR --~ 400 pc, Dclt ~-- 15 kpc, 
Ygal,CR = 7rHcrtD~R "2_ 1067cm -a (30) 
where HCR and DCR denote the mean galactic scale height and the mean 
disk area of cosmic rays. Combining the last two equations a simple estimate 
leads to the cosmic ray luminosity of our Galaxy 
Lg~l ca - fv 
--UcR dV "2_ 4 1040 erg S -1 
(31) 
' 
gal, CR TCR 
Since SN-explosions are the most powerful events in our GMaxy it is 
worth to compare the mean energy release by SNe to this number. Assuming 
a SN-rate of 7"SN = 1/30yr -1 and a typical explosion energy of ESN = 
1051erg the cosmic ray luminosity relates to the SN-luminosity by 
Lgal,CR --~ 0.04LsN = 0.04ESN~'SN. 
(32) 
Following this conservative estimate (e.g. Blandford 1988) it is clear that if 
only 0.04 ESN is transferred to high energy particles, this amount of energy 
is sufficient to explain the observed cosmic ray energy density. However, 
the mean energy released per SN-explosion can be smaller than 1051erg. 
The observed energy dependence of the grammage, i.e. X(p) o¢ pC' and 
a ~ 0.6 (Engelmann et al. 1985) derived from the primary to secondary 
ratio increases the estimate of Eq. (32) by a factor up to about 10 depending 
on assumptions on the spectral index of the primary cosmic rays and on a 
(Drury et al. 1989). Thus if SNRs are the main source of galactic cosmic rays 
both effects enhance the value of 0.04 ESN and consequently, the process of 
diffusive shock acceleration has to transfer as an upper limit about 
Lgal,CR __'2 0.3 LSN. 
(33) 
into high energy particles. Employing these numbers it becomes clear that 
cosmic rays have to influence the dynamics of SNR evolution because 
the shock structures are modified by the nonlinear acceleration process 
(cf. Sect. 2.5). 
1.4.2 Influence of Cosmic Rays on the ISM Dynamics 
We can distinguish two main aspects of cosmic ray influence on dynamical 
effects in the ISM. First, changes which are related to a modification of the 
shock structure itself if particles are significantly accelerated, and secondly, 
a different behaviour of large scale flows due to the existence of a relativistic 
fluid exerting an additional pressure. The first part is discussed in Sect. 1.4.3 

64 
and hence, I briefly mention several other aspects of cosmic ray interactions 
occurring in the ISM (see also VSlk 1987). 
From the above considerations it should be clear that particle accelera- 
tion can modify the evolution of SNR's since the kinetic energy dissipated in 
the shock waves is shared between the thermal plasma and the cosmic rays. 
As a consequence the amount of X-ray emitting gas is different compared 
to the case where no particles are accelerated (cf. Sect.2.7). 
As discussed in Sect. 1.2 cosmic rays provide the most important source 
of heating and ionizing the dense parts of interstellar clouds. Beside this 
energy deposition they play a crucial role in driving the chemistry of diffuse 
clouds which is responsible for the formation of a large number of complex 
molecules (see e.g. the review by Dalgarno 1987). 
Since the work of Parker (1966) it is well established that cosmic rays and 
magnetic fields play an important role in a possible hydrostatic equilibrium 
perpendicular to the galactic plane where the gravitational acceleration is 
balanced by the gas pressure, the magnetic pressure and the cosmic ray 
pressure. The magnetic field is parallel to the galactic plane (cf. also the 
observations of the magnetic field in Sect. 1.5.3) but such a configuration 
is unstable if the scale of the perturbation exceeds a certain limit (Parker 
1966). The field lines are compressed in one region where the matter can 
slide down along the magnetic field reaching a new equilibrium and forming 
clouds and subsequently OB-associations separated by regions of field lines 
extending to larger galactic latitudes (Mouschovias et al. 1974). The final 
states of this Parker instability have been calculated by Mouschovias (1976). 
The problems of maintaining a stable vertical configuration in the presence 
of numerous energy releasing phenomena has been reviewed e.g. by Stephens 
(1991). 
Recently a number of models driving a galactic wind by cosmic rays 
and the dissipation of Alfv~n waves have been constructed (Breitschwerdt 
et al. 1990) showing the importance of this relativistic fluid with 7c ---= 4/3 
acting on the thermally lifted gas. A more detailed description is placed at 
the end of this chapter in Sect. 1.6.2. 
The cosmic rays collide with the thermal plasma producing neutral pi- 
ons which decay into observable "),-rays above hu ~ 100 MeV. This process 
provides a natural explanation for the good correlation of the gas density 
with the diffuse 7-rays (Kniffen et al. 1977) if the cosmic ray flux at any 
point is proportional to the gas density. This can be justified by arguing that 
the cosmic rays are constrained by the magnetic fields which themselves are 
linked to the interstellar gas. The diffuse "),-emission is then proportional to 
the line of sight integral of the mass density squared (i.e. the column den- 
sity squared) and consequently, the accumulation of matter in clouds yields 
a higher 7-luminosity. However, different groups arrive at different conclu- 
sions about the radial distribution of molecular hydrogen in our Galaxy, 
i.e. the so-called molecular ring at 4-7kpc from the galactic center (see 

65 
e.g. the recent review of Bloemen 1989). Nevertheless it seems clear that 
v-rays produced by cosmic ray interactions are a very useful tool to probe 
the large scale structure of the galactic H2-distribution. 
All radio observations of SNR's are based on the synchrotron emission 
of relativistic electrons gyrating around magnetic field lines (see Sect. 1.5.2 
for actual magnetic field values). Since the acceleration mechanism in shock 
waves presented above works also in the case of electrons this large num- 
ber of data is a very strong although indirect indication that also protons 
or ions can be accelerated in SNR's. At this point I can mention measure- 
ments on the shock acceleration of particles in a much less energetic envi- 
ronment, namely the earth's bow shock (e.g. Kennel et al. 1985) which are 
in nice agreement with the predictions from diffusive particle acceleration 
(Lee 1982). 
This short list of cosmic ray interactions (also included in the overview, 
Fig. 1) stresses again the fact that any realistic modelling of the ISM has to 
include cosmic rays as well as magnetic fields. On the other hand the subse- 
quent considerations will show that such a task requires rather cumbersome 
numerical simulations to account for the nonlinearities involved in all these 
interactions. 
1.4.3 Diffusive Shock Acceleration and Cosmic Ray Hydrodynamcis 
In the so-called test particle picture where the reaction of the energetic 
particles on flow is neglected the acceleration process leads to a simple power 
law (e.g. Drury 1983, or Achterberg this Volume). A schematic picture of 
a shock wave is shown in Fig. 5 where the particles are scattered between 
the downstream and the upstream regions gaining energy at each passage of 
the shock front. The pitch-angle scattering occurs at magnetic fluctuations 
moving with the Alfv6n velocities (27) VA,1 and VA,2, respectively. Note that 
vn,2 = x/VVA,1 where r denotes the compression ratio. In a shock wave with 
a downstream velocity ul and an upstream velocity u2 we have 
Ul 
3r 
q=-- 
(34) 
u2 
r - 1 
and the solution depends only on the compression ratio r and the particle 
distribution function f(p) in momentum p is given by 
f(p) c( p-q. 
(35) 
A detailed discussion including solutions with injection of particles, wave 
fields and different upstream particle distributions can be found e.g. in Drury 
(1983) and therefore will be omitted here. 
Because of their relevance to the subsequent SNR evolution I mention 
the nonlinear modifications occurring in diffusive particle acceleration if the 
backreactions of the energetic particles on the thermal plasma and on the

pendent shock structure including cosmic ray acceleration (Drury &: V61k 
1981). The Mach-number M and the ratio N of the cosmic ray pressure Pc 
to the total pressure in a flow of velocity u and density p can be defined by

The energetic particles accelerated at the shock develop a gradient into the 
upstream region through diffusion slowing down the incoming plasma al- 
ready before the shock front is encountered. This so-called precursor has 
a length scale associated with the mean cosmic ray diffusion coefficient 
and the plasma inflow velocity ul, i.e. R/Ul (cf. Fig. 6). For moderate Mach 
numbers M g 6 a pure plasma subshock is still embedded in the structure 
where the transitions of the particle pressure Pc as well as of the cosmic 
ray flux Fc remain continuous across the whole shock front. In the case 
of strong shocks (M • 6) even smooth transitions are possible where the 
thermal plasma is only compressed adiabatically. Taking fully relativistic 
particles, i.e. 7c = 4/3 the compression ratio increases to r = 7 and in a 
totally smoothed shock front the amour of kinetic energy dissipated to the 
thermal plasma is reduced to r -2 = 7 -2 = 0.02 meaning that 98% of the 
shock energy is dumped into cosmic rays. However, in a certain parame- 
ter regime of the M, N-plane (N, M defined by Eq. 36) the downstream 
solution is not uniquely determined by the upstream values and the Mach 
number (e.g. Drury 1983). Nonlinear shock structures in the presence of the 

67 
scattering field and accelerated particles have been constructed by Vhlk et 
al. (1984) showing that the waves in strong shocks grow to large amplitudes 
already in the precursor region of the shock but this (formal) conclusion is 
based on a linear perturbation analysis of the wave field (McKenzie & Vhlk 
1984). Up to now it is not clear how the system will react in such a situation 
but nonlinear damping mechanisms like Landau damping (Vhlk et al. 1984) 
may limit the amplitudes of the waves.

including the precursor region and a pure gas subshock 
The question how the energetic particles modify the shock structure can 
be approached by treating the accelerated particles like a hydrodynamical 
fluid. In this case the cosmic ray pressure Pc or the energy density Ec are 
incorporated in the hydrodynamical description of the thermal plasma and 
these quantities are then defined by appropriate moments of the particle 
distribution function f(p). The resulting equations are presented in Sect. 2.5. 
Such a description of cosmic ray hydrodynamics (see Sect. 2.5.2) con- 
tains only hydrodynamical quantities which may be difficult to determine 
(e.g. Drury et al. 1989). However, I will use this set of equations through- 
out the following sections to take into account the nonlinear modifications in 
shock waves. The propagation of small disturbances in this two-fluid system 
has been investigated by Ptuskin (1981) who shows that very long wave- 
length waves couple to the cosmic rays and travel at an enhanced speed of 
[(%Pc + vsPg)/p] 1/2 used also in the definition of the Mach-number through 
Eq. (36). Short wavelength disturbances decouple from the cosmic rays and 
propagate at the ordinary gas sound speed of (3~gPg/p)i/2. 
The time-dependent evolution of a plane shock wave accelerating parti- 
cles is displayed in Fig. 7 where the flow is reflected at the left boundary

sending a shock wave to the right. The parameters used fix the Mach-number 
at M = 11.2, the upstream pressure ratio of N = 0.5 and the adiabatic index 
of cosmic rays of 7c = 3/2. The time is given in units of the diffusion time 
scale td -=- ~/u 2 and us denotes the shock speed. After about 8 ta the time 
asymptotic values are reached showing a smoothed shock propagatingto the 
left and compressing the thermal gas only adiabatically (cf. Fig. 7c). Almost 
all kinetic energy dissipated at the shock goes into cosmic rays which build 
up the pressure Pc in downstream region. Note that during the transition 
from a gas dominated shock wave to a cosmic ray dominated one the overall 
compression ratio can become rather large (up to 10 seen in the density, 
cf. Fig. 7a) because we have a precursor region where the incoming gas is 
decelerated and compressed and on top of that flow a subshock enhances 
the total compression. In addition we see motions towards the shock wave 
in the downstream region caused by the diffusive decrease of the cosmic ray 
gradient which is compensated by a flow pushed by the remaining gradient 
of the thermal gas. These small positive velocities (cf. Fig. 7b in the region 
1 ~ x ~ 2) are maintaining the pressure equilibrium in the downstream re- 
gion. The late evolution can be compared to the time asymptotic analytical 
solutions of Drury & VSlk (1981). The final compression ratio is r = 6 in 
agreement for strong shocks with % = 3/2. 
We emphasize that such transitions should also occur during the evolu- 
tion of SNRs if particle acceleration becomes so efficient that most of the 
downstream pressure is provided by the energetic particles and not by the 
thermal plasma. In Sect. 2.5 we will discuss such remnants in more detail 
where most of the SN-explosion energy is transferred to cosmic rays lead- 
ing to significantly lower gas temperatures compared to the cases without 
important particle acceleration. 
1.5 Magnetic fields 
As mentioned in the previous section cosmic rays and magnetic fields are 
linked together and I start this chapter by summarizing some observa- 
tional facts. Basic physical effects exist to measure either the magnetic field 
strength Bll parallel to the line of sight or in the perpendicular direction, 
i.e. B±. 
1.5.1 Measurements of 1311 
Without going too much into details magnetic fields lead to a splitting of 
atomic levels and this pattern can be observed if the transition has a suffi- 
ciently large Land~ factor g. This is the case for the hydrogen atom where 
Zeeman splitting in the 21 cm line has been found first in different galac- 
tic directions by Verschuur (1969). The other case of detectable Zeeman- 
splitting is the OH-molecule which is well suited to probe the magnetic field 

70 
strength in dense clouds by maser emission. A magnetic field component BII 
parallel to the line of sight leads to a wavelength displacement A~ given by 
the relation 
AA - 2r--~ec2 AZBII. 
(37) 
Note that the Zeeman splitting samples the magnetic fields in the cold 
matter of our galaxy. 
A linear polarized wave changes its angle of polarization due to Faraday 
rotation. The different propagation speed for left- vs. right-hand side circular 
polarized radiation is related to the direction of the gyration of electrons 
causing a different index of refraction. Thus the angle of rotation ~ of linear 
polarized radiation is a function of the wavelength A defining the so-called 
rotation measure RM, i.e. 
= RM$ 2 + ~0, 
RM = 0.81 f n~Biidl 
(38) 
where ne is given in cm -3, Bjj in #G and the integral along the distance to 
the source in parsecs. In the case of pulsed emission the time a signal reaches 
the detector again depends on frequency leading to a so-called dispersion 
measure 
DM = / n~dl 
(39) 
which averages the electron density ne along the line of sight. The ratio 
RM/DM provides a direct measurement of the parallel field strength BII 
along the line of sight averaged over the electron density. In the direction 
of the Crab pulsar this quantity is DM = 56.9pccm -3 (Manchester 1972) 
which for a source distance of d = 2 kpc gives a mean electron density of n~ = 
0.028cm -3. Taking the average electron density to be (n~) ~- 0.03cm -3 
leads to a rule of tumb for the mean pulsar distance (e.g. Lyne 1990) 
DM 
d ~ ~ 
kpc. 
(40) 
A large number of RM/DM measurements have been used to determine the 
structure of the magnetic field (Manchester 1974, Hamilton & Lyne 1987) 
indicating a local field in the spiral arm of about Bll ~ 2 - 3 #G directed 
towards ~ = 90 ° as well as a field reversal around ~ = 50 °. In addition there 
exists a random field of the same magnitude having a scale of about 100 pc. 
Note that the RM and DM is produced in the medium with an important 
contributions of the electron density ne along the line of sight, i.e. mainly 
in the warm ionized medium, the WIM already introduced in Sect. 1.2. 

71 
1.5.2 Measurements of B± 
Historically the polarization of starlight is the first observational fact which 
has been used to deduce the existence of a magnetic field revealed by an 
alignment of non-spherical dust grains along the magnetic field lines. The 
physical mechanism of alignment of dust grains against the bombardment of 
gas particles can be found in Purcell (1979) and is based on the rare ejection 
of H2-molecules which carry large kinetic energies and which are formed on 
the surface of these dust grains. The observed linear polarization leads to an 
estimate of the strength or at least of the orientation of the perpendicular 
component B±. An example of the overall magnetic field structure of the 
dark cloud near Rho Ophiuchus is given in Vrba et al. (1976) showing a 
nice alignment of the magnetic field with the filaments. These filaments are 
directed towards more dense blobs with a star forming region inside and 
the vectors in these blobs tend to be perpendicular to the filaments. The 
magnetic field strength in these blobs is of the order of about 10 #G. 
Synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons gyrating around magnetic 
field lines produces linear polarized radiation parallel to the direction of 
the acceleration (Ginzburg & Syrovatskii 1965). Thus the polarization is 
perpendicular to the magnetic field leading to a polarization perpendicular 
to B±. In a uniform field the degree of polarization can be rather high, 
i.e. up to 75% but in all astrophysical situations we have to add a random 
component to the magnetic field decreasing the observable polarization.

A large number of observations can be found in the proceedings of the 
IAU Symposium on 'Galactic and Intergalactic Magnetic Fields (Beck et 
al. 1990) including detailed measurements of magnetic fields in different 
SNR's like the Crab Nebula with B ~ 0.3rag (Kennel & Coroniti 1984) 
or Kepler's SNR with B _~ 70 #G (Matsui et al. 1984). A number of these 

72 
remants exhibit a radial field but the magnetic field in the Cygnus Loop is 
tangential and van der Laan (1962) deduces a compression by a factor of 4 
from the synchrotron emission (cf. also next section). 
On the galactic scales this physical effect can be used over a wide range 
of radio frequences to determine the magnetic field structures of external 
galaxies showing also a large number of galaxies with rather ordered field 
structures. A few results are summarized in Table 4 (adopted from Krause 
1990) to illustrate possible field configurations of our Galaxy. According to 
present galactic dynamo theories (cf. next section) the dynamo can generate 
most easily either an axisymmetric spiral structure (ASS) in its fundamental 
mode (m = 0) or a bisymmetric spiral structure (BSS) through the first 
excited mode (m = 1). 
1.5.3 Remarks on galactic magnetic fields 
Summarizing the observational facts a large scale (L ,,~ 1 kpc) ordered field 
permeates the Galaxy and a clear tendency for alignment along the spiral 
arms can be inferred from the data. In the vicinity of the solar system 
the magnetic field has a strength of B0 ~ 1.6 #G. However, a small scale 
(1 pc g L g 100pc) irregular (turbulent) component is also visible having 
a typical average field strength of about Bsal ~_ 4 #G. Adopting this value 
the corresponding energy density results in 
Vmag = 
0.4eVcm_3. 
(41) 
8~r 
However, as seen in the OH-data much larger field strengths occur at certain 
places within the ISM because the magnetic field can be amplified by several 
events. 
Magnetic fields are Compressed in shock waves. If the index 1 denotes 
the upstream quantities and 2 the downstream values the condition of flux 
freezing (49) yields

and in the case of a strong shock with an adiabatic index of 3' = 5/3 the 
downstream field is

but 
P2>>~, 
i.e. the downstream thermal pressure P2 usually exceeds the magnetic pres- 
sure. 
Magnetic fields are also amplified by contraction and if we assume flux 
freezing (cf. Eq. 49) mass and magnetic flux conservation in a spherical 
symmetric contraction from initial values Ri, pi and Bi to final values R, p 
and B yields 

73

(44)

which relates the magnetic field strength B to the density p 
B--:, = 
(45) 
where in the spherical case ~ = 2/3. However, this exponent ~¢ depends 
strongly on the adopted geometry. If rotation inhibits a spherical coUaps the 
magnetic field increases more rapidly, i.e. 2/3 ~ ~ ~ 1 (e.g. Mestel 1977). 
In the case where the matter can slip along the field lines n decreases and 
from a sequence of equilibrium configurations Mouschovias (1976) deduces 
Bcx pl/2 
(46) 
which is also in good agreement with the observations of magnetic fields 
inside dense clouds. According to Troland ~z Heiles (1986) magnetic field 
strengths obtained for OH Zeeman splitting are 9#G for Cas.A, ll#G 
for W22, 38 #G for Ori B and 120 #G for Ori A. In the cases of OH-maser 
emission located in regions of densities around 106cm -3 Lo et al. (1975) find 
for six masers magnetic fields between 2.5 mG and 9.0 raG. Thus, magnetic 
fields of the order of mG are typical for very dense cores of interstellar clouds 
where Eq. (45) gives the right magnetic field amplification if ~; _~ 1/2. 
The large scale evolution of magnetic fields (e.g. Parker 1979) can be 
described by an equation obtainable from Ohm's law in a conducting fluid 
j = a 
E +

(47)

and Maxwell's equations yielding in the MHD-approximation (invariant un- 
der Galilei transformations) 
0B

(48)

where a denotes the conductivity. Depending on the value of a the magnetic 
field is either 'frozen' in the flow (a --+ c¢) or is characterized by a diffusion 
equation in the case without motions (u = 0). The concept of frozen-in 
magnetic fields can be illustrated by defining the magnetic flux ~ through 
a closed material curve C 
d~ 
Jc c . 
d--t- = -

(49) 
which remains constant in a perfectly conducting fluid, i.e. a ---* cx~. In this 
case we can also combine the equation of mass conservation with (48) and 
get 

74 
b-/ 
= 7" Vu 
(50) 
showing that B/p statisfies the same equation for a moving line element. 
For example, in a spherical compressive flow u = (ar, 0, 0) with a < 0, 
in polar radiM coordinates any line element decreases linearly in r while 
the density of a fluid element at position r(t) increases as r -a. Hence, the 
magnetic field B flowing a fluid element will increase as r -2 in accordance 
with the results obtained by Eq. (45). 
Equation (48) has interesting consequences on the large scale evolution of 
plasmas since the magnetic field can link spatially distinct regions exerting 
forces on them which lead to a transport of angular momentum by Alfv~n 
waves. Such a process is called magnetic braking (Ebert et al. 1960, Gillis et 
al. 1974, 1979, Mouschovias 85 Palaleogou 1979, 1980) and is able to remove 
the angular momentum from a contracting interstellar cloud. Without the 
loss of angular momentum the centrifugal forces inhibit the formation of 
dense cores and this so-called angular momentum problem (Mestel 1965) 
can be solved by magnetic fields. However, at some stage of star formation 
magnetic fields cannot remain frozen in the fluid because Eqs. (45) and (46) 
lead to an amplification of the magnetic field which is not observed in stars. 
On the other hand the theory has to explain why so little flux treading the 
original cloud has survived the process of star formation. Ambipolar diffu- 
sion (Mestel & Spitzer 1956) due to a drift between ions and neutrals lowers 
the initial flux through the cloud. The exact value of the critical particle 
density n¢ when the field decouples from the matter is still controversial 
(Nakano 1984, Mouschovias et al. 1985) and ranges between 104cm -3 and 
10ncm -3. Note that analytical solutions in simple symmetries of (48) show 
oscillations which can provide a natural explanation for retrograde rotating 
objects if the field can decouple at the time of such occurrences. 
Figures 8a,b shows the results of full 3D-MHD calculations (Dorfi 1989) 
where the evolution of the total specific angular momentum J/Mcl of a cloud 
with mass Md and radius Rcl is plotted as a function of the dimensionless 
external Alfv6n crossing time Rcl/VA,ex t. The three curves correspond to 
different inclinations between the axis of rotation and the magnetic field 
of 3#G, i.e. 8 = 0 ° shown by the full curve, 8 = 45 ° by the dashed one 
and ~ = 90 ° by the dash-dotted one. They demonstrate that the typical 
braking time scales may differ only by a factor of 3. Note that already af- 
ter a free-fall time tff oc (Gpd) -1/2 the initial homogeneous cloud develops 
very non-homologous structures under the joint action of gravity, rotation 
and magnetic fields. Such structures are typical for the observed interstel- 
lar clouds. An inclined magnetic field has an additional precessional torque 
(cf. Fig. 8b) which tends to align the angular momentum vector along the 
magnetic field direction and depending on the time when the field decou- 
ples from the matter almost any final angular momentum direction can be 
achieved. Fig. 8b depicts the evolution of the three components (Jx, Jy, Jz)

(full, dashed, dash-dotted) of the angular momentum vector in the inclined 
case of 8 --- 45 °. I have elucidated this example in more detail because the 
inclusion of magnetic fields introduces a number of new effects making im- 
portant differences compared to a theory neglecting magnetic fields. This 
also results in a much better agreement with observations. A more thorough 
discussion of the interaction of magnetic fields with interstellar clouds can 
be found e.g. in Mestel (1990 and references therein). 
In the case of small scale turbulent motions Eq. (48) has to be modified 
according to the so-called mean-field electrodynamics (Kranse ~ R£dler 
1980) which is obtained by averaging over the fluctuating component 
0B 
= V x (u x B) +V x (aB) +~V2B 
(51) 
0t 
where r/includes now also a turbulent diffusivity. In addition the so-called 
a-term has been introduced and the coefficients a and r/'hide' the informa- 
tion about the turbulent motions. In the simple case of homogeneous and 
isotropic turbulence this a-term can be estimated (e.g. Moffatt 1978) 
1 
a = 5u. (v × u) 
(52) 
and a ¢ 0 means that the flow has a finite helicity. This a-effect is at the 
heart of all modern dynamo theory. If we think of the mean field the a-term 
will generate a current parallel or antiparallel to B which can result in an 
enhancement of the mean field depending on the preferred sense of rotation. 
At this point I also want to mention that since flow lines can be regarded 
as directed lines a connection between dynamo theory and theory of knots 
has been established (e.g. Chap. 6 of Zeldovich et al. 1983 and references 
therein). 
An estimate on the a-effect in the case of galaxies is given by Vainshtein 
& Ruzmainkin (1972) taking a ~ 12w/H where 1 _ 100pc _ H (e.g. Bur- 
ton & Liszt 1981) is the typical scale of an individual turbulent eddy in 
a confined galactic disk and w _~ 10-1% -1 the mean galactic angular ve- 
locity. Fountain or superbubble flows (cf. Sect. 1.6) show cyclonic motions 
on even larger scales generating their own dynamo effect. The scale length 
I can be as large as the size of a superbubble breaking out of the disk, 
i.e. I ~ kpc and possibly increasing a by a factor of about 10. Without 
going into the details of dynamo theory I sketch a few basic features im- 
portant for the magnetic field generation on a galactic scale. The observed 
regular properties of the galactic magnetic field (cf. Sect. 1.5.1) as well as 
of extragalactic fields (cf. Table 4) suggest dynamo action with the main 
modes m = 0 (axisymmetric, ASS) or m = 1 (bisymmetric, BSS) excited 
(Ruzmaikin et al. 1988). They also show that larger deviations from solid 
body rotation will decrease the growth rates of non-axisymmetric modes. 
However, up to now none of the models for galactic dynamos takes into 

?? 
account the spiral structure, tidal disturbances of the disk or the disk-halo 
connection (cf. Sect. 1.6.1). The basis of current dynamo theories is a purely 
kinematical point of view, i.e. the forces of the magnetic field on the flowing 
matter are neglected. Beside the large scale fields the small scale fields play 
an important role for the ISM, e.g. for the propagation of cosmic rays and 
their confinement or for star formation, support and stability of magnetized 
clouds. 
1.6 Further remarks 
In recent years the evidence has grown that the understanding of the ISM is 
also closely connected to the halo dynamics. Hence, this section is devoted 
to processes going beyond the galactic plane. A simple model for rising 
hot gas to a galactic corona at kiloparsec distances considers the repeated 
SN-explosions in young stellar groups (Chevalier & Gardner 1974). Such 
so-called superbubbles are discussed in more detail in the following section. 
If this rising gas is confined to the Galaxy the material will circulate and 
can fall back as cooler clumps to the galactic plane in the case a thermal 
instability operates in the halo. Such a scenario has been called a galactic 
fountain (Shapiro • Field 1976). However, if the gas is able to leave the 
Galaxy driven e.g. by cosmic rays and/or dissipation of Alfv~n waves we 
have to deal with an important sink for the galactic ISM and several aspects 
of these galactic winds are discussed in Sect. 1.6.2. 
1.6.1 Supershells 
Most stars are born in clusters and become visible in the optical range as 
so-called OB-associations (e.g. Gies 1987). Since more massive stars evolve 
more rapidly than low mass stars the OB-association still exists when the 
first supernova (SN) explodes. Therefore SNe are not distributed randomly 
over our entire galaxy but a certain degree of clustering must be taken 
into account. Such arguments are favoured after giant HI-shells (also called 
'worms' or 'chimneys') have been observed in the Milky Way (Heiles 1979, 
1984). The typical dimensions run from L ,~ 100pc up to L ,~ 1 kpc, the 
kinetic energy content is in the range of 1050 up to 10S3erg and the kine- 
matical ages can be estimated between 107 and 108 years. Brinks & Shane 
(1984) have detected 140 holes found in the 21 cm emission of M31 having 
typical radii between L ,~ 125 and L ,v 300 pc. Similar structures are known 
in the SMC and M101. Many of these holes contain OB-associations and 
about 20% have bright HII-rims due to the shorter life time of the brighter 
O-stars responsible for the ionizing radiation. 
The theoretical explanation is based on the work of Weaver et al. (1977) 
where a model of repeated SN-explosions from OB-associations is devel- 
oped by analogy with the theory of wind driven bubbles. Stellar evolution

calculations and theory of Type II SNe predict that all stars with masses 
M ~ 7 M® will explode and release a large amount of energy in the region 
of such an OB-association. Using stellar evolution calculations the typical 
life time for explosive energy input is given by the evolution time scale of a 
7 M®-star, i.e.TOB ~-- 5 107yr. If the energy released per explosion is denoted

Fig. 9. Geometry of the thin shell approximation 
In the case of a constant external density p0 the expansion of such a wind 
driven bubble can been calculated according to the thin shell approximation, 
i.e. AR << R for all times. However, if a strong shock is assumed with 
pl - 4 p0 and if the shell mass equals the swept-up mass, the thickness of 
the shell can be estimated

However, to solve this equation an expression for the interior pressure is

However, this simple theory does not consider important modifications 
for the late evolution of superbubbles. First, due to the large dimensions 
(el. Eq. 62) is is very likely that the bubble will expand bejond the typi- 
cal galactic scale height and will 'open' the galaxy towards a galactic halo. 
In this case the galactic gravitational potential g(z) has to be included 
which results in deviations from spherical symmetry. The variations in the 
galactic acceleration cannot be neglected since also the external density, 
i.e. no(z) decreases with the distance z from the galactic plane. Secondly, 
a large numer of interstellar clouds is overrun by the expansion shock wave 
and consequently, the density inside the superbubble increases through the 
evaporation of the compressed and stripped interstellar clouds. Thirdly, ra- 
diative cooling becomes important which can lead to a fragmentation of the 
expanding shell. As pointed out by McCray (1987) radiative cooling sets in 
after 
tcool,SB ~ 4106( -L5 (N.E51) °'3 no °'7 yr 
(65) 
because the interior starts radiating the energy away. ( denotes the met- 
alicity in solar system units. Around the time of tcool,SB the expansion is 
slowed down mad as stated earlier the HII-emission dies out when the last 
O-star explodes in a SN. 
From the above considerations it is clear that the radius of these super- 
bubbles increases with galactocentric distance because the mean external 
density no decreases and some fragments of these giant shell can be named 
'worms' or 'chimneys' seen in HI. The structure of the ISM in a galaxy 
can be dominated by these large bubbles and it becomes plausible to define 
also a 2-dimensional analogon to the 3-dimensional porosity parameter Q 
of Eq. (16) by 
RSB

where the typical area of a superbubble and their life time is given by

"rSB ---- RSBVISM- 
(67) 
Note that more advanced models of the ISM also have to consider the galac- 
tocentric distance with respect to the type of SNe exploding at certain posi- 
tions. The centrM region of a galaxy is dominated by old Type I SNe wheras 
in the 'molecular ring' region Type II SNe occur more frequently. At this 
point it should be clear that a galactic modelling of the ISM can depend 
strongly on the location within the galaxy. 
Beside this different dimensionality (Eq. 66) the formation of clumps 
or clouds in this cooling shells will lead to an almost ballistical infall onto 
the galactic plane and the model of Bregman (1980) suggests a typical 
height of cloud formation at some 5 kpc. The infall velocities can reach up 
to 100 km s -1 consistent with 21cm observations. The circulation of gas in 
supersheUs or galactic fountains can clearly influence the structure of the hot 

81 
gas and correspondingly the filling factor fHIM because of large mass and 
energy fluxes occurring in these superbubbles. Since the energy to drive 
such flows comes from spatially and temporally correlated SN-exptosions 
the galactic fountains are dynamic phenomena connected to the combined 
remnants from many SNe. These superbubbles expand rapidly and they 
soon break out of the galactic disk (cf. Eq. 62) resulting in an upward flow 
to the halo. The conseqhences of this disk-halo interaction on the structure 
of the ISM as well as the modifications on the halo are discussed by Norman 
& Ikeuchi (1989). 
The magnetic field will be convected along with this flow generating a 
complex field topology in the fountain but having also a magnetic field par- 
allel to the flow, i.e. vertical to the disk. Reconnection can further rearrange 
the magnetic flux if this reconnection proceeds faster than the typical flow 
times through the fountain and if an amplification of the magnetic field is 
possible (Kahn 1991). After a typical cycle time of about 3 l0 T years the gas 
and the amplified magnetic field are falling down onto the galactic plane 
and dissipate some of their kinetic energy in shock waves. Hence, fountain- 
like flows can provide an important contribution to the galactic magnetic 
field and can also influence the operation of the galactic dynamo because 
of the forced magnetic field circulation resulting for example in a different 
value of a-term in Eqs. (51,52) and because of the change in the appropriate 
boundary conditions of a galactic dynamo. 
1.6.2 Galactic winds 
From the properties of cosmic rays as discussed in Sect. 1.4 it is clear that 
a number of high energy particles can leave the Galaxy as inferred from 
the energy dependent confinement time. The question of a galactic halo has 
been adressed by many authors (e.g. Burke 1968, Johnson i: Axford 1971, 
Mathews & Baker 1971, Chevalier & Oegerle 1979) but all these models do 
not include the influence of high energy particles. Axford (1981b) suggests 
that the escape of cosmic rays can give rise to an expanding galactic corona 
and Ipavich (1975) has constructed a model of a galactic wind driven by 
cosmic rays and based on a one-dimensional spherical geometry. Given the 
estimates presented in Sect. 1.4.1 the energy loss of our Galaxy by cosmic 
rays can reach up to Lg~l,Ctt -~ 104ierg s -1 but the cosmic rays have a scale 
height larger than the thermal gas. Note that these high energy particles 
are unable to cool thermally in contrast to the gas. The large volume avail- 
able to store energetic particles in the galactic halo has been employedby 
Biermann i: Davis (1958) to explain the observed isotropy of cosmic rays. 
Such conclusions relating the cosmic ray data to properties of the halo are 
closely connected to the particle transport in the halo and correspondingly 
to the energy-dependence of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient: The depen- 
dence of this cosmic ray escape length ,ke from the Galaxy seems to indicate 
a $e c( R -°'s where R denotes the particles rigidity (becoming equivalent 

82 
to the momentum at high energies). This power law can be extrapolated to 
rigidities up to about 20 MeV/c/nuc based on measurements of the HEAO-3 
spacecraft (Engelman et ai. 1985). 
Since the work of Parker (1966) it has become evident that the sys- 
tem containing gas, cosmic rays and magnetic fields is unstable whenever 
a magnetic field line becomes elevated so that the gas slides down towards 
the galactic plane and the lower density regions get inflated by the cosmic 
ray pressure. We can consider this instability as a basic starting point for 
the generation of a galactic halo. On the other hand the combined effect of 
clustered SNe makes it very likely that hot gas is lifted to a galactic corona 
at kiloparsec distances as shown in the previous section. According to the 
survey of Gies (1987) about 70% of the O-stars occur in groups within a 
typical radius of about 10 pc. These SNe clustered in OB-assoziations can 
break through the extended neutral disk (Lockman et al. 1986) into the 
halo defined by regions above and below the galactic plane at [z] > 1 kpc. 
So taking both effects (cosmic rays and clustered SNe) together it seems 
plausible to discuss the existence of a galactic wind in more detail. 
Following the recent work of Breitschwerdt et al. (1991) it is useful to 
adopt a simple flux tube geometry where the area cross section A(z) scales 
like 
A(z)=Ao 
1+ 
~0 
(68) 
and z0 = 15kpc. Taking z << z0 implies A(z) ~- const., whereas large dis- 
tances z >> z0 yield a radial dependence of A(z) (x z 2. This flux tube 
geometry allows a more realistic modelling of a galactic wind since in the 
vicinity of the galactic plane an almost linear structure is achieved whereas 
at larger distances the adiabatic losses are included due to A(z) (x z 2. To- 
gether with a given gravitational galactic potential the set of steady state 
equations, i.e. the time-independent version of Eqs. (116)-(122) modified 
with respect to the geometry of A(z) can be solved for an outflow passing 
a critical point (X-type singularity). In considering the halo dynamics it is 
essential to include selfexcited magnetic fluctuations 5B (e.g. Lerche 1967, 
Wentzel 1968, Kulsrud &: Pearce 1969) and these waves can couple strongly 
to the gas of the halo which is ionized by OB-stars, globular clusters and 
extragalactic sources (see e.g. Bregman &5 Harrington 1986). Therefore an 
additional wave pressure Pw = ((~B)2)/87r acts on the ionized thermal gas. 
As long as the gas is unable to cool the ion-neutral friction (Kulsrud & 
Pearce 1969) cannot damp the waves. In the case of damping the cosmic 
rays stream through the gas without dragging the thermal plasma with 
them, i.e K --+ c¢. Note that the regions below Iz[ < lkpc are dominated 
by the diffuse propagation of cosmic rays rather than by streaming along 
the field lines (e.g. Breitschwerdt el al. 1991). These regions ([z[ < lkpc) 
are highly disturbed by SN-explosions and also subject to a z-dependent 
mass loading from SNRs caused by the z-dependence of O-stars becoming 

83 
a SN. Observations suggest a typical scale height of SN of HSN "~ 55 pc 
(Bregman 1980). Note that these models of Breitschwerdt et al. (1991) ne- 
glect the diffusion of cosmic rays (?~ = 0) and start at a reference level of 
z = 1 kpc where the boundary conditions are specified. However, according 
to the present cosmic ray propagation models (Ginzburg k Ptuskin 1985) a 
diffusive transport of high energy particles is likely up to distance of about 
10 kpc with typical mean diffusion coefficients of about ?~ ~ 1029cm2s -1. 
Summarizing the results of Breitschwerdt et al. (1991) it is possible to 
drive a supersonic mass loss from our Galaxy generated by the combined 
effect of cosmic rays and thermal pressure. The extragalactic pressure has to 
exceed nT 
,v 36 cm-3K to prevent the formation of an outflow. Integrating 
their typical values of the mass loss in each flux tube yields an upper limit for 
the total galactic mass loss rate of about )~/gal -~ 1 M®yr -1 for our galaxy. 
Assuming a life time of tgal - 101° years we get _~rgaitg,l - 101°M® -~ MmM, 
a value which is comparable to the numbers of Sect. 1.3 where the results 
from the diffuse "/-ray emission are discussed (before Table 3). It is also clear 
that the gas leaving the Milky Way is hot and affects the HIM as well as 
the overall chemical evolution of a galaxy since the rising gas comes mainly 
from SNe having a different chemical composition compared to the mean 
ISM. Chevalier & Oegerle (1979) argue on the other hand that the presence 
of clouds in the halo indicates that the energy input from SNe is lost due 
to radiation rather than used to power a galactic wind. However, up to now 
no clear observational indications can be collected to prove the existence of 
such galactic winds. Nevertheless, the obtained mass loss rates summed over 
the life time of a galaxy provide an important mass loss to the intergalactic 
medium. In the future a detailed calculation of the synchrotron emission 
from such cosmic ray driven halos could remove this uncertainty. 
2 Supernova Remnants 
As emphasized at several points in the previous section we have seen that 
SN-explosions are essential for controlling the overall properties of the ISM 
and since SN-explosions are the most violent events in our Galaxy the energy 
transferred to the ISM is also responsible for a large variety of individual 
phenomena. Therefore a more thorough theory of the evolution of a SNR 
has to be given in order to understand the dynamics of the ISM. On the 
other hand it should be clear that at this point we cannot be interested in 
modelling a particular event in great detail but have to consider the general 
features of SNR evolution. According to Woltjer (1972) the evolution of 
a SNR can basically be described by four phases depending on different 
physical processes relevant at each stage. The following sections are based 
on these distinctions but I have to mention that the transition between these 

84 
phases is accompanied with several rather complex dynamical phenomena 
propagating through the remnant (at least in spherical symmetry). 
From the observational facts SN-explosions are divided into two major 
classes depending whether hydrogen lines are absent (Type I ) or present 
(Type II ) in their spectra. The theoretical explanations for the distinct ex- 
plosion mechanisms can reveal these observational differences by either em- 
ploying a carbon deflagration of a white dwarf for Type I or a core collapse 
of a massive star with its hydrogen envelope for Type II (see e.g. the reviews 
by Woosley 1986, Woosley & Weaver 1986). However, in the present con- 
text I have to neglect these different classes of SNe and for our purposes 
the explosion energy will be set to the canonical number of ESN = 1051erg 
bearing in mind that some SNe can have energies less than this value. 
2.1 Free Expansion Phase 
The strong shock wave generated inside the star moves outwards and we 
expect some differences in the early stages of the explosion (e.g. in the light 
curve) depending on the stellar structure and on a possible stellar wind 
from the SN-progenitor. The stellar atmosphere can be approximated by a 
power law p o¢ r -n where n is 8 to 9 (e.g. Arnett 1987, 1988 in a model for 
SN1987A). The result of a SN-explosion is a free expansion with a simple 
velocity field given in Eq. (70) and after the shock wave has run through 
the atmosphere of the exploding star a characteristic flow pattern develops 
which can be seen schematically in Fig. 10 and as a result of numerical 
simulations in Fig. 11. A contact discontinuity CD separates the ejected 
material from the surrounding matter. A strong shock front $1 compresses 
the ISM and the so-called reverse shock $2 decelerates the ejecta. Note that 
the reverse shock is located in the SN-material and runs backwards in the 
expanding frame of the contact discontinuity. 
During this phase the external medium has no influence on the violent 
expansion of the shock wave because the pressure and the velocity of the 
ambient material are neglibile. In the case of spherically symmetric flows 
(considered throughout these sections) the density structure surrounding 
the SN p o¢ r -a is generally taken either to be constant, i]e. a = 0 or to be 
generated by a stellar wind of constant velocity and mass loss, i.e. a = 2. 
Since most of the SN-energy (except the emission of neutrinos) is kinetic 
energy we can relate the ejection velocity vej to the SN-energy ESN

Fig. 10. Schematic flow pattern of a SN exploding into a homogeneous medium 
Since we are mainly interested in the large scale evolution of a SNR and its 
influence on the ISM I will not discuss the possibility of clumped ejecta 
(e.g. Hamilton 1985) nor various self-similar solutions for young SNRs 
(e.g. Chevalier 1982, Nadyozhin 1985). The interaction of a stellar wind 
with the ambient medium creates a complicated flow structure contain- 
ing the wind bubble, shocked wind material and shocked ambient material 
(e.g. Weaver et ai. 1977). Assuming the SN-progenitor to be a red supergiant 
with a wind velocity of 10kms -1 and a mass loss rate of 2~/= 10-6M® yr -1 
a cavity of about 1 pc is formed in about 105 years containing 0.1 M®. Taking 
a typical density of 1 cm -3 the swept-up mass of the ambient medium is also 
about 0.1 M® in a bubble with a radius of 1 pc. In this case the disturbed 
medium is rather small in mass and radius compared to the subsequent 
evolution of a SNR. Therefore I will ignore this phase of the interaction of 
the SN-ejecta with the stellar wind and will consider for the rest of this 
chapter only explosions occurring in a medium of a mean constant density 
p0. Modifications caused by an inhomogeneous medium (embedded inter- 
stellar clouds) are discussed later (cf. Sect. 2.4.3) in the context of cloud 
evaporation or production of high energy "),-rays due to collisions of cosmic 
rays with the thermal plasma. 
The accumulated mass of the external homogeneous medium of density 
p0 compressed between the contact discontinuity and the forward shock 
equals the ejected mass Mej at a certain time and distance. This condition 
defines the sweep-up radius P~w as well as the sweep-up time tsw, i.e.

The results on SNR presented in the following sections are obtained by 
using a numerical method based on an adaptive grid which distributes the 
individual grid points at locations of strong gradients (Dorfi & Drury 1987). 
The equations of cosmic ray hydrodynamics (116)-(122) are discretized in a 
conservative and implicit form to ensure also numerically a conservation of 
global quantities like mass, momentum and energy and to avoid the restric- 
tive timestep condition necessary for explicit discretizations. To illustrate 
the obtainable resolution individual grid points of the flow region around 
the contact discontinuity are plotted in Fig. 11 showing the forward shock 
running in the ISM as well as the reverse shock located in the ejecta de- 
celerating them. Fig. lld depicts the relative grid spacing Ar/r where the 
three discontinuities are clearly resolved by a continuous decrease of the 
grid size. Note that this numerical treatment is independent of the physical 
processes involved in the transition region. More details on the numerical 
method applicable to SNRs axe given in Dorfi (1990 and references therein). 
The simple nature of such a freely expanding flow, i.e. u = r/t can also 
be inferred from Fig. 12 where the evolution of a SNR is displayed up to 
a time of 3250 years. At the end of this phase the reverse shock propagates 
inwards and heats up the interior. The initial stellar profile is advected 
outwards and is clearly seen in the density structure (Fig. 12a) where the 
density decreases like p c(t-3f(u) and the function f(u) depends on the 
initial conditions and the explosion mechanism. However, the last time step 
t --- 1.02 1011s shown in Fig. 12 indicates the end of the expansion phase 
because the velocity (Fig. 12b) becomes negative around 1.2 1019cm. The 
gas pressure in Fig. 12c exhibits the growing separation between the two 
shock waves because the reverse shock moves inwards. Since these models 
include also the acceleration of cosmic rays in shock waves Fig. 12d depicts 
the particle pressure Pc obtained for a constant mean cosmic ray diffusion 
coefficient of k = 1027cm 2 s -a and a cosmic ray adiabatic index of % = 4/3 
and an injection parameter of ~Tinj = 10 -3 (see Sect. 2.5 for a detailed 
discussion of these quantities). During the expansion phase the effects of 
cosmic rays are negligible due to the large thermal pressure and due to the

small volume occupied by these high energy particles although the cosmic 
ray pressure can be several orders of magnitude above the value in the 
ISM. The large value of ~ leads to a flat pressure structure in the interior 
of the SNR as long as the adiabatic expansion can be compensated by 
the diffusive flux. A typical expansion velocity of u ~- 10Skm s -1 and the 
diffusion coefficient of ~ define a length scale of ~¢/u ~- 101Scm where the 
adiabatic losses can be balanced by diffusion. However, smaller values of 
result in large gradients of cosmic rays in the interior of SNR during this 
expansion phase. Note that cosmic rays can influence the SNR evolution at 
late stages as demonstrated in the following sections. 
Around the time of tsw the flow structure changes due to the large 
amount of interstellar material that has been pushed away. The reverse 
shock starts travelling inwards and runs through the ejected material heat- 
ing up the interior to very high temperatures. This transition can be accom- 
panied by several running sound waves until a rather flat pressure distribu- 
tion is achieved and we have now a pressure driven expansion described in 
the next section. 
Note that a large number of young galactic SNR are observed during 
this free expansion phase. The well studied Cas A remnant shows freely 
expanding gas at a velociy of about 4000 km s -1 (e.g. Kamper 8z van den 
Bergh 1976) but also several knots with larger velocites are found within 
the remnant and their velocities scale also linearly with the distance from 
the center of the expansion indicating that they have not been decelerated 
significantly. Based on radio observations Bell (1977) deduces an upper limit 
of about 1700 km s -1 to the mean radial velocit:¢ but this velocity seems to 
belong to the gas shocked and slowed down by the reverse shock therefore 
having a smaller expansion rate. 
2.2 Sedov-Taylor Phase 
The further evolution is determined by the amount of interstellar gas swept 
up during the expansion phase. The energy remains constant and hence 
radiative losses are unimportant leading to an adiabatic evolutionary stage. 
An exact self-similar solution for such a pressure driven explosion has been 
given by Taylor (1950) and Sedov (1959) based on a rather cumbersome 
analytical treatment. However, the thin shell approximation introduced in 
Sect. 1.6.1 provides a much simpler estimate and Newton's second law gives

The acceleration of cosmic rays results in the development of a thick 
shell of energetic particles during the Sedov-Taylor phase as depicted in 
Fig. 13d. The region of enhanced cosmic ray intensity is confined to about 
0.75P~ containing about 60% of the SNR volume for times t ~ 10 tsw. The 
maximum cosmic ray pressure of about 12 Pc,ext is reached for the adopted 
value of k = 1025cm 2 s -1 at an age of 2 104 years. The expansion proceeds 
and the gas cools adiabatically according to Eq. (78). At a certain time tc 
the temperature will decreases below a critical value where radiative losses 
become important. 
Tycho's SNR is a well observed example of a Type I SN-explosion in the 
Sedov-Taylor phase. The explosion happened in the year 1572 and hence we

have now an age of t = 420 years. The proper motions of optical filaments 
have been studied by Kamper & van den Bergh (1978) and they identify a 
shock wave increasing with time like t' where y = 0.38 =k 0.01. This value is 
in close agreement to the theoretical value of 7/= 0.4 for an adiabatic blast 
wave. As discussed in Sect. 2.7 most of X-rays emitted during this stage are 
produced in the immediate postshock region. 
2.3 Cooling Phase 
Around the age of 104 years the temperature (79) is about 106K and the 
most abundant ionized elements start to capture free electrons and their sub- 
sequent excitation allows the energy to be effectively radiated away. This 
effect is visible in the large increase of the cooling function A(T) around 
10SK plotted in Fig. 2. Accordingly the thermal pressure in the postshock 
region decreases and a thin cool shell forms where the shocked gas comes 
almost at rest (shown in Fig. 14). At later times so-called secondary shocks 
(Falle 1975) are generated as a consequence of rapid cooling in the down- 
stream region (cf. also Sect. 2.7 for effects on the production of "r-quanta). 
The corresponding cooling time can be estimated analytically from the 
energy equation (Field 1965) 
dt 
and by introducing the cooling time t¢ we get 
3kT 
t¢ ~- 2nA(T----'~" 
(81) 
To calcualate the time when a thin shell forms we have to set the evolution 
time tayn equal to this cooling time, i.e. 
3kT(t¢) 
= ~tc 
(82) 
t¢ _ tdyn, 
2nA(T¢) = v--~ 
by use of Eq. (75). If we assume that the compression corresponds to a 
strong shock 7 = 5/3 and adopting simple Kahn's cooling law Eq. (11), 
n -- 4n0, 
A(T) = CT -1/2 
(83) 
Eq. (82) can be explicitly solved under the condition that the Sedov-Taylor

More accurate estimates on the cooling time and the formation of a dense 
shell axe due to Cox (1972) or Kahn (1976) yielding slightly different expo- 
nents. 
In the example of Fig. 14 the external density is set to no = 5cm -3, 
a value typical for Cas A leading to a significantly shorter sweep-up time 
of tsw = 1.47101% at a sweep-up radius of Rsw = 6.5810 is cm. The cor- 
responding cooling time can be calculated from Eq. (85) yielding tshell --~ 
2.68 lOlls. Note that in the evaluation of the cooling time tc (81) cosmic ray 
effects can be taken into account by increasing n, i.e. n = 7n0 for 3'¢ = 4/3 
which results in a smaller t¢ (see also Sect. 2.4.2). The radial dependence of 
the density, velocity, cosmic ray energy density and temperature is depicted 
in Fig. 14 for a radius interval between 1019cm and 102°cm. 
The curve labeled t = 2.05 1011s exhibits a compression ratio of r = 4 
and so neither radiative cooling nor cosmic rays modify the shock struc- 
ture at this time where the energies are divided up as Eth = 0.69EsN, 
Ekin = 0.28EsN, Eer = 0.02 ESN and E¢ool = 0.99EsN. The effects of cool- 
ing become more pronounced in the case of higher ambient densities since 
the radiated power depends on the density squared (cf. Eq. 10). The com- 
pression ratio increases to r = 7.9 (Fig. 14a) where the cooling sets in more 
effectively but we can still separate the shock front from the cooling zone in 
the downstream region. If we insert the value of no = 5cm -3 into Eq. (85) 
we estimate the radius Rshell --'~ 3.1 1019cm at which a dense shell forms. The 
good agreement of this value with the numerical calculations can be inferred 
from Fig. 14. The temperature structure clearly exhibits the shock with a 
downstream temperature of 6 105K decreasing to 2.2 105K in the cooling 
region (Fig. 14d). We get inward velocities for radii R < 1019cm (Fig. 14b). 
The cosmic ray precursor in the velocity can be seen in Fig. 14b growing 
in time. At t = 8.01 1011s a very dense shell is built up and the density 
increases up to r = 66.3 (Fig. 14a) with a postshock temperature of 5 10SK 
and a minimum of 8 103K in the cooling zone. I want to emphasize that the 
velocity jump in the postshock region is followed by a local minimum which 
both develop in time to a further secondary shock. This fact can be deduced 
from the cosmic ray structure (Fig. 14c) showing not only a single sharp 
peak like the one at earlier times. The time evolution of the cosmic ray ac- 
celeration depicts the growing precursor which is best detectable in veloc{t~r 
and cosmic ray energy. However, up to that age cosmic rays have only a 
small influence on the density and temperature structure in the upstream 
region. 
Note that at the time of tshen the interior of the remnant is still hot and 
cools adiabatically, i.e. for the remnants volume V

At this stage the remnant evolves by accumulating the swept-up material in 
the shell and no significant internal motions are expected. The ram pressure 
is then equal the internal pressure, i.e. 
p0v~ ~- P 
(87) 
and the SNR is entering the so-called snowplow phase where

2.4 Final SNR Evolution

Employing the last estimate (89) the final SNR radius can be obtained by 
setting the shock velocity vs to the mean ISM velocity ~ISM ~ VA,ext ~'~

Up to this stage the analytical description of a SNR exploding into a ho- 
mogeneous medium is summarized in Fig. 15. 
Spitzer (1978) has given an estimate how much kinetic energy of the 
SN can be converted into cloud motions when the clouds are pieces of the 
SNR shell breaking apart. Such a situation is very likely because the hotter 
and more tenuous interior pushes the dense cooling shell which leads to 
a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable configuration (e.g. Lamb 1945). Since the late 
phases are characterized by a conservation of the outward momentum we

Using Eq. (92) and 1/2Mtv2t ~ 1/4EsN for 7 = 5/3 we finally find 
Vc = 0.023 
(97) 
according to the following estimates. As pointed out in Sect. 1.3.2 the rms 
velocity of clouds is about ve ~ 8kms -1 (McKee & Ostriker 1977) and 
we fix the velocity vt by a typical temperature of 105 K appropriate for the 
momentum conserving phase and by Eqs. (79) which gives vt -~ 85.5 km s -1. 
Hence, at the end of the final SNR phases only about 0.023 ESN are needed 
to explain the typical rms velocities of interstellar clouds. The mass Me can 
be calculated form (95) yielding

2.4.2 Cosmic Pay Effects 
As shown in detail in the next sections cosmic ray effects are important at 
the late stages of SNR evolution. For this purpose we can redo the previous 
estimates assuming that the SNR is now dominated by high energy particles, 
i.e. 7 = 4/3 and a corresponding compression ratio in strong shock of r = 
7. Since the cooling time te (81) is sensitive to the density squared we 
expect the shell formation to happen at earlier times and smaller radii.

The numerical factors change by 0.82, 0.92 and 1.13 compared to the thermal 
case with ~ = 5/3. 
The final SNR radius is also affected by cosmic rays since the snowplow 
phase (Sect. 2.3) has a softer expansion law than Eqs. (86)-(89), i.e.

These numerical factors of (101) can be regarded as upper limits since we

2.4.3 Remarks on SNRs in inhomogeneous media 
As stated in the previous sections the ISM is far from being a homogeneous 
medium although the SNR models presented so far explode in constant 
surroundings. Most of the mass is contained in dense clouds (cf. Tables 1,2) 
occupying only small volumes whereas most of the volume is filled with 
hot but very tenuous gas (HIM). Hence, I will make some remarks on the 
evolution of a SNR in a cloudy medium but refer e.g. to McKee (1988) for 
a more profound discussion of this topic. 
An expanding SNR shock overtakes interstellar clouds of various sizes 
and drives a shock wave into them. Numerical simulations without embed- 
ded magnetic fields (Woodward 1976, Krebs & Hillebrandt 1983) as well 
as ones including a magnetic field (Nittman 1981, Oettl et al. 1985) clearly 
show the development of Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabili- 
ties although some of the results suffer from poor resolution of the grid used 
and/or numerical diffusion at the cloud-intercloud interface. A strong SNR 
shock with velocity vs hits a spherical cloud of density pd and radius Rd. 
Neglecting radiative effects the ram pressures must be comparable (McKee 
& Cowie 1975), i.e. pdv2s,cl ~ pov2s where vs,d is the shock speed in the cloud; 
thus 
( p__%~1/2 
Vs,cl "~ \pc1/

(102) 
The physical effects involved in this cloud crushing can be illustrated by 
defining three relevant time scales, namely the cloud crushing time tcc, the

having assumed a Sedov-Taylor expansion law (79). Since the density ratio 
between the clouds and the intercloud medium is usually large we expect 
tec > tic. Furtheron small, medium or large clouds can be distinguished 
(McKee 1988) depending on these time scales where small clouds (t > tcc) 
are compressed by the enclosing shock wave but large clouds (tie > t) are 
subject to smaller cloud shocks and the SNR shock weakens during the 
cloud passing time. The net acceleration of a cloud is made up by the ram 
pressure exerting a drag on the cloud as well as by the shock accelerating 
the gas. However, the ultimate stage of a cloud hit by a SNR shock is not 
well established since this non-linear interaction requires accurate multidi- 
mensional numerical simulations with sufficient resolution. Of course such 
simulations are essential to determine a shock induced collapse as well as 
subsequent star formation. 
The mentioned instabilities on the surface of these shocked clouds pro- 
vide a natural way of transferring mass from the clouds to the intercloud 
medium and this mass-loading can dramatically alter the dynamics of a 

99 
SNR. It is obvious that the cooling time (85) can give only an upper limit 
in such a case because a mass-loaded remnant cools earlier since the energy 
radiated away depends on the mean density squared. A similar effect comes 
from the evaporation of clouds embedded in a hot medium due to thermal 
conduction (McKee & Ostriker 1977). Without going too much in details 
it should be clear that a remnant with mass loading evolves different from 
those without but it is almost impossible to disentangle this effect observa- 
tionally from SNRs exploding into a medium stratified by the progenitors 
stellar wind. However, more refined observational techniques in the "/-range 
may provide better resolved observations if enough cosmic rays are acceler- 
ated at the SNR shock. These particles collide with the dense clouds and 
therefore produce neutral pions which decay and become visible as local 
regions of enhanced 7-ray emission (cf. Sect. 2.7). 
2.5 Particle Acceleration in SNR's 
As pointed out in the previous sections cosmic rays lead to several effects 
during the SNR evolution but the solutions presented so far are based on 
the simplifying assumption that % and k are taken to be constant. Hence 
this section is devoted to numerical simulations where the time-dependence 
of the acceleration process in SNR's is discussed in more detail. Such calcu- 
lations are necessary to determine the amount of SN-energy ESN converted 
into energetic particles and hence how much energy is still available for 
producing the HIM. 
2.5.1 Cosmic Ray Hydrodynamcis 
This sections deals with the basic equations describing cosmic rays as a 
fluid, i.e. cosmic ray hydrodynamics. Starting from the cosmic ray transport 
equation (Skilling 1975) for the particle distribution function f(r, p, t) 
of 
1,. 
of 
0---/+ u.Vf = V.(~Vf) + 5v.Up~pp

Pc = -~

(105)

Ec = 47r 
p2T(p)f(p)dp 
where v(p) is the particle velocity and T(p) the particle kinetic energy. By 
taking a moment of the transport equation (104) we obtain a hydrodynam- 
ical equation for the cosmic rays

It is clear that the internal energy density is related to the pressure through 
an adiabatic exponent 4/3 < 7~ < 5/3 of the cosmic rays 
PC=(% - 1)E¢. 
(108) 
Note that the cosmic ray quantities ~ and % have now to be specified during 
the SNR evolution. 
Another problem comes from the injection of energetic particles in shock 
waves as seen also in the bow shock of the earth (e.g. Lee 1983). There is no 
quantitative theory available for this complicated process and the injection 
is usually treated by introducing an injection flux across the shock front

where r/inl denotes the fraction of the kinetic energy flux dissipated and put 
to high energy particles. From solar wind observations the typical values of 
r/inj are in the range from 10 -4 up to 10 -2. 
As a first step we can take the mean effective diffusion coefficient ~ of 
cosmic rays as well as the adiabatic coefficient % to be constant and some 
results of such SNR cMculations for different values of ~, 7c and r/inj are 
shown in Table 5. The time is given in units of tsw = 3.75 101%.

However, as pointed out by Achterberg et al. (1984) and Heavens (1984a) 
the values of ~ and % cannot be assigned in a simple way to certain numbers 
but they are time-dependent functions as long as particle acceleration pro- 
ceeds in a SNR. Due to variations in the contributions from non-relativistic 
and relativistic cosmic rays this time-dependence has to be considered if 
the amount of SN-energy converted to energetic particles is extracted from 
SNR evolutionary simulations. Therefore the next section is devoted to the 
time-dependence of shock acceleration. 
2.5.2 Time-dependent Effects in Cosmic Ray Shocks 
In the case of effective particle acceleration we expect that the energetic par- 
ticles can totally smooth the shock structure. Therefore only an adiabatic 
compression is left for the gas as shown in Fig. 7 (Sect. 1.4.3). Such shock 
transitions occur also in SNRs if particle acceleration becomes very effective. 
In addition to this smoothing of the shock we expect a time-dependence of 
quantities related to cosmic rays like the mean cosmic ray diffusion coeffi- 
cient ~ and the adiabatic index %. Since the time-dependence of ~ and 7c 
during the SNR evolution can exactly be calculated only from the full cos- 
mic ray transport equation (104) we can introduce an approximate theory 
(Drury et al. 1989) to determine ~ and 7¢ and still use the simpler moment 
equation (106). These estimates are based on the so-called test particle pic- 
ture in plane geometry where the reactions of the cosmic rays on the thermal 
flow are neglected. An important result obtained in the test particle picture 
is the cut-off momentum pmax(t) of accelerated particles 
dpmax = Pmax 
(110)

where the acceleration time Tact in a shock wave with the upstream values

Another estimate is employed to relate the momentum-dependent diffusion 
coefficient n(p) to the mean diffusion coefficient ~ of Eq. (107) needed in 
cosmic ray hydrodynamics. We adopt a fully developed turbulence and can 
therefore apply the Bohm-limit for a particle with mass m and charge Ze, 
i.e. 
1 mc 3 
(p/me) 2 
(11_o) 
~(P) = 3 ZeB V/1 + (p/mc)2" 
If the mean diffusion coefficient g is dominated by the highest particle mo- 
menta and if the spatial dependence in Eq. (107) can be ignored the following 
ansatz is quite plausible 

102 
1 
= 5ka(pm~x), 
5k = max(3,1n(pm~x/mc)' 
(113) 
since 5k can be estimated reasonable well (Drury et al. 1989). 
The next step includes the determination of 7¢ which should clearly be 
bound between 4/3 <_ 7¢ -< 5/3. Here the energetic particles are divided into 
a non-relativistic and a relativistic part, where the non-relativistic particle 
energy Ec,n is given by the amount of injected particles at the shock wave 
and the advected energy into the shock

E~,0 and %,0 denote the upstream values advected into the shock. The 
last expression includes the injected particle spectrum finj(P) ranging from 
the injection momentum Pin5 up to momentum mc which is used to define 
the upper limit of the integral. Note that this assumption relies also on 
Pmax > inc. The rest of the local cosmic ray energy must be contained in 
relativistic particles and we get

and set % = 5/3 in the case of Ec,n > Ec. Starting without accelerated 
particles ~c is equal to 5/3 but decreases when the particle pressure is built 
up and levels at 4/3 if Ec,n << Ec- The analysis of Blandford (1980) shows 
that a simple power-law with index 4 < q < 5 without cut-offs yields the 
remarkable result of % = q/3 and hence we may conclude that the approx- 
imation (115) to the full particle distribution function catches the essential 
physics. 
In Fig. 16 a typical solution of the above system of equations is presented 
including the aforementioned time-dependence of % and ~, no cooling, no 
dissipation of Alfv6n waves, i.e. O/H = 0 and injection of particles at the 
shock with qinj = 10 -4. As mentioned earlier a transition happens from gas 
dominated to cosmic ray dominated shocks before the Sedov-phase begins. 
Hence, this process also occurs in spherical calculations if the cosmic ray 
pressure exceeds a certain level which is almost independent of the detailed 
knowledge of the particle distribution function. Figure 16 plots the different 
energy contributions in units of the initial explosion energy ESN between 
101°s and 8 101%. At about 3 101% we see a rapid increase of the cosmic 
ray energy Ecr and at t = 1.3 10ns the reverse shock changes the kinetic, 
thermal and cosmic ray energies. Note that most of the supernova energy 
is transferred to high energy particles and after about 1012s the total cos- 
mic ray energy Ecr stays almost at a level of about 0.7EsN. SNR models

with constant values of 7c and ~ do not give such high cosmic ray effects 
(cf. Table 5) although the injection of energetic particles at the shock front 
has been included in some models. From this particular example we clearly 
see the importance of a time-dependent and careful treatment of 7c and 
which is necessary to simulate more realistic SNR's. This result exhibits a 
very efficient conversion of the supernova explosion energy into high energy 
particles. However, these high cosmic ray energy densities accompanied with 
low plasma temperatures have to be compared to observational constraints, 
in particular to the X-ray luminosities of young remnants (cf. Sect. 2.6). 
Adopting such an amount of E~r we may conclude that the estimate (32,33) 
on the power needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray energy density 
can easily be fulfilled and that the bulk of the galactic cosmic rays can be 
produced by SNR's (cf. Blandford & Ostriker 1980). 
The maximum particle momentum Pm~x is plotted in Fig. 16b in units 
of mc where three phases can be distinguished. A more detailed descrip- 
tion of this plot is necessary since Pm~x is related to g (113) which controls 
the diffusive losses to the interior of the expanding remnant. At the begin- 
ning t -~ 106s we have a rapid increase of Pmax until n(pmax) is of the order 
of vsR~. Secondly, we find an almost linear increase of Pm~x with time while 
the remnant remains in free expansion. Thirdly, we have the transition to 
the Sedov-phase after about 10ns where Pm~x remains almost constant. For 
these computations we have assumed a magnetic field of B = 5 #G and 
have scaled Bcx p]/2 which is equivalent to keeping the Alfv6n velocity Vh 
constant. The maximum particle energy corresponds to Cpm~x = 9.3 1013eV. 
The ratio of the particle pressure to the total pressure P~/(P~ + Pg) at 
the shock front is plotted in Fig. 16c showing a variation over several orders 
of magnitude during the SNR lifetime. Self-similar solutions for SNR's with 
cosmic rays obtained by Chevalier (1983) have to assume that this quantity 
is kept constant throughout the entire evolution which is clearly not the 
case. This indicates some limitations of such analytical solutions if non- 
linear particle acceleration in shock waves plays an important role. 
2.5.3 Evolution of SNR's with radiative cooling and particle 
acceleration 
Having discussed most of the input physics to characterize the evolution of 
SNR's with ongoing particle acceleration I want to summarize the simplest 
system of differential equations together with the relations for ~(t) and 7c(t) 
and show several examples. The evolution of a spherical SNR is described by 
the usual two-fluid equations of one-dimensional cosmic ray hydrodynamics. 
The gas density is denoted by p, the velocity by u, the gas pressure by Pg. We 
have to specify the two energy equations including also radiative equilibrium 
cooling/:(p, Es) due to lines and bremsstrahlung (cf. Fig. 2, but/:(p, Eg) is 
now written as a function of Eg and not T), heating caused by dissipation 

105 
of Alfv6n waves (cf. Sect. 1.6.2) as well as the injection of particles at the 
shock front Rs. This effect is parameterized by the term Rc,inj where a small 
fraction Yinj of the incoming kinetic energy is carried off by the cosmic rays 
(e.g. Drury, 1983).

(119) 
The system is closed by the equations of state for the thermal plasma

Pg = (Tg - 1)Zg, 
7g = ] 
(120) 
and for the cosmic rays where %(t) is defined by (115) 
Pc = (%(t) - 1)E¢. 
(121) 
Equations (118) and (119) contain the injection term Rc,inj which denotes 
the fraction of kinetic energy dissipated per second into cosmic rays and is 
therefore given by 
Rc,inj = r/injV- 
U 
. 
(122) 
This energy injection rate added to the cosmic ray energy density Ec at the 
location of shock fronts/~ has to be subtracted from the energy equation of 
the background gas (118) to guarantee the conservation of the total energy. 
Integration of (122) over an infinitely small volume around the shock front 
leads to the flux of energetic particles injected at the shock front given in 
Eq. (109). Typical values of ~inj are in the range of [0, 10 -2] (cf. Drury et 
el, 1989 for some discussion of different injection terms). 
The effect of dissipation of Alfv~n waves is parameterized by aH and we 
take ~H = 1 in the case of Alfv~nic heating. The dependence of the solu- 
tions on aH is explored by Markiewicz et el. (1990) in the ease of simplified 
SNR models. Hydromagnetic waves are generated by a resonant instability 
(Lerche 1967, Wentzel 1968, Kulsrud & Pearce 1969) if the energetic par- 
ticles show a sufficiently strong anisotropy in the frame of the background 
plasma. This can happen through a streaming caused by a cosmic ray gra- 
dient along the magnetic field. Under many circumstances these magnetic 
fluctuations may grow and become comparable to the average magnetic field 

106 
(McKenzie ~ V/51k 1982) and so no general theory exists beyond quasi-linear 
approximations. However, assuming strong damping of the waves the dissi- 
pation of the fluctuations leads to a heating of the thermal plasma which 
can be modelled by an extra term proportional to vAVPc acting in the 
precursor region of the forward shock (VSlk et al. 1984). 
Some typical solutions of the system (116)-(122) are shown in the fol- 
lowing figures (17,18,19). The SN explodes into a homogeneous medium and 
modifications of the external medium due to a possible stellar wind from a 
SN-progenitor are not taken into account. The supernova explosion energy 
is set to ESN = 1051erg, the ejected mass to Me = 5M®. The external 
density of no = 0.3 cm -3 and the temperature of To = 8000 K correspond 
to the usual WIM parameter (cf. Table 2). 
The time evolution of the different energy contributions is displayed on 
a linear scale up to 7 105yr in Fig. 17. Note that the radial structure in the 
vicinity of the shock waves is plotted in Figs. 18 and 19. Unfortunately, the 
final amount of cosmic rays accelerated in the expanding SNR depends on 
the injection of particles at the shock waves and hence I intend to discuss 
two extreme cases, one with almost no cosmic rays and another one where 
a large fraction of the SN-energy is put into energetic particles showing the 
possible range of different but homogeneous SNR's. 
The case depicted in Fig. 17a is characterized by a low conversion ef- 
ficiency from the explosion energy ESN to the total cosmic ray energy Ecr 
and Ecr stays below 0.04 ESN during the entire evolution. Cooling effects 
become important after 4.24104 years according to (85). I emphasize the 
importance of radiative cooling where most of the SNR thermal energy con- 
tent is already radiated away after about 5 104 years and E~oo] denotes the 
remaining SNR energy. Fig. 17b exhibits the temporal dependence of the 
energies in the case of a more efficient cosmic ray production. This model 
includes also heating of Alfv~n waves in the precursor region of the for- 
ward shock which yields an increase of the thermal energy Eth although 
radiative cooling decreases the total energy of the remnant. The injection 
of particles at the shock wave is given by the fraction r/inj = 10 -3 of the 
incoming kinetic energy carried off by cosmic rays. For the larger values of 
Ec~ (cf. Fig. 17b) cooling becomes important at earlier times because the 
thermal gas remains cooler during the Sedov-phase. We can estimate the 
onset of cooling at 3.4 104 years but Ecool decreases more slowly in time 
compared to Fig. 17a. 
The shock structure of the low cosmic ray case (Fig. 17a) is explored 
in the shock frame on a linear scale between 0.8/~ and 1.3/~ in Fig. 18. 
As a consequence of cooling the density (Fig. 18a) is enhanced by a factor 
of 30 at t = 4.01 1011s associated with Ecoo] = 0.41EsN and a postshock 
velocity of 80 km s -1 (Fig. 18b). The cosmic ray pressure suppresses higher 
compression ratios because the total postshock pressure cannot drop below 
the level of Pc. Since a number of particles is accelerated at the shock

this is an effective mechnanism to avoid catastrophic cooling (Falle 1975, 
1981). The small temperature peak demonstrates the importance of cooling 
and during the depicted time interval the temperature varies less than a 
factor of two across the shock. The radial increase of the temperature in the 
postshock region is caused by hot gas which is left over from gas shocked 
at earlier times. The low densities prohibit a more rapid cooling since the 
density drops by about a factor of 20 compared to the external density. 
This density drop represents the contact discontinuity between the ejected 
stellar material and the shocked ISM (see also Fig. 12 in Sect. 2.1) yielding 
a slower cooling rate by a factor of 202. However, I emphasize that a cooling 
front is moving inwards seen in this shock frame. At t = 4.01 10ns the 
cooling front is located at 0.99R~ decreasing to 0.97R~ at t = 7.02 10a2s, 
to 0.94Rs at t -- 1.08 10a3s and to 0.87Rs at an age of t = 2.071013s. The 
variations in the cold downstream region are due to cosmic ray gradients 
and at the time of t = 2.071013s the cosmic rays show a second peak 
around 0.88P~ = 1.54 10~°cm produced by a secondary shock which rises 
the temperature of the tenuous interior from 104K to about 105K. 
Radiative cooling alters also the radial structure in the cooling region 
behind the forward shock which leads to the development of so-called sec- 
ondary shocks (Falle 1975, 1981). Including the acceleration of energetic 
particles we have an additional pressure which limits catastrophic cooling 
even more efficient when a large number of cosmic rays is produced. In this 
case also a smooth expansion of the forward shock is expected (cf. Fig. 7, 
Sect. 1.4.3). In Fig. 19 we present the density a), the velocity b), the cos- 
mic ray energy c) and the gas temperature d) in the shock frame for the 
model depicted also in Fig. 17b. Note that the cosmic ray pressure inside 
the remnant is about two orders of magnitude above the external value. 
The density in units of the external density of no = 0.3 cm -3 reveals the 
increase by cooling but also a cosmic ray precursor in front of the shock. 
The temperature (Fig. 19d) exhibits the almost isothermal shock wave and 
the cooling front moving inwards relative to the shock frame can be easily 
traced. Note also the density enhancement due to cooling and the occur- 
rence of complicated structures in the downstream region of the shock wave 
which yield also fluctuations in the collisional production of neutral pions 
and the associated 7-ray fluxes (cf. Sect. 2.7). 
Although large compression ratios are observed in the downstream re- 
gions all computations carried out so far show that the compression ratio r 
in the radiative shock wave remains below r < 70 limited by the down- 
stream cosmic ray pressure avoiding the situation of catastrophic cooling. 
The postshock velocity is still of the order of 100km s -1 showing a small 
cosmic ray precursor growing in time (cf. Fig. 19b). The last figures explore 
that radiative cooling as well as Alfv~nic heating are important to determine 
the amount of ESN which can be converted into cosmic rays. The effects of 
radiative cooling alter the overall energetics of a SNR but between 10% and

30% of the initial explosion energy ESN is converted to high energy particles 
and can explain the power needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray en- 
ergy density. The production of cosmic rays leads to lower temperatures and 
consequently radiative cooling is already important at earlier times during 
the SNR evolution. Although radiative cooling is relevant for the thermal 
structure of the remnant the motion of the shock wave is also influenced 
by the cosmic ray pressure (cf. Figs. 18,19). Several small scale structures 
(secondary shocks) are created in the downstream region and pushed by 
the pressure of the high energy particles, causing fluctuations of the down- 
stream cosmic ray pressure. In the cases of large amounts of cosmic rays the 
energy can be returned to the thermal gas and cooling acts indirectly on the 
cosmic rays (cf. Fig. 17b). Hence, the thermal energy content of the remnant 
can remain almost constant during the cooling phase because heating due 
to dissipation of Alfv~n waves transfers energy back to the thermal plasma 
from the cosmic ray energy gained in the Sedov-phase. I also want to stress 
that radiative cooling and acceleration of cosmic rays in shock waves need 
accurate numerical methods to resolve the physical length scales in order to 
obtain correct results. 
2.6 X-ray Emission from SNR's 
Many SNR's are prominent X-ray sources which reveal several properties of 
the evolution of the remnant itself as well as of the interstellar environment 
since a thermal plasma at temperatures around 106K emits in the X-ray 
range. During the entire evolution SNR's contain hot gas radiating at X- 
ray temperatures. Recently, a compilation of the X-ray surface brightness 
of 47 galactic SNR's has been published based on the observations of the 
Einstein Observatory (Seward 1990). Since the plasma is heated by several 
shock waves other non-thermal processes occurring at the shock transition 
can alter the amount of explosion energy transferred into the radiating gas. 
In the case of the Tycho remnant Heavens (1984b) has discussed the con- 
traints on the efficiency of generating cosmic rays in shock waves based on 
such arguments. Moreover, the cosmic ray precursor leads to an adiabatic 
heating of the incoming plasma in the precursor region and this effect has 
been invoked to explain some observed X-ray halos around SNR's (Morrill 
et al. 1984). 
However, the purpose ot this section is not to describe a particular rem- 
nant in detail but to show a number of global consequences of the acceler- 
ation process on the overall X-ray emission. In general differences caused 
by particle acceleration are expected only after t ~ tsw looking at the time 
scales of the acceleration process (cf. Table 5, Eqs. 111). Therefore older 
remnants will exhibit differences depending on particle acceleration and for 
these older remnants we expect a relevant influence of the structure of the 
ambient medium on the X-ray appearence. Moreover, if cooling becomes 

112 
important instabilities will develop changing more and more the spherical 
shape of the remnant which has been assumed in these calculations. Hence, 
to study the effects of particle acceleration on the emission of X-rays possi- 
bly leading to observable effects we have to follow the evolution of a SNR 
throughout the cooling phase (Sect. 2.3) up to the time where the expan- 
sion velocity becomes comparable to the typical velocities encountered in 
the surrounding interstellar medium. As inferred from the Figures 17,18,19 
(Sect. 2.5.3) cosmic rays limit the pressure drop in the cooling postshock 
region. In numerical simulations of SNR's with cooling but without particle 
acceleration (Falle 1975, 1981) a magnetic field has been included which is 
dynamically unimportant until the thermal gas cools thereby compressing 
the magnetic field. As a consequence the magnetic pressure inhibits a further 
collapse of the cooling region. In a study of SNR's in M33 Blair et al. (1981) 
have found evidence for a limited compression ratio which can be attributed 
to such magnetic fields but also to the pressure of the high energy particles 
accelerated at the shock waves (Chevalier 1983, Dorfi 1991). Up to now no 
direct observational evidences for shock acceleration of particles other than 
electrons have been detected in SNR's. The production of relativistic elec- 
trons is seen through synchrotron emission in a broad frequency range. Since 
we are mainly interested in the overall changes of the X-ray emission due to 
particle acceleration we can assume the same chemical abundances across 
the whole remnant neglecting the differences in the cooling curves depending 
on the chemical composition (e.g. BShringer ~ Hensler 1989). As mentioned 
before a detailed modelling of a certain remnant should take into account 
such chemical changes as well as time-dependent ionization processes but 
for exploring general features of the influence of particle acceleration on the 
X-ray luminosites we can ignore these differences. 
If the acceleration is effective the energy dissipated in the shock waves is 
converted into energetic particles and hence the thermal gas remains cooler 
resulting in a softer X-ray radiation. This distinct thermal history of the 
shocked gas also leads to a different X-ray history which can be traced 
in the spatial X-ray structure of a remnant. Again, the two extreme cases 
concerning the amount of production of cosmic rays of Fig. 17 are discussed 
in more detail. The first model (case a) describes the evolution of a SNR 
where most of the kinetic energy is transferred to the thermal energy of the 
plasma and the total cosmic ray energy stays below 0.07ESN. The second 
model (case b) corresponds to an extreme case where up to 0.6 ESN of the 
explosion energy is used to accelerate cosmic rays. For both cases the radial 
dependence of the physical variables has been shown in the previous section. 
The associated ~'-ray fluxes due to the decay of neutral pions continuously 
produced are depicted in the next section. 
The case of larger amounts of cosmic rays (Fig. 20) shows a similar 
X-ray spectrum compared to the case of low cosmic ray production (not 
shown here) for evolutionary times less than the sweep-up time. The dif-

ferent radial distribution of hot gas can already be seen at /?~ = 4.9 pc. 
Since a large fraction of the explosion energy is converted into high energy 
particles the remnant stays cooler as can be inferred from the X-ray spec- 
tra of Fig. 20b,c,d. Note that already at * = 4.26 10 3 yr and Rs = 8.9 pc a 
notable fraction of 106K-plasma exists in this case and becomes even more 
prominent in Fig. 20c through the X-ray lines around 70 eV. In contrast 
to the low cosmic ray case no important high temperature plasma is pro- 
duced in this remnant. The feature at 35 - 50 eV points at a thermal gas 
of 105K. However, in the interior we find a very tenuous hot plasma which 
cannot significantly contribute to the X-ray emission. In addition radiative 
losses are important already at earlier times (cf. Fig. 17) and the maximum 
in the X-ray flux is located at * = 3.24104 yr with an expansion radius of 
P~ = 19.5 pc plotted in Fig. 20e. Note that this maximum is less by a fac- 
tor of about 5 compared to the case of low cosmic rays and occurs about 
two times earlier in the evolution of the remnant. The subsequent phases 
exhibit again rather similar X-ray spectra although the absolute flux level 
decreases as the remnant expands. In general the main difference caused 
by the acceleration of cosmic rays becomes visible as a spectral feature in 
X-rays typically in the range above i keV. 
The late phases of/~ = 39.9pc and P~ = 49.9pc of Figs. 20g,h are 
characterized again by comparable X-ray spectra relative to the case of low 
cosmic rays but the emissivity is lower by at least an order of magnitude. 
The cosmic ray energy equation (119) used in this model of a SNR contains 
also the dissipation of Alfv&nic fluctuations in regions of large cosmic ray 
gradients which leads to a heating of the thermal plasma in the precursor 
region of the forward shock. We can state that only warm gas is produced 
not able to radiate significantly at X-ray wavelengths although this Alfvdnic 
heating enhances the total thermal energy of the remnant. Some secondary 
shocks triggered by gradients of cosmic rays in the downstream region are 
more frequent than in the low cosmic ray cases but they do not heat the 
thermal gas enough to increase the X-ray flux in the interior of the remnant. 
Fig. 21 shows the theoretical appearance of the two typical remnants 
(cf. Fig. 17) if they were observed with the PSPC instrument on board of 
ROSAT (e.g. Triimper 1983) which is sensitive between 0.1 keV and 2keV 
and has an effective detector area of about 220 cm 2 at 1 keV. The observed 
luminosities are scaled to a source distance of d = 1 kpc and I have assumed 
a low column density of hydrogen of nH= 102°cm -2 along the line of sight. 
Note that the dip in the calculated ROSAT-spectra around 0.g keV is due 
to an absorption at the entrance window of the PSPC. All curves are la- 
beled with the shock radius/~. As stated before the observable difference 
only becomes visible for shock radii P~ ~ P~w. Hence, comparing Fig. 21a 
vs. Fig. 21b the theoretical ROSAT-spectra at /~ = 2 pc are identical but 
exhibit an increasing diversity as the remnant expands. At /~ = 16.7pc 
(cf. Fig. 21a) we still see a significant contribution from hot gas at energies

above I keV in the case of low cosmic rays. A remnant with an effective cos- 
mic ray production does not exhibit this amount of hot gas at P~ = 16.5 pc 
(cf. 21b). Such a difference remains valid at all later expansion phases, 
e.g. Rs = 29.9 pc but the X-ray flux level can be shifted down by a factor 
up to 20 if cosmic rays are accelerated. Again, this can easily be seen from 
the lowest curves of Fig. 21a,b labeled by Rs = 50pc and P~ = 49.9pc 
where the latter model has a theoretical ROSAT-luminosity of less than 
10-15erg s-lkeV -1 above 0.5 keV. 
The evolution of the X-ray flux and the ROSAT-luminosity in the energy 
range between 0.1keV and 2.4keV is depicted as a function of time in 
Fig. 22, again normalized to a source distance of d = 1 kpc. The two curves 
correspond to the two remnants differing by the production of energetic 
particles. As explained in the previous sections cosmic rays alter the shock 
structure and the associated temperature structure only after t ~ tsw or in 
this case t ~ 101as. At this age the remnant of case b) (effective cosmic ray 
acceleration) starts already cooling, increasing the X-ray flux in the ROSAT 
sensitivity range. The maximum is reached at about 51011s whereas the case 
with no significant cosmic rays (case a, upper curve at late times) exhibits 
its maximum around 1.21012s which is a factor of 4 more luminous than 
case b). After that event both X-ray luminosities decrease almost parallel as 
seen in Fig. 22a, i.e. t ~ 1012s and the relative difference is given by about a 
factor of 20. Qualitatively the same behaviour can be observed in ROSAT- 
luminosity of Fig. 22b but the folding of the theoretical X-ray spectra with 
• the spectral sensitivity of the ROSAT PSPC leads to some differences in 
the time interval between 10ns and 1012s due to the very different radial 
structure of gas temperatures (cf. Figs. 18,19). 
This difference in the efficiency of particle acceleration can be traced 
indirectly in the X-rays originating from the thermal plasma. However, the 
diversity of SNR's and of the surrounding interstellar medium necessitates a 
detailed modelling of each individual remnant before definite conclusions on 
the efficiency of particle acceleration can be drawn from the observations of 
X-ray fluxes. Since the X-ray fluxes depend on the particle acceleration these 
effects also alter the X-ray statistics of SNRs as well as the contribution of 
the galactic X-ray background because if a thermal plasma is Heated up to 
X-ray emitting temperatures by shock waves cosmic rays are accelerated at 
the same astrophysical site changing thereby the shock structure. 
2.7 Gamma-ray Emission from SNR's 
Most of the 7-rays above 100 MeV are due to the decay of neutral pions 
created by collisions of cosmic ray protons in the energy range between 
1 MeV and 30 MeV with the thermal plasma (e.g. Stecker 1973, Stephens 
& Badhwar 1981). Contributions by bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton 
scattering of cosmic electrons are important for the production of "y-rays at

energies lower than 100 MeV. These three processes produce different 7-ray 
spectra and so their relative contributions can be calculated if the physical 
conditions of the galactic environment are known. The observations of cos- 
mic electrons are affected at lower energies by solar wind modulation (for 
bremsstrahlung). At higher energies the inverse Compton scattering lies out- 
side the frequencies which can be observed by earth-bound radio telescopes. 
Therefore the spectrum of cosmic electrons is poorly known (e.g. Kniffen & 
Fichtel 1981) and consequently the contribution of the two latter processes 
to the gamma luminosity of our galaxy is not well determined (e.g. Sacher 
~¢ Schhnfelder 1983 and Sect. 1.3). The acceleration of high energy parti- 
cles is therefore closely connected to the production of 7-ray photons above 
100 MeV. Collisions of the cosmic ray protons with the thermal plasma cre- 
ate neutral pions decaying into observable "/-quanta. Hence, the observed 
3'-ray flux above 100 MeV depends on the cosmic ray energy density times 
the gas density. 
When calculating the 7-ray luminosities from 7r°-decay in SNR's it is 
in particular important to include radiative cooling of the thermal plasma 
which leads to higher gas densities and consequently also to enhanced 7-ray 
fluxes. Since we are working on the hydrodynamical level (c.f. Sect. 2.5.1) 
the particle distribution function is averaged out leaving no information on 
the resulting cosmic ray spectrum as well as on the neutral pion spectrum 
created by collisions. But in a simple estimate of the 7-luminosity of a SNR 
producing cosmic rays we can assume a particle spectrum similar to the 
observed one and calculate a yielding factor q7 = 1.4 10-13cm3erg-ls -1 for 
the production of 7-rays above 100 MeV by 7r°-decay (Higdon & Lingenfelter 
1975) and can convert the energy density of the cosmic rays into a 7-ray 
flux above 100 MeV. 
To evaluate the total 7-ray flux from the expanding shock wave we have 
to integrate over the remnant

where P~ denotes the radius of the shock front, d the distance to the SNR, 
n the gas number density and Ec the cosmic ray energy density. In the 
case of a cosmic ray precursor we calculate the integral "/-ray flux F-I, p 
up to the radius of the precursor Rp where the cosmic ray energy den- 
sity Ec declines to the value of 1/e compared to the maximum located at 
the shock front. Hence, the two upper curves in each plot correspond to 
the v-ray fluxes integrated up to the shock radius Rs or the radius of the 
precursor Rp. The lower curves give the amount of 3'-ray flux expected from 
a bubble of radius R~ filled with the interstellar cosmic ray energy den- 
sity E~,0 (cf. Eq. 29) and thermal gas no describing the ambient medium, 
i.e. F-~,b(t) = 47r/3noE~,oR~(t). During the Sedov-Waylor phase (79) we 

119 
therefore have FT,b(t ) oct 6/g. Note that in Figs. (23) and (24) these v-ray 
fluxes are normalized to a source distance of d = 1 kpc. 
Fig. 23a is typical for the case where a smM1 fraction of ESN is con- 
verted to cosmic rays. The ?-ray flux FT,s within the shock radius does not 
differ from the 7-ray flux within the precursor FT, p because no significant 
modifications of the shock front are present up to the time when cooling 
becomes important (85) and a dense shell is formed. In this case at the time 
of t = 4.05 1011S a strong secondary shock is clearly visible triggered by ra- 
diative cooling which decreases the cosmic ray energy density as well as the 
gas density in the vicinity of the forward shock yielding also a lower ")'-ray 
flux FT,s. At the time of 1.6105years the "y-ray fluxes (Fig. 23a) reach their 
maximum of FT,s = 3.310-Sphcm-2s-1 and F~,p = 3.610-Sphcm-2s -1 
decreasing towards 2 10-Sph cm-2s -1 at 6.5 105years and Rs = 56.8 pc. 
In the case of higher cosmic ray pressures (cf. Fig. 23b) we get an en- 
hancement of the 7-ray fluxes already at earlier times around 2104years 
but small scale shock waves in the downstream region cause more visible 
fluctuations on the ~r°-production because the cooler gas is pushed more eas- 
ily by the cosmic ray pressure gradients. The larger difference of Fig. 23b 
between the FT,p- and F.~,s-fluxes compared to Fig. 23a is due to the im- 
portant contribution of creating neutral pions in the precursor region of the 
forward shock. This model includes Alfv@nic heating in the precursor region 
(cf. Fig. 17b) and hence we observe a faster decrease of the "/-ray flux in time 
relative to Fig. 23a because cosmic ray energy is transferred to the thermal 
plasma. On the other hand the shock radius/~(t) is a smooth function of 
time for both models as can be derived from the lowest curves in Figs. 23a,b, 
denoting the background flux FT,b of 7-rays. From this fact we can conclude 
that radiative cooling does not affect the motion of the shock front com- 
pared to simulations without cosmic rays (Falle 1975, 1981). The evolution 
of the 7-ray flux is calculated up to the age of 106 years when the SNR has 
reached a radius of 73.4 pc and the shock velocity has dropped to 30 km s -1 
differing by less than a factor of two compared to the final SNR radius (91). 
The v-ray flux decreases at that time to about FT,s = 410-Sph cm-~s -1. 
In Figure 24 the distribution of the energies in units of ESN as well as 
the 7-ray fluxes FT,s and FT,p above 100 MeV are shown for a SN explod- 
ing into a homogeneous medium with an ambient density of no = 5 cm -3. 
The sweep-up time (72) is given in this case by tsw = 1.47101% corre- 
sponding to 466 years. Radiative cooling effects become important already 
after 8490 years (85). In this case we can distinguish three reverse shocks 
occurring at 790, 1050 and 2640 years until the transition from the free ex- 
pansion to the pressure driven Sedov-Taylor phase is accomplished. At the 
later time of 12840 yr a more pronounced secondary shock wave is running 
inwards and reducing the 7-ray fluxes FT,s and FT, p. Between this event and 
25400years the compression ratio increases from r = 7.9 to its maximum 
value of r = 66.3. Further in time several smaller secondary shocks lead to

variations in the 7-ray fluxes at level of a few percents. The higher ambient 
density is also responsible for increased 7-ray fluxes which level at about 
10-6phcm-2s -1 for ages later than 5104 years although the total cosmic 
ray energy remains at about Ecr < 0.07 ESN during the entire evolution. 
The ongoing particle acceleration smoothens the shock front and the in- 
creasing precursor spreads the two curves F,,s and F~,p. The last calculated 
model at 5.26 10~years exhibits a shock radius of 14.4 pc indicating again 
that the motion of the forward shock is not affected by radiative cooling if 
the acceleration of particles in shock waves is taken into account. 
The 7-ray fluxes from r°-decay yield 10 -1° phcm-2s -1 for a typical 
remnant with no = 0.3 cm -3 with a small amount of cosmic ray energy at 
a time of 300 years and increase almost like R~ 3 due to geometric effects. 
Remnants with higher h ~ctions of cosmic rays or remnants evolving into 
a medium of higher ambient density produce 7-ray fluxes of up to about 
10 -6 ph cm-2s -1 (normalized to a SNR at a distance of 1 kpc). In the latter 
case the 7-ray fluxes are almost constant between 104 and 106 years. 
Summarizing the 7-ray results we have seen that radiative cooling and 
Alfv~nic heating are essential to determine the 7-ray luminosities origi- 
nating from neutral pion decay in evolving SNR's. I emphasize the den- 
sity enhancements due to cooling and the occurrence of complicated struc- 
tures in the downstream region of the shock wave which produce fluctua- 
tions in the collisional production of neutral pions and the associated 7-ray 
fluxes (Figs. 23,24). Since most SN are exploding into an inhomogeneous 
medium cloud evaporation and crusching as well as non-radial motions can 
produce similar fluctuations of the 7-ray flux. In a cloudy medium such 
7-ray variations will occur even in the case of a constant cosmic ray en- 
ergy density (cf. McKee 1988 for a recent review on SNR evolution into an 
inhomogeneous medium). Ambient densities of a no -~ 5 cm -3 can lead to 
7-ray fluxes of up to 10-6ph cm-2s -1 (normalized to a source distance of 
d = 1 kpc) even in the cases where the total cosmic ray energy Ecr remains 
at a few percent of the initial SN-explosion energy ESN. 
Conclusions 
Since this is the written version of the lectures given in Graz I have to 
admit that it is almost impossible to give a comprehensive review about the 
interstellar medium and supernova remnants. However, I hope that some of 
the unsolved problems concerning a theory of the interstellar medium have 
become clear during this course and I am looking forward to the solutions 
which might emerge from this audience of young scientists in the next years.

HIGH ENERGY EMISSION FROM 
NORMAL STARS 
Loul~as Vlahos 
Department of Physics, University of Thessaloniki, 
54006 Thessaloniki, Greece 
Abstract: Emission from high-energy electrons and ions in normal stars is a complex 
phenomenon since it is related to: (1) the e,mrgy release and particle acceleration 
processes, (2) tile structure of tile ambient magnetic field, and (3) tile structure of 
the ambient atmosphere of these stars. Energy release, heating and acceleration are 
processes that are not well understood yet, so theoretical estimates of the high-energy 
emission is bound to use "avlificial" velocity distribution functions for the energetic 
particles. We review tile flow of energy in normal stars, tile fundamental emission and 
absorption processes for spontaneous and collective emission and apply our results on 
selective observations. Our goal is to derive from the observations and the physics of 
radiation processes tile properties of high-energy particles.

1 Introduction 
Standard text books in astrophysics (e.g., Shu, 1982; Bowers and Deeming, 1984) 
discuss at length the low-energy or atomic emission from normal stars. An exten- 
sive literature exists on these topics (see Athay, 1972; Sobolev, 1963; Griem, 1964; 
Sobelman,1979 and references therein). In these lectures we analyse the emission 
of the high-energy electrons (E > 100keV). Ions are accelerated efficiently but 
they do not radiate as efficiently as the electrons since mi = 1873m,,where ml 
is the mass of the ion and rn~ is mass of the electron. When ions reach very 
high energies they excite collisionally nuclear lines. This very interesting topic 
is beyond the scope of these lectures (see Ramaty and Murphy, 1987). 
An important factor that influences the characteristics of the high-energy 
emission (intensity, spectra, time evolution, polarisation, etc.), is the detailed 
shape of the distribution of the accelerated electrons (e.g. energy dependence, 
angular shape of the velocity distribution, etc). This information is related to 
the dynamics of the energy release process, the acceleration process and the 
transport of energetic particles from the acceleration volume to the radiation 
volume (these two volumes are not always co-spatial). 
Energy release and acceleration of particles are processes that are closely 
related to the flow of energy in normal stars. We should follow first the flow of 
energy inside a normal star and show qualitatively that electrons can reach very 
high energies at the surface of the star. 
1.1 Energy flow and particle acceleration 
Assuming that a normal star is composed of a hydrogen burning core, a radi- 
ation zone and a convection zone we can reach several important conclusions: 
(1) the turbulent convection zone generates magnetic flux tubes (turbulent dy- 
namo, see Stix, 1989), (2) Buoymacy elevates the flux tubes to the surface of the 
star (Parker, 1979), and (3) since one portion of the emerged magnetic field is 
still inside the convection zone, where the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic 
pressure is much larger than one (fl = ,0knT where no is the ambient density, 
B= /s~ , 
B the magnetic field intensity, T tile plasma temperature and kD Boltzmann's 
constant), and the other is inside the tenuous atmosphere of the star where the 
opposite is true, the fluid motion inside the convection zone controls the mo- 
tion and disturbs the magnetic field. Disturbances and interactions of flux tubes 
will transfer and dissipate magnetic energy in the stellar atmosphere. A fraction 
of the dissipated energy will be transferred to the high-energy particles. The 
B 2 
available magnetic energy inside a volume V is WF = (~-~) × V. Assuming that 
B ~ 100G and V = (101°cm) s the available energy is 10Z2erga. Let us Mso 
assume that the plasma density in the low atmosphere of the star is 101°cm -3 
and only 0.1% of the mnbient plasma is accelerated, then the average energy per 
electron will exceed .~ 100keV if the acceleration efficiency is 0.1%. 
The topology of the emerged magnetic ficld above a turbulent convection 
zone is a poorly understood subject. Complex magnetic topologies evolve by 

131 
dissipating energy or diffusion of magnetic flux in space. It is important to un- 
derstand (a) how magnetic fields dissipate energy and (b) how a part of this 
energy will be deposited to charged particles. Reviewing the state of the art on 
these problems will lead us away from our main subject but it is important to 
mention the trends in the current research on these topics. 
We mentioned already that turbulent flows inside the convection zone disturb 
the magnetic field that has already emerged from the surface of the star. MHD 
waves excited from these disturbances will propagate along the magnetic field 
and dissipate part of their energy inside the atmosphere. Magnetic fields filter 
the spectrum of waves that exist in the photosphere and allow the propagation of 
selected frequencies that can resonate with the structures that exist. Propagation 
of these waves and dissipation in the chromosphere or corona is one way energy 
is constantly transnfitted from the convection zone to the stellar atmosphere 
(Heyvaerts, 1989).

Fig. 1. Active region magnetic field and dynamic formation of neutral sheets 
Magnetic fields are also split and filamented by the randomly moving coherent 
structures below the photosphere, new flux is constantly emerging and/or sub- 
merging (see review by Martin, 1990). Such small-scale structures are observed 
regularly in the Sun and probably are common in most normal stars. Emerged 
magnetic structures interact aaad form 'singular points' which are called neu- 
tral sheets. Formation of neutral sheets and sudden release of energy is also a 

132 
poorly understood topic. In Fig.l, we demonstrate graphically the interaction of 
pre-existing magnctic field lines with newly emerged structures and show the for- 
mation of many independent neutral sheets. It is well known that a neutral sheet 
will heat locally the plasma, accelerate a small portion of electrons and form two 
opposite moving slow shocks (Priest, 1990). The presence of many neutral sheets 
simultaneously above the active region will form an environment where many 
local acceleration events act simultaneously on the particles (see Anastasiadis 
and Vlahos, 1991; Vla.hos, 1989). We conclude that in normal stars, acceleration 
of high-energy particles is part of the evolution of the active region through the 
formation of thousands of reconnection sites. 
The terms "heating" and "acceleration" need some discussion especially when 
applied to astrophysical objects and related to observations with poor spatial 
and temporal resolution. It is widely accepted that "heating" is called the process 
that will raise the mean energy of the plasma, i.e., increase the temperature of 
the MaxweUian distribution 
n o 
v 2 
s(,) = 
(1.1) 
where Vj = (ksTj/mj) '/2 is the thermal velocity, j = e,/ (for electrons and 
ions). Acceleration is usually cMled a process that will "energise" the electrons 
and ions with velocity v >> Vj and form a non-Maxwellian tail e.g., a power 
law distribution. A serious complication arises when: (1) the heating is localised 
and the high-energy tail propagating away from the heated volume will appear 
in other parts of the stellar atmosphere as a "beam" of high-energy particles 
(Raoult et al. 1990), and (2) acceleration processes sometimes form super-hot 
Maxwellian distributions (see Vas'kov et al., 1983). It is then apparent that when 
the observed spectrum fits with the results obtained from a Maxwellian distri- 
bution this does not mean automatically that we are dealing with a heating 
process and vice versa. The terms "heating" and "acceleration" have been con- 
fused many times in discussions of astrophysical plasmas mainly from the lack 
of detail modelling and multi-wave length observations(e.g., soft X-ray, Hard 
X-ray, radio and v-ray data). 
In summary, energy generated in the core flows along the radiation zone, sets 
up turbulence in the convection zone, and generates magnetic fields in the form 
of flux tubes, buoyancy forces the magnetic field outside the convection zone and 
finally this partially submerged, partiMly emerged, field serves as a transmission 
line for the transfer of energy from turbulent flow to the magnetic field to the 
plasma. Transmitted energy will be dissipated in steady-state form to provide 
the "coronal heating", and/or in impulsive form releasing the energy observed 
during "flares". The lack of a convection zone will eliminate most of the high 
energy emission from normal stars. 

133 
1.2 Basic concepts 
Radiation, once it is generated, will propagate inside the stellar atmosphere and 
the interstellar medium before reaching the Earth or a satellite inside the solar 
system. Transfer of electromagnetic radiation inside a plasma is a very complex 
phenomenon and requires detailed knowledge of the propagation medium. Ra- 
diation may be re-absorbed by the atmosphere of the star and never reach the 
observer or the medium may absorb selectively certain frequencies (absorption 
lines). 
Emission is defined by the monochromatic emission coefficient j~, which is 
measured in energy dE 
(er9) per unit time dt (s -1) per volume dV 
(cm -3) 
per solid angle d~l (stev -1) and unit frequency du 
(Hz-l), according to 
dE = jJudtdfldV 
(1.2) 
The absorption coefficient is defined as av(cm -a). The radiation transfer equa- 
tion is (Bowers and Deeming, 1984)

Several important problems related to various approximations on the transport 
of radiation, such as scattering, radiation diffusion, etc., can be found in standard 
textbooks on radiation (see e.g. Rybicki and Lightman, 1979). 
Electrons accelerated or decelerated in vacuum will emit radiation. In the non 
relativistic limit the total energy radiated a.wa~" is (in the dipole approximation)

Eq. (1.9) is used extensively for the estimate of the spontaneous emission of 
non-relativistic particles. Another important parameter used extensively in as- 
trophysics is the brightuess ~emperature Tb, for which the intensity (Iu) from a 
given source is equal to the black body emission, 
Zv = Bo(w, Tb). 
(1.11) 
In radio astronomy where the Rayleigh-Jeans law is appliccable (hv << kBT), 
Tb is

(1.12) 
where intensity (I~,) is measured in milliJansky, the apparent radius of the star 
in miUiarc seconds (mas), normalised with the apparent radius of the Sun at 10 
pc (0.48 mas). 
We can define two general classes of radiation: (1) spontaneous or incoherent 
emission, e.g., synchrotron aald bremsstrahlung emission, a~d (2) collective or 
coherent radiation, e.g., plasma emission or electron cyclotron maser emission. 
One important characteristic that distinguishes spontaneous or incoherent emis- 
sion from collective emission is the brightness temperature. When the brightness 
temperature is Tb >> 101°K the emitting source has probably achieved an or- 
der of coherence. Other observational factors which suggest coherence are high 
polarisation (100%) and narrow bandwidth ( -~ << 1). 
We will discuss first the spontaneous emission, which is most common in 
normal stars and then continue with the collective emission. 
2 Spontaneous 
emission 
2.1 Bremsstrahlung emission 
Radiation due to the acceleration of a charge in the Coulomb field of another 
charge is called free-free emission or bremsstrahlung. It is obvious that if the 
scattering center is a like particle (electron-electron, proton-proton) the dipole 
moment (Y] qiri) is proportional to the center of mass (Y] miri) which is a 
constant of the motion (e.g. ~i 
~ 
'? 
m~rrtiri(t) = ~ d2 
qi ,it = ~ 
Ei 
,,,, ~ 
Ei miri(t) = 

135 
0, since~i miri = R ~ mi, where R is the radius vector of the center of mass) 
and the free-free emission in the dipole approximation is zero (see eq. (1.9)). 
In Fig. 2 we show an electron with charge e moving rapidly in the field of an 
ion. The distance between the line of flight of the electron and the ion is called 
impact parameter (b).

The smM1 angle scattering is the most frequent and we are going to use this

The total spectrum of radiation from a medium with ion density Ni and 
electron density N~ and for fixed velocity v for all electrons is estimated as

logarithm its exact value is not important. We will use bm..= -~ here. The bmi.

The Gaunt factor depends on the velocity of the electron and the frequency 
of the emitted photon. An accurate estimate of the free-free emission needs a 
quantum treatment but a classical approximation gives the correct functional 
dependence for most of the physical parameters, quantum corrections will im- 
prove the accuracy of the Gaunt factor. Extensive tables mad graphs exist in the 
literature (Karzas and Latter, 1961).

sion from a thermal distribution, when the distribution function is Maxwellian or 
from a non-thermal distribution using a power law or other types of non-thermal 
distributions. For a Maxwellian distribution (and since dw = 27rdu) we obtain

dVdt = 1.4. lO-27T1/2Z2NeNig(1 + 4.4.10-1°T). 
(2.11) 
For other types of non-thermal distributions we can use eq. (2.6) to estimate 
the emission coefficient. It is important to notice that if a small number of non- 
thermal electrons radiate, the emission coefficient will probably be controlled 
by them. The absorption coefficient on the other hand should be estimated 
from the ambient Maxwellian plasma. In speciM cases, when the non-thermal 
particles reach relatively large numbers (nb/no ,-~ 1, where nb is the density of 
the energetic particles) the self absorption from the energetic particles should 
be considered. 

138 
2.2 Cyclotron and Synchrotron emission 
The presence of magnetic field inside the plasma will force the ions and elec- 
trons to gyrate around the magnetic field lines. The emission is primarily due to 
electrons gyrating around the magnetic field. The equation of motion is 
dp 
(e) (wB) 
(2.12) 
d--7= 7 
where p = 7mev, m, is the electron rest mass. Depending on the energy of 
the electron, the spectrum changes dramatically. The emitted radiation is called 
cyclotron emission if the velocity of the particle is non-relativistic or synchrotron 
emission if the velocity is close to the speed of light. 
We assume that the energy lost per cycle is so small that the energy of 
the particle remains almost constant (note that the velocity is perpendicular to 
the force (elc)(v~B) acting on the electron). Solving eq. (2.12) we obtain the 
velocity of the particle and its position 
v = exv.L cos(to0t) + e~v± sin(wot) + ezVll

Harmonies with m=0,-1,-2,-3 ... were elimi-

even for extreme values of e and B the loss is totally insignificant; (2) We can

electron (e << m0c 2) to radiate away its energy

that is, synchrotron losses can be important for the duration of transient events 
and continuous acceleration may be needed when long lasting events are ob- 
served. When the energy of the electron is such that mfl << 1 (for re=l,2,...), 
the Bessel function can be replaced by the asymptotic series expansion for small 
arguments. Thus

The spectrum consist of a serics of discrete lines of rapidly decreasing intensity. 
The lines are separated by wb (SCe Fig. (6.2) in Bekefi, 1965). 
A number of effects will influence the width of the cyclotron lines. The most 
important factors are: (1) the cnergy loss by radiation will impose a frequency 
width l/r, where r is given in eq. (2.19); (2) collisions will force the line width 
to be of the order of the collision frequency; (3) the random motion of particles 
along the line of force; (4) the relativistic change of the mass will influence the 
cyclotron frequency, and (5) non-uniformity of thc ambient magnetic field inside 
the radiation source. 
The radiation emitted from highly relativistic electrons is beamed along the 
forward direction into a narrow cone of angle 2 cos-l(/~), as seen by the observer 
in the distant field of the electron.

The polarisation of the emitted radiation can be estimated from the radiation 
propagated at right angles with respect to the magnetic field (8 = ~'/2). The 
emissivity given in eq. (2,15) is made up of two factors: one with E 11 B which

Energetic particles in normal stars have energies between 20keV - 500keV. 
This energy range is usually called mildly relativistic and the approximations 
made above are not valid. When the energy is not too high, the total power

The absorption coefficient (which is called self-absorption here) is derived 
from eq. (2.36) and the emission from a uniform slab of plasma with thickness 
L is 
I (°'') = Bo(w,T)[1 - e-'~oL]. 
(2.38) 
It is obvious that when a~,L >> 1 the synchrotron emission will be self-absorbed 
and the observer will see a black body spectrum up to a characteristic harmonic 
in*. The plasma will be optically thin only if (x~'~)L = A~4 i < 1, where 
A = w2L/(wbC). For L = lOScm, n --- 10ecru -a, T = 50keV and B = 1000G we 
(o,~)T 
find A ,,~ 105, which means that when ~ 4~ < 10 -5 the a~ 
z, will be smaller 
than unity. Using Fig. 5 we conclude that m > m* = 14 for optically thin 
emission. In summary, only high harmonics will escape from a normal star when 
the source is heated to very high temperatures (e.g., during flares). 
A detail study of the emission spectrum for other types of distributions (e.g. 
loss cone and runaway distributions) have been presented in the literature (see 
Winskie and Boyd, 1983; Winskie et al., 1983). The spectra are very sensitive 
to the angular shape of the distribution and these results are useful only when 
detailed modelling of the velocity distribution is available, In normal stars only 
two types of distributions are used: a Maxwellian when we model a hot plasma or 
a power law when we model a population of high energy particles. The number 
of free-parameters is high in most stellar sources so it is difficult to distinguish 
the shape of the distribution using only radio observations (radio emission in 
normal stars is partially due to synchrotron emission). A combination of X-ray

chrotron spectra for thermal and power law (f ~x E -6) distributions (see Fig.

3 Collective plasma emission 
3.1 Plasma radiation 
Plasmas in nature are not always stable. The presence of energetic electrons or 
ions is a source of free energy which can drive several plasma instabilities. We 
discuss here the simplest unstable system that can occur in normal stars when 
energetic particles are accelerated locally: the beam-plasma interaction. In Fig.7 
we present a scenario for the formation of a beam-plasma distribution function.

Fig. 7. Formation of a beam-plasma distribution in space plasmas 
In the volume I the plasma is heated explosively aald electrons with velocity 
v >> Vj, where Vj is the thermal velocity, are accelerated to high energies. The 
energetic particles stream away from the acceleration volume and in volume II 
form a beam-plasma distribution f = f,, + fb, where fm is the local Maxwellian 
distribution,

Vb is the beam velocity, Veb is the thermal spread of the beam and nb is the 
density of the berun particles. This type of systems are rather common in stellar 
atmospheres above evolving active regions. In the Sun, the beam-plasma inter- 
action is thought to be responsible for a very common radio burst, called type 
III burst. 
We prescnt a qualitative description of the evolution of such a system in 
a non- magnetised plasma (see Nicholson, 1983). Three types of waves can be 

145 
excited in a non-magnetised plasma. (a) The high-frequency electrostatic waves, 
called plasma or Langmuir waves. Their dispersion relation is

It is important to mention that the electrostatic waves cannot propagate 
outside the plasma (e.g., when w~ ---* 0, Te ---* 0). Only for the high-frequency 
electromagnetic wave the dispersion relation inside the plasma joins smoothly 
with the vacuum dispersion relation (w~,n = kc). The plasma waves can escape 
from the plasma only when they are coupled non-linearly with the electromag- 
netic wave through a wave-wave interaction. The plasma emission is an indirect 

146 
process. When the electromagnetic wave is excited from an unstable distribu- 
tion, then the radiation will escape immediately and it is called direct emission. 
In the next section we will briefly discuss a direct process: the electron cyclotron 
maser instability. 
The presence of a beam of mildly relativistic electrons will excite plasma 
waves with a linear growth rate (Nicholson, 1983) 
The electric field associated with this instability is

, 
¢a/l( 
plasma system 
The non-linear evolution of the beam plasma system is not trivial. There are 
two separate ways to approach the problem. (1) In the framework of the weak 
turbulence theory (Sagdeev rind GMeev, 1969) we can use standard perturbation 
techniques when the anlplitude of the excited waves is small compared to the 
thermal energy of the ambient plasma. (2) The amplitude of the wave is so high 
that they modify of the linear dispersion relation and the perturbation analysis 
is not valid. The analysis followed in this case is not standard and is called strong 
turbulence theory. A full description of the weak turbulence theory or the strong 
turbulence theory is outside the scope of these lectures. We will outline briefly 
the main conclusions from the application of each theory to the beam plasma 
system. 
The wave particle interaction in the framework of the weak turbulence theory 
is handle by a system of equations known as Quasilinear equations (Nicholson, 
1983). The evolution of the velocity distribution is shown in Fig. 9. The instabil- 
ity saturates due to the change of the velocity distribution of the beam particles 

147 
(fb). The beam velocity distribution will become flat when t ~ c~ and the linear 
growth rate (eq (3.5)) approaches zero. 
The beam plasma system follows a different evolution when the wave energy 
exceed a threshold (see Goldman, 1984). The growing electrostatic waves change 
the linear dispersion relation of the plasma waves (forming solitons in the electric 
field and eavitons in the density of the ambient plasma). The wave number of 
the beam excited wave will be forced to become larger (in order to be a mode 
on the new dispersion relation) and the phase velocity of the beam driven waves 
will approach the thermal speed. The system is now non-linearly stable since the 
interaction of waves with the beam particles is not possible. 
The results from the two approaches are remarkably different. The weak tur- 
bulence theory (valid mostly for very weak and not so energetic beams) suggests 
that the beam quickly change its shape (becoming flat in the velocity space) and 
the growth of the waves vanish. The beam, according to this scenario, will not 
propagate very far. Thc strong turbulence theory, on the other hand, suggests 
that the beam quickly enters a non-linearly stable state which allow the beam to 
propagate long distances (Papadopoulos et al., 1974). A useful conclusion from 
this analysis is that strong (nb/no > 10 -4) and energetic beams (several keV) 
will easily cross the corona and propagate iu the interplmmtary space since they 
are non-linearly stable. 
Several scenarios for the evolution of beam plasma systems that are not so 
strict show that the picture is never so clear. In most stellar applications the 
beam energetics are such that a mixed evolution is most probable (see Hillaris, 
1988). 
The next question that is relevant to our lectures is the radiation emitted 
from a beam of particles. The weak turbulence theory suggest that the excited 
waves will resonate with the other two normal modes of the non-magnetised 
ambient plasma (ion acoustic and electromagnetic waves) and transfer energy to 
the electromagnetic wave. The three wave interaction 
WL + o's --* w .... 
(3.7) 
and 
kL -[" ks ""* ~'em 
(3.8) 
(multiplying Eqs (3.7) and (3.8) with h we recover the well known relation 
for the conservation of energy and momentum in Quantum mechanics) is a well 
known problem that is analysed in many plasma physics textbooks (e.g., Sagdeev 
and Galeev, 1969). Other interactions are also possible, e.g., the interaction of 
two plasma waves with an electromagnetic wave with frequency Were = 2we, 
the decay of a plasma wave to another plasma wave and an ion acoustic wave 
or to an electromagnetic wave and an ion acoustic wave (Melrose, 1986). We 
then conclude that the presence of a beam excited spectrum of plasma waves 
can drive non-linearly several normal modes of the ambient plasma including 
electromagnetic waves which can escape from the plasma and propagate inside 
the free space (vacuum) with frequencies weT, = we or 2w~. 

148 
We can reach similar results using a fully non-linear 2} numerical code when 
the system is driven in the strong turbulence regime. Akimoto et al. (1988) found 
that solitons emit electromagnetic radiation with frequencies w¢,2w, and even 
3we (see Fig.10)

3.2 Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability 
The presence of magnetic field in the stellar atmosphere is responsible for many 
radicM changes on the flow of plasmas, e.g., closed field lines are associated with 
active regions. A collection of loops with low magnetic field in the coronM part 
and strong field in the foot will trap energetic electrons and form a special type 
of velocity distribution known as loss-cone distribution. 
Charged particle gyrating inside the magnetic field conserve their magnetic 
moment 
1/2mvl 
(3.9) 
P= 
B 
where V_L is the velocity component vertical to the magnetic field. If the particle 
starts at the apex of the loop with v± >> vii and propagates towards the strong 
magnetic field, it will reach a point where v± = v and vii = 0. The particle 
will be reflected at this point and return back to the coronal part of the loop. 
Assuming now that ma isotropic distribution is injected towards the foot of the 
arcade and that the particles reflected inside the chromosheric part of the loop 
will lose all their energy to collisions, trapped particles will form a distribution 
where a cone is missing (see Fig. 11)

collisionally lose all their energy. Electrons with pitcll angles larger than O~r 
will be reflected back in the coronal part of the loop. O¢~ is the loss cone angle 
if B2 = Bfoot, where Bfoot is the value of the magnetic field at the transition 
region.

where H is a step function which takes into account the loss cone anisotropy, a is 
the mirror ratio. Mildly relativistic electrons forming loss-cone type distributions 
are unstable to electromagnetic cyclotron waves with frequency w = nwo (Wu, 
eB 
1985). Electrons resonate with the cyclotron wave w0 = ~'~c(1 - v/c) -1/2 = 
Wb(1 -- v2/(2c2)) when they satisfy the condition 
wr - w0 - kllVll = 0. 
(3.14) 
If the velocity distribution has a positive slope in this velocity regime electro- 
magnetic cyclotron waves will be excited. The most favourable mode is the first 
harmonic extraordinary wave, when the frequency is above the X-mode cut-off 
frequency (Nicholson, 1983)

where J' = dJ/db, b = kj_v±/wb, k±/kll >> 1. Assuming that the particles are 
mildly relativistic (v/c << 1) we can make several assumptions. (1) We can 
expand the relativistic correction factor 7 = (1 - v2/c~) -~/2 ,~ (1 - v2/2c2), 
(2) b is small and we can replace the Bessel functions J~(b) with v~/4c 2 and 
(J~(b)) 2 with 1/4, (3) the term Of/Ovll is neglected when Of~Or± ~ Of/Ovll 
since kll ~ 0, and finally (4) we ignore the presence of the ambient plasma. Then

It is obvious that the growth rate for the X-mode is higher and the radiation 
emitted in a narrow cone around 90 °. 
Including the ambient plasma in the velocity distribution and using the com- 
plete dispersion we can estimate the growth rate of the first harmonics (see Fig. 

151 
12). It is obvious that as the plasma density increases the linear growth rate 
of the first and higher harmonics of the extraordinary and the ordinary mode 
changes dramatically.

Fig. 12. The maximum growth rate as a function of wJwo. The first and second 
harmonic for the X-mode (solid line) and O-mode (dashed line) are shown 
In fact, for we/wb < 0.3, the fundamental X-mode has the highest growth 
rate, for 0.3 < we/wo < 1 the fundamental O-mode and the second harmonic X- 
mode dominate (Sharma aa~d Vlahos, 1984). As the ratio w,/wb increases above 
unity, no direct emission is expected (the electrostatic modes have the largest 
growth rate). It is easy to show that the mode with the largest growth rate 
will be the dominant mode and will saturate the instability before the other 
modes grow to any appreciable level (Sharma et al., 1982). The effects of finite 
plasma temperature and superthermal tails on the ambient distribution on the 
evolution of the Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) have been studied by many 
authors (Sharma and Vlahos, 1984; Winglee, 1985; Vlahos and Sharma, 1985). 
These results are important for the application of the ECM in solar or stellar 
flares since the loss-cone particles and the super hot and dense plasma almost 
co-exist. 
The linear theory discussed so far suggest only the frequency range and the 
wave numbers that will be excited by the loss cone distribution. The exponential 
growth lasts only 50-100 growth times, tg ,,~ 7~ "1 (where 7i is the growth rate 
of the mode j). The saturation time for typical solar or stellar parameters is 
,~ lO-Ssec. The evolution of the burst follows very closely the characteristics of 
the injection function of the energetic particles. 
The amplification of the Electron Cyclotron Maser is due to the positive 
slope in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. One possible way 
to saturate the instability is for the growing waves to flatten the distribution 

152 
in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field (using the standard quasi- 
linear theory mentioned above). Numerical simulations by Wagner et al. (1984), 
Pritchet (1984), Lin et al. (1984) demonstrated that only 1 - 5% (Fig.13) of the 
energy carried by the energetic particles will be radiated away. This efficiency 
is enough for producing extremely high brightness temperature (Tb ,~ 1018 -- 
101TK).

4 Observations 
Magnetic-field dynamics in the convection zone and solar atmosphere is crucial 
for the high-energy emission since: (1) the energy release processes and particle 
energisation will form and sustain the injection distribution, (2) the magnetic- 
field topology will guide the energetic particles away from the energy release 
(energetic particle transport) and re-shape the initial distribution. Injected dis- 
tributions evolve differently in open or closed magnetic field lines. In the stellar 
atmospheres two types of magnetic topologies exist: (1) closed field lines associ- 
ated mainly with the active regions, (2) open field lines associated mainly with 
coronal holes. In Fig. 14 we present a cascade of scales that naturally appear 
during the evolution of magnetic fields. 
We will focus our attention on active regions where most of the high-energy 
electrons are accelerated. A variety of observations have been recorded and it is 
impossible to review all of them here; instead, we plan to present only a small 
subset of the available data that are related to the processes presented above.

4.1 Hard X-ray emission 
In Fig. 15a we present a series of solar bursts in the energy range 40keV < E < 
25MeV. The spectrum at the peak of the intensity is given in Fig. 15b. The 
existing data can be interpreted as follows: 
A power law velocity distribution is formed impulsively inside a loop or in 
the boundaries of a collection of loops. This distribution is called the injection 
distribution. Energetic electrons trapped and precipitated in the low atmosphere 
will collide with the ambient plasma and emit X-rays. This model can explain 
the spectra and the time evolution of the emitted X-ray radiation (Vilmer, 1987). 
Bremsstrahlung emission is the main radiation process that can interpret success- 
fully the X-ray data. Many questions remain open on the critical energy where 
the distribution changes from thermal to power law, and the energy where the 
slope of the distribution changes (usually at very high energies). We can now ask 
if this type of injection distribution can explain the radio data. We will discuss 
this topic in the next section.

4.2 Radio Observations 
Trapped energetic electrons gyrate in the strong magnetic field of the low lying 
arcades and emit synchrotron radiation that is responsible for the microwave 
bursts. Microwave and X-ray emission are almost co-spatial and have the same 
time evolution (Kundu and Vlahos, 1982). Unfortunately only a few attempts 
have been made for simultaneous modelling of both signatures. 
In section 3.2 we proved that trapped energetic electrons form loss cone 
velocity distributions that are unstable to the ECM instability when w0 >> we. 
A very intense (brightness temperature ~ 10aSK), highly polarised and spiky 
radio burst was observed (Slottje, 1978) which is believed to be the signature of 
this instability. In Fig. 16 we show an example of a microwave burst recorded with 
a high time resolution, and we can make three important points: (1) The spiky 
component is added on top of the normal microwave burst, (2) the duration 
of each spike is a few milliseconds and its polarisation is very high (almost 
100%) of the spike, (3) the spiky emission stops at the peak of the normal burst, 
probably due to the changes of the mnbient plasma. All these characteristics can 
be explained by the ECM theory (Vlahos, 1987; Melrose, 1991). 
Electrons accelerated in the boundary of arcades or drifted outside the closed 
field lines will stream along the open field lines forming field aligned beams 
of energetic electrons. These beams excite a number of bursts that have been 
observed, e.g., type III bursts. In section 3.1 we analysed the emission from

a beam-plasma system. We proved that the beam driven plasma waves will 
resonate with the electromagnetic waves and emit radiation with frequencies 
we and 2w e. The plasma frequency is a function of the ambient density (we oc 
V"~) and since the density decreases as we move away from the surface of the 
Sun, we should expect the emission to drift to smaller frequencies. The slope of 
the emission in the frequency vs time diagram is an indication of the velocity 
of the beam if the no(z) is known. Using such arguments, we estimated the 
Vb = 101ecm/see. In Fig. 17 we present the dynamic spectrum of type III burst. 
Energetic particles trapped in large arcades will form loss cone (in weak magnetic 
fields) and beam driven instabilities. In the high frequency part of the spectrum 
we observe again the spiky component in the dcm part of the spectrum. This 
component is rather common in most flares and a close association of dcm spikes 
and a group of type III bursts has been reported (Aschwanden and Gudel, 1992). 
Radio emission from other stars (see review by Dulk, 1985) follows very 
closely the characteristics of the emission observed from the Sun. In Fig. 18 
we present an example of highly polarised very intense radio burst recorded at 
Arecibo from the dMe star AD Leo, which is interpreted as the signature of the 
ECM instability.

In summary, using simple models for the magnetic-field structure and the 
injection distribution we have succeed to interpret successfully the observed radio 
and X-ray data. A major setback to our analysis is the lack of simultaneous 
multi-wavelength data. It is true that many open questions still exist but they 
are mostly related to the dynamic evolution of the burst, the polarisation etc., 
that require more careful modelling. Models for the evolution and propagation 

157 
of radiation are difficult to construct since they require much more detailed 
knowledge of the environment. 
5 Summary and Conclusions 
We have made an attempt in these lectures to present a global view of the high- 
energy emission from normal stars. We focussed only on the emission associated 
with high-energy electrons and avoided completely the emission of the high- 
energy ions, e.g., nuclear lines etc. We showed that the energy flow inside a 
normal star follow several stages. 
Energy released inside the stellar core ----* propagation inside the radiation 
zone ----* drive turbulence in the convection zone and generate magnetic fields 
(dynamo) ----* escape of the magnetic field from the active region (buoyancy) and 
formation of active regions --~ random photospheric motions and/or emergence 
of new flux generate neutral sheets and local explosions ~ 
acceleration of 
particles, heating and local flows ~ 
interaction of energetic particles with the 
ambient plasma and the magnetic field generate high energy emission through 
processes such as (1) bremsstrahlung, (2) synchrotron radiation, (3) collective 
plasma emission, and (4) nuclear interactions (not discussed here). Analysing 
the observations (ground based or from satellites) we can infer the shape of the 
injection distribution and the topology of the magnetic field. 
The picture that has emerged over the years is as follows: 
1. Energetic electrons (Energy > lOOkeV) are either trapped and precipitate 
in the low atmosphere, or stream in open field lines to generate: 
Hard X-ray emission 
microwave bursts 
Microwave spikes 
type III bursts 
trapped or precipitate 
trapped electrons 
trapped (loss cone) 
streaming 
bremsstrahlung 
Synchrotron 
ECM 
beam instabilities 
2. The injected distribution of energetic electrons above lOOkeV has the 
following characteristics: 
(a) power law in energy f ~x E -6, where 5 = 3 - 10; (b) acceleration time 10 
milliseconds to minutes, (c) total nmnber of accelerated electrons is 103~ - 1038 
These characteristics are mostly derived from Solar data that are more de- 
tailed, but observations from other stars follow similar patterns: the scenario 
presented in these lectures is rather universal and covers the evolution of most 
normal stars.

Accretion in Close Binaries

1. Introduction 
Virtually all binaries with periods of less then a few years will interact at some 
stage of their evolution, because the radius of one of the stars will become com- 
parable with the binary separation. The interaction usually involves the transfer 
of mass from one star to another. As we shall shortly see, accretion of this mat- 
ter by the other star can be an extremely energetic process if the latter star 
is compact, i.e. a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole. Accordingly, the in- 
vestigation of close binaries is a particularly fascinating field, characterized by 
the interplay of stellar evolution theory and the study of accretion processes. A 
general reference for much of the materiM presented here is the book by Frank 
e~ al. (1992). 
1.1. Energy Yields 
Nuclear Burning 
The most efficient way of extracting energy from matter in thermonuclear pro- 
cesses is via the conversion of hydrogen to helium: other processes yield consid- 
erably less. The maximum energy which can be liberated from a mass AM by 
thermonuclear processes is 
AE.u~ = 0.007AMc 2 
=6 
X 10 TM erg g-1 
(1) 

162 
Accretion on to a Compact Object 
For all object of mass M with a hard surface of radius R. the energy yield is 
GM AM 
AEa¢¢ = -~. 
(2) 
so that the efficiency evidently rises the more compact the accreting star is, i.e. 
the larger the ratio M/R.. For a white dwarf (M ,~ M®, R, ,,~ 10 9 cm) we find 
AEacc ~ 1017 erg g-1 
(3), 
while for a neutron star (M ,-- M®, R. ,,~ 10 6 cm) we have 
AEacc "~ 1020 erg g-1 
(4). 
A black hole might have a somewhat higher mass (few Mo) , but does not 
have a hard surface, so that we expect an estimate like (4) again. 
We conclude that accretion on to neutron stars and black holes is the most 
energetically efficient process, being some 20x the maximum nuclear burning 
efficiency. In principle nuclear burning of matter on the surface of a white dwarf 
should yield more energy than released as it accretes. However the nuclear pro- 
cesses are frequently explosive (novae), so that here too accretion is the dominant 
energy source most of the time. The instantaneous luminosity from accretion on 
to a star with a hard surface is 
G M_~I 
L~¢¢ - -
-
 
(5). 
R. 
1.2. Radiation Spectrum 
We expect the radiation emerging from accretion processes to be characterized 
by two temperatures: 
( Lacc "~ 1/4 
Teff= \4~R~.o ] 
(6) 
and 
Tv-- GMme 
(7), 
kR. 
rather like the effective and central temperatures of a star. Teff corresponds 
to cases where the accretion energy is thermalized before being radiated, and 
Tv to cases where the infall energy (mainly in protons of mass mp) is given up 
directly, e.g. in shocks. We thus get an idea of the likely emission from accretion 
processes by computing kTe~ and kTv. 
For neutron stars and black holes, with 1036 erg s -1 < L~cc < 1038 erg s -1 
we find T~fr ,'~ 107 K, kTefr "~ 1 keV, Tv '~ 1012 K, kTv ,'~ 100 MeV, so that we 
can expect X-rays and possibly gamma rays. 

163 
For accretion on to white dwarfs, Lace "~ 105 erg s -1 gives Ten" "" 105 K, 
kTen" "~ 10 eV, Tv "~ 109 K, kTy ~ 100 keV, implying UV, soft X-ray and 
possibly hard X-ray emission. 
We can thus make the identifications 
accreting neutron stars, black holes =_ X- ray binaries (XRBs) 
accreting white dwarfs =_ cataclysmic variables (CVs) 
Thernmnuclear Events 
For accreting compact stars we can easily identify the thermonuclear events as 
neutron stars, black holes: (most) X-ray bursts 
white dwarfs: novae. 
Since AEac¢ < AE, uc for white dwarfs but not neutron stars, we expect mass 
ejection to occur in novae, but not in X-ray bursts. 
1.3. Rotational Energy 
A star can store energy in the form of rotation, particularly if it has been spun 
up by accreting angular momentum (and mass) from a binary companion. Here 
again the important objects are compact. For the spin angular velocity 12 cannot 
be so large that centrifugal force exceeds gravity at the equator of the star: 
i.e. 
R.122 < GM 
~ R~ * 
(8) 
GM 
< 
(O). 
Thus the maximum rotational energy which can be stored is 
I12 ~ 
Zrot(max) = 
2 
(10) 
where the moment of inertia I is given by k2MR2., with k < 1 the radius of 
gyration. Hence 
k ~ GM 2 
Er°t(max) ~ 2 
R. ' 
(11) 
which is of the order of the binding energy. 
The most spectacular example of this is provided by the radio pulsars, which 
are rapidly rotating neutron stars. Some of them have periods of milliseconds, 
implying that they are near the limit (11). Some of the millisecond pulsars are 
observed to have close companions, while even the presently isolated ones may 
have been spun up by a companion star which has now disappeared. 

164 
2. Accreting 
Binaries 
2.1. The Sizes of Binaries 
We shall consider close binaries in which a compact primary star of mass M1 
accretes from a secondary or donor star of mass M2; we write the total binary 
mass as M = M1 -t- M2. In almost all cases one can measure the binary period 
P. Binaries are relatively easy to study because this directly gives an idea of the 
size of the binary: the orbital semi-major axis (stellar separation for a circular 
orbit) a is given by Kepler's third law as 
GMP ~ 
a 3 = 
-
-
 
(19). 
47r 2 
It is convenient to write ml = M1/Mo, m2 = M2/Mo, m = M/Mo, 
and 
Phr, Pday for the binary period measured in hours or days respectively. Then 
a ~_ O.5Rom 1/3 PIll 3 -~ 3.5 X 101°m 1/3`p2/3hr cm, 
(13) 
giving the typical size of CVs and some low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), 
which have periods of a few hours. For massive X-ray binaries 
a " 40R®(m/lO)l/3(pday/lO)2/3 ~ 2.9 X lO12(rn/lO)l/a(pday/lO)2/3 
cm (14). 
/ 
These estimates show £hat in CVs and LMXBs with P = a few hours, a lower 
main-sequence secondary star (//2 < R®) will occupy a large fraction of the 
binary orbit, while in massive XRBs with P = days a giant or supergiant donor 
(R2 ,,, several Ro) will do this. From (5) we know that the typical luminosities 
Lace ".1033 - 1034 erg s -1 and 103s - 103s erg s -1 in CVs and X-ray binaries, 
respectively, require accretion rates J~/= -M2 of order 1016-101T g s -1 (10 -l°- 
10-9 Mo y-l) for CVs and 1016 - 10 Is g s -1 (10 -l° - 10 -8 M O y-l) for X-ray 
binaries. In Sections 5 and 6 we will discuss how such rates of mass transfer can 
arise. 
2.2. The Eddington Limit 
In all cases we know that there is a limit to the steady accretion luminosity; if this 
becomes too large its radiation pressure will inhibit further accretion. Consider 
matter accreting on to a star of mass Ml, at a distance r from its centre. If the 
luminosity is L the electrons in this matter will each feel a radiation pressure 
force

outwards, where aT is the Thomson cross-section• However the electrons are 
unable to separate entirely from the positive ions in the flow because overall 
electrical neutrality will be maintained by Coulomb forces• For normal cosmic 

165 
matter (mostly hydrogen) there will be about one proton per electron; hence the 
gravitational force opposing Era d will be 
GM1 
GMlmp 
(15) 
Since both Frad and Fsr~v scale as r -2, steady accretion is evidently only possible 
if 
4~rG M1 mpc 
L < LEdd ~ 
~ 103sin1 erg s -1. 
(16) 
fiT 
It is worth making three points about LEdd. 
(a) The restriction L < LEdd only holds in a steady state (it is violated by 
many orders of magnitude in a supernova explosion for example). 
(b) The precise value of LEdd depends on the chemical composition, i.e. the 
mean mass per electron. 
(c) The limit clearly applies also to the intrinsic stellar luminosity also: com- 
bined with the upper main-sequence mass-luminosity relation L c¢ M 3 it leads 
to an upper mass limit M <~ 60M 0 for main-sequence stars. 
3. Tidal Effects 
In most close binaries the orbit is circular and any extended stellar component 
(typicMly the secondary) rotates synchronously. The first of these results follows 
from a basic principle of Kepler orbits which we shall invoke several times in 
these notes: 
the orbit of lowes~ energy for a given angular momentum is a circle. 
Thus if the binary orbit is eccentric (and the rotation of the secondary neces- 
sarily asynchronous), the varying stellar separation will cause tides to be raised 
in this star. This flexing must lead to dissipation (via e.g. viscosity) and conse- 
quent energy loss, usually on a timescale much shorter than angular momentum 
can be lost from the binary orbit. Thus the binary will reduce its energy to the 
minimum allowed by its angular momentum, thus circularizing the orbit. If the 
secondary is not synchronous, tides will cause further dissipation until it exactly 
corotates with the binary. In this state everything rotates rigidly in space and 
there is no further dissipation. Even if angular xnomentuna is gradually lost from 
the binary orbit, the timescales for circularization and synchronization are suf- 
ficiently short that it is generally always a good approximation to regard the 
binary orbit as circular and the secondary as synchronously rotating. Note that 
this is not true of the compact primary star, where tides are ineffective. 
A further simplification is that we can usually regard both stars as mass 
points for dynamical purposes. Any gas flow in the binary can then be treated 
as test particle motion under the combined gravity of the two rotating mass 
points: this is known as the restricted 3-body problem. 

166 
4. The Roche Potential 
The restricted 3-body problem is usually treated by adopting a reference frame 
rotating with the binary; neglecting Coriolis forces we can combine the gravi- 
tational avid centrifugal forces per unit mass as -VOrt, where ~/irt, the Roche 
potential, is given by 
GM1 
GM2 
1 
~rt= 
Ir-rxl 
Ir-r21 
~(wAr) 2 
(17) 
where w is the binary rotation vector, with w = 2rc/P. The great advantage of 
• rt is that, as usual, we can get considerable insight into gas motions simply by 
studying the equipotential surfaces rather than having to solve the equations of 
motion. In particular, the sections of these equipotentials in the orbital plane, 
shown in Fig.l, give direct insight into when mass transfer occurs. 
The scale of the equipotential pattern is set by the binary separation a, and 
the precise shapes by the mass ratio q = M2/M1. The stationary points of ~/i R 
satisfy V~R = 0 and are called the Lagrange points. The most important of these 
is the inner Lagrange point L1, which is a saddle point. It plays the role of a 
high mountain pass between the two deep valleys around each of the mass points 
MI, Ms, which are called the Roche lobes (the two parts of the figure-of-eight 
equipotential 2 of Fig.l). 
5. Roche Lobe Overflow 
5.1. Occurrence 
The mass transfer process in close binaries is determined by the relation of the 
sizes of the stars to their Roche lobes. Three generic situations are possible. 
(a) Detached. Both stars are smaller than their Roche lobes: mass has to 
climb a considerable potential barrier to leave either of the stars. Mass transfer 
can only occur if one of the stars has a strong wind, and is likely to be inefficient 
(see Section 6). 
(b) Semi-detached. One of the stars fills its Roche lobe: because L1 is a 
saddle point the gas here pours through into the other star's Roche lobe and is 
all captured by this star. Because the mass is removed on a dynamical timescale 
a star can never get much bigger than its Roche lobe (see Sect 5.2). 
(c) Contact. Both stars fill their Roche lobes. What happens in this case is 
rather unclear, but in any case this case does not occur for compact stars. 
Case (a) includes all wide binaries, as well as some high-mass X-ray bina- 
ries. Case (b) covers contact binaries such as the W UMa systems. The most 
interesting case applying to CVs, LMXBs, and some high-mass X-ray binaries 
is the semi-detached case (b). Long-lived efficient mass transfer will ensue if the 
extended star in a compact binary fills its Roche lobe. This can occur in one of 
two ways: the star may expand for reasons connected with its internal structure, 
such as the expansion towards the giant branch at the end of main-sequence 

167 
Fig. 1. Sections in tile orbital plane of the Roche equipotentials ~R = constant, for 
a binary with mass ratio q = M2/MI = 0.25. Stationary points of the potential are 
marked LI - L5 and the centre of mass as CM. The equipotentials are labelled 1 - 4 
in order of increasing~R. The inner Lagrange point L1 is a saddle point, acting as a 
'pass' between tile two Roche lobes, the two parts of the figure-of-eight equipotentiai 
2. The full equipotential surfaces are approximately given by rotating the figure around 
the line of eentres M1 -/14"2 
evolution; or the binary may shrink under angular momentum loss, reducing a 
and hence the size of the Roche equipotentials. We shall examine these cases in 
detail later 
To make our considerations precise we need an expression for the secondary's 
Roche lobe; as a suitable measure we take the radius R2 of a sphere occupying 
the same volume. By the remarks in Sect. 4 above we expect R2/a to be purely a 
function of the mass ratio q. For q ~< 1, the important case for CVs and LMXBs, 
a tolerable approximation is that of Pacz3~nski: 
/ 
\1/3 
(M~)l/3 
R"-~ = 0.462 ~ l~q ) 
= 0.462 -~- 
(18) 
This form gives a simple relation between the period P and the mean density # 
of a secondary which fills the Roche lobe:

Thus assuming a structure for the lobe-filling star fixes it uniquely: if it is on 
the lower main sequence for example, the approximate mass-radius relation

5.2. Tile Degree of Roche Lobe Filling 
Clearly a star does not have a sharp edge, and the phrase "filling the Roche 
lobe" is necessarily imprecise. If AR is the difference RL -- R., where RL is the 
position of the Roche lobe (say near LI) and R. is some reference level (e.g. 
the photosphere) in the star, a study of the gas flow near L1 shows (e.g. Ritter, 
1988) that the instantaneou.~ mass overflow rate through L, is 
-IQ~_ CM~e ,an/g 
(25) 
tdyn 
where tdy n is the star's dynamical time, H its scaleheight near L1, and C a con- 
stant depending on the choice of reference level. We see that unless the argument 
of the exponential is very large and negative the star would lose most of its mass 
on a very short timescale (of order the binary period). This is not surprising: if 
AR were small, the star's atmosphere would significantly exceed its Roche lobe, 
and its mass would simply "fall off" towards its companion. Thus AR is always 
small compared with R~ and a star can never be much bigger than its Roche 
lobe. 
Since the quantity AR/H is large, --~/2 is .extremely sensitive to AR: chang- 
ing AR by of order a scaleheight changes -M2 by large factors. Reversing the 
argument, we see that AR is very insensitive to the value of the mass transfer 
rate -M2, determined in the long term by evolutionary expansion of the star or 

169 
angular momentum losses. Hence the star can accomodate itself to any imposed 
mass transfer rate by small adjustments of AR; for most purposes we can regard 
its radius as exactly equal to that of its Roche lobe. Thus if mass transfer is 
driven by angular momentum loss (f/L <: 0), R, will be forced to shrink at least 
as quickly to prevent AR decreasing too much, i.e. to keep the mass transfer 
stable. Conversely, if mass transfer is driven by evolutionary expansion of the 
star (/~. > 0), stable mass transfer will occur if the changes of a and q resulting 
from the overflow are sufficient to nmve the Roche lobe out at least as quickly. 
5.3. Driving Mass Transfer 
Mass transfer in a binary changes its orbital elements and hence the Roche lobe 
radius: for long-lived mass transfer the driving mechanism must be able to keep 
the star in contact with the lobe. Generally tides are able to keep the binary 
orbit circular, so the behaviour of M2, R2 etc is determined by that of the orbital 
angular momentum 
We assume that all the mass lost from star 2 is aecreted by star 1 (i.e. /V/ = 
-~/1 + -~/2 = 0). Then logarithmic differentiation of eq. (26) gives 
= 
j 
(27) 
showing how the separation and binary period change on mass transfer. Now 
1/3 
logarithmically differentiating (18) in the form R2 cc M 2 a and combining with 
(27) gives 
/~ 
2J 
2(-,~/2) (~ 
M2) 
(28) 
n2- 
In conservative mass transfer, i.e. /V/= J; = 0, we see that the sign of h (and 
/~ ) is the same as that of the quantity 1 - q (q = M2/M1), while the sign of 
/~2 is the same as that of 5/6 - q. If q > 5/6 mass transfer causes the Roche 
lobe to shrink; this will cause further mass transfer unless the star shrinks still 
more rapidly. Frequently this cannot happen, for example if the star has a deep 
convective envelope, and the case q > 5/6 is unstable in the sense described in 
Sect. 5.2. Conversely, the case q < 5/6 is usually stable; however in this case 
J/2 > 0, so the lobe expands: mass transfer can only be sustained if the star 
expands, usually as a result of nuclear evolution, say from the main sequence to 
the giant branch. 
For periods P ~ day the binary is not wide enough to contain an evolved 
star, so mass transfer must be non-conservative (J < 0). If we know a mass- 
radius relation for the lobe-filling star, (28) immediately tells the average mass 
transfer rate driven by whatever angular momentum loss process operates. For 

170 
example if the mass-losing star is close to the main sequence, so that R2 0¢ M2, 
(28) becomes

we see that in both cases mass is transferred on the angular-momentum-loss 
timescale; the denominators 4/3 - q, 2/3 - q arc fairly close to 1 except near the 
mass transfer stability limits q = 4/3, 2/3, so that -l~/Is/M2 ,,, -J/J on both 
eases. 
We shall consider various forms of angular momentum loss processes in these 
notes, but one which is present in all binaries (though only effective at short peri- 
ods) is gravitational quadrupole radiation. This general relativistic effect extracts 
angular momentum at the logarithmic rate

(e.g. Landau and Lifschitz, 1958). For the main'sequence or degenerate secon- 
daries considered above, we can use the Roche lobe relation a cx RsM~ 1/3 to- 
gether with the mass-radius relations Rs o¢ M2, R2 o¢ M~ 1/s and the resulting 
mass-period relations M2 (x P, Ms c( p-I (22, 24) to get (e.g. King, 1988)

(32) 
and 
-.~/s(degen, GR) ~ 1.6 x 10 -is 
Moy -1, 
(33) 
with hydrogen content X = 0.6 in the latter equation. In principle we could 
replace P in these equations by Ms and M~ 1 respectively and integrate to 
find M2(t). However we must remember that (32) and (33) were derived assum- 
ing main-sequence and degenerate-sequence mass-radius relations. The effect of 
mass loss on these stars may indeed bc to cause them to deviate from these ideal 
relations. For example, if (32) predicts that mass is removed from the star on a 
timescale shorter than its thermal tlmescale, the star will not be able to shrink 
back to the thermal-equilibrium (i.e main-sequence) radius appropriate to its 
new smaller mass rapidly enough, and will remain progressively more and more 
oversized for its mass compared with its main-sequence radius. We shall see in 
Sect 12 that such effects play a major part in the evolution of close binaries. 
We note finally that although the average mass transfer rate may be deter- 
mined by evolutionary expansion or angular momentum loss from the binary as 
in (32, 33), quite large fluctuations around this value will occur if for example 

171 
the star's surface oscillates; the evolutionary average of -.~/2 will be established 
only over a timescale such that the Roche lobe moves relative to the star by a 
distance of order the scaleheight H. As this time can be >~ 105 y in many binaries 
it is clear that we should not necessarily expect the observed mass transfer rate 
in a given system to be close to the evolutionary mean. 
6. Stellar Wind 
Accretion 
If the companion star does not fill the Roche lobe, mass transfer can only occur 
via mass loss with velocities > orbital, which are necessarily highly supersonic. 
There are two main cases involving compact primary stars. 
6.1. OB Supergiant X-ray Binaries 
These have periods P ~ 10 days, with a neutron star or black hole in an orbit 
which almost skims the surface of a massive OB supergiant. The neutron star 
systems frequently show pulsed X-ray emission, indicating that the neutron star 
is strongly magnetized and modulates the X-rays at its rotation period. The OB 
star loses mass at a rate -~/w "~ 10 -5 M®Y -1, with wind velocities Vw "-~ a few 
1000 km s -1. This evolutionary stage must be very short-lived (-.- 104 y) as the 
OB star is close to filling its Roche lobe: once this happens the binary will be 
engulfed and turn off as an X-ray source, as the mass-losing star is more massive 
than the compact primary, and Roche lobe overflow is unstable (see Section 5). 
6.2. Be-star X-ray Binaries 
Here the neutron star (again frequently magnetic) has a much longer (,,~ 100 d) 
orbit; pulse-timing measurements show some of these orbits to have appreciable 
eccentricities (e > 0.3). Not surprisingly, the X-ray emission is often episodic, 
corresponding probably to periastron passage of the neutron star. Mass loss 
from Be stars is more complicated than from OB supergiants. While they do 
have high-velocity winds like the latter, the distinctive feature of Be stars seems 
to be a slow (Vw ~< few × 102 km s -1) wind in the rotational equatorial plane 
(e.g. Waters and van Kerkwijk, 1989). 
6.3. Mass and Angular Momentum Capture in Wind Accretion 
Since wind material by definition is able to escape the mass-losing star quite 
easily, only a small and rather uncertain fraction is captured by the compact 
star. The angular momentum capture rate is even harder to estimate as it is 
sensitive to very minor readjustments of the wind flow near this star. 
On simple energetic grounds it is usual to assume that the compact star cap- 
tures most of the wind matter passing within the cylindrical "accretion radius"

the orbit of the compact star). For OB .supergiant X-ray binaries ~ ~ 4r and 
Vrel '~ Vw, leading to accretion rates M1 ~ 10 -s Mo y-1. In Be-star X-ray 
binaries the mass loss in the high-velocity spherical wind is too low to drive 
significant accretion rates; since Vw "~ Vorb is much lower in the equatorial wind 
it is probably this which drives the observed accretion rates ~< 10 -s M o y-l, 
the lower mass-loss rate/V/w being compensated by the smaller solid angle 2. 
If the wind material were uniformly distributed before encountering the bow- 
shock a simple argument (Illarionov and Sunyaev, 1975; Shapiro and Lightman, 
1976) shows that the accreted matter would have specific angular momentum

with an efficiency factor r/= 1. However numerical treatments of the flow, while 
very difficult, generally agree on a rather small value r/~ 0.05 (Livio et al. 1986; 
Blondin et aL 1990 and references therein), because of gravitational focussing. 
There is some indication that the actual accretion flow may be time-dependent, 
with the compact star accreting opposite signs of angular momentum alternately. 
7. The Fate of the Accreted 
Matter 
The nature of gravitational energy release from the infalling matter depends 
strongly on its flow geometry. Once the matter is captured, we can to a good ap- 
proximation neglect the influence of the secondary and regard the gas as flowing 
in the potential of the primary alone. Clearly the gas will rapidly become highly 
supersonic as it falls freely under this potential, so at least initially is will follow 
ballistic trajectories. In the single--star potential these are just Kepler orbits, 
fixed by the specific energy and angular momentum of the gas. 

173 
7.1. Roche Lobe Overflow 
Here the near-sonic velocity through L1 is much smaller than the velocities 
acquired through free fall, so the initial conditions at L1 are rapidly forgotten 
by the gas, which all follows essentially the same near-parabolic (zero-energy) 
orbit. The distance of closest approach to the primary, Rmin, is fixed by the 
angular momentum: it is easy to show that Rmin 
1 
= ~Rcirc , where Reirc is the 
radius of a circular Kepler orbit with the same angular momentum: this is called 
the circularization radius. Evidently if Rmin < R1, the radius of the primary, the 
gas will crash directly into the accreting star; this is thought to occur in some 
Algol systems. By contrast if Rmin > R1 the gas will have to orbit the star, and 
must lose angular momentum if it is to accrete. 
The specific orbital angular momentum fixing Rmi n and Reir¢ can be esti- 
mated quite simply by neglecting the gas velocity through L1, and regarding the 
gas as being "dropped" from L1 with an initial velocity resulting purely from 
the binary rotation. If bl is the distance of L1 from the centre of the primary 
this means that the gas specific angular momentum is b~w; the definition of Rcir¢ 
requires this to be equal to (GM1 Rcirc) 1/2. Using Kepler's law for the binary we 
have w 2 = GM/a 3, and hence 
=M 
bl 
3, 
Numerical results for Roche geometry can be fitted by the formula 
so that we finally get 
(38) 
•Lcirc = (1 + q)[0.500- 0.227 log q]4. 
(40) 
a 
One can evaluate this equation for a range of parameters, and a simple result 
emerges. For q = 1.0 we find Rmin ~ a/16, and for q = 0.1 we get Rmin - a/8. 
Using (13) we see that in all realistic cases Rmin is larger than the size of any 
compact object, which cannot exceed the radius of a low-mass white dwarf 
(,~ 109 cm). Hence in general Roche lobe overflow results in the infalling gas 
missing the accreting compact star. Since the gas is trapped in this star's Roche 
lobe and must move alomst in the orbital plane it is clear that the gas trajectories 
will intersect themselves. These collisions of supersonic gas streams must produce 
significant dissipation, so that the gas will lose energy ultimately to radiation. 
Generally speaking the timescale for energy loss is much shorter than that for 
any redistribution of angular momentum within the gas, which therefore loses 
energy at nearly constaalt angular momentum. We may thus invoke the principle 
enunciated in Sect. 3. and assert that the gas will initially try to follow a circular 
orbit consistent with its original angular momentum, i.e. at Rcire. Evidently this 
ring of matter must try to rid itself of angular momentum in order to accrete. As 
the accompanying energy loss will in practice usually be much more rapid, the

(39) 
a 

174 
matter will be gently lowered on to the central star through a sequence of circular 
orbits. This constitutes an accretion disc: we see that such discs are a general 
consequence of Roche lobe overflow on to a compact star. The one exception to 
this general conclusion is the case where the central star has a strong magnetic 
moment. In practice this means a white dwarf, which cml have moments # as 
high as 1034 Gcm 3. For binaries of sufficiently small separation (short periods, 
<~ 4 hr) the field can prevent disc formation entirely. Systems of this type are 
known (the AM Herculis stars), and form a fascinating subgroup of their own. 
7.2. Stellar Wind Accretion 
The clearcut picture of disc formation in Roche lobe overflow does not extend to 
disc accretion. We have seen already (Sect. 6.3) that the mass and angular mo- 
mentum capture in this case are quite uncertain. If we adopt the simple estimate 
(37) of the captured angular momentum and try to compute a circularization 
radius we find 
R¢ir¢ = 47r2G3M~ 
2 
s 
(41) 
PorbVrel 
This is to be compared with the obstacle presented by the accreting object. In 
many cases of wind accretion this is a strongly magnetic neutron star, so if the 
estimate (41) were not already uncertain enough (a 10°~ change in Vrel alters 
Relic by a factor 2) we have to add the uncertainties of how the magnetic field 
interacts with the flow. In any case, the estimate (41) is naive, as (37) is unlikely 
to be accurate. In view of these uncertainties it is hardly surprising that no clear 
picture of accretion from a stellar has yet emerged. Numerical computations of 
such flows have so far been confined to 2D or rather low-resolution 3D modelling. 
These suggest that the average angular momentum of the flow is insufficient to 
form a disc; however it is possible that the accreting object receives opposite signs 
of angular momentum at different epochs, leading to transient disc formation (see 
e.g. Blondin et al. 1990; Livio 1991 and references therein). 
8. Accretion Discs 
We have seen that the formation of an accretion disc is the normal consequence 
of Roche lobe overflow in close binaries. There are many other astrophysical sit- 
uations in which matter has to rid itself of angular momentum in order to sink 
deeper in a potential well, and these too are likely to give rise to discs. Accord- 
ingly there is now a vast literature on discs in all contexts, including notably 
star formation and active galactic nuclei. However the binary case remains the 
best understood and in some sense is treated as a paradigm. A full review of the 
subject would require far more space than is available here, so the present Sec- 
tion attempts only a brief introduction. The interested reader is referred to the 
book by Frank et al. (1992) and references therein for more detailed treatments. 

175 
The disc is taken as a flattened configuration lying close to the orbital plane 
z = 0 in cylindrical coordinates (R, ¢, z). By the arguments of Sect. 7 we as- 
sume the matter to accrete through a sequence of circular orbits R = constant; 
frequently these will be Kepler orbits, with azimuthal velocity v÷ = RI2 = 
(GM1/R) ~/2. We assume that the "vertical" velocity component Vz is negligible, 
and that the radial "drift" velocity VR is << Iv¢l. Clearly for accretion to occur 
we require vR < 0 near the central object. We characterize the matter by its 
surface density 
/? 
Z(R,t) = 
pdz 
(42) 
oo 
where p is the local matter density. Armed with these assumptions we can write 
down conservation equations for mass and angular momentum describing the 
radial structure of accretion discs. The mass of the annulus between r and r+AR 
is 27rRAR~, and mass flows across the curved boundaries of the annulus at local 
rates 27rR2~vR. Hence 
or 
O(27rRAR57) 
= 
[ 
]n+zan 
-- [27rRZ'vr] R 
Ot + 
(R27vn) = 0 
(43) 
The angular momentum equation is very similar, with X' being replaced by 
~TR2J2 everywhere, except that there must be transport by viscous torques be- 
tween tumuli. If G(R, t) is the viscous torque of an outer annulus on an inner 
one, we get 
R 
(27R212) + 
(RZvRR212) - 27r OR 
We can exploit the similarity with the mass conservation to eliminate the quan- 
tity R~'vR, arriving at 
0 
1 
OG 
R 02~-~= ~-R[27r(/~212),-~ ] 
(45) 
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to R. 
8.1. Viscosity 
Given a prescription for G in terms of S etc, eqn.(45) will determine 27(R, t). 
Specifying the viscosity is the cruciM part of the accretion disc problem. Without 
viscosity there can be no disc: this is physicMly obvious, since there would be 
no angular momentum transport, and follows from the equations above if we 
set G = 0, which implies vR = 0, i.e. no mass flow. In fact the viscosity has to 
perform three related functions: circularizing the gas orbits, transporting angular 

176 
momentum, and dissipating energy. Yet we have no real understanding of this 
basic driving process, and disc theory has no predictive power except in certain 
limits; in particular our picture of time-dependent disc evolution lacks a firm 
basis. This is analogous to the position of stellar structure theory in the 1920s, 
before thermonuclear energy generation was understood. While the ingenuity 
of astronomers nevertheless produced a remarkable amount of progress, a full 
outline of stellar evolution in particular had to await this discovery. 
The term "viscosity" usually implies the existence of random motions about 
the mean streaming velocity, and this at least provides a simple picture to fix 
ideas. If the random motions have a typical scale A and velocity v ~, an elementary 
argument (e.g. Frank et al. 1992) shows that they will transport momentum 
along the velocity gradient of a shearing flow: if we have a linear flow field 
v(R) orthogonal to the R direction, the resulting force per unit length between 
adjacent streamlines is 
Ov 
where X' is the surface density of the flow. We can express this as saying that 
the fluid has kinematic viscosity [cm s -1] u --~ Sv'. 
For a rotating flow the arguments go through similarly; the rate of angular 
momentum transport orthogonal to a shearing flow v = RI2(R) involves the 
angular velocity gradient if; thus the torque of an outer disc annulus on an 
inner one is 
G(R, t) = 2rcRv~R2J2 ' 
(46) 
Obviously the torque of an inner annulus on an outer one is just -G, and 
the net torque on a ring between radii R, R + AR is 
-~-~ A- 
(47) 
8.2. Viscous Dissipation 
From (47) the rate of working of the viscosity on a ring is (angular velocity x 
torque) = 
OG 
12-~-RAR = [ o~(J2G) - GI2'] AR. 
But here the term O(f2G)/OR is not a local term, as is clear from its form 
as a divergence: in an integral over the whole disc, this term would produce 
• 
• 
outer 
edge 
• 
• 
• 
a contrlbuhon [$2G]i,ner edge depending only on boundary conditions. We can 
identify this term as the rate of advection of rotational energy by the viscous 
torques. The other term -GO' in the square bracket of this equation is clearly 
local in origin, and gives the rate at which the viscosity dissipates the kinetic 
energy of the fluid, i.e. turns it into heat, which is then radiated from the disc. 

177 
This is the prime observable quantity; since most of the radiation is from the 
flat faces of the disc, we express it as the dissipation rate per unit face area, 
D(R, t) = GY2'Ar/47rRAR, since the disc has two faces, so that 
D(n,t) =  .C(2m1) 
(48). 
We note that D(_R, t) > O, vanishing only for rigid rotation Y2(R) = constant. 
8.3. The Magnitude of Viscosity 
All of the above discussion has avoided any direct identification of what processes 
might produce the raaldom motions giving rise to u. It is clear that ordinary 
"molecular" (atomic) viscosity, where A is the collisional mean free path and 
v I the sound speed, is far too small to cause noticeable angular momentum 
transport on timescales of interest: the resulting Reynolds number 
Rv~ 
Rv¢, 
(49) 
~e = 
~v I ". 
v 
is of order 1014 . This very large value is sometimes taken as an indication that the 
disc flow is turbulent, so that u would then be the eddy viscosity corresponding to 
the largest eddy scales, although there is no proof of this. There are several other 
candidate mechanisms, e.g. local magnetic fields, or spiral shocks (see Morrill et 
al. 1991 for a recent review of the latter). None of these has yet attained the 
state of making firm quantitative predictions that can be compared successfully 
with observational data. The most fruitful approach has been to bound the 
likely values of A and v'. If the viscosity is assumed to result from turbulent 
eddies, we can assert that these are unlikely to exceed the disc semi-thickness H 
by very much; further, except in restricted regions the motions cannot be very 
supersonic, as shocks will quickly reducc them to subsonic. Thus we can set 
v = a~es 
(50) 
and hope that the dimensionless parameter a is < 1. This approach, pioneered 
by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) can be applied to other candidate mechanisms 
with similar results. It is very important to realise that there is no reason at all to 
suppose a to be constant in time or space; apart from the reasonable expectation 
that a ~< 1, (50) gains us nothing. Nevcrtheless the a-parametrization is useful in 
allowing numerical estimates, and it is customary to discuss suggested viscosity 
mechanisms in terms of their effective alphas.

9. Disc Structure 
The form (46) inserted in (45) shows that 27 obeys a nonlinear diffusion equation 
3 
(51). 
= n On \ 
On[ 
'/ 
Given a form of v and suitable boundary conditions this equation determines 
~'(R, t), and vR can be read off from the mass conservation equation as 
v~= 
2R112 
[v2R'/~ l 
(52). 
The diffusive behaviour suggested by (51) is clearly visible in simple analytic 
solutions, e.g. for the unrealistic case v = constant: an initial ring of matter 
spreads to both larger and small R under the viscous torques, the inward- 
secreting matter losing angular momentum to the small fraction of the mass 
which moves outwards. The form of the equation shows that matter diffuses 
locally on the viscous timescalc 
l 2 
/] 
where l = ,U/[V~ I is the local density scalelength. Thus a concentrated matter 
distribution spreads rapidly, while a more uniform one relaxes slowly. It is easy 
to see from (52) that tvisc can be re-expressed as --~ l/vR. 
9.1. Steady Discs 
In many cases the disc flow is steady on timescale of interest: setting O/Ot = 0 
the mass conservation equation gives 
2rRE(-vn) = M 
(54) 
where .~r is the (constant) accretion rate. The diffusion equation (51) has steady 
solutions of the form 
B 
v~ = A + R1/z 
(55) 
where A, B are constants. We see from (52) and (54) that the A-solutions cor- 
respond to steady inflow at a rate .~/ --- 37rA and the B-solutions to no flow 
at all (vR = 0). It is easy to show (e.g. Frank et aL 1992) that the solution 
corresponding to steady accretion on to a non-rotating star of radius R. is 
= 
(56) 
This solution has the property that the maximum of Y2(R) is the Kepler value 
very close to R.; Y2 then decreases rapidly towards zero at the stellar surface in a 

179 
narrow boundary layer. Solutions with B > 0 and A = 0 correspond to situations 
in which the disc does not accrete at all but simply extracts rotational energy 
from the central star (the propellor effect). 
Surface Dissipation of Steady Discs 
Equation (48) shows that a Keplerian disc has surface dissipation rate 
9 
GM1 
(57) 
D( R) = -~uZ -~ . 
Because this depends only on the combination u22 we see from (55) that in 
steady discs the surface dissipation is independent of viscosity. In particular for 
the solution (56) corresponding to accretion on to a non-rotating star we have 
3~'/~'1/~[1-- (--~)1/2] 
(58) 
D(R)- V;~ 
Defining the disc effective temperature T~tr(R) through the relation D(R) = aT~f r 
we find 
Terr(R) o¢ R -3/4 
(59) 
for R >> R,. This relation is effectively independent of the inner boundary 
condition, and so provides a stringent test of steady disc theory. Eclipse mapping 
of discs in cataclysmic variables (see Home 1991 for a review) confirms this 
dependence in cases where we can be sure that the disc is steady and optically 
thick (so that Tear is easy to estimate from observation). This is important, as a 
failure here could not be ascribed to our ignorance of viscosity. 
Boundary Layers 
We have already alluded to the presence of a boundary layer around the accreting 
star in some cases. The total disc luminosity 
Rout 
D( R)27r RdR, 
Ldisc = 2jR" 
where Rout >> R, is the outer disc radius, is only one-half of the accretion 
luminosity, i.e. 
G M11~I 
Ldlsc = 
2R, 
(60) 
This is easy to understand, in that matter in Keplerian rotation near R. has one- 
half of the binding energy of mattcr which has accreted to the non-rotating star. 
The result suggests that the boundary layer might be as bright as the disc under 
certain circumstances. EUV observations of non-magnetic cataclysmic variables 
do not show much evidence for the widespread prescnce of such boundary layers. 

180 
This may be because the accreting white dwarfs are rapidly spun up to near- 
Kepler velocities, considerably reducing the boundary layer luminosity (King ct 
al. 1991). 
9.2 Vertical Disc Structure 
We have so far simply assumed that the disc is thin in the vertical direction, i.e. 
H << R at each radius. We should now check this. There is hydrostatic balance 
in the z-direction between the pressure gradient and the tidal gravitational field: 
OP 
GM1 z 
0--z- -~ 
R 3 p 
(61) 
To get an estimate of H we set z ~., H, OP/Oz ,.~ P/H, and express P as pc~. 
Then 
H 
cs 
(62) 
R 
vh" 
where vg is the Kepler velocity at R. This shows that the disc is thin if and 
only if the Kepler velocity is highly supersonic. A simple order-of-magnitude 
analysis of the radial Euler (momentum) equation readily shows that in this 
case the gas velocity v~ must be very close to vh', so that the radial momentum 
balance is supplied by centrifugal force and not pressure. Thus we see that the 
disc is thin if and only if it is Keplerian, which in turn will hold provided that 
the disc cooling is efficent enough always to keep cs < < vK. 
If the disc is thin at each radius, we can treat the vertical structure at fixed 
R just like that of a one-dimensional star, with viscous heating playing the role 
of nuclear energy generation in a star. In particular the vertical energy transport 
through the disc may be by convection or radiation. In the latter case the internal 
disc temperature T(z) will vary as 
1 
T N rl/--- 7 
(63) 
where 7- o¢ z is the Rosseland mean optical depth, provided that most of the 
viscous energy generation take place near the disc mid-plane. 
10. Disc Stability 
We have implicitly assumed above that a steady mass supply leads to steady disc 
flow. In fact this may not always be possible, and is a suggested cause of dwarf 
nova outbursts. There is good observational evidence that discs are present in 
these cataclysmic systems, and that the observed outbursts (luminosity increases 
by f~ctors ~ 10 in about a day, declining over several days, with intervals of weeks 
between outbursts) are caused by increased accretion. The key to this type of 
behaviour is tile possibility of two stable types of vertical disc structure (Fig. 

181 
2b). At fixed radius R we plot the quantity v2~ (or T~f r or the local mass-flow 
rate ,~/(R)) against surface density Z'.

Fig. 2. Effective temperature versus surface density at fixed radius in an accretion 
disc. In (a) there is a unique stable steady solution (To, Z'0), while in (b) the steady 
solution lies on an unstable branch of the curve. The systems executes limit cycles 
B-C-D-E 
It is easy to show that to the right of the equilibrium curve viscous heating 
dominates over radiative cooling, with the opposite behaviour to the left of the 
curve. Hence where the curve has positive slope the structure is stable against 
thermal perturbations, but no equilibrium is possible on any part of the curve 
where the slope is negative. If the curve always has a positive slope as in Fig. 2a 
there is a unique stable solution. However, if the curve has the S shape shown 
in Fig. 2b there are two stable branches separated by an unstable one. If the 
external mass transfer rate into the disc corresponds to an equilibrium on this 
braalch, the system will be forced to execute limit cycles around this point: on the 
lower stable branch mass accumulates in the ring faster than it flows out, as the 
viscosity is low at these low temperatures. The surface density thus rises until 
the "knee" at the upper end of the stable branch is reached. Here equilibrium is 
no longer possible and the annulus jumps to the high-temperature branch at the 
same density on a local thermal timescale. Here the viscosity is high, and mass 
flows out of the ring more rapidly than it arrives, reducing the surface density 
until the ring drops back into the low-temperature equilibrium state. The ring 
evidently alternates between a long-lived state of low temperature and mass 
flow, and a short-lived state of high temperature and mass flow, the transitions 
between the states being fairly rapid. This is clem-ly qualitatively similar to 
observed dwarf nova behaviour. The origin of the S-shape can plausibly be 
ascribed to the rapid increase of hydrogen opacity with temperature near 10 4 K: 
just below the critical temperature, a local injection of heat raises the opacity, 
and thus traps more heat leading to a further temperature rise. Conversely, just 
above the critical temperature slight cooling causes a draanatic opacity decrease, 
allowing heat to escape more freely. 
There are several problems in accepting such disc instability models of dwarf 
nova outbursts. First, the instability described here is purely local, i.e. at one R. 

182 
To achieve a global instability requires that local instability at one radius triggers 
instability at other radii. By suitable choice of parameters this can be arranged. 
But in order to obtain wide enough outbursts it is necessary to manipulate the 
parameter, raising it on the hot branch above its value on the cool branch. One 
could argue that there is nothing sacred about holding c~ fixed. But one might 
counter that with a free function at one's disposal, the ability to fit dwarf nova 
outburst light curves is not necessarily very impressive. Of course the use of an 
c~-parametrization is inherently unsatisfactory, and a more physically motivated 
description of viscosity is urgently needed. Perhaps even more seriously, most 
of the instability calculations are essentially one-dimensional in space, whereas 
the physics of the disc is probably fully three-dimensional. In one dimension the 
instabilities must propagate as fronts through the disc, but the coherence of such 
fronts is not guaranteed in three dimensions. 
11. Discs in Other 
Binaries 
Non-magnetic cataclysmic variables provide the most direct application of ac- 
cretion disc theory. There is some encouragement for theoreticians in that basic 
predictions like the Tetr o¢ R -3/4 do seem to hold up in certain systems. Since 
comparatively little of disc theory depends crucially on the central boundary 
conditions one alight hope that it would extend straightforwardly to other bina- 
ries, in particular the low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which differ from CVs 
only in having a neutron star in place of a white dwarf. This is fax from being 
the case; the X-ray light curves of these systems show phenomena which are 
not easily reconciled with the simple picture described above (see White, 1989; 
Watson and King, 1991, for reviews). This is a severe challenge, as any model 
must also explain why these phenomena do not appear to occur in CVs. One 
can either argue that discs in LMXBs are physically different,or that these same 
phenomena occur in CVs, but are not observable in the same way. The physi- 
cal difference posited in the first approach might result from X-ray heating of 
the disc, although the radiation temperature fl'om this heating is insufficient to 
support the increased disc scale height sometimes postulated to explain the X- 
ray light curves (King, 1991). In the second approach one can argue that X-ray 
observations of LMXBs are observations of the central source and its immediate 
surroundings, and the CV analogy would be UV light curves, which have not 
been available hitherto. High time-resolution UV observations with the Hubble 
Space Telescope should settle this question. The extension of disc theory to deal 
with magnetized central stars is another difficult area: again, there is little di- 
rect evidence supporting a simple extrapolation of the standard picture sketched 
here. 

183 
12. Short-Period Binary Evolution 
This Section deal with the evolution of accreting binaries with orbital periods 
P < 12 hr (see King, 1988 for a more thorough review). There are two main 
classes: cataclysmic variables (CVs), in which a white dwarf accretes from a 
main-sequence companion, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in which the 
white dwarf is replaced by a neutron star or black hole. From (22) we see that 
the companion star must have mass M2 < 1Mo, so that evolutionary expansion 
is unlikely. The mass transfer and evolution of these binaries must be driven by 
the loss of orbital angular momentum, as discussed in Sect. 5.3. However it is 
clear that the GR mass transfer rates < 10 -1°, 10 -11 Mo yr -1 are too low for 
CVs with periods > 3 hr, where observation suggests -M2 > 5 × 10 -10 M® yr -1 
(although there is a huge dispersion in this figure). 
The favoured candidate mechanism for this angular momentum loss at peri- 
ods > 3 hr is magnetic stellar wind braking, often referred to as magnetic braking 
(MB). This is the process by which the Sun is thought to have lost most of its 
original angular momentmn. The idea basic is that the magnetic field of the Sun 
(or the secondary in a close binary) is able to force the stellar wind to corotate 
out to large radii. The resulting large specific angular momentum means that an 
insignificant mass loss rate (,,~ 10 -13 Mq) yr -I for the Sun) can carry off large 
amounts of angular momentum. Because tides lock the secondary star's rotation 
to that of the binary (see Sect. 3) this drain of angular momentum from the star 
ultimately shrinks the binary. Theories of this process (e.g. Mestel and Spruit, 
1987) suggest an angular momentum loss rate increasing with period, but con- 
tain parameters from dynamo theory for the stellar magnetic fields which cannot 
be regarded as well established. Empirical estimates from the average spin rates 
of stars in open clusters as functions of age (e.g. Skumanich, 1972) lead to a 
similar dependence (Verbunt and Zwaan, 1981). Such estimates are of order 
-Jl)/2 = JI~/'MB "~ 6 X 10 -1° \3-h-rr J 
MO yr-' 
(64) 
where 0.2 < e < 0.7. While such rates seem reasonable for CVs with P > 3 hr, 
they do not explain the rates ,v 10 -8 M® yr -1 required to drive Eddington- 
limited LMXBs. 
13. Secular 
Evolution 
of CVs 
The lack of a good theory of orbital braking for P > 3 hr (or even clinching iden- 
tification of the mechanism responsible) means that there is as yet no standard 
theory of orbital (or secular) evolution of short-period binaries. However obser- 
vational constraints on the evolution of CVs are sufficiently tight that theory 
has little room for manoeuvre, and this case is the best understood. 
We note first that the mass traalsfer rates quoted in Sect. 12 imply mass 
transfer timescales tM = M2/(-~42) < a few times 109 yr, significantly less 

184 
than the age of the Galaxy. As the binary period must change on a timescale 
-~ tM, this means that the present distribution in orbital period results from 
secular evolution, and is not simply a reflection of the initial orbital periods. 
Also it is not easy to think of observational selection effects that are strongly 
dependent on period. This explains the central importance in this field of the 
CV period histogram (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Period histograms for CVs (top) and LMXBs (bottom) (data from Ritter, 
1990). Two CVs with periods > 12 hr are not shown. The two periods between 1 and 
2 hr in the LMXB distribution are unconfirmed 
The CV period histogram reveals three main features which are all statisti- 
cally significant: 

185 
(a) an apparent long-period cutoff P ~ 10 hr 
(b) a period "gap" 2 hr < P < 3 hr 
(c) a minimum period P ,,, 80 min. 
Explanations of all three features now exist, although that for the period gap 
is still controversial. The easiest feature to explain is the maximum period (a). 
13.1. The Maximum Period 
From (22) we have a relation between the period and the mass of a lobe-filling 
main-sequence secondary star. Also, mass transfer stability (Sect. 5.3) requires 
that the secondary mass not exceed a value of order the white dwarf mass M1. 
But the latter in turn must not exceed the Ch~drasckhar limit 1.44M O. Com- 
bining these constraints we get 
P ~ rn2 x (9 hr) ~< ml x (0 hr) < 1.44 x 9 hr ~- 13 hr. 
(65) 
In fact there is also a clear selection effect against observing periods ~> 8 hr, 
as it is difficult to obtain periods in a few nights' obserwtion. 
13.2. The Minimum Period 
The explanation of the minimum period (c) is now generally accepted, and in- 
troduces ideas which are important in discussion of the period gap. In secular 
evolution M2 decreases, and from (22) this means that P decreases also, at least 
for a main-sequence secondary. But we can write (20) as 
P oc \M2] 
From this form it is obvious that while CVs generally evolve towards shorter 
periods, this is entirely dependent on the simultaneous shrinking of the stellar 
radius R2. Hence the minimum period is associated with a breakdown of the 
simple main-sequence mass-radius relation R2 e< M2. There are two reasons for 
this to occur near 80 minutes. First, as M2 decreases, the star's mass will get 
too low for it to burn hydrogen in its core, and it will try to become degenerate. 
From (24) we see that this will eventually lead to a period increase; as (22) and 
(24) intersect at a period ~ 40 minutes, CVs could not have periods less than 
this however they evolved. But in practice the minimum period will be longer 
than this because of the second type of deviation from the main-sequence mass- 
radius relation: the effect of mass loss is to make the low-mass secondary star 
oversized for its mass. A simple way of seeing this is to realise that if mass 
is lost from a star with a deep convective envelope, the surface of the star is 
"refilled" on a dynamical timescale with material from deeper within the star, 
which has slightly higher specific entropy .5/ (x log(pip't), wiLh 7 ~-- 5/3 (in a 
convective zone the entropy decreases outwards slightly). This material retains 
its original entropy, as its rise to the surface is rapid and the process is nearly 
adiabatic. But the pressure p of this material must equilibrate to that of its 

186 
surroundings on a dynamical timescale: thus its higher entropy requires the new 
surface material to have slightly lower density than the original surface material, 
which in turn means that the star is slightly larger than before the mass loss. Of 
course, the new stellar configuration is now slightly out of thermal equilibrium, 
in that the surface material has too much specific entropy, i.e. is too hot. This 
will be rectified in a fraction of the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) timescale 
tKn = - -  
(67) 
R2L2 
where L2 is the luminosity. The hotter surface layers will radiate more heat into 
space than they receive from below, ultimately from the nuclear reactions in the 
star's centre. If there is no further disturbance, the star will achieve thermal 
equilibrium once more, and adopt the main-sequence radius appropriate to its 
new smaller mass. Evidently slow mass loss will not greatly affect this conclusion. 
But if mass is removed from the star on a timescale comparable with tKn, the 
star will be unable to shrink back to its new main-sequence radius and will 
gradually become oversized for its mass. From (66) this will cause the period to 
stop decreasing. 
Near P = 80 minutes the secondary has M2 -~ 0.1M®, implying tKn ~ 2X 109 
yr, while GR alone makes tM ~ 2 X 109 yr, so this effect clearly operates. The 
main uncertainty remaining is the precise value of the minimum period: this de- 
pends sensitively on the secondary's structure, and ultimately on a knowledge of 
the low-temperature opacities which determine its surface boundary condition. 
13.3. The Period Gap 
While the CV maximum and minimum periods are reasonably well understood, 
explanations of the period gap still await confirmation. This is a direct conse- 
quence of our poor understanding of the nature of orbital braking at periods 
~> 3 hr. Note first that the gap is a ~tatistical phenomenon: there are CVs in the 
gap, their numbers consistent with being born near these periods. Thus the gap 
results from something happening to CVs as they evolve into this period range. 
If we discard the rather unlikely possibility of selection effects discriminating 
strongly against finding periods in the 2 - 3 hour range, we have essentially two 
possibilities. We can either assume that braking continues uninterruptedly when 
a CV's period decreases to ,~ 3 hr, or not. In the first case, P " 3 hr must be a 
new minimum period for CVs born at longer periods, i.e. the braking must be 
strong enough to cause a period increase to set in at this point, just as it does 
near P = 80 min. In fact (66) and (67) (with M2 ~ 0.3Mo) show that 
tM "~ tI¢it '~ 5 X l0 s yr 
(68) 
at such periods, so this is not implausible, particularly given the wide dispersion 
in mass transfer rates inferred from observation. However this would only prevent 
CVs evolving below 3 hr from longer periods: we would still need a further reason 
why CVs apparently are born with much greater frequency just below -~ 2 hr 

187 
rather than abo,~e. If instead we assume that orbitM braking is severely reduced 
(e.g. to the GR rate) near 3 hr, we get an elegant explanation for all the observed 
features of the period gap. The result (68) means that the secondary star must 
be significantly out of thermal equilibrium as a result of the rapid mass loss, and 
in particular oversized for its mass. Reducing orbital braking to the GR rate 
will make tM > tKlt; thus the star will now be able to shrink back towards its 
main-sequence radius, thus losing contact with the Roche lobe and switching off 
mass transfer. However, the star cannot shrink inside its main sequence radius, 
and orbital braking through GR alone will certainly reduce the Roche lobe size 
enough to restart mass transfer within the lifetime of the Galaxy. 
It is clear that this type of behaviour is qualitatively what is needed to 
explain the gap, provided that we can arrange the cessation of mass transfer to 
occur between ,,, 2 and 3 hr in most cases. It is clear that the sharp decrease in 
braking must occur near P _~ 3 hr, where the secondary has M2 ~ 0.3Mo. It was 
noted quite early on that this is about the mass at which lower-main-sequence 
stars lose their radiative cores and become fully convective. The idea that the 
period gap is somehow associated with this changeover is attractive, as it supplies 
a reason why the gap is "universal", i.e. occurs between essentially the same 
periods for almost all CVs. But we have no good theory of the orbital braking, 
let alone a reason why a fully convective secondary should sharply reduce it, 
and we have advanced little beyond plausible-sounding qualitative ideas. For 
example, within the magnetic braking picture one can argue that the lack of a 
radiative core robs the stellar dynamo process of a stable layer to anchor the 
footpoints of magnetic loops, which would then be strengthened by convective 
motions. But there is no compelling reason to assume this. Indeed Tout and 
Pringle (1992) for example make the opposite hypothesis, and assume that fully 
convective stars do undergo magnetic braking. Their derived angular momentum 
loss rate is high enough to drive mass transfer rates typical of systems above the 
gap, but predicts that systems below the period gap should have similar mass 
transfer rates also, contrary to observation. 
The period gap explanation detailed above, independently advanced by Rap- 
paport et al. (1983) and Spruit and Ritter (1983), thus has no firm theoretical 
foundation. However there is considerable circumstantial evidence supporting it. 
The position and width of the gap, as well as the Sharpness of its sides, are very 
well reproduced by calculations in which the extra orbital braking (64) is simply 
switched off once the secondary becomes fully convective. If we consider only the 
strongly magnetic AM Her systems among CVs, no less than 6 out of the current 
total of 17 lie in the extremely small period interval 113.6 < P < 115.6 min. 
This period "spike" has been explained by Hameury et al. (1988) as marking the 
resumption of mass transfer after passage through the period gap. Systems are 
much easier to find at this point because the fully convective secondary initially 
expands on mass loss and the orbital period increases slightly before decreasing. 
Not only are they somewhat brighter here, they spend longer near this period. 
Because the precise period at which mass transfer resumes is sensitive to the 
white dwarf mass, this explanation forces extremely tight constraints on the dis- 

188 
tribution of this quantity in AM Her systems (e.g Hameury et al. , 1989; Ritter 
and Kolb, 1992) which are nevertheless so far compatible with observation. Pre- 
sumably these constraints do not hold for non-magnetic CVs, which show no 
period spike. 
14. Short-Period 
LMXB 
Evolution 
As LMXBs differ from CVs only in substituting a neutron star or black hole for 
the white dwarf, it is reasonable to suppose that their orbital evolution might 
be similar: nothing in the preceding Section depends crucially on this difference. 
However, the LMXB period histogram does not support this view (Fig. 3): there 
are too few systems in the 80 min. - 2 hr range below the period gap, particularly 
as the two systems shown there have unconfirmed periods. This lack of systems 
is probably not caused by selection effects, as many of the LMXB periods were 
determined by EXOSAT, which had a 4 day orbit, and thus no reason to discrim- 
inate against short periods (unlike low Earth-orbit satellites whose periods are 
themselves close to 100 rain). The CV and LMXB distribution thus appear to be 
fundamentally different. The presence of a system with a well-confirmed period 
of 2.8 hr is unpromising for explanations involvingstronger orbital braking and 
thus a wider period gap in LMXBs. Some physical effect associated with the 
compact nature of the primary apparently makes LMXBs effectively disappear 
around 3 hr. Current attempts to explain this centre around the possibility that 
X-ray heating might bloat up the companion star by changing its internal struc- 
ture from convective to radiative (Podsiadlowski, 1991; Rappaport et aL 1991; 
Frank et al. , 1992) or that pulsar-type emission could evaporate the companion 
at short periods (van den Heuvel and van Paradijs, 1988).

Abstract: Pulsating radio sources, or pulsars, are rapidly rotating, highly mag- 
netized neutron stars. A pulsar emits beams of radio emission along its dipole 
magnetic field axes. The star's rotation sweeps one of the beams past the Earth 
to create the observed pulse if the axis is tilted with respect to the rotation axis. 
New classes of pulsars - including ones with millisecond rotation periods - have 
been discovered in the last decade. The rotations of pulsars are extremely stable. 
This stability allows pulsars to be used as probes of the interstellar plasma, for 
tests of General Relativity in the case of binary pulsars, and for detection of a 
cosmic background of gravitational radiation from the early universe. 
1 Pulsars 
1.1 A Brief History of Neutron Stars 
Pulsars are firmly associated with highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neu- 
tron stars. Neutron stars were first "invented" as a theoretical entity shortly 
after the discovery of the neutron. Calculations in the late 1930's indicated 
that a one solar mass neutron star would have a 10-kin radius and a cen- 
tral density around 1015 gm cm -3. Only theoretical progress was made on 
understanding the nature of neutron stars until the late 1960's. They were 
not expected to be observable owing to their small size. One of the most 
prescient remarks about neutron stars came in the year prior to the discov- 
ery of the first pulsar when Pacini (1967) suggested that a rapidly rotating, 
highly magnetized neutron star with a misaligned dipole moment would ra- 
diate sufficient magnetic dipole radiation to explain the energetics of the 
Crab Nebula. 
Pulsars were discovered accidentally during an investigation of extra- 
galactic sources by Hewish, Bell and colleagues (1967). Shortly thereafter 
other pulsating radio sources were found. The most important other object 
was the pulsar in the Crab Nebula because it provided the observational ev- 
idence for the direct link, proposed many decades earlier, between neutron 

194 
stars and supernovae. Pulsars in general are confined to "the galactic plane. 
The spatial distribution on the sky of 450 of the nearly 609 presently known 
pulsars shown in Fig. 1 does not overwhelmingly show a concentration in 
the galactic plane owing to the fact that the known objects are rather near 
the solar system. Pulsars are discussed in books by Manchester ~: Taylor 
(1977) and Michel (1991) and a review by Taylor & Stinebring (1986). 
Following the pulsar discovery galactic, point, Xray sources were found 
that were soon identified with binary systems in which mass is being trans- 
ferred onto the neutron star from the companion star. In these systems the 
source of energy is gravitational potential energy of the accretted matter. In 
pulsars the energy source is rotational kinetic energy. In the past decade or 
so a new class of pulsars - those with binary companions, and those associ- 
ated with globular clusters, have been discovered (Backer & Kulkarni, 1990). 
As the field has progressed over the past two decades the study of accretion 
powered Xray sources and rotation powered pulsars has merged to become 
comprehensive study of the death of stars (see review by Bhattacharya &= 
van den Heuvel 1991).

1.2. Standard Model of Pulsars 
Observations of pulsars have led to a number of highly developed theories 
about the structure and dynamics of pulsars. The extremely high matter 
density, the ultra strong magnetic field, and the rapid rotation of pulsars has 
pushed astrophysics into many extreme directions. I will discuss the main 
ideas about pulsars working from the inside out. The internal structure of 
a neutron star has a number of uncertainties owing to the extreme density 
of matter that is beyond the limits of laboratory measurements. Condensed 
matter physicists divide the neutron star into a core, which is a supercon- 
ducting, superfluid of 3P2 neutrons and 1S0 protons, an inner crust of 1S0 
neutrons, and an outer crust of heavy nuclei. The core contains 70% of the 
stellar radius and has 90% of the mass. The inner and outer crusts cover 
25% and 5% of the radius, respectively, and the inner crust contains the 
most of the remaining 10% of the mass. The values presented here are for 
a stiff equation of state that would give a 1.4 M® star a 16-km radius. 
In the rotating superfluid neutron star the rotation is carried by quan- 
tized vortices with a density of 6300/P cm -2 (P is the period in seconds). 
As the star slows down, which is the consequence of torques applied via the 
magnetic field to the outer crust, the density of vortices must fall. The vor- 
tices move outward and disappear. The inner crust is differentially rotating 
owing to the pinning of vortices to its lattice structure, a phenomenon seen 
in the laboratory in He 3. This leaves a piece of the star unconnected to the 
rotating body that we observe. In §4.6 I discuss instabilities in the smooth 
rotation and spin down of pulsars that are attributed to sudden or erratic 
events in the pinning and unpinning of vortices in the inner crust. For fur- 
ther information on neutron star interiors read the tutorial lectures by Sauls 
and by Alpar k Pines in the NATO ASI volume edited by Ogelman & van 
den Heuvel (1989) and the textbook by Shapiro &: Teukolsky (1983). 
Many observable phenomena in pulsars and in accreting Xray binaries 
lead us to conclude that neutron stars have intense magnetic fields that are 
dominated at large radii by a dipole component. Furthermore the dipole axis 
is required to be misaligned with the rotation axis. The lifetimes of pulsars 
require lifetimes for the currents that sustain the fields in excess of 106 years, 
and perhaps much longer. The crustal conductivity may or may not allow 
such stability. The properties of the pulsed radio emission lend the strongest 
support to the off-axis, dipole model. The radio emission is probably beamed 
along the dipole axis, and we observe a pulse as the star swings its beam 
past our line of sight (Fig. 2). Perhaps there are symmetric beams emanating 
from both poles that can be seen if the axes are orthogonal. 
All isolated pulsars have period derivatives that indicate the presence of 
a spindown torque. A few objects, which I will discuss in §5.1, display ap- 
parent spinups, but these are almost certainly the result of a small intrinsic 
spindown rate coupled with an acceleration in the gravitational potential 
of a globular cluster star system. A number of young pulsars, with ages 

196 
determined by their spindown rate, are surrounded by a nebula of energetic 
particles that one easily concludes are the result of energy emitted by the 
pulsar. The presence of a torque to spindown the pulsar, and the nebulae 
around other very young and rapidly slowing pulsars are consistent with 
Pacini's original idea that magnetic dipole radiation is responsible for both 
phenomena. If pulsars spindown in this manner, then we can estimate their 
energy loss rate with: 
/~ = If2~) = 4 x 10 ~1 erg s-lI45/5_15/P 3, 
(1) 
where/45 is the moment of inertia in units of 1045 g cm 2,/5_15 is the period 
derivative in units of 10 -15 s s -1, and f2 = 2:r/P. Magnetic dipole radiation 
leads to the relation/~ oc #2,.1_f24/c3 , where #d,.l. is the equatorial component 
of the magnetic dipole moment. An estimate of the surface magnetic field 
is then 
Bd,.L = 1012 G (P/5_15) 0'5, 
(2) 
for conventional neutron star parameters. The actual surface field strength 
can be significantly larger as a result of the aligned component of the dipole 
and higher multipole moments. 
Articles about the structure of the magnetosphere surrounding pulsars 
and the nature of the resultant torque make a clear case for the insuffi- 
ciency of the vaecuum dipole model (Goldreich and Julian 1969; Gunn and 
Ostriker 1969; Arons 1979; Michel 1991). Nevertheless the energy loss rate 
and magnetic field calculated above seem to give values that are supported 
by other observations: the power required to sustain the Crab Nebula and 
the surface magnetic fields inferred from cyclotron lines in the spectra of 
acereting Xray binaries. 
Goldreieh and Julian discuss the formation of a charge separated mag- 
netosphere driven by rotationally induced electric fields. A portion of this 
magnetosphere will corotate with the star as long as the field lines loop 
out to axial radii less than c/f2, the light cylinder radius (Fig. 2). The re- 
maining portion of the magnetosphere must reach out into the surrounding 
medium with field lines that sweep back to form a transverse, strong field 
wave far from the star. The sweep back requires a current that is driven 
by the rotation. This current can provide an additional braking torque on 
the star. While this description is certainly more complex than the vacuum 
dipole model, estimates of the resultant braking torque and magnetic field 
are comparable in magnitude and have similar scaling with neutron star pa- 
rameters. Some models conclude that the current related torque is largely 
independent of dipole inclination angle. There are no exact solutions for a 
charged, rotating magnetosphere that are relevant to the pulsar case (see 
Michel 1991, Arons 1992). 
The above discussion summarizes the main properties of a rotating, mag- 
netized neutron star. But how does it emit beamed radio signals? Good

Fig. 2. Pulsars are modeled as rotating neutron stars with an off-axis dipole 
magnetic field. The closed zone rotates with the star and extends to a cylindrical 
radius of c/D where corotation speeds approach c. An e+e - plasma is created by

altitudes in the pair plasma. (From Arons 1983.) 
question. The single idea that has held the attention of most investiga- 
tors is that the emission arises in the relativistic current along the dipole 
axis. The large and rapid sweep of linear polarization that is observed as 
the pulse swings by our line of sight led early investigators to this conclu- 
sion (Radhakrishnaa and Cooke, 1969). Nothing has swayed us from this in 
the intervening years. The qualitative idea is that the relativistic current is 
ducted along the intense magnetic field lines in the narrow zone of open field 
lines. Curvature of the field lines leads to an acceleration whose vector is in 

198 
the plane of curvature. Curvatures p between that of the stellar surface and 
that of the light cylinder, when coupled with the expected radio emission 
frequency 73c/p, suggest relativistic factors of 7 _ 102. The voltage drop 
along these polar field lines would allow much larger factors, and indeed 
other models for the formation of radio emission exist. 
The intensity of the radio emission, when coupled with the small size 
of the emitting region, which we determine either from this emission model 
or from the temporal fluctuations, indicate brightness temperatures of the 
emission as high as 103o K. The extreme thermodynamic condition of high 
brightness temperature and low energy (very low) photons require the col- 
lective motion of many charges - sometimes called coherent radiation. Many 
charges moving in unison lead to the coherent addition of emitted voltages 
rather than the usual addition of incoherent powers. In summary, we typi- 
cally view the radio emission as the result of turbulence convected relativis- 
tically along polar field lines, and carefully arranged to prevent any degrees 
of freedom for upconverting the copious number of low energy photons to a 
more balanced thermodynamic state. 
1.3. Origin and Evolution of Isolated Neutron Stars 
Once a class of objects is isolated in astronomical studies attention turns to 
understanding their origin and evolution. In a snapshot of the universe, one 
must make sense out of the different groups of related objects by connecting 
one class as the progenitors, for example, of another class. Sometimes there 
are even missing links. If a snapshot is taken of a steady process, then the 
number of objects in various evolutionary stages will be proportional to 
the lifetime of the objects in that stage. Students in school are a trivial 
example. Consider ~classes' as the groups. There are nearly equal numbers 
in each since the lifetime of all classes is the same, one 'year. Attrition of 
students from school will form an independent group and cause the class 
size to diminish with school year. On the other hand grouping according 
to primary school, junior high school, and high school, leads to relative 
lifetimes in the ratio of 6:2:4, for a typical US town. The relative numbers 
in each group will follow this ratio, apart from the attrition factor. 
One of the principal large goals of the study of neutron star evolution is 
connecting the pulsars we see with the entire population of neutron stars, 
with the supernova progenitors, and with the massive star population which 
is continually replenished by star formation in the interstellar medium. This 
is a tall order. The more restricted task of understanding the life cycle of 
the pulsar phase of the isolated neutron star is where some progress has 
been made. 
We are fortunate with pulsars in that their signals provide an evolution- 
ary clock in their period derivatives. The ratio of the period to the period 
derivative gives an age, an age for doubling the period. Furthermore we can 

199 
take the model presented above and create a more specific age after one 
or more assumptions are made. If the original period of the pulsar is Po, 
and if the braking mechanism evolves with constant perpendicular magnetic 
moment, then the true age of the star is 
tc = 
1- 
. 
(a) 
Isochrones based on (3) are drawn on the p/5 plot of pulsars in Fig. 3; 
the logarithm of the age in years of each isochrone is noted to the right of 
each. The typical age of pulsars by this means is a few million years. The 
boundaries of the isochrones delineate high and low magnetic field extremes. 
The standard model allows us to interpret the coefficient in terms of the 
magnetic moment, and with further assumptions, the dipole component 
of the surface magnetic field (2). Another age estimate comes from the 
location of the pulsar with respect to the galactic plane, which contains 
in a narrow layer the massive stellar progenitors. In many cases we even 
have the transverse motion of pulsars. Distance estimates required for these 
parameters are fortunately available from the column density of electrons 
that disperse pulsar signals (§2.4). 
What emerges from this abundance of parameters is that most pulsars 
are born in the layer that is associated with present day massive star for- 
mation. They live as pulsars for an interval of about 10 million years. Their 
"death" as radio emitting pulsars is the result of a combination of a slow 
decrease of luminosity combined with an abrupt turnoff (the e+e - limit in 
Fig. 3). During this time they travel away from the galactic plane to form 
a layer many times thicker than their progenitor stars. Also the torque on 
the pulsars seems to decay faster than expected based on the simple dipole 
spindown theory discussed earlier. This rapid decay has been attributed to a 
reduction of the dipole magnetic field by 1 or 2 orders of'magnitude over 10 
million years. This is shown in Fig. 3 by bends in the evolutionary paths of 
low and high field objects. These ideas are consistent with the observations, 
but there is a range of opinion at present. The data are not overwhelmingly 
in support of a single synthesis of ideas on the evolution of pulsars during 
their first 10 million years. 
On the origin side, the association of ten young pulsars with supernova 
remnants is conclusive about the birth of neutron stars in the cataclysmic 
event of the death of a massive star. We know that a supernova remnant 
indicates a massive star's final act by totaling the mass and the kinetic 
energy of the present day remains. Significant questions such as, "Are all 
neutron stars formed this way?", remain unanswered. Larger numbers of 
associations with supernova remnants and more proper motions may be 
available in the future. In the interim, large monte carlo simulations are 
being conducted to find a consistent model for the pulsar population origin 
and evolution.

2 Radio Astronomy Fundamentals 
In this section I provide a brief introduction to radio astronomy signals 
and pulsar signal processing. The fundamentals of radio astronomy and the 
properties of radiation can be explored further in the introductory radio 
astronomy and astrophysics texts by Kraus, Rohlfs, Rybicki & Lightman, 
and Shu. 
2.1 Radiation Properties 
We measure properties of the received electromagnetic radiation: the 2D in- 
tensity distribution, polarization, spectrum, and time variability. One then 
must face the inverse problem of constructing a model of the source emis- 
sion: the emission mechanism, the distribution of emitters and propagation 
of emission both within the source and along the intervening path, the 
dynamics of emitting and associated matter, and, finally, the origin and 
evolution of the system. I will focus here on the former - radio astronomical 
measurements - and forego much discussion of the latter - astrophysics. 
The radiation comes from an assemblage of many independent radiators 
- accelerated charges and charge bunches and quantum systems. As such 
we are interested in intensive quantities, and not in the electric field. These 
are presented below in a hierarchical manner associated with a chain of 
integrations over independent variables (beware, always, of exact meanings 
as associated jargon exists, at least in English). Order of magnitude values 
for two objects, the Sun and a typical pulsar, are given in columns 3 and 4.

Two further examples: the man on the moon imagery is a result of the 
variation of the surface brightness, or intensity (w~ch comes from the re- 
flected solar radiation); and the solar constant, 10 3 W m -2, is the solar flux 
integrated over frequency. 
An important property of intensity is that it does not change along the 
path of the radiation in the absence of absorbing material, and in Euclidean 

202 
spacetime. This is shown by an energy conservation argument. Pick two 
cross sectional areas transverse to the path. The energy transmitted from 
1 and passing through A2 is equal to the energy received through 2 and 
coming from AI: 
IldAldl21dudt = I2dA2d~2dudt. 
(4) 
But the solid angle dr21 = dA2/r 2, and, likewise, d~22 = dAx/r 2. Hence 
I1 = 12. This also contains a reciprocity relation: the conclusion can be 
reached for rays going either direction, so that problems of reception can be 
treated as problems of emission. 
An isolated box of particles at temperature T is bathed in isotropic 
electromagnetic radiation with an intensity spectrum given by the Planck 
Law: 
2hu 3 
1 
Idv = 
du. 
(5) 
c 2 
[exp(hu/kT)- 
1] 
No such perfect box exists, but some situations come close. The surface 
brightness of the Sun has a spectrum that approximates a Planck distribu- 
tion with T = 5850K. At long wavelengths the .leans approximation is used 
since hu << kT. 
2kTu2du 
2kT 
Ida- 
c2 
= --~-du 
(6) 
You can remember the factor of 2 as being associated with the 2 degrees of 
freedom of the photon spin. In this approximation you can see how surface 
brightness may be discussed as brightness temperature at radio wavelengths. 
The 2 photon spins lead to 4 polarization intensities, commonly de- 
scribed as Stokes parameters. These are the total intensity (I), two linear 
polarizations (Q and U), and a circular polarization (V). The total inten- 
sity would be measured by a pair of dipole antennae oriented at 90 degrees 
(X 2 + y2). Q is measured as the difference (X 2 -y2), while U is measured 
by a similar difference with the dipoles rotated by 45 degrees (X '2 - y,2). 
In this discussion, X and Y are the electric fields sampled by the dipoles. 
The right circular polarization could be measured by a helical antenna, or 
formed from the linears as R = X + jY; the left is L = X - jY. The V 
Stokes parameter (intensity) is then [RI 2 -ILl 2 = 2XY. 
Recall the qualification about constancy of intensity: "in the absence of 
absorption". There is no vacuum, only approximations to a vacuum. Matter 
absorbs electromagnetic radiation in an attempt to come into equilibrium, 
either giving off more than it absorbs or v.v. Of course it may also absorb 
the radiation that you are interested in and emit at a different wavelength. 
The simplest form of this is the one dimensional propagation of intensity 
through a uniform slab of absorbing matter. 
[out ~" [in exp(--T) + Istab[1 -- exp(--v)], 
or 
(7a) 

203 
T0., = 
exp(-T) + Ts,ob[1 - exp(-T)], 
(Tb) 
where 7- is the optical depth of the slab which is the product of an absorption 
coefficient and the physical thickness. Thermodynamics can be applied here: 
if Tin = T~tab, then Tout = Tin; i.e., everybody is at the same temperature. 
The topic of radiative transfer, both within the source of interest and 
along the way in the intergalactic, interstellar, solar system and earth's at- 
mosphere is extremely important in astronomy. Absorption is caused by the 
microphysics of the photon interaction with matter. There are other macro- 
scopic effects caused by these interactions: reflection, refraction, diffraction, 
and, in the presence of a magnetic field, birefringence. The latter three ef- 
fects are associated with thermal plasma interactions and are important in 
radio astronomy, particular with pulsars (§2.4, §3.0). 
2.2 Radio Telescopes 
The dipole antenna discussed above has an effective area for intercepting the 
electromagnetic flux density of A 2. A parabolic reflector is used in astronomy 
to focus the E field. The focused field is then sampled with a dipole, or its 
equivalent, to convert the free space field into a current driven through an 
amplifier. A Jansky of flux density produces one fW for a 104 m 2 collecting 
area and a bandwidth of 107 Hz. A tremendous amplification is required to 
bring this feeble signal up to the level of a mW which is a reasonable signal 
strength to manipulate. 
The radio telescopes in use are typically mounted in alt-az, or polar 
(ha-dec), configuration. Some of the largest antennas only allow transit ob- 
servations with mechanical, or electronic, steering in declination. The largest 
reflector is in Arecibo, PR, and is a spherical surface with an aberration- 
correcting waveguide "feed"; n.b., the "feed" feeds the signal to the dish, 
and via reciprocity, is equivalent to accepting signal from the dish. Some 
telescopes use a surface that deviates slightly from a parabola to improve 
their performance; e.g., the elements of the VLA. The new Green Bank Tele- 
scope will have a radical design which is an offset piece of a parabola that 
will eliminate any blockage of the incoming signal on its way to the "feed". 
Many high frequency telescopes have a secondary reflector near the primary 
focus to bring the signals to a focus near the vertex of the paraboloid; a 
hyperboloid for the Cassegraln design where the secondary is between the 
primary focus and the primary reflector, and an ellipsoid for the Gregorian 
design where the secondary is behind the primary focus. Typical f/D ratios 
are near 0.43 at prime focus, and near 10 at Cassegrain. 
The gain of a telescope is the ratio of the intensity at the focus to the 
incoming intensity. The efficiency of a telescope is the ratio of the effective 
area, which is what determines the intensity at the focus, to the geomet- 
ric area. Efficiencies are less than unity owing to such things as blockage, 

204 
which I just mentioned regarding the GBT, but more importantly owing to 
properties of the feed, which I come to next. 
First let's take a simple case and introduce the use of the Fourier trans- 
form. Also I will consider the case of transmission of electromagnetic waves. 
If I transmit from two locations, then in the far field these signals will inter- 
fere with successive maxima spaced in angle by .k/b± radians, where b± is 
the antenna spacing projected along the direction considered. The intensity 
pattern, which is the absolute square of this interference, also has "fringes" 
which on reception .would be called light and dark. This configuration is that 
of a Fourier pair: the E-field radiation distribution and the far-field interfer- 
ence pattern. We call the far-field pattern an angular spectrum. Spectrum 
implies Fourier transform, and it is the Fourier transform of the E-field radi- 
ation distribution converted via ,k/b± to angle. Let's move on. For a uniform 
field over a telescope diameter d, we would get a pattern that is sinc(Tr~d/)~) 
= sin(rcSd/)O/(rrOd/.k), and an intensity pattern of sinc(xTrSd/.k) 2. This in- 
tensity, or gain, pattern is the "beam" of the telescope. 
2.3 Radio Astronomy Receivers 
We have to convert the focused intensity into a current that will be amplified 
by, e.g., a transistor. This task is not obvious. First we have to "coax" the 
converging radiation down into a waveguide; i.e., we have to match the 
field patterns of the waveguide modes to those of the freely converging field 
just before the feed. Then we have to disturb the waveguide propagation 
by sticking a paper clip in there, a dipole antenna or its equivalent, in 
order to generate a voltage that will drive a current down a wire with 
its characteristic impedence (R). The power received at this point is the 
primary quantity that we need to calibrate. This power can be expressed 
in terms of the temperature of a resistor that would generate an equivalent 
power across its terminals (V2/R) via the thermodynamic oscillations of 
charges. And the voltage signal characteristics are just that - random. We 
call this temperature the antenna temperature. 
Typically a controlled source of electrical noise, which can be used as 
a secondary intensity standard at any time, is injected at this point. The 
signal then enters the first amplifier stage (see sketch in Fig. 4). Ill modern 
receivers from 400 MHz to 400 GHz the early stages of amplification, and 
often much of the waveguide, are cooled to 20 K, or below, to minimize 
losses. Losses, by the radiative transfer equation given above, show up as 
extra power; L = [1 -exp(--T)] is the loss factor, and Tslab is here Tamb, the 
ambient temperature. The typical radiometer equation is then: 
Ttotal -- (((Tsource + Tback + Tcal)(1 - L1) + TambL1)G1 + T2)G2... 
(8) 
where T~ource is that which we wish to measure, Tback is the excess noise 
entering the receiver (which includes the 2.7 K cosmic background, emission 

205 
from the galaxy and the earth's atmosphere, and scattered ground emission), 
T1 - L1T~D and G1 are the excess noise and gain of the first amplifier, 
and 
so on. 
Fig. 4. Radio astronomy receiver schematic 
The power that we measure, represented above as temperature, is pro- 
portional to the square of the voltage across a resistance, or load. This 
voltage is, in turn, proportional to the electric field incident on the antenna. 
The uncertainty in our measurement of power is ultimately limited by the 
statistics of the independent samples of the received electric field after de- 
tection, and averaging over both bandwidth (b) and integration time (~-, 
now a time interval and not opacity). The process is illustrated in Fig. 5. 
First we represent the narrow band voltage as a slowly varying (on time 
scale of 1/b) amplitude modulating a rapidly varying (on time scale of 1/w) 
sinusoid at the center frequency (w) 
vnb(t) = c(t) cos(wt) + s(t) sin(wt) 
(ga) 
Independent samples are spaced by the crossing time of the modulation 
1/2b. As a result power (temperature) fluctuations are given by 
T 
AT- ,/~. 
(9b) 
One must detect a signal by ON-OFF comparison against a background of 
the uncertainty AT which is proportional to the total system temperture, 
T. The source portion of T is proportional to the telescope gain, or effective 
area. Great care is taken then to minimize T while maximizing br. 
The narrow band representation is important for understanding the het- 
erodyne, or frequency conversion, process in radio astronomy systems. The 
signal is multiplied by a pure tone, or local oscillator, and filtered to shift 
the center frequency from the high radio frequencies of reception to lower 
frequencies more convenient for transmission and further amplification. The 
• translation starts with signals at Radio Frequencies and moves them first to

2.4 Propagation in the Interstellar Medium 
Pulsar signals traverse interstellar paths with column densities of 3 x 1021 
cm -2 and 1020 cm -2 for atomic hydrogen and thermal electrons over a 
kpc path, respectively. The paths are threaded by magnetic fields whose 
strength is a few #Gauss. The ionization that produces the electrons comes 
from the ultraviolet flux of hot stars, cosmic rays, and shocks generated 
by star formation and star death events. The magnetic fields are generated 
by large-scale currents of the interstellar plasma. The plasma is turbulent 
on scale lengths stretching all the way from 101° era, which diffracts and 
refracts radio signals, up to 1015 cm, which leads to secular variation of the 
propagation parameters, and beyond. 
2.4.1 Phase and Group Velocities 
The phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave is vp = ~ 
which becomes 
c in vacuo. The index of refraction for weakly ionized, unmagnetized plasma 
is

where vp = wp/2~r = 9 kHz x/ne(cm-a). The group velocity vg is deter- 
mined by the derivative of the dispersion relation which is derived from 
consideration of the propagation of a wave packet, or disturbance, that has 
finite bandwidth. 
aw 
vg _ ~-~ = en, 
(11) 
where the evaluation is given for the weakly ionized plasma. 

207 
If the medium has a variable index of refraction, then the radiation 
propagates along rays that bend (refract) according to 
d(nk) 
d---V- - w, 
(12) 
where n, k, and 1 are the index of refraction, the ray direction, and the 
ray path length, respectively. The gradient is defined over a transverse di- 
mension that exceeds the Fresnel zone scale, RF = X/x(1 - x)Ad, where d 
is the source-observer distance and x is the disance to the plane at which 
one is evaluating RF. You can see from this that the Fresnel zone defines a 
tube whose waist diameter grows to its largest dimension midway between 
the source and the observer. Gradients of the index of refraction across the 
tube make it snake its way along the path. There can be more than one 
refractive region that can send the signal to the observer. The gain of the 
refractive region is determined by the fraction of a Fresnel zone that is sta- 
tionary (constant) 15hase, but this jumps ahead of our story to topics of 
propagation. 
2.4.2 Dispersion 
The dilute plasma along the line of sight delays low radio frequencies relative 
to high radio frequencies. If this medium were fixed, then we could measure a 
dispersion constant once, and apply this to all data recorded at various radio 
frequencies. However, all of the media mentioned are fully turbulent with a 
broad spectrum of length scales. Precise pulsar timing requires continuous 
determination of the dispersive effects. 
The dispersive delay Atd is calculated from the path integral of the in- 
verse of the group velocity which is determined using the cold, unmagnetized 
plasma index of refraction, n. 
Atd= [E(! _ l)d 8 = 0.00415 s DM(pc cm -3) y(GHz) -2, 
(13) 
jp 
vg 
C 
where DM is the column density of electrons, or dispersion measure. The 
integral is taken from the pulsar at P to the Earth at E. A DM of 25 leads to 
an excess delay of 1 second for signals at meter wavelengths. The interstellar 
density is around 0.03 cm -3. A DM of 25 then indicates a distance of some 
750 pc. The dispersion within a narrow band of signals places a limit on the 
resolution that can be obtained: 
Td = 8.3 #s DM(pc cm -3) b(MHz) V-3(GHz) < (2b(MHz)) -1. 
(14) 
Measurement of dispersion requires timing of the pulse arrival at two 
or more radio frequencies. This is straightforward until one reaches the 
precision where one must deal with the fact that the pulse shape changes 
with radio frequency. Then some fiducial point will scale with the inverse 

208 
of the frequency squared, but other parts may disappear owing to spectral 
differences, or may be offset early or late. One approach to dealing with this 
complexity is to make a frequency dependent template of the pulse shape 
to compare with the data. 
Figure 6 displays the temporal variations of DM for two pulsars. The 
PSR 1937-t-21 data are particularly sensitive and display an event in the 
record in early 1992 - a brief increase in the DM that lasted 2-3 months. 
Structures such as this may occur when the line of sight crosses a thin sheet 
of ionized gas seen edge on. Larger amplitude structures like this have been 
inferred from observations of refractive focussing (Fiedler et aI. 1987) where 
the source, medium and observer are such as to bring a caustic past the 
observer in an interval of a few months.

2.5 Search Techniques 
2.5.1 Sampling 
Pulsar intensity signals are characterized by their period, duty cycle, and 
dispersion. The period and duty cycle lead to requirement of sampling the 
intensity at a rate many times the pulse period, 10-50. The Nyquist theorem 
says we gather all the information in bandwidth limited noise if we sample 
at twice the bandwidth rate. In an analog system the bandwidth is defined 
by the post-detection filter. One desires a rectangular passband gain, but 
this is often difficult to achieve. A simple RC circuit produces an exponential 
gain curve which if sampled at *t = RC/2 will cause a significant amount 
of aliasing of higher frequency signals. Let's take a closer look at this. The 
RC filter gain is G(f) = exp(-fRC). We sample at intervals of RC/2. 
The spectrum of this signal is formed via a Fourier transform of the real 
data samples into a complex spectrum. The amplitude falls as exp(-fRC) 
initially, and would continue to do so if we sample the signal much faster 
than RC/2. However at the end of our spectrum, the Nyquist frequency of 
fN = 1/RC, the higher frequency noise is aliased into the spectrum. Now 
noise "powers" add, so the amplitude will become, 
A(f) = v/exp(-fRC) 2 + exp(-(2RC - f))2. 
(15) 
In fact even further aliasing, from the next folds of the spectrum, take place, 
but the contribution is small. The additive nature of noise power leads us 
to use the amplitude squared, or fluctuation power. Filters with sharper 
cutoffs are desireable to prevent this aliasing which reduces the signal to 
noise ratio by a factor of 
R(f)- exp(-fRC) 
A(f) 
(16) 
On the other hand some well-known pulsar discoveries, 1937+21 in partic- 
ular, have made use of the extended range of frequency sensitivity that is 
possible with the aliased spectrum. 
Another common low pass filter is created by integrating the detected 
signal for a time ~t. Each sample is then independent and the effective low 
pass filter is given by the sinc function. This is seen by describing the process 
as a convolution by a top hat function of width ~t, and then sampling on 
the uniform grid spaced by ~t. The Fourier transform is then the product 
of the transforms of two first two convolved functions. The aliasing is now 
p(f) = sinc(~'fSt) 2 + sinc(~r(1 - fSt)) 2 + higher folds. 
(17) 
The data is taken over an interval T = NSt and the Fourier transform 
assumes the data is replicated on a grid of T. In the power spectrum domain 
the samples are spaced by T -1, the resolution, and the response varies 
as sinc2(TrSfT) in amplitude and the corresponding phase response ramps 
linearly with frequency by 7r between adjacent Fourier bins.

2.5.2 Standard Approach 
Most searches proceed by forming a set of 1D time series for a complete 
set of dispersions that can be formed from the output of a bank of narrow 
band filters. In recent Arecibo searches, this filter bank is effected by use 
of a digital correlator (e.g., Backer et al. 1990). Single dispersion data can 
be formed from the observations by summing along staircases of decreasing 
slope in the 2D frequency-time plane of data. In the case of digital cor- 
• relator sampling, a conversion to the frequency domain is effected by first 
symmetrizing the sampled correlation function, and then transforming. The 
effective filters thus have a sinc(2zrvr) gain response, where v is the radio 
frequency. The time series for a complete set of staircases can be formed 
by a fast folding algorithm first discussed by Staelin (1969) shortly after 
pulsars were discovered. This eliminates redundant sums just as the FFT 
algorithm eliminates redundant sum/products. 
The next step is to take the Fourier transform of the time series of length 
T that were formed for each independent DM channel, or staircase. This is 
effected with the efficient FFT algorithm which can be computed efficiently 
on modern vector processors. FFTs of lengths ranging from 32K to 32M are 
common. 
The Fourier transformation results in the narrow duty cycle, pulsed sig- 
nal being concentracted in a series of Fourier harmonics whose amplitudes 
are comparable out to a harmonic number given by the inverse of duty cylce, 
the ratio of the pulse width to the pulse period. These are delta functions 
with a sinc2(TrSfT) shape that results from the sampling window; the har- 
monics are of course not necessarily centered on the FFT frequencies. In 
addition, scintillation of the signals (§3.3) can cause a noticable broaden- 
ing of the responses. A harmonic summing algorithm is required to provide 
maximum sensitivity to the entire pulsed signal. One searches a range of 
possible harmonics required for every possible frequency. This allows for a 
range of possible duty cycles. 
Dewey et al. (1985) succinctly stated the minimum detectable flux den- 
sity of a pulsar search as 
10(Tsky -]- Tback) i

where the factor of 10 is the signal to noise ratio required for firm detec- 
tion amidst the many search parameters, Np is the number of polarizations 
summed (1 or 2), G is here the telescope gain in K/Jy, B is the total band- 
width, ~- is the integration time, w is the apparent pulse width from the 
combined effects of intrinsic width and dispersion and scattering, and P is 
the pulse period. 
There are many searches recently completed, or under way. These use 
the large telescopes at Arecibo, Parkes, and Jodrell Bank. Previous searches 
have mined the galactic plane for weaker and weaker pulsars with ever 

211 
shorter periods. The discovery by Wolszczan of two high latitude pulsars 
with short periods (during a period when the Arecibo telescope was oth- 
erwise idled by mechanical failure) has led to a flurry of all-sky searches. 
The next few years will see a continually growing list of these new pulsars. 
The searches are particularly exciting because the millisecond period pul- 
sars are a poorly understood distinct population, and the timing of these 
objects, as I will discuss, allows a variety of fundamental measurements to 
be performed. 
2.5.3 Other Aspects 
Hamilton et al. (1973) presented a novel two-dimensional approach to pul- 
sar searching. The radio frequency-time matrix of samples is transformed 
in both coordinates to delay-fluctuation frequency. A sequence of diagonal 
lines in the rf-t domain, which represent the dispersed pulsar signal, are 
transformed into a set of Fourier harmonics along a diagonal path in the 
d-ff domain. A two-dimensional search algorithm is then required. The Fast 
Pulsar Search Machine (FPSM) that we constructed at UCBerkeley is based 
on the Hamilton et al. algorithm (Backer et al. 1990). 
Current pulsar searches will have difficulty finding the shortest rotation 
period pulsars if they are in a very short orbital period binary system. The 
Doppler spread of the signal during the integration will reduce the amplitude 
of the harmonics as noted by Backer (1987) and as recently studied by 
Johnston K= Kulkarni (1991). Searches for pulsars in globular clusters now 
regularly explore 'acceleration space'. Anderson et al. (1990) reported the 
first pulsar that was found with their acceleration search algorithm, but not 
with their fixed Doppler algorithm. Middleditch has developed an algorithm 
that does a full Keplerian orbit search. He earlier developed an acceleration 
search that he applied to an investigation of extragalactic optical supernovae 
(Middleditch and Kristian 1984). 
2.6 Pulsar Timing Systems 
The simplest pulsar timing system is a power detector that is followed by 
a sampler and a signal averager which accumulates data into "phase bins" 
synchronous with the apparent pulse period. The structure within a pulse, 
its profile, requires sampling at intervals between 1/100 and 1/1000 of a 
period. The bandwidth must be limited to keep the dispersion smearing rd 
(14) below the sample time. More sensitivity can be obtained by defining 
many adjacent channels each with bandwidth b. There are several signal 
processing techniques that provide many adjacent channels. Local oscilla- 
tors and filters are used in the analog filter bank. Digital correlators were 
introduced for pulsar work, first in VLBI systems by Erickson et al. (1972), 
and later by our group at Berkeley for single dish work. Navarro and Kulka- 
rni at Caltech are currently completing the latest version of an correlator 

212 
based pulsar signal processor. In recent years a broad band FFT proces- 
sor has been developed and employed for pulsar signal processing at the 
NRAO in Green Bank, WV, by Fisher and LaCasse. All of these systems 
create a two dimensional array of intensity measurements. The signals from 
individual channels can be summed after removal of the relative dispersion. 
In all cases the summing must be synchronous with the pulse period 
that is constantly changing owing to the Doppler motion of the Earth, and, 
in the case of pulsars with companions, the motion of the neutron star 
itself. Two techniques are commonly employed. Either the time base of the 
sampler and signal processor is changed to maintain synchronism with the 
apparent period, or the time base is held constant, and the phase of each 
sample calculated to allow storing in the correct "phase bin". In the latter 
case, the number of entries in each bin must also be maintained. When the 
sampling is driven by the channel bandwidth, an odd number of phase bins 
per period is required to match the pulse period. 
The detection techniques discussed above have a severe limitation in the 
case of very short period pulsars with modest DMs and for observations at 
meter and decimeter wavelengths. The equation above produces a limiting 
bandwidth, and therefore time resolution, when the dispersion smearing Td 
equMs the sample interval (2b)-1. If further resolution is required one must 
remove the dispersion in the voltage, or electric field, prior to detection. 
This is called coherent disperion removal in contrast to the post detection 
removal, or incoherent technique. 
Several approaches have been taken to this. The very first work by Han- 
kins (1971) used voltage data sampled on magnetic tape. The dispersion 
was removed in a computer, and then the signal was detected and pro- 
cessed further. The scientific goals of this computer intensive process were 
not pulsar timing. A surface acoustic wave technique was developed, but 
did not see intensive use. Hankins later developed with Stinebring and col- 
leagues a hybrid analog/digital convolution device based on a Reticon de- 
vice designed for chirp-z transforms (Stinebring et aI. 1992). Biraud and 
colleagues at Meudon developed a swept oscillator approach to coherent 
dispersion removal. This clever scheme, which was first used by Staelin to 
look at the Crab pulsar, turns time, or pulse phase, into frequency so that an 
ordinary digital correlation spectrometer can be used for a signal averager. 
Coherent dispersion removal from within a narrow signal band can be most 
clearly stated in terms of the phase function with which one must multiply 
the spectrum to remove the dispersion. The convolution technique already 
mentioned employs the Fourier transform theorem that a multiplication in 
frequency is equivalent to a convolution in time. Ables at CSIRO has devel- 
oped an FFT-based coherent dispersion removal pulsar timing processor.

3 Further Topics on Radio Wave Propagation 
3.1 Absorption 
In pulsar timing we are not too interested in the absorption of pulsar radia- 
tion in the column of neutral hydrogen atoms along the path. We do use this 
absorption along with a model of the galactic rotation to infer distances of 
the pulsars (see Frail &: Weisberg 1990). For some of the nearest millisecond 
pulsars we can determine a trignometric parallax (§4.7), but for these there 
is typically no hydrogen absorption for comparison. 
3.2 Birefringence 
The group delay for two circularly polarized modes differs if the integral of 
the product of the parallel magnetic field B± with the electron density is 
nonzero. This difference is typically seven orders of magnitude less than the 
dispersive delay, and is therefore neglected in arrival time measurements. 
The phase delay difference does produce observable effects for linearly po- 
larized signals. A linearly polarized signal can be decomposed into opposing 
circular modes whose relative electrical phase determines the PA of the lin- 
ear. The PA will rotate with frequency by an angle X equal to the phase 
delay between the modes ~0(to - tx). This rotation is called Faraday ro- 
tation. The Faraday rotation angle is derived from a path integral of the 
difference between the inverses of the phase velocities for the two circular 
modes, c/no,x.

The parameter RM is the Rotation Measure, and ranges from 0.1 to 1000 
rad m -2 for most objects in the galaxy. 
The ratio of the rotation and dispersion measures gives an estimate of 
the galactic magnetic field strength (component parallel to signal path, and 
averaged along the path with weighting by the electron density): 
< B± >= 1.232 pGauss RM(rad m -2) 
DM(cm_3pc). 
(20) 
These magnetic field estimates along with pulsar distance estimates are used 
to create a galactic model of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the solar 
system (Rand & Kulkarni 1989; Clegg et al. 1992). 

214 
3.3 Scattering 
Turbulence in the interstellar plasma is driven by injection of energy into a 
gas on a characteristic length scale, and the spread of turbulent cells to other 
scales through viscous interaction and dissipation. Turbulence in the ionized 
interstellar medium means that the radio emission wavefront is crinkled in 
proportion to the path integral of the corresponding index of refraction fluc- 
tuations along the unperturbed signal paths. If the phase of the wavefront 
is perturbed by more than a radian within a Fresnel zone, then diffraction 
develops. That is, across a plane perpendicular to the path at the location 
of the observer there will be bright intensity maxima and minima where the 
signal goes to zero. The Fresnel zone size for a kpc path (3x1021 cm) at 
decimeter wavelengths (30 cm) is 3x1011 cm, 4 solar radii for comparison. 
The instantaneous diffraction pattern will be very frequency dependent if 
there are many random turns of phase within the Fresnel zone owing to 
the quadratic dependence of the index of refraction on frequency. Typical 
transverse scales for a radian of phase change are around 109 cm. Eventu- 
ally, at some high frequency, the phase perturbation within the Fresnel zone 
will drop below a radian and the diffractive effects will subside. Topics deal- 
ing with interstellar scattering are discussed in recent conferences edited by 
Cordes, Rickett & Backer (1988) and Baldwin and Wang (1991). 
The Earth observer, the pulsar, and even the medium are all moving with 
respect to each other. This produces a time variable diffraction pattern. The 
signal intensity goes up and down with wide swings of intensity when the 
bandwidth is small enough. Astronomers refer to this as scintillation. At 
meter wavelengths and for DMs around 25 the bandwidth of scintillation is 
a fraction of 1 MHz and the scintillation time scale is minutes. Larger radio 
sources, quasars and radio galaxies, show no such effects owing to their 
size which blurs the diffraction pattern - stars twinkle and planets do not 
in the Earth's atmosphere. In summary the scattering observables are: the 
time scale for scintillation; the frequency scale for "spectrM scintillation"; 
the radio frequency scaling law of these two parameters; and the size scale 
of the diffraction pattern (when it is smaller than the Earth so that one 
can observe it), From these parameters one can assess the strength of the 
turbulence along a given path, and the transverse velocity of the diffraction 
pattern. 
Diffraction requires ray paths that, while formerly diverging from the 
source, converge on the observer. The path lengths of the various rays that 
reach the observer differ. Thus, an impulse spit out by the pulsar will now 
be spread out by a geometric factor, 
d82 
(21) 
"rb ~" 2c ' 
where d is the distance to the turbulent "screen", and 8~ is the "scattering" 
angle. Let me make a semantic point here. The microphysical phenomenon 

215 
that does the damage to the wavefront is scattering of the electrical field 
by electron interactions. So the phenomenon is called interstellar scattering, 
and not interstellar scintillation which is just one of the effects of interstellar 
scattering. Equation 21 is for a source at infinity. An excellent exercise is 
to develop the scale factor for a source at a finite distance with the phase 
perturbing screen at an arbitrary fraction of the source-observer distance; 
simple point to point ray path geometry will do. Note that I have repeatedly 
referred to a collapse of the phase perturbing medium into a single screen. 
This thin-screen approximation is crucial to a simple analysis of the effects, a 
Born approximation approach. The scintillation bandwidth is the conjugate 
parameter to this broadening time since it is the differential delays between 
paths that cause the constructive and destructive interference as a function 
of frequency. 
Now one might ask if there isn't also turbulence on scales larger than 
the Fresnel zone? Yes, and this produces refraction and the DM variations 
shown in Fig. 6. The source position is shifted by gradients of phase, and 
quadratic phase terms lead to amplification or diminuation of the intensity. 
Even more severe perturbations can lead to caustics, and double images 
which interfere coherently just like an interferometer. These are fascinating 
areas of current research. 
3.4 Solar Wind and Ionosphere 
Pulsar signals also traverse the solar wind flowing out from the Sun and the 
ionosphere that surrounds the Earth. At a radio frequency of 1 GHz typical 
delays are around 0.1 microsecond for both of these media with the solar 
elongation of 90 ° . These plasma delays also scale with the inverse square 
of the radio frequency. Both media are highly variable on a day to day 
and season to season basis. The solar wind delay is very dependent on the 
solar elongation owing to the sharp gradient in the density of the outflowing 
plasma (Krisher et al. 1991). The Earth's troposphere adds a rather small 
additional nondispersive delay 
3.5 Relativistic Delay in Solar System Potential 
Pulsar signals axe delayed relative to those in a vacuum by the curvature 
of space that is synonomous with the presence of massive bodies. Photons 
from the pulsar follow null trajectories of the geometry. To first order, the 
line element is 
da 2 = (1 - 2U)c2dt 2 - (1 + 27U)(dx 2 + dy 2 + dz 2) = 0. 
(22) 
where U is the gravitational potential from all solar system bodies, and ~/ 
is one parameter in the Paxametrized Post-Newtonian coordinate system of 

216 
Will &= Nordvedt (1972). An expression for the time of flight extra delay 
owing to this effect is then 
Grnp 
Ifi.r,+rpl 
(23) 
nts=(l+~)~p-v--ln 
7,:R+R 
' 
where rp is the position of the observatory relative to the pth solar system 
body, and R is the pulsar's position relative to the body p. This delay, which 
was first pointed out by Shapiro (1964), is the longitudinal counterpart of 
the more familiar transverse effect that was identified by Einstein as one 
of his three tests of General Relativity, the bending of light by the Sun. 
The factor 2Gm/c 2 is the gravitational radius of an object, and is about 3 
km for the Sun. The corresponding delay is then 10 microseconds times the 
logarithmic factor. This delay is 135 microseconds at the limb of the Sun 
for a distant pulsar, and is very difficult to measure in the presence of very 
large and variable plasma delays. The most precise measurements of 7 come 
from dual frequency radio interferometry. The best current measurement is 
= 1.0002 ± 0.0020 by Robertson &= Carter (1991). There will also be large 
contributions to the relativistic delay as the signal traverses the interstellar 
gravitational potential. However, these are so nearly constant that their 
effect on pulsar timing will not be measureable. This is particularly true 
when one considers the stellar parameter estimation process that is the 
subject of the next section. 
4 Pulsar Timing 
The standard model of pulsars presented above in §1.2 has one or more 
beams of radiation continuously emitted in a radial direction. The space- 
time locus of this radiation is a spiral winding away from the neutron star 
like the stream of water from a lawn sprinkler. Pulses are detected at the 
observatory as radiation from successive stellar rotations cross the observer's 
path. The observer records the time of these crossing events as registered on 
a comoving clock. More precise definitions are given below. The first stage of 
pulsar timing analysis is a transformation of the space-time reception event 
of the pulse front crossing the observatory to the corresponding transmission 
event of the launching of this pulse at the neutron star. The transmission 
event is fictitious and covers our ignorance of the emission process. I will 
not deal with issues of aberration and retardation of the radiators and the 
radiation in a pulsar magnetosphere. I am also not interested in the exact 
orientation of the neutron star, but only its relative orientation between 
successsive rotations. The second stage of pulsar timing is an analysis of 
events in the reference frame of the neutron star: do the transmission events 
observed follow a simple model for the rotation that involves an initial epoch, 
period, and period derivative to within the noise of the measurement (and 

217 
precision of the transformation)? Precise pulsar timing has been discussed 
recently by Backer & Hellings (1986), Hellings (1986), Backer (1989), Taylor 
(1989) and Doroshenko &= Kopejkin (1990). References for timing binary 
pulsars will be given in §5. 
4.1 Arrival Time Measurement 
In the ideal case one time tags the arrival of individual pulses. In practice 
individual pulses vary considerably within a well-defined window of rota- 
tiona ! longitude, and may be too weak to detect individually. Pulsar timing 
then requires averaging over many pulses, often thousands~, to obtain a sta- 
ble emission pattern, or profile of flux density, with sufficient signal to noise 
ratio, 8nr, for pulse detection. One of the remarkable features of the pulsar 
phenomenon is that stable profiles are obtained in spite of the dramatic pulse 
to pulse fluctuations. Helfand et al. (1975) present a quantitative study of 
the stabilization of profiles as a function of integration time. Similar stud- 
ies are needed for a wider set of objects to validate this assumed property. 
Experimentally the samples of flux density are often taken with a'time base 
that is synchronous with the apparent pulse period as estimated from an 
existing model. This "allows the summing of successive blocks of 1024 sam- 
ples, which is a typical number per period, into an averaging array. The 
space-time event recorded is the time of the first sample of the first block. 
All successive samples are taken at deterministic times relative to the first 
sample. Examples of several pulse profile integrations are shown in Fig. 7. 
The sensitivity of radio astronomical observations - the ability to detect 
signal power against a background of unwanted noise coming from the am- 
plifier and other unavoidable processes - is determined by the inverse of the 
square root of the product of the bandwidth and the integration time. In 
the present example the snr for each sample of the profile is proportional to 
v/bNP/1024, where N is the number of pulses averaged. Dispersion limits 
b, but we can increase our sensitivity by using many adjacent channels of 
width b. Signal processors that define many chalmels and then detect and 
average the results, are a continuing engineering challenge. 
Pulsar signals are highly polarized. Most timing observations accumu- 
late averages of orthogonally polarized signals. These are calibrated to a 
common flux density scale and added together to form the total intensity 
profile. Careful calibration is required to prevent distortion of the profile 
from polarization effects. 
The next step in pulsar timing is the comparison of a pulse average 
with a template pulse. The template pulse typically comes from a long 
term average of the data itself. Alternatively an analytic model can be 
derived from the data and then used as a template. See example in Figure 
7. The observed pulse is convolved with the template pulse to obtain the 
relative pulse arrival time from the peak of the correlation function. Other

Fig. 7. Pulsar timing data profiles. The first five plots contain successive 2-min 
integrations of PSR 1937+21 at the NRAO 140ft telescope using 20 MHz of band- 
width at 1320 MHz; scale is flux density (Jy) vs bin number (1-121). In the lower 
right is a standard template which is convolved with the data to obtain relative 
arrival times. 
approaches such as use of Fourier techniques have Mso been developed. The 
relative pulse arrival time is added to the first sample start time to obtmn 
the observatory, or topocentric, time of arrival or TOA. The precision of 
determination of a TOA will depend on the source average flux density, 
the width of the pulse, and the instrumental factor discussed above. Short 
period pulsars can be timed more precisely than longer period objects with 
equal flux density owing to the narrower pulse width in the shorter period 
pulsars. 
In standard practice the constant time interval in the template from its 
first sample to a selected fiducial point of the pulse, such as the peak, is 
added to the TOA. Also, the time intervM in a many period integration 
from the first sample of the first pulse down to the first sample of a pulse 
in the middle of the integration is added to the TOA. This mid-integration 
correction reduces the sensitivity of the TOA to systematic drifts that will 
occur if there is an error in the assumed model. An additional correction of 
the TOA for propagation from the sampling hardware back to the fidueial 
point that corresponds to the observatory coordinates in the Earth reference 
frame should be done, but is not done in present work. This latter effect is 
essential only if absolute TOAs are compared between observatories. 

219 
4.2 Time Correction 
Anyone who has some familiarity with astronomical observations knows that 
there are many, too many, time scales - sidereal time, universal time, atomic 
time, Julian Date, Gregorian Date, et al. See .]esperson ~ Hanson (1991) 
for a general discussion of time and frequency issues. We need to record 
our space-time pulse arrival event on a uniformly running time scale in the 
observer's reference frame. This time scale, generically, is atomic time. The 
standard atomic time scale, International Atomic Time - TAI, is based on 
an assumed value for the frequency of a transition in the Cesium atom, and 
a particular, but arbitrary epoch for the origin of the scale. The principal 
calendar scale is Julian Date which increments the day number after 24 
hours of TAI and has no year; the day boundary is at noon. 1991 August 
20 noon (in Graz) corresponds to JD 2448489.00. 
Observatory clocks keep universal time, a 24-hour scale that is also 
known as Greenwich Mean Time. Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, is 
the most accurate universal time scale which is coordinated by Bureau In- 
ternational des Poids et Mesures in Paris (BIPM). UTC is deciminated by 
various means so that the observatories can keep approximate UTC. The 
UTC scale now runs at a rate identical to that of TAI. However, the goal 
of UTC is to assist in predicting the meridian transit of the Sun at any 
observatory. This means that it is a solar, or Earth rotation, time scale, and 
must be locked to the somewhat erratic rotation of the Earth. There is an 
offset in phase, or epoch, between UTC and TAI. This offset is adjusted by 
leap seconds that are inserted at midnight on December 31, or more often if 
needed. Observations of the orientation of the Earth are required to deter- 
mine when leap seconds are needed. As an aside, the Earth's rotation was 
the basis of civilization's time scale for centuries. After electronic crystal 
clocks were developed in the 1930's the erratic behavior of the Earth's rota- 
tion was observed, and laboratory clocks took over the job of precise time 
keeping. Sidereal time gives the orientation of the Earth with respect to the 
stars, and is derived from UTC by a step in epoch called (UT1-UTC), and 
then a change in rate that reflects rotation with respect to the stars rather 
than the sun. 
There are several means of transfering the epoch of a time scale from a 
standards laboratory to a remote astronomical observatory. The crudest is 
the long wavelength radio signals of WWV at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 MHz that 
are broadcast from Fort Collins, CO, and travel large distances around the 
globe by reflection off the ionosphere. Similar signals are broadcast by the 
time services of various nations. The accuracy is around 1 ms for distances 
of a few thousand kilometers. The US maintains a system of 100-kHz trans- 
mitters for radio navigation called Loran C. These signals travel as a ground 
wave and provide microsecond level time transfer for distances up to 1500 
km. The most accurate time transfer is now done using the Global Posi- 
tioning System of satellites. Signals are transmitted in bands between 1300 

220 
and 1700 MHz. The Cesium atomic clocks on board on these satellites are 
monitored from the ground, and a prediction ephemeris is sent back to them 
to allow reM time transfer at the level of 100 ns. Even better transfer can be 
obtained by reaLtime tracking of the same satellites at the observatory and 
at a national standards laboratory - the common view technique. A trans- 
fer accuracy of a few ns has been obtained in an experiment where time 
was transferred between laboratories and satellites in three hops around the 
globe (Ashby &: Allan 1984). Careful applications of relativity theory are 
required to conduc.t this experiment in the rotating, non-inertial reference 
frame of the laboratories. 
The time transfer discussed above makes the best atomic time scale 
available to the remote observatory. This time scale currently is called Ter- 
restrial Dynamical Time, TDT. TDT is computed at the BIPM by averaging 
over the International Atomic Time scales, TAI(x), as realized at various 
standards laboratories identified by x. TDT is proper time for an observer 
at sea level on the Earth, and is not a uniform time scale in the reference 
frame of the pulsar. In the pulsar frame the Earth clock is affected by the 
variable gravitational redshift that is the result of the influence of the Sun 
and the planetary masses in the solar system, and by the variable time di- 
lation along the more or less elliptical orbit of the Earth. The ratio of the 
rate of a TDT clock (ti) to the rate of a clock in the solar system barycenter 
(r) in the absence of any solar system bodies is given by 
dti

where rnp is the mass of solar system body p, rip is the distance from the 
clock to the body, and vi is the velocity of the clock. These two effects, which 
are the result of the equivalence principle and special relativity, respectively, 
are inseparable in their time signature. The principle periodic term in the 
difference between the two clocks can be approximated by an analysis of a 
clock in a pure elliptical orbit around the Sun,

where e is the eccentricity and M is the mean anomaly (roughly phase 
within year) of the Earth's orbit (Clemence & Szebehely 1967; Blandford & 
Teukolsky 1976). 
If one conducts pulsar timing observations with submicrosecond preci- 
sion, then this relativistic dock correetion must be done much better than 
is possible by simple analytic expressions. Several groups who develop de- 
tailed models of the solar system dynamics have provided algorithms and 
ephemerides that have sufficient precision. The barycentric time scale ~- 
is not what is obtained by these means. By international agreement the 

221 
corrected time scale is declared to have only the periodic terms in dt/dr 
removed. This modified scale is called Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB. 
In summary UTC(observatory) is converted to .UTC(standards labora- 
tory) by a satellite time transfer technique, and then to UTC(BIPM) ac- 
cording to an algorithm. UTC(BIPM) is, apart from a constant that is in- 
cremented slowly by integer seconds, atomic time TAI(BIPM). TAI(BIPM) 
is converted to proper time on the geoid TDT by a second algorithm, and 
then to coordinate time for solar system dynamics TDB through use of a 
relativistic clock transformation ephemeris. 
4.3 Space Correction 
The space correction relocates the arrival time from the observatory to the 
origin of a local inertial reference frame, the solar system barycenter. The 
Earth moves in a nearly circular orbit of radius 1.5 x 1013 cm, or 500 light 
seconds. The accuracy of the transfer of arrival that is required for the 
highest precision pulsar timing is 0.1 #s which is 2 x 10 -l° smaller than the 
orbit size. 
The space correction is typically effected in two steps (Fig. 8). First 
the arrival time is transferred from the observatory to the Earth center 
using a simple model for the Earth's orientation in an inertial frame and 
the star's celestial coordinates. This step is similar to the calculations that 
are required to perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at radio 
wavelengths, although the accuracy requirements for VLBI are much more 
stringent. 
The transformation from the Earth center to the solar system barycenter 
requires an accurate ephemeris, or prediction table, of the Earth's position 
as a function of date. There are two principal groups involved in solar system 
dynamics research and ephemeris production. They assemble all measure- 
ments of solar system bodies - optical eclipses and occultations, radar range 
measurements, planetary probe results - and feed this data into a compre- 
hensive model fitting program. Masses and orbital elements are adjusted to 
obtain the best fit to the data. The resulting model of the solar system can 
then be extrapolated into the future for uses such as spacecraft tracking, 
observations of planets and other bodies, and pulsar timing. The ephemeris 
computer file typically consists of values evaluated every four days. Inter- 
mediate results are obtained by interpolation.

and Hellings 1986). 
4.4 Pulsar Parameter Estimation 
In the above sections I have stepped through the various terms that are 
removed in making the space-time transformation from the observer's refer- 
ence frame to that of the neutron star. This provides a set of times of emis- 
sion of pulses that can be matched to a model of the rotation of the star. 
The process, however, is not as linear as just implied. The celestial coordi- 
nates of the pulsar are required to remove the effects of the Earth's motion, 
and these, at the required level of precision, must be derived from the data. 

223 
The DM must also be derived from the data, and the multi-frequency ob- 
servations that allow a DM determination may not be simultaneous. What 
must be done is to iterate from starting parameters that allow connection 
of data without rotation number ambiguities over limited intervals of time, 
and then work toward model parameters that are without ambiguity over 
longer intervals. 
The rotation of the star, if it acts as a simple clock, can be described by 
a polynomial in pulse number, 
= to + N Po + N 
Po Po/2 + ..., 
(13) 
where to, P0, and 150 are the initial epoch, period and period derivative, and 
tN is the epoch of the Nth pulse; epoch and arrival time are synonymous. 
Higher derivatives may. also be present. However, if the star's spindown, 
which is described by P0, is the result of magnetic dipole radiation, then 
the next derivative can be estimated as 
PM = --F 
(14) 
In most stars this higher derivative produces unmeasureable effects. The ro- 
tation parameters are the strongest effects since they arise on the shortest 
time scales. After obtaining parameters that are suitable first for hours then 
for days, one can begin to include the astrometric parameters that have a 
time scale of one year. Observations of binary pulsars are further compli- 
cated by the required estimation of Keplerian parameters of the binary orbit 
as well (§5.2). 
Figure 9 illustrates some of the steps that I have just discussed. In all 
cases the data displayed are timing residuals R - the difference between 
observations and a preliminary model. Note that in all cases the residuals 
are much less than the star's rotation period. This is extremely important 
since all we know is pulse phase, modulo one period. If the residuals are 
not small with respect to one period, then the model will have the pulse 
number, N, in error, and the residuals will not provide-the correct data 
for new parameter estimation. At first data with imperfect estimates of the 
spin parameters are shown. Next data that extends beyond the region of 
a previous fit are shown. This illustrates the poor extrapolation capability 
of a fit over a restricted range; this is expected and is no methodological 
shortcoming. Finally data for an entire year are displayed that has a small 
position error, and for several years that shows the effects of proper motion.

4.5 Rotation 
Noise 
When proper account is taken of all the effects mentioned above, then one 
might expect the residuals to display the character of white noise which 
would result from uncorrelated errors. However, in many stars, particularly 
those younger than 10 5 y, the residuals are distinctly not white. Terms like 
"white" are used to indicate a frequency indendent spectrum of fluctuation, 
and "red" to indicate a spectrum where the low frequencies (i. e., red) have 
larger amplitude variations then those at high frequencies. Qualitatively, a 

225 
red spectrum of variations will appear as a slow meandering of arrival time, 
or phase, with an amplitude of a fraction of the pulsar period, 1-10%, and 
occasional sudden events, called glitches. 
The glitches are most dramatic. In a matter of seconds to minutes the 
pulse period may jump by parts per million. The period event is accompa- 
nied by a similarly sudden increase in the spindown rate. The net effect of 
the subsequent evolution is that the excess spin is nearly removed over an 
interval of weeks to months, and the spindown rate returns to its preglitch 
magnitude. There is an extensive literature built up around these glitches 
that discusses the evolution of the internal structure of neutron stars from a 
condensed matter viewpoint. Briefly, the standard model here is that a thin, 
inner crust is normally decoupled from the rotation we observe. This inner 
crust is differential rotating with a specific angular momentum in excess of 
that in the rest of the star. Some catastrophe occurs that leads to an abrupt 
coupling of this inner crust to the rest of the star. Its extra momentum leads 
to the spinup. However, the star now carries an extra moment of inertia, and 
will spindown more rapidly. Eventually the inner crust will decouple again. 
The mechanism of coupling and decoupling has to do with the dynamics 
of the quantized rotation vortices which carry the angular momentum in 
neutron star interiors and the lattice structure of the crust (e.g., see Sauls 
1989). 
The random noise behavior in pulsar timing residuals is also connected to 
the evolution of the neutron star figure. The neutron star crust has sufficient 
strength so that the crust can carry the equilibium figure of the star in a 
prior state of rotation - in other words, the equatorial bulge of the crust 
will be larger than one would calculate for an equilibrium, self-gravitating 
fluid. Eventually gravitational and centrifugal forces will need to balance at 
the appropriate radius. The transition from the old figure to the new may 
be marked by a glitch, or by slow meandering. 
Investigators have quantified the degree of "red" rotation noise by a loga- 
rithmic activity index which is the variance of the timing residuals measured 
at a selected time interval relative to the variance in the somewhat noisy 
Crab pulsar. A background level of white noise, which is assumed to result 
from instrument sensitivity and not the pulsar, is removed. Activity indices 
vary from +1 for a few pulsars with variances ten times larger than the 
Crab's, down to upper limits of -4 for some some of the millisecond pulsars. 
The millisecond pulsars thus have the exciting combination of both short 
periods, which means short pulse widths and therefore high timing precision 
capability, and low activity which means they are very stable clocks. 

226 
4.6 Astrometry 
In §4.3 the correction from the observatory arrival time to the arrival time 
at the solar system barycenter was described. This requires knowledge of the 
celestial coordinates of the pulsar in the reference frame of the ephemeris. 
Microsecond timing precision requires angular precision corresponding to 
the ratio of a microsecond to the light travel time for 1 AU, or 2 nanoradi- 
ans which is 0.0004". At this level of precision the orientation of the reference 
frame of the epheraerides, which is based on ecliptic coordinates, and that 
of the extragalactic sky, which is based on VLBI observations and there- 
fore is associated with the orientation of the Earth, is uncertain. Pulsar 
observations are playing a role in the tying together of these two reference 
frames. 
A pulsar at 1 kpc moving with a transverse velocity of 1 km s -1 travels 
one nanoradian in one year. Pulsar velocities are much larger. This means 
that proper motion measurements are readily made by analysis of pulsar 
timing data. Unfortunately there is no way that we can measure the radial 
velocity component. The irregularities found in some pulsar timing data 
wreak havoc with these measurements, and have limited the determination 
of proper motions to the quieter pulsars. Fomalont et al. (1992) have made 
a detailed comparison between proper motions determined by timing and 
by radio interferometry. 
The timing precision obtained with millisecond pulsars is so good that 
determination of a trigonometric parallax is possible. The pulses from a 
source at finite distance pass through the solar system along curved fronts, 
while those at infinite distance arrive on flat fronts. The curvature can be 
detected as early arrival times twice per year. Ryba ~= Taylor (1991) present 
a parallax of 1.2 mas for PSR 
1855+09. 
5 Binary, Millisecond and Globular Cluster Pulsars 
5.1 Origin and Evolution 
Most stars one sees in the night sky are members of a binary system. If 
supernova events do not unbind binary systems, then a significant fraction 
of neutron stars will also be members of binary systems. The Xray binaries 
provide firm evidence that at least the first supernova event in a binary, 
i.e., the first neutron star production event, does not always unbind binaries. 
Hulse and Taylor (1974) discovered the first binary pulsar, PSR 1913+16. In 
§5.2 I will show that pulse arrival time measurements of a binary pulsar give 
us the mass function that allows an estimate of the binary companion mass 
if one assumes the pulsar mass is 1.4 M®. For PSR 1913+16 and a few others 
the companion mass is a similar 1.4 M®. These are the high mass binary 
pulsars which have progenitors first in the high mass Xray binaries, and 
earlier in high mass OB binary star systems. They evidently have survived 

227 
two violent neutron star formation events. However their numbers are small, 
and the conclusion is that survival is improbable. The spindown lifetimes of 
these pulsars are an order of magnitude larger than those of most isolated 
pulsars. The production rate, which is obtained from the number divided 
by the lifetime, is then much lower than that of ordinary pulsars. 
In 1982 an isolated pulsar PSR 1937+21, which is spinning at 642 Hz, 
was discovered (Backer et al. 1982). The evolution of this millisecond period 
pulsar is a great puzzle. However shortly after this discovery a second mil- 
lisecond pulsar was found PSR 1953+29 (Boriakoff et el. 1983). This object 
was in orbit around an inferred low mass companion which presumably is a 
white dwarf. A swarm of models were generated at this time with the lead- 
ing idea being that these millisecond pulsars had their progenitors in the low 
mass Xray binaries which, in turn, arose from main sequence systems with 
one high mass and one low mass star. The division between high mass and 
low mass is around 8 M®, which is the nominal dividing line between stars 
that form neutron stars and those that evolve to white dwarfs. The models 
do not answer the question of how such a system could evolve to an isolated 
millisecond pulsar like PSR 1937+21. One distinguishing characteristic of 
these very short period pulsars is that their spindown rates are many orders 
of magnitude smaller than those of "normal" pulsars. Their small spindown 
rates suggest low magnetic fields (2) and low magnetic fields are required in 
most models of the low-mass Xray binaries. The age of these systems places 
a firm limit on how much decay of pulsar magnetic fields can take place. 
Certainly the fields cannot decay exponentially with a time scale of 106-~ 
years as many authors had suggested in the 1970's. The role of the magnetic 
field is critical to the binary formation models. A low magnetic field on an 
old neutron star is required to allow mass accretion into the neutron star 
magnetosphere at small enough radii so that an accretion torque can spin 
up the old, and presumably slowly rotating, neutron star to a millisecond 
period. The process is limited along a line shown in Fig. 3. 
The next episode in pulsar discovery in the 1980's was the detection 
of pulsars in globular clusters. The clusters are self gravitating systems of 
105-6 stars. They form a spherical population hovering around the center 
of our galaxy and were created very early in the evolution of the galaxy. As 
a self gravitating system, they have negative heat capacity and will collapse 
endlessly unless there is a source of heat to stir up the stars. One source 
of heat is the formation of binary systems in the core where the density is 
a million times higher than that in the solar neighborhood. Imagine what 
the night sky would look like there! One type of binary will be a neutron 
star and a low mass companion. These binary systems are made harder by 
further collisions, and eventually will evolve first into Xray binaries and then 
into millisecond pulsar binaries. The tree of possibilities is much richer than 
just outlined. In the cluster 47 Tucanae there are no less than 10 millisecond 
pulsars. 

228 
Fruchter et al. (1988) reported the discovery of a millisecond binary 
pulsar PSR 1957+20 that is eclipsed once per orbit by a halo of material 
surrounding the companion. This system had the properties of a system that 
Ruderman et al. (1989) had considered theoretically - that of a close binary 
where a portion of the rotational energy lost by the pulsar is deposited on 
the companion and ablates material from the companion's surface. They 
were considering scenarios by which low mass binary pulsars could eventu- 
ally become single. A second system undergoing eclipses was found in the 
globular cluster Terzan 5. In this second case the "weather" in the ablation 
and subsequent wind formation processes is such that occasionally eclipses 
last for several orbits. These objects are very exciting. They have whittled 
their companion down to just 0.02 M®, and provide new constraints on 
the form of energy and momentum loss by the pulsar as a consequence of 
its rotation. These systems seem to fill the gap between binary millisecond 
pulsars (and low mass Xray binaries) and solitary millisecond pulsars. The 
gap is further filled by the recent (post-school) firm detection of a pulsar 
with planetary companions (§5.5). 
Scientists are often swayed into believing, and stretching, a strong, com- 
prehensive idea or set of ideas. What you have just read may well be such 
a case. There is still no solution to the formation of an isolated, low field 
millisecond pulsar in the binary evolution model described. Now we have an 
object that, while not isolated, only has planetary mass companions. Other 
ideas may need strong consideration. One is that single millisecond period 
pulsars can be formed ab ini~io with low magnetic fields. Another is that 
single pulsars may be formed from the coalescense of either white dwarf or 
neutron star binaries. Neutron stars can also form in binaries where both 
systems were low mass as normal stars. The formation of one white dwarf 
can be followed by mass accretion that supercedes the limit for a white 
dwarf, 1.4 M®, and leads to neutron star formation. The collapse to a neu- 
tron star may be accompanied by a residual disk within which planetary 
mass coagulation (§5.5) can occur in a manner similar to that proposed for 
the solar nebula. 
In conclusion let me mention that a neutron star spinning 642 times 
per second has an equatorial speed of 0.15 c. At rotation rates only slightly 
larger, and here slightly is dependent quantitatively on the equation of state 
for the stellar interior, the star will be unstable to the growth of a triaxial fig- 
ure that would emit gravitational radiation and tend to slow the star down. 
The fastest neutron stars may be very close to their rotational limit. Future 
pulsar surveys with good sensitivity for 1.0 millisecond rotation periods are 
required to support this contention.

5.2 Keplerian Binary Pulsar Timing 
If the neutron star under observation is a member of a binary system, then 
one must transform the arrival time from the barycenter of the binary sys- 
tem to the neutron star before proceeding with analysis of the spin param- 
eters of the star. A classical description of this transformation is based on 
Kepler's laws of motion. Figure 10 is an aid to understanding the geometry 
of a distant binary system. The center of the sphere is both the center of 
mass of the binary, and one focus of the pulsar's elliptical orbit. The plane 
of the orbit is inclined by an angle i with respect to the plane of the sky. 
The intersection of the two planes defines the line of nodes, which has a 
position angle on the sky X. The periastron point in the orbit, the point 
of closest approach of the two bodies, is at an angle ~v measured from the 
line of nodes. The masses of the pulsar and its companion are ml and m2, 
respectively; m = ml + m2. 
The location of the pulsar in the orbit with respect to the line through 
the binary barycenter and the periastron point is given by the true anomaly 
u. This line, which is along the major axis of the ellipse, is the line of apsides. 
The mean anomaly is a uniformly increasing phase angle M = I2b(T - To), 
where To is the epoch of a periastron passage , Y2b = 2~r/Pb, and Pb is the 
binary orbital period. The eccentric anomaly E is an angle defined on a 
circle that just encompasses the orbital ellipse. The origin of E is the line 
of apsides, and the projection of the radius of the circle at angle E onto the 
line of apsides is identical to the similar projection of the pulsar location on 
the ellipse. Kepler's equation relates the mean and eccentric anomalies: 
M 
= ~-2b(T -- To) = E - e sinE, 
(28) 
where e is the eccentricity of the orbit. Further trigonometry relates the 
eccentric anomaly E to the true anomaly u, so that the plane polar coordi- 
nates (R1, u) of the pulsar relative to the binary barycenter are determined 
by 
Rl=al(1-ecosE), 
and

The component of this motion along the line of sight is the one that affects 
the arrivM time, 
5tb = al sin i(1 -- e cos E) sin(u + w). 
(3t) 
For an approximation one can substitute M into the above equation for 
both u and E to obtain an idea about the variations of 5tb. There are 
five Keplerian parameters that must be determined for an elliptical orbit: 

231 
Pb, al sin i, e, ~, and To. These provide a constraint on the mass of the corn- 
pan_ion which is known as the mass function: 
f(ml) = ,Q~(al sini)3/G = (m2 sini)3/m 2. 
(32) 
The timing of a binary must proceed from an initial determination of 
its orbit using Doppler data alone, apparent periods, to a more precise 
orbit which is obtained by phase connecting the data which uses the above 
formulation for 5tb.

5.3 Relativistic Binary Pulsars 
A pulsar in a short orbital period binary with a massive companion will 
require post-Keplerian corrections to its timing model. The largest effect 
is the secular advance of the line of apsides in an inertial reference frame. 
The corresponding effect in the solar system is the advance of perhelion of 
the planet Mercury. A second relativistic effect is the counterpart of the 
relativistic clock correction for an Earth clock which was presented in §4.2. 
The neutron star rotation is a clock, and we must transform from coordinate 
time in the binary barycenter to proper time in the orbital frame of the 
neutron star. These relativistic parameters depend on orbital phase with 
independent signatures so that the masses and the inclination of the system 
can be determined. A fundamental development in pulsar research is the 
detection of the orbital period decay in PSR 1913+16 that is most likely 
the result of a back reaction to gravitational radiation by the binary mass 
system (Taylor et al. 1979; Damour £: Taylor 1991). The over determination 
of the elements of the system that is provided by the three effects mentioned 
above allow one to actually predict the gravitational wave orbital decay and 
hence compare the observations to theory. Binary pulsars provide the only 
experimental evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation. 
The light travel time of signals from the pulsar through the gravitational 
potential of its companion provides a further effect, just as it does for prop- 
agation past our Sun, which is detectable in several binary pulsar systems. 
Damour &: Taylor (1992) have developed a post-Keplerian parameterization 
of the weak and strong field effects that are, or may be, detected in binary 
pulsar signals. 
The most prominent relativistic effect is apsidal motion of the orbit. 
This is so large, and the measurements of PSR 1913+16 by Taylor and 
his colleagues have been so precise, that proper modeling of the data must 
take into account that the motion is not uniform along the elliptical orbit. 
The time averaged rate of apsidal motion can be calculated from the simple 
Einsteinian formula:

The fourth relativistic effect is the decay of the orbit that results from 
the back reaction to emission of gravitational radiation. The field equations 
of general relativity for a dynamic system reduce to a wave equation for the 
perturbation of the spacetime metric about its flat space form in the limit 
of small perturbations, or weak fields and slow speeds. While the pertur- 
bation of the spacetime metric in the immediate vicinity, of a neutron star 
is not small (i.e., does produce strong field effects), the binary system is 
much larger and weak field calculations are probably sufficient. The ques- 
tion of constraints on strong field parameters from binary pulsar timing 
observations is now under consideration (Damour &: Taylor 1992; Taylor ct 
al. 1991). The orbital decay rate ~2b and time scale Tb -- -~b for two point 
masses in General Relativity is given by 
~2b = 96 a ~/3 rnlrn2 (1 + ~e 2 + ~e 4) o11/3

(38) 
In (38) the two masses are taken to be 1.4 M® neutron stars and f(e) is the 
ellipticity factor from (37). For the dual neutron star binaries with orbital 
periods of 0.3 days and modest eccentricities gravitational radiation will 
lead to a coalescence, or explosion, of the two stars on a time scale of 100 
million years. This means that there are many events like this in the lifetime 
of our galaxy, and that these are moderately common events in the manifold 
of galaxies. 
5.4 Globular Cluster Pulsars 
One fascinating result from the cluster pulsars is their use as probes of 
the gravitational field in cluster cores. The apparent period of a pulsar is 
affected by its space motion. Motions in clusters have small velocities of a 
few tens of km s -1, and these Doppler shifts are inseparable from the period 
measurement. The acceleration of a pulsar would similarly not be detectable 
as it contributes to the period derivative. However for several pulsars now 
the period derivative is negative, unlike any noncluster pulsars. A direct 
inference is that acceleration by the cluster potential which results from 
the enclosed mass, and perhaps a contribution from nearest neighbors, has 
reversed the sign of the apparent effect. For the M15A pulsar this requires 
an acceleration of 6 × 10 -5 cm s -2 - roughly akin to accelerating uniformly 
from our school into downtown Graz in 24 hours! 

234 
During the past year the uncertainties in the timing parameters of the 
ll-ms pulsar in M4, PSR 1620-26, have been resolved - it now is clear that 
there is a large period second derivative. The probable interpretation of this 
effect is that this pulsar, which is in a 191 orbit with a low mass companion, 
is encountering another object as it moves through the cluster. While this 
is a straightforward explanation, one can predict the rate of encounters of a 
given accelaration, or acceleration derivative, from the presumably known 
quantities of cluster density and velocity dispersion. In this case the observed 
effect is many orders of magnitude larger than expected - a riddle to be 
solved in future studies. An alternative explanation is the presence of a third 
bound object in the system. Its orbital period would need to be sufficiently 
large so that all we detect is the cubic phase residual which is what a period 
second derivative produces. Furthermore its orbital period would need to be 
large to maintain stability - three body systems with commensurate orbital 
periods are unstable. However a weakly bound third object can be stripped 
easily from the system as it moves around in the cluster encountering other 
stars. The riddle remains. 
5.5 Planets around Pulsars 
At the time of these lectures Bailes et aI. had just announced the detection 
of a perturbation of the arrival times of PSR 1829-10 that indicated the 
presence of a 6 x 1028 g companion in a 6-month orbit. The key word here 
is "6-month orbit". By 1992 January the authors had retracted this stun- 
ning result. They had made a serious error in data analysis which is worth 
reviewing for its lesson (and not to make fun of the authors). Pulsar model 
parameter fitting is an iterative process as outlined in §4. Improved model 
parameters, if they are valid, will always predict arrival times better than 
former ones. The method of determining model parameter updates is often 
an approximate one where intrinsically nonlinear functions are linearized by 
differentiation, and perhaps simplified, to form the equation of condition. 
The fit for position components is an example. The motion of the Earth is 
complicated, but is approximately an annual sinusoid in ecliptic longitude. 
This approximation is used in the determination of improved coordinates of 
a pulsar once there is no period ambiguity in the pulsar model over inter- 
vals of one year, or more. The approximation is satisfactory, provided that 
one iterates until the model fitting no longer updates the parameters. At 
that time, it does not matter at what level the fit model approximates the 
correct equation of condition - the data agree with the model applied ex- 
actly. Bailes et al. had the misfortune of starting with a large position error. 
As I understand their process, they used an approximate model for adding 
the position correction they determined into further analysis runs. This left 
them with a 6-month sinusoidal residual that was easily fit to perturbation 
of the distant pulsar by a planetary companion. 

235 
The story ends on an upbeat note. Wolszczan & Frail (1992) reported 
the detection of a pair of planets around the 6-ms pulsar 1257+12. The 
amplitude of the perturbation is around 1 ms for each and the periods are 
nearly in 3:2 resonance, 66.6 and 98.2 days. Comparison of their model with 
our data confirms the presence of these periodic residuals from a simple 
spin model (Backer et al. 1992). While various authors have put forward 
alternative models involving precession of the pulsar neutron star, the proof 
of the planetary hypothesis will come in a few years when the expected 
Newtonian orbital perturbations of the two orbits are adequately observed 
(Rasio et al. 1992). Various parameters of the two orbits are expected to 
"osculate", with a small amplitude and a period of 6 years, owing to the 
near resonance of the orbital periods. 
6 Pulsar Timing Array 
In §4.0 the methods of pulsar timing and the parameters required for inves- 
tigations of isolated and binary pulsars were discussed. The data for each 
pulsar were treated independently using a model of the Earth's space-time 
coordinate as a function of epoch that is assumed to be more accurate than 
the precision of the pulsar data. In this section the limits of this model 
are discussed, and the influence of a stochastic background of gravitational 
radiation on pulsar arrival times is presented. The section concludes with 
a description of the use of an array of precisely timed pulsars to solve for 
global parameters that affect all objects in a correlated manner. The ideas 
presented here were the subject of a recent workshop - The Impact of Pulsar 
Timing on Relativity and Cosmology, 1990 June, Berkeley (workshop notes 
are available). Ideas concerning a Pulsar Timing Array are developed by 
Foster ~z Backer (1990) and R~mani (1989). 
6.1 Time Coordinate 
In §4.2 I described the transfer of time from a standards laboratory to the 
observatory. We are interested, of course, not in some fuzzy, metaphysical 
concept like time, but in the very concrete concept of time interval, or its 
inverse, frequency. The time coordinate for us is just the numbered sequence 
of cycles of a frequency. We are comparing rotations of our star to the 
fundamental oscillations of an atomic quantum transition. There are two 
concepts used in evalation of the quality of a standards laboratory time 
scale: accuracy and stability. 
The atomic time scale is determined by defining the second, and by 
identifying an epoch. The second of Terrestrial Time is 9,192,631,770 cycles 
of the frequency corresponding to a fine structure transition in ground state 
of the Cesium 133 atom at sea level. (An accurate definition of what we 

236 
mean by sea level is currently being negotiated.) The epoch when atomic 
time reads some value, such as zero or 2440000.0 days 0 seconds, is not of 
particular concern here. What does concern us is the accurate realization 
of this definition. How do we make a device that produces this countable 
frequency that is stable from now until forever? The answer is that it is 
not easy. The measurements of transitions of Cesium atoms are affected 
by temperature, magnetic fields, vibrations of the room, interactions with 
contMner walls, and so on. Many of these effects can shift the frequency. The 
task of achieving high accuracy is to identify all such systematic influences 
and remove them. 
If the systematic shift in an atomic clock is constant, then the clock can 
be very stable, but not accurate. If the shift varies with time, then the clock 
is both unstable and inaccurate. Time averaging can improve the stability of 
the clock if the shifts average to zero sufficiently rapidly with increased a~er- 
aging time. A stability analysis always involves a time scale of measurement. 
Instability mechanisms have a characteristic time scale and amplitude. For 
example, if the clock is affected by temperature, then one would expect 
changes at various rates: (a) an air conditioner cycle; (b) daily; (c) yearly. 
Often the amplitude of instabilities increase with an increase of time scale. 
It is just tougher to stabilize a clock over long scales, than over short time 
scales. Allan at the National Institutes of Standards &: Technology devel- 
oped a useful algorithm to characterize oscillator stabilities as a function of 
measurement interval. Consider a series of time difference measurements, 
~tij = tij - toj 
of clock i relative to clock 0 with measurement index j. 
Assume that clock 0 is perfect. Then form the Allan standard deviation: 
0.5 
<: [(~tij+l -- ~tij) -- (~f;ij -- ~tij-1)] 2 >j 
= 
, 
(30) 
where r = tj+l --tj 
is the interval between measurements. The double 
difference in this measure removes slopes between clocks since one is inter- 
ested in stability not accuracy. The measure is also known as the fractional 
frequency stability since one can write the statistic in terms of fractional 
frequency differences, (~tij+l - ~tij)/r. 
If the numerator is independent of 
time, the stability is limited by measurement interval only. This is often true 
on short time scales where a signal is being measured against a background 
of white, frequency independent, noise. On longer time scales unwanted, 
and uncontrollable influences ultimately set a limit on or. A stability floor is 
reached. On longer time scales the stability typically degrades even further. 
This characterization is true for every oscillator ever measured: electronic 
crystals, atomic clocks, the rotation of the Earth, and my Casio watch (Fig. 
11). 
The stability floor for the best Cesium atomic time scales is around 
10 -14 on time scales of six months to a year or so (Fig. 11). The PTB scale, 
from the German standards laboratory, is evaluated as the best in existence. 

237 
The BIPM in Paris is responsible for the collection and comparison of time 
scale data from around the globe. They form two time scales: International 
Atomic Time (TAI) and Terrestrial Time (TT-BIPM); the former is by 
agreement with all participants, and the latter is their formulation that 
they claim is the best scale for use in precise pulsar timing (Guinot and 
Petit 1991). A stability of 10 -14 corresponds to a numerator of 0.4 #s in 
(39), or a typical timing residual of 0.3 #s for time intervals of one year. On 
longer time scales estimates of stability suggest a modest rise with interval. 
The atomic time community has made steady progress with accuracy and 
stability since time keeping began ~ starting with the Stonehenge era. Keep 
this limit in mind when we come to discuss the timing of an array of pulsars. 
6.2 Space Coordinate 
In §4.3 the transformation of the pulse arrival time event at the observatory 
to the corresponding arrival time event at the solar system barycenter, the 
local inertial reference frame was discussed. This transformation requires ac- 
curate estimation of the barycenter to observatory vector at the time, which 
is on an inertial clock time scale, of the observatory pulse arrival event. We 
use an ephemeris of the Earth's motion as a function of time to estimate this 
vector. The ephemeris is constructed from a detailed model of solar system 
dynamics that includes the Sun, all planetary systems, minor planets, and a 
band of matter representing the asteroid belt, and uses an appropriate level 
of relativistic effects (e.g., Ash et al. 1967, Standish 1990). The parameters 
of this model are adjusted to fit data from all observations - from ancient 
eclipses to recent satellite planet flybys. The table below gives the current 
estimates of the errors in planetary masses, and the corresponding offset 
between the estimated barycenter location and the "true" location. These 
mass errors are large with respect to asteroid and cometary masses, but 
comparable to masses of the largest minor planets and larger moons. The 
barycenter will also be shifted by errors in the celestial coordinates of the 
planets, but a list of these errors is not readily available. 
We can take these mass errors and simulate their effect on pulsar timing. 
The arrival time transformation is effected by a scalar product between the 
observatory vector, which is of order 500 s - the AU - in length, and a unit 
vector in the direction of the source. This means that the planetary timing 
error for pulsar j in direction fij will be 
(Amp ~ rp(t), fij(t), 
c6tpj(t) = Zp \ M® ] 
(40) 
where Amp and rp are the mass error and position, respectively, of planet 
p. Figure 12a gives a simulation of this error for one pulsar with the Arn/s 
taken as those in Table 3.

The simulation in Figure 12a is for 90 years. If we have only 10 years 
of data, then a large part of the variations, which are dominated by the 
orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, will be absorbed in fits for the pulsar epoch, 
spin, and spindown rate. Figure 12b shows such fits in 10-year segments. 
Figure 12c shows the final residuals that one would expect to see from 
the mass errors in the current ephemeris calculations. An amplitude of a 
fraction of one microsecond is typicM. The residuals for different pulsars 
will appear different as a result of the dot product in (40). There will be a 
slow variation around the sky with a dipole signature in the residuals. The 
dominant temporal variation will be cubic.

6.3 Gravitational Wave Background 
6.3.1 Influence of Gravitational Radiation on Pulsar Timing 
Following the review of Backer and Hellings (1986) and references therein I 
start with the metric of a spacetime interval as perturbed by gravitational 
radiation that is specified by its dimensionless strain amplitude, h: 
ds 2 = c2dt 2 -dz 2 - (l+h cos 2¢)dx 2 - (1- h cos 2¢)dy 2 - h sin 2¢dxdy. (41) 
This expression results from a vacuum solution of Einstein's linearized 
field equations. The solution corresponds to a temporal spectrum of plane 
gravitational radiation propagating along the +z-axis with amplitude h(t - 
z/c), where h is an arbitrary function of (t - z/c), and ¢ is the constant 
polarization angle between the principal polarization direction and the x- 
axis. The Earth and the pulsar are assumed to be at rest. We choose the 
origin of the coordinate system at the Earth, and place the pulsar in the 
xz-plane at an angle 0 from the propagation direction of the gravitational 
radiation (the +z-axis) and at a distance I from the Earth (Fig. 13). 
A photon emitted at the pulsar and moving toward the Earth will follow 
a path in fiat space that may be written as 
x = (l - c~) sin 0, 
y = 0, 
z = (l - a) cos 0, 
(42) 
where s is the distance parameter. The null geodesic may be written as 
c2dt 2 -- (1 + h cos 2¢ sin 20)da 2. 
(43) 
Inspection shows that the influence of the gravitational radiation appears 
as an index of refraction, albeit one that changes with space and time, 
and that the photon propagation will be advanced or retarded compared to

its vacuum path in flat space. Integration of the above equation from the 
spacetime event of emission at the pulsar (T, l) to the spacetime event of 
reception at the telescope ( t, 0) gives 
1 
c(t - T) = l + ~c(1 - cos8)cos 2tb[H(t) - H(T - lcosS/c)], 
(44) 
where H(u) is the indefinite integral of h(u). 
Consider the plane wave case where h(t - z/c) = ho sin(wt - kz), where 
k = ~/c. Substitution leads to 
c(t - 
T) = I - 
l hoc(1

- cos(~t 
- (~l/c)(1 
+ cos 0))]. 
2 w 
(45) 
Photons from the pulsar arrive early or late according to the product of 
an amplitude ho/w, an angular factor in (8, ~b), and the sum of two phase 
factors. The second phase factor is from the incomplete phase of the wave 
in the vicinity of the emission event, near the pulsar, and the first is from 
the incomplete phase in the vicinity of the reception event, near the Earth. 
The first term will be correlated for all pulsars observed, as discussed later, 
while the second term is uncorrelated amongst the objects for M1 but very 
nearby emitters - small wl(~r - 8)2/c. 

242 
The angular factor winds through two =E cycles as the polarization angle 
moves around the sky transverse to the emission direction. This demon- 
strates the quadrupolar signature of the radiation. As 0 goes to zero the 
residual delay goes to zero, where the photons travel in the reverse direc- 
tion of the wave. This demonstrates the transverse nature of gravitational 
radiation. As 0 goes to zr the absolute value of the residual delay increases 
toward 2 from the angular factor in 0, but eventually goes to zero as the two 
phase factors cancel exactly at 7r where again the photon path is parallel to 
the wave. For a wave period of one year and a pulsar distance of 1 kpc, this 
cancellation will occur only for 0 much less than 0.4 °. 
Pulsar timing has reached the level of 1 #s for timing severn pulsars 
over intervals of a year. This provides a sensitity to gravitational radiation 
with dimensionless strains of ho -~ 3 x 10 -14. 
6.3.2 The Spectrum of a Stochastic Background of Gravitational Radiation 
In the preceding section the effects of a single wave on the pulsar arrival time 
were considered. In the more general case h(t) will contain a full spectrum 
of waves. Furthermore there will be waves coming from arbitrary directions. 
Consider first the spectrum. An arbitrary function h(t) has the Fourier 
spectrum 
// 
h(w) = 
h(t)exp[jwt]dt. 
(46) 
For a stochastic variable one is interested in the power spectral density 
Pc(w) --- Ih(w)l 2. If the statistics of h(t) are stationary, then the integral 
over the power spectrum is equal to the integral of the variance over the 
data (ParsevN's Theorem). 
I; 
I/ 
PG(w)dw = 2~r 
h(t)2dt. 
(47) 
oo 
(2~ 
The units of h are dimensionless, while those of h are t, and those of PG are 
then t 2. This exercise in transforms and units is necessary if one wishes to 
take a segment of the spectrum and turn it into an effective wave amplitude. 
In the case of discretely sampled data, the corresponding relation is: 
5w 
= 
(4s) 
where 6t is the sample spacing, 6w is the resolution of the spectrum, 1/T, 
and T is the duration of the data sampled. Pc/6t has "density" units of 
variance per frequency interval in the spectrum. 
One assumption about the gravitational wave background is that it is 
scale invariant with equal energy density in each octave, or decade, of the 

243 
spectrum. The energy density of a wave with amplitude h and frequency w 
is given by 
-- 
- 
(49) 
Pa- 8~rG 
8rcG 
A spectrum of waves then leads to a spectrum t~G(W). If this spectrum 
contributes equal energy per octave, then pa(w) = poWo/W. The constant 
poWo is referred to as the logarithmic spectrum because one integrates it 
with d In w which is dimensionless. 
The results of §6.3.1 can now be combined with this spectrum discussion 
to convert an arrival time precision over a time interval T into a limit on 
the gravitational wave background logarithmic energy density spectrum. 
Consider timing residuals with an rms of 1 #s over ten years. If sampled ten 
times per year, then these would produce a discrete power spectral density 
with amplitude 2 #s 2 y, i.e., 2 #s 2 per frequency interval of a cycle per 
year. This corresponds to a power spectral density Pc~St of about 10 -19 
at one cycle per year frequency. The energy density per cycle per year of 
the spectrum is then 2.5 × 10 -26 g cm -3. And finally the energy density 
per logarithmic interval is 2 × 10 -3~ gcm -3. This value scales with the 
amplitude of the residuals squared, which follows directly from (45,49). The 
value also scales with frequency to the fourth power: two factors from (49), 
one from the conversion of timing residual into wave amplitude (45) and 
one from expressing the results in terms of a logarithmic spectrum. 
The energy density of background radiations are typically expressed in 
terms of the density that is required to close the universe, pc = 2 × 10 -59 g

6.3.3 Sources of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background 
In this discussion the focus is on sources from energetic phenomena in the 
early universe. The origin of the stochastic background can be discussed 
in a number of ways. One classification of sources is by their temporal 
character: short bursts from isolated, violent astrophysical events, quasi- 
periodic sources from rapidly spinning or orbiting bodies, and the broad- 
band, stochastic background. Carr (1980) summarizes the possible contri- 
butions according to whether the source is primordial, by which he means 
having its nature related to the structure of the early universe, or generated, 
by which he means some object forms and then radiates gravitational radi- 
ation according to the quadrupole formula. A related categorization simply

uses the epoch, or temperature, of the universe at the time the stochastic 
background is formed. 
Let's start with the primordial sources and work forward in time through 
the evolution of the detectable universe. A thermal distribution of gravitons 
from the Planck era is possible. If this spectrum decouples and evolves 
into the present era, then it will be redshifted down below the microwave 
background spectrum to wavelengths of order 3 mm, or a temperature of 
1 K. This is not of interest to the pulsar timing measurement. Grishchuk 
(1977) has given arguments for a nonthermal spectrum. The existence of a 
stochastic background of gravitational radiation at this early epoch creates 
an anisotropy which, if sufficiently large, would affect nucleosynthesis of 

245 
Helium and other light elements. Carr (1980) places a limit of ~g = 10 -4 
from this consideration for periods ranging from 1 s to 300 y (Fig. 14). 
Further limits on the spectrum resulting from early epoch anisotropy can 
be placed using the isotropy of the microwave background. Gravitational 
radiation with amplitude ho, in the present era can induce a quadrupole 
term in the microwave background comparable to ho, and radiation at the 
time of recombination can produce smaller scale anisotropies. 
The next class of primordial sources occur during the QCD transi- 
tion from the false-vacuum phase to the radiation-dominated phase, and 
are a mix between Carr's primordial and generated sources. Starobinskii 
(1979) considered the production of gravitational radiation by structural 
inhomogeneities during this transition interval, and came up with a broad- 
band, scale invariant spectrum. Witten (1984) discusses processes that oc- 
cur at the beginning of the radiation era where bubbles of low-temperature 
phase, quark nuggets, amidst the high-temperature phase will collide. He 
summarizes the principal sources of the stochastic background in an ex- 
cellent appendix. Turner and Wilczek (1990) have developed the ideas of 
gravitational-wave production by nucleating and percolating bubbles during 
extended inflation era between phases. Their spectrum is not very promising 
for the pulsar timing experiment (Fig. 14). Other sources have been consid- 
ered which involve nucleation of the low temperature phase by impurities 
such as magnetic monopoles, cosmic strings and texture. Furthermore black 
holes could be produced in this era whose collisions and evaporation could 
add to the stochastic background. 
Vilenkin (1981) developed the spectrum that would be produced by a 
cosmic strings that come out of the phase transition era and survive to act 
as seeds for galaxy formation. These topological defects in spacetime form 
closed oscillating loops and decay be emission of gravitational radiation. 
Matter falls into the loop and remains after the decay. Vilenkin's spectrum 
is divided into three parts according to whether the loop forms and decays 
wholely in the radiation era, or forms in the radiation era and decays in the 
matter era, or forms and decays wholely in the matter era. The strings form 
on the scale of the horizon and then evolve with twists and connections to 
form loops. Various authors have made detailed models of the evolution of a 
network of strings with both galaxy formation as one result and observable 
consequences in the microwave and gravitational wave backgrounds as the 
constraint (Bennett and Bouchet, 1990). 
Finally let me turn to a post-galactic source of generated radiation. The 
standard model for quasars, and active galactic nuclei in general, is mass 
accretion onto a massive black hole, M --- 106-9M®. Now galaxies and pre- 
sumably quasars live in clusters where tidal interactions and collisions are 
likely during the lifetime of the system. There is considerable evidence for 
galaxy mergers, cosmic cannibalism. The existence of massive, binary black 
holes is a clear possiblity. Sillanpaa et al. (1989) have recently discussed the 

246 
case for a binary black ho!e driving the nearly periodic outbursts of the radio 
source O.1287 with interval of 10 y. Begelman et al. (1980) have previously 
looked at the mechanism and time scales for binary black hole production, 
while Bland.ford (1979) considered the coalescence rate for massive black 
holes in the universe as a source of short wavelength gravitational radia- 
tion. The new lines of evidence in favor of energetic events in galactic nuclei 
suggest that the contribution of these objects to the stochastic background 
needs to be reconsidered. In particular, the accretion of smaller black holes 
into orbit around a principle black hole is a likely scenario given the obser- 
vations. A single source, as calculated by Detweiler (1979), will produce a 
dimensionless strain of 
h _ 2 x 10-17( 1+ zh°'67(Th-°'67(D--~h-l( m---2--P~l'67~( m--A n,e),

where z is the redshift, n is the harmonic number, T is the observed time 
scale which is connected back to the binary period using the redshift and 
harmonic number, D is the distance, mp is the primary black hole mass, m8 
is the secondary black hole mass, and f is a function of order unity. A hole 
of mass 109 would lead to a 30 ns effect over one year period. While this 
is currently unobservable, a contribution of 100 such objects emitting with 
random periods and phases would bring the effect up to observable levels. 
6.3.4 Basis Function for Pulsar Timing Array Measurements 
The program of timing an array of millisecond pulsars for the detection 
of a background of gravitational radiation requires a set of basis functions 
which can be used to fit to the data. There are five degrees of freedom in 
the perturbations of the space time metric that result from an arbitrary 
form of gravitational radiation. In §6.3.2 a wave along one direction with 
an arbitrary polarization was analyzed. The effects of three waves can then 
be superposed to obtain the net effect of an arbitrary signal. 
The formulation of Detweiler (1979) is most useful for computation of 
the angular distribution of the perturbation that each degree of freedom 
has on the pulsar data. His formulation gives the Doppler shift for a wave 
incident along the z axis with orthogonal polarization components h+, h× 
as a function of the direction cosines of the pulsar a,/~, 7- 
(a 2 -/32)h+ + 2a~Sh× 
z = 
(52) 
2(1 + 7) 
The Doppler shift is just the time derivative of the timing residuals, R(t). 
The perturbations of the space-time metric are then formed by permut- 
ing (51) for waves along the x, y, z axes: 

247 
(53) 
which sums to 
['hx+ + hu+

ht~v = [ 
hx× 
hz+ - h~+ 
hz× . 
) . 
(54) 
\ 
hu× 
hz× 
-hy+ - hz+ 
This final matrix is symmetric and trace free. The five degrees of freedom are 
then hm, h12, h13, h22, and h23 with h33 -- -hzz - h22. The instantaneous 
Doppler shift patterns can then be computed for each degree of freedom from 
the constituent parts that are expressed by Detweiler's equation. Fig. 15 
displays the hll pattern. Note that there is considerable angular structure in 
this pattern beyond the quadrupole. The signature of gravitational radiation 
on an array of pulsars will be distinct from that of the other effects - the 
clock which has a monopole angular signature and the earth orbit which 
has a dipole' angular signature. 
This discussion has avoided mention of the temporal signature of the 
various effects. Only time variations of any effect will be detectable owing 
to the fact that we do not have an absolute measure of the pulsar distance. 
Furthermore linear and quadratic effects will also be absorbed into the de- 
termination of the pulsar rotation parameters which are also unknown a 
priori. Only cubic and higher order temporal modulations will be available 
for fitting to these global effects on the pulsar timing array (Foster & Backer 
1990). In the case of the Earth orbital perturbations the angular and tem- 
poral basis function for various solar system parameters will be available 
because the errors arise in limited precision of known physical effects. 
6.4 Pulsar Timing Array Experiments 
The goal of timing an array of millisecond period pulsars is just coming 
within our reach with the experiments in progress. The most detailed study 
has involved timing the original millisecond pulsar PSR 1937+21 since the 
installation of improved data acquisition hardware in late 1983 (Stinebring, 
Ryba, & Taylor 1990; Ryba 1991). Since 1985 data was recorded at two 
radio frequencies so that dispersion measure variations could be removed. 
Data from a single pulsar can be used to place a limit on the gravitational 
wave background spectrum as outlined in §6.3.2. The importance of the 
results presented by Stinebring et al. is that they show a "signal" in that 
the residuals are not consistent with white noise. The residuals appear to be 
dominated by a cubic term in phase over the 5 years of dual frequency data. 
The amplitude of this cubic term is about 1 #s. The origin of this effect 
is unknown. There are a number of candidates. The atomic time scales

be thought of as right ascension of 360 ° horizontally and declination of 180 ° ver- 
tically. 
available are no more stable than 10 -14 over durations of a few years (Fig. 
11). This corresponds to a residual of 1 #s which is comparable to the 
observed timing residual. The ephemeris of the Earth's motion as presently 
provided does not include the latest values of the outer planetary masses. 
The resultant contribution of the ephemeris to timing residuals is then worse 
than that presented in Fig. 14 and Table 4; a microsecond of ephemeris 
error is also possible. Stinebring et aL attribute the systematic residual to 
a combination of intrinsic timing noise (§4.5) and interstellar propagation 
effects 
Most of their discussion is reserved for the important new 
limit that they can establish on the gravitational wave background, 
/2c < 9 x 10 -s for frequencies near 0.14 y-1 
(55) 
with 68% confidence. Ryba (1991) improves on these limits by a factor of 
four with somewhat extended data span and improved data analysis. 
f2a < 2.5 x 10 .8 for frequencies near 0.14 y-1 
(56) 
with 68% confidence. 
A number of programs are underway at several observatories to time the 
best millisecond pulsar "clocks". These are summarized in Table 4. Other 

249 
observatories such as Parkes and Jodrell Bank are also involved in millisec- 
ond pulsar timing, but with less emphasis on pulsar timing array aspects. 
We started a pulsar timing array experiment in 1987 shortly after the 3- 
ms pulsar in the globular duster M28 was discovered. Our first results are 
described in Foster & Backer (1990). We have made steady progress in sen- 
sitivity improvements, and have started dual frequency observations that 
allow removal of effects of dispersion measure variations. Timing residuals 
for three of the pulsars in our program are displayed in Figure 16. We are 
continuing to explore methods of improving the sensitivity of this experi- 
ment by improved receivers and new signal processing hardware. The goal is 
to have timing residuals at or below one microsecond for a modest number 
of pulsars distributed across the sky. 
The present timing array is starved for objects distributed around the 
sky. The recent discovery of strong millisecond pulsars in the southern sky 
will help in this distribution once their timeability is established. The high 
latitude pulsar PSR 1257+12 seemed to be an ideal object owing to its 
location and its flux density. However observations now demonstrate that it 
has at least two planetary mass companions around it and possibly more. 
This circumpulsar "space junk" would seem to ruin it as a good clock, while 
making the astrophysics of the system a delight! Searches are underway to 
discover more objects throughout the sky. The future is reasonably bright 
that a significant number of new clocks will be found.

Fig. 16. Pulsar timing array data from experiment in progress at the NRAO 140ft 
telescope. The display contains timing residuals for PSRs 1821-24, 1855+09 and 
1937+21. The 6-parameter model that is fit to the PSR 1821-24 data leave 3 
degrees of freedom. The PSR 1855+09 data is compared to the model derived by 
Ryba (1991) with only a relative epoch removed. The PSR 1937+21 data is also 
compared to a model from Ryba (1991) with a relative epoch and a small period 
difference removed.

1. What is stellar astrometry ? 
This series of lectures is meant to present the most accurate and perfor- 
mant astrometric instrument that has ever been put into operation. We 
are going to describe this instrument, how it works and what results are 
to be expected on the basis of what has already been achieved by this sa- 
tellite. However, I believe that before entering into a detailed study of an 
astrometric instrument, one should have some background on this do- 
main of astronomy, I shall restrict it to stellar astrophysics since this is 
the very first objective of HIPPARCOS even if a few 10 -4 parts of its obser- 
ving time is spared for minor planets and a couple of natural satellites. 
So let us ask ourselves the following questions : 
i) What is stellar astrometry? 
ii] How was it done before HIPPARCOS? 
iii) Why do we need astrometry 
iv) What is the expected contribution of HIPPARCOS? 
I.I. What is stellar astrometru? 
Astrometry is the domain of astronomy that is assigned as an objective to 
determine the positions of celestial objects. Since these positions gene- 
rally vary with time, the objective is also to describe their motions as a 
function of time. I shall not deal here with tasks that, by extension, be- 
long also to astrometry, such as the determination of other geometrical 
properties of celestial bodies such as their dimension and their shape. 
In the case of stars, the primary objective of an astrometric pro- 
gram is to determine as accurately as possible positions for a given 
epoch, and then, as time goes, to derive their variations that are used to 
determine their proper motions and their parallaxes. Another objective 
is to describe quantitatively double and multiple star systems. If these 
three objectives have definitely an astrophysical impact, the study of posi- 
tions and their time variations is also basically an astrometric objective 
that permits to make better astrometry {see section 2.2) through the 
construction of reference frames and fundamental catalogues. 
1.2. Methods of astrometnj 
There are three different categories of astrometry depending upon the 
portion of sky that can be tied into a single reduction of observation. 

256 
i) Semi-global astrometry - It is characterized by the possibility to link 
positions of stars that may be in different parts of the sky. The only ll- 
mitation is that they should be accessible to the instrument. The main 
instruments of semi-global astrometry are the transit circle (or meri- 
dian instrument) and the astrolabe. They are the basic instruments for 
the construction of star position catalogues. Recently a visual Michelson 
interferometer in Mount Wilson Observatory achieved the same types oF 
measurements (Shao et al., 1988). There is only one global astrometry 
instrument: it is HIPPARCOS, the only which can make measurements 
over the entire sky. 
ii) Small field astromctry - Its objective is to determine the positions of 
stars in a limited sky field. Typical instruments are photographic astro- 
graphs or Schmidt cameras. Their contribution is to extend catalogue 
positions obtained by semi-global astrometry to many more - generally 
fainter - stars. In long focus telescopes, the objective is to measure pa- 
rallaxes and study widely separated double or multiple stars. For such 
very small fields, CCD's advantageously replace photographic plates. Se- 
veral other techniques exist; let us mention only the FGS (Fine Guidan- 
ce Sensors) of the Hubble Space Telescope. 
iii) Star image analysis - In these techniques, there is no reference to 
stars with known positions. The objective is to recognize and measure 
double or multiple star systems, or to measure stellar diameters. Inter- 
ferometers, whether speckle or Michelson, are the main instruments 
for this type of astrometry. 
A description of the presently existing astrometric instruments 
can be found in Kovalevsky (1990). 
1.3. Whtl stellar astrometnl? 
There are many good reasons to determine apparent motions of stars. 
They fell essentially into two categories. 
i) To imorove the knowledge about the star and its ohvslcal state -The 
basic parameter is its parallax. Trigonometric parallaxes are the calibra- 
ted origin of all other methods to extend the distance scale by compa- 
rison of apparent magnitudes of objects having the same physical cha- 
racteristics such as spectrum, variability or temperature and therefore 
the same luminosity. Trigonometric parallaxes allow to calibrate the 
bases of these extrapolations. All possible types of stars should have ac- 
curately measured parallaxes. If, in addition, orbital elements of double 
or multiple stars are determined from astrometric or photometric ob- 
servations, the parallax permits to determine the masses of the compo- 
nents. 
The knowledge of parallaxes is also necessary to transform appa- 
rent magnitudes into real luminosity, apparent diameters into diame- 

257 
ters expressed in kilometers, and proper motions into velocities. 
ii) To study the structure, the kinematics and the dvnamics of stellar 
groups - The basic observable is, for thcse studies, the annual proper 
motion. It allows to study motions within clusters, to recognize stellar 
association membership, to analyze motions in the Galaxy, etc... They 
are a statistical indicator of stellar population types and are a major 
input in the studics of the relations between kinematic and chemical 
composition, age and/or spectra of stars (Galactic evolution). 
From kinematical observational data, on can infer dynamical pro- 
perties of the Galaxy and its evolution with time. As examples, one may 
mention the evolution of spiral arms, the search for matter distribution 
explaining the galactic gravitational field or the evolution of clusters. 
It is to be highly encouraged to have parallaxes and radical veloci- 
ties for as many stars as possible in the Galaxy since it would allow much 
more detailed analyses of the kinematic properties of the Galaxy. 
1.4. Present situation and expectations from HIPPARCOS 
The present situation of astrometry is summarized in table 1 which gives 
the order of magnitude of the precision of various astrometric techni- 
ques. This precision depends upon the magnitude of stars and upon the 
quality of the instrument.

It is to be remarked that the observing programme of astrolabes 
and interferometers include a systematic reobservation of the same ob- 
Jets so that more precise catalogues may be derived. The same would be 
true for meridian circles, but at present they are essentially used to in- 
crease the number of astrometrically observed stars. Long focus instru- 
ments (e.g. US Naval Observatory 61 inch astrometric telescope in Flags- 
taft) are used essentially to determine parallaxes. 
The results of positional observations are collected and published 
in star catalogues. Table 2 gives the characteristics of the main star cata- 
logues. It is to be remarked that the nominal precision given does not 

258 
represent the actual precision in 1990 because of the degradation due to 
the absence of proper motions or their bad quality. This is essentially the 
case of the astrographic catalogue and of the SAO catalogue.

The HIPPARCOS mission is expected to provide a catalogue of 
118000 positions, annual proper motions and parallaxes with a mean ac- 
curacy for stars of magnitude 9 of the order of 0.0015 arc seconds. Pre- 
sently, we know only about 5000 proper motions to better than 0.002 arc 
seconds and, for I00000 other stars the errors are of the order of 0.005 
to 0.015 arc second per year. In addition there are probably systematic 
errors of the same order of magnitude. There are a few hundred paralla- 
xes that are known to one millisecond of arc (mas) and may be another 
thousand have a precision of 2 or 3 mas. The other 7000 parallaxes are 
evaluated with errors of 5 mas or more. So one can say that it is expected 
that HIPPARCOS will improve by about one order of magnitudes the pre- 
sent quality of known astrometric parameters of stars and multiply by ten 
the number of measured parallaxes. Furthermore, the additional TYCHO 
experiment wiU provide the same astrometric parameters of 800000 
stars with a precision of about 10 mas. 
2. Principles and problems of stellar astrometry 
The physical information that an astrometric instrument gets, is the di- 
rection from which the light emitted by a star arrives on the telescope or 
whatever light collector simple or complex is used. 
This short statement immediately brings up two fondamental ques- 
tions : 
1. Has this direction any relation to the direction in which the star really 
is? Is'nt this direction time and observatory dependent? 
2. When one speaks about directions, one has to mention in what coordi- 
nate system or, as astronomers call it, in what reference frame it is re- 
ckoned? 
Let us elaborate somewhat on each of these two aspects. 

259 
2.1. What direction is of interest to astronomy? 
A simple example suffices to give a positive answer to the first question. 
Atmospheric refraction depends upon the zenith distance of the star 
which varies with time during the night. In addition, zenith distances of 
a given star vary from one observatory to another. Clearly, astronomers 
want directions that are independent of the observing conditions and 
consequently of the presence of terrestrial and even solar system envi- 
ronment.Therefore, we shall define the direction of a star as the dircc- 
tion from which the light would arrive if the solar system would not exist. 
Let us note that this is different from the direction in which the star 
really is. It is actually the direction in which the star was when it emitted 
the light that is received, provided that between the star and the solar 
system rays had not been bent by interstellar matter refraction or relati- 
vistic light deflection, To know where the star is at present has not much 
astrophysical interest. To obtain it, would imply that correction for pro- 
per motion are made and that the distance is known so that the light 
time can be computed. 
To correct the observed apparent positions in order to obtain posi- 
tions fit for astronomical use is a rather complex procedure which rcqui- 
res a very accurate knowledge of some physical quantities concerning the 
environment or the kinematic conditions in the solar system. The cor- 
rections that have to be applied are : 
i) Atmospheric refraction - In order to make this correction, one needs 
to have a model of the atmospheric refraction, to measure the parame- 
ters that enter into the model (temperature. humidity, atmospheric 
pressure at the telescope) and add some additional parameters deter- 
mined in the process of observation reduction. 
ii) Aberration - This effect is proportional to the velocity of the observer 
with respect to the only point that would be unchanged if the solar 
system was to be neglected, namely the barycenter of the solar system. 
This includes accurate knowledge of the motion of the Earth around 
the Sun and of the Earth rotation. 
iii) Relativistic light deflection by the Sun and, if necessary, by other bo- 
dies of the solar system.• 
2.2. Astronomical reference frames 
Because instruments have always been attached to the Earth, the defini- 
tion of the system of reference celestial coordinates has been and still is 
strongly connected with the orientation of the Earth in space. Because it 
is an observable common to all geographie locations, the direction of the 
Earth axis of rotation has been chosen as the fundamental OZ axis. In the 
principal plane, the equator, an origin has to be chosen. It is the equino- 
xial point, at the intersection of the equator with the ecliptic. The pro- 
blem is that both equator and ecliptic are moving in time, so that while 

260 
observations are related to the instantaneous pole. the actual reference 
system must be fixed conventionally. This is done by defining a reference 
at the conventional epoch J.2000.0 together with an ecliptic and an 
equator in which all periodic motions would have been averaged out. In 
order, then, to express observations made in the instantaneous reference 
system to the conventional fixed system, the following corrections have 
to be applied. 
i) Earth rotation parameters - They include the angular rotation of the 
Earth as refered to the instantaneous equinox, expressed generally in 
terms of UTI and the polar motion. Both are unpredictable and arc 
monitored by various techniques (VLBI, Laser ranging), the result 
being compiled and distributed the International Earth Rotation Servi- 
ce (IERS). These parameters are used to transform local celestial coor- 
dinates generally obtained by astrometric instruments into geocentric 
instantm~cous celestial coordinates. 
ii) Nutation and precession - They are respectively the periodic and the 
secular parts of the time dependent developments that describe the 
motion of the instantaneous axis of Earth rotation with respect to the 
conventional fixed reference system and therefore are to be used in 
transforming the instantaneous coordinates of a star into coordinates 
in the fixed reference frame. Theoretical developments are presently 
unsufficient for very accurate astrometry and whenever necessary, ob- 
served values published by IERS must be used. 
iii) Stellar parallaxes - The apparent direction variations due to themo- 
tion of the Earth around the Sun have to be taken into account whene- 
ver known. 
The coordinate grid system is obviously not directly observa- 
ble and even the direction of the celestial pole is not accessible to many 
instruments. It is therefore necessary to have flducial points all over the 
sky to represent the coordinate system. This is realized by fundamental 
star catalogues (presently FK5) in which star positions are given at the 
reference epoch together with their time variations due to proper mo- 
tions. Other catalogues extend the FK5 to a larger number of stars (e.g. 
IRS: intemational reference stars). They allow to obtain star coordinates 
in local relative astrometry, for instance for photographic plate reduc- 
tions. A detailed description of all the transformations involved in the 
reduction of astrometric observations of stars can be found in Green 
(1985). 
2.3. At)•lication 
to space astrometru 
The two principles applied in the two preceding sections for Earth based 
observations do apply also to space astrometry. 

261 
i) Apparent to true position transformation - Evidently, refraction correc- 
tion desappears. Concerning the aberration, one has to know accurately 
the orbital motion of the satellite about the Earth and add it to the mo- 
tion of the Earth about the solar system barycentre. The speed of satel- 
lite rotation is a negligible contribution. Finally, the problem of relati- 
vistic light deflection remains the same with the addition of the effcct 
of the Earth itself. 
ii) Reduction to a fixed rcfer¢ncc frame - When observations made by a 
satellite are devised to give star coordinates, and not simply rclativc 
local coordinates as in the astrometric mode of the Hubble Space Te- 
lescope, the transformation betwcen the observed quantities referred 
to some coordinates in the satellite and the stellar rcference frame im- 
plies an accurate knowledge of the position of one with respect to the 
other. In other terms, the oricntation in space of the satellite must bc 
know with an accuracy comparable to the expected precision of the ob- 
servations. This orientation (called attitude by space engineers) is the 
equivalent of the ensemble Earth orientation parameters, nutation and 
precession in .on-ground astrometry. The difference is that there is no 
independent networks to determine it, so that an astrometric satellite 
must be also a satellite that determines by itself its own orientation in 
space. This is not the simplest part of the satellite design and of the 
data reduction, even if, as is the case for HIPPARCOS, both functions 
(attitude determination and astrometric observations) are interrelated 
and are mutually supporting each other. 
In any case, neither the celestial equator nor the ecliptic being ob- 
servable by a satellite, fundamental stars must be observed so as to en- 
sure the necessary link with the conventional reference frame. 
3. The HIPPARCOS mission 
The first astrometric satellite ever built, HIPPARCOS was constructed by 
the European Space Agency and launched on the 8th of August 1989. It 
has a very elongated orbit around the Earth with an apogee around 
500km and apogee close to 36 500km. Its period is 10h 40m. The tele- 
communications with Earth are secured by three ground stations, Oden- 
wald (Germany) which is the master station of ESOC (European Space 
Operation Center) controlling the other two stations: Perth in Australia 
and Goldstone in California, Well distributed in longitude, they cover 
about 95% of the orbit and almost 100% of the useful observing time. 
The name of this satellite, apart from recalling Hipparchus. the au- 
thor of the first star catalogue and discoverer of precession, is an acro- 
nym that stands for "High Precision PARallax OOllecting Satellite". Iiis 
based upon an idea of P. Lacroute in 1966 but could be realized only 
much later when space techniques became sufficiently advanced and 

262 
after many other scientists and engineers have come to a feasible and 
performing project that was approved in 1981 by ESA. Later, it was ex- 
tended by the adjunction of the TYCHO experiment proposed by E. Hoeg. 
Nominally, the satellite should have been launched in a geostationnary 
orbit which would have simplified the operations and avoided some diffi- 
culties in the scientific data treatment, particularly for the attitude re- 
constitution. But due to the failure of the apogee motor, the mission had 
to be adapted to the new orbit. It is this actual HIPPARCOS mission that 
is described here and the reduction procedures take into account the 
rcal orbit. 
3.1. General Drinciole of HIPPARCOS 
Astrometry reduces itself to measurements of angles. In global astrome- 
try, one must measure large angles. This is done on-ground by measuring 
times between transits of stars through well defined circles (meridian or 
almicantarats). Using the relation between time and the angle of rotation 
of the Earth, time is transformed into angles. In the case of HIPPARCOS, 
this is also done through the satellite attitude, but this would be unsu[I1- 
cient. So the fundamental idea is to have a standard angular yard-stick 
materialized by the angle between two mirrors called the beam-combiner 
which are reflecting into the telescope two stellar fields separated by 
twice the angle between the mirrors. This basic angle 7, is equal to 58 °. 
Within the field of view, one has to measure small angles.

263 
This is done in the focal plane by letUng the satellite slowly rotate around 
an axis parallel to the intersection of the mirrors of the beam-combiner. 
In the focal plane, a grid made of equidistant slits, modulates the light of 
the stars and the apparent angular distance between stars is determined 
by comparing the phases of the modulation curves (figure I). 
The combination of these three types of acces to angular determi- 
nations is the basis of the astrometric use of the satellite. 
3.2. Descriotion of the satellite and of its ~auload 
The satellite has a general six faced paraUelepipedic shape with a prisma- 
tic top and three large solar cell panels perpendicular to the main cor- 
pus. Light enters through two baffles and falls on the beam combiner 
which is a 29cm miror cut into two halves and glued at a 29 ° angle. This 
angle is very stable (see figure 2). It has no variation larger than I mas in 
24 hours and its secular variation was 2 mas per month in the beginning 
of the mission and is getting smaller with time. From the beam combiner 
the light is reflected by a plane mirror towards a spherical mirror with a 
focal distance equal to 140cm. The optical configuration is actually a re- 
fracting Schmidt telescope and the fourth order corrections are carved 
in the beam combiner mirrors. The focus is somewhat behind the plane 
mirror which has a central hole. In the focal surface, set on a silicon 
substrat, are the grids. In the center is the main grid consisting of 2688 
parallel slits with a period as measured in projection on the sky is 1.208 
arcsec with 39% transparent width. This covers a field of 0°.9 x 0.9 ° on 
the sky. In both sides of the main grid are two "star-mappers" , one of 
which is redundant. It consists first of fourth "vertical" (that is parallel to 
the main grid) slits the width of which is 0".9 and the separation respec- 
tively a, 3a, 2a with a=5".625. A second system of four similarly separated 
slits but inclined by 45 ° in a chevron configuration completes the star- 
mapper (figure 3).

MAIN GRID 
- Star-mapper and main grid structure. 
The light received by a star-mapper is split into two beams by a di- 
chroic plate so that each of the two photomultipliers receives different 
wavelengths corresponding roughly to B and V filters in the UBV system. 
These photomultipliers sample the received light intensity with a fre- 
quency of 600 Hz. 
In the main grid, it was not possible to adopt the same system be- 
cause it is necessary that each star be observed independently of others. 
This is made possible with the use of an image dissector instead of a 
plain photomultiplier. An image dissector can separate from the rest of 
the field of view a very small portion of it. In the case of HIPPARCOS, it is 
a circle of about 30" in diameter. The centre of the receiving area is con- 
tinuously computed on-board using the star coordinates provided by a 
priori known approximate star positions and the on-board attitude. As 
the result the deflection circuits of the image dissector are controlled so 
as to make the recorded photons to be produced by the area centered on 
the tracked star. The sampling from the image dissector is registered at 
a 1200 Hz rate. A very detailed description of the satellite and the pau- 
load is given in Perryman and Hassan (1989). 
3.3. Observinq strategy 
The stars to be observed by HIPPARCOS have been carefully chosen for 
their astrometric or astrophysical interest with the additional constraint 

265 
that they are evenly distributed over the entire sky. A little more than 
118 000 stars have been selected and their positions, magnitudes and 
other already known features from ground-based observations, are collec- 
ted in an "Input Catalogue" which is being distributed among the astrono- 
mical community. The sky is scanned with the satellite rotating in 2 
hours and 8 minutes so that a star crosses the main grid in about 19 se- 
conds. The rotation axis moves slowly, circling the Sun in 57 days kee- 
ping an angular distance of 43 ° from the Sun. In a 3 I/2 year mission that 
is presently contemplated, each star will be observed between 30 and 
100 times depending upon its position on the sky. 
Clearly such a complex attitude behaviour cannot be achieved natu- 
rally. Whenever the attitude as monitored on-board departs from the no- 
minal scanning law by more then 10 arc minutes, gas Jet actuators are ac- 
tivated so as to reverse the natural attitude trend. Actually, this happens 
about 12 times per satellite rotation and more often near perigee. The 
on-board attitude determination is based upon three active gyroscopes 
and observations of star transits through the star-mapper in a manner 
that is analoguous to the way that data reduction consortia do it a poste- 
riori (see section 5). 
At a given time there are several program stars in the combined 
field of view. During an observation frame of 32/15th of a second, a maxi- 
mum of ten stars are observed by a rigourous sequencing of individual ob- 
servations. Unless a program star enters or leaves the field of view during 
the observation frame, the same stars in identical configurations are ob- 
served 16 times forming 16 interlacing periods. In each interlacing pe- 
riod, each star is observed an integer number N of 8 sampling periods of 
1/200s; N is large for faint stars so as to compensate at least partly the 
small number of photons. The 20 groups of 8 sampling periods are distri- 
buted among stars proportionnaly to N in such a way that there is no 
unused time. When there are entering or leaving stars, there may be two 
or three different strategies adopted with and without these stars. 
The satellite transmits to the ground all photon counts from the 
main grid and continuous photon counts from the star-mapper. In addi- 
tion, it sends the values of the coil currents that have been used for the 
image dissector pointing, the on-board computed attitude and some en- 
gineering data on how the instrument behaves (temperature, tensions, 
etc...). This is elaborated on ground by the ESOC control centre and sent 
to the Data Reduction Consortia together with relevant data on gas Jet ac- 
tuations, orbital motion of the satellite, quality and availability of data, gy- 
roscope readings, eclipse or penumbra situations for the satellite. Con- 
cerning the star-mapper data, all the readings are sent to TYCHO data re- 
duction consortium. For the main mission reduction, only observations of 
program stars on the star-mapper are transmitted. 

266 
3.4. The INPUT cataloque 
The principle of HIPPARCOS implies that one observes stars on a pro- 
gram. This means that a list of stars to be observed had to be made and 
the positions and magnitudes of these stars must be known in advance 
sufficiently well so that 
1. they can be used for the on-board attitude determination: from an ap- 
proximate knowledge of the positions and the crossing times observed 
by the star-mappcr one can obtain a sufficiently accurate attitude (bet- 
ter than 1") permitting the IDT to be centered on the stars to be ob- 
served; 
2. for most of the stars, the position error be significantly better than 
0".5 to avoid grid-step errors due to the undiscemability between slits 
in a periodic grid; 
3. magnitudes be known to better than 0.5 magnitude so that the obser- 
ving time be correctly determined. Special treatment in almost real 
time is made for variable stars; 
4. for the calibration of photometric determinations, some 15 000 stars 
have magnitudes known to better than 0.02 magnitude. 
All these informations and some other have been gathered or obtai- 
ned by observations by a large consortium of more than 50 astronomers 
of 9 countries to which many other observers Joined. A total of more than 
150 persons contributed to this work. 
The result is a data base containing data for about 215 000 stars ac- 
cessible at the Centre de Donn~es Stellaires in Strasbourg. The data con- 
sists whenever available or pertinent, of 
- Position 
- Proper motion 
- Parallax 
- B and V magnitudes 
- Spectral type 
- Radial velocity 
- Variability type 
- Double or multiple star information 
These 215 000 stars are all stars requested in 210 scientific pro- 
posals as an answer to an ESA announcement of opportunity. 
Only 118 000 of these stars were finally selected for the actual pro- 
gram of observation. The same data, but generally better because of the 
observations performed in 1982-1989 will be published as the HIPPAR- 
COS INPUT Catalogue and is used by the data reduction consortia (Perry- 
man and Turon, 1989). The position accuracy as referred to 1990-1991 
proved to have a r.m.s, of 0".25, although some stars may be wrong by 
1".5 or 2" and a few misidentification have now been detected. 
In the next sections, we shall discuss the methods used for the 
reduction of the data collected by the satellite. A much more detailed 
description can be found in Perryman et al. (1989). 

267 
4. Reduction of grid data 
Whatever is the technique adopted to make astrometric measure- 
ments, one must determine the position of star images on the focal surfa- 
ce either directly or on a reproduced image like in photography or CED 
detection. A star image is not point-like, but is a certain distribution of 
light over a finite area. This distribution is the diffraction figure in the 
best of cases as in HIPPARCOS, or blurred in addition by atmospheric agi- 
tation in ground-based astrometry. 
It is well known that for circular apertures, the diffraction pattern 
is composed of a central circular speck and a number of fainter rings. 
The dimension of the central spot is of the order of 1.22X/D where D is 
the diameter of the entrance aperture and ~. the wavelength. For different 
shapes of the entrance pupil, the light distribution is more complicated, 
but as a general rule, the characteristic dimension in a given direction is 
of the order of ~./D where D is the diameter of the aperture in this direc- 
tion. 
In the case of HIPPARCOS, there are two entrance pupils, one per 
field of view, but they are equal and symmetric. The shape is half an el- 
lipse, projection of the beam combiner mirror on the wave front with a 
central semi-circular obturation due to the hole of the plane mirror. The 
overall size is 29cm by 13cm. The larger dimension is along-track. The 
resulting diffraction pattern is elongated along the vertical direction and 
is thinner along-scan. For ~.=0.501~m, the characteristic size is 2.11£m, re- 
presenting 0".31 on the sky. 
The objective is to recognize some particular point of the diffrac- 
tion pattern that will, by definition, represent the image of the position 
of the star. This is quite legitimate, provided that the algorithm would 
give the same result in different conditions or, in other terms, that the 
distances between such conventional points are correctly representative 
of the angular distances between stars independently of their magnitudes 
or colour. Let us present the situation in the case of single stars for 
which the characteristic point should be the maximum of the light dis- 
tribution for a symmetrical diffraction pattem. 
4.1. Liaht modulation bu a veriodic arid 
Let us consider a grid with a period s and a transparent section whose 
width is s'. Let x o be the abscissa, perpendiculary to the grid system of a 
characteristic point of the star image and let f(x-xo) be the integratedin- 
tensity of light for any abscissa x. Thus, the light intensity collected by 
elementary slit dx is 

268 
dl = f(x-x o ) dx . 
If the abscissa of the centre of a transparent slit is u, the total iUu- 
mination transmitted by the grid is 
S" 
u=ks+~

u'=-ks- ~

One can see that if k-~k + 1, I remains unchanged. Therefore it is a 
periodic function with a period equal to s. Let us now assume that the 
image moves along the abscissa axis at a rate -v. This is equivalent to say 
that the slit moves with respect to the image with the rate + v. One has 
eos2~--s--t+ 
I(t/= I o ÷ 11 eos~---~--t + 41

where ~1 -.. are phases and 11 ... are modulation coefficients. It has aspatial 
frequency equal to 1/s and a time frequency equal to s/v. This develop- 
ment is rapidly converging. If the characteristic width of f(x-x d 
Is w, 
the cut off spatial frequency Is of the order of s/w. 
One may take for w 
the half intensity width of the diffracted image along the x axis. Note that 
it Is wavelength dependent. In practice in most of the useful cases, it is 
sufficient to keep only the two first harmonics 
I (t) = I o + ! I cos(cot +4) + 12 cos2(.mt+~'). 
where m =2re v/s is the pulsation. 
If the image is symmetric, p=@ '. This may not always be the case, in 
particular for double stars or in case of coma. We shall therefore keep 
both phases in what foUows.

Let us consider N counts F(t i ) at times t i {I < i < N) an d let us as- 
sume that the transit velocity of the star is constant so that aJ is constant 
between t ] and t N 
. Each observation gives the following equation obtai-

These equations are linear in the five unknown parameters and N 
is large compared to 5. It is therefore possible to solve this system by 
least squares and transform back the results to get I o, /'I, /'2, ~ and ~ '. 
Generally, the astrometric quantity required is the abscissa of the 
star at time t =0. All that can be obtained from the phase s is the distance 
from the centre of thc transparent section, since if ~ = ~' = 0, the intensi- 
ty is maximum. 
Assuming ~ -- ~', the offset from the centre of the slit for t =0 is

a choice between the 
above algorithms which are no more equivalent must be made. 
But in what slit the image was at t =0 is not known and cannot be 
derived from this analysis. Other means, involving an a priori approxima- 
te knowledge of the positions of stars, must be used as it will be descri- 
bed in actual examples. If the slit number k in which is the star is known, 

270 
then the abscissa of the image is

In the case of double stars, #'## , but the form of the response is 
the same, since the function l(u) is periodic too. The interpretation in 
function of the star centers is much more complicated (see section 8). 
However, during one RGC, when the stars present themselves in the 
same relative ways the same "pseudo centroid" is observed and determi- 
ned on the main grid. 
4.3. Liaht modulation bu a sinale slit 
The star-mapper consists of four slits whose separation (5".6) is such that 
a star illuminates only one slit at a time. Therefore, the time of crossing 
of the ensemble of the four slits is the mean of the time of crossing of 
each slit (giving the transit time through the barycenter of the four slits). 
So let us consider one such slit (width s' ). The instantaneous iUu- 
mination is given by 
s' 
u=ks + 2 
= 
[. 
f(X-Xo) 
l(u) 
dx 
u=ks- g 
2 
where u is the abscissa of the centre of the slit. While the satellite is rota- 
ting, u=vt 
l(t) = F(v(t-t o )) 
where t o is the instant at which the photocenter of the image is atthe 
centre of the grid. Photons are counted during a sample interval At .The 
corresponding illumination is 
+At/2 
J(u) = [ 
f(x-x o) dx dt 
-at/2 
while the normalized illumination, called single slit response is 
J(u) 
R(u) 
= 
+Ai/2 +f 
j f(x-x O) dt dx 
-At 12 - oo 
R(u) is calibrated from observations of a number of single star transits. Let 
R*(t)=R(u-u o) centered at the maximum of the response. Let us assume 
that, for a given observation, one obtains a series of photon counts 
n(t+nflt) and compute the correlation function 

271 
n2 
~.,(t) = ~ ~(t+n At) .R*( At- 6t) 
111 
This function is maximized for a certain ~t equal to the correction 
to be applied to t in order to fit the best the observation to the single sllt 
response. 
The four times t I t 2 t 3 and t 4 are determined in this way fobhe 
four slits. A barycentric line of the four slits is defined as the line such 
that its abscissa a is 
4 
~ as 
t=1 
4 
where ~ are the abscissae of the four silts. The time of crossing this line 
is given by 
4 
~:=~" = 
t~ 
4.4. Precision of the results 
The precision with which the time of crossing • of the mean slit is de- 
termlned, depends on the number of collected photons and therefore on 
the magnitude of the star. One may express this precision in millise- 
conds of arc on the sky, using the mean rotation rate of the satellite of 
168".75 per second, so that one millisecond of time represents 6 mas on 
~esky.

Figure 4 gives the mean precision obtained from the reduction of 
actual data. The results are better for vertical slits than for inclined silts. 
Stars of magnitude larger than 10.5 are not observable by the star- 
mapper because the signal desappears in the background noise. 
5. Attitude 
determination 
This is the most involved part of the HIPPARCOS data reduction and also 
the one on which rests the final accuracy of the results as well as the ra- 
pidity of convergence towards the solution. 
5.1. Satellite to sku transformation 
Time or phase observations arc made on a grid Fixed on the satellite, 
while the stars that are observed are referred to some celestial system of 
coordinates. A different celestial reference is defined for each data set 
covering an observing period included in one orbital period. The OZ axis 
is arbitrarily chosen as the mean position of the rotation axis of the satcl- 
lite during the useful observation. The OXY plane is called "Reference 
Great Circle" (RGC), the origine OX being its ascending note on the eclip- 
tic. It is essential to know what are the functional relations that exist bet- 
ween these two systems. Let us first define them. On the grids, the origin 
I~ will be the centre of the main grid. The I~G coordinate will be taken 
along track so that G increases with time and I'/H is directly perpendicu- 
lar being parallel to the main grid system. In this system of grid coordi- 
nates, the equations of the mean lines of the preceding star-mapper have 
ideally the form 
G = G' o 
for the vertical slits 
G = G"o - ] H I for the chevron slits 
Or generally 
G=G o + £H 
with 
I~ =- 1,0 or +I 
(5.1) 
For the satellite, we shall define a system of rectangular axes such 
that 0 being the centre of mass of the satellite, Oz axis is taken parallel 
to the edge of the beam combiner and Oxz is the bissecting plane of the 
two optical axes of the telescope. The intersection with the celestial 
sphere of the Oxy plane is the instantaneous great circle of rotation (IGC). 
It is refered to the RGC celestial coordinate system by three Eulerian an- 
gles a, ]~, & so that the transformation from the body axes Oxyz to the ce- 
lestial RGC axes OXYZ is defined by the rotation matrix (figure 5) 
It could also be written under the form of 
C = ~l(~'] ~2tB'} ~3(S') 

273 
where a', J~' and 6 are respectively the rotation angles around Ox, Oy and 
Oz. 
It is somewhat advantageous to use a combined system that separa- 
tes the along track component 
from small angles representing rotations around axes in the RGC or the 
IGC: 0=]]' and ~=a'. So that

- Grid-to-field transformation, coordinate system with respect to the IGC 
and its relations with the RGC system. 
Finally, 
let us 
define local celestial 
coordinates (figure 5). Let 
co I and o h be points for the preceding and following fields on the IGC 
separated by +7/2 from Ox . These points are very close to the points 
whose images on the grid are both in ~'l. The o h u I and oJ2u,2 axes are 
tangent to the RGC and oJ I v I and oh v 2 perpendicular 
in the same di- 
rectlon as OH. Let us note that if u i and vt (i= i or 2) local coordinates of 
a star, the coordinates in the IGC system are ~i =u/ = 7/2 and T/t = v i . 
The transformation between local grid and local celestial coordina- 
tes is close to an identical transformation, provided that we use on the 
grid a grid angular unit called grid radian such that the grid period is 
1".208 expressed in radians. It is however not an identity because of 
shifts and tilts of the grid with respect to the optical axis and of various 
aberrations of the optical system. The transformations 

274 
(1" 1) :(GH) ~ 
(u I v I ) 
( ~) :(GH) ~ (u 2 v 2 ) 
are called grid-to-field transformations for each field of view. 
Since there is also some colour dcpendent aberration in the sys- 
tem, terms proportional to the colour index c are includcd in the trans- 
formation (i= 1 and 2) 
u I = G + U l (G,H) + cU" I(G,H) 
v, = H + V t (G,H) + cV" l (G,H) 
The function U and V may be either expressed in terms of develop- 
ments in power series of G and H or by numerical tables. 
The inverse field-to-grid transformation has a similar format 
G = u I + gl (ul, vl) + cg'~ (u i , v i ) 
(5.3) 
H= v i+ h i (u i ,v i) +ch'~ (u~ ,v i) 
The transformation between the body O~jz and celestial RGC OXYZ 
systems of coordinates is the attitude. To determine the attitude means 
to find the expressions of ~ 0 and ~ in function of time. 
5.2. Eauations 
for attitude determination 
Two measurements contribute to the attitude determination: gyroscope 
readings and timing Of star transits through the star-mapper grids. 
Each gyroscope measures the inertial rotation of the satellite about 
one of three non coplanar axes called gyroscope input axes. The gyrosco- 
pe reading is done automatically by an electronic system that determines 
the torque needed to maintain the gyroscope spin axis parallel to the 
input axis. Using a torque model that includes the torques produced by 
solar radiation pressure, gravity gradient and gyroscope reaction, one can 
derive the time derivatives of the three angles W, 0 and ~.

(5.4} 
However, these readings are not sufficiently accurate nor is the 
torque model sufficiently precise to allow integrating these differential 
equations. 
The use of star-mapper observations provides a direct link bet- 
ween the attitude angles, time and the coordinates of the observed star. 
Let t be the time when a star image has been observed to be crossing a 

275 
barycentric llne of equation (5.1) 
G = Go + F_J-/ 
The corresponding line on the sky is obtained by applying the 
field-to-grid transformation (5.3). One obtains a certain equation 
F(u, v, gi, cg" t , h I , ch" t) = 0 
(5.5) 
Assuming that the field-to-grid transformation is calibrated, this 
reduces to a certain non linear equaUon 
J~u, v, AU, Av) = 0 
(5.6) 
where ~u and Av are the corrections for this transformaUon. 
If/, told fl are the coordilmtes of the star in the RGC system of coor- 
dinates, the relation between IGC and RGC coordinates are given by the 
transformation 5r(g0,~) so that, expressed in terms of/, and ~. one gets 
by elementary calculations

71 = 
v 
=y(1,, t, u/(t), 0(0, ¢(t))

(5.7) 
so that the condition expressing that the star is observed on a barycen- 
tric line of the star-mapper is of the form 
Z(A, t, 7, ~v(t), e(t), ¢(t), Au, Avl = 0 
(5.8) 
Each observation of a star-mapper transit gives a Z equation in ~v, 0 
and ¢ for different times. The quantities Au and Av are computed using 
the calibrated grid-to-field transformation. How this calibration Is done 
will be shown later. Finally ;~ and ./3 are taken from the best available star 
catalogue (Input Catalogue at the first treatment, Improved values later). 
5,3. Revresentation 
of the attitude 
Using equations (5.8) and ff necessary equations (5.4) one must determi- 
ne the three function of t . Since at a given instant, one may get only a 
single relation (5.8) between the three unknown functions of time, It is 
necessary to represent them by some analytical functions. 
The difficulty is that there exists no simple analytical representa- 
tion. Between gas jets. the functions are smooth, but the effect of a gas 
jet actuation is to modify the first derivative so that there is at that mo- 
ment a discontinuity in the derivatives. But actually, gas Jets have a dura- 
tion between 0.05 and 0.5 seconds and the passage from the previous si- 
tuation to the next is continuous. 
The simplest solution to describe this is to use cubic splines which 
are third order polynomials with continuity conditions in the extremities 
of intervals. But generally, in this case, the observations are unsufficient 
in number and this solution is not acceptable. In one of the consortia 
(NDAC), numerical integration of the modelled torques improved by gy- 

276 
roscope data is used and then smoothly upgraded by the results of star- 
mapper observations. This numcrical approach was found to give quitc sa- 
tisfactory results. In the other consortium (FAST) a fully analytical ap- 
proach was adopted and applicd in two different ways. 
i) Lon~ term reoresentation - Outside eclipses, when the torques are es- 
sentially functions only of the rotation angle ~. it has been mlalytically 
shown that the variation of attitude may be represented, in absence of 
gas jets, by a periodic function of ~v and that this function is insensitive 
to initial conditions within a certain vicinity of a given solution. If the 
time span is one satellite rotation, and the precision required is of the 
order of 0".05, these periodic functions may be developed in Fourier 
series of ~/(t) up order 15 (or less) : 
15 
~=W0 + gtn(t-tn ) + l__~l/~ COS j (gtn(t'tn)+lFj) 
(5.9) 
This development has a secular term, representing the rotation. 
There are two analoguous functions for 0 and ~. When there Is a gas Jet 
actuaUon, the initial conditions are changed, but not In a manner that 
contradicts the above results so that one can keep for all the periods 
between gas Jet actuation the same coefficients /~ of (5.9) and mofidy 
only ~n- Using the simplified relation (5.9), one has to determine the 
I~, ~j and ~n • However, one should add to it a dynamical description 
of the gas Jet effects. If 6 n is the impulsive function of the gas Jets and 
tn ,t'n are the times of beginning and end of the actuation, the first part 
of (5.9) becomes 
~= ~0+~ l(t_tn)+~2(t.tn) 
2+ ~ IAn&(t.tn)dt 
+ ... 
(5.10) 
t n t n 
Similar equations hold for the other two angles 0and ~. So, in 
summary, the integral is computed using a model and one has to de- 
termlne 90 coefficients for the trigonometric series and about 80 coef- 
ficients for the second order representation of the secular terms. The 
number star transits and consequently of equations is of the order of 
700. This is quite sufficient to determine the parameters by a least 
square procedure. 
ii) Short term representation - In case of eclipses or penumbra, the main 
cause of the torque - the solar radiation pressure - desappears or is 
quickly modified and the preceding model does not apply. Then the 
adopted solution is to represent each angle by a Legendre polynomial 
of high order (between 5 and 15). In comparison with the first case, 
the proportion of observation equations to the number of parameters 
to be determined is smaller by a factor of about 2 and the continuity 

277 
conditions are not well taken into account. This mode has to be used 
as rarely as possible, since it gives a precision which is about twice 
worst than the long term rcpresentation. 
5.4. Precision of attitude determination 
If one takes into account only the precisions obtained for the star transit 
estimates one may expect accuracies of the results to be of the order of 
20, 35 and 80 mas respectively in ~, 0, ¢. In pracUce, the modeling error 
may be large, and biases are introduced in the short term representation. 
In particular, if observations are lacking at the beginning or the end of 
the period because, the model being only numerical, it is unable to per- 
form extrapolations. In some instance errors of I" or 2" have been shown 
to exist. The long term representation, fully dynamical, does not suffer 
this drawback. It is expected from simulations, that accuracies should be 
of the order of 30, 50 and I00 mas. In real situations, this could not yet " 
be checked, since the star posiUons used are given by the Input Catalo- 
gue whose r.m.s, error is of the order of 0".25 to 0".30 and this is reflec- 
ted in the overall precision of the result. With these uncertainties, the ac- 
tual precisions for the long term representation in the first treatment 
are found to be : 
35-55 mas for ~/ 
60-90 mas for 0 
130-170 mas for ¢ 
These numbers are to be multiplied by 2 for the short term poly- 
nomial representation. 
6. Reduction on a great circle 
The data acquired by the satellite is, as we have already stated, divided 
into data sets of a few hours (from 3 to 8). The reduction on a great cir- 
cle is the first step to obtain astrometric information from the observa- 
tions treated as shown in the preceding sections. The complete data so 
gathered is the following 
- The attitude from the star-mapper. 
- Grid coordinates deduced from the phases which give only the distance 
from a central line of a slit. The slit number is deduced from the posi- 
tion of the star as given by the Input Catalogue and transferred to grid 
coordinates using the field-to-grid transformation and the attitude by 
formulae that are inverse to those used to determine the attitude. Un- 
fortunately, due to errors in the Input Catalogue, errors of one or more 
grid steps may occur for some stars. 
- 
Field-to-grid transformation, basic angle and a few other calibrated 
quanUties. 

278 
- The ordinates of the stars with respect to the RGC computed from the 
Input Catalogue positions and the attitude. 
- The thcoretlcal geometric position of each observed star at some mean 
instant t o of observation corrected for parallax and proper motion. This 
reference position denoted as t~ c (computed abscissa) is to be improved 
by the great circle reduction. At each instant t when the star is obser- 
ved, the difference between the instantaneous apparent position and 
the reference position is computed in such a way that any difference 
between the observed and computed apparent abscissa is interpreted as 
a correction to the reference position at time t o. 
6.1, The eeuations 
Let ,t. and .13 be the coordinates of the star In the RGC reference frame and 
u, v, their local field coordinates, referred to the Instantaneous great cir- 
cle (IGC). With respect to the X axis of the sateUlte, the abscissa along the 
IGC is u +7/2 (+ preceding, - following field of view). Let us take the ordi- 
nary Euler angles to represent the attitude (see figure 6) 
W-C= I'~ 
¢ =NX 
0 = RGC, IGC 
- Transformation of coordinates between the RGC and the IGC systems. 

279 
Let us compute NE 
in two different manners 
cos(NE ) = cos(NH) cos(EH) = cos(NK) cos(EK) 
= (X-ON) cos./3 
= cos(¢ + { +u) cosy 
cos(¢ 4- 7/2 + ul cosy 
cos(1.-W+¢) = 
co s/.~ 
u is determined from the observed grid coordinate, G and the other grid 
coordinate H by the grid-to-field transformation as given in section 5.1 
u = G + U~ (G,H) + cU~ (G,H) 
where third order polynomials are used to describe U and U' (i =1or-l, 
preceding or following field). So finally, 
u= 
+ E,%k c j" k +c 
cJ" k 
Solving for ~,, one gets an equation of the form 
Z = F (]~,u (i, A, A '), ~(t), 0 (t), ~b (0,7) 
In the basic equation, we assume that 
- I' is not exactly known, 
7 = 70 + A7 
- the attitude parameter ~/(t) as determined by the attitude determination 
is not sufficiently accurate: 
~/(t) = ~o (t) + A ~F(t) 
where ~/o(t) is the along scan attitude determined by the star-mapper. 
- parameters A//k and A'il k are also not well known: 
Ay k = A'~j k + &AIj k 
p 
~ 
s o 
t 
A yk -21 Vk + &A yk 
These are the unknowns that are added to &l. 
Let us compute F with the reference values and develop the diffe- 
rence. One obtains 
,~.o(]~,u 
(To,A,A'°),V/0(t),0 
(t),0 (t),~ (t)) = 
u~ 
aA "°A ijk 
~ I~o 
where ~ represents the photon noise effect on the grid coordinates and 
second order effects 0(8 2) have been neglected. 
6.2. The desian matrix 
The ensemble of these equations for all observed grid coordinates of a 
set of stars ~issumed to be well observed at each observation frame and 

280 
called active stars is a system that can be formally written in matrix form 
as 
y=Ax+e 
where e is a stochastic variable. 
It can be also written as 
y 
=A ax a +A sx s +A~x t +e 
corresponding to attitude, star and instrumental unknowns. A a and Asare 
very sparse (one non zero element per row), A t is completely filled. 
In a typical data set of a little more than 7 hours of observations, 
one has about 50 000 equations (four per observing frame). There are ty- 
pically 1000 active stars chosen for their good observations not double, 
not too faint and 25 instrumental unknowns. Two cases occur : 
1. a single uncorrelated value of A~ is computed for each of the 12 000 
observation frames. It is called the geometric solution . It is simpler, 
but steps of 1".2 (grid width) may sometime happen and no attitude 
may be determined in observation frames without stars, 
2. ~r(t) is represented in a polynomial form (spltne functions). Each func- 
tion represent some 25 to 40 observation frames. Cubic splines are de- 
fined by four parameters with some conditions at the edges, which 
slightly increase the number of equations of conditions. This reduces 
the attitude unknowns to about 1200-1500. This is the smoothed solu- 
tion , which is highly preferable but sometimes may fail if there is not 
enough observations for a given spline. 
Even in the case of the geometric solution, there are significantly 
more equations than unknowns. 
6.3. Geometric so|ution 
It is the first that is computed. The computation goes as follows: 
- Elimination of the attitude unknowns. 
- Choleski factorization of the normal equations and solution for the ins- 
trumental parameters and star positions. 
- Substitution of the solution in the observation equations and solving for 
the attitude parameters. 
The equations have a rank deficiency of one allowing all ~,be deter- 
mined modulo a constant. It is resolved by the minimum norm method, 
forcing the sum of abscissae corrections be equal to 0. 
In some cases, the reduced star abscissae cluster in batches sepa- 
rated by s-1".208 showing the existence of grid step errors in grid coor- 
dinates. One cluster is arbitrarily chosen correcting the other grid coor- 
dinates by an integer multiple of s. 
6.4. Attitude smoothina 
A second approach is then performed with attitude smoothing equations. 

281 
Instrumental parameters are not recomputed, The equation writes as 
- A t x i + y 
= A a Bx b + A s x s + e~ 
where x a =Bx b , B being the diagonal matrix of the B spline representa- 
tion. 
The computation goes as follows : 
- star unknowns are eliminated, 
- after reordering, the attitude unknowns are computed, 
- they are substituted in the equation which are solved for star abscissae. 
Therefore, two sets of attitude and star parameters are available at 
the end. They are compared using statistical tests. As a rule, whenever, 
the smoothed solution has good statistical tests, it is chosen. This hap- 
pens in about 80% of the cases. Otherwise, the geometric solution is 
kept. The most frequent cause of failure of the smoothed solution is the 
absence of observations during a short B spline. 
6.5. Passive stars 
All stars that have not participated to the main reduction are called passi- 
ve stars. Their abscissae are then determined. The instrumental and atti- 
tude parameters are substituted in the equations and star abscissae are 
computed. Similarly minor planet positions are determined: one per ob- 
servation frame. 
6.6. Accuracu 
of the solution 
The precision of the determination of abscissae on the reference great 
circle depends upon the precision of the grid coordinates which impro- 
ves as the number of photons received increases. Table 3 gives the rms 
currently obtained by the great circle reduction using the geometric and 
the smoothed solutions as a function of star magnitudes. This is compa- 
red to the mean rms of the grid coordinates over 25 observation frames, 
a typical number of observations for an actual data set treated by the great 
circle reduction

282 
This table shows that there is still place for improvement. Indeed 
in the first treatments as those made until now, the star positions used 
for attitude determination have a mean error of about 0.3 arc second. 
This introduces a bias in the abscissa determination which depends upon 
the star-mapper attitude. The calibrations used are not yet the best possi- 
ble. Possible grid step errors also shift the solution for some stars, increa- 
sing the apparent error. It is expected that all these causes of error do 
not show in the r.m.s, and that the actual accuracy is significantly worse 
than the numbers given in table 3. However, after several iterations in 
which improved star catalogues will be used, the final accuracy should be 
of the order of the r.m.s, for the smoothed solution and possibly better. 
7. Computation of astrometric parameters 
The next step of the reduction is a synthesis on the sphere. Starting 
from the projections on great circles, the problem is to find what is the 
track of the star on the sky. Each star will be observed on 30 to 50 refe- 
rence great circles out of the 3000 that will be obtained during the full 
mission. In addition, because of the rank deficiency of the great circle so- 
lution, the provisional origins of the great circles have to be determined. 
In this part of the reduction, the apparent motion must be exactly 
modelled. This excludes double and multiple stars whose determined 
centroid is direction dependent (see section 8) and those stars that may 
have grid step errors. Actually, in FAST, we have chosen a priori 40 000 
stars that are known not being double, whose positions in the INCA cata- 
logue have an r.m.s, better than 0".4 and are the brightest possible so that 
they are well observed. They are called primary stars on which a sphere 
reconstitution process is applied in order to determine the positions of 
all RGC origins. Then, the astrometric parameters can be determined for 
all simple stars. 
7.1. Sphere 
reconstitution 
Let us call ~.°o and-6°o the ecliptic longitude and latitude at time t #s 
it is assumed to be known. Let us also call #° x, #° ~ and ~ o tha'eference 
components of the yearly proper motion and the reference parallax. The 
actual values of these parameters differ by unknown quantities A~. o, A]3 e 
A# ~., A/~j3 , A~ that have to be determined. 
At a time t i, the position of the star is given by 
}~(tt ) = }~°o + A~'o + I#~ + A#~)(tl. to ) + (5 + An )( l+f(t} ) F (t,X,~)

t 
% 
~6(t i ) = BOo + &6 ° + t#°~ +A#~ J(tl .to) +(/~o + A/~ )(1+f (t)JG (t,}~6) 
where l+f(t i) is the distance between the observer and the barycenter of 

283 
the solar system expressed in astronomical units. It is given by the ephe- 
merides of the Earth motion as well as L(t t) , the longitude of the bray- 
centre. The functions Fand G are the projection factors of the parallactic 
displacement on both axes. 
Since the position of the RGC on the sky is known by the exact po- 
sition of its pole, one can compute the reference abscissa a o on the RC~ 
from its intersection with the ecliptic plane, the reference values 
o, ~ o 
etc.., and from (7.1). Linearizing the resulting expression, one gets 
o=oo+, 
 
to, ]÷ 
This has to be equated to the abscissa a* obtained by the great cir- 
cle reduction. However a o is affected by the error AI'/ of the origin and 
also by other errors that are assumed to be essentially dependent upon 
thermal effects due to the solar illumination and therefore are modelled 
as periodic functions of the angular distance to the projection of the Sun 
position on the RGC. Taking into account these corrections, one gets ge- 
neral equations of the form 
a*- a 0 = Ag At t + By A~i+AIIA#. +B/l A/~ +Cy A~ t +A#j 
k " 
{7.2} 
-~I [ Pk cos k(a*-sj ) +P'N sin k(a*-sj ) ] 
where index i refers to stars and index j refers to RGC's; Pk and p'kare 
instrumental unknowns and sj is the abscissa of the Sun on the RGC. 
With 3000 RGC's and about 400 primary stars on each RGC, one 
gets of the order of 1 200 000 equations with 200 000 unknown astro- 
metric parameters, 3000 origins and a dozen of instrumental parame- 
ters. 
Grouping the equations star by star (index i ), one may eliminate 
the astrometric unknowns and be left with about one million equations 
that depend only on the origins and instrumental unknowns. This system 
of equations is used to form the least square equations of conditions that 
are solved by an iterative method of successive approximations. There 
has not been yet any significant solution made using actual data, but simu- 
lations have shown that origins should be determined to an accuracy of 
0.4 mas even if a few grid step errors remain. 
As in the case of reductions on a great circle, the sphere reconsti- 
tution equations have a rank deficiency. A fixed and a linearly time de- 
pendent rotations do not modify the solution. These can be fixed by six 
binding linear conditions which will have to be determined later. 
7.2. Astrometric parameter determination 
Once the origins and the instrumental parameters are determined, 
these quantities are substituted in equation 7.2 and each group of equa- 
tions pertaining to a given star is solved for the astrometric parameters. 

284 
This is done not only for primary stars, but also for the others, with the 
exception of double and multiple stars. A specific algorithm has been de- 
vised in order to solve for the remaining grid step errors. This is not very 
difficult unless there is a large number of them. 
The final precision expected from this reduction depends of cour- 
se upon the duration of the mission. Because of the peculiarities of the 
scanning law, it depends also upon the latitude of the star. It is given in 
the case of the nominal mission in figure 7. The actual mission, if it lasts 
four years, should approach closely these expectations though with sligh- 
tly worst results for parallaxes and slightly better for proper motions.

8. Double and multiple star treatment 
Double and multiple stars do not give the same signal as single 
stars. It is the sum of the signals given independently by each of the com- 
ponents. If the intensity and the relative position of the components are 
perfectly known, it is not difficult to compute the five modulation para- 
meters. But the inverse problem cannot be solved from the observation 
on a single RGC. It is therefore necessary to gather all observations over a 
number of RGC's whose directions in the sky are known and solve the in- 
verse problem. 
The main difficulty arises from the fact that although the relative 
angles of RGC's are known, the absolute abscissae of the signals are not 
known, so that there is no way to transform the phases into absolute po- 
sition information, as it is done in VLBI for instance in the image retrie- 
val by the CLEAN method. 

285 
8.1. First approximation, double stars 
The only way is to start from approximate solution, and then vary 
the parameters. The basic equations are as follows where we assume the 
modulation coefficients M I and M 2 equal to a mean value. 
Let us consider the case of a double star and neglect the back- 
ground 
A I = ll+llMic°s(f°t+~1 ) +llM2c°s(2°°t+ 2~I) 
A 2 = 12+12MI c°s (oJt +~O 2) +liM2 cos(2cot+ 202) 
The sum of the modulations is 
B = Jo +JoNlC°S(C°t+Ol ) +JoN2 c°s(2c°t+ 202) 
with 
Jo = x~+12 
loNlCOSOJt cos01 -JoNl sin°~t sinO I = 
= llMiCoscot cos~ I -/iMisino~t sinO I +12MIcoso~t cos~ 2 - 12Mlsin(ot sinO 2 
giving 
JoN1 c°sO l = I iMicosO i + 12MICOS~2 
JoNisin 01 = I iMlsin~ I + 12MisinO2 
and, similarly 
JoN2cos2 02 --/" 1M2c°s2O I + 12M2cos2O 2 
JoN2sin2 02 = I iM2sin2~ I + 12M2sin2~2 
After some transformations, one gets 
The last two equations are modified putting

Let us call x=(~ i-~ 2) /2. One gets

I i/'2 si112x --

4M 1 
/l/2sin xcos x=

Solving in x , one gets the projected separation by s(~ I-~ 2)/2~ 
+ks (k is known because largely separated double stars are sufficiently 
well known). From these, one 
then 
computes 1 11 2 and since 
1 1+12 =J, are the roots c e 
1 2-J01 +(I 112) =0. 
giving 
Finally the first two equations can be modified and become 
JoNIcos(Si-~I) = I IM I + 12MICOS(¢I-¢2 ) 
JoNlsin[(~l-~l) = 
+/2Mlsin [~i-~2 ) 
e 1-~I and hence ~I. 
Similarly, the other two equations give ~2 and e 2"~2" 
Theoretically, from the knowledge of ~ I-~ 2 over two RGC's,one 
may determine the separation p and the angle of position 8 of the double 
star. This is actually computed from many RGC's. 
8.2. Imvrovement Of the solution 
Once a first solution has been obtained, it is sufficiently close to the ac- 
tual solution to permit an adjustment of all parameters. For a fixed double 
star, one would take 
P =Po +Ap 
8 =8 o + A8 
M11 = MI°+AM 11 
MI2 -- M2°+ AM12 
11 
= 11 ° +All 
and similar unknowns for the second star. 
One may also adjust linear a quadratic movements in p and 8, or 
some orbital parameters like Thiele-Innes coefficients. 
Once the solution computed by a least square adjustment is 
known, one goes back to each observation and gets residuals and the 

287 
smoothed values of 0 I'~I; 02-~I; 01-~2; 02-~2 and 
The latter provides the value of the shift from the position observed to 
that of one of the components. 
9. Iterations 
The precision and the accuracy obtained at the great circle reduction de- 
pend upon a certain number of quantities that cannot, in a first run, be 
determined with a sufficient accuracy because they use the Input Catalo- 
gue in which most of the star positions have an r.m.s, error of about 0".3 
and some stars have much worst positions. This is the case of the attitu- 
de in ~ and 8 which is not improved by the great circle reduction. This is 
als0 the case of grid coordinates ~which may have errors equal to an inte- 
ger number of grid periods because the Input Catalogue is consulted in 
order to determine to which slit the observation relates. Finally some ca- 
librations such as grid-to-field for star-mapper slits depend also on origi- 
nal star positions. 
9.1. Principle of iterations 
When a year or a year and a half of data will be collected and processed, it 
is expected that the results will be correct to 10 mas or possibly better. 
This is one and a half orders of magnitude better than the Input Catalo- 
gue. Therefore if the reduction is repeated using the new values of star 
positions, all errors Just described will desappear. The iteration procedu- 
re is based upon this remark. 
Not all the computations have to be repeated. The analysis of pho- 
ton counts on the star-mapper or on the main grid does not depend upon 
the star positions so that the times of transit through the star-mapper 
and the modulation curves by the main grid have not to be redetermined. 
The attitude is recomputed using not only the new star positions, but 
also the improved V(t) as obtained by the preceding great circle reduc- 
tion which gives results much more precise than with the star-mapper. 
Grid coordinates are recomputed in so far the grid numbers are redeter- 
mined. This gives new inputs to the great circle reduction which is re- 
peated, providing new abscissae to the sphere reconstltution and astro- 
metric parameter determination. 
This process may be reiterated if the results appear still not being 
satisfactory. Figure 8 presents the overall reduction scheme as adopted 
by FAST consortium, including the relations with other HIPPARCOS 
tasks.

9.2. Setttna the sphere rotfct(on 
Once the final sphere solution will have been obtained, the stars will be 
refered to a consistent HIPPARCOS reference frame, which will have to 
be compared with existing reference frames. It actually can be linked to 
any of them, using the possibility of a rotation and a time dependent rota- 
tion provided by the sphere reconstitution rank deficiency. If ~7~ and ~" 
are matrices representing these rotations, any star direction E may be re- 
placed by 
E'(t)=(~L +(t-t o) .~')E(t) 
and proper motion vector M by 
M'( t)=~'~{t) . 
These equations can be written for a certain number of stars 
whose position Is known In both coordinate frames and solved for ,.~ and 
~'. 

289 
It would be possible to refer HIPPARCOS to the FK5 system, since 
all FK5 stars are in the HIPPARCOS observation program. But it is better 
to link it to a more stable and better defined reference frame, the one 
constructed by VLBI and based upon the positions of quasars whose 
proper motions are assumed to be very small. 
The problem is that quasars are too faint to be observable by HIP- 
PARCOS. However, there are some radio stars which are part of the HIP- 
PARCOS catalogue and are sufficiently good radio-emitters to be observa- 
ble by VLBI, at least In its relative mode (phase locked to a near-by qua- 
sar). The accuracy With which proper motion of such star may be (and in 
two cases have already been) obtained is a fraction of a mas/year. These 
are mostly RS CVn stars which are very close binaries (separation a few 
mas) and are radio flare stars. It is not clear where the emitting point is 
fixed with respect to the photocenter observed by HIPPARCOS, but the 
important information is proper motion which is in the mean the same. 
9.3. Double and multiple star inclusion 
Another difficult point in the iteration procedure Is the Inclusion of dou- 
ble stars In the results. We have seen that the point giving the phase is 
RGC dependent and therefore is not a fixed point in the system of two or 
more stars. An additional task of the double and multiple star reduction 
ls to determine for each RGC the position of this point with respect to 
the components as shown In section 8.2. In treating the abscissae for as- 
trometric parameter 
determination, one has to correct abscissae in 
order to refer to one of the components and compute proper motion and 
parallax for this component. If orbital or linear motion has been found for 
the couple, It has also to be corrected for. Only then can one get the as- 
trometric parameters of physical double or multiple stars. 
9.4. Expected final accuracies 
Clearly, they depend upon the duration of the mission. Very precise pre- 
diction were made for the nominal 21/2 year mission. They were the fol- 
lowing (Perryman et al., 1989)

. 
They were based on an average abscissa standard error of 3.5 mas 
for a star of magnitude 9. 

290 
The conditions are now modified in the following manner : 
- Only 65% of the data is useful instead of 100%. 
- The abscissa determination seems to be about 10% better than expec- 
ted (see table 3), but one has to take into account the degradation of 
the transmission which lowers the photon counts with time. This de- 
gradation is modelled by 1+(P-1) /24, P being number of years of mis- 
sion. 
- The standard errors of proper motion improve as P -3/2. 
- The standard error of positions and parallaxes improve like P -1/2. 
From these, it results that the present expectations, as function of 
the duration P of the mission are given in table 4.

So, even with a five year mission one would get hardly the accuracy 
predicted for the nominal mission in positions and parallaxes, but a signi- 
ficant improvement (factor 1.6) in proper motions would be achieved. 
However, this is by all means better than the nominal 2 mas announced 
as the expected objective in 1980. 
10. TYCHO 
l~o~-am 
Looking back to the basic equation (5.8) that links star positions A and~ 
with respect to a celestial reference frame and the attitude angles W, 0, #, 
provided that the calibrated Au, Av of the grid-to-field transformationare 
known, one sees that the definition of the celestial reference plays no 
role. Thus, it is not necessary to restrict it to the RGC reference frame, 
but it can as well be written in equatorial coordinates as in any other. 
Also, if in the attitude determination, A and ]~ are assumed known, Vr, 0 
and # being unknown, the reverse could Just as well be true. This is the 
idea behind what is called the TYCHO program or experiment which uses 
the star-mapper observations of stars while the attitude is provided bj 
the HIPPARCOS main mission, the objective being to determine positions 
and whenever possible; proper motions and parallaxes of all observable 
stars crossing the star-mapper. 

291 
10.1. Preparation of the reduction 
In contrast with what is provided by ESA for the main mission reduction, 
all the data continuously recorded by the star-mapper is analysed. This 
analysis cannot be made without some preparation so that one knows 
where to look for significant star signatures in the data. This is done 
using a TYCHO Input Catalogue which consists of about 3 million brigh- 
test stars on the sky. It has been obtained by merging the Hubble Space 
Telescope "Guide Star Catalog" which ranges between magnitudes 8-9 to 
16-17 and the data stored in the Centre de Donn~es Stellaires that is 
principally the HIPPARCOS Input Catalogue data base. The accuracy of the 
positions in the TYCHO Input Catalogue is of the order of 1" to 2". The li- 
miting magnitudes are B =12.8 and V =12. i. It is believed that only 30 to 
40% of these stars are bright enough to be recognized. However, this 
limit ensures that wrong magnitude estimates would not significantly bias 
the completeness of the survey. 
This catalogue is being used together with the attitude data to pre- 
dict the times of crossing the barycenter of each group of slits of the 
star-mapper. For this particular task, it is not necessary to wait for final 
accurate HIPPARCOS attitude and the on-board attitude is sufficiently 
good, since its precision matches the precision of the TYCHO Input Cata- 
logue. Finally the prediction task provides also a "predicted group cros- 
sing interval" , interval of time centered on the predicted crossing time. 
10.2. Detection of stars 
A star appears in the star-mapper recordings as four peaks already des- 
cribed in section 4 superposed to a certain background. Since TYCHO 
program is aimed at measuring as many stars as possible, it is necessary 
to lower as much as possible the signal to noise ratio. For this reason, it is 
important to measure the background and then to subtract it from the si- 
gnal. 
Background is determined in building the distribution function of 
star counts over a 'frame period" of five main mission observationperiods 
and comprising 6400 samples in each channel. The distribution is com- 
posed of a Poisson distribution in the lower part due to the background 
and a more irregular distribution due to bright stars. Both distributions 
are easily separated, and the value of the background is determined from 
the median value of the lower end of the distribution. NormaUy, the back- 
ground is of the order of 3 counts per sampling period of 1/600s, but it 
increases largely when the satellite is in the outer Van Alien belts where 
it may be anything above 40 counts per sampling period, a limit at which 
even bright stars of magnitude 7 are no more detectable so that no attitu- 
de becomes available and, even if the data is recovered, no reduction is 
possible. 

292 
From time to time there is also another kind of perturbation called 
spikes. They are high counts during one or two sample periods, uncorre- 
lated between the two channels. The origin is probably fluorescence due 
to high energy protons. Using a non linear filter, it is possible to suppress 
the most conspicuous spikes. 
The detection of transits is done in a more involved manner than 
for the main mission. The reason is that one needs to get as many stars as 
possible, as close as possible to the background level, while for attitude. 
only well observed stars are useful. For this reason, several successive 
filtering are applied to the data and the counts in the four slits are folded 
together. 
10.3. Identification 
The preceding algorithm is continuously performed over all the available 
data. The detected signals may or may not correspond to real stars. It is 
necessary to recognize them from spurious transits. 
\

Figure 9 - Identification 
of star observations. 
Let us represent a map of the sky around the predicted position of 
the star. The star observed at a certain time t is on the projection of the 
mean slit on the sky at this very instant. Its locus is therefore, a straight 
line on the map. If one draws these lines for all the observations of this 
star. one should obtain lines that converge to a single point - the actual 
position of the star - within the observing errors. Figure 9 shows an 
exemple of such a 12"x12" map. The circle represents the expected er- 
rors. One can see that three observations do not correspond to the star. 
10.4. Astrometru 
For the last part of the TYCHO data reduction, only recognized observa- 
tions are kept. The equations of condition are very similar to those writ- 
ten in the sphere reconstitution. But the attitude being provided by the 

293 
HIPPARCOS main mission, the positions of the slits in the sky are exactly 
known. So, only the part relative to the star is kept, together with some 
instrumental parameters representing the grid to field transformation 
for each group of slits of the star-mapper. 
The expected precision of the astrometric reduction of TYCHO 
data is essentially derived from the vertical slit observations, which are 
almost twice as precise as the inclined slit observations (see figure 4). 
The expected positional errors for a four year mission is : 
8 mas for magnitude 9 
15 mas for magnitude 10 
30 mas for magnitude 11 
These numbers are also representative of the expected errors in 
parallaxes and annual proper motions. This is less than for HIPPARCOS 
main mission, but, of course, the real interest of TYCHO is the fact that 
such results will be obtained for about a million stars.
