Preface to the Second Edition
We are all in a continuous learning process, learn more as time goes on. After I
ﬁnished the ﬁrst edition of this book, I was made aware of a serious error in Chap. 4,
and I realized that this whole chapter needed a thorough revision. Now it is hopefully
in a form which reﬂects my general views of science, in fact, together with the
rest of the book in the form that it is now, reﬂects my current views of the human
mind, of communication between humans, and how we learn new things, that is, the
epistemic processes connected to each single person, and also to groups of people
that communicate.
As I see it, each human being can be connected to the fact that he also exists in a
physical context, and related to this context he has certain variables in his mind, what
I call conceptual variables. Some of these variables may be accessible, it is possible
to get information about them, say by doing experiments. Central to my way of
thinking is the discussion in Sect. 4.4.4 of Chap. 4: By having in mind two of these
conceptual variables, both assumed to be maximally accessible, one is under some
technical conditions able to construct a Hilbert space H , and connected to every
conceptual variable of the actor in this situation, one can deﬁne a unique operator on
H . Furthermore, imagine that the actor gets some precise information about some
maximally accessible conceptual variable, say one which takes a ﬁnite number of
values. Then these values equal the eigenvalues of the relevant operator, and the
corresponding eigenvector is the unique vector in H that contains this information
(Sect. 4.5.2 of Chap. 4). All this is derived under weak technical assumptions, not
taken as axioms of any theory.
And to each communicating group of people, one can also in principle ﬁnd a
Hilbert space, say H1, which can be constructed from the conceptual variables
that are shared by people in this group. The group may make common decisions,
and through this and through the decisions made by each individual, the group
and the people in the group can learn new things together. Again, from each
conceptual variable shared by the group one can ﬁnd an operator on H1, and precise
information can, at least when the variable only takes a ﬁnite number of values, be
modeled by an eigenspace of the operator, in the maximally accessible case a vector
in H1.

Preface to the Second Edition
Apart from the book’s mathematical content, I also take the freedom to express
my philosophy both on physics, on science in general, and even on politics and
daily life in this book. A crucial role is played by Niels Bohr’s complementarity
principle, and I also give links to Yukalov and Sornette’s quantum decision theory
and to quantum cognitive models in general.
Concerning physics, my philosophy is—in addition to different points that I have
expressed elsewhere—in close agreement with Hervé Zwirn’s convivial solipsism,
which he has explained in some recent articles, and is discussed in several chapters
here.
So, to summarize, the book is intended to have a fairly rigorous mathematical
foundation, but the basis of it is really extremely simple: I base essentially all
my reasoning on what I call conceptual variables, variables that we all have in
our minds (or share between us) when observing, when doing experiments, when
communicating, and when making decisions. By deﬁning group actions on these
variables, and using group representation theory, the whole Hilbert space apparatus
can be developed under weak assumptions. This is discussed in Chap. 4; the Born
rule and other results are developed in Chap. 5.
My hope is that this book can be read by representatives of all groups of
scientists, also statisticians that should be interested in understanding modern
physics. It is indeed written from the point of view of a statistician that himself
really has been trying hard to understand quantum theory. But at the same time I
also want to address physicists in the quantum theory society. The book contains
my ideas, as I see them at the time when writing this. I do not expect that everybody
should accept my ideas at once, but perhaps in the long run, we might be able to
ﬁnd a common basis from which we can learn more together.
Readers that only are interested in my views on quantum theory can skip most of
Chaps. 2 and 3 before reading Chaps. 4 and 5, but they should try to have a look at
statisticians’ likelihood principle before reading the arguments for the Born formula
in Chap. 5.

Preface to the First Edition
All human decisions, including those made in scientiﬁc experiments and in obser-
vational studies, are made in some context. Such contexts are being explicitly
considered in this book. To do so, a conceptual variable is deﬁned as any variable
which can be deﬁned by a (group of) human(s)—for instance scientists—in a given
setting. Such variables are classiﬁed. Sufﬁciency and ancillarity in a statistical
model used in scientiﬁc investigations are deﬁned conditionally in the scientists’
context. The conditionality principle, the sufﬁciency principle and the likelihood
principle are generalized, and a rule for when one should not condition on an
ancillary is motivated by examples. Model reduction is discussed in general from
the point of view that there exists a mathematical group acting upon the parameter
space of the model. It is shown that a natural extension of this whole discussion
gives a conceptual fundament from which the formalism of quantum theory can
be discussed. This can also be considered as an argument for an epistemological
basis for quantum theory, a kind of basis that has also been advocated by part of
the quantum foundation community in recent years. Born’s celebrated formula is
shown to follow from a focused version of the likelihood principle together with
some reasonable assumptions on rationality connected to experimental evidence.
The questions around Bell’s inequality are approached by using an epistemic point
of view connected to each observer. The Schrödinger equation is derived from
reasonable assumptions. The objective aspects of the world are identiﬁed with
the ideal observational results upon which all real and imagined observers agree.
Philosophical conclusions from my point of departure are discussed.
This is a very brief summary of this book. At the outset, it is written for several
groups of readers: (a) physicists interested in the foundation of their science, (b)
statisticians interested in the foundation of their science and its relationship to
modern physics, (c) philosophers of science, (d) students with a good background in
mathematics and (e) mathematicians with an interest in the foundation of empirical
science. To have such a diversity of readers in mind is quite a challenge. Some
will experience part of the text as rather technical; others will see the approach as
unusual compared to the way they are used to see their own science presented. I
encourage the reader to start with a relatively open mind, but also criticism of my
ix

x
Preface to the First Edition
way of thinking is welcome. The text concentrates on the foundation; there are very
many aspects of both quantum theory and statistical inference that are not covered.
On the foundational level, I argue that there is a connection between these two areas.
This may be an unusual way of thinking, especially for physicists, and it implies a
special interpretation of quantum mechanics. As an interpretation it is related to the
recent Quantum Bayesian approach, brieﬂy called QBism, but I try to emphasize
that Bayesianism is a branch of statistical inference theory, not of probability
theory. Also, I will allow other approaches to statistical inference. Looking at
quantum mechanics as related to statistical inference will presuppose that there
are data. These data are provided by macroscopic measurement apparatuses. In the
ordinary approach towards quantum mechanics, these measurement apparata are
ﬁrst discussed at a later stage; here I will assume from the beginning that they are
there.
In a discussion of a brief version of the account given in this book, the Quantum
Bayesian Ruediger Schack wrote: “The main difference between your approach and
QBism is that your approach is phrased in terms of acquiring information about
variables. QBism on the other hand is concerned with decision theory...”. I will
discuss my relation to QBism in more detail below. I appreciate that decision theory
is important, but here I prefer the Quantum Decision Theory promoted in a series of
papers by Yukalov and Sornette; see Sect. 1.3 below. Also, see my remarks to this
theory in Sect. 5.5, where I just see decision as a primitive concept. My claim is that
a theory about acquiring information about variables is important enough to warrant
a book. After all its aim is to cover the basis of statistics as a science and also very
much of quantum theory as a science. Some of my more qualitative views on the
process of making decisions are discussed in Chap.7.
Statisticians talk about data on the one hand and parameters of statistical models
on the other hand. Here, I will generalize the parameter concept in such a way that
the new concept also covers prediction and other statements about single units. I
call the new concept e-variable, an abbreviation for epistemic conceptual variable.
In a quantum mechanical setting, simple e-variables will correspond to what is
usually called observables. As a statistician I want to distinguish between these
observables and the corresponding data values that result from experiments. A
statistician will call these estimates. However, in quantum theory, this distinction
is not always clear. The reason from a statistical point of view is as follows: The
e-variables of elementary quantum theory are discrete, and experiments are often
very accurate. This result, in conﬁdence intervals, credibility intervals or prediction
intervals around the true value that may degenerate to a single point, which actually
is the true value. Thus, in such cases the distinction between estimates and true
value is blurred out, and much of statistical theory becomes irrelevant. At the
foundational level, I will nevertheless keep the distinction and insist that this is
related to statistical inference. As such, it is made in a context, as already mentioned.
The observer, and the information available to the observer, plays a crucial role in
quantum mechanics.

I acknowledge that many readers may be confused by this book, especially
readers who know a little (or more) of the usual treatment of quantum mechanics. I
think that the only thing I can offer these readers at present is a letter that I wrote to
my colleague Barbara Heller recently. Barbara is a statistician living in Chicago, and
she has a keen interest in quantum mechanics. After reading parts of my manuscript,
she wrote to me that she was confused. Here is my answer.
Dear Barbara,
I understand very well your confusion. —
What does statistics have to offer, in my opinion? It is true that statistics is
being used to a large extent by experimental physicists, but I have been looking
for something more fundamental. Can one think of quantum theory and statistical
inference as having partly a common basis? I think so, and I have tried to sketch
such a basis in my book. The common basis is, as I see it, that of an epistemic
process: a process to achieve knowledge. In the simplest case having what I call an
e-variable (epistemic conceptual variable) θ, asking a question to nature: what is θ?
And obtaining an answer in terms of information about θ.
In statistics, θ is most often a continuous parameter, and the answer can be
in terms of a conﬁdence interval or a Bayesian credibility interval. In elementary
quantum mechanics, θ can be discrete, and in a perfect measurement we can obtain
a deﬁnite answer: θ = u.
Furthermore, in quantum theory, we have what I call complementary e-variables:
think of spin components in different directions. We can obtain information about
θa and about θb, but the vector (θa, θb) is inaccessible.
In the Hilbert space formulation, an e-variable is identiﬁed with an operator, the
possible values of θ are the eigenvalues of that operator and very many state vectors
can be identiﬁed by the events of the type θ = u. I have made a point of discussing
this identiﬁcation from several points of view in my book.
Where do the probabilities in quantum theory come from? They are given by
Born’s formula, a formula for P(θb = uk|θa = uj) in terms of the state vectors. I
have a rather long derivation of Born’s formula in my book, using two premises:
(1) A focused likelihood principle, which can be motivated from the likelihood
principle in statistics, a basic principle which again can be derived from fairly
obvious assumptions: a conditionality principle and a sufﬁciency principle. (2) An
assumption of perfect rationality.
Of course, this is not the full story, but it appears to me to be a very useful
beginning for understanding quantum theory from assumptions that are related to
the basic assumptions of statistical theory.

Preface to the First Edition
I hope that this has clariﬁed my points of view to some extent, and I sincerely
hope that it may have contributed to remove some of your confusion.
∗
The readers just interested in my views on the foundation of quantum mechanics
may skip Chap.2, but Sect. 2.3 should be looked at, and the concept of likelihood
as the joint probability (probability density) of the data, seen as a function of the e-
variable/parameter (Sect. 2.1.2), should be understood. Section 3.2 may be dropped
if the generalized likelihood principle of Sect. 3.2.4 is taken for granted.

Chapter 1
The Epistemic View upon Science
Abstract This chapter gives the background for the book. Its relation to other views
on the foundation of quantum theory is clariﬁed and discussed. The fundamental
notion of an e-variable (epistemic conceptual variable) is explained, discussed,
and is related to the statistical parameter concept. A quantum state is in some
generality linked to a question-and-answer pair, and an experiment connected to
such a question-and-answer pair is described for the case of a spin 1/2 particle.
Two basic postulates of quantum theory are stated and discussed. The important
notion of an inaccessible conceptual variable is stressed, and this is related to Bohr
complementarity. Other topics brieﬂy discussed here are the PBR theorem, quantum
decision theory, the toy model of Spekkens, and the recently proposed quantum
philosophy, called convivial solipsism.
1.1
Introduction
The aim of science is to gain knowledge about the external world; this is what I
mean by an epistemic process. In its most primitive form, the process of achieving
knowledge can be described by what (Brody, 1993) called an epistemic cycle: “Act,
and see what happens”. Experiments in laboratories and observational studies done
by scientists are usually much more sophisticated than this; they often require
several epistemic cycles and also higher order epistemic cycles acting upon the
ﬁrst order cycles. An experiment or an observational study is always focused on
some concrete system, it involves concrete experimental units, and it is always
done in a context, which might depend on conceptual formulations; in addition
the context may be partly historical and partly chosen by the scientist himself, or
depending upon the scientist. An additional important element should be added: A
good experiment should start by formulating a speciﬁc experimental question.
In earlier years, experiments were often done by single scientists; now it
is more and more common that people are working in teams. Also, results of
experiments should be communicated to many people. This calls for a conceptual
basis which is common at least to a culture of scientists. One problem, however, is
that people from different scientiﬁc cultures have difﬁculties with communicating.
They might not have a common language. The ﬁrst purpose of this book is to

develop a scientiﬁc language for achieving knowledge which is a synthesis of
the languages that I have met in the three cultures that have been exposed to
myself: (1) Mathematical statistics; (2) Quantum mechanics; (3) Applied statistics
including simple applications. It is a hope that this investigation may lead to a
deeper understanding of the epistemic process itself. It is also a hope that such an
investigation perhaps may be continued in order to include more scientiﬁc cultures,
say, machine learning and quantum computation.
Since statistical inference is used as a tool in very many experimental studies,
also within physics, it is natural to take this culture as a point of departure. But I
will add some elements which are not very common in the statistical literature:
1. I make explicit that every experimental investigation is made in a context.
2. A transformation group may be added to the statistical model.
3. Model reductions by means of such groups are introduced.
4. In order to address also the physicists, the parameter concept is introduced
through the more general term epistemic conceptual variable (e-variable). Any
variable which can be deﬁned in words by a person or by a group of persons in an
experimental situation is called a conceptual variable. The notion of an e-variable
at the outset includes every conceptual variable involved in an epistemic process,
and an e-variable can also be connected to a single unit (say to a single human
being in a sociological or psychological investigation or to a single particle in
physics). The basic aim of an epistemic process is to gain some knowledge about
the relevant e-variables. It turns out, however, that even in the basic quantum
mechanical situation, the term “e-variable” might in principle from a statistical
point of view be replaced by “parameter.” The problem is that the latter word is
so over-burdened in physics. It is of course important to stress that whenever I
say “e-variable” in connection to an ordinary statistical investigation, this term
can be replaced by “parameter.”
5. To give a conceptual basis for causality theory and ultimately for ﬁnding a
link to quantum theory, I will also introduce inaccessible conceptual variables,
that is, conceptual variables which cannot be estimated or given any value with
arbitrary accuracy in any experiment. Versions of such unobservable variables
can be found in counterfactual situations, but the notion is also relevant, say, in
connection to regression models where the number of variables by necessity is
larger than the number of units. We will see that this notion is crucial in quantum
mechanics, where it can be linked to Niels Bohr’s concept of complementarity.
Also, I have included the recent notion of conﬁdence distributions, in order
to allow both a frequentist and a Bayesian basis for any given experimental
investigation.
This framework as further developed in the present book will lead to a non-formal
way to discuss essential elements of quantum theory, a theme which occupies later
chapters of this book, and is also discussed further in this chapter. The usual basis
for quantum theory as developed by von Neumann (1932) was a great achievement,
and the language that is implied by this basis is used for all further theoretical
developments and for all discussions among physicists. It is a strong intrinsic part

1.1
Introduction

of the quantum mechanical culture, in fact, of the culture shared by the whole
community of modern physicists. But since the traditional language is purely formal
and has little or no intuitive basis for people outside the community of physicists and
mathematicians, it seems to be of some interest to develop an alternative language
for discussing aspects of quantum theory, even if this language in some cases may
be somewhat restricted compared to the ordinary quantum language.
Several recent investigators in quantum foundations have reasoned that quantum
mechanics should be interpreted as an epistemic science. I agree with this. But
I see it as somewhat problematic that this notion of an epistemic science should
be connected to one language in fundamental physics and a completely different
language in the rest of empirical science. One purpose of this book is to argue for
a new language concerning the concept of a quantum state. I will keep the notion
of a quantum state deﬁned as a unit vector (or ray) in a complex Hilbert space. But
in many connections, this notion can be replaced by the following: One poses a
focused question about the system under consideration: “What will be the value of
θ if I measure it?” and obtains a deﬁnite answer: θ = uk. Here θ is an epistemic
conceptual variable (e-variable)/ observable (to be further discussed below), and uk
is one of the values that θ can take. There may be open ends of the present program
as far as quantum physics is concerned, but I will argue that the investigations can
be carried on further along the same lines.
The skeptic might ask: What is the purpose of introducing a new language when
this does not lead to anything new? My ﬁrst answer is that a simple language may be
of importance in communication between people. For those who know this paradox,
it may be that Wigner’s friend is ignorant of the formal language of quantum theory.
Nevertheless, he might have an intuitive feeling of what it means that the spin
component in direction a of a particle is +1, and from this he might be able to
communicate his state notion to Wigner, and the two will then share a common
state for the physical system.
My second answer is that I will show that my program indeed leads to something
essentially new, also within the science of quantum mechanics itself: The Born
formula, which is the basis for all probability calculations in quantum physics, is
taken as an independent axiom in textbooks. I will derive it from a set of intuitive
assumptions. I also have an aim of being able to discuss the problematic questions
connected to Bell’s inequalities by using an epistemic point of departure. Several so-
called paradoxes can be resolved using the language of epistemic processes. Also
questions around the derivation of the Schrödinger equation are discussed.
One purpose of my program is to propose sort of a link between quantum
theory and statistical inference, two cultures which until now have been completely
separated. The study of scientiﬁc cultures is not common. An exception is the
book by Knorr Cetina (1999), where the author describes from the inside epistemic
cultures connected to two empirical groups: High energy physics experimenters at
CERN and molecular biologists at a laboratory. Her arguments strongly depend
upon the notion of knowledge societies. Of course, I agree that the nature of
knowledge is different in different scientiﬁc communities, but it is the process of

4

The Epistemic View upon Science
achieving knowledge that I feel should have something in common, and it is this
process I will focus upon in this book.
As already mentioned, the language for quantum mechanics used in the present
book also implies a particular interpretation of the theory. Nearly since its intro-
duction at the beginning of the previous century, the physical community has
been divided on the question of the interpretation of quantum theory. The entry
“Interpretations of quantum mechanics” in Wikipedia discusses more than 16
interpretations, some very different. This is obviously an unsatisfactory situation.
One aspect of this: On the one hand, many physicists have argued for an ontic
interpretation of the quantum state: It is a real state of nature. But on the other hand
other scientists have argued for an epistemic interpretation of the quantum state: It
only describes an observer’s knowledge of the state of nature. In my opinion, some
sort of a synthesis of the two views is called for. The phenomenon of collapse of the
wave packet during a measurement and paradoxes such as that of the Schrödinger
cat give strong arguments in order that the epistemic view should play an important
part. This in itself calls for a thorough analysis of how the epistemic process can
be, and this is part of the purpose of the present book. The observer and his context
play an important role in this process. By verbal communication and with the help
of time, several observers may develop a common context. The ontic state of a
particular physical system is in this book identiﬁed with the hypothetical state that
all potential perfect observers with a common context of relevance to this physical
systems agree upon.
Recently, several related no-go theorems have appeared in the physical literature
which have been taken as arguments that a pure epistemic view is inconsistent with
the predictions of quantum mechanics. However, these theorems rely on certain
speciﬁc assumptions. In particular, it is taken as a basis that each physical system
has a certain real-world conﬁguration or state of the matter. This may or may not
hold in my epistemic process setting. The epistemic toy model of Spekkens (2007),
which reproduces many aspects of quantum theory, indicates that these assumptions
are not necessarily satisﬁed.
This book is the result of a long process. In Helland (2006) an approach towards
quantum mechanics was made in a leading statistical journal. Part of this approach
is implemented later in the present book. In Helland (2008) an approach was made
in a good physical journal, but again I know now that the reasoning is not complete.
In the book (Helland, 2010) it was attempted to have two cultures in the mind
at the same time. The book contains some relatively deep results in group action
theory and in mathematical statistics, but the attempts made there to prove a link to
quantum theory are too simple. The main limitation of all these three references is
that I there attempted to deduce quantum theory from a version of statistical theory.
In the present book, I just assume that the two theories can be seen to have a common
basis.

Different Views on the Foundation of Quantum
Mechanics
The ordinary textbook formulation of quantum mechanics is very abstract. Its
starting point: “The state of a physical system is a normalized vector in a separable
Hilbert space” has led to an extremely rich theory, a theory which has not been
refuted by any experiment and whose predictions range over an extremely wide
variety of situations. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how this state concept should be
interpreted.
The Wikipedia entry “Interpretations of quantum mechanics” lists more than 16
different interpretations: Copenhagen interpretation, quantum information theories,
relational quantum mechanics, quantum Bayesianism (QBism), many-world inter-
pretation, consistent histories, ensemble or statistical interpretation, De Broglie–
Bohm theory, quantum Darwinism, transactional interpretation, stochastic mechan-
ics, objective collapse theories, many minds interpretation, and so on. Of course,
this is not a satisfactory state of affair.
Many conferences on quantum foundation have been arranged in recent years,
but this has only implied that the number of new interpretations has increased, and
no one of the old have died out. In two of these conferences, a poll among the
participants was carried out (Schlosshauer et al., 2013; Norsen and Nelson, 2013).
The result was an astonishing disagreement on several simple and fundamental
questions. One of these questions was whether quantum theory should be interpreted
as an objective theory of the world (the ontological interpretation) or if it only
expresses our knowledge of the world (the epistemic interpretation). According to
Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, the adjective “epistemic” means “of or pertaining
to knowledge, or the conditions for acquiring it.”
Recently (Fuchs, 2010; Fuchs and Schack, 2011; Fuchs et al., 2013), and others
have argued for various versions of Quantum Bayesianism, a radical interpretation
where the subjective observer plays an important part. See also the philosophical
discussion by Timpson (2008), the popular account in von Baeyer (2013) and the
recent book (von Baeyer, 2016).
QBism is a way of thinking about science quite generally, not just quantum
physics. To cite Mermin (2014):
“QBism maintains that my understanding of the world rests entirely on the
experiences that the world has induced in me throughout the course of my life.
Nothing beyond my personal experience underlies the picture that I have formed of
my own external world.”
But on the other hand:
“Facile charges of solipsism miss the point. My experience of you leads to
hypothesize that you are very much like myself, with your own private experience.”
In the communication between you and me—in general between human beings,
scientists, and others, we need commonly deﬁned concepts. I will come back to this
later in the book.

The Epistemic View upon Science
In a recent article (Mermin, 2019), David Mermin has clariﬁed his views further.
Some citations from that article may also serve to motivate my own position:
“What lacks is any consensus about what one is actually talking about as one
uses quantum mechanics.”
“The absence of conceptual clarity for almost a century suggests that the problem
might lie in some implicit misconceptions about the nature of scientiﬁc explanation
that are deeply held by virtual all physicists, but are rarely explicitly acknowledged.”
“Much of the ambiguity and confusion of quantum mechanics stems from an
almost universal refusal to recognize that individual personal experience is at the
foundation of the story that each of us tells about the world.”
“I build my understanding of the world I live in entirely out of my own private
personal experience.”
and ﬁnally:
“Quantum mechanics is a tool that I use to help me make sense of my personal
world.”
Let the last statement stand for Mermin’s own position, My own strong opinion
is that in order to make sense of one’s personal world, one should not have the need
to rely on a theory based on advanced mathematics. To make sense in this meaning,
it should be enough to be able to ask focused questions to Nature, and to be able
to obtain answers or at least formulate procedure by which one could obtain such
answers. For some deep questions, the last part may be impossible.
But an important point for the last two citations is that Mermin states that “I”
here can be replaced by “you” or “Alice” or “Bob.” We all base our understanding
of the world on the world on our own personal experience.
Unfortunately, Mermin ends up by a complete support of QBism, as introduced
by Chris Fuchs and Rüdinger Schack. I do not follow him here. My view on quantum
theory is a general epistemic one, inspired by, but of course different from, statistics.
Subjective Bayesianism is only one out of several possible foundational views on
statistics, and I think that it should be equally so for quantum theory. I simply do
not base all my actions on subjective bets, like the QBists claim to do.
It is important for me at this point to explain the differences between my views
and the views of the QBists. I follow their philosophy a long way. I do agree
with them that quantum mechanics should have a large subjective element and that
our mind is important. But I do not agree with them that subjective beliefs and
subjective probabilities should be the main basis always. To me, the QM state vector
can express either subjective beliefs or more objective, data-based knowledge. In
this book I am claiming that this aspect of quantum theory is related to statistical
inference theory. And as the reader may know, statistical science may be based upon
subjective Bayesian philosophy, but it can also be based upon other philosophies.
Indeed, the major part of applied statistics in use today is based upon a frequentist
way of thinking. Some people claim that Bayesianism is the only rational way of
thinking. I do not agree with this. Chris Fuchs says at one place that the concept of
Bayesianism is too wide. Again I do not agree. To me, it is too narrow. Subjective
Bayesianism may be one way of thinking. Objective Bayesianism may be another
way in some cases. And more importantly: There are also other ways of thinking.

1.2

I see QBism as a special case of the general epistemic interpretation of quantum
mechanics advocated in this book.
In the book I have a derivation of the Born rule assuming (1) A focused
version of the statistician’s likelihood principle. (2) An assumption of rationality,
as expressed by a Dutch book argument. In (2) I do not necessarily assume that the
experimentalist herself is perfectly rational. She may fail in some of her decisions. I
may only assume that she during her work adheres to some basic principles, and that
these principles can be modeled by assuming a perfectly rational superior being, and
this superior being may be supposed to be a (rational) Bayesian of some kind. (3)
The state of the experimentalist concerning the physical system is based on what I
call a maximally accessible conceptual variable.
To me, the basic concept is neither belief nor knowledge, it is that of decisions.
One can decide to measure the spin of a silver atom in the x-direction or in the
z-direction. As the result of a (precise) measurement, one will get different state
vectors in the two cases. To me it is immaterial in this situation whether this a state
of belief or a state of knowledge (or both). The main thing is that we have decided
upon a measurement direction and then measured.
This book takes as a point of departure that in some sense or other the epistemic
interpretation should be important for issues of the quantum world. The next
question then arises: Can one ﬁnd a new and more intuitive foundation of quantum
theory, a foundation related to the epistemic interpretation? It is my view that such
a foundation ought to have some relation to statistical inference theory, another
scientiﬁc foundation, which gives tools for wide variety of empirical investigations,
and which in its very essence is epistemic. It should also be a kind of decision theory,
related to decisions taken in everyday life. All this is elaborated on in Chap. 4 below.
I know that the goal of the book is ambitious, but like the views of Mermin, it
is based on my own personal experience, obtained by reading articles on quantum
foundation, reading this as an outsider, in this case a statistician.
Since the classical Copenhagen interpretation, which can be made precise in
slightly different ways, several groups of researchers have proposed different
interpretations of quantum mechanics. An extreme view on this was recently given
by Tammaro (2014), who claimed that all these interpretations were deﬁcient.
More precisely, Tammaro stated that no current interpretation was consistent with
experiment, resolved the measurement problem, and was completely free from
logical deﬁciencies or ﬁne-tuning problems.
Central to this discussion was the measurement problem, in particular the
reconciliation of the two possible modes of change that the wave function can take:
(1) Discontinuous, indeterministic time evolution sending |ψ⟩into an eigenstate
|oi⟩of observable O as a result of measurement of O. (2) Unitary time evolution
governed by the Schrödinger equation.
Tammaro claimed to demonstrate that these two processes are inconsistent. His
argument considered the state of the observer plus system after a measurement by
the observer has been made. Process (1) then generates a mixed state, while Process
(2) generates a pure state. One possible view is as follows: That this represents
an inconsistency, may be related to the assumption that this quantum state really

8
1
The Epistemic View upon Science
represents some objective reality for the system plus observer. According to QBism,
a quantum state is always connected to some agent, and at each time it represents
the subjective reality of that agent. In particular, the above system plus observer may
be observed by another agent, and the wave function of this “Wigner” (relative to
the ﬁrst agent, “Wigner’s friend”) at time t may represent the belief or knowledge
that he has at time t. This may depend upon how he obtains knowledge about the
system, the agent, and the system plus agent.
Discussions in the literature of the EPR paradox (Einstein et al., 1935) and
of Bell’s theorem (Bell, 1987), usually end up with the statement that quantum
mechanics must violate the assumption of local realism. Since the locality assump-
tion is inherent in relativity theory, my view is that it is the assumption of realism
which must be discussed further. The quantum state represents the subjective reality
of an agent or by a group of communicating agents, and this is in principle all there
is to it. When all real and imagined agents agree on some observation at time t, this
may be regarded as an objective reality at time t.
This is a rather radical view upon what reality should mean to us, but it is not
inconsistent with the fact that people in complex macroscopic situations also may
have different world views, and that these different world views may be extremely
difﬁcult to reconcile. This analogy should not be taken too far, though. The QBism
interpretation of quantum mechanics is still only held by a minority of physicists.
To repeat: My own views on quantum mechanics follow the views of the QBists
a long way, but I differ in two respects: (1) For the purpose of a given experiment,
the single observer can be replaced by a group of communicating observers. Thus
language and the forming of concepts are important issues. (2) As formulated
originally, QBism was closely tied to the philosophy of Bayesianism. I want to look
upon the inference from observation in physics as related to inference in statistics,
and I want to allow also other philosophies behind statistical inference. The perfect
observer might well be a Bayesian, but since we humans are imperfect, we must
also be allowed to use frequentist methods.
In any case, both the QBists and I agree that epistemic processes are of
importance in the understanding of quantum mechanics. The simplest epistemic
process consists of at least two decisions by the relevant agent (or communicating
agents): First a decision on what question to nature to focus upon. Then the
experiment or collection of data itself. Then ﬁnally a decision on how to deduce
from these data the answer to the question originally posed.
Statistical theory and practice are almost solely concentrated on the last decision
here. The decisions connected to focusing are attempted included in the present
book.
An interesting discussion of various interpretations of quantum mechanics can be
found in Khrennikov (2014). Khrennikov (2016) discusses QBism from the point of
view of general decision making.

1.3
Theory of Decisions, Focusing, and Context
Classical decision theory has been used with great success in a variety of ﬁelds like
economics, medicine, and politics. It is the basis for much of statistical inference
theory. Yukalov and Sornette (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014) have in a series of
papers tried to challenge this tradition with their Quantum Decision Theory (QDT).
QDT is based upon the formalism of separable Hilbert spaces. It is parallel to
quantum theory in many respects, but this does not imply the decision maker is
a quantum object. QDT is a way to avoid dealing with hidden variables, but at the
same time reﬂecting the complexity of nature. The authors demonstrate that several
paradoxes of classical decision theory can be resolved within QDT, and they claim
that QDT covers both conscious and unconscious decisions.
This is not a place to describe QDT in detail, but the main idea is a mindspace
M spanned by states corresponding to elementary prospects en. These elementary
prospects are intersections of intended actions. Both prospect states |πj⟩, describing
possible future actions, and strategic states |ψs(t)⟩, describing the actor at time t,
are vectors in M . Prospect probabilities are given as p(πj) = |⟨πj|ψs(t)⟩|2, and
rational decision makers maximize these probabilities.
QDT is presented as a formalism by Yukalov and Sornette, but there is also
some discussion in the articles cited above of possible intuitive reasons behind this
formalism. It is interesting in this connection that there is a large recent literature on
various quantum models in psychology and cognitive science in books and articles;
see Khrennikov (2010); Busemeyer and Bruza (2012); Bagarello (2013); Haven and
Khrennikov (2013); Yukalov and Sornette (2009); Sornette (2014); Ashtiani and
Azgomi (2015); Haven and Khennikov (2016), and in particular the review and
discussion article (Pothos and Busemeyer, 2013).
Other approaches to decision making using quantum theory methods are Aerts
et al. (2014) and Eichberger and Pirner (2017).
It is clear that decisions can be made by single actors or by groups of
communicating actors. Therefore, language and a common set of concepts must
be of some importance in a theory of decisions. In some cases, decision making
may take time; in other cases one does not have so long time in making decisions.
Decisions may take into account selected experiences with past events, and may
have a view towards future events. All decisions are made in a context. This context
may be physical, historical, conceptual, or constituting properties of the decision
makers themselves. In particular, all these considerations are relevant for decisions
made under an epistemic process.
1.4
The PBR Theorem: A Toy Model
Recently, (Pusey et al., 2012) proved that the wave function must be ontic (i.e. a
state of reality) in a broad class of realistic approaches to quantum theory. Two
assumptions are made in that paper: (1) A system has a real physical state, not

10
1
The Epistemic View upon Science
necessarily completely described by quantum theory, but objective and independent
of the observer. (2) Systems that are prepared independently have independent
physical states.
The assumption (1) goes to the roots of the traditional physicist’s world view.
I will claim that this state concept is unclear to many people outside the physical
community. Why should one always be able to talk about a state independent of
the observer? Of course, the world itself exists independent of any observer, but the
state of the world, what is that? As is discussed in Chap. 7 below, different people
experience the world differently, also in macroscopic cases.
The Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph (PBR) theorem, related theorems, and argu-
ments connected to the theorem have been thoroughly reviewed by Leifer (2014).
In particular, it is discussed in detail there what is meant by a realistic approach. It
is admitted that there are views of quantum mechanics that are not realistic, and that
the Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph theorem does not apply to such interpretations. The
approach discussed in the present book belongs to this class, broadly characterized
in Leifer (2014) as neo-Copenhagen views. A recent argument against a realistic
interpretation of the wave function is given by Rovelli (2016). A new criticism of the
PBR theorem, discussing the ontological models framework, is given in Charrakh
(2017).
The different interpretations of quantum theory were recently attempted classi-
ﬁed by Cabello (2015). First, the interpretations were divided into two types: Type
I (intrinsic realism) and Type II (participatory realism). For further discussion of
the concept of participatory realism, see Fuchs (2016). The Type II interpretations
were further divided into those concerned about knowledge and the one concerned
about belief (QBism). As will become clear, this book is mainly concentrating on
Type II interpretations concerned about knowledge. According to Cabello (2015),
this includes among others the classical Copenhagen interpretation, the approach
by Zeilinger (1999) and even the no “interpretation” approach by Fuchs and Peres
(2000).
As a possible motivation behind epistemic views of quantum mechanics, the
toy model of Spekkens (2007) is based on a principle that restricts the amount
of knowledge an observer can have about reality. A wide variety of quantum
phenomena were found to have analogues within this toy theory, and this can be
taken as an argument in favor of the epistemic view of quantum states.
In the simplest version of the toy model, we have one elementary system. This
system can be in one of the four ontic states 1, 2, 3, or 4, but our knowledge of this is
in principle restricted. We can only know one of the following six epistemic states:
(a) The ontic state is 1 or 2; (b) it is 3 or 4; (c) it is 1 or 3; (d) it is 2 or 4; (e) it is 1
or 4; or (f) it is 2 or 3. These are the epistemic states of maximal knowledge.
The ontic base of the state (a) is {1, 2}, etc. If the intersection of the ontic bases
of a pair of epistemic states is empty, then those states are said to be disjoint. Thus
(a) and (b) are disjoint, (c) and (d) are disjoint, and (e) and (f) are disjoint. There is a
correspondence with certain basis vectors of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert
space, where disjointness corresponds to orthogonality in the Hilbert space. For
those who knows the Bloch sphere representation of that Hilbert space, the pairs

1.5
Epistemic Processes
11
of disjoint epistemic states can be pictured on the intersections of three orthogonal
axes with that sphere.
Transformations of the epistemic states correspond to permutations of the
ontic state. Thus the underlying group is the permutation group of four symbols,
which has 24 elements. Each permutation induces a map between the epistemic
states. In the Hilbert space correspondence, the even permutations correspond
to unitary transformations, and the odd permutations correspond to antiunitary
transformations.
The toy model of Spekkens (2007) is generalized in several directions in
Spekkens (2014). The generalizations are called epirestricted theories, and are
shown to be equivalent to subtheories of quantum mechanics. An epirestricted
theory consists of 3 steps. One starts with a classical ontological theory. Then
one constructs a statistical theory over these ontic states. Finally one postulates
a restriction on what sorts of statistical distributions that can describe an agent’s
knowledge of the system. The theory of the present book is related both to this and
to the QBism school, but there are important differences, as will be seen from the
discussion below.
1.5
Epistemic Processes
The Quantum Bayesianism is founded on an observer’s belief, quantiﬁed by a
Bayesian probability. I want to relate my state concept also to the notion of certain
belief, which I call knowledge. The knowledge will be associated with an agent
or with a group of communicating agents, and his/her/their knowledge will be
knowledge about what I will call an e-variable.
An epistemic process is any process under which an agent or a group of
communicating agents obtain knowledge about a physical system. In general there
are many ways by which one can obtain knowledge about the world or about aspects
of the world. In a given situation the observer has some background, in terms of his
history, in terms of his physical environment, and in terms of the concepts that he is
able to use in analyzing the situation. This is called the context of the observer, and
the context may limit his ability to obtain knowledge.
A conceptual variable is any variable related to the physical system, deﬁned by
an agent or by a group of communicating agents. The variable may be a scalar, a
vector, or belong to a larger space.
An e-variable or epistemic conceptual variable θ is a conceptual variable
associated with an epistemic process: Before the process the agent (or agents) has
(have) no knowledge about θ; after the process she/they has/have some knowledge,
in the simplest case full knowledge: θ = uk. Here uk is one of the possible values
that θ can take. In parts of this book it is assumed for simplicity that θ is discrete,
which it will be in the elementary quantum setting below. For a continuous variable
θ, knowledge on the e-variable will be taken to mean a statement to the effect that θ
belongs to some given set, an interval if θ is a scalar.

12
1
The Epistemic View upon Science
The e-variable concept is a generalization of the parameter concept as used in
statistical inference, introduced by Fisher (1922), and today incorporated in nearly
all applications of statistics. In statistics, a parameter θ is usually an index in the
statistical model for the observations, and the purpose of an empirical investigation
is to obtain statements about θ, in terms of point estimation, conﬁdence interval
estimation, or conclusion from the testing of hypotheses. The parameter is often
associated with a hypothetical inﬁnite population. My e-variable will also be
allowed to be associated with a ﬁnite physical system, a particle, or a set of particles.
But, in the same way as with a parameter, the purpose of any empirical investigation
will be to try to conclude with some statement, a statement expressed in terms of an
e-variable θ.
1.5.1
E-variables in Simple Epistemic Questions
The point of departure is that we ask a question to nature, a question in order to
achieve increased knowledge. The e-variable is the particular conceptual variable
that is connected to such a question.
To give a very simple example, let us assume that we are given some object
A, and ask “What is the weight of object A?”. Then μ =‘weight of A’ is an e-
variable. We can use a scale to obtain a very accurate estimate of μ. Or we can use
several independent measurements, and use the mean of those as a more accurate
estimate. In the latter case, it is common to introduce a statistical model where
μ is a parameter of that model. But in my view, the e-variable concept is a more
fundamental notion. The variable μ exists before any statistical model is introduced.
Most people will agree that μ exists in some sense. Thus in this example the e-
variable has some ontic basis, but my claim is that this need not always be the case
in all epistemic processes. Even in this case the existence of μ as a real number
may be discussed. For instance, the question “Is μ rational or irrational?” is rather
meaningless.
In some cases, we can obtain very precise knowledge about some e-variable after
some time. As an example, assume that we ask on some Saturday: “What will be
the number of sun hours on Sunday?” To answer this question then, we might need
huge computer models and/or expert advice from meteorologists. Tomorrow, it is
just a question about counting the sun hours.
Similar situations occur when doing simple causal inference. We may for
instance ask “What is the causal effect of medicine C on individual A?”. The e-
variable we might have in mind, might be “Time to recovery for A with medicine C”
compared to time to recovery without any medicine. If we have no earlier experience
with A having the disease in question, we have a counterfactual situation. If we have
observed A earlier with the same disease when he did not take any medicine, we can
at least have a tentative answer within a few days.

E-variables in Statistics
The most important kinds of e-variables in statistics are statistical parameters. The
concept of a statistical parameter was ﬁrst used in its modern context by Fisher
(1922), and is today used in nearly all cases where statistical inference is applied.
A statistical model is a probability model of the data given the parameters, and
the purpose of inference is to obtain information about the parameters. Sometimes
only a subset of the parameters are of interest, and the epistemic question is then
“What are the values of these parameters?” Usually one will not be able to get
complete information. Partial information, given the data, can be expressed in terms
of conﬁdence regions of credibility regions, concepts that will be discussed later in
this book.
A completely different kind of e-variables—here called simple e-variables—
occurs in prediction problems. When we want to predict a random variable Y, the
epistemic question is again “What is the value of Y?” The answer is often sought
via a statistical model by ﬁrst estimating the parameters of the model, and then
formulating a prediction equation from this. This gives a predicted value Y, again
incomplete information from the data. But prediction problems can also be seen as
of different nature than estimation problems, requiring separate techniques.
1.5.3
E-variables in Causal Inference
A causal model is different from a statistical model, as stressed by Pearl (2009).
Statistical concepts are correlation, regression, conditional independence, associa-
tion, likelihood etc., all concepts that can be related to a statistical model. Causal
concepts are randomization, inﬂuence, effect, confounding, etc. A causal model is
deﬁned in terms of what is called a directed acyclic graph, and again these models
contain parameters. The epistemic question is again “What is the value of these
parameters?” Sometimes, but not always, uncertain answers can be given by means
of data.
Simple e-variable also occur in causal inference. Again we can look at the
example “What is the causal effect of medicine C on individual A?”, and the e-
variable might be “Time to recovery for A.”
1.5.4
E-variables in Quantum Mechanics
E-variables as statistical parameters connected to an inﬁnite population may also
occur in quantum mechanics. An example is given in Wootters (1980). Consider
a photon which has just emerged from a polarizing ﬁlter and which is about to
encounter a Nicol prism. The ﬁlter can have a continuum of possible orientations,

14

The Epistemic View upon Science
each characterized by a polarization angle θ. But when the photon encounters the
Nicol prism, it is required to choose between exactly two possible actions: (1) to
go straight through the Nicol prism, or (2) to be deﬂected in a direction uniquely
determined by the orientation of the prism. A straightforward epistemic problem is
to estimate θ from an ensemble of photons using the probability law p(θ) = cos2θ.
Wootters was investigating the much deeper problem whether this probability law
is the best possible in some sense.
But in quantum mechanics, simple e-variables are most important. A quantum
system can be given some preparation, and under this preparation e-variables like
position, momentum, energy, spin, angular momentum may be investigated. The
quantum formulation is introduced by associating each simple e-variable to a self-
adjoint operator in a Hilbert space. In the present book, I will for some parts
concentrate on discrete e-variables. The quantum states are then given by vectors
in the basic Hilbert space, but here special emphasis is given to state vectors that
are eigenvectors of some self-adjoint operator. Given a quantum system and an e-
variable for this system, a natural focused question will be “What is the value of this
e-variable?”, and a simple (perfect) measurement will give the answer. This is my
basis for the developments leading to the quantum formulation in Chap. 4. But the
epistemic question can also be to predict the e-variable before the measurement is
done. Then an incomplete answer can be given, the probability distribution as found
from the Born rule.
Many books and papers use the term “observable” for what I have called a
simple e-variable in quantum mechanics. Ballentine (1998), remarking on some
ambiguity in the use of this term, prefers to use “dynamical variable.” Bell (1975)
introduced the term “beable” for a related concept, assuming some sort of reality of
the dynamical variables. My own point is basically to relate the e-variable concept
closely to an epistemic process.
The ﬁrst basic postulate of the quantum formalism may now be written:
Postulate 1 To each physical system there corresponds a Hilbert space. To each
simple e-variable of this physical system there corresponds a unique self-adjoint
operator of the Hilbert space. For a discrete e-variable the possible values of this
e-variable are the eigenvalues of the operator.
There are several recent attempts to motivate this postulate from more intuitive
assumptions, see references later. My own approach, starting from group actions on
conceptual variables, is contained in Chap. 4 below.
1.5.5
Real and Perfect Measurements in Quantum Mechanics
As emphasized by Ballentine (1998), it is important to distinguish between prepa-
ration and measurement of a physical system. In my notation from Chap. 3, the
preparation gives part of the context τ for the measurement. The purpose of the
measurement is to say something about an e-variable θa.

1.5
Epistemic Processes
15
To be concrete, let us assume that we want to measure the z-component θz of the
spin of a silver atom. (A similar experiment with a charged particle like electron
will lead to practical difﬁculties due to the so-called Lorentz force acting upon
the charge.) The spin component takes one of two possible values, say ±1. The
experiment is done by sending the atom in some direction, say the y-direction,
through a magnetic ﬁeld which is inhomogeneous in the z-direction. This will cause
the atom to be deﬂected up in the z-direction if θz = +1, down if θz = −1.
How should this deﬂection be detected? One way would be to place a screen
of detectors in the xz-plane after the silver atom has passed the magnetic ﬁeld.
Hopefully this will give a click in one detector in the positive z-direction if θz = +1,
or one in the negative z-direction if θz = −1.
But such detectors are far from perfect. It may be that the silver atom goes
through the screen without being detected. It may be that it clicks on two or more
neighboring detectors when passing through the screen. What we have as a result
of the experiment is data, which is an array of 0’s and 1’s corresponding to the
detectors: 1 if the detector clicks, 0 otherwise.
This kind of detection errors may seem like a nuisance, but they have funda-
mental physical importance. Similar detection errors have played a large role in the
physical literature on Bell’s inequality, which will be brieﬂy discussed in Chap. 5.
The point here is that one on the background of such detection errors have proposed
possible “loopholes” in quantum mechanical experiments to test Bell’s theorem.
Very recent experiments have excluded such loopholes.
Another point about this simple experiment is the following: The same magnet
and screen of detectors can be rotated so as to measure spin component θa in any
direction a, and the same probability model can be used for the measurement. Thus
there is strictly speaking no reason to use a superscript a on the data Za of the
experiment, but we will do it anyway to make it clear that this is the data for the
experiment for the spin e-variable θa in the direction a.
Thus we have data Za, and we may construct a statistical model for these data, a
model depending on the true value of θa. The details of this model need not concern
us now, but my important point is that we are in the generalized experiment situation
discussed in detail in Sect. 3.2. The distribution of Za, given the context τ, depends
on the unknown e-variable θa, and relative to this distribution, τ is independent of
θa. (A prior for θa may depend upon τ, however.)
So far, we have had only one particle, but a similar construction applies in
the situation with a beam of n independent particles. Then, depending upon the
situation, we may have a single e-variable θa or we may have a set of e-variables
θa = (θa
1 , θa
2 , . . . , θa
n) with data Za = (Za
1, Za
2, . . . , Za
n). In the case of a single
e-variable, when n →∞, the frequency distribution from the data approaches
a probability distribution over the e-variable, and the data may without loss of
generality be reduced to such a frequency distribution of clicks over the detectors of
the screen. Under suitable assumptions, the probability distribution of the e-variable
is given by the Born rule derived in Chap. 5, and the data reduction corresponds to
a reduction by sufﬁciency, a concept discussed in Chap.3.

16
1
The Epistemic View upon Science
In Chap. 3 three fundamental principles of statistical inference are discussed,
the conditionality principle, the sufﬁciency principle, and the likelihood principle,
where the last one is shown to follow from the ﬁrst two principles. This whole
apparatus is now available for experiments of the quantum type. I will in fact use
the likelihood principle later when deriving Born’s rule, the basic probability rule
of quantum theory. It is therefore important to me that a similar discussion with an
imperfect apparatus in principle can be carried out in all quantum experiments. But
this is in principle. Once the statistical principles are established, we can concentrate
on perfect experiments where data are in one-to-one correspondence with the e-
variables of the experiment.
The same kind of data and data model can be used for any choice of focused
direction, focused measurement. Assume that the situation is such that the vector
of different e-variables θa is inaccessible; see Sect. 1.5.8. Then this gives rise to a
focused version of the likelihood principle. This is the kind of likelihood principle
used to derive the Born rule. The details are in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5.
1.5.6
Quantum States, Their Interpretations, and a Link
to the Ensemble Interpretation
Pure quantum states are deﬁned formally as unit vectors in the Hilbert space.
These vectors may or may not be eigenvectors of physical meaningful self-adjoint
operators. They are denoted as ket vectors |k⟩and may be assumed to form a
complete set. For more information, see Sect. 5.1 and Appendix B.
Let ﬁrst |k⟩be a unit eigenvector of a self-adjoint operator A corresponding
to a simple e-variable θ. Assume for simplicity that A does not have multiple
eigenvalues. Then, from an epistemic process point of view, and from what can
be seen as a simple observation from the quantum formalism, |k⟩may be identiﬁed
by a question “What is the value of θ?” together with a deﬁnite answer “θ = uk,”
where uk is the corresponding eigenvalue.
Given a unit vector |k⟩, there will in general be an inﬁnity of self-adjoint
operators for which |k⟩is an eigenvector, and a priori there may be more than one
operator which correspond to physically meaningful e-variables θ. Also, one must
consider the case with multiple eigenvalues. Hence, given |k⟩, its association to a
question-and-answer pair may not be unique in general. In the special case of the
spin of an electron, and by taking a ﬁxed question-and-answer pair for a maximally
accessible e-variable as a point of departure, there is deﬁnitely some uniqueness,
however.
(a) For a spin 1/2 particle, or more generally for a qubit, a unit vector in a 2-
dimensional Hilbert space, there is a unique question-and-answer pair for spin
component corresponding to each unit vector; see Proposition 4.3 of Chap. 4.
(b) In a general setting one can prove from my approach towards the quantum
formalism that from a pair of maximally accessible conceptual variables one

1.5
Epistemic Processes
17
can construct a Hilbert space, and each question-and-answer pair associated
with such a maximally accessible e-variable taking a ﬁnite number of values,
corresponds to some normalized vector of this Hilbert space, see Proposition 4.1
of Chap.4.
In the general case of multiple eigenvalues of the relevant operator, the question-
and-answer pairs may be seen to correspond to the eigenspaces of the operator.
A larger class of pure states than those which a priori may be seen as corre-
sponding to question-and-answer pairs for some set of e-variables may be found by
taking linear combinations, which may be motivated physically, or as solutions of
the Schrödinger equation.
In most of this book I will discuss epistemic processes, processes to obtain
knowledge about some system, physical or otherwise. Then the question-and-
answer pair corresponds to two decisions: First a decision on which e-variable to
focus upon. Then after the data are obtained, a decision on the value of this e-
variable. In statistical theory, only the last of these decisions is discussed. It is very
interesting that the quantum state concept turns out to be useful for more general
decisions; see the literature on quantum decision theory and on quantum theory
used in cognitive models.
To the ket vector |k⟩corresponds the bra vector ⟨k| and the projection operator
|k⟩⟨k|.
The more general concept of a mixed state is deﬁned from a probability
distribution {πk} as follows:
ρ =

k
πk|k⟩⟨k|.
(1.1)
Depending upon the observator(s) and upon the physical situation, the proba-
bilities πk may be interpreted—and assessed/ estimated—in three possible ways:
(1) as Bayesian prior distributions; (2) as Bayesian posterior distributions; (3)
as frequentist conﬁdence distributions, see Schweder and Hjort (2016). From a
statistical point of view, Bayesian probabilities are connected to credibility intervals,
conﬁdence distributions are derived from conﬁdence intervals; see Chap. 2 below.
It is interesting that under speciﬁc symmetry assumptions, the conﬁdence intervals
and the credibility intervals coincide and are associated with the same probability;
see Corollary 3.6.2 p. 93 in Helland (2010). A consequence of this is that the
probabilities estimated under the interpretations (2) and (3) will be numerically
equivalent under these symmetry assumptions.
In this section it will be convenient to use the conﬁdence distribution interpre-
tation (3), even though it is new and unknown, also largely among statisticians.
The basic concept is that of a conﬁdence interval with some variable conﬁdence
coefﬁcient; details will be discussed in Chaps. 2 and 6. The important point to us
now is the interpretation of the conﬁdence coefﬁcient. It can be seen as a limiting
frequency obtained from data in a large hypothetical set of epistemic processes
where the same statistical method is used.

18
1
The Epistemic View upon Science
A similar idea carries over to the quantum situation: Ballentine (1998) makes
an important point of the fact that probabilities in quantum mechanics must be
interpreted with respect to a hypothetical ensemble. In Smolin (2011) it is proposed
that this hypothetical ensemble is realized by all systems in the universe that occupy
the same quantum state.
The state concept is the basis for all calculation of probabilities in quantum
mechanics. A physical system is prepared in some given state, and probability
distributions of measurements from this state are given by the Born rule.
The Born rule is developed from my point of view in Chap. 5. A consequence of
this rule is a simple formula which can be used to restate Ballentine’s.
Postulate 2 To each state there corresponds a unique state operator ρ. The average
value of an e-variable θ, represented by the operator A, in the virtual ensemble of
events that may result from a preparation procedure for state represented by the
operator ρ is
⟨θ⟩= tr(ρA).
From a statistical point of view, the average value here is interpreted as an
expectation. By extending this formula in a natural way, the probability distribution
of θ under ρ may be derived; see again (Ballentine, 1998). In fact this probability
distribution follows easily directly from my version of the Born rule.
1.5.7
Quantum States for Spin 1/2 Particles
Consider again the silver atom of Sect. 5.5, and suppose that we want to measure
the spin component in some direction a. Let us now assume that the measurement
apparatus is perfect. Then the experiment has two possible outcomes: spin up or
spin down. This corresponds to two possible quantum states:
|a; +⟩or |a; −⟩.
(1.2)
Let now a be arbitrary. In Chap. 4 I will prove the important result: All pure quantum
states for spin 1/2 particles can be written in one of the forms (1.2) for some a.
In concrete terms, this means that every pure quantum state for a spin 1/2 particle
can be interpreted as a question: What is the spin component in direction a? together
with a crisp answer: +1 or −1. (Strictly speaking, this gives a double counting
of quantum states, since, given some direction a, we can also choose the opposite
direction −a, and θa = +1, say, is equivalent to θ−a = −θa = −1.)
For a system of N spin 1/2 particles, one can consider a set of questions of this
kind, one for each particle. Recently (Hohn and Wever, 2017) proved by a detailed
argument that the states of such a system are equivalent such a set of questions
together with sharp answers to these questions.

1.5
Epistemic Processes
19
In general, a set of questions can also be seen as a single question, where the
relevant e-variable is a vector.
It is of some related interest that the axioms of quantum mechanics recently were
approached by Smilga (2017) by taking spin measurements in different directions
as a point of departure, and using group representation theory. A general version of
such an argument will be given in Chap. 4.
1.5.8
Inaccessible Conceptual Variables and Complementarity
It is important that not all conceptual variables are e-variables. A conceptual
variable φ is called inaccessible if there is no epistemic process by which one
can get accurate knowledge about it. An example from the area of quantum
mechanics is φ = (ξ, π), where ξ is the position of a particle, and π is the
momentum. An example which will be discussed throughout the present book is
φ = (λx, λy, λz), where λa is the component of an angular momentum or a spin for
a particle or a system of particles, the component in direction a. Here each λa is an
accessible conceptual variable, an e-variable, but the vector φ is inaccessible. Also
macroscopic examples abound, for instance connected to counterfactual situations
in causal inference: Let θ1 be the time to recovery for given patient A when he
is given treatment B, let θ2 be his time to recovery when he can only be given
treatment C, and let φ = (θ1, θ2).
In such cases, where a vector of e-variables is inaccessible, it is equivalent to
say that the components are complementary. Since introduced by Bohr, the concept
of complementarity has played a fundamental and important role in quantum
mechanics.
It is essential to stress that the conceptual variables above are not hidden
variables. Variables like φ are just mathematical variables, but variables upon
which group actions may be deﬁned. φ = (ξ, π) may be subject to Galilean
transformations, time translations, or changes of units, while φ = (λx, λy, λz) may
be subject to rotations.
The (simple) e-variables are not hidden variables, but closely tied to the epistemic
processes.
To illustrate the general view of this book, look at Fig. 1.1. Here φ is an inaccessi-
ble conceptual variable, the θ’s are e-variables, the τ’s are context variables, and the
z’s are data. The upper arrows denote functional dependence, and the lower arrows
denote conditional probability distributions of the data. The dotted arrows indicate
that one may or may not have a prior for θ, given the context. The experimentalist
has the choice between two mutually excluding experiments, denoted by a and b.
When does this situation lead to a quantum theory, which can alternatively be
described by a Hilbert space formulation? A general answer in terms of sufﬁcient
conditions is given in Chap. 4. One can ﬁrst assume that the θ’s are discrete, which
they are in elementary quantum theory, but we can also let the same ﬁgure illustrate

a setting where the θ’s are continuous; for a completely general formulation, see the
end of Chap. 5 or the beginning of Chap. 6.
The inference on simple e-variables as presented in this book implies some
connection between the quantum mechanical culture and the statistical culture. In
the next chapter, I will give a broad description of the science of statistical inference.
Then I will give some general principles on inference on parameters/ e-variables
when data are involved, and after that I will turn to quantum theory.
1.6
Quantum Theory, the Mind, and the Mathematics
In his popular article on QBism, (von Baeyer, 2013) used the heading “It’s all in your
mind.” My e-variables must in general be connected to the mind of an observer or to
the minds of several communicating observers. But there is no mystery behind this.
The parameters of a statistical model must be connected to the mind of a statistician
or a scientist. The weight of an object before one measures it may be connected
to the real world, but it is also in some connection to the mind of the person
performing the measurement. In many quantum settings, such a double connection
is also relevant, but in some special situations, like the EPR experiment and the Bell
experiment, to be discussed in Chaps. 4 and 5, it seems in my opinion that the e-
variables’ connection to a reality lying behind the experiment, must be tuned down.
In this book, it is the experiments or measurements, and the e-variables’ connection
to these experiments, that form the main conceptual bases. This lies already in the
title “Epistemic Processes.”
Mathematically, this book is based upon group theory and group representation
theory. I could perhaps have tried to go deeper into the mathematics, but this would
have been beyond my present competence, and I think also that one would have lost
a little clarity if one had tried to go essentially deeper into the mathematics behind
the discussion here. But note that (McCullagh, 2002) based his treatment of the
foundation of statistical models on category theory.

Convivial Solipsism
A new philosophy which may help to understand the basis of quantum mechanics,
a philosophy which also may be linked to my own ideas, was recently proposed by
Zwirn (2016, 2020).
In general, solipsism is a philosophy with many variants. It is based upon the view
that everything that we can know for sure by our mind is connected to this mind.
My mind is an autonomous separate world. The convivial variant also recognizes
that other people have their minds and thus have sure statements connected to their
minds. And communication between different people is possible. People that have
communicated and agree on certain questions may be seen as a new unit, a new
world, with respect to these questions. In a macroscopic context this may be linked
to a theory of making decisions, as discussed above.
In our microscopic setting, Zwirn discusses his philosophy in detail. For each
observer, convivial solipsism is built upon two assumptions: (1) The quantum states
that are meaningful to the observer are relative, not absolute. This assumption
goes back to the writings of Everett (1957), and can also be found in the QBism
interpretation (Fuchs, 2010) and in Rovelli (1996)’s relational quantum mechanics.
(2) There is no measurement until the result of the measurement is perceived in the
consciousness of an observer, and for this result there is a hanging-up mechanism:
All subsequent measurements, decisions, and actions must be seen from the basis of
this result.
Experiments to measure an e-variable θ are mostly seen as perfect in the quantum
mechanical literature, measurement apparata are seen as completely accurate.
In practice, the apparata give data X which are inaccurately related to θ, and
this inaccuracy may be modeled by a statistical model p(X|θ). The observer/
experimentalist may then give an estimate θ from the data X. From the point of
view of convivial solipsism, this estimate may be seen as the result of measurement
perceived by the consciousness of the observer, taken with respect to following
experiments as the true resulting value of θ if the current experiment is accurate
enough. When the result of the experiment is discrete, as it is in elementary quantum
mechanics, it is often not problematic to regard the estimate from the data as the true
value if the experiment is accurate enough.
A further discussion of convivial solipsism will be given in Chap.4 and in
Chap. 7.

Chapter 2
Statistical Inference
Abstract A summary of statistical inference theory as it has been developed up
to now, is given. Both frequentist and Bayesian inference are covered. The recent
concept of conﬁdence distributions is described. As a preparation for the next
chapter, statistical inference is also seen as a special case of inference in a general
epistemic process.

2.1.1
Probability
The concept of probability is basic for statistical theory. As developed by
Kolmogorov in 1930, it is taken as a normed measure on some probability space 
.
Formally, we ﬁrst introduce a σ-algebra F of subsets of 
. The mathematical
requirements are: (a) 
 should be in F; (b) the complement Ac should be in F
whenever A is in F, where Ac = {ω ∈
 : ω /∈A}; (c) ∪∞
n=1An should be in F
whenever An is in F for n = 1, 2, . . ..
A normed measure P is then a set function such that (a) 0 ≤P(A) ≤P(
) = 1
for all A ∈F; (b) P(∪∞
n=1An) = ∞
n=1 P(An) if the sets Ai and Aj are disjoint;
i.e., Ai ∩Aj = ∅when i ̸= j. This implies P(Ac) = 1 −P(A) and P(A ∪B) =
P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B) for all sets A and B. The sets A ∈F are called events,
and the triple (
, F, P) is called a probability space.
If 
 is a topological space, the Borel σ-algebra is the smallest σ-algebra
containing all open sets. If 
 is discrete and ﬁnite, we can, and will, take F to
consist of all subsets.
A random variable X is a measurable function from 
 into the Euclidean space
Rn, that is, a function such that {X ∈B} = {ω ∈
 : X(ω) ∈B} = X−1(B) is in
F whenever B is a Borel set in Rn. The probability distribution of X is deﬁned by
P(X ∈B) = P(X−1(B)).

Statistical Inference
Readers not willing to go into all these mathematical details may think of a
random variable X as some variable with a distribution associated with it. In this
book, I will work with real-valued random variables of two kinds:
•
Discrete ﬁnite-valued random variables X with point probabilities p(i) =
P(X = i); i = 1, . . . , r satisfying r
i=1 p(i) = 1.
•
Continuous random variables X with P(a ≤X ≤b) =
 b
a f (x)dx for some
probability density f (x) satisfying
 ∞
−∞f (x)dx = 1.
From this, we deﬁne expectation
μ = E(X) =
r

i=1
ip(i);
μ = E(X) =
 ∞
−∞
xf (x)dx
E(g(X)) =
r

i=1
g(i)p(i);
E(g(X)) =
 ∞
−∞
g(x)f (x)dx
and variance
σ 2 = Var(X) = E[(X −μ)2].
Two random variables X and Y are independent if P((X ∈A) ∩(Y ∈B)) =
P(X ∈A)P(Y ∈B) for all Borel sets A and B, with a natural generalization
to several random variables. For discrete random variables, this is equivalent to
pX,Y (i, j) = pX(i)pY (j); for continuous random variables it is equivalent to
fX,Y (x, y) = fX(x)fY (y) with an obvious deﬁnition of the joint density.
The interpretation of the probability concept is important for applications. In the
literature, three different, but related interpretations are given:
1. The principle of equally likely outcome: If there are r possible outcomes, each
is given the probability 1/r. This can immediately be applied to discrete ﬁnite-
valued variables, and has examples in the tossing of a die, the tossing of a coin, in
card games, in opinion polls, etc. Below I will generalize the principle to random
variables with a compact range, using the group concept. When the range is not
compact, we need un-normed measures. This causes conceptual difﬁculties that
I will not go too deeply into in the present book. I will return to the problem at
some points, however.
2. The principle of odds making or subjective probability: The probability of an
event A is found on the basis of how much a person is willing to pay for each
outcome in a wager with the two outcomes A and Ac. This was introduced by de
Finetti and Savage, and used by them as a foundation for Bayesian statistics.
3. The principle of long run frequency: If an experiment is repeated n times, the
relative frequency of the event A is the number of times A happens, divided
upon n. The probability of A is interpreted as the limit in some sense (see below)
of the relative frequency as n →∞. I will indicate below that this interpretation

2.1

27
always can be applied, and made precise, in situations where an experiment can
be repeated an arbitrary number of times and the probability can be deﬁned from
other considerations.
In many concrete applications, not only one, but two or three of these interpreta-
tions may be relevant.
The concept of conditional probability can be given a precise mathematical
deﬁnition using the notion of a Radon–Nikodym derivative. Speciﬁcally, if B is
a sub-σ-algebra of F, then we deﬁne P(A|B) as the unique (up to a P-measure 0)
B-measurable function such that

B
P(A|B)P(dω) =

B
IA(ω)P(dω)
(2.1)
for all B ∈B. If B is generated by the disjoint events {Bi}, this is consistent with
the deﬁnition that P(A|Bi) = P(A ∩Bi)/P(Bi) whenever P(Bi) ̸= 0.
Finally, asymptotic considerations may simplify statistics in cases where there
are many observations. I will introduce three limit concepts in probability:
•
Convergence in probability: P(|Yn −Y| > ϵ) →0 for all ϵ > 0.
•
Convergence almost surely: P({ω : Yn(ω) →Y(ω)}) = 1. This is stronger than
convergence in probability.
•
Convergence in law: P(Yn ≤y) →P(Y ≤y) for all y where F(y) = P(Y ≤y)
is continuous. This is a property of the distribution functions rather than of the
random variables, but it is related in several ways to the concept of convergence
in probability. For instance, for convergence to a degenerate distribution, the two
concepts are equivalent, and when Yn tends in law to Y and Un in probability to
c, then Yn + Un tends in law to Y + c.
In statistical applications, we often have repeated observations, and thus a sample
X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xn), where the Xi’s are independent with the same distribution.
Assuming these have ﬁnite expectation μ and ﬁnite variance σ 2, one can prove three
limit laws for the mean ¯Xn = n−1 n
i=1 Xi:
•
The law of large numbers I: ¯Xn converges in probability to μ as n →∞.
•
The law of large numbers II: ¯Xn converges almost surely to μ as n →∞.
•
The central limit theorem: √n( ¯Xn −μ) converges in law to N(0, σ 2), where
N(ξ, σ 2) in general is the continuous distribution with density
f (x) =
1
√
2πσ
exp(−(x −ξ)2
2σ 2
).
(2.2)
For the ﬁrst and the third law, see Lehmann (1999). The second law is proved for
instance in Sen and Singer (1993).
Using the law of large numbers on the indicator functions Xi = I(Zi ∈A), one
easily shows that the frequency interpretation of the probability concept always is
valid in situations where it is applicable.

Statistical Inference
2.1.2
Statistical Models
In general, a model is a representation of the real world, simpliﬁed, but designed
such that the essential features that one is interested in, are focused in the model
and are correctly represented in the model. A map of the London underground is
sometimes taken as an example of a model.
In statistics, one wants a model which can be employed in the epistemic process.
This is the reasoning used: The unknown feature that one is interested in, is modeled
as a parameter θ, real-valued or belonging to a subset of some Euclidean space
Rp. (I will not go into nonparametric statistics in this book.) Giving θ some value
deﬁnes a state of the unknown world. Look at the situation before the experiment
or observational study is done, and choose some potential observations Xi. These
observations are assumed to have a probability distribution for each given state of
the world. The speciﬁcation of this class of probability distributions constitutes the
statistical model. The statistical model should focus on the relationship between
the parameter that one is interested in and the observations to be done, and it should
represent this relationship as well as possible. It should be simple, but not too simple.
The purpose of statistical modeling can be listed as follows:
•
Give a rough description of the data generating process.
•
Provide parameters that can be estimated from data.
•
Allow focusing upon certain parameters.
•
Give a language for asking questions about nature.
•
Give means for answering such questions by estimation or by the testing of
hypotheses.
•
Provide conﬁdence intervals and error estimates.
•
Give a possibility to study deviations from the model and choosing new models.
Thus the model can be seen as part of a language. A model should be chosen
carefully using subject matter knowledge together with a realization of what can be
done statistically. If possible, the model should be scrutinized empirically. But once
the model is chosen, this is an existential choice. Any conclusion is conditional,
given the model.
Speciﬁcally, consider the situation with n repeated, independent observations.
This is modeled by independent, identically distributed random variables
(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) with distribution depending upon some parameter θ,
In the discrete case:
Pθ(X1 = x1, . . . , Xn = xn) = n
k=1pθ(xk).
In the continuous case:
Pθ(X1 ≤x1, . . . , Xn ≤xn) =
 x1
−∞
. . .
 xn

n
k=1fθ(uk)du1 . . . dun.

Basic Statistics

Here pθ(x) is the point probability of the individual observations and fθ(x) is
the probability density of the individual observations. For continuous models, a
very common choice of the probability density fθ(x) is the normal density (2.2).
In some cases, this may be motivated by some form of the central limit theorem; in
other cases it is just a matter of convenience. Here θ = (ξ, σ). One can distinguish
between three cases: (1) σ is known and ξ is the unknown parameter. (2) ξ is known
and σ is the unknown parameter. (3) Both ξ and σ are unknown. The study of
statistical methods that are robust against the assumption of normality, is an active
research area in statistics.
One simple discrete case is when one has n independent repeated trials, each
with two possible outcomes A or Ac, often called success and failure. Assuming the
same probability η of success in each trial, and letting Xk be the indicator of success
in the kth trial, we have the point probabilities pη(0) = 1 −η and pη(1) = η. If
now Y is the number of successes in the n trials, it is a straightforward exercise to
show that Y has a binomial distribution:
Pη(Y = y) =
 n
y

ηy(1 −η)n−y.
The binomial distribution gives E(Y) = nη and Var(Y) = nη(1 −η).
A multivariate generalization is the multinomial distribution: Assume n indepen-
dent trials, each with k possible outcomes A1, . . . , Ak. Let P(Aj) = ηj for each
j in each trial, so that k
j=1 ηj = 1. Let Yj be the number of times that Aj has
occurred in the n trials. Then for k
j=1 yj = n we have
P(Y1 = y1, . . . , Yk = yk) =
n!
y1! · · · yk!ηy1
1 · · · ηyk
k .
Here μj = E(Yj) = nηj, Var(Yj) = nηj(1−ηj) and the covariance Cov(Yi, Yj) =
E(Yi −μi)(Yj −μj) = −nηiηj. This can be summarized in the covariance
matrix C(Y) with Var(Yj) (j = 1, . . . , k) on the diagonal and Cov(Yi, Yj) (i, j =
1, . . . , k) as off-diagonal terms.
Other standard choices of point probabilities and probability densities are listed
in Chapter 1 of Lehmann (1999).
An extensive and deep article arguing for a limitation of the ordinary concept of
a statistical model is McCullagh (2002).
2.1.3
Inference for Continuous Parameters
The modern theory of statistical inference was developed by R.A. Fisher in the
1920s and the 1930s, at the same time as modern quantum theory was developed.
Fisher knew about quantum theory, but did never hint at any relation to it in his own
work.

Statistical Inference
From an epistemic point of view, it is important in statistics to distinguish
between the situation before any observations are done, and after observations are
done. Before, the observations are unknown, but are modeled as stochastic variables
X through the chosen statistical model. After the observations, they are known
values X = x, and we want to use these observations to say something about the
state of nature, the parameters θ. There has to be a recipe from x to the inference
about θ.
The simplest concept is that of point estimation: The parameter θ is estimated
by a function of the data: θ(x). The properties of this estimation procedure are
evaluated by looking at the before-observation situation and using the statistical
model: With the stochastic variable X inserted, θ(X) is called an estimator. One
good property might be that the estimator is unbiased: E(θ(X)) = θ or nearly
so. Another good property is that it has a small variance. These two properties
are sometimes combined in the requirement that the estimator should have a mean
square error which is as small as possible, where
MSE(θ(X)) = E((θ(X) −θ)2) = Var(θ(X)) + (E(θ(X)) −θ)2.
A point estimator is often given together with a standard error: An estimate of
the standard deviation of the corresponding estimator, i.e., the square root of its
variance. The standard error gives an indication of uncertainty of the estimate.
In a typical before-observations situation, one has also the possibility to decide
how much data one should take; this may be indexed by a number n. The simplest,
but not uncommon, case is that of repeated measurements, that is, of n independent,
identically distributed observations Xn = (X1, . . . , Xn), but many more situations
of this kind exist. The before-observation version of the estimation recipe, θ =
θ(Xn) is then the estimator. A weak, but desirable property of the estimator is that
it should be consistent: θ(Xn) should converge in probability or almost surely to
θ as n tends to inﬁnity. A further property which is often satisﬁed by some central
limit type theorem is that of asymptotic normality: Typically √n(θ −θ) converges
in law to N(0, σ 2) for some variance σ 2. It is desirable that σ 2 should be as small
as possible.
In fact these properties are satisﬁed for a large class of situations, explored by
Fisher. In the case of discrete observations, the model implies joint probabilities
for the data pθ(x), in the continuous case joint probability densities fθ(x). In
both cases, when one focuses upon the θ-dependence, this function is called the
likelihood L(θ). Fisher argued that one should maximize the likelihood to ﬁnd good
estimates of θ. The intuitive argument is that this will provide the θ-value which
in a best possible way explains the obtained data. The maximum θ(x) is called
the maximum likelihood estimate. Local extremes can be found by equating the
derivative of the likelihood functions to zero. In more complicated situations, one
may have problems with several local extremes, but often these problems may be
tackled by numerical maximization methods.
Maximum likelihood estimation is used throughout statistics in a large number
of applications to a diverse set of applied sciences.

2.1
Basic Statistics
31
To evaluate the properties of the maximum likelihood procedure, one again
turns to the pre-observation situation. Then θ(X) with the stochastic variable from
the model inserted, is called the maximum likelihood estimator. For simplicity
let us look at the situation with repeated independent continuous observations
Xn = (X1, . . . , Xn). Let fθ(x) be the probability density of a single observation,
and deﬁne the Fisher information by I(θ) = E(( ∂
∂θ lnfθ(x))2) assuming that this
exists. Then under regularity conditions (see for instance (Lehmann, 1999), where
uniqueness of the local extrema is assumed for this), one can prove the following:
(1) θ = θ(Xn) is consistent; (2) √n(θ −θ0) converges in law to N(0, 1/I(θ0))
under θ0, the true value, as n →∞. Thus the maximum likelihood estimator has
some good asymptotic properties, and these results may be generalized to other
cases with a large amount of data. However, there exist many examples of cases
where the maximum likelihood estimator does not behave in an optimal way; see
Le Cam (1990).
A good estimator δ(X) can also be found using a loss function L(δ(X), θ), for
instance quadratic loss L = (δ(X) −θ)2. One objective might be to minimize
the risk, or expected loss, R(δ, θ) = Eθ(L(δ(X), θ)), but a uniform minimization
here is not feasible: Taking δ(X) ≡θ0 gives R(δ, θ0) = 0 for all reasonable
loss functions. One way around this is to limit oneself to unbiased estimators:
Eθ(δ(X)) = θ for all θ. The theory on this can be found in Lehmann and Casella
(1998).
In addition to point estimation, statistical inference theory discusses hypothesis
testing and conﬁdence intervals. Hypothesis testing is closely related to conﬁdence
intervals. I will consider here one-sided conﬁdence intervals (−∞, ¯θ] and two-
sided conﬁdence intervals [θ, ¯θ]. The lower and upper limits of these intervals are
functions of the data. When considered again in the pre-observational situation, they
should have the properties
Pθ(θ ∈(−∞, ¯θ(X)]) = Pθ( ¯θ(X) ≥θ) = γ,
(2.3)
Pθ(θ ∈[θ(X), ¯θ(X)]) = Pθ(θ(X) ≤θ ≤¯θ(X)) = γ,
(2.4)
where γ is a pre-assigned conﬁdence coefﬁcient, say 0.95 or 0.99.
The statistical methods discussed so far are called frequentist methods: They
are coupled to a pre-observational distribution using the statistical model. The
probabilities and expectations involved in this can be interpreted by a thought
construction: Imagine that the whole experiment is repeated a large number of
times. Then the imagined relative frequency of an event A for these repetitions
is approximately equal to the hypothetical probability P(A). The probabilities and
expectations are therefore connected to the methods used and to the statistical model
used.
There is another approach to statistical inference which has a long history, but
has been particularly popular in the last few years: The Bayesian approach. Here
the probabilities are imagined to be connected to the parameters themselves. The
important assumption is that one ﬁrst in some way has obtained a prior distribution

32
2
Statistical Inference
on the parameter, say with a probability density π(θ). From this prior, one ﬁnds a
posterior distribution, given the data, by using a variant of Bayes’ formula
P(T |D) = P(T ∩D)
P(D)
= P(T )P(D|T )
P(D)
.
The ﬁrst part of this formula is the deﬁnition of the conditional probability of some
theory value T , given the data D. This deﬁnition is consistent with the Radon–
Nikodym approach, and also consistent with what one calls conditional probability
in simple examples. The second part of the formula is a consequence. Applied to a
situation with a continuous parameter θ and a continuous data model with density
fθ(x), a formula for the posterior density of θ given the data is obtained:
π(θ|x) = π(θ)fθ(x)
f (x)
=
π(θ)fθ(x)

π(η)fη(x)dη.
Consider ﬁrst Bayesian point estimation. Again deﬁning a loss function
L(δ(x), θ), we can now introduce the Bayesian risk as
BR(δ(x)) =

L(δ(x), θ)π(θ|x)dθ,
and ﬁnd the estimate δ(x) which minimized BR. With quadratic loss this leads to
the posterior mean

θπ(θ|x)dθ as an estimate. Other possible estimates include the
mode and the median of the posterior distribution, the mode being the maximum of
the density and the median is the value such that the probability that the parameter is
below this value, equals 1/2. In these estimates one can insert the pre-observational
stochastic variable X, compare them with estimators obtained by frequentists
methods, evaluating estimators using a frequentist or Bayesian approach.
The Bayesian concept which replaces the conﬁdence intervals is that of credibil-
ity intervals. Again consider the one-sided case (−∞, θ∗(x)] and the two-sided case
[θ∗(x), θ∗(x)]. These intervals have direct interpretations in terms of a probability
distribution over the parameter, the posterior distribution:
P(θ ∈(−∞, θ∗(x)]) =
 θ∗(x)
−∞
π(θ|x)dθ.
P(θ ∈[θ∗(x), θ∗(x)]) =
 θ∗(x)
θ∗(x)
π(θ|x)dθ.
To choose θ∗(x) and θ∗(x), this can again be given a pre-assigned value γ , say 0.95
or 0.99. In a speciﬁc sense, the interpretation of the credibility interval is simpler
and more direct than the interpretation of the conﬁdence interval.
There is much more to say about Bayesian theory and Bayesian methods; see
Bernardo and Smith (1994), Box and Tiao (1973), and Congdon (2006).

2.1
Basic Statistics
33
The great weakness with the Bayesian approach is that the scientist should be
able to specify a prior distribution of the unknown parameter. In a way, he should
be willing to and able to enter a bet on the values of this parameter. It is often
claimed that if the scientist is not willing to do this, he should use an objective prior;
for different formal ways to specify this concept, see Kass and Wasserman (1996). I
have recently used such a prior myself (see Helland et al., 2012), but even so I would
claim: There are many cases where the scientist could not or should not have any
fully speciﬁed prior opinion about the parameter, even not one based upon symmetry
or other “objective” criteria. In such cases he should resort to frequentist methods.
In statistical inference one should be ﬂexible, not staying with one approach which
should be imagined to cover all cases. Many modern statisticians argue for such a
ﬂexible attitude. An example is Efron (2015), who proposes a way to measure the
frequentist accuracy of Bayesian estimates.
Quite recently there has been proposed a frequentist alternative to a distribution
connected to a parameter: The conﬁdence distribution; see Schweder and Hjort
(2002, 2016) and Xie and Singh (2013). The main idea is that one looks upon the
conﬁdence interval for any value of the conﬁdence coefﬁcient γ . Let (−∞, t(γ, x)]
be a one-sided conﬁdence interval with coefﬁcient γ , where t(γ ) = t(γ, x) is an
increasing function, and x denotes the data. Then H(·) = t−1(·) is the conﬁdence
distribution for θ. This H is a distribution function and has the property that
H(θ, X) has a uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1] under the model, where
now X are the data seen pre-experimentally.
In general, look at any one-dimensional parameter θ, a function of the total
parameter φ. Then H(θ, x) is a cumulative conﬁdence distribution for θ provided
that it has a uniform distribution under the distribution of X, whatever the true value
of φ.
Conﬁdence distributions are often found by means of a pivot. A function
piv(θ, x) is a pivot if its distribution function G(u) = P(piv(θ, X) ≤u) is
independent of the underlying parameter φ. If the pivot is increasing in θ, we can
take H(θ, x) = G(piv(θ, x)).
According to Xie and Singh (2013), and also Schweder and Hjort (2016), which
is a very good monograph over conﬁdence distributions, the distribution function H
is to be looked upon as a distribution for the parameter, to be used in the epistemic
process, not a distribution of the parameter, as we have in the Bayesian approach.
Xie and Singh (2013) use the conﬁdence distribution as a general concept in order
to build a bridge between the Bayesian approach and various interpretations of the
frequentist approach. This may be seen to be in the spirit of the present book.
A conﬁdence probability for a parameter is in Schweder and Hjort (2016) called
an epistemic probability, and is of a different nature than ordinary probabilities,
called aleatoric probabilities. The latter are coupled to real randomness in the world,
and not only to our lack of knowledge attached to phenomena in the world. The
conﬁdence distributions are coupled to epistemic probabilities, or as Schweder and
Hjort write, they express what a rational observer thinks about the world in the
light of the model and the data. Schweder and Hjort claim that the conﬁdence
distributions are objective, in contrast to most Bayesian a posteriori distributions.

Statistical Inference
The following is a straightforward translation from a book report by Hermansen
et al. (2017):
‘For many Bayesians this distinction between two different interpretations of
probability is well known. For example (Gelman and Robert, 2013) write that
“priors are not reﬂections of a hidden “truth” but rather evaluation of the modeler’s
uncertainty about the parameter.” For the Bayesians of this school the parameter θ is
a ﬁxed, but unknown quantity, the prior distribution π(θ) is epistemic, while f (y|θ)
is aleatoric...One might say that as a Bayesian, one is not forced to regard θ as a
random variable from an ontological point of view, only mathematical. Schweder
and Hjort’s claim that the Bayesian “has only one form of probability, and has no
choice but to regard parameters as stochastic variables”, is therefore a simpliﬁcation.
It is true that the Bayesian only has one form for probability theory, the one built
upon Kolmogorov’s axioms, but that does not mean that the Bayesian is forced to
have one interpretation of what probability is.
While Bayesians like Gelman and Robert have one probability theory and two
interpretations of probability, the conﬁdencialist is forced to have two probability
theories, the one we know for the aleatoric and something else for the epistemic.
This is because the conﬁdence probabilities violate Kolmogorov’s axioms.’
In the general language of the present book, one might say that statisticians are
divided into three complementary schools, Bayesians, Frequentists, and Fiducials,
where the last school is inspired by what some call Fisher’s largest blunders, but
which contains techniques that have gained new popularity in recent years. It is
not quite true that these schools are completely disjoint; good statisticians may
use techniques from two or three schools. One can also ﬁnd connections between
the various approaches. There are now being arranged yearly international joint
Bayesian, Frequentist, and Fiducial (BFF) conferences (informally: Best Friends
Forever), where both practical, technical, and philosophical questions are discussed.
Three general books on statistical inference are Casella and Berger (1990), Bickel
and Doksum (2001), and Cox (2006). For a discussion of Fisher’s contributions with
a view towards the future, see Efron (1998). The recent book by Cox and Donnelly
(2011) discusses many aspects of applied statistics and also provides some links to
theoretical statistics.
2.1.4
Inference for Discrete E-variables
Opinion polls, or sample surveys, while very much used in practice, are not much
discussed in the standard mathematical statistical literature. But specialized books
like (Cochran, 1977) exist. The framework is that one has a ﬁnite population
consisting of N units, say N human beings, and one seeks some information
about this population from a smaller sample of n units. The simplest case is when
the sample is taken randomly from a register of the whole population, but other
sampling plans exist. To increase efﬁciency, one often uses stratiﬁed sampling:
The population is divided into k strata using some relevant criterion, such that the

2.1
Basic Statistics
35
numbers of unit in stratum i is Ni, and one samples randomly ni units from this
stratum. Of course k
i=1 Ni = N and k
i=1 ni = n.
As a simple epistemic problem, assume that an unknown number M in the
population possesses some speciﬁc property A, and one wants to use the sample to
estimate θ = M/N. This θ takes a discrete set of values 0, 1/N, . . . , N/N, and is
not always called a parameter. In this book we will use the more general concept of
an e-variable, a conceptual variable which is unknown before the epistemic process
begins. In general it is implicit in the concept of an e-variable that this is a quantity
that we want to gain knowledge about.
A more general problem is that each unit j in the population has some value yj
attached to it, and one wants to estimate θ = ¯ypopulation = N
j=1 yj/N. The simple
problem above is then obtained by specializing yj to be an indicator function. A
common estimate of θ is
θ =

sample yj/πj

sample 1/πj
,
where πj is the probability that unit j should be included in the sample. This can be
used for many sampling plans. For stratiﬁed sampling, we get θ = k
i=1 Ni ¯yi/N,
where the mean ¯yi is over the sample in stratum i.
Opinion polls are based on the assumption that each person “has” an opinion on
the issue that is focused upon. The fact that opinions may vary with time, and that
they may depend on the contexts, is perhaps realized, but it is not always discussed
in this connection. To see this ﬁrst from the point of view of the person being
interviewed, imagine for instance that a woman A has spent some time in a hotel,
and then after a few days receives a questionnaire by e-mail, one of the questions
being: “On a scale from 1 to 10, how do you evaluate the service at this hotel?” This
causes her to enter an epistemic process, mostly related to introspection. To begin
with, the score is some unknown number θ, but after a while she decides on a value
θ = uk, one of the values from 1 to 10.
This decision process may be evaluated subjectively by the woman A herself. We
may also consider the whole situation as looked upon by some person B knowing
her background. In this latter case prediction is relevant. The person B may have
access to some kind of data from a sample of size ni from a stratum consisting of
people with the same background as the woman, and to detailed information about
the hotel. On this basis, he may want to predict θ. Again this is an epistemic process
with a discrete e-variable; the target for the prediction of this e-variable is not a
population, but a single unit, the woman A in this case. B may wish a large ni
to have accurate data, but at the same time resources may be limited: He may be
forced to have a small ni in order to be able to predict from a fairly homogeneous
subpopulation.
Both in the introspection case and in the external observer case, one can consider
the following: Assume that the woman A had an unfortunate episode with the
receptionist of the hotel just before she left, and that the observer B does not know

36
2
Statistical Inference
about this episode. Let θ′ be the hypothetical score that A would have had if the
episode had not taken place. Depending on the further circumstances, θ′ may not be
accessible to the woman A herself, and θ may not be accessible to the observer B.
Considerations of this kind are here very vague, but they should give some feeling
of what I mean by an epistemic process when a single unit is involved. The situation
here is on the borderline or outside what one meets in ordinary statistics, but the
point is that it describes epistemic processes, and that one of these processes (the
prediction part) in principle can be made precise in statistical terms.
Such considerations will be important when I later will try to approach the
foundation of quantum mechanics from an intuitive point of view. The variables
of interest in quantum mechanics are discrete or continuous e-variables. They have
some properties in common with the parameters of statistics, and some properties
in common with the example just sketched. They are connected to single units
(particles) or to a few units. It is important to realize, however, that the e-variables of
quantum mechanics are connected to the microworld and to the relevant observers.
They have properties analogous to the e-variables of the macro-world, but they must
be considered as unique concepts.
The Bayesian concepts of prior and posterior distribution are straightforward
to formulate in the case of a discrete e-variable, and the concept of conﬁdence
distribution also carries over: If θ takes the values u1, . . . , uk, then the conﬁdence
coefﬁcient γ can take only k values, and the conﬁdence distribution H is determined
as follows: Let again (−∞, t(γ, x)] be a one-sided conﬁdence interval with coefﬁ-
cient γ , where t(γ ) = t(γ, x) on the k values. Then H(·) = t−1(·) can be extended
to a discrete distribution function for θ, which has the property that H(θ, X) for
data X has a uniform distribution on the k values H(u1), H(u2), . . . , H(uk) = 1.
From this cumulative distribution, point probabilities on u1, u2, . . . , uk are found.
Strictly speaking, this does not ﬁt into the general deﬁnition of Schweder and Hjort
(2016) of a conﬁdence distribution, which requires a uniform distribution on the
unit interval, but it satisﬁes their deﬁnition of an asymptotic conﬁdence distribution.
Since discrete e-variables will play an important role in the last part of the book, I
will take the liberty to use the word conﬁdence distribution here also.
2.2
Group Actions and Model Reduction
In simple random sampling, a natural objective prior for any e-variable θ is found by
giving the same probability 1/N to each unit in the population. This is the invariant
measure (see Appendix B) for the permutation group. In a more general statistical
setting, an epistemic problem related to an e-variable (parameter) θ may often have
some symmetry property associated with it, and this is formalized by introducing
a group of transformations acting upon the space Ωθ of the e-variable. When θ is
transformed by the group and the observations are transformed accordingly (see
Helland, 2004), one should get equivalent results from the statistical analysis. As a
trivial example: One should get equivalent results from a statistical analysis whether

2.2
Group Actions and Model Reduction
37
the parameters and the observations are measured in meters or in centimeters.
A summary of basic group theory is given in Appendix B, and group theory in
statistical inference is further discussed in Appendix F. Examples of groups acting
upon a parameter space are location: ξ →ξ + a for a real; scale group: σ →bσ
for b > 0; location and scale: (ξ, σ) →(a +bξ, bσ), where ξ is an expectation and
σ is a standard deviation; rotation in a multidimensional parameter space; a general
linear group acting upon a multidimensional parameter space, etc. Invariance under
a group may help improve the estimation or the inference in general.
I will not be very precise on the choice of G, but just say vaguely that we choose
G, if possible, in agreement with some symmetry aspect of the whole situation.
The model reduction that I will introduce now will later be relevant also in a
quantum theory setting. In order to be general, I will now for a moment use the term
“e-variable” instead of “parameter.” For the present discussion, one can just think
of this as a parameter, however. For a fuller discussion of group theory in statistical
inference, see Appendix F.
Now ﬁx a point θ0 in the e-variable space Ωθ. An orbit in this space under G is
the set of points of the form gθ0 as g varies over the group G. The different orbits
are disjoint, and θ0 can be replaced by any e-variable on the orbit. Any set in Ωθ
which is an orbit of G or can be written as a union of orbits is an invariant set under
G in Ωθ, and conversely, all invariant sets can be written in this way. If there is only
one orbit in Ωθ, the group is said to be acting transitively upon Ωθ.
A statistical model should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. In some cases
we may want to do a simpliﬁcation, a model reduction. This may take the form of
a reduction of the e-variable space Ωθ. Parts of this space which are essential for
the epistemic process, must always be retained, but irrelevant dimensions should be
left out. I will now formulate a general criterion which will be used throughout this
book:
If there is a group G acting upon the e-variable space Ωθ, any model reduction
should be to an orbit or to a set of orbits of G.
This will ensure that G also can be seen as a group acting upon the new e-
variable space. In particular, if the group actions form a transitive group G, no model
reduction is possible. An orbit or a set of orbits is also called an invariant set in the
e-variable space.
Example 2.1 Assume that a single set of observations is modeled by some large
parametric model, only assuming that parametric class contains the normal model.
Let the location and scale group be acting upon the parameter space Ωθ. Then
one orbit is given by the N(ξ, σ 2) distribution. This is not an uncommon model
reduction.
Example 2.2 Look at two independent sets of observations: (X1, . . . , Xm) inde-
pendent and identically N(ξ1, σ 2
1 ) and (Y1, . . . , Yn) independent and identically
N(ξ2, σ 2
2 ). Let G be the translation and scale group given by ξ1 →a1 + bξ1, σ1 →
bσ1, ξ2 →a2 + bξ2, σ2 →bσ2. Note that a common scale transformation by
b is assumed. Then the orbits of the group in the parameter space are given by

38
2
Statistical Inference
σ1/σ2 = constant. A common model reduction is given by σ1 = σ2. This simpliﬁes
the comparison of ξ1 and ξ2, which is often the goal of the investigation.
Example 2.3 Linear statistical models have a large range of applications. In general
these models have the form where the observations Yl are independent N(ξl, σ 2),
where the expectations ξl are linear combination of a set of parameters. In one
particular such model (the two-way analysis of variance model) the observations
Yijh have expectations μ + αi + βj + γij. To get a unique representation of this
kind, one often imposes the restrictions 
i αi = 0, 
j βj = 0, 
i γij = 0 for
each j and 
j γij = 0 for each i. Let the group G be given by all permutations of
the index i and all permutations of the index j. Then an obvious model reduction is
given by the invariant set where the expectation is μ + αi + βj. This is called the
model without interaction, and is a valid simpliﬁcation in some cases.
Example 2.4 Another example of a linear model is the polynomial regression model
Yi = β0 + β1xi + . . . + βpxp
i + Ei, where the Ei’s are independent N(0, σ 2) for
i = 1, . . . , n. Let G be the group deﬁned by translations in the x-space: x →x +a,
which generates a transformation group on the parameters (β0, . . . , βp). Then the
submodels Yi = β0 + β1xi + . . . + βqxq
i + Ei q < p correspond to invariant sets in
the parameter space.
Example 2.5 A further example of a linear model is the multiple regression model
Yi = β0 + β1xi1 + . . . + βpxip + Ei for i = 1, .., n with ﬁxed xij, which again
has many different applications. Consider ﬁrst the case where the xij are measured
in different units for different j. Then there is a natural transformation group given
by separate scale changes xij →kjxij (j = 1, . . . , p). This induces a group on
the regression parameters by βj →βj/kj (j = 1, . . ., p). The invariant sets in the
parameter space are found by putting some of the βj’s equal to 0. These reduced
models are well known from many applications of regression analysis.
Example 2.6 Consider the same multiple regression model as in Example 2.5, but
assume now that the explanatory variables xij all are measured in the same units. A
large class of transformations xi· →Qxi· may then be of interest. In particular, an
interesting case is when Q varies over the orthogonal matrices.
As here, and as in any linear model, estimates of the regression parameters can
in principle be found by the method of least squares, which is equivalent to the
maximum likelihood method. However, this method breaks down when p > n, or
more generally when one has collinearity problems such that the matrix which we
need to invert in order to implement the least squares solution, is singular. A large
number of alternative estimation methods are proposed in the statistical literature to
tackle this problem, but it seems very difﬁcult to decide which of these methods one
should use in practice.
For this problem, one place where one may start the investigation is that many
of the methods are equivariant under the transformation induced by rotation in the
x-space: A transformation on θ found from transformations of the data is the same
as the corresponding transformation on the parameter θ.

2.2
Group Actions and Model Reduction
39
Before I return to this problem, I will summarize a little more theory. In Appendix
B the concept of a right invariant measure for the group is deﬁned, and it is
recommended that such a prior is used as an objective prior. Among other things
it is proved in Helland (2004, 2010) that there for a transitive group is a very
close connection between conﬁdence intervals and Bayesian credibility intervals
in this case. It follows from this that there is a close connection between conﬁdence
distributions and posterior distributions with this prior.
Concerning for instance equivariant estimators, there is a generalization of an
old theorem by Pitman, which is proved in Helland (2010), showing that if the loss
function is invariant and proportional to the quadratic loss, if the group is transitive
and what is called proper, and a right invariant prior is used, then the posterior mean,
if ﬁnite, is the best equivariant estimator.
Example 2.6 (continued) Look at a modiﬁcation of the model in Example 2.6
where the explanatory variables are random variables Xij. This is natural in many
observational studies. For simplicity, assume that all variables are centered: E(Yi) =
0 and E(Xij) = 0. Then the model is Yi = β1Xi1+. . .+βpXip +Ei for i = 1, .., n,
where the Ei are independent of X1, . . . , Xp.. Let x be the covariance matrix of
the x-variables, which can be deﬁned by the property that Var(
j ajXij) = aT xa
for all vectors a = (a1, . . . , ap)T . Then β = (β1, . . . , βp)T can always be expanded
in terms of an orthogonal set of eigenvectors di of x:
β =
p

i=1
γidi.
(2.5)
In this expansion, the number of terms can be reduced in two ways: (1) Some of
the eigenvalues may be coinciding. Then the eigenvectors in this eigenspace can be
rotated in such a way that there is just one eigenvector in this space which has a non-
zero component along β. (2) The vector β has no component in this eigenspace. So
an interesting reduced model is the one with m non-zero terms in (2.5). The ordering
of the terms in (2.5) is arbitrary, so the reduced models only specify the number m
of non-zero terms, not which terms that are non-zero. It is not difﬁcult to show
that these models for different m are exactly the orbits of the following group G:
Rotations in the x-space and hence of the eigenvectors di augmented by independent
scale transformations γi →aiγi where ai > 0.
In some regression situations, for instance if p is larger than the number n of
observations, the ordinary least squares estimator of β breaks down, and different
schools propose different estimates of β. By stretching one of the basic concepts of
this book, we might say that β is inaccessible. In any case, β and x are conceptual
variables, and the reduced model above is a model using conceptual variables. When
proposed as such in Helland (1990), it was inspired by the chemometricians’ partial
least squares algorithm, an algorithm with data. When I later will discuss quantum
mechanics, it will be important to distinguish between data and conceptual variables.

40

Statistical Inference
It is shown in Helland et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2013) that these reduced
models coincide with reduced models introduced by researchers from two different
traditions: The envelope model of Cook et al. (2010) and a natural population model
arising from the partial least squares algorithmic “soft” models from chemometrics.
Maximum likelihood estimation and other estimators under the reduced model are
discussed in Cook et al. (2013) and Bayes estimation in Helland et al. (2012). The
invariant prior induced by the group leads to an undeﬁned posterior expectation, so
a best equivariant estimator cannot be found from this. However approximating the
scale prior with a proper prior leads to β-estimates, hence predictions, which seem
to have good properties.
These two estimators assume a multinormal distribution of {Xij, Yi}. However,
both the chemometric tradition and the envelope model of Cook et al. (2010, 2013)
demand no detailed distributional assumptions.
A systematic comparison of estimators under the multinormal envelope/PLS
model is now carried out by Helland et al. (2018). This is based upon a computer
package which is being developed by Sæbø et al. (2015).
Finally I give for completeness a simple example of model reduction for the case
where the e-variable in question is not a continuous parameter.
Example 2.7 In stratiﬁed random sampling, the natural group G is the group of
independent permutations within each stratum. The orbits of G are then given by
the single strata, and model reductions to invariant sets are given by reduction to
any set of strata. Such a reduction is of course natural in cases where one want to
limit the investigation to a particular set of strata.
2.3
Interlude
Before the epistemic process, one has an unknown e-variable θ. What is the
situation after one has gone through an epistemic process? In the case where θ is
the parameter of a statistical model, the situation can be summarized as follows:
Depending upon the statistical philosophy used, one has either a conﬁdence interval
[θ(x), ¯θ(x)] or a credibility interval [θ∗(x), θ∗(x)]. In both cases, assume that
the coefﬁcient γ is very high, say 0.999. Then the practical conclusion from the
epistemic process is that the new state is speciﬁed by saying that θ belongs to this
interval.
Conﬁdence intervals or credibility intervals for discrete e-variables are not much
discussed in the statistical literature, but the concepts carry over. One difference
is that when one has very much data or the experimental uncertainty is very low,
the intervals can degenerate into a single point. In the following, it will make the
discussion much simpler to consider such a case. Assume that one has this situation,
and let again the coefﬁcient γ is very high, say larger than 0.999. Then in the
frequentist case, one has a conclusion of the type Pθ[θ(X) = uk] = γ with
realized data X = x, and in the Bayesian case one has a posterior probability

2.3
Interlude
41
P[θ = uk|x] = γ . In both cases we may conclude for practical purposes that the
new state is given by θ = uk, and that this value can be used in further investigations.
Any epistemic process starts with an unknown e-variable θ, and when the process
ends, one has some knowledge about θ. A state is obtained when this knowledge is
almost certain. In the simplest case the knowledge can be expressed by a certain
ﬁxed value θ = uk. This situation can be realized by a statistical investigation
with a discrete parameter/e-variable, but it can also be realized in other epistemic
situations. One example is when a person through introspection makes up his or
her mind on a particular issue, as illustrated with the woman answering an opinion
poll in Sect. 2.1.4. Again we can talk about a state when the person’s knowledge
about his/her opinion is almost certain. Looking upon the process of achieving an
opinion on an issue as an epistemic process is an example of a decision. Decisions
in statistics are discussed in Chap. 6 below, and other decisions are discussed
in Chap. 7. Many examples of everyday decisions can be given, some realized
through the communication with other people. Some of these processes start with
an unknown θ and end up with an (almost) sure state θ = uk. Other examples of this
are connected to prediction of some variable. In these last examples, the e-variable
is typically attached to a single unit, not to a population of units, which is the most
common situation in statistical investigations.
The example in Sect. 2.1.4 illustrates another issue: Here one e-variable θ is
accessible to the woman A herself, while another e-variable θ′ (the hypothetical
score if a certain episode had not taken place) is accessible to the person B
knowing her background and having information about the hotel. The reason for
this difference is that the two persons have different background knowledge. We
will come back to similar situations later when discussing quantum mechanics.
Returning now to statistics, nearly all papers on statistical inference have data
models, that is, either parametric or nonparametric models of the observed data,
as their point of departure. Also, statistical practice is deeply founded upon this
tradition. Even though a different culture was promoted and discussed by Breiman
(2001), the data modeling culture is now more dominant than ever.
Nor will this book depart radically from this culture, but we will add an element
to it: Every decision in any experimental or observational setting is made in a
context. This context may not be trivial and may have decisive inﬂuence on how
the inference should be made. The context may be in parts be formed by the
historical and cultural background for the study, and it may depend upon earlier
decisions. But it can also in addition be conceptual, including the formulated goal
of the investigation, the model, a loss function, and/or a Bayesian prior. Also
the framework for the study must be considered as a part of the context: The
experimental units available, what can be measured on these units; limitations in
terms of money, time, and human resources.
In order to be able to discuss contexts in general, it turns out to be useful ﬁrst to
give a precise deﬁnition of what we mean by conceptual variables, which includes
observations, parameters, latent variables, and more. Then we deﬁne e-variables,
which up to now has been a loosely deﬁned concept.

Statistical Inference
In statistical theory, a parameter is often deﬁned as an index of a class of
distributions, but in statistical practice, a parameter is often a quantity of interest
in itself, introduced as an expectation, a variance, a covariance, a correlation, a
regression coefﬁcient, or a probability. These two facets of the parameter concepts
may to some extent be regarded as complementary, even though this introduces no
logical difﬁculty.
In the statistical tradition, a parameter is usually connected to a hypothetical
inﬁnite population, but in fact parts of the statistical theory—in reality nearly
everything that is not related to asymptotical considerations—can be generalized
to the case where the parameter is replaced by a conceptual variable connected to a
single unit or to a few units.
In addition to the unknown conceptual variable there are data z. The purpose of
an experiment is then to use these data to answer questions formulated in terms of
the conceptual variable. This will be the background for our approach to essential
parts of quantum theory later in this book. Quantum theory is not statistics, but both
give examples of epistemic processes involving observations.

Chapter 3
Inference in an Epistemic Process
Abstract A conceptual variable is deﬁned, and on this background the e-variable
is given a precise deﬁnition. Also, the context of an epistemic process is deﬁned.
One can formulate a precise setting called a generalized experiment, and in this
setting sufﬁciency and conditioning are discussed. The conditionality principle and
the sufﬁciency principle are seen as intuitively obvious. Birnbaum’s theorem states
that the likelihood principle follows from these two principles. Everything is seen
in the context given by an epistemic process.
3.1
Conceptual Variables and Contexts
Fisher (1922) introduced the concept of parametric models in the way it is used
throughout statistics today. According to Stigler (1976) and Cook (2007), the
word “parameter” is mentioned 57 times in that groundbreaking paper. Recently,
(Taraldsen and Lindqvist, 2010) argued that in Bayesian inference the parameters
and the potential observations should be deﬁned on the same underlying measure
space. This is one point of departure of the present book. Another point of departure
is that in any situation where inference is supposed to be done, several other types
of unknown variables than parameters are of relevance (one simple example is in
prediction), and that additional types of variables are needed to describe the context
of the experiment or observational study.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Consider any experimental or observational situation at a given time
or over some time span, more generally any epistemic process. Any variable which
can be deﬁned in words by a person or by a group of persons in that situation is
called a conceptual variable.
This term was indicated in Helland (2010), where it also was argued that some
unknown conceptual variables could be inaccessible, that is, they could not be given
a value with arbitrary accuracy through estimation or prediction in any way in the
given situation. This was taken as the ﬁrst step in a line of reasoning indicating a
connection between theoretical statistics and quantum theory, a line of reasoning
that I will continue below.

Inference in an Epistemic Process
In the following, I may sometimes alternately speak about one conceptual
variable and several conceptual variables in the same way as we may talk about
a multivariate parameter or several one-dimensional parameters.
Several classes of conceptual variables are of interest in a statistical investigation,
depending upon the situation:
•
Context variables: The background variables for an experiment or observational
study.
•
OCVs (observed conceptual variables): Data or preset values.
•
Statistics: Known functions of the data.
•
Quasi-statistics: Known or unknown functions of the data.
•
Input variables and responses/output variables. As used in prediction and regres-
sion, cp. Hastie et al. 2009.
•
UCVs (unknown conceptual variables): For instance parameters, latent variables,
or a response for a new set of input variables.
•
Hypothesis variables: Concepts from which one may formulate assertions about
the value of a parameter.
•
Conclusion variables: Conceptual variables by which one may formulate the
conclusions from an experiment or observational study.
Most variables in this book are either real variables, vector variables, or
variables belonging to some function space. But in principle a variable can be
anything. The conclusion variable may be a journal article, its summary, or part
of the article.
In this book, I will consider any epistemic process.
Deﬁnition 3.2 A conceptual variable which is used in an essential way in an
epistemic process is called an e-variable θ. Before the epistemic process is started,
the e-variable is unknown. After the process, one is able to achieve some information
about the e-variable, the simplest case being that we know its value: θ = uk, a type
of information which is only possible for discrete e-variables.
In this book the concept of e-variable will be very important. In the same way
as a parameter in statistics can be any property for a population, an e-variable can
represent any property for a population, a single unit, or a group of units. The sole
requirement is that it shall be used in an epistemic process. Like a parameter, it is a
theoretical variable before the process, but one will have concrete information about
the value of the e-variable after the epistemic process.
As indicated in Chap. 1, the concept of e-variables is also important in quantum
mechanics. In this and the following chapters, I will focus much on discrete simple
e-variables, which are essentially what is called observables in quantum mechanics.
The fact that these observables may be associated with operators of a Hilbert space
will be the theme of the next chapters. The discussion of the present chapter will
focus upon generalized experiments and upon properties that are shared between
the parameters of experiments in statistics and the e-variables of experiments in
quantum mechanics. We have similar kinds of epistemic processes in mind for the
two cases.

3.1
Conceptual Variables and Contexts
47
We also have the important concept of a context of an epistemic process.
Deﬁnition 3.3 In the case of an experiment the context includes the setting of the
experiment, similarly for an observational study. But in general for any epistemic
process it also includes the background for the process, historical, speciﬁc, and
conceptual. The conceptual background for any study should always include a
formulated goal of the study.
In a series of experiments or in a meta-analysis, the conclusions from one
situation may be used as a part of the context of the next situation. In a quantum
mechanical situation, it is important to distinguish between the preparation of the
physical system and the measurement on the system. The preparation then forms
the context for the measurement.
Several operations may be done on any assertion containing conceptual variables,
including ¬ (negation), ∧(and), and ∨(or). Formulating statements connected
to a concrete experimental or observational situation may then be done using
propositional logic, a subject which has a large abstract literature. As formulated in
Appendix E, I want to be more concrete and regard sentences formulated in ordinary,
everyday language as primitive entities.
There is a close connection between propositional logic and set theory, where
we identify ¬ with complement, ∧with intersection, and ∨with union. Such
identiﬁcations are often done implicitly in elementary textbooks in probability. Let
(
′, F ′) be the measurable space thus obtained, where F ′ is a σ-algebra of subsets
of 
′. On some measurable subset 
 of 
′, one can deﬁne conditional probability
measures related to one conceptual variable given other conceptual variables, where
the conceptual variable conditioned upon may or may not belong to 
, that is, may
or may not be measurable functions on (
, F), where F = {A ∩
 : A ∈F ′}.
Strictly speaking, conditioning here must be taken as more general than the usual
conditioning in statistics where we condition upon σ-algebras. We are talking in
general about probabilities, given some information, so that we should wish to stay
within the framework of propositional logic. As indicated in Appendix E, however,
it seems like we need some extra assumptions in this framework to make the
conditional probabilities precise in general. Therefore I will in this book stay within
the probabilistic framework and limit myself to conditional probabilities given a
σ-algebra as deﬁned by (2.1). Conditional probabilities, given some conceptual
variable τ which is a random variable on (
, F), is deﬁned as the conditional
probability, given the σ-algebra generated by this conceptual variable, that is, the
collection of sets τ −1(B), where B runs through the relevant Borel sets. Conditional
probabilities, given some non-random variable τ are simply measurable functions
of this variable.
When considering conditional probabilities, given the context, in most cases only
part of the context will be relevant. The conceptual variables on which probabilities
can be deﬁned will be called random variables. For simplicity, technical problems
resulting from the fact that conditional distributions are only deﬁned almost surely,
are mostly disregarded in this book. However, difﬁculties from this in the deﬁnition
of sufﬁciency (see Lehmann and Casella, 1998) will be addressed.

48

Inference in an Epistemic Process
A statistical model is deﬁned as a conditional distribution of the data, given all
parameters (together with the context, including preset values). It is assumed as
usual that this class is dominated, that is, all conditional distributions are absolute
continuous with respect to some ﬁxed conditional probability measure P, given
the context, where Q is deﬁned to be absolutely continuous with respect to P if
P(A) = 0 implies Q(A) = 0.
In addition, if a Bayesian analysis is to be carried out, there is a prior distribution
of the parameters (again given the context). To allow for objective priors, I will,
in agreement with Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2010) allow these measures to be
unnormalized; see that paper and also the recent paper by McCullagh and Han
(2011) on how logical difﬁculties with this can be avoided. Note that I talk about
a Bayesian analysis to be carried out, not about Bayesian or frequentist research
workers. The same person may in certain cases carry out both types of analysis, ﬁrst
a frequentist analysis and then at a later point of time a Bayesian analysis.
In the following, I will depart from my earlier notation and also denote random
data by lower case letters. It will be clear from the context whether I talk about the
pre-experimental or post-experimental situation. The statistical model will, if this is
natural, be seen from a pre-experimental point of view.
As a particular case, I may also look at the following prediction or learning
situation: In the statistical model, let yi have some identical conditional distribution,
given xi and some ﬁxed parameter ζ for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, and assume that these
distributions are independent. In addition xi (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., n) may or may not
have some identical independent distributions given a parameter κ, and ζ and κ may
or may not have priors. I assume that y0 is unknown, but the other yi’s are observed
data. The xi’s are data or preset values. Thus here the UCVs—the e-variables—
are y0, ζ and κ, while the OCVs—the data z in the case where the xi’s are not
preset—are {xi, yi; i = 1, . . . , n} and x0. In principle the variables may belong to
any topological space and the σ-algebras of relevance may be contained in the Borel
σ-algebra, but in most practical cases they are constrained to subsets of Euclidean
spaces. In this case y0 is the e-variable of interest. This is a simple e-variable, but it
is important to emphasize that it is not of the same nature as the simple e-variables
of quantum mechanics; see Sect. 3.3 below.
The situation sketched above is the conceptual basis for much of Hastie et al.
(2009) (supervised learning).
3.2
Data; Generalized Sufﬁciency and Ancillarity
Let z be a statistic, and let τ be a conceptual variable. The following two
assumptions are taken as basic throughout this section and in much of this book.
Any setting where these two assumptions are satisﬁed, will be called a generalized
experiment.

3.2
Data; Generalized Sufﬁciency and Ancillarity
49
(1) The distribution of z, given τ, depends on an unknown parameter θ.
(2) If τ or part of τ has a distribution, this is independent of θ. The part of τ
which does not have a distribution is functionally independent of θ. However,
separated from this, there may be a prior for θ which depends upon τ.
To ﬁx ideas, think of (1) and (2) as describing a situation where inference on θ
is sought from the data z in the context described by τ, but there are variants of
this. In a simple experiment, z may be the whole data set, and τ may be trivial
or some nuisance parameter. In addition, τ may contain the real context of the
experiment, which it always will, but this is often just taken as an implicit fact. In a
series of experiments, ordered in time, z may be the data set of the last experiment,
and the context τ may contain some or all of the conceptual variables connected
to the earlier experiments. In a meta-analysis, z may contain all data sets, and τ
may contain all contexts. It is a basic condition that the model assumptions are rich
enough so that (1) and (2) are meaningful.
In quantum mechanics, it is not so common to distinguish between data and e-
variable/parameter, because one often talks about perfect measurements. But in real
measurements, such a distinction is necessary. With preparations τ, measurement
data z, and the parameter θ focused on, we are again in the situation of a
generalized experiment; see Sect. 1.5.5. The purpose of the experiment may be to
gain knowledge about θ.
3.2.1
Sufﬁciency
We let t be a known or unknown function of z. Later I will give an example of the
perhaps unfamiliar situation where we have an unknown function of the data. The
concept of sufﬁciency was introduced by Fisher as a tool for reducing the data in a
given situation without sacriﬁcing anything related to the inference on the parameter
θ. A very simple example is when we have data z = (y1, . . . , yn), where the yi are
assumed independent and identically N(μ, σ 2). Then t(z) = ( ¯y, s2) is sufﬁcient for
θ = (μ, σ 2). Here s2 = (yi −¯y)2/(n −1).
Deﬁnition 3.4 We say that t = t(z) is a (z, τ)-sufﬁcient quasi-statistic for θ if the
conditional distribution of z, given t, τ, and θ is independent of θ. If z is the whole
data set, we say just that t is τ-sufﬁcient.
From the fact that (1) is meaningful, it follows that the conditional distribu-
tion of z, given t, τ, and θ is meaningful. However, difﬁculties (Lehmann and
Casella, 1998) may arise because the conditional distribution is only deﬁned almost
everywhere. I then follow Reid (1995) in making the deﬁnition more precise: The
quasi-statistic t(z) is (z, τ)-sufﬁcient if there is a transformation from z to (t, v)

50
3
Inference in an Epistemic Process
such that the densities satisfy
f (z|θ, τ) ∝f (t|θ, τ)f (v|t, τ),
where the constant of proportionality is independent of θ. This is a version of the
factorization theorem: t(z) is (z, τ)-sufﬁcient if and only if there exist functions
g(t|θ, τ) and h(z|τ) such that for all z and θ we have
f (z|θ, τ) = g(t(z)|θ, τ)h(z|τ).
Ordinary sufﬁciency results if τ is trivial, θ is the full parameter, and t is a
statistic. The case where part of τ is a nuisance parameter is also of interest. The
general concept is of interest also in many other situations.
In general, if t(z) is a (z, τ)-sufﬁcient statistic, the rest of the distribution of z can
be thought of as generated by some randomization independent of θ, and gives no
information about the parameter. This will be made precise by a sufﬁciency principle
formulated later.
It is clear that t = z is a (z, τ)-sufﬁcient statistic, but usually we are interested in
smaller functions of z. In general a minimal sufﬁcient observator will not exist, but
translating a result from ordinary sufﬁciency theory, any boundedly complete (z, τ)
observator will be minimal sufﬁcient.
Deﬁnition 3.5 A (z, τ)-sufﬁcient quasi-statistic t is boundedly complete if for all
bounded functions h
E(h(t)|θ, τ) = 0 for all θ implies P(h(t) = 0|θ, τ) = 1 for all θ.
Proposition 3.1 (Bahadur’s Theorem) Suppose that t takes values in a k-
dimensional Euclidean space and that t is a (z, τ)-sufﬁcient and boundedly
complete quasi-statistic. Then t is a minimal (z, τ)-sufﬁcient quasi-statistic.
Assume that we on the basis of data z want to estimate the parameter θ in the
context given by τ.
Deﬁnition 3.6 If t(z) is a minimal sufﬁcient quasi-statistic for θ, and the distribu-
tion of t depends on a part of τ, we say that this part is relevant for the estimation
of θ.
Example 3.1 Let z = (y1, . . . , yn), where y1, . . . , yn are independent and iden-
tically distributed (i.i.d.) N(μ, σ 2). Then ( ¯y, s2) is sufﬁcient for (μ, σ 2), where
s2 = (n −1)−1 n
i=1(yi −¯y)2. However, even in this simple example it is of
interest which parameter we focus upon. Write the log likelihood as
lnf = k+ 1
2σ 2
n

i=1
(yi−μ)2+1
2ln(σ 2) = k+ 1
2σ 2
n

i=1
[(yi−¯y)2+n(¯y−μ)2]+1
2ln(σ 2).

3.2
Data; Generalized Sufﬁciency and Ancillarity
51
From this we see:
(a) If τ contains the nuisance parameter σ 2, then ¯y is (minimal) (z, τ)-sufﬁcient for
μ.
(b) If τ contains the nuisance parameter μ, then n
i=1(yi −μ)2 is (minimal) (z, τ)-
sufﬁcient for σ 2. This is an example of an unknown function of the data where
the concept of sufﬁciency is of interest.
In each case the minimality of the sufﬁcient quasi-statistic can be proved from
Proposition 3.1.
We conclude from this that σ 2 is irrelevant for the (point-)estimation of μ, while
μ is relevant for the estimation of σ 2.
3.2.2
Ancillarity and Conditioning
Next I turn to the generalization of ancillarity, another basic concept introduced by
Fisher.
Deﬁnition 3.7 We say that u = u(z) is a (z, τ)-ancillary quasi-statistic for θ if the
conditional distribution of u, given τ is independent of θ.
If u is (z, τ)-ancillary and f is a measurable function, then f (u) is (z, τ)-
ancillary. In the corresponding partial ordering of statistics (u < v if u = f (v) for
some function f ), z is an upper bound. By Zorn’s Lemma, one or several maximal
ancillaries will exist. We say that u is τ-ancillary if z is the whole data set; just
ancillary if τ is trivial.
A very important and much discussed question is when one should condition
upon ancillaries. Once one has conditioned upon an ancillary, this can be taken as
part of the context of the experiment or the observational study. Thus the context is
expanded, but after this expansion, (1) and (2) in the beginning of Sect. 3.2 will still
hold. A closer discussion of the question of conditioning will be given in the next
section, but as a background for this discussion we will sketch some examples.
A basic argument for conditioning is given by the following example:
Example 3.2 (Berger and Wolpert 1988; Cox 1958) Consider two potential labora-
tory experiments for the same unknown parameter θ such that E 1 is planned to be
carried out in New York while E 2 is planned to be carried out in San Francisco.
The owner of the material to be sent chooses to toss an unbiased coin, deciding E 1
with probability 1/2 and E 2 with probability 1/2. Consider the whole experiment E
including the coin toss, and let u be the result of the coin toss. Here u is ancillary,
and everybody would condition upon u in the statistical analysis.
A problem with the requirement of conditioning is that maximal ancillaries may
not be unique.

52

Inference in an Epistemic Process
Example 3.3 Let θ be a scalar parameter between −1 and +1. Consider a multi-
nomial distribution on four cells with respective probabilities p1 = (1 + θ)/6,
p2 = (2 −θ)/6, p3 = (1 −θ)/6, and p4 = (2 + θ)/6 and total number of
observations n. Let the corresponding observed numbers in the sample be z1, z2, z3,
and z4. Recall from Sect. 2.1.2 that the multinomial distribution is a generalization
of the binomial distribution with multivariate point probabilities
n!
z1!z2!z3!z4!pz1
1 pz2
2 pz3
3 pz4
4 .
Then one can show that each of the statistics
u1 = z1 + z2, u2 = z1 + z3
is ancillary for θ, but they are not jointly ancillary. And conditioning upon u1,
respectively u2 leads to distinct inference (the maximum likelihood estimator is the
same, but the asymptotic variances are different).
Cox (1971) has proposed an intrinsic criterion for the choice of ancillary to
condition upon in such cases, but my opinion is that this choice should depend upon
the context.
Example 3.4 In a certain city the sex ratio is 1:1, and it is known that 1/3 of the
population have their own cellphone. The ratio between female and male cellphone
owners is an unknown quantity (1 + θ)/(1 −θ), where −1 < θ < 1. One is
interested in estimating θ by sampling randomly n persons from a register of the
city population. It is assumed that the population is much larger than the sample
size n.
Let the number of men in the sample be u1, and let u2 persons in the sample
be owners of cellphones. Thus u1 = z1 + z2 and u2 = z1 + z3, where z1 and
z2 are the male cellphone owners and non-owners, respectively, and z3 and z4
are the corresponding female numbers. The joint distribution of z1, . . . , z4 is as in
Example 3.3. Again each of u1 and u2 are ancillary, but they are not jointly ancillary.
Another question is whether or not one should always condition upon ancillaries.
The following examples give a background for that discussion.
Example 3.5 (Helland 1995) As a part of a larger medical experiment, two inde-
pendent individuals (1) and (2) have been on a certain diet for some time, and by
taking samples at the beginning and at the end of that period some response like the
change in blood cholesterol levels is measured. For the individual i (i = 1, 2), the
measured response is yi, which is modeled as independent normal (μi, σ 2) with a
known measurement variance σ 2.
Because the two individuals have been given the same treatment (diet) in the
larger experiment, the parameter of interest is not μ1 and μ2, but their mean: θ =
1
2(μ1 + μ2).

3.2
Data; Generalized Sufﬁciency and Ancillarity
53
Suppose now that for some reason we have only capacity to measure one of the
individuals, but at the outset, we do not know which. Let u be the indicator of the
individual chosen. It is clear that, given u, that is, given the person chosen, we get
no information about θ. But choosing u randomly with probability 1
2 for each of the
two values will give us such information, provided that the identity of the individual
chosen is not revealed. The last statement follows from a sampling argument: The
situation is a special case of a sampling situation where n individuals are sampled
randomly from a population of N individuals where the parameter of interest is the
mean in the population. In addition there is a measurement error for each individual,
modeled as independently normal (0, σ 2). It is then clear that the sample mean of
the observations is an appropriate estimator of this population mean. It is equally
clear that this conclusion also must be valid for the special case N = 2, n = 1, the
situation at hand.
The surprising aspect of this example is that a situation with less information
can give us more ability to do inference: By not knowing u we can make some
(admittedly uncertain, but nevertheless valid) inference on θ; when we know u,
such an inference is impossible.
Example 3.6 Consider a sensory analysis ﬁrm where there is a staff of N trained
assessors and a panel of n out of these are selected randomly to taste a particular
product. A report is written. Given the assessors, what they do in the analysis must
be considered as separate experiments on a common parameter θ. Consider the
whole investigation, and let u be the result of choosing randomly the assessors to
take part in it. Again u is ancillary. But in this case, it may not be immediately
natural to condition upon u in the written report.
3.2.3
Conditioning and the Conditionality Principle
Any statistical investigation has to start with a conceptual analysis. This includes
choosing question of interest, collect earlier information on this question, the choice
of design or sampling plan, choosing target population and sampling units, the
choice of a model and maybe of a loss function, etc. The result of this analysis must
be considered as a part of the context of the estimation and prediction problem. Then
data are collected.
Assume now a generalized experiment, that is, a setting where assumptions (1),
(2) in the beginning of Sect. 3.2 are satisﬁed, and let u be a (z, τ)-ancillary quasi-
statistic in this setting. All the examples in Sect. 3.2.2 satisfy these assumptions.
Example 3.2 is the typical situation, and a situation where it is obvious that one
should condition upon u.
To choose the conditioning in Example 3.4, one must specify further. Suppose
that the data collection is done by ﬁrst ﬁnding out whether the person in question is
a man or woman, thereafter asking about cellphone ownership, then the conditioning
should be done upon sex. In the opposite case, if the data collection is done from
a register of cellphone owners, later asking about sex, then one should condition

54
3
Inference in an Epistemic Process
upon cellphone ownership. In the case where the data are found from a register
containing both information on sex and cellphone ownership, one should perhaps
condition upon both variables, even though we do not have joint ancillarity here.
The last two examples describe different situations. First consider Example 3.5.
Here the parameter of interest θ is a function of the inaccessible conceptual variable
φ = (μ1, μ2), and an ancillary for θ is the choice u of a person to investigate. This
is chosen randomly, and is at the outset unknown to the experimentalist. Assuming
that u takes some deﬁnite value, let μu be the value of μ for the speciﬁc person
chosen. The point is that information about u may give information about μu, but
no information about the parameter of interest θ = 1
2(μ1 + μ2).
The Generalized Principle for Conditioning [GPC] Assume that u is a maximal
(z, τ)-ancillary quasi-statistic for a parameter θ.
(1) Assume that the generalized experiment obtained by knowing the value of
u has θ as the parameter. Then one should condition upon u. If there are
several maximal such u’s to choose between, one should condition upon the
one corresponding to the data that have ﬁrst been obtained.
(2) If knowledge of u will imply a generalized experiment with another parameter
than θ, one should not condition upon u.
Some texts require z to be a minimal sufﬁcient statistic for the conditionality
principle to apply. Part (1) is consistent with the conditioning chosen in Example 3.2
and in Example 3.4. This is the most common situation, and is often thought about
as just the principle of conditioning. Part (2) is consistent with the decision not
to condition in Example 3.5, since the parameter in the experiment obtained by
conditioning is μu, not θ, which is the parameter of interest.
Example 3.6 is a bordering situation. In most cases, a user of the results of the
sensory analysis will not be interested in which assessors that are chosen, will not
ask for this information, and will thus not condition upon this information. More
precisely, if one conditions, the parameter of the conditioned experiment will be the
mean for the n chosen assessors, while the parameter of interest will most probably
be a population mean.
I have given a normative form of the conditionality principle. For the further
development in this book it is also important to consider a descriptive form, which
is often given in the literature; see Berger and Wolpert (1988). In this case, the notion
“one should condition upon ...” translates into “...the unconditioned experiment
contains no experimental evidence on θ in addition to that of the conditioned
experiment.” As in Berger and Wolpert (1988), the concept of “experimental
evidence” is left undeﬁned, i.e., it can be made precise in any reasonable way.
The Generalized Weak Conditionality Principle [GWCP] Suppose that there
are two generalized experiments E1 and E2 with common parameter θ and with
equivalent contexts τ. Consider the mixed experiment E∗, whereby u = 1 or
2 is observed, each having probability 1/2 (independent of θ, the data of the
experiments and the contexts), and the experiment Eu is then performed. Then the

3.2
Data; Generalized Sufﬁciency and Ancillarity
55
evidence about θ from E∗is just the same as the evidence from the experiment
actually performed.
Note that this corresponds to the situation (1) of the GPC: The variable u is a
statistic here; the two experiments are known to the experimentalist. Two contexts τ
and τ ′ are deﬁned to be equivalent if there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the relevant parts of them: τ ′ = f (τ), τ = f −1(τ ′).
3.2.4
The Sufﬁciency and Likelihood Principles
The motivation behind the deﬁnition of a sufﬁcient statistic is that one wants to
reduce the data and still get the same information about the parameter. One version
of the sufﬁciency principle, as formulated in Berger and Wolpert (1988), translates
to our setting as follows:
The Generalized Weak Sufﬁciency Principle [GWSP] Consider a generalized
experiment in a context τ as described above, let z be the data of that experiment,
and let θ be the parameter connected to the experiment. Assume that (1) and (2)
of Sect. 3.2 are satisﬁed. Let t = t(z) be a (z, τ)-sufﬁcient statistic for θ. Then, if
t(z1) = t(z2), the data z1 and z2 contain the same experimental evidence about θ
in the context τ.
There can be given many examples to support the GWSP. The simplest example
is an independent measurement series z = (y1, . . . , yn), where the yi’s are normal
(μ, σ 2). If σ 2 is known, ¯y = n−1  yi is sufﬁcient for μ, and any reasonable
inference is based upon ¯y. If σ 2 is unknown, then t(z) = ( ¯y, s2) is sufﬁcient for
θ = (μ, σ 2), where s2 = (n −1)−1 (yi −¯y)2. (The denominator n −1 makes
s2 an unbiased estimator of σ 2.) Any reasonable inference on θ under the normal
model is based upon t(z). This kind of data reduction was Fisher’s motivation for
introducing the concept of sufﬁciency.
The general argument for the GWSP runs as follows: By Fisher’s factorization
theorem, if t(z) is sufﬁcient for θ, then the probability density can be written as
f (z|θ) = g(t(z)|θ)h(z), where h(z) is independent of θ. But then a hypothetical
experiment, where h(z) is generated by a computer simulation, will give the same
information an θ as the real experiment.
Now following an argument from Berger and Wolpert (1988), using the GWSP
and the GWCP, which we will regard as more or less obvious, we can derive
the following likelihood principle. This result is a classical theorem ﬁrst given by
Birnbaum (1962). The argument is reproduced for completeness in Appendix A for
the discrete case; this is in fact the case I need later in the discussion of quantum
mechanics. For the continuous case, see Berger and Wolpert (1988).
A version of the likelihood principle will be used later as a partly motivation of
Born’s formula in quantum mechanics.

with equivalent contexts τ, and assume that θ is the same full parameter in both
experiments. Suppose that two observations z∗
1 and z∗
2 have proportional likelihoods
in the two experiments, where the proportionality constant c is independent of θ.
Then these two observations produce the same experimental evidence on θ in this
context.
Two contexts are said to be equivalent if one can establish a one-to-one function
between all variables involved.
Since both my deﬁnition of ancillary and my deﬁnition of sufﬁcient statistic
depend on the context, and therefore the context is kept ﬁxed in the corresponding
principles, it is important that it is kept essentially ﬁxed also here. This aspect makes
the generalized likelihood principle weaker than the principle as formulated in the
literature, in particular in Berger and Wolpert (1988). On the other hand, paradoxes
like what the ordinary likelihood principle seems to imply in the following situation
are avoided.
Example 3.7 Suppose that s1, s2, . . . are independent, identically (iid) distributed
variables with P(s = 1) = θ and P(s = 0) = 1−θ, i.e., iid Bernoulli variables with
parameter θ. In experiment E1, a ﬁxed sample size of ten observations is decided
upon, and the sufﬁcient statistic t1 = 10
i=1 si turns out to be t1 = 8. In experiment
E2, it is decided to take observations until a total of 2 zeroes has been observed. Then
assume that the sufﬁcient statistics t2 =  si also turns out to take the value 8. The
two likelihoods are proportional, but the contexts are different, so the intuition that
the two experiments may lead to different inference on θ is supported by my version
of the likelihood principle. For further discussion of this example, see Berger and
Wolpert (1988) and references there.
The introduction of a context makes my formulation of the likelihood principle
far less controversial than the ordinary formulation. According to the ordinary
principle, the way data are obtained is irrelevant to inference; all information
is contained in the likelihood. Thus sampling plans, randomization procedures,
and stopping rules are irrelevant according to a common interpretation of the
ordinary principle. Furthermore, common frequentist concepts like bias, conﬁdence
coefﬁcients, levels and powers of statistical tests, etc., are irrelevant, as they depend
on the sample space, not only on the observed observations. In my formulation,
all these concepts are related to the context. Also Bayesian priors, if needed, are
contained in the context. Maximum likelihood estimation cannot be derived from
the likelihood principle, but is obviously permissible as a method of obtaining
reasonable proposals for estimates in general.
An important special case of the generalized likelihood principle is when the
proportionality constant c is equal to 1. Then the two observations z∗
1 and z∗
2 have
equal likelihoods. Again an important special case is when the two experiments
are identical. A consequence of the generalized likelihood principle is then that
all experimental evidence, given the context, is a function of the likelihood of the
experiment, i.e., is contained in the likelihood function.

3.3
Prediction and Simple E-variables
Now look at situations with what I called in Chap. 1 simple e-variables. In most
statistical settings this corresponds to the area of prediction. So ﬁrst, let y be
an unknown e-variable (random variable) to be predicted, we have data z and a
statistical model for (z, y) depending on an unknown parameter η. The context is
denoted by τ. There are many situations where this is a relevant practical problem;
one situation is sketched at the end of Sect. 3.1.
Berger and Wolpert (1988) formulated a likelihood principle for prediction,
stating that all evidence about (y, η) is contained in the likelihood function
Lz(y, η|τ) = pη(y, z|τ).
(3.1)
In Bjørnstad (1990) predictive likelihood is reviewed, taking this as a point of
departure. The essential problem is that of eliminating η from (3.1) using one of
the following operations on Lz: integration, maximization, and conditioning. In
all, 14 different combinations of these operations were proposed, resulting in 14
different versions of what is called a predictive likelihood. In a statistical setting, it
is too much to demand that all evidence about θ is contained in such a predictive
likelihood.
The situation is completely different in quantum mechanics. Here, in a given
situation, we will have a model for the data z depending upon the context τ and the
e-variable of interest θ; see the example in Sect. 1.5.5. Thus, even though θ is simple,
from a statistical point of view it acts as a parameter in the model. An eventual extra
parameter η in such a model will be assumed known from earlier experiments of
the same type, and may be included in the context. This gives a unique likelihood
L(θ|z, τ) = p(z|τ, θ). And in this situation the whole discussion in Sect. 3.2 is
valid. In particular the generalized likelihood principle above holds true.
In simple quantum theory θ will be discrete. The situation will be taken up again
in Chap. 4.
3.4
Epistemic Processes, Decisions, and Actions
Recall that an epistemic process may result in a conﬁdence interval or a credibility
interval for the parameter θ. Also, recall that (cp. Sect. 2.1.1) in the present book we
support all 3 interpretations of the probability concept: The one based on symmetry,
the subjective interpretation, and the frequentist interpretation. The subjective
interpretation is relevant if the context contains a prior. The frequentist interpretation
is relevant if the epistemic process can be repeated an arbitrary number of times
with the same context. The ﬁrst case gives a credibility interval; the second case
a conﬁdence interval. An important case for us is when we have a prior which
is a right invariant measure of a transitive group, and the same group acts on the

58

Inference in an Epistemic Process
sample space. Then (Helland 2010, Corollary 3.6.2) the conﬁdence intervals and
the credibility intervals with the same coefﬁcient are numerically equal if they are
based on equivariant estimators (estimators which transform in the same way as the
corresponding parameters under the group).
Assume now that the epistemic process results in a 99% conﬁdence interval or
credibility interval [θ, ¯θ] for the parameter θ. Then the next step is an existential
choice, a decision: We claim that in the given context θ really belongs to the
interval [θ, ¯θ]. In this way a decision is always a part of the epistemic process.
This decision may be the basis for further decisions, for instance in the planning of
new experiments.
A special case is when θ is discrete. Then the interval may degenerate into a
single point θ. The epistemic decision may then be that θ really takes the value θ.
Similar kinds of decisions will be important in the second part of the book.
For those who know about hypothesis testing: A Neyman–Pearson hypothesis
testing situation may be taken as mathematically equivalent to a one-sided or two-
sided conﬁdence interval situation. Suppose that we want to test the null hypothesis
H0 : θ = θ0. Then the null hypothesis is rejected with the level α if and only if θ0
does not belong to a conﬁdence interval with coefﬁcient 1 −α.
Another decision type is a Fisherian p-value testing. In this case, a null
hypothesis and a direction of rejection are chosen as a part of the context. The result
of the decision is a p-value, 1 minus the conﬁdence coefﬁcient of the largest one-
sided conﬁdence interval not containing θ0.
Both in science and in everyday life, the epistemic process may be a part of
a larger process where a goal is formulated. The epistemic process itself may be
formal or informal. A great variety of decisions to act may result after an epistemic
process is carried out, and the result of this process is known.
A scientist who has gained some knowledge through an empirical process may
or may not decide to publish the results. The publishing process will involve several
minor decisions. In a similar way, any human being that has gained some knowledge
may decide to share his knowledge with other persons. But his newly gained
knowledge may also result in a wide variety of other decisions.
Every serious communication between human beings involves a complicated
interplay between epistemic processes and decisions together with other elements
like insights, reﬂections, and appreciations. In this interplay, the free will of each
individual involved plays an important role. Intuition is also important.
A group of persons may decide to go collectively into an epistemic process, and
to make collective decisions on how to act after the epistemic process is completed.
Each decision on how to act should be taken in an intelligent way, taking into
account the knowledge available. The time sequence will be important: First an
epistemic process, then a decision or a set of decisions, then actions and after that
perhaps new epistemic processes.
A person or a group of persons may decide explicitly to go into an epistemic
process before making a new important decision. The result of the epistemic process
will then be a part of the context of the important decision.

In general the result of an epistemic process may form part of the context for
new decisions or for other epistemic processes. The time span here may be short for
some decisions or epistemic processes; often longer for more important decisions
or epistemic processes.
In scientiﬁc decisions, it is always necessary to focus. Such focusing should be
done at every stage of the decision process. The focusing made when choosing the
epistemic question will play an important role in the second part of this book.
In the next part of the book, I will address quantum mechanics from an epistemic
point of view. A crucial concept is then that of an inaccessible conceptual variable,
that is, a conceptual variable for tentative use in an epistemic processes which cannot
be estimated with arbitrary accuracy by any experiment. In the regression model
where the dimension p by necessity is larger than the number n of observations, the
regression vector β must be seen as an inaccessible conceptual variable. However,
under suitable circumstances, the e-variable function βT x0 may still be estimable.
In particular this is the case when x0 is regarded as random, with the same
distribution as the other xi’s. One approach towards estimating this function may
be model reduction as discussed earlier.

Chapter 4
Towards Quantum Theory
Abstract Science is basically an endeavor for seeking some knowledge about the
world. In the previous chapters I have mostly concentrated on statistical inference
as a tool for obtaining such a knowledge. I will now turn to the second area
which I intend to cover in this book: Quantum theory, which I will also see
as a tool for obtaining knowledge of the world. Most of this chapter does not
presuppose any familiarity with the quantum formalism; my ambition is to derive
this foundation from reasonable assumptions. The basis is taken to be conceptual
variables, physical variables that may be accessible or inaccessible, i.e., it may
be possible or impossible to assign numerical values to them. In an epistemic
process, the accessible variables are just ideal potential observations connected to
an actor or to some communicating actors, what I earlier have called epistemic
conceptual variables or e-variables. Group actions are deﬁned on these variables,
and using group representation theory, this is the basis for developing the Hilbert
space formalism here. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables
are derived as a result of the approach, and in the discrete case it is argued from
the same approach that the possible values taken by the accessible conceptual
variables are the eigenvalues of these operators. The interpretation of quantum
states (or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions to
nature together with sharp answers to those questions. Orthogonal resolutions of the
identity are then connected to the relevant questions; these may be complementary
in the sense deﬁned by Bohr. Instead of entering the general derivation of these
results at once, I will ﬁrst give some background, and I will then develop the main
ideas in the case of a spin 1/2 particle, where less mathematics is required, before I
turn to the general theory.

Inaccessible Conceptual Variables and Quantum Theory
The statistical literature is full of discussions on how to do inference but contains
very little on the choice of question to do inference in some given situation.
These different questions may be conﬂicting, even complementary. In the following
sections I will formalize a way in which the discussion of such complementary
questions may be addressed in the extreme case where it is only possible to raise

one out of many different possible questions at a time. Each such question will be an
epistemic question “What will be the value of θ if I measure it?” for some e-variable
θ, and I will assume that the epistemic process ends by giving some information
about θ, in the simplest case a complete speciﬁcation: θ = uk.
The concept of an epistemic process is taken to be very wide in this book. In
addition to statistical questions concerning a parameter θ, we can also think of
situations like: Assume that one at a speciﬁc Saturday asks the question “How many
sun hours will there be here on Sunday?” At the outset, to address this epistemic
question will involve either consulting meteorological expertise or, if asked by the
experts themselves, a complex model and a lot of data from similar situations. But
on Sunday the question can be answered simply by counting the number of sun
hours. All these processes will be seen as epistemic processes.
However, when it comes to the parameters/e-variables of the epistemic processes,
I will make more speciﬁc assumptions. I will then take generalized experiments as
point of departure, that is, I assume that there in each setting exist data z and a
context τ such that the assumptions (1) and (2) of Sect. 3.2 are satisﬁed. For the
most part, z and τ will be implicit in the discussion, but they will be there. The
e-variables are also assumed to be associated with some actor (observer) or with a
group of communicating actors.
So far I have mostly assumed that each conceptual variable relevant to an
epistemic process is accessible, that is, it can be estimated or given a value with
arbitrary accuracy in some future experiment. In Helland (2006, 2008, 2010)
and in Chap. 1 here several situations with inaccessible conceptual variables were
described (see also below), and it was indicated that such situations in special
cases could form a link to important parts of quantum theory. I consider this way
of thinking to be essential as a step towards obtaining a uniﬁcation of epistemic
science, and also as an attempt to give an alternative background for the—from a
statistical point of view and also from the layman’s point of view—very formal
language that one ﬁnds in textbooks and in scientiﬁc publications, both within
quantum physics and in the mathematical traditions developed from this. In the
following sections a less formal approach will be presented. Compared to my earlier
publications, the discussion here will hopefully give both a simpler and a more
complete treatment of my approach towards quantum mechanics.
In statistics, the parameter concept is connected to a hypothetical population of
items. My e-variables are intended also for situations where we have a single item
or a few items, and a human subject or a group of subjects use these variables in
making statements about the item(s). This is crucial for my epistemic interpretation
of quantum mechanics, an interpretation that I also partly share with the Bayesian
quantum foundation school (QBism), see below.
The concept of an e-variable will be very important in this book. Recall that
it is any conceptual variable used in the epistemic process. In the same way as a
parameter in statistics is any property for an hypothetical population, an e-variable
can in principle be any property of a population, a single unit, or a group of units.
Like a parameter, it is a theoretical variable before the epistemic process, but after
the process the observer or the set of communicating observers in question have

4.1

some information about the value of the e-variable. An e-variable is a property
of a unit or a set of units as seen by an observer or a group of communicating
observers. A modern view of quantum theory and particle physics, see Kuhlmann
(2013), reduces everything to properties and relations.
Quantum theory has a long history starting with the work of several eminent
physicists in the beginning of the previous century, via the formalization made by
von Neumann (1932) to the rather intense debate on quantum foundation that we see
today. Several good books on quantum theory exist, for instance (Ballentine, 1998).
Interpretations of the theory have been given by many authors, but it has also been
argued that no interpretation is needed; see Fuchs and Peres (2000). Several authors
have derived quantum theory from a few explicit or implicit physical assumptions;
see Hardy (2001); Chiribella et al. (2010); Masanes (2010); Fields (2011); Fivel
(2012), and Casinelli and Lahti (2016). There is also a group of quantum foundation
researchers working towards a link with Bayesian inference; see Caves et al. (2002);
Schack (2006); Timpson (2008); Fuchs (2010); Fuchs and Schack (2011), and Fuchs
et al. (2013). The use of quantum information theory in the exploration of the
foundation has also recently proved to be very useful, see Fuchs (2002). The present
work has much in common with these schools, but I ﬁnd it fruitful to maintain a
broader link to statistics, in particular to allow a broader view on statistical inference
than just the Bayesian view. In this way I will argue for a foundation that is purely
epistemological: A general approach for achieving knowledge about the world.
The Bayesian interpretation can be seen as a special case of the general epistemic
interpretation, but I disagree with some of the assumptions made by the QBists; see
Chaps. 1 and 5.
As is well known, there is a long list of interpretations of quantum mechanics.
The Wikipedia entry “Interpretations of quantum mechanics” contains more than 16
interpretations: Copenhagen interpretation, quantum information theory, relational
quantum mechanics, quantum Bayesianism (QBism), many-world interpretation,
consistent histories, ensemble or statistical interpretation, de Broglie–Bohm theory,
quantum Darwinism, transactional interpretation, stochastic mechanics, objective
collapse theory, consciousness causes collapse (von Neumann–Wigner interpreta-
tion), quantum logic, modal interpretation, many minds interpretation, and so on.
It is obvious that this is a very unsatisfactory situation; one can even talk about
a crisis in modern physics. In my opinion, this situation can to a large extent be
explained by the very formal foundation that is given to quantum theory, both in
textbooks and in the scientiﬁc literature.
For an outsider, one of the really difﬁcult things to accept about quantum
mechanics is the state concept: The state of a system is given by a normalized
vector in a complex separable Hilbert space. In this chapter I will argue that this
state concept can be derived, or at least motivated, by other considerations. And I
will do this using group theory and group representation theory.
I start with the notion of conceptual variables, variables that the observer uses
to describe a physical system, like position, momentum, spin component, etc. All
these variables are accessible and can be measured by some experiment. But there
are also inaccessible conceptual variables, like the vector (position, momentum) or

64

Towards Quantum Theory
the spin vector. After some discussion of interpretations of quantum mechanics,
I introduce group actions on the conceptual variables. Using group representation
theory, I arrive at a formal apparatus that is essentially the same as the well known
quantum textbook apparatus. For instance, Theorem 4.4 below can be used as a
motivation for the statement that the values attained by a discrete conceptual variable
are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.
The resulting interpretation of the quantum formulation is a general epistemic
interpretation. I will also touch upon the concept of realism in this approach. What I
say is that when all observers agree about an observation, this should be considered
as a property of the real world. Thus I do not in any way deny that a real world
exists. What I mean is that our mind in some cases is not capable to ﬁnd a complete
objective state of this world, or even of chosen, focused aspects of the world.
After this, what will be the next step? One important step is to motivate the
probability rule of quantum theory, the Born rule. In Chap. 5 I will derive this rule
from 3 basic assumptions: (1) a quantum version of the likelihood principle, which
can be derived from a well known likelihood principle in statistical inference theory;
(2) an assumption that the observer has ideals that can be modeled by some ideal
being that is perfectly rational in a sense formulated by the Dutch book principle;
(3) an assumption that the state of the observer to start with is determined by a
maximally accessible conceptual variable.
For those who know quantum theory, one can talk about the 2 different processes
in this theory, the discontinuous Process 1 connected to observation and the
continuous Process 2 described by the Schrödinger equation. My opinion is that
Process 1, where the change of state is connected to an observation, thus must be
connected to a particular observer or to a group of communicating observers. I will
give more arguments for this statement later.
The recent article (Mermin, 2019) discusses this issue in detail. Mermin is also,
like me, very skeptical to the view on quantum mechanics held by most physicists.
“The absence of conceptual clarity for almost a century suggests that the problem
might lie in some implicit misconceptions about the nature of scientiﬁc explanation
that are deeply held by virtual all physicists, but are rarely explicitly acknowledged.”
Some other citations: “Much of the ambiguity and confusion of quantum
mechanics stems from an almost universal refusal to recognize that individual
personal experience is at the foundation of the story that each of us tells about the
world.”—“I build my understanding of the world I live in entirely out of my own
private personal experience.”
An important point is that, according to Mermin, “I” here can be replaced by
“you” or “Alice” or “Bob.” We all base our understanding of the world on our own
personal experience.
Unfortunately, Mermin ends up by a complete support of QBism. I do not follow
him here. My view on quantum theory is a general epistemic one, inspired by, but of
course different from, statistics. Subjective Bayesianism is only one out of several
possible foundational views on statistics, and I think that it should be equally so for
quantum theory. I will say that in general we simply do not base all our actions on
subjective bets, like the QBists do.

4.1
Inaccessible Conceptual Variables and Quantum Theory
65
To go back to the macroscopic situation, one case of an inaccessible conceptual
variable is in connection to counterfactual reasoning. Assume a single medical
patient and let the doctor have the choice between two mutually exclusive treat-
ments. Let θi be the time for this patient until recovery when treatment i is used
(i = 1, 2), and let φ = (θ1, θ2). Then, in some situations either θ1 or θ2 can
be predicted, and each of them can certainly be determined precisely after some
time period once some treatment is applied. But φ may be inaccessible in some
such settings, that is, there may be no procedure by which φ can be given a value
with arbitrary accuracy at any time for a single patient by the given medical doctor.
Certainly, he can assess the effect of both medicines in general from what he
knows before. But he is interested in one particular patient, which he has much
information about. This can be amended by instead of one patient considering larger
homogeneous groups of patients, and seeking information for such a group. Of
course this is just what is done in standard statistical investigations. But in practice
there is a limitation on how homogeneous a group of patients can be. And concepts
may be of interest for one single patient, too.
Here are two other examples of inaccessible conceptual variables:
•
We want to measure some quantity θ1 with a very accurate apparatus that is so
fragile that it is destroyed after a single measurement. There is another quantity
θ2 that can only be found by dismantling the apparatus, and then it cannot be
repaired. The vector φ = (θ1, θ2) is again inaccessible.
•
Assume that two questions are to be asked to a single individual at some given
moment and that we know that the answer will depend on the order in which
the questions are posed. Let the e-variable (θ1, θ2) be the answers when the
questions are posed in one order, and let the answers be (θ3, θ4) when the
questions are posed in the opposite order. Then the vector φ = (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) is
inaccessible.
Now go to the quantum mechanical situation. It is well known that the position
θ1 of a particle can be measured accurately in some experiments and its momentum
θ2 can be measured accurately in other experiments, but that the vector φ = (θ1, θ2)
is inaccessible. Similarly, the spin vector φ of a particle is inaccessible, but its
component θa in some ﬁxed, determined direction a is possible to measure in a
suitable experiment.
In general, let φ = (θ1, θ2) be inaccessible. Then different experimental settings
are needed to measure θ1 and θ2. In the words of Niels Bohr, the variables θ1 and
θ2, which I call e-variables, are complementary. The concept of complementarity
was crucial to Bohr, and it has been crucial to the foundation of quantum mechanics
even before its formal apparatus was developed. In the same way, the concept of an
inaccessible conceptual variable will be crucial in the further development of this
book.
From a statistical point of view: Inaccessible parameters also occur in linear
models of non-full rank, often used in the case of unbalanced data, cp. Searle
(1971), and in the analysis of designed experiments where only some contrasts can
be estimated. Also, in regression models where the number of variables by necessity

66
4
Towards Quantum Theory
is larger than the number of observations, the regression parameter must be seen as
an inaccessible parameter; see the end of Chap. 6. In my opinion a more complete
theory of statistical inference is deﬁnitely obtained if we allow for inaccessible
conceptual variables.
It is a crucial fact that the inaccessible conceptual variables φ are abstract
variables in some mathematical space and that operations such as group actions
may be made on this space. This is the case with the counterfactual example above,
where a group action such as a change of time scale can be made. See the summary
of group theory in Appendixes B and F. In general, let φ vary in a set Ωφ. Then
the group of automorphisms on Ωφ is the group of all possible transformations of
elements of Ωφ. This group always exists from a mathematical point of view. In
my approach below towards quantum mechanics, I may choose a ﬁxed subgroup K
of the group of automorphisms acting on the space Ωφ of inaccessible conceptual
variables. Other important groups are the groups Ga, where Ga corresponds to all
transformations of the values of θa = θa(φ) in the space ΩΘa. The groups Ga may
or may not be induced by K.
What is important to note, however, is that I will not regard the inaccessible
conceptual variables as physical variables, and they do not take concrete values,
so I am not developing a hidden variable theory of the kind that has been much
debated in the physical literature over the years. Also, the e-variables/parameters
are not hidden variables, but closely connected to the epistemic process. Note that
the parameters of statistics exist only in our minds.
Historically, an example of a hidden variable theory is David Bohm’s dual wave–
particle theory, and John Bell (see Bell 1987) proved that this theory is non-local.
In fact, Bell proved much more. His famous theorem states that any realistic theory
consistent with quantum mechanics must be non-local. This result has been very
important in discussions among physicists in recent years. Bell’s theorem is proved
using an extension of what is called the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen experiment and
Bell’s inequality, concepts that will be discussed later in this book. One point for
me here is that I do not want to develop a non-local theory, that is, a theory where
communication is made by signals traveling faster than the light speed. Then I am
instead forced to take a closer look upon the concept of realism. As I said above: My
view upon realism is that the real world exists, but our minds are not always able in
all situations to ﬁnd a complete, objective state of all the aspects of the world that
we want to focus on.
This issue has also been issued recently in a very convincing way by Nisticò and
Sestito (2011). In that paper they take as a point of departure the criterion of reality
as formulated to be (Einstein et al., 1935):
Criterion of Reality If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict
the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality
corresponding to this physical quantity.
Following arguments from Bohr’s discussion of Einstein et al. (1935) they make
the case for a strict interpretation of this criterion:

4.2
The Toy Model of Spekkens
67
Strict Interpretation To ascribe reality to P, the measurement of an observable
whose outcome would allow for the prediction of P must actually be performed.
Nisticò and Sestito (2011) go on and formulate an extension of quantum
correlation that is consistent with the strict interpretation, and using this they show
that Bell’s argument and several related arguments in the literature fail when realism
is interpreted in this strict way. Thus the possibility turns out to be open to interpret
the nonlocality theorems in the physical literature as arguments supporting the strict
criterion of reality, rather than as a violation of locality.
Since the present book is theoretical and not experimental, I will have to modify
Nisticò and Sestito’s requirement of strict interpretation slightly: “. . . a description
of how the measurement can be actually performed, must be given.” It is important
that my conceptual variables are thought of as deﬁned by one person or a group of
persons and to the experimental data that he/she/they are able to obtain.
In other papers, Bell’s theorem is interpreted as saying that quantum physics must
necessarily violate either the principle of locality or counterfactual deﬁniteness.
Counterfactual deﬁniteness is deﬁned as the ability to speak with meaning of
deﬁniteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability
to assure the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have
not been measured.) In this book it is crucial that I do not assume counterfactual
deﬁniteness. All my conceptual variables are assumed to be deﬁned by some
person(s), and these conceptual variables will not necessarily be such that results
of measurements not performed will have meaning. Here is a simple example: By
ﬁrst sight, one of the statements “I have something on my lap” and “I do not have
anything on my lap” must be true. But if I am standing, neither of these statements
are true. The logical status of statements must depend on the context.
In my formulation, I will look upon the accessible e-variables as variables
connected with experiment that actually can be imagined to be performed by some
person. This person will have a certain context for his experiment. It is possible
that another person, who has no communication with the ﬁrst one, has a different
context and uses different e-variables to formulate his observations, therefore getting
seemingly conﬂicting predictions. But as soon as communication is restored, there
must be no conﬂict any more. To make this precise: The two persons must then
make non-conﬂicting predictions if they agree on a common context, and they must
agree on observed results as long as they both have observed results.
In this chapter I will mostly assume perfect experiments, where I will not
distinguish between data and corresponding e-variables. I will come back to more
realistic experiments with data in later chapters.

The Toy Model of Spekkens
Nearly since its introduction in the beginning of the last century, discussions of
the interpretation of quantum mechanics have taken place. In particular, researchers
have disagreed on how the quantum state should be interpreted. Should it be seen

68

Towards Quantum Theory
as a real state of nature (the ontic view) or does it only represent our knowledge of
some focused aspect of nature (the epistemic view)? In my opinion, some synthesis
here should be sought, but one should start with an observer and the epistemic
process connected to this observer in his particular context. This will give an easy
interpretation of the collapse of the wave packet during measurement, and it will
also solve paradoxes like that of Schrödinger’s cat and that of Wigner’s friend.
These aspects will be brieﬂy discussed later in this chapter. The ontic interpretation
arises in my world view from a hypothetical situation where all potential observers
communicate and arrive at a common description of the situation.
As it stands now, however, the quantum community is divided. Recently there has
appeared in the literature certain no-go theorems that seem to support the ontic view.
All these theorems are deeply founded, but they rely on certain assumptions. Under
these assumptions they show that a pure epistemic view leads to inconsistencies.
In particular (Pusey et al., 2012) take as a point of departure a certain assumption
of separability. This is weakened by Hall (2011) to an assumption of compatibility.
Hardy (2012) introduced a different assumption of ontic indifference. The common
denominator of these papers is that they show that under the speciﬁc assumptions
the probability distribution over the ontic states corresponding to different quantum
states cannot overlap. See also my discussion of the PBR theorem in Sect. 1.4. A
crucial assumption is that all properties of the system can be deﬁned by some state
concept.
This last assumption is broken by the toy model of Spekkens (2007), which is
based on a principle that restricts the amount of knowledge an observer can have
about reality. A wide variety of quantum phenomena were found to have analogues
within this toy theory, and this can be taken as an argument in favor of the epistemic
view of quantum states.
In the simplest version of the toy model, we have one elementary system. This
system can be in one of the four ontic states 1, 2, 3, or 4, but our knowledge of this is
in principle restricted. We can only know one of the following six epistemic states:
(a) The ontic state is 1 or 2; (b) it is 3 or 4; (c) it is 1 or 3; (d) it is 2 or 4; (e) it is 1
or 4; or (f) it is 2 or 3. These are the epistemic states of maximal knowledge.
The ontic base of the state a) is {1, 2} etc. If the intersection of the ontic bases
of a pair of epistemic is empty, then those states are said to be disjoint. Thus (a)
and (b) are disjoint, (c) and (d) are disjoint, and (e) and (f) are disjoint. There is a
correspondence with certain basis vectors of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert
space, where disjointness corresponds to orthogonality in the Hilbert space. For
those who knows the Bloch sphere representation of that Hilbert space, the pairs
of disjoint epistemic states can be pictured on the intersections of three orthogonal
axes with that sphere.
Transformations of the epistemic states correspond to permutations of the
ontic state. Thus the underlying group is the permutation group of four symbols,
which has 24 elements. Each permutation induces a map between the epistemic
states. In the Hilbert space correspondence, the even permutations correspond
to unitary transformations, and the odd permutations correspond to antiunitary
transformations.

4.3
A Basic Development of the Main Ideas
69
In my terminology, the system can be described by an inaccessible conceptual
variable φ that is a vector whose three components are accessible e-variables:
φ = (λa, λc, λe).
Here λi is the indicator of the event that the epistemic state is i. Each λi takes the
value 1 or 0. If λa = 1, say, the ontic state is either 1 or 2; if λa = 0, it is either
3 or 4. A complete knowledge of φ is equivalent to a knowledge of the ontic state,
which is impossible in the Spekkens’ toy model. Each λi is a maximally accessible
e-variable.
The next simplest case of the Spekkens’ toy model consists of two elementary
systems. The main requirement from one system carries over: If one has maximal
knowledge, then for every system, at every time, the amount of knowledge one
possesses about the ontic state of the system at that time must equal the amount of
knowledge one lacks.
In my approach towards quantum theory I will rely on accessible and inaccessible
conceptual variables. Group actions will be imposed on these variables, and the
Hilbert space formulation will be derived by using group representation theory. All
this will lead to a basic epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics.

4.3.1
The Spin 1/2 Case
Many popular texts in quantum mechanics begin by discussing the spin 1/2 case,
the spin of an electron or a proton. In the formal quantum language this is described
by referring to a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space, and the state vectors
are normalized vectors in this space. Spin components in different directions are
measured, and each such spin component is represented by a self-adjoint operator.
The eigenvalues of the associated operator are the possible values of the component
in question, and the eigenvectors give the corresponding states. In general, physical
systems that can be modeled by using a two-dimensional Hilbert space are called
qubits.
In practical experiments to measure spin components, the electrical ﬁeld of the
electron or the proton will disturb the measurement, but one can use electrically
neutral silver atoms, which also have spin 1/2.
In my language, the spin vector of an electron, a proton, or a silver atom is
an inaccessible conceptual variable φ. But its component in any ﬁxed direction a,
that is, θa = ∥φ∥cos(a, φ), is accessible, an e-variable, as discussed in Chap. 1.
In particular, consider a Cartesian coordinate system and a silver atom going in
the y-direction. We can choose to measure the spin component in the x-direction
or in the z-direction, but not both. Then θx and θz are maximally accessible, or
complementary, e-variables.

70
4
Towards Quantum Theory
These components can take one of two possible values. For simplicity, I will from
now on normalize such that the possible values in each case are ±1.
Assume that we choose to measure the spin component θx in a perfect measure-
ment. (I will say more about measurements in the next subsection.) Then after the
measurement the particle is in one of the two states θx = +1 or θx = −1. One
might say that the state is composed of two parts: A question: “What is the value of
θx when measured?” and an answer: “θx = u.” This characterization of a state as a
question-and-answer pair will be fundamental in this book.
What if an observer should ask the question “What is the value of θz when
measured?” in this state. This is a legitimate question, but to any observer the answer
is “I do not know.” But assume that the observer performs the relevant perfect
measurement and obtains an answer “θz = v.” Then this deﬁnes a new state of
the particle.
In my view, the state of a physical system is always connected to an observer,
and it can nearly always be associated with a question-and-answerpair. More formal
arguments for this will be given in Sect. 4.5 below.
In all textbooks and in all the literature on quantum mechanics, the above
situation is described in a formal Hilbert space language. I will not go into detail
here, but the background for the discussion of the spin 1/2 case is a two-dimensional
complex Hilbert space. On this space there is deﬁned an operator Ax corresponding
to θx and another operator Az corresponding to θz. The operator Ax has eigenvalues
±1 and the corresponding normalized eigenvectors, written in Dirac’s notation,
|x+⟩and |x−⟩. Similarly, the operator Az has normalized eigenvectors |z+⟩and
|z−⟩. These eigenvectors deﬁne the states of the particle after measurements. Using
group theory and group representation theory I will give a general discussion of the
transition from my language to the formal Hilbert space language in Sect. 4.4.
A crucial assumption in (formal) quantum mechanics is the superposition
principle: If, say, |z+⟩and |z−⟩are possible states of the system, then b|z+⟩+c|z−⟩
(|b|2 + |c|2 = 1) is also a possible state of the system. In particular, for the spin 1/2
case, it is shown in Sect. 4.5 below that these superposed states are in one-to-one
correspondence with the possible eigenvectors of the operators Aa associated with
the spin components θa as the direction a varies.
Say that the particle is the state |x+⟩, that is, the spin component θx has been
measured to the ideal value +1. Then one can show the following relationship:
|x+⟩=
1
√
2
(|z−⟩+ |z+⟩).
(4.1)
From this, one can guess the probability distribution corresponding to a subsequent
measurement of θz: By symmetry, the subsequent states |z−⟩and |z+⟩are equally
probable, each having a probability 1/2. In general, such probabilities are calculated
by the Born rule, to be derived from reasonable assumptions in Chap. 5.

4.3.2
Measurements and the Statistical Paradigm
So far, I have assumed that all measurements are perfect. In practice there are
measurement errors, and in my opinion these should be modeled through statistical
models.
Assume that we have a beam of n silver atoms, all in a state determined by θx =
+1, and that we want to do some measurement on these particles. Our measurement
apparatus has an error rate given by ϵ, that is, when measuring some e-variable θ
that take the two values ±1, it gives the correct value θ0 with probability 1 −ϵ and
the opposite value |θ0| −θ0 −1 (recall that θ0 = ±1) with probability ϵ. These are
the data, and the number Y of correct values returned will be binomial B(n, 1 −ϵ).
Note that in this experiment θ0 itself will have a distribution, and this distribution
may be estimated from the data. Let λ = P(θ0 = +1) be estimated by Z/n, where
Z is the number of returned data values +1. The accuracy of this estimate may be
determined from the fact that Z is binomial B(n, λ(1 −ϵ) + (1 −λ)ϵ).
If θ = θ0 is considered as given, we may concentrate on a single particle i, and let
Xi be the indicator of the measurement +1 for this particle. Then P(Xi = 1) = 1−ϵ
if θ = +1, P(Xi = 1) = ϵ if θ = −1. Thus the data {Xi} have distributions
depending on the unknown e-variable θ. Of course we have Z = n
i=1 Xi, and the
Xi’s may be seen as independent.
Note that I in this example consider both θ and λ as e-variables. The ﬁrst one has
a distribution and is connected to some given particle, the second one has a ﬁxed
value, but both may be seen as variables that are unknown before the experiment
starts. If θ is some spin component θa, I will in Chap. 5 derive a formula for λ
under assumptions related to the truth of quantum mechanics and corresponding
to the perfect case ϵ = 0. But in real experiments one must take into account the
possibility that the measurement apparatus is not accurate.
In general, in a quantum experiment, one might want to estimate an e-variable
θ, and the measurement apparatus is inaccurate. The data returned are given by z,
and the statistical model describing the apparatus is of the form p(z|θ, τ), where τ
gives the context of the experiment. Then in my opinion, the whole theory given in
Chaps. 2 and 3 can be used in analyzing this experiment.
4.3.3
Entangled States
Up to now I have mostly described one component of the spin vector of a particle;
in general we might be interested in, say, d such components on d particles at the
same time. In formal quantum language, this is modeled by writing states as tensor
products, for instance
|1+⟩|2+⟩. . .|d+⟩= |1+⟩⊗|2+⟩⊗. . . ⊗|d+⟩.
(4.2)

72

Towards Quantum Theory
In my language this corresponds to a multiple question “What are the values of
θ1, θ2, . . . , θd?” together with the sharp answer θ1 = θ2 = . . . = θd = +1. Quite
recently, it has been proved rigorously by Höhn (2017a,b), and Höhn and Wever
(2017) that for sets of qubits there is a one-to-one correspondence between multiple
question-and-answer pairs on the one hand and formal quantum states on the other
hand.
Similarly as in the single qubit case, linear combinations of state vectors of the
form (4.2) are also permissible state vectors. If such a linear combination cannot
be reduced to a form similar to (4.2), it is called an entangled state. Very many
strange quantum phenomena are connected to entangled states, and these are much
discussed in the literature.
As an example, consider two particles 1 and 2 that previously have been
connected into one particle of total spin 0. One can then show that the joint state
vector of the two particles then is given by
|Ψ ⟩=
1
√
2
(|1+⟩|2−⟩−|1−⟩|2+⟩).
(4.3)
Again, in my language this state is described by φ1 = −φ2, where φ1 and φ2 are
the spin vectors of the two particles. This statement is accessible, even though the
vectors φ1 and φ2 are inaccessible.
In much of the literature, the state (4.3) is set in a context where particle 1 is
observed by an observer Alice, particle 2 is observed by an observer Bob, and at the
moment of measurement Alice and Bob are so far from each other that they cannot
communicate, a spacelike separation in the language of special relativity theory.
This is the basis for the famous Bell experiment, an experiment that will be further
discussed in the next chapter.
4.3.4
Relative States and Many Worlds
Everett (1957) was worried about the measurement problem; see also Barrett (2014).
Brieﬂy: If we during measurement consider only the physical system, this system
experiences a discontinuous change of state. But the entangled state consisting of
system plus observer can be considered to have a continuous change of state that
can be described by the Schrödinger equation. How can this be reconciled? Everett
proposed a simple solution in terms of his relative state concept.
Let the physical system be a spin 1/2 particle, measured in the z-direction. This
gives two possible states |+⟩and |−⟩. Having observed this, the observer can be
considered to be correspondingly in the states |O+⟩or |O−⟩. Let us assume that
the system starts in a superposed state
|S⟩= a|+⟩+ b|−⟩.
(4.4)

4.3
A Basic Development of the Main Ideas
73
Let |R⟩be the state of the observer indicating that he is ready to observe. The
whole thing system + observer is then before the measurement in the state
|Ψ1⟩= a|+⟩|R⟩+ b|−⟩|R⟩,
(4.5)
and after the measurement in the entangled state
|Ψ2⟩= a|+⟩|O+⟩+ b|−⟩|O−⟩.
(4.6)
Note that |Ψ2⟩is not a state where the spin operator corresponding to z-
measurement has a particular eigenvalue. According to the standard collapse theory,
somehow during measurement the state of the composite system will collapse to
precisely one of the following two states:
|+⟩|O+⟩or |−⟩|O−⟩,
(4.7)
and the state of the subsystem connected to the particle provides the eigenvalue
needed to account for the measurement.
Everett (1957) proposed a different solution. According to him, it is meaningless
to ask for the absolute state of a subsystem—one can only ask for the state relative
to a given state of the remainder of the whole system. The resulting theory is
the relative state formulation of quantum mechanics. Central to this theory is the
distinction between absolute and relative states.
In the absolute state |Ψ2⟩the observer has no determinate measurement record,
and the particle has no determinate spin component in the z-direction. One might
say that the observer has two values in his mind at the same time. But in this state,
the observer gives the record “z-spin up” relative to the particle being in the z-spin
up state, and he has recorded “z-spin down” relative to the particle being in the
z-spin down state.
DeWitt and Graham (1973), in an attempt to make this idea a little more concrete,
proposed their many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation
has become the most popular understanding of Everett’s theory, but Everett himself
was skeptical to this.
In op.cit. the many-world interpretation is explained in terms of the Schrödinger’s
cat paradox. The cat is either alive or dead, and together with its physical
environment it is in entangled state similar to (4.6). According to the many-world
interpretation the cat is pictured as inhibiting two simultaneous, non-interacting,
but equally real world. When a measurement is performed, one of these worlds is
selected. Similarly, each measurement on any system results in a selection of a world
from a large number of possible worlds. To account for all the measurements that
are being done, this number must be really large, a point that in my mind makes the
many-world theory very strange.

74

Towards Quantum Theory
4.3.5
Convivial Solipsism
In my opinion, a far more reasonable concretization of Everett’s idea is given in
Hervé Zwirn’s recently proposed convivial solipsism, a philosophy aiming at giving
a completely new interpretation of quantum theory, an interpretation related to
several other interpretations, but going much deeper into the relationship between
the observer and the physical system.
Solipsism is a philosophy with many variants; in its basic version it claims that
my mind cannot be sure of anything else than what is in this mind. To me, my
mind is the whole world. Convivial solipsism adds to this claim that also other
people have their minds, their worlds, and that different people can communicate on
certain questions. After two (or more) observers/agents have been in communication
on certain questions, they can together form a new unit, a new world with respect
to these questions. In this way, humans form groups, and there is an underlying
agreement within the group on certain questions.
Note that this philosophy is not in any way limited to the microworld. From a
macropoint of view it may seem to give a valid description of at least some aspects
of humans and of human societies.
But the purpose of Zwirn (2016, 2020) has been to use convivial solipsism to
explain certain quantum phenomena. The quantum philosophy of Zwirn relies on
two postulates: the hanging-on mechanism and the relativity of states. The last
postulate only assumes that every state is relative to an observer and is similar to
an assumption made in QBism and in Rovelli’s relational interpretation. This is also
the relative state postulated by Everett. The hanging-on mechanism requires a little
more explanation.
Zwirn (2016) gives two explanations of the hanging-on mechanism: A more
accurate one taking into account the environment and relying upon the phenomenon
of decoherence, and a simpler one neglecting the environment. I will stick to the
simplest explanation here. For simplicity I will ﬁrst also include the measurement
apparatus in the physical system under investigation.
Look again at the entangled state (4.6). This is a pure state, and as such it
describes a maximally accessible situation in my language. In general, a pure state
is associated with a question (“What is θ?”) together with a sharp answer (“θ = uk”
say) for a maximally accessible conceptual variable θ, and this is all information
that can be achieved in this state.
An entangled pure state like (4.6) has a more complicated interpretation. Look
ﬁrst at the interpretation of the tensor products |+⟩|O+⟩and |−⟩|O−⟩. Both can
be seen as answers to the same question: “What is the spin component and what
is the perception of this spin component in the observer’s head?” But then any
superposition of these states must be associated with the same question. If both a
and b are different from 0, then the answer is “I don’t know.” Epistemic probabilities
may be given to the two alternatives from Born’s formula. Here I will only consider
the case a = ±b = ±1/
√
2. Then by symmetry, each probability must be 1/2.

4.3
A Basic Development of the Main Ideas
75
Then Zwirn makes a fundamental statement: A measurement is not a measure-
ment before the result is received by the conscience of the observer. Here there are
two possibilities: A: a spin component + is made conscious by the observer; B:
a spin component −is made conscious by the observer. According to Zwirn, the
statements A and B should be distinguished from the states |O+⟩and |O−⟩, which
only describe some physical states of the observer’s brain.
The hanging-on principle then states that A or B is preserved, in the sense that
any further measurements, and any further decisions made by the observer, will have
to take these records into account.
A personal remark here. The whole quantum literature assumes perfect measure-
ments, no measurement error. A statistician will regard these perfect measurements
as parameters θ and model the data z by a statistical model p(z|θ). He will then
translate A to the statement: “From the data z I infer that θ = +1,” and translate
B to the statement “From the data z I infer that θ = −1.” To take into account the
uncertainty connected to this inference, one will have to extend quantum theory to
include a measurement theory. I will come back to that later.
4.3.6
The EPR Experiment
Here I describe Bohm’s version of the famous Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR)
experiment and interpret this experiment in terms of convivial solipsism.
Look at the total spin component for a system of two spin 1/2 particles. Assume
that we have such a system where the state is such that the total spin is zero. By
ordinary quantum mechanical calculations, this state can be explicitly written as
|Ψ ⟩in (4.3), where |1+⟩|2−⟩is a state where particle 1 has a spin component
+1 and particle 2 has a spin component −1 along the z-axis, and vice versa for
|1−⟩|2+⟩. This is an entangled state, that is, a state that is not a direct product of
the component state vectors. However, I will ﬁrst discuss this while sticking to my
e-variable description.
Assume further that the two particles separate, the spin component of particle 1 is
measured in some direction by an observer Alice, and the spin component of particle
2 is measured by an observer Bob. Before the experiment, the two observers agree
both to measure spin in the z-direction, the measurements assumed for simplicity to
be perfect. As a ﬁnal assumption, let the positions of the two observers at the time
of measurement be spacelike, that is, the distance between them is so large that no
signal can reach from one to the other at this time, taking into account that signals
cannot go faster than the speed of light by the theory of relativity.
This is Bohm’s version of the situation behind the argument against the com-
pleteness of quantum mechanics as posed by Einstein et al. (1935) and countered by
Bohr (1935a,b). This discussion is still vigorous in the quantum literature today,
although most physicists now support Bohr on the question of completeness of
quantum mechanics.

76
4
Towards Quantum Theory
I will be very brief on this discussion here. Let θ be the spin component as
measured by Alice, and let η be the spin component as measured by Bob. Alice
has a probability 1/2 for each of θ = ±1. If she measures θ = +1, say, she will
predict η = −1 for the corresponding component measured by Bob. According to
Einstein et al. (1935) there should then be an element of reality corresponding to
this prediction, but if we adapt the strict interpretation of Sect. 4.1 here, there is no
way in which Alice can predict Bob’s actual real measurement at this point of time.
Bob on his side also has the probability 1/2 for each of η = ±1. The variables θ and
η are conceptual, the ﬁrst one connected to Alice and the second one connected to
Bob. As long as the two are not able to communicate, there is no sense in which we
can make statements like η = −θ meaningful. We imagine that such an experiment
is run many times.
The situation changes, however, if Alice and Bob meet at some time after the
measurement. There is a subtle distinction here, and this distinction is discussed in
detail in the paper (Zwirn, 2016); see also Zwirn (2020).
This EPR experiment has caused much discussion in the physical literature. It
has recently been asserted (Kupczynski, 2017) that the debate between Bohr and
Einstein on the completeness of quantum mechanics should not be closed. Several
researchers have also claimed that this experiment shows that quantum mechanics
must be non-local: If Alice measures θ = +1, then seemingly it is immediately
implied that η = −1 on Bob’s side.
Let us see how these questions may be approached using the convivial solipsism
philosophy of Zwirn (2016). According to this philosophy, the total state of the
whole system after both measurements, including both Alice’s and Bob’s brain
registrations, is
|Ψ0⟩=
1
√
2
(|1+⟩|α+⟩|2−⟩|β−⟩−|1−⟩|α−⟩|2+⟩|β+⟩).
(4.8)
Here |α±⟩refers to the brain of Alice, while |β±⟩refers to the brain of Bob.
Following Zwirn and Everett, this total state has no physical meaning in the sense
that it is not related to any observer. Only the relative states of subsystems have
meaning. Also, following Zwirn, one must sharply distinguish between |α+⟩, say,
and the conscious comprehension by Alice “The spin component in the z-direction
is +1.” This conscious comprehension may be called A+, and the result of this
comprehension is kept for any future measurement, decision or action. By Zwirn,
this is called the hanging-on mechanism and is one of the two basic postulates
behind his convivial solipsism. The other postulate is the relativity of states, an
assumption shared by Everett, Rovelli, and the QBist school.
According to Zwirn, a measurement is not a measurement before the result
is conceived consciously by some observer. And any relation involving physical
variables cannot be said to be a relation until it is measured by some observer. In
this way, the observer—or group of communicating observers—is of fundamental
importance.

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
77
Again according to Zwirn, any later communication between Alice and Bob must
be seen as a new measurement process. It is only when Alice later asks Bob which
value he found that she performs a measurement on Bob and learns the result he
got on his particle. Let us say that Alice has experienced the observation +1 on
her particle. According to the hanging-on mechanism, she will necessarily hear −1
because she is hung-on to the branch that is linked to this result in agreement with
her own measurement on the ﬁrst particle. But, and that is an important point, in
convivial solipsism this does not mean that the second particle “was already before”
in the state −1. Before she asks Bob, Alice is in the state “don’t know” concerning
the spin component of Bob’s particle. And similarly, Bob does not know anything
about Alice’s particle until he asks her. There is nothing here except observers,
their measurements, and their knowledge. There is no “spooky instantaneous at a
distance.”
Now I could have gone on and discussed Bell’s theorem and the Bell experiment,
where Alice and Bob both are free to choose their settings. However, I will come
back to a brief discussion of this experiment in Chap. 5. Instead I will turn now
to two important questions: (1) Can the formal quantum language—at least under
some conditions—be derived from my language, using accessible and inaccessible
conceptual variables? The answer turns out to be yes, and in the derivation I am
going to use some group theory and group representation theory. (2) To what
extent can one postulate a correspondence between formal quantum states and my
question-and-answer pairs? Again the answer to this turns out to be positive, at least
under certain circumstances. In the rest of this book I will concentrate on situations
where such a correspondence can be established.
4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
4.4.1
Introduction
For an outsider, one of the really difﬁcult things to accept about quantum mechanics
is its state concept: The state of a physical system is given by a normalized vector
in a complex separable Hilbert space. One question that I will raise here is whether
this state concept can be derived, or at least motivated, by some other considerations.
And I will try to answer this by using group theory and group representation theory.
The point of departure will be the notion of conceptual variables, physical
variables attached to some observer. For instance according to relational quantum
mechanics, see Rovelli (1996) and von Fraassen (2010), variables take values only
at interactions, and the values that they take are only relative to the other system
affected by the interaction. This other system might well be an observer, and I will
think of such a situation.
One purpose of this book is to propose a common basis for statistical inference
theory and quantum theory. To achieve this, it is crucial to take a deﬁnition

78
4
Towards Quantum Theory
of a conceptual variable as a point of departure. For this purpose a conceptual
variable is any variable that can be deﬁned in words by a person or by a group
of persons in an experimental or observational situation, or more generally in any
epistemic process. Behind this deﬁnition of conceptual variables there also lies an
interpretation of quantum theory where the observer plays an essential role. Some
conceptual variables are inaccessible, meaning that they cannot be assessed with
full accuracy by any observer. An example can be a spin or angular momentum
vector of some particle. Another example is the vector (position, momentum) for a
particle. However, some functions of inaccessible variables can be measured, and
these functions are called e-variables (epistemic conceptual variables). Part of the
philosophy of the book is that the e-variables are closely related to the parameters
of statistical inference; these parameters can be modeled as they are in statistical
inference theory when data are present.
In the following discussion, I may also partly have in mind other situations
than epistemic processes. In these cases a conceptual variable is any variable that
can be deﬁned by a person or by a group of communicating persons. Some such
variables only have meaning for this speciﬁc group of people and thus cannot be
generalized. Some do not have a precise meaning at all in their given context, in the
sense that their components are mutually exclusive. These variables may tentatively
be called inaccessible. The accessible variables are then less ambitious conceptual
variables that can be precisely deﬁned, at least to the group of people that deﬁne
them. These notions are by necessity a bit vague. For more concrete ideas, look at
the qualitative discussion of complementarity in Chap.7. Those who prefer so may
limit the discussion below to the epistemic process case.
However, in a more general context the notions of focusing and decisions are
very important. These notions are used in statistical theory, but they should here be
interpreted in their primitive sense.
It is crucial in my context here that I assume that there are deﬁned transformation
groups on the spaces of conceptual variables that are discussed. This may be the
group of all automorphisms on the space in which the conceptual variable varies, or
it may be a concrete subgroup of this group.
To avoid misunderstandings, I do not claim that my derivations should replace
completely the deep investigations recently on deriving the Hilbert space structure
from physical assumptions (Hardy, 2001; Chiribella et al., 2016; Goyal, 2008;
Masanes and Müller, 2011). By relying on group representation theory, I use at the
outset some Hilbert space structure. But this is by construction, not by assumption.
It is interesting to see, as is stated in Chiribella et al. (2019), that there is a problem
connecting the above general derivations to the many different interpretations of
quantum theory. By contrast, the derivation presented here seems to lead to a
particular interpretation: A general epistemic interpretation. This interpretation is
also elaborated on elsewhere in this book.
Note that in quantum ﬁeld theory and particle physics theory, the use of group
representation theory is crucial (Robinson, 2011).
In this section I discuss these notions more closely with a focus on the more
mathematical aspects of the situations described above. I assume the existence of

a concrete (physical) situation and that there is a space Ωφ of an inaccessible
conceptual variable φ with a transitive group K acting on this space. There is at
least one accessible conceptual variable, θ deﬁned, a function on Ωφ. This θ varies
on a space Ωθ, and the group K may or may not induce a transformation group G
on Ωθ. In any case I will focus on such a group G on Ωθ, whether it is induced by
K or not. When G is induced by K, one can prove that G is transitive on Ωθ.
A special situation is when φ is a spin vector, and θ is a spin component in a
given direction. In the simple spin situation the natural group K for the spin vector
does not directly induce groups on the components.
When there are several potential accessible variables, I will denote this by a
superscript a: θa and Ga = {ga}. I use the word “group” as synonymous to “group
action” or transformation group on some set, not as an abstract group.
4.4.2
A Summary of the Mathematical Results Obtained Below
My main result is given in Sect. 4.4.4 below (Theorem 4.3 there). Consider a
situation with several accessible conceptual variables (e-variables in an epistemic
setting), where two of these are maximally accessible. Then under weak technical
assumptions the following holds: There is a Hilbert space describing the situation,
and to each accessible variable there corresponds a unique operator on this Hilbert
space.
This result has relevance for at least two different epistemic settings: (1) There
is a single actor or observer in the situation. This actor is planning to do a
measurement, and in that connection he has several e-variables in his mind, two
of which are maximally accessible. (2) A group of communicating observers are
planning to do an experiment or measurement. Together they have formulated
possible experimental questions, and two of these questions (which each may
consist of several sub-questions) are complementary, in the sense that they involve
different, maximally accessible conceptual variables.
The operators constructed in this way have several attractive properties. In the
case where an e-variable takes a countable of a ﬁnite number of values, these
are under quite general assumptions equal to the eigenvalues of the corresponding
operator (Theorem 4.4). Also, the e-variable is maximally accessible if and only if
all eigenspaces of the operator are one-dimensional (Theorem 4.5). In the maximal
case the operators have a spectral decomposition of the form (4.33), in general case
of the form (4.34). It is very important that these properties are derived as results of
relatively weak assumptions, not stated as “self-evident” axioms. The assumptions
may be realized in what I call a general epistemic interpretation of quantum theory.
The theory is illustrated on two important cases: The case of spin/angular
momentum components of a particle, and the case where the maximal e-variables
are position and momentum of a particle. Also, it is shown to be relevant to
Spekkens’ toy model.

Towards Quantum Theory
An important consequence of the theory is related to the eigenspaces of the
operators corresponding to some set of e-variables. These eigenspaces can be
interpreted as equivalent to questions “What will be the value of this particular
e-variable if I measure it?” together with a sharp answer given by the relevant
eigenvalue. In the case of maximally accessible e-variables, this gives a concrete
interpretation of eigenvectors.
Every state vector in a given Hilbert space can trivially be seen as an eigenvector
of many operators. We may assume that there is one such operator that (1) has a
physical interpretation, that is, in my language can be connected to an e-variable;
(2) has only one-dimensional eigenspaces. If this is the case, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the set of state vectors and the set of question-and-answer
pairs as formulated above.
In general, let us consider a set of e-variables {θa; a ∈A } in some context. A
question-and-answer pair is equivalent to an indicator I(θa = uk). By the theory
of this chapter, to each θa there corresponds a unique operator Aa, given some
weak conditions, including the existence of two maximally accessible variables
in the given set. And to each operator, there is a set of eigenvalues, which are
the possible values of the relevant e-variable, and each eigenvalue is in one-
to-one correspondence with an eigenvector in the maximal case. Thus, there is
mapping from the indicators—equivalently the question-and-answer pairs—to the
unit vectors (disregarding phase) of the given Hilbert space. A general problem is
to ﬁnd conditions under which this mapping can be inverted. This—given some
additional arguments—was posed as an open problem to the quantum society in
Helland (2019b).
4.4.3
Basic Setting
In Chapter 3 of Helland (2010) righthand notation is used for group transformations:
φ →φk for k ∈K and θ →θg for g ∈G. This allows right invariant measures
to be deﬁned in a simple way and also has the following simple advantage: If g1 is
applied ﬁrst to Ωθ followed by g2, then the composed transformation is g1g2, rather
than g2g1. However, in this section I will need the left invariant measure, so I will
use the more familiar notation: φ →kφ[= k(φ)] and θ →gθ.
Starting with Ωφ and the group K acting on Ωφ, let θ(·) be a function on Ωφ,
and let Ωθ be the range of this function.
As discussed in the Introduction, I regard “accessible” and “inaccessible” as
primitive notions. Ωθ and Ωφ are equipped with topologies, and all functions are
assumed to be Borel-measurable.
Deﬁnition 4.1 The e-variable θ is maximally accessible if the following holds: If θ
can be written as θ = f (ψ) for a function f that is not one-to-one, the conceptual
variable ψ, if it is associated with the same context, is not accessible. In other words:
θ is maximal under the partial ordering deﬁned in a given context by α ≤β iff
α = f (β) for some function f .

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
81
Note that this partial ordering is consistent with accessibility: If β is accessible
and α = f (β), then α is accessible. Also, φ is an upper bound under this partial
ordering. The existence of maximal accessible conceptual variables follows then
from Zorn’s lemma.
Deﬁnition 4.2 The e-variable θ is called permissible if the following holds:
θ(φ1) = θ(φ2) implies θ(kφ1) = θ(kφ2) for all k ∈K.
With respect to parameters and subparameters along with their estimation, the
concept of permissibility is discussed in some detail in Chap.3 in Helland (2010).
The main conclusion, which can also be generalized to this setting, is that under the
assumption of permissibility one can deﬁne a group G of actions on Ωθ such that
(gθ)(φ) := θ(kφ); k ∈K.
(4.9)
Herein I use different notations for the group actions g on Ωθ and the group
actions k on Ωφ; in contrast, the same symbol g was used in Helland (2010). The
background for that is:
Lemma 4.1 Assume that θ is a permissible e-variable. The function from K to G
deﬁned by (4.9) is then a group homomorphism.
Proof Let ki be mapped upon gi by (4.9) for i = 1, 2. Then, for all φ ∈Ωφ we have
(giθ)(φ) = θ(kiφ). Assume that k2φ is mapped to θ′ = θ(k2φ) = (g2θ)(φ). Then
also θ(k1k2φ) = (g1θ′)(k2φ) = (gθ)(φ) for some g. Thus (g1(g2θ))(φ) = (gθ)(φ)
for all φ, and since the mapping is permissible, we must have g = g1g2.
⊓⊔
In the statistical context of parameters and subparameters, the concept of
permissibility is connected to several deep problems, as brieﬂy discussed in Helland
(2010). First, one should mention the general categorical theory-based requirements
for statistical models in McCullagh (2002). These considerations can be special-
ized to the group theory case, and then this concept of permissibility becomes
crucial. Next, under transitivity and other week assumptions the requirement of
permissibility implies that Bayesian credibility sets based on a right invariant prior
and frequentist conﬁdence sets are numerically equal. Finally, the assumption of
permissibility and the use of a right invariant prior turn out to be enough to eliminate
the marginalization paradoxes of Dawid et al. (1973), along with some similar
inconsistencies, see Helland (2002).
In the more general context considered here, it is also important to deﬁne left-
and right invariant measures, both on the groups and on the spaces of conceptual
variables. In the mathematical literature, see for instance (Nachbin, 1965) or (Hewitt
and Ross, 1970), Haar measures on the groups are deﬁned (assuming locally
compact groups). Right (μK) and left (νK) Haar measures on the group K satisfy
μK(Dk) = μK(D), and νK(kD) = νK(D)
for k ∈K and D ⊂K, respectively.

82

Towards Quantum Theory
Next deﬁne the corresponding measures on Ωφ. As is commonly done, I assume
that the group operations (k1, k2) →k1k2, (k1, k2) →k2k1 and k →k−1 are
continuous. Furthermore, I will assume that the action (k, φ) →kφ is continuous.
As discussed in Wijsman (1990), an additional condition is that every inverse
image of compact sets under the function (k, φ) →(kφ, φ) should be compact. A
continuous action by a group K on a space Ωφ satisfying this condition is called
proper. This technical condition turns out to have useful properties and is assumed
throughout this section. When the group action is proper, the orbits of the group can
be proved to be closed sets relative to the topology of Ωφ.
The connection between νK deﬁned on K and the corresponding left invariant
measure ν deﬁned on Ωφ is relatively simple: If for some ﬁxed value φ0 of the
conceptual variable the function β on K is deﬁned by β : k →kφ0, then
ν(E) = νK(β−1(E)).This connection between νK and ν can also be written
νK(dk) = dν(kφ0)), so that dν(hkφ0) = dν(kφ0) for all h, k ∈K.
The following result, originally due to Weil, is proved in Wijsman (1990); for
more details on the right invariant case, see also Helland (2010).
Theorem 4.1 The left invariant measure ν on Ωφ exists if the action of K on Ωφ is
proper and the group is locally compact.
Note that ν can be seen as an induced measure on each orbit of K on Ωφ, and it
can be arbitrarily normalized on each orbit. ν is ﬁnite on a given orbit if and only
if the orbit is compact. In particular, ν can be deﬁned as a probability measure on
Ωφ if and only if all orbits of Ωφ are compact. Furthermore, ν is unique only if the
group action is transitive.
In a corresponding fashion, a right invariant measure can be deﬁned on Ωφ. This
measure satisﬁes dμ(khφ0) = dμ(kφ0) for all k, h ∈K. In many cases the left
invariant measure and the right invariant measure are equal.
4.4.4
Operators and their Properties
In the context deﬁned above, θ = θ(φ) is an accessible variable, and one should
be able to introduce an operator associated with θ. The following discussion
that is partly inspired by Bargeron et al. (2018) considers an irreducible unitary
representation of K on a complex Hilbert space K .
A Brief Discussion of Group Representation Theory
A group representation of K is a continuous homomorphism from K to the group
of invertible linear operators V on some vector space K :
V (k1k2) = V (k1)V (k2).
(4.10)

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
83
It is also required that V (e) = I, where I is the identity, and e is the unit element
of K. This assures that the inverse exists: V (k)−1 = V (k−1). The representation is
unitary if the operators are unitary (V (k)†V (k) = I). If the vector space is ﬁnite-
dimensional, we have a representation D(V ) on the square, invertible matrices. For
any representation V and any ﬁxed invertible operator U on the vector space, we
can deﬁne a new equivalent representation as W(k) = UV (k)U−1. One can prove
that two equivalent unitary representations are unitarily equivalent; thus U can be
chosen as a unitary operator.
A subspace K1 of K is called invariant with respect to the representation V if
u ∈K1 implies V (k)u ∈K1 for all k ∈K. The null-space {0} and the whole
space K are trivially invariant; other invariant subspaces are called proper. A group
representation V of a group K in K is called irreducible if it has no proper invariant
subspace. A representation is said to be fully reducible if it can be expressed
as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations. A ﬁnite-dimensional unitary
representation of any group is fully reducible. In terms of a matrix representation,
this means that we can always ﬁnd a W(k) = UV (k)U−1 such that D(W) is of
minimal block diagonal form. Each one of these blocks represents an irreducible
representation, and they are all one-dimensional if and only if K is Abelian. The
blocks may be seen as operators on subspaces of the original vector space, i.e.,
the irreducible subspaces. The blocks are important in studying the structure of the
group.
A useful result is Schur’s Lemma (see for instance (Barut and Raczka, 1985)):
Let V1 and V2 be two irreducible representations of a group K; V1 on the space
K1 and V2 on the space K2. Suppose that there exists a linear map T from K1 to
K2 such that
V2(k)T |u⟩= T V1(k)|u⟩
(4.11)
for all k ∈K and |u⟩∈K1.
Then either T is zero or it is a linear isomorphism. Furthermore, if K1 = K2,
then T = λI for some complex number λ.
Let ν be the left invariant measure of the space Ωφ induced by the group K, and
consider the Hilbert space K = L2(Ωφ, ν). Then the left regular representation of
K on K is deﬁned by UL(k)f (φ) = f (k−1φ). This representation always exists,
and it can be shown to be unitary, see Barut and Raczka (1985).
If V is an arbitrary representation of a compact group K in K , then there exists
in K a new scalar product deﬁning a norm equivalent to the initial one, relative to
which V is a unitary representation of K.
For references to some of the vast literature on group representation theory, see
Appendix A.2.4 in Helland (2010).

Towards Quantum Theory
A Resolution of the Identity
In the following I assume that the group K (and later also the groups G and H) has
representations that give square-integrable coherent state systems (see page 43 of
Perelomov (1986)). For instance this is the case for all representations of compact
semisimple groups, representations of discrete series for real semisimple groups,
and some representations of solvable Lie groups.
Let K be an arbitrary such group, and let V (k) be one of its unitary irreducible
representations acting on the Hilbert space K . Assume that K is acting transitively
on a space Ωφ, and ﬁx φ0 ∈Ωφ. Then every φ ∈Ωφ can be written as φ = kφ0 for
some k ∈K.
Also, ﬁx a vector |φ0⟩∈K , and deﬁne the coherent states |φ⟩= |φ(k)⟩=
V (k)|φ0⟩. With ν being the left invariant measure on Ωφ, introduce the operator
T =

|φ(k)⟩⟨φ(k)|dν(kφ0).
(4.12)
Note that the measure here is over Ωφ, but the elements are parametrized by K.
Remark Here and in the following, I will for simplicity disregard the fact that
vectors that differ only by a phase factor should be identiﬁed as representing the
same state, where the state concept will be discussed later. For a more rigorous
presentation, see Perelomov (1986) or Gazeau (2009).
Lemma 4.2 T commutes with every V (h); h ∈K.
Proof
V (h)T =

V (h)|φ(k)⟩⟨φ(k)|dν(kφ0) =

|φ(hk)⟩⟨φ(k)|dν(kφ0)
=

|φ(r)⟩⟨φ(h−1r)|dν(h−1rφ0).
Since |φ(h−1r)⟩= V (h−1r)|φ0⟩= V (h−1)V (r)|φ0⟩= V (h)†|φ(r)⟩, we have
⟨φ(h−1r)| = ⟨φ(r)|V (h), and since the measure ν is left invariant, it follows that
V (h)T = T V (h).
⊓⊔
From the above and Schur’s Lemma it follows that T = λI for some λ. Since T
by construction can only have positive eigenvalues, we must have λ > 0. Deﬁning
the measure μ(dφ) = λ−1ν(dφ) we therefore have

|φ⟩⟨φ|μ(dφ) = I.
(4.13)
For a more elaborate similar construction taking into account the so-called isotropy
subgroup, see Chapter 2 of Perelomov (1986).

Focusing and a New Resolution of the Identity
Again let Ωφ be the space of inaccessible conceptual variables, and let us focus on
a permissible maximally accessible function θ(·) on Ωφ. Then, using (4.9) we can
deﬁne a group G acting upon the range Ωθ of θ(·). In principle θ(·) and thus G can
be quite arbitrary. However, we have the following important results:
Lemma 4.3 When G is deﬁned by (4.9), and K is transitive on Ωφ, then G is
transitive on Ωθ.
Proof Fix φ0 ∈Ωφ and let θ0 ∈Ωθ be deﬁned by θ0 = θ(φ0). By assumption,
every φ ∈Ωφ can be written in the form φ = kφ0 for some k ∈K. An arbitrary
θ ∈Ωθ is then of the form θ = θ(φ) = θ(kφ0) = gθ(φ0) = gθ0.
⊓⊔
Lemma 4.4 In the above setting, let V (·) be a unitary irreducible representation of
K on some Hilbert space K , and for k ∈K let g = g(k) be determined by (4.9).
Put U(g(k)) = V (k). Then U(·) is a unitary representation of G.
Proof By Lemma 4.1, (4.9) gives a homomorphism. Let gi = g(ki) for i = 1, 2.
This implies U(g1g2) = V (k1k2)) = U(g1)U(g2). U is unitary since V is unitary.
⊓⊔
The rest will depend on the nature of the group G. If G is Abelian, all irreducible
representations are one-dimensional. Assume temporarily that G is non-Abelian.
Then it has an irreducible representation on at least one space of dimension larger
than one. I will assume temporarily that the above U(·) has such a subrepresentation,
by a slight abuse of language also called U(·). Let thus H be a subspace of K on
which the representation U(·) is irreducible. Then the construction of the previous
subsection can be repeated.
Explicitly, ﬁx θ0 ∈Ωθ. Then every θ ∈Ωθ can be written as θ = gθ0 for
some g ∈G. Also, let U(g) be the unitary irreducible representation of G acting
on a Hilbert space H , and ﬁx a vector |θ0⟩∈H . Deﬁne the coherent states |θ⟩=
U(g)|θ0⟩when θ = gθ0. Then by the argument of the previous section, there exists
a measure ρ on Ωθ such that

|θ⟩⟨θ|ρ(dθ) = I.
(4.14)
For later use it may be crucial to treat θ explicitly as a function on Ωφ, and let ρ be
the marginalization of a measure μ on Ωφ. Then it follows that

|θ(φ)⟩⟨θ(φ)|μ(dφ) = I.
(4.15)

86
4
Towards Quantum Theory
Note that if |ψ(φ)⟩= V |θ(φ)⟩for some unitary operator V , then an equivalent
resolution of the identity is

|ψ(φ)⟩⟨ψ(φ)|μ(dφ) = I.
(4.16)
Quantum Operators
Again let Ωφ be the space of an inaccessible conceptual variable φ, and let θ(φ)
be an accessible e-variable that to begin with is assumed to be permissible with
respect to the group K, so that a group G on θ is induced. As above, let U(·) be an
irreducible representation of G on some Hilbert space H . Then (4.14) and (4.15)
hold. I will also assume θ to be maximally accessible and that θ is real-valued or a
vector.
In general, an operator corresponding to θ may be deﬁned by
A = Aθ =

θ(φ)|θ(φ)⟩⟨θ(φ)|μ(dφ)
(4.17)
=

θ|θ⟩⟨θ|ρ(dθ).
(4.18)
Remark The operator A can be deﬁned by (4.18) for virtually any representation
U(·) of G behind the coherent states |θ⟩. For this deﬁnition to be meaningful,
i.e., there is a connection to (4.14), we need the representation to be irreducible.
This problem is further discussed in the next subsection, where I will look at two
maximally accessible variables at the same time.
A is deﬁned on a domain D(A) of vectors |v⟩∈H
where the integral
deﬁning ⟨v|Av⟩converges. It is important here that the ﬁrst deﬁnition here requires
permissibility of the mapping θ(·), but that in the second deﬁnition one can dispense
with the requirement of permissibility if we in other ways have found G as a
transitive group acting on θ and U(·) as an irreducible representation of G. This
last observation will be important in the sections that follow later.
This mapping from an e-variable θ to an operator A has in the irreducible case
the following properties:
(i) If θ = 1, then A = I.
(ii) If θ is real-valued, then A is symmetric (for a deﬁnition of this concept for
operators and its relationship to self-adjointness, see Hall (2013).There is a
difference only if the domain D(A†) for A† given by ⟨uA†|v⟩= ⟨u|Av⟩is
larger than D(A), which I consider to be a very technical requirement.)
(iii) The change of basis through a unitary transformation is straightforward. This
is made concrete through the following result.

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
87
Theorem 4.2 For any transformation k of Ωφ and any unitary representation V
on which V (k) is deﬁned, V (k)†AV (k) is the operator corresponding to θ′(φ) =
θ(kφ).
Proof V (k−1)AV (k) =

θ(φ)|θ(k−1φ)⟩⟨θ(k−1φ)|dμ(k−1φ)
=

θ(kφ)|θ(φ)⟩⟨θ(φ)|dμ(φ).
⊓⊔
Note that if k ∈K and θ(·) is permissible, then θ(kφ) = gθ(φ) for some g ∈G,
so θ′ is just some transformation of θ. This case is needed in Theorem 4.4 below.
Note that for this theorem we need the following property of the states |θ⟩deﬁning
the Hilbert space H : These vectors are in one-to-one correspondence with the
values of θ, as given by transitivity of G by θ = gθ0 for g ∈G. This need not always
be the case with the construction above. (But see the more precise construction in
the next subsubsection.)
Consider the case where there are two permissible maximally accessible vari-
ables θa = θa(φ) and θb = θb(φ). Assume that there exists a transformation
kab such that θb(φ)
=
θa(kabφ). Then from Theorem 4.2 we have Ab
=
V (kab)†AaV (kab). If we can take H b = V (kab)H a = H a, both the operators
are deﬁned on the same Hilbert space.
More generally, for any operator A associated with a variable θ and acting upon
a Hilbert space H , B = V †AV will be an operator acting upon the equivalent
Hilbert space H ′ = V H when V is unitary. This corresponds to the case where the
resolution of the identity (4.15) is replaced by the resolution of the identity (4.16).
The vectors |ψ(φ)⟩may or may not correspond to a conceptual variable ψ.
Further properties of the mapping from θ to A are developed below. The mapping
corresponds to the usual way that the operators are allocated to observables in the
quantum mechanical literature. But note that this mapping comes naturally here
from the notions of conceptual variable and e-variables on which group actions are
deﬁned.
Several Accessible Variables
Let θa = θa(φ) for a ∈A , some index set, be a set of accessible variables. Pick
out two of these, θ and ξ, assumed to be maximally accessible, and suppose that
there exists a k ∈K such that ξ(φ) = θ(kφ). Let G be a transitive group acting
on θ, and let H be the transitive group acting on ξ deﬁned by hξ(φ) = g′θ(kφ)
when ξ(φ) = θ(kφ), where g′ ∈G′, an independent copy of G. This gives an
isomorphism between G and H.

Towards Quantum Theory
Let N be the group acting on ψ = (θ, ξ) generated by G and H and a single
element j deﬁned by jψ = (ξ, θ) and jθ = ξ. For g ∈G, deﬁne gjψ(φ) =
(gθ(kφ), θ(φ)) when ξ = θ(kφ), and for h ∈H deﬁne hjψ = (ξ(φ), hξ(k−1φ))
when θ(φ) = ξ(k−1φ). Since G and H are transitive on the components, and since
through j one can choose for a group element of N to act ﬁrst arbitrarily on the
ﬁrst component and then arbitrarily on the second component, N is transitive on ψ.
Also, N is non-Abelian: gj ̸= jg.
I want to ﬁx some Hilbert space H and deﬁne a representation U(·) of G on
this Hilbert space with the property that if we ﬁx some vector |v0⟩∈H , then the
vectors U(g)|v0⟩are in one-to-one correspondence with the group elements g ∈G
and hence with the values gθ0 of θ for some ﬁxed θ0. (I assume for simplicity that
the isotropy group of G is trivial.) To this end, let H be L2(Ωθ, dρ), where ρ is
the left invariant measure on Ωθ, and deﬁne the regular representation U(g)f (θ) =
f (g−1θ). Making the technical assumption that

∥f (gθ) −f (θ)∥2dρ(θ) ̸= 0 for
every non-trivial f ∈H and every g different from the unit element, it is easy to
prove the desired property of this representation: Note that ρ is left invariant, so it
follows from this assumption that U(g1)f (θ) ̸= U(g2)f (θ) whenever g1 ̸= g2.
For each element g ∈G there is an element h = jgj ∈H and vice versa. Note
that j · j = e, the unit element. Let U(j) = E be some unitary operator on H such
that E · E = I. Then for the representation U(·) of G, there is a representation V (·)
of H given by V (jgj) = EU(g)E. These are acting on the same Hilbert space H
with vectors |v⟩.
Note that E must satisfy EU(jgj) = U(g)E. By Schur’s Lemma this demands
E to be an isomorphism or the zero operator if the representation U(·) is irreducible.
In the reducible case a non-trivial operator E exists, however:
In this case there exists at least one proper invariant subrepresentation U0
acting on some vector space H0, a subspace of H , and another proper invariant
subrepresentation U′
0 acting on a vector space H ′
0 . Fix |v0⟩∈H0 and |v′
0⟩∈H ′
0 ,
and then deﬁne E|v0⟩= |v′
0⟩, E|v′
0⟩= |v0⟩, and E|v⟩= |v⟩for any |v⟩∈H which
is orthogonal to |v0⟩and |v′
0⟩.
Now we can deﬁne a representation W(·) of the full group N acting on ψ =
(θ, ξ) in the natural way: W(g) = U(g) for g ∈G, W(h) = V (h) for h ∈H,
W(j) = E, and then on products from this.
If U is irreducible, then also V is an irreducible representation of H, and we
can deﬁne operators Aθ corresponding to θ and Aξ corresponding to ξ as in (4.17)–
(4.18). If not, we need to show that the representation W of N constructed above is
irreducible on H .
Lemma 4.5 Assume in the above setting that either a perfect measurement of θ
may be done or a real measurement and that the relevant group acting upon the data
space is transitive and has a trivial isotropy group. Then W(·) as deﬁned above is
irreducible.
Proof Assume that W(·) is reducible, which implies that both U(·) and V (·) are
reducible, i.e., can be deﬁned on a lower-dimensional space H0, and that E = W(j)
can also be deﬁned on this lower-dimensional space. Let R(·) be the representation

of G restricted to vectors |u⟩in H orthogonal to H0. Fix some vector |u0⟩in this
orthogonal space; then consider the vectors in this space given by R(g)|u0⟩. Note
that the vectors orthogonal to H0 together with the vectors in H0 span H , and the
vectors U(g)|u0⟩in H are in one-to-one correspondence with θ. Then the vectors
R(g)|u0⟩are in one-to-one correspondence with a subvariable θ1. And deﬁne the
representation S(·) of H by S(jgj) = R(g) and vectors S(h)|v0⟩, where |v0⟩is a
ﬁxed vector of H , orthogonal to H0. These are in one-to-one correspondence with
a subparameter ξ1 of ξ.
Let ﬁrst a perfect measurement of θ be done, giving the result θ = u. Since
θ = gθ0 in general, there is an element gu ∈G such that u = guθ0. Because the
isotropy group of G is trivial, gu is uniquely determined by u.
Consider then a real measurement with data z and a statistical model P(z|θ). By
assumption this group is transitive and has a trivial isotropy group. Fix a data value
z0, and assume a group G∗acting on the data space. Let the measurement be given
by z = u. There is a unique element g∗= g∗
u ∈G∗such that u = g∗
uz0, and this
again determines a unique element gu acting upon θ through the homomorphism
given by the model (P(z|gθ) = P(g∗−1z|θ)). So again, gu is uniquely determined
by the data value u.
From this look at the ﬁxed vector S(jguj)|v0⟩. By what has been said above, this
corresponds to a unique value s of ξ1, which is determined by gu, and hence by the
measurement value u. But this means that the measurement value gives an estimate
of the vector (θ, ξ1), contrary to the assumption that θ is maximally accessible. Thus
W(·) cannot be reducible.
⊓⊔
Remark For more on groups acting on data and parameters in statistics, see Helland
(2004).
By the previous subsections this implies that for a left invariant measure ν on Ωψ
we can deﬁne |ψ0⟩∈H and coherent states |ψ⟩= W(n)|ψ0⟩∈H such that

|ψ⟩⟨ψ|ν(dψ) = I.
(4.19)
Since the group N on ψ
= (θ, ξ) is generated by G acting on θ and,
independently, H acting on ξ, and we have a symmetric situation, we must have
ν(dθdξ) = ρ(dθ)ρ(dξ) for some left invariant measure ρ.
The integral in (4.19) is over Ωθ ⊗Ωξ. Let us perform the integral over ξ, giving
P(θ) =

Ωξ
|ψ⟩⟨ψ|ρ(dξ).
(4.20)
This means that we have a resolution of the identity
I =

Ωθ
P(θ)ρ(dθ),
(4.21)

90

Towards Quantum Theory
and we can from this deﬁne an operator
Aθ =

Ωθ
θP(θ)ρ(dθ).
(4.22)
This operator will have the same properties as the operator deﬁned—in a
different situation—by (4.18). In particular Theorem 4.2 may be generalized, by
a modiﬁcation of the same proof. The details are given in Appendix C. Several
conclusions follow from this:
(a) Assume that θ = θ(φ) is a permissible function on Ωφ with respect to the group
K acting on this space. Then, given k ∈K, θ′(φ) = θ(kφ) = gθ(φ) for some
g ∈G, and the operator V (k)†AθV (k) corresponds just to some transformation
of θ. This operator has the same eigenvalues as Aθ, so the proof of Theorem 4.4
below also goes through in this situation. It follows then that Ωθ is identical to
the set of eigenvalues of Aθ in the case of discrete eigenvalues.
(b) Consider the case above where there are two maximally accessible variables
θ = θ(φ) and ξ = ξ(φ). Then the operator corresponding to θ is given
by (4.22) above, and the operator corresponding to ξ is given by (4.23) below.
Assume that there exists a transformation k such that ξ(φ) = θ(kφ). Then from
Theorem 4.2 we have Aξ = V (k†)AθV (k). If we can take V (k)H = H , both
the operators are deﬁned on the same Hilbert space.
(c) More generally, for any operator A associated with a variable θ and acting upon
a Hilbert space H , B = V †AV will be an operator acting upon the equivalent
Hilbert space H ′ = V H when V is unitary. This corresponds to the case
where the resolution of the identity (4.15) is replaced by the resolution of the
identity (4.16). The vectors |ψ(φ)⟩may or may not correspond to a conceptual
variable ψ.
In the same way as in (4.22) we can deﬁne
Aξ =

Ωξ
ξQ(ξ)dρ(ξ),
(4.23)
where
Q(ξ) =

Ωθ
|ψ⟩⟨ψ|dρ(θ).
(4.24)
Note that all this depends on the maximally accessible variable θ and a unitary
representation U(·) of the group G deﬁned on θ such that the coherent states
U(g)|θ0⟩were in one-to-one correspondence with the values of θ. This construction
was shown to be possible under weak conditions.

A Projective Representation
In the above discussion, I started with an irreducible representation U(·) of the group
G on the space H = L2(Ωθ, ρ) and then arrived at operators A = Aθ and B = Aξ.
Up to this point I have ignored phase factors. In Gazeau (2018) a more precise
analysis was carried out for the special case where Ωθ = R, G is taken as the
translation group, and dρ(θ) = dθ. A very explicit discussion for signal analysis
is given in Gazeau and Habonimana (2020). Some of this discussion can also be
transferred to our more general case.
An equivalent way to see the inclusion of phase factors is to start with the group
N deﬁned on Ωθ ⊗Ωξ, and consider the center S(N) of this group, deﬁned as
the element that commutes with all elements of N. This is a normal subgroup, and
the cosets N/S(N) deﬁne a new group. This new group should replace N in the
discussion above. Since θ and ξ are maximally accessible, it follows that S(N)
must be limited to transformations of phase factors.
In the special case considered by Gazeau (2018), this construction leads to
the Weyl–Heisenberg group, which is much studied in the literature, see for
instance (Perelomov, 1986). By von Neumann’s uniqueness theorem, any inﬁnite-
dimensional unitary irreducible representation of this group is characterized by a
real number λ ̸= 0, and the projective representation can be obtained by ﬁxing λ
and completing with a phase factor.
Conclusions, Several Accessible Variables
The construction simpliﬁes when θ takes only two values ±1: See the discussion of
the qubit case in Sect. 4.4.7 below. In that case (4.21) simpliﬁes to give
I =

Ωθ
|θ⟩⟨θ|ρ(dθ),
(4.25)
even though the representation U(·) is not irreducible. And (4.22) simpliﬁes to
Aθ =

Ωθ
θ|θ⟩⟨θ|ρ(dθ).
(4.26)
Let us summarize the result of this subsection.
Theorem 4.3 Consider a situation where there are two maximally accessible
conceptual variables θ and ξ. Make the following assumptions:
(i) On one of these variables, θ, there can be deﬁned group actions from a
transitive, proper, and locally compact group G with a trivial isotropy group.
(ii) There exists a unitary irreducible representation U(·) of the group G deﬁned
on θ such that the coherent states U(g)|θ0⟩are in one-to-one correspondence
with the values of θ.

92

Towards Quantum Theory
(iii) There exists a perfect measurement of θ or an ordinary measurement involving
a transitive group on the data space with a trivial isotropy group.
(iv) The two maximally accessible variables θ and ξ can both be seen as functions
of an underlying inaccessible conceptual variable φ. There is a group K acting
on φ such that ξ(φ) = θ(kφ) for some k ∈K.
Then there exists a Hilbert space H connected to the situation, and to every
accessible conceptual variable there can be associated a unique symmetric operator
on H . For the maximally accessible variable ξ this operator is of the form (4.23).
Theorem 4.2 and the corresponding results of the discussion in Sect. 4.3.3 are valid
for this operator.
Remark The assumption (iv) may seem special. This assumption was, between
arbitrary θa and θb, shown above to be equivalent with the property that the
corresponding operators can be connected by a suitable unitary transformation. It
will also be important in what follows. As an example, it holds in the spin/angular
momentum case, where θa is the spin component in direction a, and where K
consists of all rotations of the inaccessible spin vector φ: Let kab be a 180◦rotation
around the midline between the vectors a and b.
Proof By Assumption (i) and by Theorem 4.1 there exists, relative to the group,
a left invariant measure on the variable called θ here. This induces a left invariant
measure on the vector (θ, ξ) by the construction made here. The rest follows from
the discussion above.
⊓⊔
I see this as a very important result and a good point of departure for further
development of quantum theory. Note again that everything that is said elsewhere
about the operator A = Aθ seems to be valid in this setting.
Note that the situation here can be associated by a single observer/actor, or by
a group of communicating actors. The maximally accessible variables may also be
called complementary, following Nils Bohr. A symmetric operator will often be self-
adjoint; see Hall (2013), in particular, there is no distinction when the Hilbert space
is ﬁnite-dimensional.
The result is important because of the relatively weak assumption made. For one
actor, the essential assumption is that he in the given situation and at the given time
shall have two maximally accessible conceptual variables in his mind. To say it in a
very popular way, he should have two maximal ideas in his head at the same time.
If this and some technical assumptions are true, the whole Hilbert space apparatus
can be constructed. And then associated with each conceptual variable there can, in
an explicit way, be constructed an operator on the Hilbert space.
Proof The conditions of Theorem 4.3 can be weakened. In Helland
(2021) a
version of the theorem is proved with the following improvements:
(1) Condition (iii) is dropped. This makes the theorem relevant in connection to
decision theory and cognitive modelling.
(2) An arbitrary phase is included into the quantum state.
Also, a corresponding version of Theorem 4.2 is proved.

The Spectral Theorem and Operators for Functions of θ
Take now θ = θa to be real-valued or a real vector, a maximally accessible variable.
Let A = Aa be the operator corresponding to θ. Then based on the spectral theorem
(Hall, 2013) we have that there exists a projection-valued measure, E on Ωθ such
that for |v⟩∈D(A)
⟨v|A|v⟩=

σ(A)
θd⟨v|E(θ)|v⟩.
(4.27)
Here σ(A) is the spectrum of A as deﬁned in Hall (2013). The case with a discrete
spectrum is discussed in the next subsection.
A more informal way to write (4.27) is
A =

σ(A)
θdE(θ).
(4.28)
This deﬁnes an orthogonal resolution of the identity

σ(A)
dE(θ) = I.
(4.29)
From this, we can deﬁne the operator of an arbitrary Borel-measurable function
of θ by
Af (θ) =

σ(A)
f (θ)dE(θ).
(4.30)
Important special cases include f (θ) = I(θ ∈B) for sets B. Another important
observation is the following: Any accessible variable can be written as f (θ),
where θ is maximally accessible. Thus (4.30) can be used to deﬁne an operator
corresponding to an arbitrary e-variable, taking a maximally accessible variable as
a point of departure.
Note that this operator can be deﬁned always, but in order to deﬁne group actions
on η = f (θ), we need that this function is permissible with respect to the group G
acting on θ.
A further important case is connected to statistical inference theory in the way it
is advocated later in this book. Assume that there are data z and a statistical model
for these data of the form P(Z ∈C|θ) for sets C. Then a positive operator-valued
measure (POVM) on the data space can be deﬁned by
M(C) =

σ(A)
P(Z ∈C|θ)dE(θ).
(4.31)

94
4
Towards Quantum Theory
The density of M at a point z is called the likelihood effect in Chap. 5 and is the
basis for the focused likelihood principle formulated there.
Finally, given a probability measure with density π(θ) over the values of θ, one
can deﬁne a density operator σ by
σ =

σ(A)
π(θ)dE(θ).
(4.32)
Here the probability measure π was assumed to have one out of three possible
interpretations: (1) as a Bayesian prior, (2) as a Bayesian posterior, or (3) as derived
from a frequentist conﬁdence distribution (see Sect. 2.1.4).
Some Further Theorems
Note that the construction above of an operator corresponding to a conceptual
variable can be made for any maximally accessible conceptual variable θ. If θ is
not maximally accessible, an operator for θ can be deﬁned by analogy with (4.30). I
will now assume that A has a purely discrete spectrum. Let the eigenvalues be {uj}
and let the corresponding eigenspaces be {Vj}. The vectors of these eigenspaces
are deﬁned as quantum states, and as discussed in detail in the next section, each
eigenspace Vj can be associated with a question “What is the value of θ?” together
with a deﬁnite answer “θ = uj.” This assumes that the set of values of θ can be
reduced to this set of eigenvalues, which I will justify as follows.
Theorem 4.4 Assume that the e-variable θ = θ(φ) is permissible with respect to
some transitive group K, which allows the group G on Ωθ to be deﬁned. Let {uj}
be the eigenvalues of the operator A corresponding to θ. Then it follows that Ωθ is
identical to this set of eigenvalues.
Remark It can be shown by an independent argument that this result is also valid
for the spin/angular momentum case, even though the spin components are only
permissible under a transitive group for the spin 1/2 case.
Proof For each j, let |j⟩be an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue uj, and let g ∈G.
Then gθ(φ) = θ(kφ) for some k ∈K. By Theorem 4.2 we have that the operator
V (k−1)AV (k) is mapped by gθ(φ). Assume now that θ0 = uj for some j. We
need to show that gθ0 is another eigenvalue for A, which follows from the fact that
|V (k−1)AV (k) −λI| = |A −λI|, so that these two determinants have the same
zeros.
Let I0 = {uj : uj = gθ0 for some g ∈G}. Since G is transitive on Ωθ by
Lemma 4.3, it follows that I0 = Ωθ.
Above, I have assumed that one value of θ, θ = θ0, was an eigenvalue of A.
So the conclusion so far is that if one value is an eigenvalue, then all values in Ωθ
are eigenvalues. Now the same arguments could have been done with respect to
the operator B = γ A for some ﬁxed constant γ ̸= 0. For each γ the conclusion

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
95
is: Either (i) all values in Ωθ are eigenvalues of B, or (ii) no values in Ωθ are
eigenvalues of B.
Now go back to the ﬁrst deﬁnition (4.18) of A = Aθ and to the second
deﬁnition (4.22). Changing from A to B here amounts to changing θ to θ′ = γ θ. It
is clear that we can always choose γ in such a way that there is one value in Ωθ′ that
equals the ﬁrst eigenvalue of B. Thus the conclusion (i) holds for one choice of γ .
Now the change from θ to θ′ also changes the measure ρ. It is only one choice of γ ,
namely γ = 1, which makes the resolution of the identity (4.14), respectively (4.21)
valid, which is crucial for the theory. Thus one is forced to conclude that γ = 1 and
that the conclusion (i) holds for this choice.
Hence, Ωθ is contained in the set of eigenvalues of A. If there were one
eigenvalue that is not contained in Ωθ, one can use this eigenvalue as a basis for
choosing γ in the argument above, hence get a contradiction. Thus the two sets are
identical.
⊓⊔
We also have the following:
Theorem 4.5 The e-variable θ is maximally accessible if and only if each
eigenspace Vj of the operator A is one-dimensional.
Proof The assertion that there exists an eigenspace that is not one-dimensional
is equivalent with the following: Some eigenvalue uj corresponds to at least two
orthogonal eigenvectors |j⟩and |i⟩. Based on the spectral theorem, the operator A
corresponding to θ can be written as 
r urPr, where Pr is the projection upon the
eigenspace Vr. Now deﬁne a new e-variable ψ whose operator B has the following
properties: If r ̸= j, the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of B are equal to those of
A. If r = j, B has two different eigenvalues on the two one-dimensional spaces
spanned by |j⟩and |i⟩, respectively; otherwise its eventual eigenvalues are equal to
uj in the space Vj. Then, θ = θ(ψ), and ψ ̸= θ is inaccessible if and only if θ is
maximally accessible. This construction is impossible if and only if all eigenspaces
are one-dimensional.
⊓⊔
4.4.5
The Non-Permissible Case
Take a brief look at the case where θ(·) is not necessarily permissible with respect to
the basic group K. Then there always exists a subgroup of K with respect to which
θ(·) is permissible.
Theorem 4.6 Let H be the subset of K consisting of any transformation h such that
θ(φ1) = θ(φ2) implies and is implied by θ(hφ1) = θ(hφ2) for all pairs φ1, φ2 ∈Φ.
Then H is a group, and the maximal group under which θ(·) is permissible.
Proof We must show that H is a group. Let h1 and h2 belong to H, and let
φ1, φ2 be a pair such that θ(φ1) = θ(φ2). Then θ(h2φ1) = θ(h2φ2) and thus

96
4
Towards Quantum Theory
θ(h1h2φ1) = θ(h1h2φ2), and the implication the other way is similar. Therefore, H
contains products, and in an obvious way it contains inverses, so H is a group. By
its deﬁnition θ(·) is permissible under this group, and it is the maximal group with
this property.
⊓⊔
In principle, the whole theory can then be repeated by replacing K with H. As
before, H induces a group G in Ωθ by gθ(φ) = θ(hφ) for h ∈H. The problem,
however, is that H is not necessarily transitive on Ωφ, and then G is not transitive
on Ωθ.
Recall the following principle from Sect. 2.2:
If there is a group G acting on Ωθ, any model reduction should be to an orbit or
to a set of orbits of G.
In this connection, let this be seen as a principle for quantization. In the special
case where we reduce to a single orbit of G, we can also assume that there exists an
irreducible unitary representation U(·) of G on some Hilbert space H and that the
reduced θ is maximally accessible. Then an operator A corresponding to θ can be
constructed as in Sect. 4.4.4, and it will have properties as described above.
4.4.6
Coupling Different E-variables Together
The Maximal Case
In this section consider a Hilbert space H of ﬁnite dimension d. Again let φ be
an inaccessible conceptual variable. For an index set A , focus on λa for a ∈A , a
set of maximally accessible e-variables. Note that each λa corresponds to a unique
operator Aa and that this operator has the spectral decomposition
Aa =

j
ua
j|a; j⟩⟨a; j|.
(4.33)
By maximality, only one λa can be measured on the system at a given time. This
is a manifestation of Niels Bohr’s complementarity.
The following will be argued in Sect. 4.5 in some generality, and speciﬁcally in
the case of spin/angular momentum: given a vector |v⟩∈H , there is at most one
pair (a, j) such that |a; j⟩= |v⟩. The main interpretation in Sect. 4.5 is motivated
as follows: Suppose the existence of such a vector |v⟩with |v⟩= |a; j⟩for some a
and j. Then the fact that the state of the system is |v⟩means that one has focused on
a question (“What is the value of λa?”) and obtained the deﬁnite answer (λa = ua
j)
The question can be associated with the orthonormal basis {|a; j⟩; j = 1, 2, . . . , d}.
After this we are left with the problem of determining conditions under which
all vectors |v⟩∈H can be interpreted as above. This will put some constraint on
index set A . The problem will not be considered further here. However, it should
be noted, this constraint holds in the simple case of a spin 1/2 particle, as discussed
in Sect. 4.5.

4.4
A New Foundation for the Quantum Formalism
97
The following simple observation should also be noted: Trivially, every vector |v⟩
is the eigenvector of some operators. Assume that there is one such operator A that
is physically meaningful, and for which |v⟩is also a non-degenerate eigenvector.
Let λ be a physical variable associated with A. Then |v⟩can again be interpreted as
a question (“What is the value of λ?”) along with a deﬁnite answer to this question.
The General Case
First go back to the maximal symmetrical epistemic setting. Let again λa = λa(φ)
be as in n. Let ta be an arbitrary function on the range of λa, and let us focus on
θa = ta(λa) for each a ∈A .
Let the Hilbert space be as in the previous subsection, and suppose that it has an
orthonormal basis that can be written in the form |a; i⟩for i = 1, . . . , n. Let {ua
i }
be the values of λa, and let {sa
j } be the values of θa. Deﬁne Ca
j = {i : ta(ua
i ) = sa
j },
and let V a
j be the space spanned by {|a; i⟩: i ∈Ca
j }. Let Πa
j be the projection upon
V a
j .
Then we have the following interpretation of any |a; i⟩∈V a
j . (1) the question:
“What is the value of θa?” has been posed, and (2) we have obtained the answer
θa = sa
j . Note that in this case, several pairs (a, i) correspond to a given vector |v⟩.
To be more precise, we should say that the whole eigenspace V a
j is connected to a
question-and-answer pair.
From the above construction we may also deﬁne the operator connected to the
e-variable θa as
Aa =

j
sa
j Πa
j =

i
ta(ua
i )|a; i⟩⟨a; i|.
(4.34)
Note that this gives all possible states and all possible values corresponding to the
accessible e-variable θa. Unless the function ta is one-to-one, the operator Aa has
no longer distinct eigenvalues.
4.4.7
Three Examples
Spin/Angular Momentum
The group theory applied in this and in the following example is well known and
discussed in depth in many books. Here, the point is to consider the group as a
group action on a space of conceptual variables. To this end, consider a spin or
angular momentum vector φ with ﬁxed norm r varying on a sphere Ωφ with radius
r. This vector is inaccessible. Let K be the group of rotations of φ. The components
θa = ∥φ∥cos(a, φ) can be deﬁned. When discretized in the usual way, these can be
measured and are e-variables.

98
4
Towards Quantum Theory
The following example, due to Yoh Tanimoto, shows that θa under the mapping
φ →θa(φ) and the group K is not permissible. Look at the case a = z and use
Cartesian coordinates.
Take φ1 = (1, 0, 0), φ2 = (0.1, 0), while k is the rotation in the xz-plane such
that kφ1 = (0, 0, 1), kφ2 = (0, 1, 0). Here θz(φ1) = θz(φ2), while θz(kφ1) ̸=
θz(kφ2).
According to Theorem 4.6, for ﬁxed a there is a subgroup H a of K with respect
to which θa is permissible. In the present case this can be taken as: Rotations of
φ around a (which ﬁx θa), together with a reﬂection: a →−a. The orbits of this
group are given by sets θa ∈{−c, c} for some c ≥0.
Now, to motivate the usual discretization, use the general principle for model
reduction in Sect. 4.4.5, and choose units such that either c = k with k =
0, 1, . . ., j for some integer j, or c =
2k+1
2
with k = 0, 1, . . ., 2j for some
half-integer j, giving j + 1, respectively, 2j + 1 orbits. Then after such a model
reduction/quantization, each θa takes the values −j, −j + 1, . . . , j −1, j for some
integer or half-integer j. Note that for instance the assumptions of Theorem 4.4 do
not hold in the form given there in this case. The reduced group Ga from H a consists
just of the identity and a reﬂection and is only transitive for the case j = 1/2. And
H a is far from the full group K. However, choosing Ga to be a translation-like
group, the conclusion of Theorem 4.4 will hold.
Spin coherent states and their connection to the group SU(2) are discussed
thoroughly in Perelomov (1986); Gazeau (2009). I will follow parts of Perelomov
(1986) without going into detail. It is crucial that any irreducible representation D
is given by a non-negative integer or half-integer j: D(k) = Dj(k), dim(Dj) =
d = 2j + 1. In the representation space H = Hj the canonical basis |j; m⟩exists,
where m runs from −j to j in unit steps.
Seen as matrices, the operators D(k) may be taken to act on the d-dimensional
vector space Cd. These matrix representations are discussed in many books, for
instance (Ma, 2007). It is stated on op. cit., page 129 that D is a single-valued
representation of the group SO(3) when j is an integer and a double-valued
representation when j is half of an odd integer. In all cases it is a representation
of SU(2).
The inﬁnitesimal operators A± = Ax±iAy, A0 = Az of the group representation
Dj—which in the spin case can replace the quantum operators as deﬁned in
Sect. 4.4.4—satisfy the commutation relations
[A0, A±] = ±A±, [A−, A+] = −2A0.
(4.35)
The operators Ax, Ay, and Az are related to inﬁnitesimal rotations around the x-axis,
y-axis, and z-axis, respectively, and we take A = (Ax, Ay, Az). The representation
space vectors |j; m⟩are eigenvectorsfor the operators A0 and A2 = (Ax)2+(Ay)2+
(Az)2:
A0|j; m⟩= m|j; m⟩, A2|j; m⟩= j(j + 1)|j; m⟩.

which all have eigenvalues ±1 and satisfy A2 = I.
One can illustrate the theory of Sect. 4.4.4 on this example. Let Gx be a group
acting on θx. The elements of this group must be of the form e and g with g · g = e.
Any representation Ux must then be given by Ux(e) = I and Ux(g) = D, where
D is a 2x2 unitary matrix such that D · D = I. It is easily seen that this implies that
D is of the form
D =
 a
b
b∗−a

,
(4.38)
where a is real-valued.
The switching matrix E = U(h) must have the same properties and thus be
another matrix of the same form (4.38). Finally, the matrix EDE, determining the
representation Uz, say must also be of this form.
Note that all of the Pauli spin matrices are of the required form, so these can be
used as D, E, and EDE in any order.
The representation combining Ux and Uz, corresponding to ψ = (θx, θz), will
be irreducible, conforming the result of Lemma 4.5. The essential requirement in the
case of perfect measurements in this Lemma is that the groups Gx and Gz should
be transitive, which then of course are in this case.
To show that (4.25) and (4.26) hold in this case, let v = (x, y)′, D = Az, and
u = Dv = (x, −y)′. Then (4.25) is equivalent to
vv† + uu† = I,
(4.39)
which implies |x|2 = |y|2 = 1/2, and (4.26) is equivalent to Aa = vv† −uu†,
which gives
Aa =

.
(4.40)
This gives both Ax and Ay as possibilities. In any case Aa · Aa = I, so the
eigenvalues must be ±1.
In general the operator exp[iω(n · A)], ∥n∥= 1, describes the rotation by the
angle ω around the axis directed along n. In Perelomov (1986) this was used to
describe the coherent states D(k)|φ0⟩in various ways. The ket vector |φ0⟩may be
taken as |j; m⟩for a ﬁxed m; the simplest choice is m = −j. By using this rotation,

100

Towards Quantum Theory
it is seen that the same irreducible representation and the same representation space
H can be used to describe spin components in any direction.
In Sect. 4.5 below the following is proved: Let Aa = a1Ax +a2Ay +a3Az be the
operator corresponding to the spin component θa in the direction a = (a1, a2, a3).
Then for each a and each k = −j, −j + 1, . . . , j −1, j, there is exactly one ket
vector |v⟩= |a; k⟩with arbitrary phase such that Aa|v⟩= k|v⟩. This ket vector
corresponds to the question “What is the spin component θa in the direction a?”
together with the deﬁnite answer “θa = k.” In the special case j = 1/2 these
vectors constitute all normalized vectors in the Hilbert space.
Position and Momentum
Consider a particle moving in one dimension, where a point in the phase space is
given by φ = (ξ, π), and ξ ∈Ξ and π ∈Π are the position and momentum
of the particle, respectively. The vector φ is inaccessible, while both ξ and π are
accessible e-variables. I am considering separate measurements of ξ and π using a
simple application of the Heisenberg inequality.
We can let the group Gξ consist of translations of ξ:
ξ →ξ + c.
(4.41)
The invariant measure for this group is dν = dξ, the Hilbert space H can be taken
to be L2(Ξ, dξ), and the representation U(gξ) as the regular representation on this
space: f (ξ) →f (ξ −c) if gξ is given by ξ →ξ + c. Then the rest of the Hilbert
space construction can be made as in Sect. 4.4.4.
The groups Gξ and Gπ consist of separate transitions. As discussed in Chap. 5
and elsewhere, a Hilbert space can be chosen by a position representation or by a
momentum representation. The transition between these two representations is done
by a unitary operation deﬁned by a Fourier transform. In the ﬁrst case, we have
H = L2(Ξ, dξ), the operator Aξ consists of multiplication with ξ, and (¯h = 1)
Aπ is a differentiation operator i−1d/dξ, both operators with suitable domains of
deﬁnitions. These operators are unbounded and have continuous spectra.
Spekkens’ Toy Model
Look at the description of the simplest case of this toy model in Sect. 4.2. Then φ can
be considered to take values in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, and K is the permutation group
on this set. Irreducible representations V (·) of K can be found, but the speciﬁcation
of these is unnecessary. We concentrate on λa, say, which is 1 on the set {1, 2} and
0 on the set {3, 4}. Since λa takes two values, the group G acting on these values
must be as described in the spin 1/2 example discussed above, and the irreducible
representation U(·) as considered there. Since the λ’s take values 0 and 1, and the
spin components θ take values ±1, we can write λ = 1
2(1 + θ), and the operators B
for λ must satisfy B = 1
2(I +A), where the A’s are operators for θ. With 3 operators

Ax, Ay, and Az given by (4.37), this gives 3 operators Ba, Bb, and Bc for λa, λb,
and λc.
4.4.8
Concluding Remarks for Sect. 4.4
Group theory and quantum mechanics are intimately connected, as discussed in
detail in Greiner (1994) for example. The main purpose of this section has been to
show that the familiar Hilbert space formulation can be derived mathematically from
a simple basis of groups acting on conceptual variables. The consequences of this
are further discussed in Chap. 5. This discussion also provides a link to statistical
inference, a link that will be further discussed in Chap. 6.
However, we already here must view the existence of such a connection between
quantum theory and statistical inference theory as an essential assumption. From the
viewpoint of purely statistical inference the e-variables discussed in this chapter are
parameters. In many such situations also, it is useful to have a group of actions
G deﬁned on the parameter space; see for instance the discussion in Helland
(2004). For the spin/angular momentum case, the quantization implied by quantum
mechanics can be connected to the following principle: all model reductions in some
given model should be to an orbit or to a set of orbits of the group G.
It is of some interest that the same criterion can be used to derive the statistical
model corresponding to the partial least squares algorithm in chemometrics, see
Helland et al. (2012).
This section focuses on group symmetry in spaces of conceptual variables,
particularly those referred to as parameters/e-variables in Chap. 1. When data are
present, in statistical inference one often starts with a group G∗on the data space
(see for instance (Helland, 2004)). Referring to the statistical model P θ(z ∈B) for
measurable sets B in the data space, the relationship is given by P gθ(z ∈B) =
P θ(z ∈g∗B). This induces a group homomorphism from G∗to G. In some cases,
this is an isomorphism, and the same symbol g is often used in the data space and
the parameter space. However, this is not the case when the data space is discrete
and the parameter space is continuous, as when the model is given by a binomial
distribution or a Poisson distribution. This case is studied in detail in Heller and
Wang (2006). In these cases, group theoretical methods were ﬁrst used to construct
the Poisson family and the binomial family, and the basic tool is coherent states
for certain groups (the Weyl–Heisenberg group in the Poisson case and the group
SU(2) in the binomial case). Finally, inference is studied by reversing the roles of
data and parameter. The result in both cases is equivalent to Bayesian inference with
a uniform prior on the parameter, which may be a coincidence. Taking this and the
present section as a point of departure, there seems to be a possibility to provide
new ideas to symmetry-based approaches to statistical inference, and perhaps a
possibility to relate this to quantum measurement theory; however, this problem
area partly remains to be addressed in the future.

Towards Quantum Theory
As an extension of Heller and Wang (2006), a large class of probability
distributions are shown to have connections to coherent states in Ali et al. (2008).
For a general reference regarding coherent states, see Gazeau (2009).
In the present section, the ﬁrst axiom of quantum theory is derived from
reasonable assumptions. Parts of the section have been reproduced from Helland
(2019a). Symmetry in a space of conceptual variables, J. Math. Phys. 60. 052101,
with the permission of AIP Publishing. Much of this has been extended and
modiﬁed, however.
The second axiom, the Born formula, will be derived in Chap. 5 from a speciﬁc
set of assumptions.
One can perhaps expect after this that such a conceptual basis for quantum
theory may facilitate a further discussion regarding its relationship to relativity
theory. One possibility might be to regard physical variables as conceptual variables,
inaccessible inside black holes. In any case, such considerations go far beyond the
scopes of this book, whose purpose is limited to the aim of ﬁnding a good scientiﬁc
understanding of epistemic processes.

Quantum States and Their Interpretation
4.5.1
Introduction
It is now a universal agreement among physicists that quantum mechanics is the
most successful physical theory that has ever been developed. The calculations
devised from the theory may be complicated, but there is again a universal
agreement on how the calculations should be carried out.
Yet there is no agreement at all when it comes to interpretation of the theory.
Many conferences on quantum foundation have been arranged in recent years, but
as a result of this, the number of new interpretations has increased, and no one of
the old has died out. In two of these conferences, a poll among the participants was
carried out (Schlosshauer et al., 2013; Norsen and Nelson, 2013). The result was
an astonishing disagreement on several simple and fundamental questions. One of
these questions was whether quantum theory should be interpreted as an objective
theory of the world (the ontic interpretation) or if it only expresses our knowledge
of the world (the epistemic interpretation). In this book I try to give arguments for a
general epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics.
In this respect, conceptual variables, variables deﬁned by an observer or by
a group of communicating observers, are important. These variables are imaged
to emerge in connection to an epistemic process. Some such variables cannot be
measured, are inaccessible, say the vector (position, momentum) of a particle by
Heisenberg’s inequality. Another example is the vector (θx, θy), where θx is the
spin component of a particle in direction x and θy is the spin component in direction
y. A third example is the full spin vector.

4.5
Quantum States and Their Interpretation
103
Those variables that can be measured are called epistemic conceptual variable or
e-variables. In this section it will be assumed that each relevant e-variable can—in
agreement with Theorem 4.3—be associated with a unique operator on a suitable
Hilbert space.
As will be discussed below, states of the physical system can be argued to have
interpretations related to a question “What is the value of θ?” for an e-variable
θ, together with some information about θ, in the simplest, discrete, case full
information θ = u. Our main problem is to ﬁnd out how general this interpretation
is.
Throughout this section θ will be a discrete e-variable, taking a ﬁnite number
of values. The Hilbert space H will then be ﬁnite-dimensional, and as a special
case of (4.27) and (4.30), the operator A corresponding to θ will have a spectral
decomposition
A =

k
ukΠk,
(4.42)
where the projectors Πk satisfy

k
Πk = I.
(4.43)
In the special case where θ is maximally accessible, the eigenspaces will be one-
dimensional, and this reduces to
A =

k
uk|k⟩⟨k|,
(4.44)
where we have an orthogonal resolution of the identity

k
|k⟩⟨k| = I.
(4.45)
If there are several e-variables θa, the eigenvectors are written as |a; k⟩.
4.5.2
Quantum States and Question-and-Answer Pairs
State Vectors Corresponding to Maximally Accessible E-Variables
Assume a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space H , and let |v⟩be some unit vector in
H . Then trivially, |v⟩is an eigenvector of many operators. Assume that one can
ﬁnd such an operator A satisfying (1) A is physically meaningful, that is, can be
associated with an e-variable θ; (2) A has only one-dimensional eigenspaces.

104

Towards Quantum Theory
Then in particular, |v⟩corresponds to a single eigenvalue u of A and can be
associated with a question: “What is the value of θ?” together with an answer:
“θ = u.”
It is easy to see, and is shown explicitly in Theorem 4.5, that all eigenspaces of A
are one-dimensional if and only if θ is maximally accessible: Whenever in a given
context θ = f (ζ) for a function f that is not one-to-one, the conceptual variable ζ
is inaccessible.
Question-and-Answers Correspond to States
Consider a set of maximally accessible conceptual variables {θa = θa(φ); a ∈A }
for some index set A . Then, under weak assumptions, by the result of Sect. 4.4.4
each θa is associated with an operator Aa, and these can be deﬁned on the same
basic Hilbert space H . Concentrate on the discrete case, where the possible values
of θa are ua
i for i = 1, . . . , d. Then by Theorem 4.5 the eigenspaces of each Aa are
one-dimensional. Hence one can write
Aa =
d

i=1
ua
i |a; i⟩⟨a; i|.
(4.46)
Thus to each θa and ua
i there correspond a unique normalized ket vector |a; i⟩∈H ,
unique except for an arbitrary phase factor. Note that the question “What is the value
of θa?” together with sharp answer “θa = ua
i ” is in one-to-one correspondence with
the indicators I(θa = ua
i ).
Proposition 4.1 Let there be a Hilbert space H on which all the operators Aa,
where Aa corresponds to the maximally accessible θa, are deﬁned. Then to each
question-and-answer pair given by the indicator I(θa = ua
i ) there corresponds a
unique normalized ket vector |a; i⟩∈H . As i varies, the ket vectors |a; i⟩form an
orthonormal basis for H .
Again I see this as an important result, characterizing maximally accessible
conceptual variables. It follows from this result that the logical development in this
section implies that each question-and-answer pair connected to such variables can
be uniquely connected to a ket vector.
It remains to ﬁnd conditions under which the mapping I(θa = ua
i ) →|a; i⟩is
invertible in a given context. This is considered as an open problem here; Using
some additional arguments, this problem is posed as an open question to the
quantum community in Helland (2019b).

4.5
Quantum States and Their Interpretation
105
Note that in general the questions deﬁned above, corresponding to each θa, by
Proposition 4.1 imply the orthonormal set of ket vectors {|a; i⟩; i = 1, . . . , d} or
equivalently the orthogonal resolution of the identity
d

i=1
|a; i⟩⟨a; i| = I.
(4.47)
Under a weak condition, the result of Proposition 4.1 can be simpliﬁed. Assume
that for a ̸= b there is a one-to-one correspondence between θa and θb given by
θb(φ) = θa(kabφ) (no summation convention) for some group element kab of the
basic group K. Then we have:
Lemma 4.6 The values ua
i of θa can always be arranged such that ua
i = ui is the
same for each a (i = 1, 2, . . . , d).
Proof By deﬁnition
{φ : θb(φ) = ub
i } = {φ : θa(kabφ) = ub
i } = kba({φ : θa(φ) = ub
i }).
The sets in brackets on the lefthand side here are disjoint with union Ωφ. But then
the sets in brackets on the righthand side are disjoint with union kab(Ωφ) = Ωφ,
and this implies that {ub
i } gives all possible values of θa.
⊓⊔
4.5.3
Spin and Angular Momentum
The interpretation given in Sect. 4.5.2 is quite general. Since no permissibility
condition is needed here, the result of Sect. 4.5.2 is valid also for the spin/angular
momentum case. But for this case it can also be useful to see that a concrete general
construction can be given. To see this, consider a spin or angular momentum vector
φ with ﬁxed norm varying on a sphere Ωφ. This vector is inaccessible. However, by
the model reduction considered in Sects. 4.4.5 and 4.4.7, and given some direction
a, the components θa = ∥φ∥cos(a, φ) can be measured and are e-variables. Given
a certain normalization of φ, each θa takes the values −j, −j + 1, . . . , j −1, j for
some integer or half-integer j.
Proposition 4.2 Assume the usual Hilbert space for spin/angular momentum. For
each a and each h (h=-j,...,j) there is exactly one normalized ket vector |v⟩=
|a; h⟩with arbitrary phase such that the operator Aa corresponding to θa satisﬁes
Aa|v⟩= h|v⟩. This ket vector corresponds to the question “What is the value of the
angular momentum component θa?” together with the deﬁnite answer “θa = h.”
For the qubit case, dimension 2 of the Hilbert space, these vectors constitute all
ket vectors. This can be seen by a simple Bloch sphere argument. The proof of this
and the proof of Proposition 4.2 are given in the next subsection.

106

Towards Quantum Theory
The qubit case has recently been extensively generalized by Höhn (2017a,b)
and Höhn and Wever (2017). In those papers the quantum formalism for systems
of qubits is reconstructed from elementary rules on an observer’s information
acquisition: Essentially sets of questions and sharp answers to those questions. Note
that sets of binary questions can be considered as a single question; just let the e-
variable θ be a vector.
Proofs and Details in the Spin/Angular Momentum Case
Since all separable Hilbert spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic, we are
free to and will in this section use the ordinary Hilbert space formulation used in
textbooks for angular momenta/spins. The discussion here will rely on Messiah
(1969). Let the spin/angular momentum operator be A, let j in ∥A∥2 = j(j + 1) be
ﬁxed, let Ax, Ay, and Az be the angular momentum operators in directions x, y, and
z, respectively, and let Aa = a1Ax + a2Ay + a3Az be the operator corresponding to
angular momentum θa in the direction a = (a1, a2, a3). Without loss of generality,
assume 
i a2
i = 1.
Proof of Proposition 4.2 Let {|m⟩}; m = −j, . . ., j be the normalized eigenstates
of Az, and seek a ket vector |v⟩= j
m=−j bm|m⟩with  |bm|2 = 1 satisfying
Aa|v⟩= h|v⟩. From Messiah (1969) the operators A+ = Ax + iAy and A−=
Ax −iAy satisfy
A+|m⟩=
	
(j −m)(j + m −1)|m + 1⟩= Am|m + 1⟩; m ̸= j,
A−|m⟩=
	
(j + m)(j −m + 1)|m −1⟩= Bm|m −1⟩; m ̸= −j.
Solving this for Ax and Ay leads to
Aa|v⟩= (a1Ax + a2Ay + a3Az)

2(a1 + ia2)bm+1Bm+1 + a3bmm]|m⟩
if we deﬁne A−j−1 = Bj+1 = 0. Putting this equal to h  bm|m⟩we get the
recursion relations
1
2(a1 + ia2)bm+1Bm+1 = hbm −a3mbm −1
2(a1 −ia2)bm−1Am−1
for h, m = −j, . . ., j.

107
Put b−j = c. Then the recursion relation ﬁrst gives b−j+1 = (h+ja3)c
√
2
(a1+ia2)√j , and the
same relation then determines bm+1 for m = −j + 1, . . . j −1. The relation for
m = j gives an eigenvalue equation for h, but we already know from Aa|v⟩= h|v⟩
that this has solutions h = −j, −j +1, . . ., j −1, j. Finally, |c| is determined from
 |bm|2 = 1. Thus, modulo an arbitrary phase factor, we have a unique ket vector
|v⟩determined from the basis vectors |m⟩, m = −j, . . ., j.
⊓⊔
Corollary 4.1 Proposition 4.1 of Sect.4.5.2 is valid for the spin/angular momen-
tum case. And in this case there is a one-to-one correspondence between states and
question-and-answer pairs.
Proof This follows here from the construction above, giving a solution depending
in a unique way upon a = (a1, a2, a3) on the unit sphere.
⊓⊔
Corollary 4.2 The epistemic ket vectors of Proposition 4.2 form a set in the Hilbert
space determined by h and by 2 independent real parameters.
Proof These simple epistemic states may be indexed by h and by a1, a2 and a3 =

1 −a2
1 −a2
2.
⊓⊔
In the spin 1/2 the unit ket vectors in the spin 1/2 case are determined by
the 2-dimensional Bloch sphere. Hence the following result is intuitive from
Corollary 4.2:
Proposition 4.3 For the spin 1/2 case the vectors of Proposition 4.2 give all unit
vectors in the Hilbert space of dimension 2.
Proof Let v0 be a ﬁxed 2-dimensional complex unit vector, e.g., v0 = (1, 0), and
let v be any complex vector of dimension 2. Then there is a unitary matrix M with
determinant 1 such that v = Mv0. It is well known (see, e.g., Ma (2007)) that
there is a homomorphism of the group SU(2) of unitary matrices with determinant
1 onto the 3-dimensional rotation group. Let R be the image of M under this
homomorphism. Fix a ﬁxed direction a0, let a = Ra0, and look at the ket vector
|a; +⟩. This gives a mapping from v to |a; +⟩. Changing a into −a in this argument
gives a mapping from the complex unit 2-vectors to the ket vectors |a; −⟩. By
Proposition 4.2 each ket vector |a; h⟩is a complex unit vector. Hence we have
established a one-to-one correspondence.
⊓⊔
For j > 1/2 the set of simple epistemic states for angular momenta is not closed
under linear combinations. As remarked in Sect. 4.5.2, however, each pure quantum
state can nevertheless be seen as the eigenstate of some operator; the problem is
only to associate this operator to a physically meaningful e-variable. For j > 1/2 it
is not enough to look at angular momentum components θa in various directions a.
Candidates for other physically meaningful e-variables may be, e.g., αθa + βθb for
a ̸= b, or more generally any f (θa, θb, θc, . . .).

4.5.4
Some Remarks
I consider the above results to give fairly strong arguments for the assertion
that very many quantum states, or more generally eigenvector spaces of quantum
operators, can be associated with question-and-answer pairs connected to accessible
conceptual variables in some context. This gives a clear interpretation of the state
vectors in the context of epistemic processes, where the conceptual variables are
called e-variables, but it is also relevant to other settings where quantum theory has
been found applicable, say quantum decision theory or cognitive models.
Superposition of quantum states can be introduced in my setting as follows: Take
as a point of departure the states |a; j⟩, each such state interpreted in the way that
we know that λa = ua
j for a maximally accessible variable λa. Then consider
another maximal variable λb and a hypothetical possible value ub
i for λb. Since

j |a; j⟩⟨a; j| = I, we have
|b; i⟩=

j
|a; j⟩⟨a; j|b; i⟩=

j
⟨a; j|b; i⟩|a; j⟩.
(4.48)
Here the corresponding operators Aa and Ab do not commute, and this is a fairly
general linear combination of states |a; j⟩. Such linear combinations will then be
state vectors. The state |b; i⟩may be a very hypothetical state, not coupled to the
observer’s concrete knowledge. Then (4.48) corresponds to a “do not know” state.
When λ is a continuous variable or even a vector variable, we can still interpret
the eigenspaces of the operator A as question “What is the value of λ?” together
with answer in terms of intervals or more generally sets for λ. This is related to the
spectral decomposition of A, which gives an orthogonal resolution of the identity
(recall (4.29))
I =

σ(A)
dE(λ).
(4.49)
This resolution of the identity is tightly coupled to the question “What is the
value of λ?”, and it implies projections related to indicators of intervals/sets C for λ
as
Π(C) =

σ(A)∩C
dE(λ).
(4.50)
The space V (C) upon which Π(C) projects can be interpreted as an answer “λ ∈C”
of this question. If this space is an eigenspace of A, we get an answer in terms of a
single eigenvalue.

4.5.5
The Epistemic Interpretation
Consider a physical system, and an observator or a set of communicating observa-
tors on this system. The physical variables that can be measured in this setting are
examples of accessible conceptual variables and are called e-variables here.
A maximally accessible variable θa admits values ua
j that are single eigenvalues
of the operator Aa, uniquely determined from θa. Let |a; j⟩be the eigenvector
associated with this eigenvalue. Then |a; j⟩can quite generally be connected to
the question “What is the value of θa?” together with the sharp answer “θa = ua
j.”
Note that such an interpretation is relevant for both the preparation phase and the
measurement phase of a physical system.
All this can be seen as the general epistemic interpretation of quantum states and
projection operators. It is related to the QBist interpretation but is more general. It
can also be seen as a concrete speciﬁcation of the Relational Quantum Mechanics
and of interpretations related to information. From a philosophical point of view,
it can be connected to the convivial solipsism basis advocated by Zwirn (2016).
There is a huge literature on interpretations of quantum theory. Some other of the
proposed interpretations also have relationships to this epistemic interpretation; see
a brief remark on this in the next section.
In (4.49) and (4.50) λ may be seen as a maximally accessible variable associated
with the operator A. If θ is another maximally accessible variable, it will be
associated with another operator B, and A and B will not be commuting. We can
then say that λ and θ are complementary variables in the sense of Bohr. More
precisely, it is the questions related to these variables that are complementary.
Variables/operators corresponding to the same question, but having different sharp
answers to this question, are equivalent in this respect.
In a physical context, Niels Bohr’s complementarity concept has been thoroughly
discussed by Plotnitsky (2013).
Here is Plotnitsky’s deﬁnition of complementarity:
(a) A mutual exclusivity of certain phenomena, entities, or conceptions
(b) The possibility of applying each one of them separately at any given point
(c) The necessity of using all of them at different moments for a comprehensive
account of the totality of phenomena that we consider
This deﬁnition points at the physical situation discussed above and has Niels
Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mechanics as a point of departure. However, in
my opinion the deﬁnition can also be carried over to a long range of macroscopic
phenomena or conceptions. In particular, the concept is useful in connection to
quantum cognitive modeling: Khrennikov (2010); Pothos and Busemeyer (2013);
Busemeyer and Bruza (2012) and in quantum decision theory, see Yukalov and
Sornette (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011) and Yukalov (2020). In this connection, the
accessible variable discussed above may be taken as a decision variable θa, chosen
from a possible set A of decision variables by a ∈A . This choice is a choice of
focusing. Finally, a concrete decision θa = u is chosen among the possible values

110

Towards Quantum Theory
that θa may take. This should be compared to more traditional decision theory,
which may be taken as a basis of both statistical inference and economic theory.
Going back to physics, it may be considered of some value to have an epistemic
interpretation that is not necessarily tied to a subjective Bayesian view as it is given
in QBism. Under such an epistemic interpretation, one may also give very simple
discussions of various “quantum paradoxes” like Schrödinger’s cat, Wigner’s friend,
and the two-slit experiment.
Example 1 (Schrödinger’s Cat) The discussion of this example concerns the state
of the cat just before the sealed box is opened. Is it half dead and half alive?
To an observer outside the box the answer is simply: “I do not know.” Any acces-
sible variable connected to this observer does not contain any information about the
status of life of the cat. But on the other hand—an imagined observer inside the box,
wearing a gas mask, will of course know the answer. The interpretation of quantum
mechanics is epistemic, not ontological, and it is connected to the observer. Both
observers agree on the death status of the cat once the box is opened.
Example 2 (Wigner’s Friend) Was the state of the system only determined when
Wigner learned the result of the experiment, or was it determined at some previous
point?
My answer to this is that at each point in time a quantum state is connected to
Wigner’s friend as an observer and another to Wigner, depending on the knowledge
that they have at that time. The superposition given by formal quantum mechanics
corresponds to a “do not know” epistemic state. The states of the two observers
agree once Wigner learns the result of the experiment.
Example 3 (The Two-slit Experiment) This is an experiment where all real and
imagined observers can communicate at each point of time, so there is always an
objective state.
Look ﬁrst at the situation when we do not know which slit the particle goes
through. This is a “do not know” situation. Any statement to the effect that the
particles somehow pass through both slits is meaningless. The interference pattern
can be explained by the fact that the particles are (nearly) in an eigenstate in the
component of momentum in the direction perpendicular to the slits in the plane
of the slits. If an observer ﬁnds out which slit the particles goes through, the state
changes into an eigenstate for position in that direction.

Concluding Remarks for Sect. 4.5
The notion of conceptual variables also has links to other interpretations of quantum
theory. Take for instance the classical Bohm interpretation, constructed from a
particle trajectory plus a pilot wave. These constructions are just conceptual
variables, but at least the full trajectory must be inaccessible. Or take the many-

Conceptual Variables, Decisions, and Communication between Observers

world/many minds interpretations: Here the different worlds must be considered as
connected to conceptual variables, but only one world is accessible.
Proposition 4.1 provides a straightforward interpretation of at least some states of
quantum theory. By the simple observation in Sect. 4.5.2 it is tempting to generalize
this to all state vectors.
Hence, by relying on arguments in this section, I will from now on largely,
when discussing epistemic processes, assume that every quantum state vector—or
more generally eigenvector space—may be associated with a question-and-answer
pair in the way described here. This is connected to a physical system, an
observer, and the conceptual variables that this observer may use to describe this
physical phenomenon. Several observers, when they communicate, may share some
conceptual variables. When they together shall try to understand this phenomenon,
they must use these shared conceptual variables. To these variables there correspond
operators on a Hilbert space, which may be a different Hilbert space than the one
used by a single observer. The states are related to a joint understanding of the
physical phenomenon in question.
4.6
Conceptual Variables, Decisions, and Communication
between Observers
Consider an actor A in some concrete situation at some time t, say that he is
planning to perform an experiment. In this situation he has a context τ and several
conceptual variables in his mind. Some of these, say θa for a in some index set A ,
are accessible. Assume the following: There are at least two conceptual variables θ1
and θ2 that are maximally accessible. There are transitive group actions gi ∈Gi on
the variable spaces ΩΘi for i = 1, 2. If A is a statistician, he either has some data
or is going to collect some data. Let zi be the data that are relevant for inference
on θi (i = 1, 2), and assume that these data have been reduced such that there is a
transitive group Gi∗acting on zi. Then one can assume that Gi∗for A induces the
group Gi by an homomorphism obtained from the statistical model.
As shown in Sect. 4.4.4, under some technical assumptions in this situation the
following holds: There is a Hilbert space H , and for each a ∈A an operator Aa
on H connected to the accessible variable θa. (If θa is not maximally accessible,
it can always be seen as a function of some maximally accessible variable, and we
can deﬁne an operator as in (4.30).)
Furthermore, according to Sect. 4.5.2, the following holds: If θ is a maximally
accessible variable taking a ﬁnite number of values, then each question “What is
the value of θ?” together with an imagined sharp answer “θ = uk” is associated
with a unique vector |vk⟩∈H , an eigenvector of the relevant Aθ corresponding
to the eigenvalue uk. If θ is not maximally accessible, the question-and-answer pair
is associated with an eigenspace of Aθ. If we are not sure of the answer, but have

112

Towards Quantum Theory
a probability distribution over answers, the question together with the probability
distribution can be associated with a density operator in H (see (4.32)).
Let us forget about the statistician for a moment (I will come back to him in
Chap. 6), but consider an arbitrary person A who in his mind has several conceptual
variables. Then, as I see it, this mind in some concrete situation can be modeled
by a Hilbert space H having the properties above. In particular, the statements of
the previous three paragraphs hold. I will also assume that A is in some epistemic
process; he wants to learn something from his situation, perhaps obtain some new
knowledge.
Later, A may be exposed to other situations, and his mind in one such situation
can be associated with another Hilbert space. A general way to see this may be that
A’s mind and his environments in general can be modeled by a big Hilbert space
H0, and when he is exposed to some speciﬁc situation, one must limit the model of
his mind to some H ⊂H0, determined by the conceptual variables that he has in
his mind in that situation.
In such a situation, A may also have the possibility to do some action, say an
action b in some set B. These actions are chosen by his conceptual variables, his
context at the moment τ, which also contains the information—data—he then has,
his goals as it may be formulated by himself, and his limitations, for instance other
persons and the actions they do.
So far for the description of a single actor. But people may communicate, share
a context, and also to some extent share conceptual variables. To take a very simple
example, say that some scientists want to do an experiment together, which may
involve taking measurements on some concrete moving particle. In their joint minds
they have as conceptual variables the position of the particle at some time t, and
the momentum of the particle at this time. These are both maximally accessible
variables. Together, the scientists must make a choice, whether to do an experiment
focusing on measuring the position or an experiment focusing on measuring the
momentum.
My theory, as developed in this chapter, is also valid for a group of commu-
nicating people, having a joint context and a joint set of conceptual variables. If
at least two of these conceptual variables are maximally accessible in some given
situation, one can under weak assumptions describe this situation for this group
of people by a Hilbert space H constructed from their joint conceptual variables.
Operators corresponding to each accessible conceptual variable may be deﬁned, and
if some conceptual variable takes a ﬁnite number of values, each of these values are
associated by a vector or by a space of vectors in the Hilbert space.
A single actor in such a situation may have to make a decision, choose some
action. And a group of communicating actors may make joint decisions, choosing
among the actions available to the group.
The actor himself or the set of actors may not be aware of all this theory. But the
whole situation may be observed by a knowledgeable observer D, in particular one
who knows quantum theory. He may also be thought of as knowing the contexts in
the situation by all actors, and perhaps which conceptual variables that are available
to each actor or to the group of the actors. On this background he might be able to

calculate probabilities connected to the actions and to possible measurements made
by the actors.
I will have this theoretical background in mind when discussing the Born formula
in the next chapter.

Chapter 5
Aspects of Quantum Theory
Abstract A number of themes related to quantum theory/quantum mechanics are
discussed in this chapter. First the basic theory is reviewed brieﬂy from several
angles. Then the discussion is specialized, ﬁrst to the qubit case and next to the
continuous conceptual variables position and momentum. A focused likelihood
principle is derived, and after that there is a discussion leading up to the Born rule.
Quantum measurements are discussed from my point of view, and a macroscopic
example is given. I discuss brieﬂy the Bell experiment. Arguments behind the
Schrödinger equation are given, and I try to argue against the QBist interpretation
in its most recent version. Finally, my whole approach towards quantum theory
is discussed and then summarized from the point of view of a general epistemic
setting.

Basic Quantum Theory
In Chap.4 I gave arguments for constructing a Hilbert space H , arguments based
on certain assumptions regarding conceptual variables in the mind of a single
actor or joint variables shared by a group of actors. In this chapter, I will partly
tune down these assumptions, and just see the Hilbert space as given. From this
basis, I will discuss various aspects of quantum theory. To begin with, I take as
a point of departure a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space H with kets |k⟩
being orthonormal basis vectors, and corresponding bras ⟨k|. The one-dimensional
predictors |k⟩⟨k| are deﬁned from this, and all operators on H are of the form
A =

k
uk|k⟩⟨k| with ⟨i|j⟩= δij.
(5.1)
This is equivalent to deﬁning the action of A on any vector of H :

Aspects of Quantum Theory
A fundamental assumption of quantum theory is that there to each physi-
cal system corresponds a Hilbert space H , and that there to each simple e-
variable/observable θ of this physical system corresponds an operator A of this
Hilbert space. Having an observer or a group of communicating observers in mind,
this is also argued for in Chap. 4. Basic operator theory is reviewed in Appendix B.
Assume ﬁrst that A has distinct eigenvalues. This corresponds to the case where
the corresponding conceptual variable is maximally accessible; see Chap. 4. Then
all eigenvectors of A deﬁne quantum states. In the general case, we can extend A by
taking into account auxiliary eigenvalues in such a way that the extended operator is
maximal, and let the states be the eigenvectors of this extended operator; see below.
All these states can be given an interpretation in terms of a focused question: “What
is the value of θ?” together with a deﬁnite answer: “θ = uk.” Often θ will be a
vector, so this question can be decomposed into several sub-questions.
Often also the discussion will involve several maximal e-variables θa, θb, . . ..
The state vector corresponding to θa = ua
k will then be called |a; k⟩.
Given a ket vector |k⟩there is an inﬁnity of operators A which have |k⟩as an
eigenvector. In many cases, there is at least one such operator which is physically
meaningful, i.e., is associated with some e-variable θ. In some cases, e.g., a speciﬁc
spin of an electron, this operator is unique in a deﬁnite way.
From this, all the features of elementary quantum mechanics follow except the
probability statements and the time development of states, which I will come back
to later. Quantum states that are not directly constructed as eigenvectors of any
physically meaningful operator can be found via the time dependent Schrödinger
equation; see Sect. 5.10, and also in some cases by considering physically meaning-
ful linear combination of state vectors; see below.
The operators can be multiplied as also discussed in Appendix B. The multi-
plication is associative, but not commutative. As usual, we deﬁne the commutator
as
[A, B] = AB −BA.
The adjoint operator A† is deﬁned such that the ket A†|k⟩corresponds to the bra
⟨k|A, in other words ⟨i|A†j⟩= ⟨iA|j⟩for all |i⟩, |j⟩. This A† can also be deﬁned
by complex conjugating the eigenvalues in the formula above. The observables
are deﬁned as the self-adjoint operators: A† = A, that is, the case where the
eigenvalues uk are real. In general one has (AB)† = B†A†. The possible values
of the observables are their eigenvalues, and the states are given by the ket vectors.
A smaller Hilbert space may be relevant when only a subsystem is considered,
but when the whole system is to be described, a larger Hilbert space is needed.
These considerations are highly relevant when considering several observers.
One single observer may have access to just a few subsystems. In addition, he
has his own context. From this context and from the whole situation, one can
deﬁne what is his accessible and inaccessible conceptual variables. In the same
way a group of several observers may through verbal communication arrive at
a common context, and from this context, and again from their whole situation,

5.1

one can deﬁne their accessible and inaccessible conceptual variables. Imagine that
these observers together observe a particular physical system, and consider the
corresponding Hilbert space, found from the conceptual variables.
Assumption 1 For a given physical system at some particular time, one can either
imagine an observer or a group of communicating observers for which assumptions
leading to the Hilbert space formulation are satisﬁed. In many cases, all real and
imagined observers agree on the physical observations, in which case the variable
values behind these observations are considered part of the ontic world.
It is important that for every physical system we can consider imagined
observers. All real and imagined observers may agree on observations like charge
or non-relativistic mass of a particle. For these observations, we do not need the
formalism of quantum mechanics. For other variables the construction of Chap. 4
applies, leading to a formal apparatus which is identical to that of quantum theory.
At any time, we can also imagine non-communicating observers. For each
observer then the general setting corresponding to the quantum formulation may
apply. Particular state vectors in each observer’s Hilbert space may then be linear
combinations of primitive state vectors of the form |a1; k1⟩⊗. . . ⊗|as; ks⟩, where
I here refrain from the assumption that the relevant e-variables are maximal. When
these cannot be reduced to a primitive form, they are called entangled state vectors.
Entangled state vectors play an important role in many discussions of quantum
mechanics, and I will come back to them brieﬂy below.
When the physical system available to an observer A contains a conceptual
variable which is not maximally accessible, and this variable corresponds to an
operator Aa = 
k ua
k|a; k⟩⟨a; k|, we can always imagine another observer B,
communicating with A, with an operator Bb = 
j vb
j |b; j⟩⟨b; j|, so that the
operator Aa ⊗Ba = 
k,j ua
kvb
j (|a; k⟩⊗|b; j⟩)(⟨a; k| ⊗⟨b; j|) corresponds to
a variable which is maximally accessible, i.e., has distinct eigenvalues.
Assumption 1 is assumed to hold for any physical system, and also for combina-
tions of physical systems. Through the imagined observers the construction of this
section can be carried out, and for each case a Hilbert space can be constructed.
Connected to any general physical system, one may have several e-variables θ
and corresponding operators A. There is well known theorem saying that, in my
formulation, θ1, . . . , θn are compatible, that is, there exists an e-variable λ such
that θi = ti(λ) for some functions ti if and only if the corresponding operators
commute:
[Ai, Aj] ≡AiAj −AjAi = 0 for all i, j.
(See Holevo 2001 or Ballentine 1998.) Compatible e-variables may in principle be
estimated simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy.
In an attempt to make all this a little more concrete, look again at the example of
spin/angular momentum of a particle, discussed in Sect. 4.4.7. With some change of
notation, which I hope the reader will excuse, let Jx, Jy, and Jz be the operators

120

Aspects of Quantum Theory
corresponding to spin in three orthogonal directions x, y, and z. In quantum
mechanical texts (see Messiah, 1969), it is shown that there is a constant c such
that these operators satisfy the commutation relations:
[Jx, Jy] = icJz, [Jy, Jz] = icJx, [Jx, Jz] = icJy.
This can also be proved fairly easily directly in my setting for the electron spin case
j = 1/2, in general using the geometry of SU(2). In standard quantum mechanics
c = ¯h/2, where ¯h is Planck’s constant. We will choose units here such that c = 1/2.
In great generality, commutation relations may be derived from group properties by
exploiting the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras; see for instance Barut
and Raczka (1985).
Several consequences of the above commutation relations are derived in standard
texts, for instance Messiah (1969). First it is shown that Jz commutes with J 2 =
J 2
x + J 2
y + J 2
z and that J 2 has eigenvalues of the form j(j + 1), where j is integer
or half integer. It is well known, see the discussion above, that commuting operators
can be simultaneously diagonalized. In terms of the corresponding e-variables
(θx, θy, θz) this means that the vector (∥θ∥2, θz) is accessible, where ∥θ∥2 =
θ2
x +θ2
y +θ2
z . Given j, the eigenvalues of Jz are of the form −j, −j +1, . . ., j −1, j
as also argued for in Sect. 4.4.7. Also, eigenvectors can be explicitly discussed.
We conclude from this that we have two possible situations:
(1) J 2 is known; more explicitly, the squared modulus ∥θ∥2 is known, and takes
one of the values j(j + 1). Then the situation is exactly as in Sect. 4.4.7.
(2) The squared modulus ∥θ∥2 is unknown. Then the operator J 2 ⊗Jz (taking
inﬁnitely many, but discrete values) can be diagonalized and can be understood
in terms of conceptual variables.
In conclusion, the introduction of conceptual variables does seem to be useful
for understanding what is going on in any case. Model reduction, going from a
non-discrete way of understanding to the discrete formulation used in quantum
mechanics, may be crucial here.
Let now, again with a slight change of notation J
= (Jx, Jy, Jz) be the
inaccessible total angular momentum of a system of particles where ∥J∥2 =
J(J + 1) is known. Assume that J is the sum of two spins j 1 and j2 where
∥j 1∥2 = j1(j1 + 1) and ∥j 2∥2 = j2(j2 + 1) are known. Let |mi⟩be the state
where jiz = mi for −ji ≤mi ≤ji. Then the state |M⟩where Jz = M can be
decomposed into
|M⟩=

m1m2
cMm1m2|m1⟩⊗|m2⟩.
The coefﬁcients cMm1m2, non-zero only for m1 + m2 = M, are called Clebsch–
Gordan coefﬁcients and are discussed in standard quantum mechanical texts like
Messiah (1969). Generalizations, only more technically involved, exist when J is
the sum of more than two spins or angular momenta. This is an important example

of a situation where new states are found by taking linear combinations of a basic
set of state vectors.
From elementary quantum mechanical texts, one can get the impression that all
linear combinations of state vectors in a Hilbert space are possible state vectors. This
is however only true under certain qualiﬁcations (I will come brieﬂy back to this in
connection to superselection rules later). Nevertheless, taking linear combinations
of state vectors leads to the introduction of interesting and important quantum
mechanical phenomena, in particular that of entanglement, which will be touched
upon in Sect. 5.8.
Superposition of quantum states can be introduced in my setting as follows:
Assume that we know a state |a; k⟩, that is, we know that θa = ua
k for a maximal
e-variable θa, and that we are interested in information about another maximal e-
variable θb. Since 
j |b; j⟩⟨b; j| = 1, we have
|a; k⟩=

j
|b; j⟩⟨b; j|a; k⟩=

j
⟨b; j|a; k⟩|b; j⟩.
(5.3)
In general, when the corresponding operators Aa and Ab do not commute, this
is a genuine linear combination of states |b; j⟩, and part of the interpretation in
my language is that we do not know the value of θb. A situation like this can be
illustrated by the two-slit experiment, see Sect. 4.5.5, and in many other settings.
However, there are also other situations than the one sketched above where linear
combinations of state vectors are of interest. In more generality, given a set of basis
vectors {|j⟩} for the Hilbert space, new state vectors of interest can be of the form
|ψ⟩=

j
cj|j⟩,
(5.4)
where {cj} is an arbitrary set of complex numbers such that 
j |cj|2 = 1.
To assume a state |a; k⟩is to assume perfect knowledge of the e-variable θa:
θa = ua
k. Such perfect knowledge is far from always available. In practice we may
have data za about the system, and use these data to obtain knowledge about θa. Let
us start with the Bayesian point of view. This assumes prior probabilities πa
k on the
values ua
k, and after the inference we have posterior probabilities πa
k (za). In either
case, we summarize this information in the density operator:
ρa =

k
πa
k |a; k⟩⟨a; k|.
Interpretation of the Density Operator ρa
(1) We have posed the question “What is the value of θa?” (2) We have speciﬁed
a prior or posterior probability distribution πa
k over the possible answers. The
probability for all possible answers to the question, formulated in terms of state
vectors, can be recovered from the density operator.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
A third possibility for the probability speciﬁcations is a conﬁdence distribution;
see Chap. 2 and references to this given there; I will also come back to this in
Chap. 6. For discrete θa the conﬁdence distribution function H a is connected to
a discrete distribution, which gives the probabilities πa
k . Extending the argument
of Xie and Singh (2013) to this situation, this should not be looked upon as a
distribution of θa, but a distribution for θa, to be used in the epistemic process.
Since the sum of the probabilities is 1, the trace (sum of eigenvalues, or
equivalently, sum of diagonal terms) of any density operator is 1. In the quantum
mechanical literature, a density operator is any positive operator with trace 1. In
terms of a set of basis vectors {|k⟩}, a density operator is an operator of the form
ρ =

k
πk|k⟩⟨k|,
where 
k πk = 1.
Lemma 1 A density operator corresponds to a pure state if and only if the trace of
its square is 1.
Proof trace((ρ)2) = 
k(πk)2 ≤
k πk = 1. Equality can hold here if and only if
only one πk is 1 and the rest 0. Then ρ is a one-dimensional projector, corresponding
to a single ket vector.
⊓⊔
A good modern introduction to quantum mechanics, in particular to the Hilbert
space formalism, is Ballentine (1998). Concepts and methods of quantum mechanics
are discussed in Peres (1993), and also in other, more recent books.

More on the Qubit Case: The Case of Dimension 2
Let us look closer on the case where the Hilbert space dimension is 2. One particular
case of this is the spin 1/2 particle, say the spin components of an electron. The
discussion here often starts with the Pauli spin operators
σx =
 0 1
1 0

, σy =
 0 −i
i 0

, σz =
1 0
0 −1

.
(5.5)
All of these have eigenvalues +1 and −1, the possible spin components in the x-
direction, y-direction, and z-direction, respectively. The corresponding eigenvectors
are (1 1)t and (1 −1)t for σx, (i −1)t and (i 1)t for σy and (1 0)t and (0 1)t for
σz. In an obvious way, each of these corresponds to a question-and-answer pair for
spin component.

5.2
More on the Qubit Case: The Case of Dimension 2
123
The Pauli spin operators are self-adjoint and satisfy
trace(σx) = trace(σy) = trace(σz) = 0;
σ 2
x = σ 2
y = σ 2
z = I;
σxσy = −σyσx = iσz, σyσz = −σzσy = iσx, σzσx = −σxσz = iσy.
Also, the four matrices I, σx, σy, and σz span all self-adjoint matrices, and one can
deﬁne the density operator
ρr = 1
2(I + rxσx + ryσy + rzσz) = 1
2(I + r · σ).
(5.6)
This is the most general operator with trace(ρr) = 1. A straightforward calculation
gives trace((ρr)2) = 1
2(1+∥r∥2). Thus in order that (5.6) shall be a density operator
(see the proof of Lemma 1), we must have ∥r∥≤1. The pure states (Lemma 1)
correspond to ∥r∥= 1. This gives a one-to-one correspondence between ket vectors
in the two-dimensional Hilbert space and real-valued three-dimensional vectors ∥r∥
of norm 1. This three-dimensional picture is called the Bloch sphere.
The Bloch sphere representation can also be used to describe measurements.
(For more details and for a far-reaching recent elaboration of this; see Aerts et al.
2016.) To this end, focus on the eigenstates of the e-variable that is measured.
More precisely, for an e-variable represented by the self-adjoint operator A =
u1P1 + u2P2, where Pk = |k⟩⟨k| is the projection associated with the ket vector
|k⟩, we can write: Pk = 1
2(I + nk · σ), where nk is the unit vector representing the
ket vector |k⟩on the Bloch sphere, k = 1, 2.
The two eigenvectors being orthogonal, we have P1P2
=
0, so that
trace(P1P2) =
1
2(1 + n1 · n2) = 0, implying n1 = −n2, i.e., the two vectors
representative of P1 and P2 must point in opposite directions.
In this picture, a ket vector correspondingto a vector n on the Bloch sphere can be
given the interpretation: We have asked the question: “What is the spin component
corresponding to n?” with the answer +1. The ket vector corresponding to a vector
−n is given the interpretation: “What is the spin component corresponding to −n?”
with the answer +1, or equivalently: “What is the spin component corresponding to
n?” with the answer −1.
In this way, we have a one-to-one correspondence between the ket vectors in a
two-dimensional Hilbert space and question-and-answer pairs for spin components.
This correspondence was proved in another way in Chap. 4.

Continuous E-variables: Phase Space
Consider the one-dimensional movement of a single non-relativistic particle in some
force ﬁeld, the particle having position ξ and momentum π at some given time.
Both ξ and π are e-variables and can be estimated by suitable experiments. But it
has been well known from the early days of quantum mechanics that it is impossible
to estimate the vector φ = (ξ, π) with arbitrary accuracy. Thus the point φ in the
phase space is an inaccessible conceptual variable.
I will ﬁrst concentrate in the position ξ. This is a continuous variable, so a state
cannot be deﬁned as simply as in the discrete case. Consider a ﬁxed conﬁdence
interval or credibility interval (ξ, ¯ξ) for this position. Either ξ lies in this interval or
it does not lie in this interval. In the ﬁrst case, the conﬁdence coefﬁcient/credibility
coefﬁcient of the interval can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by doing a suitable large
experiment. In the second case, the same coefﬁcient can be made arbitrarily close
to 0. Thus it is crucial by experiment, that is, by an epistemic process, to make a
choice between the two indicator variables:
I1(ξ) = I(ξ ∈(ξ, ¯ξ)),
I2(ξ) = I(ξ /∈(ξ, ¯ξ)).
Let Gξ be the translation group on the real line R. The invariant measure
corresponding to Gξ is the Lebesgue measure dξ, and I will deﬁne the Hilbert
space H
= L2(R, dξ). The indicator I1(ξ) is a function, and can be regarded
as an element of this space. The indicator I2(ξ) cannot be associated with H , but
this is not important since I2 = 1 −I1.
By letting ξ and ¯ξ vary, the ξ-state of the system can be deﬁned in terms of the
indicators I1. For ﬁxed ξ and ¯ξ this is a discrete e-variable taking values I1 = 0 and
I1 = 1. It is crucial in quantum mechanics that linear combinations of states deﬁned
by indicators and the limits of these also can be introduced as states. One way
they will emerge is through the time development of states through the Schrödinger
equation; see Sect. 5.10.
The approach I will take here is a limiting operation obtained through dividing
the real line into many intervals such that the width of each interval tends to
zero. Through this limiting process we can approximate any function f in H .
In traditional quantum mechanics, any such f is describing a state of the particle,
and f is called a wave function. I will not go into any interpretation of this here,
but just mention that there are interpretations trying to connect this to the theory
of stochastic processes; this is the content of the stochastic mechanics of Edward
Nelson (1967). I will discuss this later in connection to the Schrödinger equation,
but here I only address the limiting process. I will limit myself to a continuous f .
Thus for each n let ξn1 < ξn2 < . . . < ξnkn be a sequence of real numbers such
that
1. ξn1 →−∞and ξnkn →∞as n →∞.
2. δn = ξn,i+1 −ξni is constant for i = 1, . . . , kn −1 and tends to 0 as n →∞.

5.3
Continuous E-variables: Phase Space
125
Let Ini(ξ) = I(ξ ∈[ξni, ξn,i+1)) for i = 1, 2, . . . , kn−1. For a given continuous
function f ∈H, deﬁne the step function approximation fn by fn(ξ) = f (ξni) for
ξni ≤ξ < ξn,i+1 when i = 1, . . ., kn −1; fn(ξ) = 0 for ξ < ξn1 and for ξ ≥ξnkn.
Thus fn(ξ) = 
i f (ξni)Ini(ξ), a linear function of indicators. Finally, on the space
of such step functions deﬁne the operator An by
Anfn(ξ) =

i
ξnif (ξni)Ini(ξ).
(5.7)
The interpretation of (5.7) is as follows: Approximate ξ by ξni when ξ ∈
[ξni, ξn.i+1) (and neglect its value when ξ < ξn1 or ξ ≥ξnkn; this is assumed
to have negligible probability/conﬁdence coefﬁcient). This approximate variable is
discrete, so we can use the theory of Sect. 5.1. The indicators Ini can be regarded
as an orthonormal set of ket vectors for this approximate variable for a suitable
normalization of the Lebesgue measure. Then (5.7) is equivalent to (5.2) of Sect. 5.1
with |i⟩= Ini(ξ) constituting an orthonormal basis for a Hilbert space Hn of step
functions, a subspace of H. Thus An is the quantum mechanical operator of the
discrete e-variable.
It is of interest to see what happens when n tends to ∞. The following basic
result is proved in Appendix C.
Theorem 5.1 Assume that f is a continuous function in H such that the function k
deﬁned by k(ξ) = ξf (ξ) satisﬁes ∥k∥< ∞. Then ∥fn−f ∥→0 and ∥Anfn−k∥→
0 as n →∞.
In this speciﬁc sense, the operator A corresponding to the e-variable ξ can be said
to be the operator of multiplying with ξ. By Theorem 5.1 it is motivated as such an
operator deﬁned on all continuous f in H such that

|ξf (ξ)|2dξ < ∞.
The operator A is an unbounded operator, and as such it must always have a
limited domain of deﬁnition D(A). There is a very large and advanced mathematical
theory on unbounded operators; see for instance Murphy (1990) or Bing-Ren
(1992).
The spectral theorem, see Hall (2013), is valid also for the operator A. The
spectral measure for an interval I = |ξ1, ξ2] is given by E(I)f (ξ) = f (ξ) for
ξ1 ≤ξ ≤ξ2 and E(I)f (ξ) = 0 for ξ outside the interval. This E(I) is the operator
of multiplying with the indicator function of the interval. The spectral measure will
be important when considering general versions of the Born formula; see Sects. 5.6
and 5.14.
So far I have considered the position ξ. A completely parallel discussion can
be made on the momentum π in the Hilbert space H π = L2(S , dπ), where S
is the line where π varies. Thus the operator B corresponding to momentum π in
this space is multiplication by π with domain of deﬁnition D(B) = {f ∈H π :

|πf (π)|2dπ < ∞.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
As in the discrete case, it is important to have everything described in one Hilbert
space, so we need a unitary transformation from H π to H . For this case, we use
the Fourier transform. If f ∗∈H π, we deﬁne the corresponding f ∈H by
(Uf ∗)(ξ) = f (ξ) =
1
√
2 · 3.14

exp(i ξπ
¯h )f ∗(π)dπ,
where ¯h is Planck’s constant, which has the correct unit of measurement. One point
here is that this unitary transformation does not transform indicator variables into
indicator variables, so there is no confusion between simple π-states and simple
ξ-states. The inverse transformation is given by
(U†f )(π) = f ∗(π) =
1
√
2 · 3.14

exp(−i ξπ
¯h )f (ξ)dξ.
These two equations may be considered as the continuous analogues of (5.3).
By partial integration, one can show that the operator C = UBU† corresponding
to B in H is given by −i ¯h d
dξ with domain of deﬁnition D(C) given by the set of
differentiable f such that

|f ′(ξ)|2dξ < ∞. It follows that when f ∈D(A) ∩
D(C) we have (AC −CA)f (ξ) = i ¯hf (ξ), so A and C do not commute. Hence
by the brief discussion of commutation relations in Sect. 5.1, ξ and π cannot be
estimated simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy, in agreement with observed fact.
From the commutation relation, Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation can be proved:
From any estimators ξ and π we have std(ξ)std(π) > ¯h/2. For a derivation, see
standard quantum mechanical texts or Holevo (2001). But, to be precise, I am now
anticipating the inference theory which will be discussed in later sections and in
Chap. 6.
5.4
A Link to Statistical Inference
In this section, I again assume the discrete quantum formulation of Sect. 5.1. We can
for instance think of a spin component in a ﬁxed direction to be determined.
Assume now that the quantum mechanical system is prepared in some state and
that we want to do an experiment related to the unknown e-variable θb. Given then
the focused question b, the e-variable θb plays the role similar to a parameter in
statistical inference. Inference can be done by preparing many independent units
in the same state. Inference is then made from data zb. All inference theory that
one ﬁnds in standard texts like (Lehmann and Casella, 1998) applies. In particular,
the concepts of unbiasedness, equivariance, average risk optimality, minimaxity,
and admissibility apply. None of these concepts is much discussed in the physical
literature, ﬁrst because measurements there are often considered as perfect, at least
in elementary texts, secondly because, when measurements are considered in the
physical literature, they are mostly discussed in other terms.

5.4
A Link to Statistical Inference
127
Whatever kind of inference we make on θb, we can take as a point of departure
the statistical model and the generalized likelihood principle of Sect. 3.2.4. Hence
after an experiment is done, and given some context τ, all evidence on θb is
contained in the likelihood p(zb|τ, θb), where zb is the data relevant for inference
on θb, also assumed discrete. This is summarized in the likelihood effect:
F b(ub; zb, τ) =

j
p(zb|τ, θb = ub
j)|b; j⟩⟨b; j|.
Interpretation of the likelihood effect F b(zb, τ):
(1) We have posed some inference question on the accessible e-variable θb. (2)
We have speciﬁed the relevant likelihood for the data. The question itself and the
likelihood for all possible answers of the question, formulated in terms of state
vectors, can be recovered from the likelihood effect.
The likelihood effect is closely connected to the concept of an operator valued
measure; see Sect. 5.7 below.
Since the focused question assumes discrete data, each likelihood is in the range
0 ≤p ≤1. In the quantum mechanical literature, an effect is any operator with
eigenvalues in the range [0, 1].
Some qualiﬁcations must be made relative to the above interpretation, however,
if we want to be precise. We have the freedom to redeﬁne the e-variable in the
case of coinciding eigenvalues in the likelihood effect, that is, if p(zb|τ, θb =
ub
j) = p(zb|τ, θb = ub
l ) for some j, l. An extreme case is the likelihood effect
F(ub; zb, τ) = I, where all the likelihoods are 1, that is, the probability of z is 1
under any considered model.
We have the following mathematical result on the likelihood effects:
Proposition 5.1 Let two experiments b and c be given together with two data points
zb and zc of these experiments. Assume that b and c are such that
F b(ub; zb, τ) = F c(uc; zc, τ).
(5.8)
Then we can order the states such that
(1) p(zb|τ, θb = ub
j) = p(zc|τ, θc = uc
j) for each j.
(2) Introduce the class of indices Ci such that p(zb|τ, θb = ub
k) = p(zb|τ, θb =
ub
l ) whenever k, l ∈Ci, and these likelihoods are different when k and l belong
to different Ci-classes, similarly Di for p(zc|τ, θc = uc
k). Then we have

k∈Ci
|b; k⟩⟨b; k| =

k∈Di
|c; k⟩⟨c; k|
for all i.
On the other hand, if (1) and (2) are satisﬁed, then (5.8) holds.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
The last part is fairly trivial. The direct part is proved in Appendix C.
Return now to the generalized likelihood principle of Sect. 3.2.4. Recall that this
principle follows from the very reasonable conditionality principle and sufﬁciency
principle, and that the principle itself is fairly reasonable in our setting, where
we condition upon the context τ. In statistics, the likelihood principle says the
following: If two experiments have proportional likelihood, with constant of
proportionality independent of the parameter, they produce the same experimental
evidence about the parameter. Here experimental evidence is left undeﬁned. In my
approach towards quantum mechanics, where one focuses on a speciﬁc question b,
we must in addition demand that this focused question is the same; that is, the set of
corresponding projections must be the same.
The following principle follows:
The Focused Generalized Likelihood Principle (FGLP) Consider two potential
experiments b and c in some setting with equivalent contexts τ, and assume that the
inaccessible conceptual variable φ is the same in both experiments. Suppose that
the two observations zb
1 and zc
2 have equal likelihood effects in the two experiments.
Then
(A) The questions posed in the two experiments are equivalent in the sense that one
can use the same Hilbert space H to describe the results of the experiments,
and that the corresponding set of eigenvector spaces (i.e., the orthogonal
resolution of the identity) are equal. This implies a one-to-one relation between
the e-variables θb and θc.
(B) The two observations produce equivalent experimental evidence on the relevant
e-variables in this context and given this question.
Proposition 5.2 The focused generalized likelihood principle follows from the
generalized likelihood principle of Sect. 3.2.4.
Proof The proposition is trivial if we know that the e-variables are the same in
the two experiments. If not, we have a situation where Eq. (5.8) holds. Then θb-
operator=  ub
kΠb
k , θc-operator=  uc
kΠc
k , where the equality of the projection
operators after a suitable ordering follows from Proposition 5.5, (2). The eigenvalues
ub
k are all different, similarly the eigenvalues uc
k. These are the answers to the
questions connected to θb and θc; the questions are equivalent since the set of
projection operators coincides. The conclusion (B) follows from Proposition 5.5,
(1) and the ordinary likelihood principle.
⊓⊔
Remark Strictly speaking, this proof uses the assumption that p(zb|τ, θb = ub
k =
p(zb|τ, θb = ub
j) implies ub
k = ub
j, and similarly for zc. This is in agreement with
the arbitrariness of θb in relation to F b discussed above. Below, in the proof of
Born’s formula, I will use FGLP in perfect experiments, where observations are
equal to parameter values, and there this assumption is trivial.
Two contexts are considered equivalent if they are one-to-one functions of each
other. The principle FGLP says that both the question posed and the experimental
evidence are functions of the likelihood effect and the context of the experiment.

5.5
Rationality and Experimental Evidence
129
5.5
Rationality and Experimental Evidence
Throughout this section and the next one, I will consider a ﬁxed context τ and a
ﬁxed epistemic setting in this context. The inaccessible conceptual variable is φ,
and I assume that the accessible e-variables θb take a discrete set of values. Let
the data behind the potential experiment connected to θb be zb, also assumed to
take a discrete set of values. I will assume throughout this section and the next
one that an experimentalist B is in such a context partly determined by the fact
that he previously has performed an perfect experiment connected to a maximally
accessible conceptual variable θa and obtained the answer θa = uk, so that his state
can be described by a Hilbert space H and a vector |a; k⟩in H .
So let a single experimentalist B be in this situation, and let all conceptual
variables be attached to B, although he also has the possibility to receiving
information from others through part of the context τ. He has the choice of doing
different experiments b, and he also has the choice of choosing different models
for his experiment through his likelihood pB(zb|τ, θb). The experiment and the
model, hence the likelihood, should be chosen before the data are obtained. All
these choices are summarized in the likelihood effect F b, a function of the at
present unknown data zb. For use after the experiment, he should also choose a good
estimator 
θb, and he may also have to choose some loss function, but the principles
behind these latter choices will be considered as part of the context τ.
If B chooses to do a Bayesian analysis, the estimator should be based on a
prior πB(θb|τ). We assume that he is trying to be as rational as possible in all
his choices, and that this rationality is connected to his loss function or to other
criteria. What should be meant by experimental evidence, and how should it be
measured? As a natural choice then, let the experimental evidence that we are
seeking be the posterior probability for some ﬁxed value of θb, given the data. From
the experimentalist B’s point of view this is given by:
q = pb
B(θb = ub
j|zb, τ) =
pB(zb|τ, θb = ub
j)πB(θb = ub
j|τ)

i pb
B(zb|τ, θb = ub
i )πB(θb = ub
i |τ)
,
assuming the likelihood chosen by B and B’s prior πB for θb.
Some Bayesians claim that their own philosophy is the only one which is
consistent with the likelihood principle. For my own view on this, see below
and also comments in Sect. 3.4 and at the end of Sect. 2.1.3. In a non-Bayesian
analysis, we can let the concept of experimental evidence be tied to the conﬁdence
distribution, given the context, see Sect. 2.1.3; see also the discussion of conﬁdence
probabilities/ﬁducial probabilities in Chap.6. This may also give a conclusion in
terms of a probability, in this case an epistemic probability, a concept to be discussed
in more details later. Also in such an analysis we must assume B to be as rational as
possible.
In any case, we ﬁx b and j from now on, and take q = qb
j = P(θb = ub
j|data),
an epistemic probability.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
I have to make precise in some way what is meant by the rationality of the
experimentalist B. He has to make many difﬁcult choices on the basis of uncertain
knowledge. His actions can partly be based on intuition, partly on experience from
similar situations, partly on a common scientiﬁc culture, and partly on advices from
other persons. These other persons will in turn have their intuition, their experience,
and their scientiﬁc education. Often B will have certain explicitly formulated
principles on which to base his decisions, but sometimes he may have to dispense
with some of the principles. In the latter case, he has to rely on some “inner voice,”
a conviction which tells him what to do.
So in the case where B cannot himself be seen as a perfectly rational Bayesian, a
case that I will concentrate on below, I will formalize this by introducing a perfectly
rational superior actor D, to which all these principles, experiences, and convictions
can be related. I will assume that B in his actions is inspired by D, so in this sense,
D has some inﬂuence on B’s decisions. I may assume that D has priors, so that he
can do a Bayesian analysis. These priors can be based on symmetry considerations,
but also on other considerations. The experimental evidence will then be deﬁned
as the a posteriori probability of the e-variable θb from D’s point of view, say the
probability q that θb takes some ﬁxed value ub
j, given the data. By the FGLP this
must again be a function of the likelihood effect F b.
B’s experimental evidence, related to D = q(F b(ub; zb, τ))
(5.9)
under the assumption that the experiment connected to some e-variable θb is to be
done.
Alternatively, I may also assume that D is a frequentist, and that he has epistemic
probabilities connected to θb as found from a conﬁdence distribution. Again, by the
focused likelihood principle, these epistemic probabilities must be of the form (5.9).
In any case, for the derivation of Born’s formula below, I will make one more
crucial assumption: q as deﬁned here gives the real probability that θb takes the
ﬁxed value ub
j in the given context.
The superior actor D represents the scientiﬁc ideals of the experimentalist B, and
my main point is that D should be perfectly rational.
In this book, I have not tried to develop a theory of decisions. In Sect. 1.3 I
have referred to the Quantum Decision Theory of Yukalov and Sornette, which
is particularly nicely formulated in Yukalov and Sornette (2010, 2014). Here one
must be careful, however. Quantum Decision Theory takes its departure in the
ordinary mathematical formulation of quantum theory, in particular in Born’s rule
for calculating probabilities. Using this theory here, where I am preparing to derive
Born’s rule, will lead to circular reasoning. Instead I will now take decision as a
primitive concept.
An important point is that decisions made by our minds are not the same
as straightforward computerlike calculations. Human decisions are based on the
functioning of and the interplay between conscious and subconscious processes in
the brain.

5.5
Rationality and Experimental Evidence
131
As said, in a scientiﬁc connection we assume that D is perfectly rational. This
can be formalized mathematically by considering a hypothetical betting situation
for D against a bookie, nature N. A similar discussion was recently done using
a more abstract language by Hammond (2011). But note: I do not see any human
scientist, including myself, as being perfectly rational in all situations. We can try
to be as rational as possible, but we have to rely on some underlying rational ideals
that partly determine our actions.
So let the hypothetical odds of a given bet for D be (1 −q)/q to 1, where q is
the probability as deﬁned by (5.9). This odds speciﬁcation is a way to make precise
that, given the context τ and given the question b, the bettor’s probability that the
experimental result takes some value, say ub
j, is given by q: For a given utility
measured by x, the bettor D pays in an amount qx—the stake—to the bookie. After
the experiment, the bookie pays out an amount x—the payoff—to the bettor if the
result of the experiment takes the value θb = ub
j, otherwise nothing is payed.
The rationality of D is formulated in terms of
The Dutch Book Principle No choice of payoffs in a series of bets shall lead to a
sure loss for the bettor.
For a related use of the same principle, see Caves et al. (2002).
Assumption 2 Consider in the context τ an epistemic setting where the FGLP
is satisﬁed, and the whole situation is observed by an experimentalist B whose
decisions are inﬂuenced by a superior actor D as described above. Assume that
D’s probabilities q given by (5.9) are taken as the experimental evidence, and that
D can be seen to be rational in agreement with the Dutch book principle.
A situation where Assumption 2 holds will be called a rational epistemic setting.
It will be assumed to be implied by essential situations of quantum mechanics. Later
I will discuss whether or not it also can be coupled to certain macroscopic situations.
Theorem 5.2 Assume a rational epistemic setting, and assume a ﬁxed context τ.
Let F1 and F2 be two likelihood effects in this setting, and assume that F1 + F2 also
is an effect. Then the experimental evidences, taken as the epistemic probabilities
related to the data of the performed experiments, satisfy
q(F1 + F2|τ) = q(F1|τ) + q(F2|τ).
Proof The result of the theorem is obvious, without making Assumption 2, if F1 and
F2 are likelihood effects connected to experiments on the same e-variable θb. We
will prove it in general. Consider then two experiments 1 and 2, 1 with e-variable θb
and likelihood effect F1, and 2 with e-variable θc and likelihood effect F2, and let B
choose between these two experiments. Let z be the data of the chosen experiment,
and let the corresponding posterior probabilities/conﬁdence probabilities connected
to D be q1 = P(θb = ub
j|z, τ) = q(F1|τ) and q2 = P(θc = uc
k|z, τ) = q(F2|τ)
for some j and k.

132

Aspects of Quantum Theory
Assume that B does a randomized choice: With an unbiased coin, he makes the
choice between the experiments 1 or 2. The likelihood effect connected to the whole
experiment, including the coin toss, is (F1 + F2)/2.
Let q0 be the posterior probability/conﬁdence probability for D connected to this
full experiment, including the randomization. One might perhaps argue tentatively
at once that q0 must be equal to (q1+q2)/2, but I will show in detail that this follows
from the Dutch Book Principle.
Let D make his bets, one for the experiment 1, one for the experiment 2, and
one for the full randomized experiment. Let the corresponding payoffs chosen by
Nature be x1, x2, and x0. Imagine that this, including the randomization, is repeated
a large number of times.
If experiment 1 occurs in the randomization, the payoff for the randomized
experiment is replaced by the expected payoff x0/2, similarly if experiment 2
occurs. The net expected amount the bettor receives is then
x1 + 1
2x0 −q1x1 −q2x2 −q0x0 = (1 −q1)x1 −q2x2 −(1 −2q0)1
2x0
if experiment 1 is done and the conclusion is θb = ub
j,
x2 + 1
2x0 −q1x1 −q2x2 −q0x0 = −q1x1 −(1 −q2)x2 −(1 −2q0)1
2x0
if experiment 2 is done and the conclusion is θc = uc
k,
−q1x1 −q2x2 −2q0 · 1
2x0 otherwise.
This conclusion may be drawn from many repeated experiments.
The payoffs (x1, x2, x0) can be chosen by nature N in such a way that it leads to
sure loss for the bettor D if not the determinant of this system is zero:
0 =

1 −q1

1 −2q0
−q1
1 −q2 1 −2q0
−q1
−q2
−2q0

= q1 + q2 −2q0.
Thus we must have
q(1
2(F1 + F2)|τ) = 1
2(q(F1|τ) + q(F2|τ)).
If F1 + F2 is an effect, the common factor 1
2 can be removed by changing the
likelihoods, and the result follows.

The Born Formula
133
Corollary 5.1 Assume a rational epistemic setting in the context τ. Let F1, F2,
...be likelihood effects in this setting, and assume that F1 + F2 + . . . also is an
effect. Then
q(F1 + F2 + . . . |τ) = q(F1|τ) + q(F2|τ) + . . . .
Proof The ﬁnite case follows immediately from Theorem 5.2. Then the inﬁnite case
follows from monotone convergence.
⊓⊔
The result of this section is quite general. In particular, the loss function and any
other criterion for the success of the experiments are arbitrary. So far I have assumed
that the choice of experiment b is given, which implies that it is the same for B and
for D. However, the result also applies to the following different situation: Let B
have some deﬁnite purpose for his experiment, and to achieve that purpose, he has
to choose the question b in a clever manner, as rationally as he can. Assume that this
rationality is formalized through the actor D, who has the ideal likelihood effect
F and the experimental evidence q(F|τ). If two such questions can be chosen, the
result of Theorem 5.2 holds, with essentially the same proof.
5.6
The Born Formula
5.6.1
The Basic Formula
Born’s formula is the basis for all probability calculations in quantum mechanics. In
textbooks it is usually stated as a separate axiom, but it has also been argued for by
using various sets of assumptions; see Helland (2008) and Campanella et al. (2020)
for some references. In fact, the ﬁrst argument for the Born formula, assuming
that there is an afﬁne mapping from set of density functions to the corresponding
probability functions, is due to von Neumann (1927) (see Busch et al., 2016,
p. 201). In Helland (2006, 2008, 2010) the formula was proved under rather strong
assumptions. Here I will use assumptions which are as weak as possible; I will base
the discussion upon the result of Sect. 5.5.
I begin with a very elegant recent theorem by Busch (2003). For completeness I
reproduce the proof for the ﬁnite-dimensional case in Appendix D.
Let in general H be any separable Hilbert space. Recall that an effect F is any
operator on the Hilbert space with eigenvalues in the range [0, 1]. A generalized
probability measure μ is a function on the effects with the properties
(1) 0 ≤μ(F) ≤1 for all F,
(2) μ(I) = 1,
(3) μ(F1 + F2 + . . .) = μ(F1) + μ(F2) + . . . whenever F1 + F2 + . . . ≤I.

134

Aspects of Quantum Theory
Theorem 5.3 (Busch 2003) Any generalized probability measure μ is of the form
μ(F) = trace(ρF) for some density operator ρ.
It is now easy to see that q(F|τ) on the ideal likelihood effects of Sect. 5.5 is
a generalized probability measure if Assumption 2 holds: (1) follows since q is
a probability; (2) since F = I implies that the likelihood is 1 for all values of
the e-variable; ﬁnally (3) is a consequence of the corollary of Theorem 5.2. Hence
there is a density operator ρ = ρ(τ) such that p(z|τ) = trace(ρ(τ)F) for all ideal
likelihood effects F = F(z). This is a result which is valid for all experiments.
The problem of deﬁning a generalized probability on the set of effects is also
discussed in Busch et al. (2016).
Deﬁne now a perfect experiment as one where the measurement uncertainty can
be disregarded. The quantum mechanical literature operates very much with perfect
experiments which result in well-deﬁned states |j⟩. From the point of view of
statistics, if, say the 99% conﬁdence or credibility region of θb is the single point ub
j,
we can infer approximately that a perfect experiment has given the result θb = ub
j.
In our epistemic setting then: We have asked the question: “What is the value of
the accessible e-variable θb?”, and are interested in ﬁnding the probability of the
answer θb = ub
j through a perfect experiment. If ub
j is a non-degenerate eigenvalue
of the operator corresponding to θb, this is the probability of a well-deﬁned state
|b; j⟩. Assume now that this probability is sought in a setting deﬁned as follows:
We have previous knowledge of the answer θa = ua
k of another maximal question:
“What is the value of θa?” That is, we know the state |a; k⟩. (ua
k is non-degenerate.)
These two experiments, the one leading to |a; k⟩and the one leading to |b; j⟩,
are assumed to be performed in equivalent contexts τ.
Theorem 5.4 (Born’s Formula) Assume a rational epistemic setting. In the above
situation we have
P(θb = ub
j|θa = ua
k) = |⟨a; k|b; j⟩|2.
Proof By Theorem 4.5 both the e-variable θa and the e-variable θb have operators
with non-degenerate eigenvalues. Fix j and k, let |v⟩be either |a; k⟩or |b; j⟩, and
consider likelihood effects of the form F = |v⟩⟨v|. This corresponds in both cases
to a perfect measurement of a maximally accessible parameter with a deﬁnite result.
By Theorem 5.3 there exists a density operator ρa,k = 
i πi(τ a,k)|i⟩⟨i| such that
q(F|τ a,k) = ⟨v|ρa,k|v⟩, where πi(τ a,k) are non-negative constants adding to 1.
Consider ﬁrst |v⟩= |a; k⟩. For this case, one must have 
i πi(τ a,k)|⟨i|a; k⟩|2 =
1 and thus 
i πi(τ a,k)(1 −|⟨i|a; k⟩|2) = 0. This implies for each i that either
πi(τ a,k) = 0 or |⟨i|a; k⟩| = 1. Since the last condition implies |i⟩= |a; k⟩(modulus
of an irrelevant phase factor), and this is a condition which can only be true for one i,
it follows that πi(τ a,k) = 0 for all other i than this one, and that πi(τ a,k) = 1 for this
particular i. Summarizing this, we get ρa,k = |a; k⟩⟨a; k|, and setting |v⟩= |b; j⟩,
Born’s formula follows, since q(F|τ a,k) in this case is equal to the probability of
the perfect result θb = ub
j.
⊓⊔

5.6.2
Consequences
Here are three easy consequences of Born’s formula:
1. If the context of the system is given by the state |a; k⟩, and Ab is the
operator corresponding to the e-variable θb, then the expected value of a perfect
measurement of θb is ⟨a; k|Ab|a; k⟩.
2. If the context is given by a density operator ρ, and A is the operator correspond-
ing to the e-variable θ, then the expected value of a perfect measurement of θ is
trace(ρA). This is the formula used in Postulate 2 of Sect. 1.5.6.
3. In the same situation the expected value of a perfect measurement of f (θ) is
trace(ρf (A)).

⊓⊔
These results give an extended interpretation of the operator A compared to what
I gave in Chap.4: There is a simple formula for all expectations in terms of the
operator. On the other hand, the set of such expectations determine the state of the
system. Also on the other hand: If A is specialized to the operator of an indicator
function, we get back Born’s formula, so the consequences are equivalent to this
formula.
A consequence of 3 above is that θ = θb does not need to be maximal in order
that a Born formula should be valid; see also below.
As an application of Born’s formula, we give the transition probabilities for
electron spin. Throughout this book, we will, for a given direction a, deﬁne the
e-variable θa as +1 if the measured spin component by a perfect measurement for
the electron is +¯h/2 in this direction, θa = −1 if the component is −¯h/2. Assume
that a and b are two directions in which the spin component can be measured.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
Proposition 5.2 For electron spin we have
P(θb = ±1|θa = +1) = 1
2(1 ± cos(a · b)).
This is proved in several textbooks, for instance Holevo (2001), from Born’s
formula. A similar proof using the Pauli spin matrices is also given in Helland
(2010).
5.6.3
Perfect Measurements
Measurements of e-variables will be treated in Sect. 5.7, but ﬁrst we will look at
the simpler case of a perfect measurement. Assume that we know the state |ψ⟩of a
system, and that we want to measure a new e-variable θb. This can be discussed by
means of the projection operators b
j = |b; j⟩⟨b; j|. First observe that by a simple
calculation from Born’s formula
P(θb = ub
j|ψ) = ∥b
j|ψ⟩∥2.
(5.10)
It is interesting that (Shrapnel et al., 2017) recently simultaneously derived both
the Born rule and the well known collapse rule from a knowledge-based perspective.
I will say more about the collapse rule later, but in this subsection I will just assume
this derivation as given. Then, after a perfect measurement θb = ub
j has been
obtained, the state changes to
|b; j⟩=
b
j|ψ⟩
∥b
j|ψ⟩∥
.
Successive measurements are often of interest. We ﬁnd
P(θb = ub
j and then θc = uc

j|ψ⟩∥2.
(5.11)
In the case with multiple eigenvalues, the formulae above are still valid, but the
projectors above must be replaced by projectors upon eigenspaces. One can show
that (5.10) then gives a precise version of Born’s rule for this case.
Proof Look ﬁrst at the case with unique eigenvalues. Then Born’s rule says
P(θb = ub
j|ψ) = ⟨ψ|b; j⟩⟨b; j|ψ⟩.

5.6
The Born Formula
137
Let then the eigenvalues move towards coincidence. Let Ck = {j : ub
j = vb
k}. Then
by continuity from the previous equation we get
P(θb = vb
k|ψ) =

j∈Ck
⟨ψ|b; j⟩⟨b; j|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|b
k|ψ⟩= ∥b

⊓⊔
Note that in general P(θb = ub
j and then θc = uc
i |ψ) ̸= P(θc = uc
i and then
θb = ub
j|ψ). Measurements do not necessarily commute.
5.6.4
A Macroscopic Example
A very relevant question is now: Are all these results, including Born’s formula, by
necessity conﬁned to the microworld? Recently, physicists have become interested
in larger systems where quantum mechanics is valid, see Vedral (2011). Of even
more interest are the quantum models of cognition, see Pothos and Busemeyer
(2013). As we have deﬁned it, there is nothing microscopic about the epistemic
setting. It might well be that the rationality Assumption 2 also is valid for some
larger scale systems. The following example illustrates the point.
Example 1 In a medical experiment, let μa, μb, μc, and μd be continuous inacces-
sible parameters, the hypothetical effects of treatment a, b, c, and d, respectively.
Assume that the focus of the experiment is to compare treatment b with the
mean effect of the other treatments, which is supposed to give the parameter
1
3(μa + μc + μd). One wants to do a pairwise experiment, but it turns out that
the maximal parameter which can be estimated, is
θb = sign(μb −1
3(μa + μc + μd)).
(Imagine for example that one has four different ointments against rash. A patient
is treated with ointment b on one side of his back; a mixture of the other ointments
on the other side of his back. It is only possible to observe which side improves
best, but this observation is assumed to be very accurate. One can in principle do
the experiment on several patients, and select out the patients where the difference
is clear.) This experiment is done on a selected set of experimental units, on whom
it is known from earlier accurate experiments that the corresponding parameter
θa = sign(μa −1
3(μb + μc + μd))
takes the value +1. In other words, one is interested in the probabilities
π = P(θb = +1|θa = +1).

138

Aspects of Quantum Theory
Consider ﬁrst a Bayesian approach. Natural priors for μa, . . . , μd are indepen-
dent N(ν, σ 2) with the same ν and σ. By location and scale invariance, there is
no loss in generality by assuming ν = 0 and σ = 1. Then the joint prior of
ζ a = μa −1
3(μb + μc + μd) and ζ b = μb −1
3(μa + μc + μd) is multinormal with
mean 0 and covariance matrix

.
A numerical calculation from this gives
π = P(ζ b > 0|ζ a > 0) ≈0.43.
This result can also be assumed to be valid when σ →∞, a case which in some
sense can be considered as independent objective priors for μa, . . . , μd.
Now consider a rational epistemic setting for this experiment. Since again scale
is irrelevant, a natural group on μa, . . . , μd is a 4-dimensional rotation group
around a point (ν, . . . , ν) together with a translation of ν. Furthermore, ζ a and
ζ b are contrasts, that is, linear combinations with coefﬁcients adding to 0. The
space of such contrasts is a 3-dimensional subspace of the original 4-dimensional
space, and by a single orthogonal transformation, the relevant subset of the 4-
dimensional rotations can be transformed into the group G of 3-dimensional
rotations on this latter space, and the translation in ν is irrelevant. One such
orthogonal transformation is given by
ψ0 = 1
2(μa + μb + μc + μd),
ψ1 = 1
2(−μa −μb + μc + μd),
ψ2 = 1
2(−μa + μb −μc + μd),
ψ3 = 1
2(−μa + μb + μc −μd).
Let G be the group of rotations orthogonal to ψ0. We ﬁnd
ζ a = −2
3(ψ1 + ψ2 + ψ3),
ζ b = −2
3(ψ1 −ψ2 −ψ3).
The group G of rotations of contrasts is isomorphic to the group of rotations
of coefﬁcients. So, instead of considering the group element gab transforming ζ a

5.6
The Born Formula
139
into ζ b, it is equivalent to look at the rotation group element transforming the unit
vector a = −1
√
3(1, 1, 1) into the unit vector b = −1
√
3(1, −1, −1). The group K
of rotating unit vectors was discussed in Chap.4 in connection to the spin/angular
momentum example. For the spin 1/2 case, it was indicated in Sect. 4.4.7 that the
group K, for the purpose of permissibility of the spin components, may be replaced
by the subgroup H c of rotations around the ﬁxed vector c together with a reﬂection
around c. This group is transitive on the discretized spin 1/2 components, and can
also be used for our purpose here: Taking c to point along the midline between a
and b, a 180◦rotation transforms a into b.
In conclusion, the whole situation can be seen as equivalent to the spin 1/2
example of and satisﬁes the assumptions of this example as discussed in Chap. 4.
Making the rationality Assumption 2 then implies from Proposition 5.2:
π = P(sign(ζ b) = +1|sign(ζ a) = +1) = 1
2(1 + a · b) = 1
3.
Going through the derivations in Chap. 4, I would claim that in this example,
the assumptions made there are satisﬁed. The actor doing the experiment has
two maximally accessible conceptual variables in his mind at the same time: θa
connected to the previous experiment and θb connected to the new experiment. Thus
by Theorem 4.3 a relevant Hilbert space can be constructed, and unique operators
Aa and Ab connected to these variables may be deﬁned. By Theorem 4.4 we may
assume that the eigenvalues of these operators are ±1, and by Theorem 4.5 that the
two eigenspaces of each of them are one-dimensional. Hence we can take H to
be two-dimensional. By the important Proposition 4.1, each question “What is the
value of θ?” together with the answer −1 or +1, is associated with one eigenvector.
It remains to discuss whether or not the rationality Assumption 2 can be assumed
to hold in this situation. If the actors behind the both experiments take care and
follow as well as they can the usual rules in designing their experiments, I would
say that this assumption is reasonable.
I guess that many statisticians will prefer the Bayesian calculations here for the
quantum theory calculation. But the prior chosen in this example must be considered
somewhat arbitrary, and its “objective” limit may lead to conceptual difﬁculties.
Since experiments of this kind can in principle be done in practice—at least
approximately, the question whether the Bayesian solution or the quantum solution
holds in such cases may perhaps ultimately be seen as an empirical question. But I
consider the arguments behind the quantum theory solution here to be strong.
5.6.5
Superselection Rules
Two states |ψ⟩and |θ⟩obey a superselection rule if ⟨ψ|A|θ⟩= 0 for all operators
A representing e-variables. This can be the case for instance if the Hilbert space
decomposes as H = H1 ⊕H2, |ψ⟩∈H1, |θ⟩∈H2 and all e-variables act either

140
5
Aspects of Quantum Theory
on H1 or H2. In this case the linear combinations |η⟩= α|ψ⟩+ β|θ⟩have no
physical meaning by the following argument:
⟨η|A|η⟩= trace(ρA)
for all A, where ρ = |α|2|ψ⟩⟨ψ|+|β|2|θ⟩⟨θ|, so the artiﬁcial superposition might as
well be replaced by a density matrix, and thus any quantum probability in the given
state may be replaced by a classical probability between the two parts. A thorough
discussion of superselection rules can be found in Giulini (2009).
5.7
Measurements and Quantum Statistical Inference
5.7.1
Collapse of the Wave Packet
In this subsection and the next one, I will look at perfect measurements, both since
this is commonly discussed in the quantum mechanical literature, and since it forms
the basis for further discussions of non-perfect measurements.
Related to the measurement is the phenomenon of collapse of the wave packet.
Assume ﬁrst an initial state |a; k⟩, and then a perfect measurement giving the value
θb = ub
j. After the measurement the state then changes to |b; j⟩. This discontinuous
change of the state has been considered a great problem in the very common general
ontological view on quantum mechanics, problems so great that some physicists
adhere to a many-worlds interpretation (see Everett 1973) to cope with it. In a very
concrete sense, in our epistemic interpretation the collapse represents no problem.
A similar “collapse” occurs in Bayesian statistics once an observation is made.
However, note the alternative to collapse given by Zwirn’s Convivial Solipsism,
discussed in Chap. 4. In this section, I will take a more conventional view and regard
the collapse as a phenomenon to be explicitly considered.
The situation is similar, but more complicated when a real measurement is made.
To cope with this, (Barndorff-Nielsen et al., 2003) introduced the general notion
of an instrument. A simple instrument corresponding to perfect measurements is
one where the state is transformed by projecting onto orthogonal subspaces of the
Hilbert space, together spanning the whole space. This is also called the Lüders–
von Neumann projection postulate. It is indicated in op. cit. that more general
instruments can be formed by combining this with Schrödinger evaluation (see
Sect. 5.10 here) and by forming compound systems.
For completeness I will give a brief description of the Lüders–von Neumann
projection postulate, following Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2003). Let us measure a
variable connected to a self-adjoint operator A. Let {u1, . . . , ud} be its distinct
eigenvalues. Let (u) denote the matrix which projects onto the eigenspace
corresponding to the eigenvalue u, not necessarily one-dimensional. Thus A =

u u(u). Deﬁne an projection valued measure by M({u}) = (u), and also

5.7
Measurements and Quantum Statistical Inference
141
what is called an instrument by n(u) = (u). When this instrument is applied
to a quantum state given by the density matrix ρ = 
k πk|k⟩⟨k|, we obtain the
outcome u with probability trace(ρ(u)) = 
k πk∥(u)|k⟩∥2. We may compute
that the ﬁnal state is the mixture, given that the initial pure state was |k⟩and given
that the measurement outcome was u, a mixture of the pure states with state vectors
equal to the normalized projections
(u)|k⟩/∥(u)|k⟩∥.
The probabilistic interpretation is that with probability πk the quantum system
started in the pure state with state vector |k⟩. On measuring the observable A,
the state vector is projected into one of its eigenspaces, with probabilities equal
to the square lengths of the projections. We observe the corresponding eigenvalue.
Explicitly, this gives the state with density matrix
(u)ρ(u)
trace(ρ(u)).
5.7.2
Perfect Observations as Seen by a Single Observer
In Chap. 4 the quantum state was connected to a focused question together with a
deﬁnite answer to that question. The different questions were labeled by an index
a. The corresponding e-variable θa was connected to an operator Aa on the Hilbert
space of the physical system. Typically, two such operators Aa and Ab will be non-
commuting. This means that no single observer can observe both θa and θb at the
same time.
So ﬁx one observer, let θ be a simple e-variable observed by this observer, and
let A be the operator connected to θ. By the spectral theorem or by the discussion
in Sect. 4.5 we can write A = 
k ukk, where the uk’s are different and the
orthogonal projectors {k} satisfy

Let the projector k project upon a vector space Vk. Then (5.12) means that the
orthogonal vector spaces Vk span the whole Hilbert space. The statement |ψ⟩∈
Vk means that |ψ⟩is an eigenvector of A corresponding to the eigenvalue uk. The
interpretation of this as seen by a single observer, is: He has posed a question to the
system “What is the value of θ?” and has obtained a deﬁnite answer “θ = uk.”
For the case of a non-generate eigenvalue uk with eigenvector |k⟩, we have k =
|k⟩⟨k|. In general (5.12) is called a projective decomposition of the identity (PDI).

Aspects of Quantum Theory
If the state of the system is given by a density matrix ρ, then by the Born rule
pk = P(θ = uk) = trace(ρk).
(5.13)
The projectors k have eigenvalues 0 and 1, and in this way they resemble
indicator functions. In fact, a PDI divides the Hilbert space into mutually exclusive
subspaces. By combining these subspaces, we get a Boolean algebra (σ-algebra in
statistical terms), and probabilities may be assigned to this algebra. For instance,
j + k is a projector, and P(j OR k) = P(θ = uj or uk) = trace(ρ(j +
k)), and similarly for 3 or more distinct projectors.
Two PDIs {k} and {k} are called compatible if jk = kj for every j and
k. Then we have a reﬁned Boolean algebra with elements jk for all combina-
tions. If B = 
k vkk is connected to an e-variable γ , then P(j AND k) =
P(θ = uj or γ = vk) = trace(ρ(jk)). In this way a complete probability
calculus for perfect observations may be found. In the literature on consistent
histories, see for instance (Grifﬁths, 2017b), it is important that P(j AND k)
only is meaningful when {k} and {k} are compatible. But in a more general
theory, this can be given a meaning in terms of successive measurements; see (5.11).
For a continuous e-variable, like the position ξ of a particle, discussed in
Sect. 5.3, a more general construction of the projectors and the corresponding
vector spaces must be applied. As mentioned there, the spectral measure E for
the operator A for the position ξ is given as follows: For an interval I, E(I)
is given by multiplying with the indicator function for the interval. In general
P(ξ ∈B) = trace(ρE(B)).
5.7.3
Simple Real Measurements
It is an important task now to depart from the assumption of perfect measurements,
and address measurements with real data z. I start by discussing the simplest
measurements. I ﬁrst introduce the concept of operator valued measure.
Assume a likelihood p(zb|θb = ub
j) for the e-variable θb, and assume ﬁrst for
simplicity that the operator corresponding to θb has non-degenerate eigenvalues ub
j.
Deﬁne an operator valued measure M by M({zb}) = 
j p(zb|θb = ub
j)|b; j⟩⟨b; j|.
This is just the likelihood effect corresponding to the observation zb. The context τ
and the values ub
j of θb are assumed ﬁxed. The operator valued measure for a set C
in the sample space is deﬁned by M(C) = 
z∈C M({z}).
These operators, called POVM (positive-operator valued measures) in the liter-
ature, satisfy M(S) = I for the whole sample space and are countably additive.
Let the current state be given by the question: “What is the value of θa?”, and
then the probabilities πa(ua
k) for the different values θa = ua
k. Then, deﬁning
ρ = 
k πa(ua
k)|a; k⟩⟨a; k| we get P(C) = trace(ρM(C)) for all sets C in the
sample space. This is again proved by a straightforward argument from Born’s

5.7
Measurements and Quantum Statistical Inference
143
formula. An independent proof of the same formula in a more general setting is
given by Holevo (1982) Proposition 1.6.1.
This gives a statistical model. In Sect. 5.11 below I give a discussion on how this
model can be used to estimate ρ when this is completely unknown. This is however
not the usual physical situation. Ordinarily the initial state |a; k⟩is known through
our preparation of the system, and we ask a new question: What is the value of θb?
The statistical approach to this problem is ﬁrst to model the response of the
measurement apparatus as a function of θb. An example of this approach is given in
Sect. 1.5.5, the Stern–Gerlach experiment. In general, statistical theory can be used
to estimate θb from the experiment, see Lehmann and Casella (1998). Bayesian
estimation can be used, since we have a prior from Born’s formula.
Since θb is discrete, and the experiment is often very accurate, we may get a very
accurate estimate, nearly the real value. In fact, standard quantum mechanical texts
often assume that the real value of θb is obtained in such measurements.
One approach to the quantum theory of measurement is to assume a joint
entangled quantum model for the object systems and the apparatus. As discussed in
detail by Busch et al. (1991), this may lead to logical difﬁculties if the apparatus also
is assumed to be a quantum system, a point of view which assumes an ontological
interpretation of the wave function. These difﬁculties have been attempted solved
by many authors in many different ways. One approach is the consistent history
approach, see Grifﬁths (2014, 2017a). In Grifﬁths (2017a) this approach is used to
solve several apparent paradoxes of quantum theory, among others one involving a
Mach–Zehnder interferometer. From an epistemic point of view, this is an example
of a general situation where an observer may deﬁne θ1 =path chosen by a particle
and θ2 =phase of the source, and where the vector (θ1, θ2) is inaccessible for all
observers. Here θ1 and θ2 are two maximally accessible conceptual variables; the
Hilbert space and the corresponding operators may be found as in Theorem 4.3. By
the developments in Chap. 4 there are no logical difﬁculties here when everything is
seen from an epistemic point of view.
5.7.4
Quantum Statistical Inference
In some applications, the density matrix ρ depends upon an unknown parameter
η. Then the probability measure P above also depends upon η, and we obtain a
statistical model. This is the point of departure of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2003),
where many notions of ordinary statistical inference theory are generalized. It is also
the point of departure of Chap.6 in Holevo (1982).
The probability model for the experiment will be given by
P η(C) = trace(ρηM(C)),
(5.14)
where M is a POVM.

144

Aspects of Quantum Theory
In the spirit of this book it is important to look upon the sets C as sets in the data
space. So (5.14) describes an ordinary statistical model, and all statistical theory
applies.
In particular, we can consider symmetries in the data space and corresponding
symmetries in the e-variable space; see Sect. 2.2 and also Helland (2004). If a group
G∗is deﬁned on the data space, the corresponding group G on the e-variable space
is determined by
P gη(z ∈C) = P η(z ∈g∗C) g ∈G, g∗∈G∗.
(5.15)
The two groups are homomorphic.
In the present setting, one can talk about covariant measurements. In analogy
with Holevo (1982), Chap. 4, consider the following: Let g∗→U(g∗) be a
projective unitary representation of G∗on a Hilbert space H ; see the end of
Appendix B. The measurement M is called covariant if
U(g∗)†M(C)U(g∗) = M(Cg∗−1),
g∗∈G∗,
(5.16)
for any C, where Cg∗= {z : z = g∗z′, z′ ∈C} is the image of the set C under the
transformation g∗. This gives rise to an interesting theory.
There is a large literature on quantum statistical inference. The ﬁeld started with
the monographs of Helstrom (1976) and Holevo (1982), the latter continued in
Holevo (2001). There is much more material in Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2003)
and also in Holevo (1982, 2001). Hayashi (2005) is a collection of papers on the
asymptotic theory of quantum statistical inference. A number of recent papers on
quantum statistics can be found in Gill et al. (2014).
5.8
Entanglement, EPR, and the Bell Theorem
The total spin components in different directions for a system of two spin 1/2
particles are valid accessible conceptual variables, and so is the norm of this total
spin vector. Assume that we have such a system where j = 0, that is, the state is
such that the total spin is zero. By ordinary quantum mechanical calculations, this
state can be explicitly written as
|ψ1⟩=
1
√
2
(|1, +⟩⊗|2, −⟩−|1, −⟩⊗|2, +⟩),
(5.17)
where |1, +⟩⊗|2, −⟩is a state where particle 1 has a spin component +1/2 and
particle 2 has a spin component −1/2 along the z-axis, and vice versa for |1, −⟩⊗
|2, +⟩. This is what is called an entangled state, that is, a state which is not a direct
product of the component state vectors. I will follow my own program, however,
and stick to the e-variable description.

5.8
Entanglement, EPR, and the Bell Theorem
145
Assume further that the two particles separate, the spin component of particle
1 is measured in some direction by an observer Alice (say θa when the direction
is a), and the spin component of particle 2 is measured by an observer Bob (ηb in
direction b). First look at the case where the two observers both agree to measure
spin in some ﬁxed direction a, both measurements assumed for simplicity to be
perfect. As a ﬁnal assumption, let the positions of the two observers at the time of
measurement be spacelike, that is, the distance between them is so large that no
signal can reach from one to the other at this time, taking into account that signals
cannot go faster than the speed of light by the theory of relativity.
This is Bohm’s version of the situation behind the argument against the com-
pleteness of quantum mechanics as posed by Einstein et al. (1935) and countered by
Bohr (1935a,b). This discussion is still vigorous in the quantum literature today,
although most physicists now support Bohr on the question of completeness of
quantum mechanics. Bohm’s version is the EPR experiment as treated in Sect. 4.3.6,
where the discussion is based on Hervé Zwirn’s Convivial Solipsism.
Let us then look at the more complicated situation where the measurement
settings are not the same, more speciﬁcally, where Alice tosses a coin and measures
in the direction a if head and a′ if tail, while Bob tosses an independent coin and
measures in some direction b if head and in another direction b′ if tail. Then there
is an algebraic inequality
θaηb + θa′ηb + θaηb′ −θa′ηb′ ≤2.
(5.18)
Since all the conceptual variables take values ±1, this inequality follows from
(θa + θa′)ηb + (θa −θa′)ηb′ = ±2 ≤2.
Now replace the e-variables here with actual measurements. Taking then formal
expectations from (5.18), assume that the products here have meaning as random
variables; in the physical literature this is stated as an assumption of realism and
locality. This leads formally to
E(
θa 
ηb) + E(
θa′ 
ηb) + E(
θa
ηb′) −E(
θa′ 
ηb′) ≤2.
(5.19)
This is one of Bell’s inequalities, called the CHSH inequality.
On the other hand, using quantum mechanical calculations, that is Born’s
formula, from the basic state (5.17), shows that a, a′, b, and b′ can be chosen
such that Bell’s inequality (5.19) is violated. This is also conﬁrmed by numerous
experiments with electrons and photons.
The ﬁrst experiments showing a violation of the inequality in real situations were
performed by Aspect, but these experiments were criticized, and various authors
proposed different “loopholes” for such experiments. In 2015 three different groups
reported “loophole-free” experiments, and in all these experiments Bell’s inequality
was violated. For references and further discussion, see Khrennikov (2016b).

Aspects of Quantum Theory
There is a huge literature on Bell’s inequality, and I will not try to survey anything
of this. Instead I will give my own explanations, partly inspired by Hervé Zwirn’s
Convivial Solipsism.
So let us assume that Alice and Bob do a number n of independent joint
measurements as described above. Let Xi be the response measured by Alice in
measurement number i, and let Yi be the corresponding response measured by Bob,
all these variables taking the values ±1, (i = 1, . . . , n). These numbers, together
with the settings, a or a′, respectively b or b′ are recorded by the two actors. This
forms two data sets, one belonging to Alice and one belonging to Bob.
For later analysis of these data sets, one can appeal to the conditionality principle
(see Chap.3). Whoever should analyze the data, should for each measurement
obtained condition on the chosen setting. Thus Alice has two data sets, those with
setting a, where the response is called A, and those with setting a′, where the
response is called A′. Similarly, Bob has two data sets, one with setting b, where
the response is called B, and those with setting b′, where the response is called B′.
Now recall the hold-on principle of Zwirn’s Convivial Solipsism. Whatever
happens later, Alice will hold on to her measurements as a partial context for
future decisions. In making these measurements, she has all the time been focusing
on her own conceptual variables θa and θa′. Similarly, Bob will hold on to his
measurements of ηb and ηb′.
Now let us assume that Alice has recorded all her data, and handed them over to
a statistician Charlie, and, similarly that Bob has handed his data over to Charlie.
Let us further assume that Charlie knows the physical situation, which means that
his state in this physical context can be described by the state function ψ1 in (5.17).
What does that mean in terms of Charlie’s conceptual variables? The bases of his
Hilbert space must be given by the 4 ket vectors |1, ±⟩⊗|2, ±⟩, or, equivalently by
the 4 vectors |ψ1⟩and
|ψ2⟩=
1
√
2
(|1, +⟩⊗|2, −⟩+ |1, −⟩⊗|2, +⟩),
(5.20)
|ψ3⟩=
1
√
2
(|1, +⟩⊗|2, +⟩+ |1, −⟩⊗|2, −⟩),
(5.21)
|ψ4⟩=
1
√
2
(|1, +⟩⊗|2, +⟩−|1, −⟩⊗|2, −⟩).
(5.22)
Now take one of Charie’s conceptual variables to be δ = θxηx +θyηy +θzηz, the
dot product of the two spin vectors. The operator corresponding to this conceptual
variable can be found (for a detailed calculation, see the exercises in Chap. 6 of
Susskind and Friedman (2014), in particular Exercise 6.9), and it turns out that all
|ψj⟩are eigenvectors of this operator, |ψ1⟩with the eigenvalue −3 and |ψ2⟩, |ψ3⟩,
and |ψ4⟩with the eigenvalue +1.
So Charlie is in the state given by δ = −3. But this is only possible if
θxηx = θyηy = θzηz = −1, which implies that θcηc = −1 for any direction

5.9
The Free will Theorem
147
c, implying that, for Charlie, θc = −ηc always. For Charlie, quantum mechanics is
a valid theory, and he may from his assumptions use Born’s formula to calculate the
expectations E(AB), E(A′B), E(AB′), and E(A′B′), and conclude that E(AB) +
E(A′B) + E(AB′) −E(A′B′) might be larger than 2, in conﬂict with the formal
inequality (5.19).
He might then use the data handed over by Alice and Bob, estimate the above
expectations, and not be surprised that this supports his conclusions.
Later, Charlie and Alice may talk together, and they might disagree about this
conclusion. Alice will stick to what she has learned through her own data. For her,
she only knows that Bob’s measurements of ηb and ηb′ took the values ±1. So for
her, the inequality (5.18) might hold for the measured values, so she might conclude
that (5.19) also should be valid.
Alice might well be very intelligent. Her total Hilbert space may for instance be
of the form H ⊗K , where H is given by her conceptual variables connected
to the Bell experiment situation and her experiences there, and K is connected to
other situations. Nevertheless she will insist on holding on to her own experiences
as her basis for her world view. This will always form part of her context for making
new decisions.
In the same way, we all are stuck with our own experiences when making new
decisions or actions, whether or not these are formed by subjective focusing or not,
and perhaps also in discussions with other, more knowledgable human beings. Some
will perhaps say that this is drawing the conclusions from the Bell experiments too
far, but this is the way I see it.
I hope to say more about the Bell experiment issue elsewhere.
Entanglement is very important in modern applications of quantum mechanics,
not least in quantum information theory, including quantum computation. It is also
an important ingredient in the theory of decoherence; see Schlosshauer (2007),
which explains why ordinary quantum effects are not usually visible on a larger
scale. Decoherence theory shows the importance of the entanglement of each system
with its environment. In particular, it leads in effect to the conclusion that all
observers share common observations after decoherence between the system and
its environment, and this can then be identiﬁed with the “objective” aspects of
the world, which is also what the superior actor D of Sect. 5.5 would ﬁnd in this
situation.
5.9
The Free will Theorem
Throughout the times, several authors have proposed various types of hidden
variable theories which they claim to be consistent with quantum mechanics.
Again and again the scopes of these theories have been limited by so-called no-
go-theorems. One of the ﬁrst and most well known of these theorems was that
of Kochen and Specker (1967): If a theory should be compatible with quantum

148
5
Aspects of Quantum Theory
mechanics, one cannot ﬁnd an arbitrary set of hidden variables that are non-
contextual and take deﬁnite values at any time.
One of the newest no-go-theorem is The Free Will Theorem of Conway and
Kochen (2006, 2008). They take as a point of departure the EPR-type experiment
with spin 1 particles, but presumably this can be generalized. They state two
assumptions that are weaker than, but implied by quantum mechanics and one
assumption which is implied by relativity theory. Under these assumptions they
prove:
The Free Will Theorem
If the choice of directions in which to perform spin 1 experiments is not a function of
the information accessible to the experimenters, then the responses of the particles
are equally not functions of the information accessible to them.
Thus the particles in a sense have a free will: Their responses are not in any way
determined by past history. Past history is here a very wide concept. It can include
stochastic variables given in advance, so this kind of simple randomness will not
help.
The speciﬁc assumptions that Conway and Kochen give for their free will
theorem are:
(1) SPIN
Measurements of Alice and Bob are both given in some frame (x, y, z), and
the measurements are always 1, 0,1 in some order. This is in particular satisﬁed
by the squares of the spin 1 components along the coordinate axes according to
quantum mechanics, which are commuting operators.
(2) TWIN
If the measurements performed by Alice and Bob are along the same axis,
they give the same result. This is analogous to what we assumed in the Bell
experiment discussed above, only that the signs of Bob’s measurements are
reversed.
(3) FIN
There is a ﬁnite upper bound to the speed with which information can be
effectively transmitted. This assumption is weakened in Conway and Kochen
(2008).
Admittedly, especially the SPIN-assumption describes a rather special situation,
but one can assume that the theorem can be generalized to other situations with
entanglement, in the language of the present book: To other situations where Alice
and Bob choose their measurement freely, but in different contexts. The result of the
Free Will Theorem is then that Nature also chooses its response freely: It is not in
any way a function of the past history of the universe. My conjecture is that there is
a free will type theorem whenever the physical system observed is complex enough.
What is then meant by a free choice? I adhere to the deﬁnition in a short note by
Colbeck and Renner (2013): A choice A is free if A is uncorrelated with the set of
all events W such that A does not cause W. In the Bell experiment, the choice A

5.10
The Schrödinger Equation
149
made by Alice should be uncorrelated with the past together with anything related
to Bob and his observations.
Bob is here any observer which cannot communicate with Alice. If two observers
communicate, their free choice is restricted. Then each of them forms part of the
context experienced by the other person.
5.10
The Schrödinger Equation
During a time when no measurement is done on the system, the ket vector is known
in quantum mechanics to develop according to the Schrödinger equation:
i ¯h d
dt |ψ⟩t = H|ψ⟩t,
(5.23)
where H is a self-adjoint operator called the Hamiltonian (the total energy operator).
I will give two sets of arguments for the Schrödinger equation, one rough and
general, and then one speciﬁc related to position. The last argument also includes a
discussion of the wave function.
5.10.1
The General Argument: Unitary Transformations
and Entanglement
Assume that the system at time 0 has a state given by the ket |ψ⟩0 and at time
t by the ket |ψ⟩t. Let us assume that the contexts are given as follows: We can
ask an epistemic question about a maximally accessible variable θ, and the ket
corresponding to a speciﬁc value of this variable is |θ⟩0 at time 0 and |θ⟩t at time t.
We have the choice between making an perfect measurement at time 0 or at time t.
Since there is no disturbance through measurement of the system between these two
time points, the probability distribution of the answer must be the same whatever
choice is made. Hence according to Born’s formula
|0⟨θ|ψ⟩0|2 = |t⟨θ|ψ⟩t|2.
(5.24)
Now we refer to a general theorem by Wigner (1959), proved in detail by
Bargmann (1964): If an equation like (5.24) holds, then there must be a unitary or
antiunitary transformation from |ψ⟩0 to |ψ⟩t. (Antiunitary U means U−1 = −U†.)
Since by continuity an antiunitary transformation can be excluded here, so we have
|ψ⟩t = Ut|ψ⟩0

150
5
Aspects of Quantum Theory
for some unitary operator Ut. Writing Ut = exp( At
i ¯h ) for some self-adjoint operator
At, and assuming that At is linear in t: At = Ht, this is equivalent to (5.23). In fact,
assuming that {Ut} forms a strongly continuous group of unitary transformations,
the form Ht of At follows from a theorem by Stone; see Holevo (2001).
Unitary transformations of states play an important role in quantum mechanics.
Both in the continuous case and in the discrete case such a transformation can
be used to illuminate the state concept as introduced in the present book. More
speciﬁcally, a unitary change of an operator can quite generally be coupled to a
concrete change of the involved conceptual variable; see Theorem 4.2 of Sect. 4.4.4.
When an operator is changed in this way, its eigenvectors are changed accordingly,
hence there is a change of states. Note that, subject to linearity, a unitary operator U
always can be written as U = exp( Ht
i ¯h ) for some suitable Hamiltonian H, so these
transformations can be seen as closely related to time developments of states.
Consider the discrete case. Let the initial state be |a; k⟩⊗|b; j⟩, corresponding
to the answers of two focused questions: θa = ua
k and γ b = vb
j . By a unitary
transformation, essentially by a time development, this initial state is transformed
into a state which cannot be written as a product of states in this way, but is a linear
combination of such states. This is an entangled state. Thus in my terminology,
entangled states can at least in some cases be given concrete interpretations: Some
ﬁxed time ago they were given as answers to two focused questions. By the inverse
unitary transformation, the entangled state may be transformed back to the state
|a; k⟩⊗|b; j⟩again. Thus we have then a concrete interpretation of the entangled
state: Subject to a suitable Hamiltonian, the state can be interpreted as the answer to
two focused questions posed at some past time.
5.10.2
Position As An Inaccessible Stochastic Process
As in Sect. 5.3 consider the motion of a non-relativistic one-dimensional particle,
but now make time explicit. Since momentum and hence velocity cannot be deter-
mined simultaneously with position with arbitrary accuracy, it is also impossible to
determine positions ξ(s) and ξ(t) simultaneously for two different time points s and
t with arbitrary accuracy. Hence the vector (ξ(s), ξ(t)) is inaccessible. Fix a time
point t. Different observers may focus on different aspects from the past of the time
t in order to try to predict ξ(t) as well as possible. These aspects may be formulated
by propositional logic in different ways, but for reasons discussed in Appendix E. I
will in this book concentrate on a probabilistic description. Thus observer Bi may
predict ξ(t) by conditioning on some σ-algebra Pi of information from the past.
This may be information from some speciﬁc time point si with si < t, but it can
also take other forms. We must think of these different observers as hypothetical.
Nevertheless one can imagine that all possible information, subject to the choice of
observer later, is collected in an inaccessible σ-algebra Pt, the past of ξ(t). The
distribution of ξ(t), given the past Pt, for each t, can then be represented as a
stochastic process.

5.10
The Schrödinger Equation
151
In the simplest case one can then imagine {ξ(s); s ≥0} as an inaccessible
Markov process: The future is independent of the past, given the present. Under
suitable regularity conditions, a continuous Markov process will be a diffusion
process, i.e., a solution of a stochastic differential equation of the type
dξ(t) = b(ξ(t), t)dt + σ(ξ(t), t)dw(t).
(5.25)
Here b(·, ·) and σ(·, ·) are continuous functions, also assumed differentiable, and
{w(t); t ≥0} is a Wiener process. The Wiener process is a stochastic process
with continuous paths, independent increments w(t) −w(s), w(0) = 0 and
E((w(t) −w(s))2) = t −s. Many properties of the Wiener process have been
studied, including the fact that its paths are nowhere differentiable. The stochastic
differential equation (5.25) must therefore be deﬁned in a particular way; for an
introduction to Itô calculus or Stochastic calculus; see for instance Klebaner (1998).
One well known result is Itô’s formula: For a two times continuously differentiable
function f one has:
df (ξ(t), t) = ft(ξ(t), t)dt + fx(ξ(t), t)dξ(t) + 1
2fxx(ξ(t), t)σ 2(ξ(t), t)dt.
(5.26)
Here and in the following, subscripts denote partial derivatives.
There is also the Fokker–Planck equation for the probability density ρ(x, t) of
ξ(t):
ρt(x, t) = −(b(x, t)ρ(x, t))x + 1
2(σ 2(x, t)ρ(x, t))xx.
So far we have considered observers making predictions of the present value
ξ(t), given the past Pt. There is another type of epistemic processes which can be
described as follows: Imagine an actor Bj which considers some future event for
the particle, lying in a σ-algebra Fj. He asks himself in which position he should
place the particle at time t as well as possible in order to have this event fulﬁlled.
In other words, he can adjust ξ(t) for this purpose. Again one can collect the σ-
algebras for the different potential actors in one big inaccessible σ-algebra Ft, the
future after t. The conditioning of the present, given the future, deﬁnes {ξ(t); t ≥0}
as a new inaccessible stochastic process, with now t running backwards in time.
In the simplest case this is a Markov process, and can be described by a stochastic
differential equation
dξ(t) = b∗(ξ(t), t)dt + σ∗(ξ(t), t)dw∗(t),
(5.27)
where again w∗(t) is a Wiener process.

152
5
Aspects of Quantum Theory
Since t is now running backwards in time, Itô’s formula now reads:
df (ξ(t), t) = ft(ξ(t), t)dt + fx(ξ(t), t)dξ(t) −1
2fxx(ξ(t), t)σ 2
∗(ξ(t), t)dt.
(5.28)
The Fokker–Planck equation is now:
ρt(x, t) = −(b∗(x, t)ρ(x, t))x −1
2(σ 2
∗(x, t)ρ(x, t))xx.
5.10.3
Nelson’s Stochastic Mechanics
Without having much previous knowledge about modern stochastic analysis and
without knowing anything about epistemic processes. Nelson (1967) formulated his
stochastic mechanics, which serves our purpose perfectly. Nelson considered the
multidimensional case, but for simplicity, I will here only discuss a one-dimensional
particle. Everything can be generalized. The discussion here will be brief. I refer to
Nelson (1967) for details.
Nelson discussed what corresponds to the stochastic differential equations (5.25)
and (5.27) with σ and σ∗constant in space and time. Since heavy particles ﬂuctuate
less than light particles, he assumed that these quantities vary inversely with mass
m, that is, σ 2 = σ 2
∗= ¯h/m. The constant ¯h has dimension action, and turns out to
be equal to Planck’s constant divided by 2π. This assumes that σ 2 = σ 2
∗, a fact that
Nelson actually proved in addition to proving that
b∗= b −σ 2(lnρ)x.
Now deﬁne
u = 1
2(b −b∗),
v = 1
2(b + b∗).
Then
u = 1
2σ 2(lnρ)x,
and the two Fokker–Planck equations give the continuity equation
ρt = −(vρ)x.
By a simple manipulation from this, one ﬁnds that
ut = −1
2σ 2vxx −(vu)x.

The Schrödinger Equation

Related to (5.26) with (5.25) inserted and (5.28) with (5.27) inserted, Nelson
deﬁned the forward and backward derivatives
Df (x(t), t) = ft(x(t), t) + b(x(t), t)fx(x(t), t) + 1
2σ 2fxx(x(t), t);
D∗f (x(t), t) = ft(x(t), t) + b∗(x(t), t)fx(x(t), t) −1
2σ 2fxx(x(t), t),
and argued that the acceleration of the particle can be deﬁned by
a(t) = 1
2D∗Dx(t) + 1
2DD∗x(t).
Then a simple manipulation shows that Dξ(t) = b(ξ(t), t), D∗ξ(t) = b∗(ξ(t), t)
and that
vt = a + uux −vvx + 1
2σ 2uxx.
(5.30)
By Newton’s law, the force F upon the particle is ma. Assuming that F is derived
as the negative gradient of a potential V , we get a = −m−1Vx. Inserting this and at
the same time σ 2 = ¯h/m into (5.29) and (5.30), we have a coupled nonlinear set of
differential equations for u(x, t) and v(x, t). This can be solved as an initial value
problem assuming u(x, 0) = u0(x) and v(x, 0) = v0(x) for some given functions
u0 and v0.
From the relationship between b and b∗we already know that
Rx = m
¯h u,
where R(x, t) = 1
2lnρ(x, t). Let S be deﬁned up to an additive constant by
Sx = m
¯h v,
and deﬁne the complex function f (x, t) by
f = eR+iS.
Then |f (x, t)|2 = ρ(x, t). Nelson interpreted f as the wave function of the particle.
A remarkable fact, noted by Nelson, is that the nonlinear set of Eqs. (5.29)
and (5.30) for u and v transforms into a linear equation
ft = i ¯h
2mfxx −i 1
¯hVf + iα(t)f.
(5.31)

Aspects of Quantum Theory
To prove this, we compute the derivatives in (5.31) and divide by f , ﬁnding
Rt + iSt = i ¯h
2m(Rxx + iSxx + [Rx + iSx]2) −i 1
¯hV + iα(t).
Taking x-derivatives here and separating real and imaginary parts, we see that this
is equivalent to the pair of equations
ut = −¯h
2mvxx −(vu)x,
vt =
¯h
2muxx + 1
2(u2)x −1
2(v2)x −1
mVx.
This is the same as (5.29) and (5.30).
Finally, Nelson notes that since the integral of ρ is 1, hence independent of
t, if (5.31) holds at all then α(t) must be real. By choosing, for each t, the
arbitrary constant in S appropriately, we can arrange for α(t) to be 0. Thus (5.31) is
equivalent to
i ¯h ∂
∂t f (x, t) = [ 1
2m(−i ¯h ∂
∂x )2 + V (x)]f (x, t).
(5.32)
This is the Schrödinger equation (5.23) with the Hamiltonian corresponding to the
sum of kinetic and potential energy. Note that as in Sect. 5.3 the operator for the
momentum of the particle is −i ¯h ∂
∂x .

More on Quantum Measurements
Recall that in the discrete case the density matrix ρ can be deﬁned by a question
“What is the value of θ?” together with probabilities πk associated with the possible
answers uk as ρ =  πk|k⟩⟨k|. In Sect. 5.7 I addressed the measurement situation
where we have data z, and where the question variable was speciﬁed. Here we will
look at the situation where ρ is completely unknown; in particular, where there is
no previously speciﬁed question variable.
First note that if the dimension of the Hilbert space is m, then ρ depends upon
m2 −1 unknown real parameters. This is proved as follows: ρ is in general a self-
adjoint matrix of trace 1. This implies m real parameters on the diagonal and m(m−
1)/2 complex parameters above the diagonal which also determine the parameters
below the diagonal, giving a total of m + 2 · m(m −1)/2 = m2 parameter. From
this, 1 has to be subtracted because of the trace 1 condition.
Inference on ρ is done by asking new questions “What is θb?” for new known
values of b. For simplicity we assume that the e-variables θb are maximal, so
that the eigenvalues uj of the corresponding operators Ab are distinct. We now

5.11
More on Quantum Measurements
155
depart from the assumption that the experiment of measuring θb is perfect. We
assume real data zb, also taking the values uj j = 1, . . . , m. The error model
P b
ij = P(zb = uj|θb = ui) is assumed known from earlier experiments with the
same measurement apparatus.
Recall that there can be deﬁned a positive operator values measure by the point
measures
Mb(uj) =
m

i=1
P b
ij |b; i⟩⟨b; i|,
(5.33)
and that this leads to the following point probabilities in the state deﬁned by ρ:
P(zb = uj|ρ) = trace(ρMb(uj)).
(5.34)
Equation (5.34) gives a model which is linear in the elements of ρ, and linear
combinations of these elements can be estimated as follows:
Assume n independent copies of the system described by the density ρ, and
perform the measurement b on each of these systems. Assume that yj of these
measurements give zb = uj for j = 1, . . . , m. Then (y1, . . . , ym) is multinomial
(see Sect. 2.1.2) with parameters n and ηj = P(zb = uj|ρ). Only m−1 of the latter
parameters are independent, since the probabilities sum to 1. These probabilities can
be estimated by
ηj = yj
n , j = 1, . . . , m −1.
(5.35)
The covariance matrix of these estimators is given by the diagonal terms ηj(1 −
ηj)/n and the off-diagonal terms −ηiηj/n. These elements are unknown, but for
large n they can be estimated consistently by replacing ηj by ηj here.
It is interesting that a central limit theorem is valid for the multinomial
distribution. For large n, we have that √n(ηj −ηj) for j = 1, . . . , m −1 has
an approximate multinormal distribution with a covariance given by the diagonal
terms ηj(1 −ηj) and the off-diagonal terms −ηiηj. Thus for large n we can write
ηj = ηj + ej, where the joint covariance matrix of the small error terms ej is
approximately known. And the ej’s are approximately Gaussian.
By this procedure, we are able to estimate m −1 linear combinations of the
m2 −1 unknown elements of ρ. To ﬁnd estimates of all the elements, we must make
repeated measurements with different values of b, at least (m2−1)/(m−1) = m+1
values. Suppose that N = np independent copies of the system are available, where
p ≥m + 1, and make p independent experiments with values br r = 1, . . . , p.
From (5.34) this gives estimates of ηr
j = trace(ρMbr (uj)) for j = 1, . . . , m −1
and r = 1, . . . , p.

156

Aspects of Quantum Theory
Since Mbr(uj) from (5.33) are known operators, this can be written as follows:
Let ρ be the vector of the real parameters in ρ written in some order. Let η be the
vector of parameters ηr
j written in some order. Then we can ﬁnd a known matrix B
such that
η = Bρ.
The dimension of B is (m −1)p × (m2 −1). It has therefore at least as many rows
as columns. Since it contains the arbitrary constants P b
ij , and since the values of br
are different (different sets of orthogonal vectors {|b; j⟩}), it seems to be a relative
weak assumption to assume that it has rank m2 −1.
From this, it follows that
η = Bρ + e,
where the error vector e is approximately multinormal with an approximately
known covariance matrix . If  is assumed known, statistical theory for linear
models leads to the generalized least squares estimate, which also is the maximum
likelihood estimate:
ρ = (BT −1B)−1BT −1η.
This list of scalar estimates can be translated back to an estimate of the matrix
ρ. By construction, this ρ will be self-adjoint of trace 1, but a problem is that it can
happen that it is not positive, that is, ⟨ψ|ρ|ψ⟩may be negative for some choice of
the ket vector |ψ⟩. A similar problem may occur in statistics, in the estimation of
variance components. The problem becomes less if n is large.
A problem which has not been discussed up to now is the choice of the br’s.
Look at the minimal choice of p, p = m + 1. Intuitively, all the ket vectors |br; j⟩
j = 1, . . . , m −1; r = 1, . . ., m + 1 should be as orthogonal as possible. It is of
course impossible to have m2 −1 orthogonal vectors in an m-dimensional space,
but one should then relax on the assumption that the |br; j⟩for ﬁxed r and different
j should be exactly orthogonal.
A related problem has been discussed in the quantum mechanical literature
recently. A SIC POVM (symmetric informationally complete positive-operator
valued measure) is a set of m2 operators of the form Ei = (1/m)|i⟩⟨i|, where the
ket vectors |i⟩satisfy
|⟨i|j⟩|2 =
1
m + 1.
A SIC POVM has been constructed explicitly for a few valued of m. For many
more m, there is good numerical evidence that a SIC POVM exists. It has been
conjectured that it exists for all values of m, but no proof of this is available up
to now; see Wootters (2004) and references there. It is remarkable that Wootters

5.12

tries to connect the problem of determining an unknown density matrix and the SIC
POVM problem to a well known problem from experimental design, that of ﬁnding
the maximal number of orthogonal Latin squares of a given dimension.
One purpose of the discussion above has been to demonstrate that it may be
fruitful to use ideas from mathematical statistics to solve problems in quantum
mechanics.
5.12
More on QBism
QBism (quantum Bayesianism), and the technical foundation of QBism, has con-
tinued to develop since this interpretation of quantum mechanics ﬁrst was proposed
by Chris Fuchs. In this section, I will review some of this recent development, and
indicate how it is related to my own approach. A qualitative discussion of QBism
was given already in Chap. 1.
The basic foundation of QBism was again stressed in Fuchs et al. (2013). I
will limit myself to a few citations from that paper. First: ‘. . . QBism explicitly
takes the “subjective” or “judgmental” or “personalist” view of probability, which,
though common among contemporary statisticians and economists, is still rare
among physicists: probabilities are assigned to an event by an agent and are
particular to that agent.’ I agree with the last part of this statement: Probabilities
are assigned to an event by an agent. But agents communicate, and they may
share their probabilities by verbal communication. Thus these probabilities are
not only subjective results of bets. They may also be learned from others or
they may be the result of some symmetry considerations. Thus I allow for at
several different kinds of Bayesianism, in particular subjective Bayesianism and
objective Bayesianism from symmetries, the latter made concrete through group
actions deﬁned on conceptual variables. Finally, probabilities about events may
also directly result from experiments, from a statistical point of view experiments
interpreted in a frequentist way. Such probabilities arise from what (Schweder and
Hjort, 2002) call conﬁdence distributions, they are epistemic probabilities and do
not necessarily satisfy Kolmogorov’s axioms. Somewhat in contrast to what Fuchs
and collaborators say in the citation above, non-Bayesian views of probabilities are
also common among statisticians. Epistemic probabilities will be discussed in more
detail in Chap. 6. In conclusion: I allow for at least 3 interpretations of probabilities:
Subjective, based on symmetries and based on frequencies. This was also my point
of departure in Chap. 2.
Next it is important to explain how I differ from the QBists’ view on the
terms “knowledge” and “belief.” First, a short citation from Fuchs et al. (2013):
“That probability-1 (or probability-0) judgments are still judgments, like any other
probability assignments, may be the hardest principle of QBism for physicists to
understand.” Yes, they are the results of judgments, but I prefer to call these results
“knowledge” rather than “belief.” For me, the basic concept is that of decision, and
a decision may be taken on the basis of certain knowledge or on the basis of more

158

Aspects of Quantum Theory
uncertain belief. The QBists are not willing to use the word “knowledge” at all, as
documented by a longer citation from Fuchs et al. (2013):
“. . .any user’s own experience constitutes all the raw material out of which she
constructs the world.”
‘The subsequent view of Heisenberg and Rudolph Peierls, that quantum physics
was not about the world, but about our “knowledge” of the world, gets even closer
to the real issue. But this raises tough questions. Whose knowledge? Knowledge
about what? The trouble is that “knowledge” is the wrong term, for two reasons.’
‘First, it is wrong because generally there are many different agents. Anybody
using quantum mechanics to organize her experience can be an agent, and different
agents have different experiences. “Knowledge” can suggest an agent-independent
factuality. “Belief” which unavoidably implies a believer, is more balanced between
subject and object.’
‘Second, “knowledge” is the wrong word because the fundamental output of the
quantum theory is not a set of facts, but a set of probabilities. The probabilities in
quantum mechanics, like all probabilities, express the willingness of the agent using
them to take or place bets. The willingness is based on personal judgment, informed
by the agent’s beliefs.’
I strongly disagree with most of this. First: “Whose knowledge?” Of course the
knowledge of any agent or a set of communicating agents. Next: “The knowledge of
what?” In my view again this is obvious: The knowledge of the conceptual variables
deﬁned by this agent (these agents). This again shows the usefulness of the term
“conceptual variable.” Also, in my opinion, Fuchs and collaborators have a very
exclusive view on what they call an agent. “Anybody using quantum mechanics to
organize her experience” is a very severe limitation. I would rather say that anybody
able to ask a question “What is the value of θ?” for any conceptual variable θ deﬁned
by herself (or learned from somebody that she is communicating with), should
qualify as an agent. This agent may not have any knowledge [sic] of any aspect
of quantum theory, but after her experience she may be willing to assign probability
1 (or 0) to an event. This gives her knowledge. It may depend on personal judgment,
but it may also depend on experience with data. Or on what she has learned from
other people.
More technical papers are Fuchs and Schack (2011, 2013) and DeBrota et al.
(2020). The conceptual basis for these papers may be said to be Fig. 1 of Fuchs and
Schack (2011), where it is distinguished between a real measurement on the ground
with possible outcomes j = 1, . . . , m and a hypothetical, counterfactual experiment
“in the sky,” with outcomes i = 1, . . . , n. In a classical context the probability of the
real outcome j is denoted by s(j), the probability of the hypothetical outcome i is
denoted by p(i), and the probability of j, given i is r(j|i). This gives the connection
s(j) =
n

i=1
p(i)r(j|i).
(5.36)

5.12
More on QBism
159
This equation is nothing but a discretized version of an equation from ordinary
Bayesian inference, the law of total probability, if we imagine {i} to be the value
of the parameter and {j} to be the data. The statistical model is then given by r(j|i),
and p(i) are the prior probabilities, assumed Bayesians always to exist. By Bayes’
formula, the posterior is p(i)r(j|i)/s(j).
In a quantum mechanical setting, (Fuchs and Schack, 2011) tentatively propose
that (5.36) could be replaced by an equation of the form
q(j) =
n

i=1
f (p(i))r(j|i),
(5.37)
and for a special kind of “measurements in the sky” they present a series of
assumptions which make this to be equivalent to a variant of the Born formula.
To further explain the background for this, we need to introduce some concepts
and notations.
In the standard formulation of ﬁnite-dimensional quantum mechanics, a quantum
state is a density operator, ρ, on a d-dimensional Hilbert space. According to a
version of the Born rule, a measurement with n outcomes is described by a positive
operator valued measure (POVM), which can be seen in the countable case as a
collection {E1, . . . , En} of positive semi-deﬁnite operators that sum to identity.
Explicitly, the probability of the i-th hypothetical measurement is
p(i) = tr(ρEi).
(5.38)
A special case is when the POVM is informatically complete: Every linear
operator in the Hilbert space is a linear combination of the {Ei}. Then in particular
ρ = 
i αiEi. Given the POVM, it is easy to see Fuchs and Schack (2013) that there
in general is a one-to-one correspondence between {αi} and {p(i)}, so in this case,
ρ is uniquely determined by the set of probabilities {p(i)}.
A special case of this again is a symmetric informationally complete (SIC)
POVM deﬁned by Ei = 1
d Πi, where one assumes that there exist a very rich set
of projection operators Πi (i = 1, . . . , d2) such that
tr(ΠiΠj) = dδij + 1
d + 1 .
(5.39)
For many values of d, but not all, it is known that such a set of projection operators
exist.
For a SIC POVM the connection between {p(i)} and ρ can be given explicitly:
ρ =
d2

i=1
[(d + 1)p(i) −1
d ]Πi.
(5.40)

Aspects of Quantum Theory
By a number of assumptions, starting with the linearity of the function f , Fuchs
and Schack (2011) make this consistent with (5.37), (5.38), and the Born rule for
real measurements: q(j) = tr(ρFj), r(j|i) = tr(ΠiFj) for some POVM {Fj}. This
may be taken as the QBists’ assumptions behind the Born rule. I absolutely prefer
my own development of the Born rule in Sect. 5.6. As I see it, a weakness of the
above arguments is the following: For moderately large d there is a large number
d2 of unknown probabilities p(i). For a subjective Bayesian, each of these must be
imagined to be assessed by some subjective betting procedure, which may not be
trivial.
In Fuchs and Schack (2013) the argument for the Born rule via a SIC mea-
surement “in the sky” is extended and simpliﬁed, and the properties of the SIC
POVM’s are studied more closely. In DeBrota et al. (2020) the point of departure is
the following: A POVM {Ei} is said to be informationally complete if the operators
{Ei} span the space of self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space of some dimension
d, and an informationally complete POVM is said to be Minimal Informational
Complete (MIC) if it contains exactly d2 elements. It is shown that the SICs in
many ways are optimal among the MICs. The properties of MICs and SICs are
studied in some detail, and it is argued that informational completeness provides the
right perspective from which to compare the quantum and the classical. This paper
must be said to represent the current status of the more technical side of the QBist
program. This technical discussion is of course valid, but, as said above, I disagree
with the basic premises behind the discussion.
5.13
Discussion
So far, this book falls naturally into two parts, Chaps. 2 and 3 on conventional
inference, and the last chapters on quantum mechanics, although the two parts are
tied together. Let us ﬁrst discuss some of the results of the ﬁrst part.
As indicated in Sect. 3.4, statistical inference is often made in steps. At each
step, the results of the previous steps then form a part of the context. And it may
initiate more steps. A typical case is when a least squares estimation is done in
multiple regression, and this is followed by a residual analysis. Such a sequence is
not consistent with the ordinary likelihood principle, but it is consistent with my
extended basis, where I at each step condition on the relevant context.
It is often stated that a weakness with the deﬁnitions of sufﬁciency and ancillarity
is that they are strongly model dependent. This can remedied by a stepwise analysis,
where new models are tested in steps, following a residual analysis from older
models.
Taking more steps in the total inference, our basis is even consistent with
algorithmic procedures like Breiman’s trees (see Breiman 2001, and references
there) and the partial least squares algorithm see Martens and Næs (1989).

5.13
Discussion
161
All this must be taken under one proviso, however: The overall goal of the
statistical analysis must be formulated ﬁrst, and taken as part of the context for
all the steps.
I have not gone much into formal logic in this book. In Sect. 3.1 I indicated
an equivalence between propositional logic and the ordinary basis for probability
models. When I now discuss inference in steps, the propositional logic must be
extended to temporal logic, for which there is a large literature; see an introduction
in Venema (2001). A further extension would be to proceed to ﬁrst order and higher
order logic, but this is beyond the scope of the present book.
As a transition between the two parts of this book, the following remark was
made: Statistical literature has much discussion about the way to do inference, but
very little on the choice of what to do inference about. These different questions may
be conﬂicting, even complementary. The maximal symmetrical epistemic setting is
a way to formalize a situation where only one out of many possible questions may
be addressed.
The correspondence between indicators I(θa = uk) and certain ket vectors
|a; k⟩under some conditions (Proposition 4.1 etc.) is an important message of this
book. As shown in (5.3), this also implies important instances of the superposition
principle.
Here are some problems that at the present time must be considered as open:
– In a situation with several maximally accessible variables {θa : a ∈A }, when is
the mapping I(θa = uk) →|a; k⟩(Proposition 4.1) invertible?
– What about a discussion of open systems? These are thoroughly discussed from
a quantum statistical point of view by Holevo (2001).
– Can this approach to quantum mechanics be reconciled with the inﬂuential and
very deep theory of Richard Feynman; see Brown (2005), or even with its
generalization to quantum electrodynamics, see Feynman (1985), and can it be
generalized to quantum ﬁeld theory? A connection between coherent states and
the Feynman path integral was discussed in Sect. 3.6 of Gazeau (2009).
– Can the group theoretical approach used here in some way throw more light upon
elementary particle theory, where group theory is used extensively?
– Can a further development of the discussion here lead to a reconciliation of
quantum theory and relativity theory? It is well known that quantum mechanics
can be extended to take into account the special theory of relativity, but that there
are conceptual difﬁculties involved in ﬁnding a synthesis between conventional
quantum theory and the general theory of relativity. Of course I do not have
any solution to these difﬁculties at present. Already here, however, it is tempting
to suggest that gravitational ﬁelds and related physical quantities are conceptual
variables, and that they are inaccessible inside black holes.
Note that all these questions are connected to my ambitious program of building
a new foundation of quantum mechanics on a theory of epistemic processes. The
simple idea of an epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics is not much
affected.

Aspects of Quantum Theory
In this book I have tried to give a common foundation of statistics and quantum
theory. An important question is then: What is the main feature which make
quantum theory essentially different from classical statistical theory? In my opinion
this main feature is complementarity, a concept that was discussed in detail already
by Niels Bohr, and which will be further elaborated in Chap. 7 below. In the setting
of the previous chapters, this concept may be approached as follows. Assume that
there in some given situation are two different maximally accessible e-variables θa
and θb. Then the vector (θa, θb) is inaccessible, that is, there is no experiment in
which both θa and θb can be measured accurately. Another way to say this is that θa
and θb are complementary. Examples are spin components in different direction of a
single particle; or position and momentum of one particle. Examples abound also in
macroscopic situations, like counterfactual questions concerning one person. These
macroscopic counterfactual situations can perhaps not easily be linked to quantum
theory, but I will insist that my approach towards quantum theory also is important
in macroscopic settings. Note that there also is more than complementarity that
lies behind quantum probabilities; see the assumptions behind the Born formula
discussed earlier in this chapter.
Another approach towards what is needed in addition to complementarity can be
found in the recent paper by Jaeger (2018). In particular, the notion of randomness
as deﬁned precisely there, may seem to be valuable.
A completely different attempt to ﬁnd a uniﬁed approach to statistics, quantum
theory, and relativity theory is given by Frieden (1998, 2004). This attempt is much
more formal, however, and in my view it does not go enough in depth into the
questions discussed.
To emphasize again part of the motivation behind the present book, I cite Hardy
and Spekkens (2010): “Quantum theory is a peculiar creature. It was born as a
theory of atomic physics early in the twentieth century, but over time its scope
has broadened, to the point where it now underpins all of modern physics with the
exception of gravity. It has been veriﬁed to extreme high accuracy and has never
been contradicted experimentally. Yet despite of its enormous success, there is still
no consensus among physicists about what this theory is saying about the nature of
reality.”
What I have tried to do here, is to suggest a new approach to the foundation, and
thereby a new interpretation, by bringing together basic ideas from statistics and
from physics. In the words of John A. Wheeler: “Science owes more to the clash of
ideas than to the steady accumulation of facts.”
The underlying concept of both these sciences is that of an epistemic process: The
process of obtaining knowledge about nature from observations. We begin with an
epistemic question: “What is the value of θ?”, where θ is some conceptual variable.
Then at the end of the process we have some knowledge of θ, in the simplest case
complete knowledge; θ = uk.
In my opinion the approach of the present book may serve to take some of
the mysteries off the ordinary formal introduction to quantum theory. A challenge
for the future will be to develop the corresponding relativistic theory by using
representations of the Poincaré group (the theory of these representations go back

to Wigner 1939) and the link to elementary particle physics using the relevant Lie
group theory. Group theory is an important ingredience in many parts of physics,
and it should be no surprise that it also is relevant for the foundation of quantum
mechanics.
My hope is that the present book will contribute to settling the discussions
around the interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, it seems probable that
this discussion will continue for some time. Arguments for an ontological/realistic
interpretation of the state vector have been put forward by Section 2.12 in Penrose
(2016). On the other hand, Östborn (2016, 2017) has argued in a detailed and formal
way for a quantum model from various epistemic assumptions. Further, in fact
very strong arguments for an epistemic interpretation can be found in the recent
development of cognitive models and decision theory in a quantum theory context.
To understand the recent development of quantum cognitive models, one can take
the famous example by Tversky and Kahneman (1983) as a point of departure. A
number of people were given a description of a woman, Linda, as having been an
outspoken and radical student. Then they were given several options to guess her
state now, including feminist (A), bank teller (B), and also feminist and bank teller
(A ∧B). In a number of versions of this experiment, results were given which seem
to indicate P(A ∧B) > P(B), a conclusion which is impossible by using ordinary
Kolmogorov probability. This and many similar experiments were explained by
Pothos and Busemeyer (2013) by using quantum probability. Op. cit. is a review
and discussion paper where a long range of further references may be found. One
should also mention the research by Aerts and Gabora (2005a,b) who developed a
theory of concepts and their combinations leading to a Hilbert space representation.
Yukalov and Sornette (2014) start by reviewing classical decision theory. Here
different prospects are being characterized by their expected utility, the maxi-
mization of which leads to the most useful prospect. Thereafter a probabilistic
approach is described, in which different actors choose different prospects. Finally,
Quantum Decision Theory is proposed, a theory in which conscious operations and
subconscious activity work in parallel to determine the prospect probabilities.
This Quantum Decision Theory is developed in detail by Yukalov and Sornette
(2010). It is based on the mathematical theory of separable Hilbert spaces. The
theory describes entangled decision-making, non-commutativity of subsequent
decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. They demonstrate
that all known anomalies and paradoxes, documented in the context of classical
decision theory, are reducible to a few mathematical archetypes, all of which ﬁnd a
straightforward explanation in Quantum Decision Theory. A further description of
this will lead beyond any theory of epistemic processes, however.
Another recent treatise advocating an epistemic point of view—in his language
a link between realism and information—is Zeilinger (2010). In that book one
can also ﬁnd nice popular discussions of phenomena like quantum computing,
quantum teleportation, and quantum coding, all closely related to the concept of
entanglement.

A General e-variable Based Approach to Quantum
Theory
Consider the world as seen from the point of view of an observer m. This observer
focuses upon a question a to ask nature. Such a question can always be formulated
in terms of an e-variable θa. In much of this book, θa has been a discrete variable.
However, it could be any variable, real or vector or in principle belonging to any
measurable topological space. The general question is: “What is the value of θa?”
Let the answer to this question be of the form “θa ∈B,” where B is some set. The
essence of quantum theory, motivated from different points of view in this book, is:
The focused question together with its answer is under certain conditions
associated with a closed subspace V ma
B
of some Hilbert space H m, equivalently
with the projector ma
B upon this subspace.
When θa is of a general form (continuous real or vector), this theory based upon
a ﬁnite set of projectors is too simple. However, the following is always true when
the underlying Hilbert space H m is separable: θa for the subject m is under certain
technical conditions associated with a unique self-adjoint operator A = Ama acting
on H m. Let the domain of deﬁnition of Ama be D(Ama). By the spectral theorem
for this operator in the maximally accessible case (for a thorough discussion,
formulation and proof, see Hall (2013)), it is always connected to a resolution of
the identity, a generalization of the PDI of Sect. 5.7.2, or more precisely, a spectral
measure E = Ema. Then the question: “What is the value of θa?” together with
the answer θa ∈B is associated with the projector Ema(B), which is deﬁned on
D(Ama).
The whole theory is only non-trivial when two different questions a and b are
maximal and hence non-compatible, that is:
Assume that a ̸= b can be found such that the vector of e-variables φ = (θa, θb)
is inaccessible, that is, there is no way in which the question ‘What is the value of
φ?’ can be made meaningful for and can be answered completely by the subject m
at any time.
In the words of Niels Bohr, the e-variables θa and θb are then complementary.
To deﬁne a density matrix ρ = ρma, assume that there is a general measure
dθa on the θa-space, and that we have an a priori (or otherwise) probability
distribution π(θa)dθa on this e-variable. Then deﬁne ρma =

π(θa)Ema(dθa).
In the development of Chap. 4, I have assumed that there is a transitive group Ga
acting on θa, and that the measure dθa is left invariant with respect to this group.
Suppose that the observer m wants to measure a new e-variable θb, given that his
state is deﬁned by the density matrix ρma. Then according to Born’s formula in a
perfect measurement, one has P ma(θb ∈B) = trace(ρmaEmb(B)).
In real measurements, one has data z and a probability distribution p(dz|θb). This
results in a operation valued measure (POVM) Mmb(C) =

p(C|θb)Emb(dθb) on
the data space, and a probability model given the state as
P mab(z ∈C) = trace(ρmaMmb(C)).

This is from my point of view the starting point of quantum inference theory.
Note that, in the absence of complementarity, this theory reduces to ordinary
statistical inference theory (Chap.2). The e-variable then is a parameter, a fact
already discussed in Chap. 1.
Of course there are more aspects of a full epistemic quantum theory. One is
the time development given by the Schrödinger equation. Another aspect is the
information exchange between different observers m. In Yukalov et al. (2017) the
latter questions are discussed from a quantum decision point of view.
After an experiment is done, the hold-on principle of Zwirn’s Convivial Solip-
sism is important. From a statistical point of view, the measurement is very often
seen to be summarized in the estimate of the parameter θb. In a discrete quantum
mechanical setting, this estimate may be both very precise and accurate, say, such
that a 99% conﬁdence interval is concentrated on a single point 
θb. Then this value
is held on in all later decisions.
More generally, the estimate may be uncertain, depending on the data. A
conﬁdence interval for θb with coefﬁcient γ , an interval to be held on in this case,
is then found as an interval J such that the probability above leads to
P mab(
θb ∈J) = γ.
The probability measure behind this depends on the state and the operator
Mmb(C), an operator constructed from a positive operator valued measure from
the data space to operators on the Hilbert space H . By Naimark’s theorem (see
for instance Busch et al. (1995)), one can extend the Hilbert space and deﬁne a
projection valued measure (PVM) F mb corresponding to Mmb from the data space
to this new Hilbert space
¯
H . The probabilities are not changed by this, but the
extended Hilbert space can be looked upon as constructed from conceptual variables
both on the parameter space and on a new, hypothetical data space. But this leads
one into the next chapter.

Chapter 6
Connections to Statistical Inference
and Epistemic Probabilities
Abstract This chapter deals with theoretical issues that certainly can be more
extensively discussed. The mathematics of the previous chapters is further devel-
oped, and some implied connections are indicated. My approach to quantum theory
is ﬁrst summarized and made precise in terms of positive operator valued measures
and projection valued measures. Then it is shown that some of the concepts involved
in this development also can be found again in the statistical theory of experimental
design. A possible way to generalize statistical inference inspired by my version
of quantum theory is sketched and indicated to be useful. The partial least squares
regression history is told as an example where it is reasonable to develop reduced
models from conceptual variables. Quantum probabilities can quite generally be
seen as special cases of epistemic probabilities. Aspects of the opposite connection
are also developed.

A Generalization of Statistical Theory
6.1.1
A General E-variable Based Approach to Quantum
Theory
For convenience for those readers that have not read Chap. 5, I repeat the general
views of Sect. 5.14.
Consider the world as seen from the point of view of an observer m. This observer
focuses upon a question a to ask Nature. Such a question can always be formulated
in terms of an e-variable θa. In much of this book, θa has been a discrete variable.
However, it could in principle be any variable, real, vector, or belonging to any
measurable topological space. In this chapter, I will assume that the e-variable space
is contained in Rp for some p. The general question is: “What is the value of θa?”
Assume that the answer to this question is of the form “θa ∈B” for some focused

set B. The essence of quantum theory, motivated from different points of view in
this book, is:
The focused question together with an answer of the above form is associated
with a closed subspace V ma
B
of some Hilbert space H m, equivalently with the
projector Πma
B
upon this subspace. The answer θa /∈B is associated with the
subspace orthogonal to V ma
B .
When θa is a general variable, a theory based upon a ﬁnite set of projectors is too
simple. However, the following is always true when the underlying Hilbert space
H m is separable: θa
for the subject m is connected to a self-adjoint operator
A = Ama acting on H m. Let the domain of deﬁnition of Ama be D(Ama). By
the spectral theorem for this operator (a formulation and proof is given in many
mathematics book; for a thorough discussion, see Hall 2013), it is always connected
to an orthogonal resolution of the identity, or more precisely, a spectral measure
E = Ema. Then the question: “What is the value of θa?” together with the answer
θa ∈B can be associated with the projector Ema(B), which is bounded operator on
the Hilbert space. After a measurement corresponding to this question-and-answer,
any prior state |ψ⟩is projected into a state Ema(B)|ψ⟩, suitably normalized. The
question itself may be connected to the resolution of the identity, i.e., a projection
valued measure (PVM).
The whole theory is only non-trivial when different questions a and b are non-
compatible, that is:
Assume that a ̸= b can be found such that the vector of e-variables φ = (θa, θb)
is inaccessible, that is, there is no way in which the question “What is the value of
φ?” can be made meaningful for and can be answered completely by the observer
m at some given time.
In the words of Niels Bohr, the e-variables θa and θb are then complementary.
More generally, I will assume that each of the two variables is maximally accessible.
More precisely, I will assume that the conditions of Theorem 4.3 are satisﬁed.
To deﬁne a density matrix ρ = ρma, assume that there is a general left invariant
measure dθa on the θa-space, and that we have an a priori (or otherwise) probability
distribution π(θa)dθa on this e-variable. Then deﬁne ρma =

π(θa)Ema(dθa).
More precisely, I will assume that the relevant probability distribution is one out
of three kinds: (1) an a priori Bayesian probability; (2) an a posteriori Bayesian
probability from an earlier experiment; (3) an epistemic probability derived from a
conﬁdence distribution, see Schweder and Hjort (2016); see also below. Note that
in the Bayesian case I will consider any version of Bayesian theory, in particular
subjective or objective interpretations.
Suppose that the observer m wants to measure a new e-variable θb, given that his
state is deﬁned by the density matrix ρma. Then according to Born’s formula in a
perfect measurement one has P ma(θb ∈B) = trace(ρmaEmb(B)). Again I assume
that the assumptions behind the Born formula are satisﬁed; see details in Chap. 5.
In real measurements, one has data z and a probability distribution p(dz|θb).
This results in a positive operator valued measure (POVM) Mmb(C)
=

p(C|θb)Emb(dθb), and a probability model given the state as P mab(z ∈C) =
trace(ρmaMmb(C)). This is the starting point for the general inference theory

discussed in this chapter. I ﬁrst make precise the corresponding Hilbert space
based formalism, then discuss brieﬂy a link to experimental design theory, before
introducing these ideas into a context of a generalized statistical inference theory.
In the absence of complementarity, the Hilbert space is one-dimensional, and the
theory will reduce to ordinary statistical inference theory (Chap. 2). The e-variable
then is a parameter, a fact already discussed in Chap. 1.
6.1.2
Projection Valued and Positive Operator Valued
Measures
Positive operator measures, and their special case projection valued measures
(PVM) form much of the basis for the approach towards quantum physics advocated
by Busch et al. (1995). In that book, a PVM is only deﬁned on Borel subsets of the
real line. I will generalize in the obvious way to Borel subsets of Rp, and assume
that the parameter space (e-variable space) Ωθ is a subset of Rp. A mapping E from
these Borel sets to the set of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H is called
a PVM if
E(B) = E(B)† = E(B)2 for all Borel sets B,
(6.1)
E(Ωθ) = E(Rp) = I,
(6.2)
E(∪i(Bi) =

E(Bi) for all disjoint sequences of Borel sets {Bi}.
(6.3)
The deﬁning properties of a PVM E and the continuity and the additivity
properties of the inner product in H imply that for any unit vector ψ the mapping
B →pE
ψ(B) := ⟨ψ|E(B)ψ⟩
(6.4)
is a probability measure. These real measures give rise to the deﬁnition of a unique
self-adjoint operator A :=

θdE(θ) with its domain of deﬁnition D(A) consisting
of the vectors ψ ∈H for which the integral

θ2⟨ψ|E(dθ)ψ⟩converges. The
converse result is the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators.
Then I turn to the formal deﬁnition of a POVM, connected to a general data
space. First: A linear operator A on some Hilbert space H is positive, A ≥0, if
⟨ψ|Aψ⟩≥0 for all vectors ψ ∈H. A positive vector is always self-adjoint. The
relation A ≥B is deﬁned by A −B ≥0, and this deﬁnes an ordering on the set
of self-adjoined bounded operators. Let ΩZ be a non-empty set and FZ be a σ-
algebra of subsets of ΩZ. A normalized positive operator valued measure (POVM)

172

Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
is a mapping M from F to the bounded linear operators on H such that
M(C) ≥0 for all C ∈F,
(6.5)
M(ΩZ) = I,
(6.6)
M(∪iCi) =

M(Ci) for all disjoint sequences {Ci} ⊂F,
(6.7)
where the series converges in the weak operator topology of these linear operators.
As discussed in detail by Busch et al. (1995), there are several ways in which
a POVM can be constructed from a PVM. One is smearing, which gives a
generalization of statistical modeling. Let the statistical model be given by P(z ∈
C|θ) for sets C ∈FZ for some measurable data space (ΩZ, FZ), where θ now
is a parameter. Then by the theory of Chap. 4, θ can under speciﬁc conditions
be associated with an operator A on some Hilbert space H , and by the spectral
theorem A is associated with a PVM E. Then a smearing of E gives the POVM
from (ΩZ, FZ) to the bounded linear operators on H :
M(C) =

ΩΘ
P(z ∈C|θ)E(dθ).
(6.8)
It is easy to verify that this is a POVM. According to Busch et al. (1995, p. 29), a
given POVM has a representation of the form (6.8) if and only if it is commutative:
[M(C1), M(C2)] = 0 for all C1, C2 ∈FZ. According to Holevo (2001, p. 43),
this result was ﬁrst proved by Holevo (1972). This statement means informally that
all the operators M(C) can be associated with the same measurement. Alternative
construction of POVM’s from PVM’s, see Busch et al. (1995, p. 31), is needed in
the foundation of quantum measurement theory, cp. Jacobs (2014) and Busch et al.
(2016).
By Naimark’s Theorem (see for instance Holevo 2001), every POVM can be
extended to a PVM by extending the Hilbert space.
6.1.3
A Link to Experimental Design
Quantum theory certainly concerns different questions than those addressed by
statistical theory. Nevertheless, if we combine statistical analysis with the planning
of experiments, it is possible to ﬁnd certain connections. At least some of the
concepts used in this book to derive quantum theory may be found again in the
theory of experimental design.
Experimental design in statistics is a large ﬁeld, and I do not in any way want to
go into it in any detail here. A good book on design is Bailey (2008). The design
of an experiment goes together with a statistical analysis of data, in this connection
often what is called an analysis of variance. I will concentrate my remarks here

6.1
A Generalization of Statistical Theory
173
on the so-called orthogonal designs, the analysis of variance of these designs is
described in a review article by Tjur (1984).
Assume that we want to do an experiment with N experimental units. What
corresponds to the Hilbert space above, is then RN. (Quantum mechanics on real
Hilbert spaces has been discussed by some authors, for instance Aleksandrova et al.
(2013).)
A factor φF is a map from the N units into some other ﬁnite set F, the levels of
the factor. Intuitively, a factor F should be thought of as a partitioning of the units
into classes φ−1
F (f ). Bailey (2008) distinguishes sharply between treatment factors,
i.e., factors that are the focus of the investigation, and factors connected to the so-
called block structure, the block factors connected to the design itself. Let nf denote
the number of experimental units on the level f of factor F, and let |F| denote the
number of non-empty classes (nf > 0). A factor F is called balanced if all the
classes are of the same size.
Two factors play a special role as extremes, the trivial factor 0, corresponding to
a constant mapping φ0 : N →0, where 0 is an arbitrary set with a single element,
and the units factor I, corresponding to the identity φI : N →N. The trivial factor
is the “partitioning” into a single class, and I is the partitioning into single units.
Let two factors F and G be given. Suppose that there exists a mapping φFG from
F to G such that for all g ∈G we have g = φFG(f ) for some f ∈F. Then we
say that F is nested in G, and write G ≤F. Two factors will be called equivalent
if F ≤G and G ≤F. The symbol < is used for nested in and non-equivalent. The
relation ≤is a partial ordering of the set of factors. The maximal factor is I and the
minimal factor 0.
For two arbitrary factors F and G their minimum F ∧G can be deﬁned such that
(i) F ∧G ≤F and F ∧G ≤G; (ii) if a factor K is nested into both F and G, then
K is also nested in F ∧G.
The nesting structure of factors is often illustrated in what is called Hasse
diagrams.
On H = RN deﬁne for each F a projection operator PF by (PF )i1i2 = 1/nf
if φF (i1) = φF(i2) = f and (PF )i1i2 = 0 if φF (i1) ̸= φF (i2), and let this project
on a space LF . Then F ≤G if and only if LF ⊆LG. The projection operator PF
corresponds to taking partial means over the subclasses deﬁned by F.
Two factors F and G are said to be orthogonal if PF PG = PGPF . If this is the
case, then PF PG = PF∧G.
Deﬁnition 6.1 An orthogonal design D (as deﬁned by Tjur (1984)) is any class of
factors such that (i) I ∈D; (ii) any two factors in D are orthogonal; (iii) the set D
is closed under the formation of minima.
Two cases are here of interest: (1) Let D consist of all factors; (2) Replace D by
B, the set of block factors, what (Bailey, 2008) calls the block structure. For the
statistical analysis Tjur also assumes that the block factors are balanced.

Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
A main result (Theorem 1 of Tjur (1984)) is
Theorem 6.1 For any orthogonal design D, we have a unique decomposition
RN = ⊕G∈DVG
(6.9)
of the basic Hilbert space as a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces VG (G ∈D),
such that for any F ∈D,
LF = ⊕G∈D,G≤FVG.
(6.10)
Note that (6.9) is equivalent to a decomposition of the unity
I =

G∈D
QG,
(6.11)
where QG is the projection operator onto the space VG. This decomposition is the
basis for the analysis of variance as discussed in Tjur (1984). I will not go into
detail with this analysis of variance. It is an example of hypothesis testing, which
is not much discussed in this book. Only note the following: Let y ∈RN be the
data to be analyzed, and let μ = E(y). Then μ depends on the treatment factors
F. Of particular interest is to test the hypotheses HF : PF μ = 0. Then we can
deﬁne conceptual variables θF by θF = 1 if HF holds, otherwise θF = 0. Then the
hypothesis testing is equivalent to asking the question: “What is the value of θF?”,
and the result of the test of HF can be translated into some conﬁdence probability
for θF .
As mentioned, the decomposition (6.9) and (6.11) is also of interest when D is
replaced by the block factors B. Then VG are referred to as the strata subspaces,
and they can be characterized as the eigenspaces for an operator A which is the
covariance of the observations. Thus (6.11) can be coupled to the spectral theorem.
In an experimental design context, the basis for a probability distribution of
the observation is a randomization of the experimental units. Let B be a block
structure. The randomization appropriate to B (see Bailey 1984) consists of all
permutations π of the N experimental units such that for all block factors B in B
and all units i and j, we have that φB(i) = φB[j) if and only if φB(πi) = φB(πj).
In the terminology of this book (see Appendix F), this means that all the block
factor functions φB are permissible with respect to the permutation group Π. In
particular this implies that Π induces a group of permutations on the levels of B.
The permutation group Π chosen is the maximal one such that all block factors are
permissible (cp. Lemma F2 in Appendix F).
The decomposition of the treatment factors and the analysis of data will not be
considered here; the purpose of this brief review has been just to indicate that some
of the concepts used in my development of quantum theory can—by a suitable
interpretation of the concepts—be found again in an area of classical statistical
theory.

A Generalization of Statistical Theory

For much more on the concrete applications of these concepts and results, see
Bailey (2008).
6.1.4
Generalized Inference
Take as a point of departure the focused generalized likelihood principle (FGLP),
as discussed in Sect. 5.3. Part of my philosophy is that every statistical investigation
should start by posing an experimental question. This question may be decomposed
into a set of elementary questions, but these questions may always be taken as having
a form “What is the value of θ?” for some epistemic conceptual variable θ, which
may be a vector. In addition there is a context τ for the experiment. The purpose of
the experiment is to give some experimental evidence on θ.
Turn again to the situation in Theorem 4.3, so that the quantum mechanical
language is relevant. In the case that θ is discrete, the FGLP says the following:
Given the context, the experimental question and the experimental evidence are
uniquely determined by the likelihood effect
F(u; z, τ) =

k
p(z|τ, θ = uk)|k⟩⟨k|.
(6.12)
Here z is the data of the experiment, and p(z|τ, θ) is the probability density or point
probability of these data according to the chosen statistical model. Corresponding
to the experimental question asked, we have a resolution of the identity
I =

k
|k⟩⟨k|
(6.13)
in some Hilbert space H . In the spirit of this book, each state vector |k⟩is taken
to be associated to a question “What is the value of θ?” together with the sharp
answer “θ = uk.” Recall that we have a context where we assume that several
potential maximally accessible variables θ, thus several experimental questions may
be relevant.
Our ﬁrst task now is to extend this to the case where the variables θ are not
discrete, but vary over a set Ωθ in Rp for some p. This is quite straightforward,
given the results of Chap. 4 and of Sect. 5.3 above.
Proposition 6.1 (The Continuous Focused Likelihood Principle) In general
assume that there is a Hilbert space H and a projection valued measure E over
H with a resolution of the identity I =

ΩΘ E(dθ) such that E(B) corresponds
to the question “What is the value of θ?” with the answer “θ ∈B.” Assume that
one performs an experiment with parameter θ and statistical model with probability
density or point probability p(z|τ, θ), where τ is the context of the experiment. Then
the experimental evidence of this experiment, including the experimental question,

176
6
Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
is uniquely determined by
F(z, τ) =

Ωθ
p(z|τ, θ)E(dθ).
(6.14)
Proof Start with a countable partition of Ωθ, use (6.12), and take limits. The details
are given in Appendix C.
⊓⊔
Remark As seen from the proof, the Focused Likelihood Principle requires certain
assumptions. First, I assume that p(z|τ, θ) for ﬁxed z and τ is continuous in θ,
and tends to zero as ∥θ∥→∞. Next, as in Sect. 5.3, I assume that p(z|τ, θ =
u) = p(z|τ, θ = v) implies u = v. These may well not be the weakest possible
assumptions under which the principle holds.
For the majority of statistical experiments only one experimental question is
relevant. Then one can take the Hilbert space here as one-dimensional, and this
reduces to the ordinary likelihood principle discussed in Chap. 2. Note that in this
case, E(dθ) = I(θ0 ∈dθ) for the “real” value θ0, so F(z, τ) = p(z|τ, θ0).
An exception to this is when one has information related to θ from a previous
experiment involving a related maximal conceptual variable, as in the macroscopic
example of Sect. 5.6.3.
This example is based upon a transitive symmetry group G deﬁned on the
parameter space, and the assumption that the conditions behind the Born formula
hold. Keeping this structure of the experiment, the example can tentatively be
generalized as follows.
Assume that θb is a maximally accessible parameter for an experiment with like-
lihood function l(θb, τ) = p(z|τ, θb). Assume that part of the context can be found
as follows: One has performed an earlier experiment on the same experimental
units with a maximally accessible parameter θa. Assume that (i) the assumptions
behind quantum theory as developed in Chap.4 hold for both experiments, and
the same Hilbert space H can be used to describe both experiments; (ii) The
assumptions behind the Born formula (Sects. 5.5 and 5.6) hold. The result from
the ﬁrst experiment is then given by a density operator ρa, and the experimental
evidence of the second experiment is uniquely determined by
F(z, τ) =

ΩΘb
p(z|τ, θb)Eb(dθb),
(6.15)
where the PVM Eb corresponds to the question “What is the value of θb?”.
Assuming a rational epistemic setting as in Chap. 5, a continuous version of the
Born formula may be derived from this.
Integrating over the data z gives the POVM Mb(C, τ) =

C F(z, τ)dz, and from
an extended version of Born’s formula we ﬁnd
P ab(z ∈C|τ) = tr(ρaMb(C, τ)).
(6.16)

6.2
On Epistemic Probabilities
177
Alternatively, Born’s formula gives
P ab(θb ∈B) = tr(ρaEb(B)).
(6.17)
This last formula gives an epistemic probability distribution of θb. Before I
proceed, I will give a review of epistemic probabilities in general, partly seen from
a quantum theoretical point of view.
6.2
On Epistemic Probabilities
6.2.1
Quantum Probabilities in Psychology
In Busemeyer and Bruza (2012) and Pothos and Busemeyer (2013) the basic
arguments for the use of quantum theory in cognitive modeling are reviewed. I
will look into those arguments, but will use a different macroscopic setting as an
example: Assume that a single medical patient is to be described in the mind of
some medical doctor. The doctor has examined the patient; this examination can be
seen as an epistemic process as described in this book: He has asked a number of
questions and obtained answers to those questions. The state of the patient (in the
mind of the doctor) can then be given ideally as some vector |ψ⟩in some Hilbert
space H .
The doctor has to choose one out of two medicines A or B. He can
only choose one medicine, but he is also interested in the effect of the other
medicine. From his earlier experience and from the information that he has, he
wants to estimate P(A helps), P(B helps), P(A helps and also B helps), and
P(B helps and also A helps). These are epistemic probabilities.
The doctor has to take some decision. The epistemic probabilities exist only in
his mind, but this may be a helpful way of thinking in order to reach a decision.
According to Pothos and Busemeyer (2013), one must distinguish between two
situations: The medicines are compatible or they are not compatible. I would
rather say coupled or uncoupled. One could say dependent or independent, but the
dependence here is rather special. The compatible/uncoupled case is the simplest
conceptually (but a little more complicated in the quantum theory language; it
requires the use of tensor products). Then A and B are independent, and
P(A helps and also B helps) = P(B helps and also A helps)
= P(A helps)P(B helps).
The incompatible/coupled case is more complicated conceptually, and can
according to loc. cit. be described in quantum theory language: In H there are
two orthogonal spaces, one indicating that A helps, and another indicating that A

178
6
Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
does not help. Let PA and QA = I −PA be the projections upon these spaces. Then
according to Born’s formula we have
P(A helps) = ∥PA|ψ⟩∥2.
After the doctor is given the information that medicine A helps, then according
to quantum theory the patient’s state changes to
|ψA⟩=
PA|ψ⟩
∥PA|ψ⟩∥.
In a completely similar way there are two other orthogonal spaces, one indicating
that B helps, and another indicating that B does not help. Let PB and QB = I −PB
be the projections upon these spaces. Then Born’s formula gives
P(B helps|A helps) = ∥PB|ψA⟩∥2.
This gives
P(A helps and also B helps) = P(A helps)P(B helps|A helps) = ∥PBPA|ψ⟩∥2.
Some non-classical conclusions follow from this. The ﬁrst observation is that
typically
P(A helps and also B helps) ̸= P(B helps and also A helps).
The marginal probability that B helps is P(B helps) = ∥PB|ψ⟩∥2. Then by a
geometric argument it can be seen that there exists situation where
P(A helps and also B helps) > P(B helps).
Also, the law of total probability does not hold. There is additivity in the
probability amplitudes:
PA|ψ⟩= PBPA|ψ⟩+ QBPA|ψ⟩= a + b,
so that
P(A helps) = ∥PA|ψ⟩∥2 = |a|2 + |b|2 + a∗b + ab∗.
But
P(A helps and also B helps) + P(A helps but B does not help) = |a|2 + |b|2.

6.2
On Epistemic Probabilities
179
All these probabilities may be thought of as describing what is going on in
the mind of the doctor before he makes a decision. Similar qualitative conducts
of probabilities in the minds of people have been observed empirically in many
investigations; see references in Pothos and Busemeyer (2013). It is interesting in
itself that quantum probabilities may be connected to our minds.
A major conclusion from this discussion is that quantum probabilities do not in
general satisfy Kolmogorov’s axioms; see Sect. 2.1.1. A large class of probabilities
that also in general may not satisfy Kolmogorov’s axioms, are the epistemic
probabilities, to be discussed in the next subsections.
6.2.2
Introduction to Epistemic Probabilities
What is the probability of rain tomorrow? Given some information about a student
Tom W., what is the probability that he studies computer science? These are exam-
ples of epistemic probabilities: probabilities of some aspect of the real world, given
some accumulated knowledge. Such probabilities should be sharply distinguished
from aleatoric probabilities, probabilities associated with dice throwing or with
potential data in statistical models. The foundation of the latter probabilities was
discussed in Chap. 2.
Epistemic probabilities are often uncertain and based upon subjective judgment.
The last of the above examples, the student Tom W., was discussed in some detail
by Kahneman (2011). First we are given only the information that Tom W. is a
graduate student at some university, and the enrollment data for the 9 subject areas
of education given by that university. Then it is reasonable to give an epistemic
probability proportional to the enrollment for computer science compared to the
other areas. This is what Kahneman calls base rates.
Next, Kahneman (2011) describes a personality sketch of Tom W. given by a
psychologist. Tom W. is described as highly intelligent, but lacking creativity. He
seems to have little feel for and sympathy with others, and so on. Kahneman’s point
here (which admittedly gives a very nasty picture of computer scientists) is that for
most people, their probability that Tom W. studies computer science will increase
after such a description.
In this section, I will discuss a somewhat more precise theory of epistemic
probabilities both from the point of view of quantum theory and from the point
of view of statistical theory.
Take quantum theory ﬁrst. The probabilities here are given by Born’s formula,
which give probability distributions for the conceptual variable of a future perfect
experiments, given some state, determined by the value of some, previously
measured, maximally accessible conceptual variable. As I have said repeatedly,
these conceptual variables are connected to the mind of an observer or to the minds
of a set of communicating observers. But very often, they are also connected to some
property of the real world. In all such cases, the quantum probabilities are epistemic
probabilities.

Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
Next take the point of view of a statistician. Assume that we have done an
experiment or some set of experiments given a parameter (e-variable) θ. Can we
give any probability distribution for θ in this situation?
For a Bayesian, either subjective or objective, the answer is simple: He simply
gives his posterior distribution of θ. For use in classical situations, Bayes formula
for posterior distributions are given in many textbooks; see also Sect. 2.1.3.
But I also want to study the corresponding problem for a frequentist, a statis-
tician, or scientist that is not able to ﬁnd any prior for θ, and therefore also is
unable to specify a posterior distribution. Epistemic probabilities for this situation
are for instance discussed by Schweder and Hjort (2016). I want to give an additional
quantitative theory. This theory will have some resemblance with my development
of quantum theory, but is completely classical.
6.2.3
On Some Conceptual Variables
Assume that we want to report the results of some experiment, where we have
data z1 ∈ΩZ, and the parameter of the statistical model is θ ∈Ωθ. As part of
the philosophy behind epistemic distributions, for instance conﬁdence distributions
(see Sect. 2.1.3), we will have in mind hypothetical data z2 which have the
same distribution as z1, given the parameter. The point is then that the epistemic
distribution for θ, given z2 has the same form as the epistemic distribution for θ,
given z1. In the notation of Chaps. 1 and 4, we then have an inaccessible conceptual
variable φ
= (z1, θ, z2). An accessible subvariable, an epistemic conceptual
variable or e-variable ζ is given by ζ = (z1, θ); another e-variable is the parameter
θ. Note that contrary to most of the discussion of this book, here ζ is not a parameter,
but it is a conceptual variable as deﬁned here, that is, a variable that can be deﬁned
in words by some person, here a scientist deﬁning the statistical model.
We may for instance have in mind a situation where the conﬁdence distribution
is found from a pivot p(z, θ), where P(p(z, θ) ≤u) = 1 −α. From this, we
can ﬁnd the epistemic distribution for θ, given z. But we may also have more
general situations in mind. The sole requirement is that there shall be some epistemic
probability distribution for θ, given the data z.
In the rest of this section, I will make symmetry assumptions as in Chap. 4.
I will assume that there is a group G∗acting on the sample space Z and a
corresponding group G acting upon the parameter space Ωθ. This group G is
assumed to be transitive. The connection between these two groups are given by
P gθ(z ∈C) = P θ(z ∈g∗C). The mapping from g∗to g is a homomorphism: If
g∗= g∗
1g∗
2, then the corresponding g is g1g2.
In the notation of Chap. 4, see also Appendix F, we have here the group K =
G∗⊗G ⊗G∗acting upon φ and the group G acting upon θ. The group acting on
ζ = (z1, θ) is ˜G = G∗⊗G. In general, a group K acting on a variable φ induces a
group G on θ, where θ = θ(φ) is a function of φ, when this function is permissible,
that is, the following holds: θ(φ1) = θ(φ2) implies θ(kφ1) = θ(kφ2) for all k ∈K.

6.2
On Epistemic Probabilities
181
Lemma 6.1 θ and ζ here are permissible.
Proof Assume ζ1(φ) = (z1
1, θ1) = ζ2(φ) = (z1
2, θ2) and k = (g∗
1, g, g∗
2). Then
ζ1(kφ) = (g∗
1z1
1, gθ1) = θ2(kφ) = (g∗
1z1
2, gθ2), and permissibility follows. The
proof is similar for θ.
⊓⊔
Another general useful notion in connection to accessible/inaccessible concep-
tual variables is that of maximality: If the accessible conceptual variable η can be
written as η = f (ψ) for a function f which is not one-to-one, then the conceptual
variable ψ is not accessible.
Lemma 6.2 ζ here is maximal.
Proof Assume that ζ = f (ψ) and ψ = r(φ) for some conceptual variable ψ. This
is only possible when f is a one-to-one function.
⊓⊔
Thus the variables and groups deﬁned here ﬁt into the setting described in general
in this book. The main purpose of Chap. 4 was to provide a group theoretical
motivation for one of the two main axioms of quantum theory. For this, we had to
use some basic group representation theory. Here I will concentrate on probabilities.
The basis for development is the statistical model, given by a probability density
function p(z|θ, τ), which for ﬁxed context τ either can be seen as a function of ζ
or a function of ξ = (z2, θ), which also is a maximal conceptual variable. As in
Schweder and Hjort (2016) and Xie and Singh (2013), we can use this to derive a
conﬁdence distribution for θ. In Sect. 2.1.3 this was only deﬁned for a scalar θ, but
it can be extended to the case where θ is a vector in Rp. One approach is then ﬁrst
to choose a one-dimensional focus parameter η = η(θ), a subparameter of interest.
A crucial question in my setting is then: Is η permissible as seen as a function of θ?
If it is permissible, a conﬁdence distribution for η may be derived from an eventual
conﬁdence distribution for θ. As in Lemma 4.3 the following holds: If the original
group acting on θ is transitive, the induced group acting on η will also be transitive.
The opposite of this does not hold.
6.2.4
Epistemic Probabilities from Conﬁdence Distributions
Recall my deﬁnition of conﬁdence distribution from Sect. 2.1.3:
Deﬁnition 6.1 Let the one-dimensional parameter η be a function of the total
parameter θ. Then H(η, z) is a cumulative conﬁdence distribution for η provided
that it is uniformly distributed under the distribution of z, whatever the true value
of θ.
Alternatively: Let (−∞, t(γ, z)] be a one-sided conﬁdence interval for η with
conﬁdence coefﬁcient γ , where t(γ ) = t(γ, z) is an increasing function. Then
H(·) = t−1(·) is the conﬁdence distribution for η. A cumulative conﬁdence
distribution gives a conﬁdence probability, an epistemic probability. As noted below,

182
6
Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
in this one-dimensional case, the conﬁdence distribution is identical to Fisher’s
ﬁducial distribution.
Conﬁdence distributions are often found by means of a pivot. A function
piv(η, z2), in the notation of the previous subsection, is a pivot if its distribution
function G(u) = P(piv(η, z2) ≤u) is independent of the underlying parameter θ.
If the pivot is increasing in η, we can take H(η, z1) = G(piv(η, z1)).
As a simple example, consider a single observation z, which is assumed to be
N(μ, 1). Then μ −z is a pivot for μ and is N(0, 1). Let Φ(·) be the cumulative
distribution function for the standard normal distribution. Then H(μ, z) = Φ(μ −
z) = 1−Φ(z−μ) is a cumulative distribution function for μ. Alternatively we may
say that the conﬁdence distribution for μ, given z, is N(z, 1), a genuine epistemic
probability distribution. A more general example is provided if we let z be the mean
of n independent observations, each N(μ, σ 2) with known σ.
Conﬁdence distributions should be considered as a frequentist alternative to
Bayesian posterior distributions, an alternative to be considered in cases where
no prior distribution of η can be found. Traditionally, the discussion between
frequentists and Bayesians has been hard, but in more recent years syntheses
between these two worlds have been developed. For instance, in connection to
hypothesis testing, (Bickel, 2020) has recently proposed a more general concept of
evidence model, a function of both η and z as an attempt to build an overview over
frequentist and Bayesian inference. Since I do not discuss much hypothesis testing
in this book, and do not at all consider the important empirical Bayes method, I will
build the rest of this subsection on the conﬁdence distribution concept as discussed
by Schweder and Hjort (2016).
This discussion must also necessarily be brief. Consider the multivariate version
of the example above, that is, z is p-dimensional and N(μ, Σ) with known covariate
matrix Σ. Then there are several methods to ﬁnd a conﬁdence distribution of μ. One
natural is again to consider the pivot z−μ, which has a known distribution N(0, Σ).
From this we ﬁnd a conﬁdence distribution assigning conﬁdence to “interval” {μ :
μ ≤z} in Rp. Then the debate in the literature has clariﬁed that such a conﬁdence
probability cannot be extended to arbitrary functions of μ. In the conceptual basis
of this book, there is a transitive group μ →μ + a on the parameter space here,
and I will argue that a conﬁdence probability can be extended to η = ψ(μ) if the
function ψ is permissible with respect to this group.
Similar, and perhaps more acute, difﬁculties occur when part of Σ is unknown.
If Σ is totally unknown, we have a transitive group (μ, Σ) →(Aμ + b, AΣA′)
with arbitrary matrix A and vector b on the parameter space.
A general important problem is that of marginalization in the multivariate case.
Before saying more about this problem, I turn to Fisher’s ﬁducial theory, which is
identical to the theory of conﬁdence distribution in the one-dimensional case, but
which Fisher wrongly thought could be extended to a probability theory satisfying
Kolmogorov’s axioms in the multivariate case.

6.3
Fiducial Theory
183
6.3
Fiducial Theory
Fiducial inference as an alternative to Bayesian inference was ﬁrst proposed by
Fisher in several papers and books, has been in discredit for many years, but has
been the subject to many investigations recently. I discuss it here not only because
it is a distinctly new approach to statistical inference, different from frequentist and
Bayesian inference, but also because it, through its group theoretical foundation has
some similarities to the approach towards quantum theory advocated in Chap. 4.
6.3.1
The Group Theory Approach
The discussion of this subsection is based on Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2013).
Consider a statistical model (Ωz, Ez, P θ
z |θ ∈Ωθ), and assume that the loss of an
action a ∈Ωa is of the form l = γ (θ, a). Both θ and z are deﬁned on an underlying
abstract conditional probability space (Ω, E , P).
Assume that there is a group G deﬁned on the parameter space. It is an essential
assumption that the group G is transitive on Ωθ, and that the isotropy group is trivial.
Then we can ﬁx θ0 ∈Ωθ and establish a one-to-one correspondence between g and
θ by θ = gθ0. Consider the case where the group actions on Ωθ, Ωz, and Ωa are
isomorphic, so that we can use the same symbol g for all these group actions. This
can be generalized.
Let now u be a random quantity such that P(u ∈B) = P(z ∈B|θ = θ0) holds
identically for all B, and u is independent of θ. (I consider only what Taraldsen
and Lindqvist called the conventional case.) The group invariance of the statistical
model implies P θ
z = P θ0
gz, and since by the deﬁnition of u it follows that the law of
gz, given θ = θ0 is equal to the law of gu, this also equals P θ
gu. It follows that
(z|θ) ∼(gu|θ),
(6.18)
where the notation (w1|θ) ∼(w2|θ) in general means just P θ
w1 = P θ
w2.
Now following Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2013) we deﬁne
Deﬁnition 6.2 (Fiducial Model)
A ﬁducial model (u, ζ) is given by a random
variable u deﬁned on a space Ωu and a measurable function ζ : Ωu ⊗Ωθ →Ωz,
where Ωz is the sample space of a statistical model {P θ
z |θ ∈Ωθ}. This is the ﬁducial
model for the given statistical model if
(ζ(u, θ)|θ) ∼(z|θ).
(6.19)
In particular it follows from this deﬁnition and the construction given in
connection to (6.18) above, that (u, ζ) with
ζ(u, θ) = gu
(6.20)

184
6
Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
is a ﬁducial model for the statistical model {P θ
z |θ ∈Ωθ} deﬁned there, where g is
the unique group element corresponding to θ.
It is crucial in this approach to ﬁducial theory that the parameter θ is acted upon
by a transitive group G, and that this group also acts on the conceptual variables
u, a, and z.
A ﬁducial model (u; ζ) is called simple if the ﬁducial equation ζ(u, θ) = z has a
unique solution θz(u) when solved for θ for all (u, z). In the simple case, the ﬁducial
distribution is deﬁned as the distribution of θz(u) given θ.
In Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2013), the following theorem was proved:
Theorem 6.2 In the above case, the risk of an equivariant rule is determined by a
ﬁducial distribution.
In the setting above, an equivariant rule is determined by gδ(x) = δ(gx), where
g again is a group element in unique correspondence with θ and acting ﬁrst on Ωa,
then on Ωz. The risk is deﬁned from the loss function l = γ (θ, a), and this loss
function is assumed to be invariant (γ (gθ, ga) = γ (θ, a)). The risk is
ρ = E(γ (θ, δ(z))|θ).
(6.21)
Theorem 6.2 was proved earlier for the case that a right invariant prior exists
on the parameter space. For this case the ﬁducial distribution coincides with the
corresponding posterior, as proved by Fraser (1961).
Again it is crucial that the group G is assumed to be transitive on the parameter
space (compare my use of the same condition in Chap. 4).
Several examples of application of this result are referred to in Taraldsen and
Lindqvist (2013).
6.3.2
Fisher’s Original Argument and Conﬁdence
Distributions
Let T be a one-dimensional statistic, whose distribution is uniquely determined by
θ, a one-dimensional parameter. Fisher considered the case where T is the maximum
likelihood estimator of θ. Suppose that T has a continuous distribution, and let
F(t, θ) denote the cumulative distribution function for T . Assume, as often is the
case, that for ﬁxed t, F(t, θ) is an increasing function of θ. Fix a probability p, let
Tobs be the observed value of T , and let the ﬁducial p-quantile be the solution for θ
to p = 1 −F(Tobs, θ). The ﬁducial distribution function for θ is thus
C(θ) = 1 −F(Tobs, θ).

Fiducial Theory
185
This is exactly what in Schweder and Hjort (2016) is called a conﬁdence distri-
bution. Thus in one dimension the concepts of conﬁdence distribution and ﬁducial
distribution coincide.
6.3.3
Subparameters and Fiducial Models
Fisher’s original arguments were largely based on examples, and some of the
problems of these examples were that they sometimes did not behave as expected
under marginalization. Using the group approach, we will see how this connects to
the concept of permissibility.
Theorem 6.3 Let (u, ζ) be a ﬁducial model for a statistical model {P θ
z |θ ∈Ωθ}
based on a transitive group G acting on Ωθ. Let η = η(θ) be a subparameter such
that {P η
y |η ∈η(Ωθ)} is a statistical model for a function y = y(z). Then this last
model has a ﬁducial model if the function η(·) is permissible and the induced group
on η has a trivial isotropy group.
Proof By Lemma 4.3 of Chap. 4 there exists a transitive group ˜G on the range of
η(·), and by assumption this group has a trivial isotropy group. Fix θ0 as in the
paragraph before Deﬁnition 6.2, and let η0 = η(θ0). Fixing the distribution of y at
η0, we have identically in A: P(u ∈y−1(A) = P(z ∈y−1(A)|θ = θ0) = P(y ∈
A|η = η0), so v = y(u) can be taken as a ﬁducial basis for the model P η
y . We can
take ξ(v, η) = ˜gv.
⊓⊔
Example 1 Let z ∼N(μ, 1) under the translation group G : μ →μ + c. Then
gu = z −μ deﬁnes a ﬁducial model. Then as pointed out in Schweder and Hjort
(2016), this does not induce a ﬁducial model on |μ|. This is consistent with the fact
that the function μ →|μ| is not permissible.
Example 2 Let z = (¯x, s2) from a N(μ, σ 2) sample x1, . . . , xn under the transla-
tion and scale group G : μ →bμ+c, σ →bσ, which is transitive on the parameter
space. Let η = η(μ, σ) be a one-dimensional subparameter. Then, according to
Theorem F2(f) of Appendix F, η(·) is permissible, and thus it induces a ﬁducial
model if and only if it is a one-to-one function of a1μ + a2σ for constants a1 and
a2. This is in agreement with the ﬁndings of Pedersen (1978).
Example 3 (The Behrens–Fisher Problem) Let z
=
(¯x1, s2
1, ¯x2, s2
2) from two
independent samples, N(μi, σ 2
i ) (i = 1, 2) under the transitive group G : μ1 →
b1μ + c1, σ1 →b1σ1, μ2 →b2μ2 + c2, σ2 →b2σ2. Then it is straightforward
to show the subparameter μ1 −μ2 is not permissible, and this can be seen as the
source of Fisher’s problems with this example.

Discussion
6.4.1
Connection between Approaches to Statistical Inference
For an outsider it may be confusing that there are several schools of statistical
inference. Then it is reassuring that there are connections between these schools.
First, in cases where there is very much data, the different theories give essentially
the same result. In these cases, the effect of the choice if prior vanishes almost
completely.
An even closer connection between the theories exists when there is a group G
deﬁned on the parameter space. Then there is a classical result by Fraser (1961)
saying that the ﬁducial distribution coincides with the posterior distribution from
the right invariant measure as a Bayesian prior if such a right invariant measure
exists.
A group action on Ωθ is called proper if the inverse image of any compact
set under the mapping (g, θ) →(gθ, θ) is compact. By a theorem of Weil, the
right invariant measure exists if the group action is proper and the group is locally
compact (see Helland (2010) for details).
There is also a close connection between frequentist inference and Bayesian
inference with right invariant prior. This follows from Fraser’s result and the fact
that in the one-dimensional case conﬁdential probabilities and ﬁducial probabilities
are identical.
6.4.2
More on Epistemic Probabilities
A major discussion theme is to which extent epistemic probabilities can be seen in
some generality as quantum probabilities. The other way it is quite clear: Quantum
probabilities are epistemic probabilities as long as they are connected to epistemic
processes related to the real world.
But look at epistemic probabilities in general, and look upon the way I introduced
the quantum formalism in Chap.4. There I assumed a group G deﬁned on the space
of the conceptual variable (here the parameter, θ), and relied essentially on four
assumptions:
Assumption 1 There exists a left invariant measure dθ on the space ΩΘ.
Assume further that by an eventual model reduction to an orbit of the group (see
Sect. 2.2 for this principle; the main motivation for such a reduction in general is
that G also shall be a group for the reduced model, but it can also be motivated by
several simple examples) we have arrived at a model where

6.4
Discussion
187
Assumption 2 G is transitive on ΩΘ. Furthermore, the isotropy group of G is
trivial.
Fix a point θ0 ∈ΩΘ. The general point θ ∈ΩΘ is of the form θ = gθ0.
Assumption 3 There exists a unitary irreducible representation U(·) of the group
G on some Hilbert space H such that the coherent states U(g)|θ0⟩, where |θ0⟩is
some ﬁxed vector in H , are in one-to-one correspondence with g and hence with θ.
Assumption 4 θ is maximally accessible, and in the given context there is another
maximally accessible variable θ′. We have θ = θ(φ) for an inaccessible variable φ,
and θ′ = θ(kφ) for a group element k ∈K, a group acting upon φ.
To further introduce quantum probabilities, one must look at the assumptions
behind the Born formula, as discussed in Chap. 5: The likelihood principle holds,
and either the observer or the assumed ideal actor behind the observer are perfectly
rational as determined by the Dutch book principle. Also, θ must be maximally
accessible.
Theorem 6.4 Under the above assumptions the epistemic probabilities connected
to θ can be seen as quantum probabilities.
6.4.3
Stone’s Theorem and the Foundation of Statistical
Inference
The conclusions made in applied statistics are in general given by a number of
statements, propositions about parameters, and we may assume that the set of all
these propositions form a Boolean algebra. The tradition in statistics is to associate
such Boolean algebras with set theory, and in fact this association can be made
precise. Mathematically, a Stone space is a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff
space; these details are not too important. But Stone’s representation theorem
(Stone, 1936) says that every Boolean algebra B is connected to a Stone space
S(B) in the following sense: The topology on S(B) is generated by a (closed) basis
consisting of all sets of the form {x ∈S(B)|b ∈x}. Then every Boolean algebra B
is isomorphic to the algebra of subsets of its Stone space S(B) that are both closed
and open.
The problem is to which extent one can associate probabilities to all such propo-
sitions about parameters. Here the answer depends on which school in statistical
inference you belong to. An extreme Bayesian will be willing to assign probabilities
to all propositions. Most statisticians ﬁnd themselves in an in-between position, for
some statements they can associate probabilities, epistemic probabilities, for some
statements they cannot. Sometimes, like when the problem in question has some
symmetry and we can associate a prior to the right invariant measure of a transitive
group G, one can be a full Bayesian, but often this attitude is not possible.

Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
Concerning uncertainty about epistemic statements, one can distinguish between
at least three cases. (1) One is not able to assign any numerical probability to
the statement. (2) The uncertainty can be coupled to a model, and from model
considerations it is possible to assign some probability to it. (3) The uncertainty
is due to the data. In the last case, we have again two subcases: The uncertainty can
either be quantiﬁed by a posterior derived from some Bayesian prior, or one does
not have a prior but can rely on probabilities derived from conﬁdence distributions
as they are discussed above.
6.5
The Partial Least Squares Regression History
A main message of this book is that scientists from different cultures may learn from
each other. In this chapter, I have indicated through the discussion of several topics,
that certain conceptual developments in quantum theory also may have implications
for statistical theory. A completely different area where, in my opinion, statisticians
may learn something from recent developments in another scientiﬁc culture, is that
of partial least squares regression.
Partial least squares regression was discussed in Example 2.6 of Sect. 2.2, but it
really belongs to this chapter. Assume in general that one has data on n units: p
explanatorial variables xi1, xi2, . . . , xip and a response variable Yi, (i = 1, . . . , n).
The problematic case is when we have p > n. This is really paradoxical: We have
problems when we have much information on the units!
Let us be a little more precise. Collect the data into vectors x1, . . . , xp and Y.
Suppose that our problem is connected to a new unit where we have explanatory
variables x01, x02, . . . , x0p, and from these we want to predict the unknown
response Y0. When p is small, the standard solution is to use a linear regression
model:
Yi = β0 +

j
βjxij + Ei,
(6.23)
where the error terms Ei are assumed to be independent with expectation 0 and
variance σ 2, and independent of the variables xij.
One standard argument here is to use the conditionality principle: The explana-
tory variables xi1, xi2, . . . , xip are ancillary, have a distribution which is indepen-
dent of what we want to achieve, so one should condition on them. But wait a
minute: What we want to achieve, is to predict Y0 from x01, x02, . . . , x0p, and
this research question involves explanatory variables on some new, similar unit.
So the conditionality principle is not relevant here. I will choose to assume that
xi1, xi2, . . . , xip for i = 0, 1, . . . , n are random variables, with the same distribution
for each i and independent over i, and seen as a vector over p it has expectation μ
and covariance matrix Σx. I may assume multinormality, but this is unnecessary.

6.5
The Partial Least Squares Regression History
189
To make the discussion a little easier, I will use a trivial simplifying assumption:
I will assume that all variables are centered, so that we may take μ = 0 and β0 = 0.
The regression equation may then be written:
Yi = β′xi· + Ei,
(6.24)
where the regression vector β is (β1, . . . , βp)′.
All this is well when p < n, and the x-variables are not collinear. Then the
solution is found by using the least squares estimate of β, and there is a large
and fairly simple statistical theory. In particular, this also gives the (conditional)
maximum likelihood solution in the multinormal case. Of course, in this case we
take Y0 = β′x0·, where x′
0· = x01, x02, . . . , x0p.
But what when p
>
n? Then the least squares solution does not exist.
Statisticians from various schools have proposed a large number of solutions for
this case: ridge regression, principal component regression, latent root regression,
and so on.
Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, various people from the chemometric community
proposed a somewhat strange solution, an algorithm called the partial least squares
algorithm. I will not go into detail about this algorithm, but it seemed to have a
very nice property: It worked! And simulations seemed to show that it worked very
well. From this, the chemometrician developed a concept called “soft modeling.”
Statisticians were largely skeptical to this whole development: Modeling should
involve parameters, not data.
In Helland (1990) a purely parametric approach to partial least squares regression
(PLSR) was proposed. The basic ingrediences were the regression vector β and the
x-covariance matrix Σx. Two formulations were shown to be equivalent, and both
could be seen as interpretations of the sample PLSR algorithm:
(1) Consider the expansion β = p
i=1 γidi, where d1, . . . , dp is a complete set of
eigenvectors of Σx. The PLSR model with m factors is deﬁned as the model
where this expansion is reduced to exactly m terms. One does not say anything
about which eigenvectors are involved in the expansion.
(2) Let σ = Σ−1
x β, and consider the Krylov sequence σ, Σxσ, Σ2
xσ, Σ3
xσ, . . ..
The PLSR model with m factors is the model where the space spanned by this
sequence has dimension m.
These ideas were developed further in a few papers: In Helland (1992) the
maximum likelihood estimator of β under the PLSR model was derived. In Næs
and Helland (1993) the concept of relevant components, the eigenvectors correlated
with β (cf. (1) above) was discussed in detail, and this concept was related to other
regression methods in Helland and Almøy (1994). The group theoretical approach
towards the PLSR model was discussed in Helland et al. (2012).
From 2010 on, a new development took place. In the long paper (Cook et al.,
2010) the important general envelope model was proposed and discussed, and in
Cook et al. (2013) it was shown that the PLSR model was a special case of
the envelope model. A large number of papers on the envelope model have been

190
6
Connections to Statistical Inference and Epistemic Probabilities
published by Dennis Cook and his collaborators in the last decade, and the theory
is summarized in the book (Cook, 2018). As estimation in this model is concerned,
the development is dominated by maximum likelihood estimation, which does not
work for p > n.
What is the situation now? The partial least squares algorithm has been applied
in an increasingly large number of ﬁelds; see an overview by Mahmood and Ahmed
(2015). From a statistical point of view, much is still unknown about the algorithm,
but see the recent paper by Cook and Forzani (2019) and references there. In the
latter paper, asymptotic expansions also in the case p →∞were studied, and the
algorithm was shown to have good statistical properties when many x-variables have
non-zero regression coefﬁcient (no sparsity).
What has this to do with my approach towards quantum theory? The reason why
the PLSR model and the envelope model have so nice mathematical properties,
is that they are based upon conceptual variables, in the PLSR model case β and
Σx. In my opinion, quantum theory should also be seen as based on conceptual
variables. Of particular interest are conceptual variables which can be related to
measurements, epistemic conceptual variables, or e-variables. These constituted the
beginning of this book, and I choose to end the mathematical discussion here.
6.6
Quantum Measurements
In this chapter and also in the previous chapters, I have looked upon measurements
from a statistical point of view. In the quantum mechanical literature, a more
advanced treatment of measurements is discussed. One starts with considering two
systems, a probe and a target, and applies unitary transformations on the joint state.
To understand quantum measurements properly and in particular to clarify which
approach one should have to measurements in quantum mechanical examples, is, as
I see it, an important problem. This problem is perhaps the most pressing open issue
left by this book.
For more on quantum measurements from the point of view of quantum theorists,
I refer to Jacobs (2014) and, for a more advanced treatment (Busch et al., 2016).

Chapter 7
Macroscopic Consequences
Abstract So far, this book has been focused on science and on scientiﬁc inves-
tigations. In my opinion, the conclusions from these investigations also have
implications for daily life and daily life decisions. Starting from some general
philosophical considerations, I go on and describe Hervé Zwirn’s convivial solip-
sism again, and in a ﬁnal Section I give a fairly wide and general discussion of the
process of making decisions in general. Decisions can be made by single persons
or by groups of communicating persons. They may be inﬂuenced by a (common)
context, and they have consequences on the way we act. In my opinion, Niels Bohr’s
concept of complementarity may be seen as an important background for many
of our decisions. Finally, a concrete discussion of the process of making political
decisions is given.
7.1
General Philosophical Considerations
To repeat the views of this book: The quantum formulation can be seen as having
primarily not to do with how nature is, but with our process of obtaining knowledge
about nature. We focus on certain questions to nature, and obtain answers to those
focused questions. I indicate in different ways that essential parts of the quantum
formulation can be derived by considering such a process—an epistemic process.
These are relatively deep results which require some mathematics to derive.
Who is this “we” who ask questions and obtain answers? It can be a single
observer or a group of communicating observers. The epistemic process that this
(these) observers perform(s) can be likened to statistical inference in some way, and
the quantity which he/she (they) ask questions about and obtain information on, can
be likened to a statistical parameter. I have introduced a new name, an e-variable, to
cover both parameters in statistics and these physical quantities.
I claim that the basic principles of statistics, the conditionality principle, the
sufﬁciency principle, and the likelihood principle can be generalized to all inference
on parameters and on e-variables connected to experiments.
I go on and derive the Born formula from a version of the likelihood principle
together with an assumption of rationality. Also, the Schrödinger equation is derived

from an assumption of observers taking into account both σ-algebras in the past and
in the future.
I stress that my theory is not a hidden variable theory, although it bears some
resemblance with such a theory. The inaccessible variable φ is not a hidden
variable, but a mathematical variable upon which group actions may be deﬁned.
The e-variables are not hidden variables, but closely connected to the epistemic
processes. (Note that the parameters of statistics exist only in our minds.) Also:
Doing inference has to do with intuitive processes in the brain, and the brain is no
computer and cannot be simulated by any system of computers, so the epistemic
process which lie in the foundation here cannot be simulated by any system of
computers.
Although essentially new arguments behind quantum mechanics are presented
in this book, I still regard conventional Hilbert space based quantum mechanics as
extremely useful when it comes to calculations. It has developed very far since its
beginning in the previous century; see for instance a modern book like Ballentine
(1998). It still has a very vigorous development; see the many articles posted each
month in arXiv:quant-ph or articles published in many good journals. It is not the
purpose of this book to try to change this culture. I only claim that an alternative
and perhaps more intuitive basis can be found.
In the same way, the statistical culture, as it is described in Chap. 2, has a vigorous
development today. What I try to point out, is, that these two cultures may be seen
to have a common basis in the concept of an epistemic process. Nevertheless, I am
quite sure that neither quantum mechanics as a science nor mathematical statistics
as a science nor applied statistics as a tool in many empirical sciences would have
developed as far as they have if some sort of a synthesis between the two cultures had
been taken place from the beginning. This may be linked to the quantum mechanical
concept of complementarity. Universality and creativity may in some sense be seen
as complementary qualities.
The concept of complementarity is extremely important in this book. Up to now
it has mainly been connected to the process of obtaining knowledge, that is, the
epistemic process. As just seen, it can also be associated with human abilities.
Humans observe, make decisions, and act. The complementarity concept can also
be connected to the decisions and the actions. Assume for instance that a student
is to work on some given assignment. He can have his focus on satisfying teacher
A or on satisfying teacher B in the decisions and actions he make when working
on the assignment. These can be complementary foci. The complementarity can be
reduced if more time and concentration is devoted to the assignment.
There are other, complementary, approaches to quantum mechanics than the
one through epistemic processes. Some of these were mentioned in Sect. 4.1.
Of particular interest are the approaches by Hardy (2001, 2011, 2012b, 2013).
In a series of papers, (Wetterich, 2008a,b, 2009, 2010a,b,c,d) has explored the
relationship between classical statistical ensembles and quantum mechanics.
Also for mathematical statistics there are other, complementary, approaches, for
instance through ordinary decision theory.

7.1
General Philosophical Considerations
195
Going back to the epistemic process situation, the basic feature of the approach
in Chap. 4 was focusing: Ask a selected focused question to nature and obtain a
speciﬁc answer. Let this question be based on a maximally accessible variable,
and assume the relevant observer (or group of observers) has at least one other
maximally accessible variable in his mind (in their minds). From the point of view of
a given observer or group of observers, this deﬁnes a state of nature. The remaining
assumptions on the group actions introduced there are mainly to make the derivation
of the ordinary Hilbert space apparatus under some technical conditions possible.
The focusing used in this mathematical development was precise and formal.
Informally, focusing is very often necessary in our daily life when we want to obtain
knowledge before making decisions and acting from these decisions. We simply do
not have the capacity to absorb all the knowledge from all the sources that we are
confronted with.
An epistemic process as used in this book is a very wide concept. As stated
earlier, every epistemic process involves decisions, a decision to ask a question and a
decision to accept the answer. It is interesting to note that also the other assumptions
made in this book have informal analogues for humans making decisions.
1. The rational epistemic setting and the arguing leading to the Born formula
was derived from assuming: (a) The perfectly rational actor D. When making
decisions, most humans will have ideals which they look up to, ideals to the
effect of being as rational as they are able to be. (b) The focused likelihood
principle. When making decisions, most humans will try to use all relevant
available data and if possible also use their prior model for the situation. These
are the important elements which they rely upon. (c) The assumption that the
e-variable in focus is maximally accessible. In certain situations our decision
variable is so comprehensive that it is impossible to extend it.
2. The Schrödinger equation was discussed in detail only for the case of a one-
dimensional position, but it was stated that it can be generalized. The assumptions
made in this derivation were related to an inaccessible stochastic processes where
the observers were able to condition both on the past events and on the future
events for accessible focusings from this process. This has an analogue the
situation a human is in before and after his actions when planning what decisions
to do next. He then takes into account both past events and possible future events.
Thus if we stretch our imagination a little, the two time developments of the
quantum state, which have caused so much discussion in the physical literature, can
both be said to be connected to mechanisms related to the decision making processes
of an observer.
It may also be interesting to speculate around the fact that something called the
free will theorem follows from the assumptions of quantum mechanics, admittedly
in a special case, but it is possible that it is valid for most situations that are
complicated enough. Humans are governed by their free will, and they are constantly
confronted with other humans that are governed by their free will.
So what should one mean about the question of reality? It is obvious that the
moon is there when nobody looks. (See the title of Mermin (1985)). In general any

196
7
Macroscopic Consequences
physical system has an existence which is independent of all observers, and it exists
even when there is no observer at all. It is the state of the system which we in
practice have limited ability to obtain information of.
All these speculations, and indeed the whole idea of a purely epistemic founda-
tion of quantum mechanics, make one a little uneasy, however. The universe was
created 13.8 billion years ago, and physical laws, including quantum mechanics
have presumably been valid since then. How can then everything be so tightly
connected to the human observer? This is of course an obvious question; I
nevertheless thank Bill Wootters, oral communication, for mentioning this point to
me.
A possible solution in the spirit of this book is connected to the imagined
perfectly rational actor D of Sect. 5.4. To go into more detail on the question on
what this element stands for, is again mere speculation, but at least all assumptions
made up to now are consistent with the following world view, which also provides
a link to the ontic interpretation of quantum mechanics. A similar proposal was in
due time made by the philosopher George Berkeley in order to avoid accusations
of solipsism. (Bent Selchau, personal communication.) Now I, from a philosophical
point of view rely on a form of solipsism, namely Zwirn’s convivial solipsism, so
this aspect of my motivation may be said to be somewhat weakened.
But for several reasons I have chosen to believe that there is a Creator of the
universe, who during the creation also observed it. Then later this Creator is at each
time able to observe, make decisions, and act. He is perfectly rational.
The divine Creator may be called God. He is worshiped in different ways in
different cultures and He is seen in different ways by different humans. This can be
explained by the fact that we humans only can have an imperfect image of God. It
is also connected to the fact that we all have different contexts, also when making
deep decisions. The concept of a context has played an important role in this book,
it is important in any epistemic process and it is important for any process of making
decisions.
In very complex situations, the quantum mechanical total state vector may in
some sense be seen as the state vector associated with God; we humans can,
according to Everett and Zwirn (see below) only perceive a relative state vector.
From this perspective, translated to a macroscopic context, the ultimate actor God
must in some way be the same across all cultures, and He must be acting over and
above what particular image each single person might have of Him or of aspects of
Him.
At the outset we know little about the goals behind the decisions made by God.
My own conviction is related on Albert Einstein’s saying: The Lord is subtle, but
not malicious. It is also based upon the God who ends the play Brand of Henrik
Ibsen: Deus caritatis; the God of love. Thus there seems in my opinion to be a God
which is good and wants the best for us humans. But in a world where we all have
our free will, God is confronted with many complementary goals. On the one hand
He is almighty. On the other hand He seems to meet logical impossibilities if He
should do the immediately best for absolutely all of us.

By these speculations I have been entering the realm of theology, which is not
my speciality. However, one can never stop wondering about the large and difﬁcult
questions. Some of the answers must remain open at this stage.
Thus I value high very many aspects of religion. However, I have great difﬁculties
with the attitude: “We in our religious community are right. The others are wrong.”
I am strongly against any kind of fundamentalism. Extreme Muslims may
become terrorists in the belief that they have the right religion. Israeli settlers occupy
Palestinian land in the belief that they have the right religion. It is important to have
an open mind towards the beliefs of other people, but such an open mind should also
have its limitation. There are no simple solutions to the deep conﬂicts in this world.
In the same way as I believe that there exists an ultimate God, I also believe that
there in some sense is an ultimate science. It is very fruitful to do science in various
scientiﬁc cultures, but there must be a logical way to understand the conclusions
obtained in different cultures in a uniﬁed way. This is a personal conviction behind
the work of this book, but the view may perhaps be generalized to other human
activities.
At this point, it is natural to stress that also science has its limitations. Science
is not able to explain consciousness. Science is not able to grasp in any way the
spiritual power behind a symphony by Ludvig von Beethoven, a painting of Pablo
Picasso, the ﬁnding of theorems by Nils Henrik Abel, or the ﬁnding of theories by
Richard Feynman.
We all have a mind which cannot be scrutinized in detail by any scientiﬁc
investigation, however far our knowledge of the brain is developed. Thus there is
a room for a dimension in life that goes beyond science, in my view, also a room for
religion. A further discussion of my views on science and religion can be found in
Helland (2017). The essence of that article stands ﬁrmly, but regarding details, my
views have also developed somewhat during the past 3–4 years.
7.2
A Little More on Convivial Solipsism
The philosophy of convivial solipsism in the context of quantum measurements is
discussed in detail in Zwirn (2016, 2020), and also in Chaps. 1 and 4 in this book.
A brief recapitulation will be given here.
In general, solipsism is a philosophy with many variants. It is based upon the view
that everything that we can know for sure by our mind is connected to this mind.
My mind is an autonomous separate world. The convivial variant also recognizes
that other people have their minds and thus have sure statements connected to their
minds. And communication between different people is possible. In my view, people
that have communicated and agree on certain questions may be seen as a new unit,
a new world, with respect to these questions.
In the microscopic setting deﬁned by the EPR experiment and the Bell exper-
iment, one can look upon Alice and Bob from the point of view of convivial
solipsism. For each observer Zwirn’s convivial solipsism is built upon two assump-

198
7
Macroscopic Consequences
tions: (1) The quantum states that are meaningful to the observer are relative, not
absolute. This assumption goes back to the writings of Everett (1957), and can
also be found in the QBism interpretation (Fuchs, 2010) and in Rovelli’s relational
quantum mechanics (Rovelli, 1996). (2) There is no measurement until the result of
the measurement is perceived in the consciousness of an observer, and for this result
there is a hanging-on mechanism: All subsequent decisions must be seen from the
basis of this result.
In a macroscopic context, convivial solipsism can be coupled to a theory
of decisions, also discussed in the next section. Decisions can be made by a
single actor, or they can be made by groups of actors, after there has been some
communication between them. Thus communication is important. In this book,
communication is seen upon as based on conceptual variables, variables which
may have their origin in a single mind, or is the combined minds of several,
communicating people. In Chap. 4, these variables, and symmetry groups deﬁned on
them, are the points of departure for a logical development ending with something
that seems to be identical to the formalism of quantum theory.
Thus Zwirn’s version of convivial solipsism is based upon the quantum for-
malism; my version is based upon conceptual variables. In my opinion, these
variables occupy a large place in the minds of people, and in the combined minds
of communicating groups of people. Having said that, however, I agree with the
assumptions (1) and (2) above made by Hervé Zwirn. Concerning the measurement
as received by the mind of an observer, and then conserved with respect to future
measurements, I look upon this in many cases as a result of some statistical
inference.
7.3
Quantum Mechanics, Decisions, and Complementarity
The modern technological development would have been impossible without
scientiﬁc theories. In a certain sense, physics lies behind all natural science, and
it is impossible to discuss modern physics without touching quantum mechanics in
some way or other.
The great American physicist Richard Feynman said once: “If somebody claims
that he understands quantum mechanics, he lies.” This statement is still valid, but
during the recent years new elements of understanding have appeared.
To recapitulate, quantum mechanics is a fundamental physical theory that was
developed in the beginning of the twentieth century to explain a range of phenomena
in the microworld. This development is connected to important names like Bohr,
Planck, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and von Neumann.
One crucial point is that quantum mechanics is a formalism, a set of calculating
rules for how one can predict the outcome of experiments. These calculating rules
have had an large success; they have been used for everything from small elementary
particles to complex chemical and biological systems, and in almost every case

7.3
Quantum Mechanics, Decisions, and Complementarity
199
where this has been tested, the predictions have been 100% in agreement with the
results of experiments.
However, the great question is how one shall interpret these calculating rules.
Here physicists disagree strongly, also today. During the recent years there has
been held a long range of international conferences on the foundation of quantum
mechanics. A great number of interpretations have been proposed; some of them
look very peculiar to the laymen. For instance, during one period it was popular to
assume that there exist millions or billions of parallel worlds, and that a new word
appears every time when one performs a measurement. Some take this point of view
even today.
On two of these conferences recently there was taken opinion polls among the
participants. It turned out to be an astonishing disagreement on many fundamental
and fairly simple questions. One of these questions was: Is the quantum mechanics
a description of the objective world, or is it only a description of our knowledge
about reality? The ﬁrst of these descriptions is called ontological, the second
epistemic. (From Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary: epistemic—what concerns or
comes from knowledge, or the conditions for obtaining knowledge.) A similar, but
not identical distinction is realistic versus non-realistic. Up to now most physicists
have supported the ontological or realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, but
versions of the epistemic interpretation have received a fresh impetus during the
recent years.
I look upon the present book as a contribution to this debate. An epistemic
process can denote any process to achieve knowledge. It can be a statistical
investigation or a quantum mechanical measurement, but it can also be a simpler
process. The book has a very informal interpretation of quantum states, which in the
traditional theory has a very abstract deﬁnition: A quantum state seems under wide
circumstances to have a connection to a focused question and a sharp answer to this
question.
As discussed before, a related interpretation is QBism, or quantum Bayesianism,
see Fuchs (2010) and von Baeyer (2016). The predictions of quantum mechanics
involve probabilities, and a QBist interpret these as purely subjective probabilities,
attached to a concrete observer. Many elements in QBism represent something
completely new in relation to classical physical theory, in relation to many people’s
conception about science in general and also to earlier interpretations of quantum
mechanics. The essential thing is that the observer plays a role that cannot be
eliminated. The single person’s comprehension of reality can differ from person
to person, at least at a given point of time, and this is in principle all that can be said.
Such an understanding can in my opinion be made valid for very many aspects
of reality. We humans can have a tendency to experience reality differently. Partly,
this can be explained by the fact that we give different meaning to the concepts we
use. Or we can have different contexts for our choices. An important aspect is that
we focus differently.
This statement, that certain aspects of reality may be said to partly depend on
the choice of focus by an observer (or a group of communicating observers), and

200
7
Macroscopic Consequences
the implications that this may have on the foundation of quantum mechanics, I have
tried to give a precise background for in this book.
This theory, as I see it, can be expressed through what I call conceptual variables,
variables deﬁned by a person or by a group of communicating persons. The variables
can be simple physical variables like energy, position, velocity, or spin. Such
variables can be accessible, that is, it is possible to ﬁnd values for them, for instance
by doing experiments. But some variables are so extensive that it is impossible to
ﬁnd values for them. In a physical situation, this can be a vector (position, velocity)
for a particle. According to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, it is impossible at the
same time to determine position and velocity.
In a decision situation, the decision variable may be so extensive that it can be
impossible for the person in question to make a concrete decision. Such variables
are called inaccessible. In a given situation, we can have a fundamental inaccessible
variable, and we have the choice between focusing on different accessible (math-
ematical) functions of this variable. In the physical situation that I sketched, the
observer can focus on position or velocity. In a decision situation, the person can
focus on a simpler decision variable, in such a way that it is possible to make a
partial decision.
By using group theory and group representation theory, I am able to study such a
situation mathematically, and it seems to appear that an essential part of the quantum
formulation can be derived under very weak conditions.
My opinion is that what we can develop from such results can be crucial for our
views on the world around us. Empirically, the quantum formalism has turned out
to give a very extensive description of what we know about our world, in physical
situations in microcosm a nearly all-embracing description; in decision situations it
has also been fruitful to look at a quantum description, see below.
These investigations support the hypothesis that the quantum states are in
correspondence with focused questions to nature together with sharp answers to
these questions. It is often clarifying to have an epistemic way to relate to the world;
it can be useful to seek knowledge. And we can get knowledge on certain issues by
focusing on certain questions to the world around us, say nature, and our knowledge
depends on the answers we obtain to these questions. And this is all we can achieve.
Following such an opinion, it can be argued that for certain phenomena there
exists no other reality than this (subjective) attached to each single person. This
statement must be made precise to be understood in the correct way. First, it is
connected to an ideal observer. Secondly, groups of observers that communicate
between each other can go in and act as one observer when a concrete measurement
is focused on. When all potential observers agree on the answer to a measurement,
this measurement must represent an objective property of reality. Thus the objective
world exists; it is the state attached to certain aspects of the world that in certain
cases must be connected to an observer (or to several communicating observers).
Nevertheless, these are aspects of physics—and science—which can be surpris-
ing for many people, but in my opinion such viewpoints may be necessary, not only
in physics, but also in many other areas of life.

7.3
Quantum Mechanics, Decisions, and Complementarity
201
In fact, this can in my view be made valid for very many aspects of reality. We
humans have a tendency to experience reality differently. This can be due to the
fact that we give different meanings to the concepts we use. Or we have different
contexts for our valuations. An important aspect is that we focus differently.
One remark concerning the concrete QBism, which can be said to represent a
variant of this view, deserves to be repeated here: Subjective Bayes-probabilities
have also been in fashion among groups of statisticians. Personally, I mean that
it can be very fruitful to look for analogies between statistical inference theory
and quantum mechanics, but then one must look more broadly upon statistics and
statistical inference theory, not only focus on subjective Bayesianism. This is only
one of several philosophies that can form a basis for statistics as a science. Studying
eventual connections between these philosophical views is an active research area
today.
The Born rule, that gives the probabilities in quantum mechanics, is in my
book derived from three assumptions: (1) a focused version of the statistician’s
likelihood principle; (2) an assumption about rationality, expressed by a Dutch
book argument; (3) the assumption that the initial state is connected to a maximally
accessible variable, that is, one that is not a function of another, more extensive
accessible variable. In (2) I do not assume that the experimentalist himself is
perfectly rational. We can all do mistakes. I only assume that the experimentalist,
when making his decisions, has certain ideals, and that these ideals can be modeled
by something perfectly rational, that he looks up to. For the experimentalist, it is
important that there exists a correspondence between the decisions that he makes
as a result of the experiment and the actions which follow these decisions, where
he at least changes his knowledge basis, and he may also change certain aspects of
the physical context. The conclusion is that an experimentalist that acts in this way
after the decisions which result from the experiment will get probabilities for a new
maximally accessible variable determined by the Born rule, given that he knows the
value of an earlier, maximally accessible variable.
This view is related to, but not identical to, the QBists’ view of the Born rule;
they regard it as a “moral rule.”
This section is also about focusing on human decisions in general, simple
decisions, more complicated decisions, and even deeper decisions that can concern
philosophical questions. We all go through life and take decision after decision,
make choice after choice.
It can be of some interest to discuss how ideas from modern physics can
illuminate these processes. It must be emphasized that this is an account of my own
opinions, which are far from shared by all physicists. However, Niels Bohr, nearly
hundred years ago, expressed similar thoughts, admittedly not quite as radical as
this.
My own view upon quantum mechanics is based on a fundamental theory for
epistemic processes, processes with the purpose of obtaining knowledge about
something. In my opinion, a theory of such processes could play a role both for our
understanding of daily life and for our understanding of science, quantum mechanics
in particular.

Macroscopic Consequences
Epistemic processes, at least the simplest of them, involve decisions in two
stages: First a decision to choose a focus. Then, if necessary, there is a collection
of data. Finally there is an informed decision about what these data say about
the phenomenon that we have focused upon. Traditional decision theory is only
concerned with the last one of these decisions.
It is very important to ﬁnd a good enough theory of human decisions. The domi-
nating decision theory used by scientiﬁc communities today, is a far developed—but
in its basis relatively simple—theory for decisions under uncertainty. This covers
much of economic theory and also statistical inference theory, and is thus an
important part of the foundation both of economy as a science and of statistics as a
science.
But human decisions are very complex. Firstly, the decisions may depend on
the order in which we want to do our decisions; more generally most decisions
will depend on a context, partly determined by earlier decisions. Secondly, many
decisions may be a result of a complicated interaction between the conscious and
the subconscious. This is not covered by traditional decision theory.
During the recent 5–6 years, there has been proposed and developed a new formal
decision theory, where the decisions are in part conscious and in part subconscious.
This decision theory is inspired by quantum mechanics (Yukalov and Sornette,
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014). There has also in recent years appeared aspects
of the sciences economy and psychology that are analogous to certain aspects of
basic quantum mechanics. (See among others Khrennikov (2010) and Busemeyer
and Bruza (2012)). Much of this can be coupled to decisions.
Decisions can be based on knowledge, on beliefs, or both. Subjective belief is
not enough.
In science decisions are made within scientiﬁc societies, often international.
There is also a need to think across scientiﬁc disciplines. But it can be difﬁcult to go
into depth here, and at the same time keep a breadth that even go across disciplines.
Decisions can be made by single persons or by groups of people. A group of
people can agree to go collectively into a decision process, and can make collective
decisions on which actions should be done after the process is ﬁnished. All decisions
and all actions—whether done on a single person level or on a group level, should to
the best of one’s ability be done in an intelligent way, where one takes into account
all accessible knowledge. For many decisions, this may take time.
But in certain cases, we do not have so much time for our decisions. This is
true for most practical decisions taken in everyday life. An important example taken
from daily life is that of driving a car. Here one must take quick decisions and at
every point of time focus on other car drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, trafﬁc signs,
etc. To be able to do this, concentration is important, but it is also important to have
good training. Other cases where we have to take a series of fast decisions are in
verbal communication with other people.
Kahneman (2011) has given an extensive account of the relationship between
fast and slow decisions. Through many examples he argues that our minds are
decomposed into two systems: System 1, where we take the rapid decisions
necessary to survive as human beings, and System 2, which is coupled in only

7.3
Quantum Mechanics, Decisions, and Complementarity
203
through extra efforts, but which gives us, in a more slow way, the possibility in
certain cases to make more correct decisions.
All decisions are made in a context. This context may be purely physical, but it
can also be historically determined or be tied to the personality of the one who takes
the decision. If it is a question of a conscious decision, it can be critical to know
what concept the person has at his disposal in order to formulate his thoughts.
Our opinions can depend on our background, what we have experienced earlier,
and what persons we have been communicating with or have been inﬂuenced by.
But at the same time, we have free will to take decisions, in particular to formulate
our viewpoints and opinions.
In discussing these and similar questions, it can be useful to look at a concept
from modern physics, namely the quantum mechanical concept complementarity.
For a thorough discussion of complementarity in physics, see Plotnitsky (2013).
The concept was originally introduced by Niels Bohr to describe what it is possible
to measure physically, but in various talks Bohr also looked upon extensions of the
complementarity concept. Such extensions are also of great current interest.
First look upon the purely physical aspect. It turns out that in principle it
is impossible to simultaneously measure the velocity and position of a particle.
Velocity and position are complementary quantities. It turns also out that this
problem is less for particles with large mass, i.e., heavy particles. Thus the degree
of complementarity is largest for light particles. Concretely this is expressed in
Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation: The product of the uncertainty in velocity and the
uncertainty in position is greater or equal to Planck’s constant divided by the mass
of the particle. If we try to measure the position accurately, we disturb the system
so much that it is impossible to measure the velocity accurately. And similarly we
cannot address position if we try to measure the velocity accurately.
The terms complementary and complementarity have several meanings, both in
physics and elsewhere. In this book, I let these concepts refer to two or more aspects
of reality which are difﬁcult or impossible to grasp or to have an attitude to at the
same time, but where both (all) in some way are needed to get a complete picture of
reality. Two maximally accessible conceptual variables are complementary.
In this way the accurate measurement of velocity and the accurate measurement
of position are complementary activities, and the corresponding quantities are also
complementary. Many physicists are skeptical to using these concepts outside the
concrete physical context, but we will see that it can be fruitful.
Here is Plotnitsky’s deﬁnition of complementarity: (a) A mutual exclusivity of
certain phenomena, entities, or conceptions; and yet (b) The possibility of applying
each one of them separately at any given point; and (c) The necessity of using all of
them at different moments for a comprehensive account of the totality of phenomena
that we consider.
This deﬁnition points at the physical situation discussed above, and has Niels
Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mechanics as a point of departure. However, in
my opinion the deﬁnition can also be carried over to a long range of macroscopic
phenomena or conceptions.

204

Macroscopic Consequences
A simple example: A student works with a difﬁcult assignment. One goal can be
to get it ﬁnished fast; another goal can be to hand in an answer to the assignment
which is as good as possible. These are clearly complementary goals. If his ability to
concentrate is good, this may to some extent reduce the degree of complementarity.
Opinions and viewpoints of different persons may often be complementary.
Examples of this can be seen daily in newspaper debates. But the differences in
opinions may go deeper, and have their basis in complementary worldviews.
The complementarity concept has thus more aspects than those connected to
epistemic processes. In general one might say that it is connected to limitations
in certain situations. We cannot reach all goals at once. We cannot, as humans, have
many viewpoints on certain issue at the same time. However, it is permitted to be
uncertain. In the quantum language, the pure states corresponds to a person that is
certain on a speciﬁc issue, if this issue can be determined in terms of a maximally
accessible conceptual variable. Persons that are uncertain on the actual questions,
can be described by mixed states.
Good authors can write novels where the reader understands each single per-
son’s descriptions of reality, even in cases where these descriptions are not fully
compatible. In such cases, one can of course discuss if there is an objective reality
behind these separate descriptions. It may be that the author’s point is just that it
is not very fruitful to look for such a complicated objective reality. In any case, to
ﬁnd such an objective reality, one may have to go beyond the conceptual basis for
each single person. This is similar in many political conﬂicts, where the schism is
between groups of people.
In quantum mechanics, the concept of reality has played a prominent role in
recent discussions. In QBism, the emphasis is moved to each person’s experience
of reality. In this article, I want to go one step further and talk about the collective
experience of each group of communicating persons. For different persons or for
different groups of communicating persons, their perceptions of reality may be
complementary. This may be true when observing the microworld.
Many physics papers discuss two actors Alice and Bob, being so far away from
each other that they do not communicate. All physicists agree that there exist
situations where the observations of Alice and Bob are entangled. From an epistemic
point of view, the two actors may also have complementary comprehensions of the
world because they focus differently. According to the physicist John A. Wheeler,
each observer can create his/her own history.
I claim that this may be equally true for persons—or groups of persons—
making experiences in the macroworld. People may tend to have different—
complementary—worldviews.
The summer 2014, in the middle of the Gaza war, both the Israeli and the
Palestinian ambassador to Norway were interviewed in a major Norwegian news-
paper about the situation in the Middle East. The two had clearly complementary
worldviews.
The Israeli ambassador talked about safety for his population and about Hamas
using human shields for their launching of rockets. He also referred to holocaust
and stressed that the Jews had strong reasons for seeking their own land. He also

7.3
Quantum Mechanics, Decisions, and Complementarity
205
mentioned that Hamas had broken several cease-ﬁre agreements, and emphasized
that Hamas would not recognize Israel as a sovereign state.
The Palestinian ambassador described the long occupation of the West Bank and
the brutal attacks on the Gaza stripe. He emphasized strongly all the humiliations
that the Palestinians are and have been met with. He mentioned illegal Israeli
settlements and apartheid-like states in Israel. Of course he also talked about the
many civilian losses during the war, especially losses of children.
We, while hearing all this, can of course form our own opinions. My own
opinions in this question are strongly inﬂuenced by what happened during the
celebration of the 70 years anniversary for the establishment of the state of Israel at
the 14 of May 2018. In agreement with the Norwegian foreign minister I can in no
way accept the shooting with sharp ammunition against unarmed demonstrators.
But—in general—to what extent are our opinions dependent upon which infor-
mation we by chance have obtained, and not least, upon which group we belong
to?
It is a fact that Danes largely have been more Israel-friendly than Norwegians.
Denmark would not sign a common Nordic resolution about the Gaza war, but chose
instead a more watered down EU-resolution.
Without doubt, our opinions on many questions can be inﬂuences by which
country we happen to live in, by which period of time we live in, and more generally,
by which culture we belong to.
Sometimes, in such situations, it can be useful to step back and just say that
the two worldviews are complementary. This can be linked to trying to respect both
parties, something which is important if one should happen to be in a position where
one can help in peace negotiations.
Nevertheless, to only be neutral and rest on the complementarity concept can be
dangerous. As humans we have both the right and the duty to take a deﬁnite stand on
various questions. This is the great logical dilemma that we are faced with in every
situation: To make a conscious decision while we at the same time know that we
ourselves are guided by unknown subconscious causes. In reality this is a problem
in every case where we shall make a difﬁcult decision. However, for many people
this dilemma is not a big problem: One makes decisions on an intuitive basis.
The complementarity concept must not make us into value-relativists. There is
something right and wrong in this world. All civilized humans should dissociate
themselves from the past brutal behavior of the leaders of the Islamic State, but one
should also condemn the terrible bombing of civilians in Syria by Assad and the
Russians. During the last world war it was right to dissociate oneself from Hitler and
his fellows, and we must deﬁnitely dissociate ourselves from the human cleansings
of Stalin and Pol Pot. In no way we should accept the treatment of the Rohingya
people in Myanmar. In general we should dissociate ourselves from everybody who
do not respect fundamental human rights, and there are also other moral issues
where we can say something of absolute validity.
To take a concrete and very actual problem: What should we mean about the
European refugee issue? From an ideal point of view our borders should perhaps be
more open, when seeing all the suffering among the refugees. But at the same time,

206
7
Macroscopic Consequences
there is a limitation on how many refugees the various countries have a capacity to
receive in a decent way. This is an area where the public debate has been hard
recently. To a certain extent, the debate has been dominated by complementary
points of view. This should not prevent us from making up our own opinions.
Politics is not simple, and it should not be simple. Many people in Western coun-
tries were unambiguously enthusiastic when the Arabic spring started, overthrowing
regime after regime. But unfortunately, the spring has turned into winter in many of
the affected countries.
Both in our daily decisions, in politics, and in science, it can be necessary to
focus. Another essential point is that all decisions are made in a context. Finally,
one should be able to communicate verbally our conscious decisions.
Focusing can be done at all stages of the decision process. As complementary
goals, complementary activities, and complementary world views are concerned, it
can be a solution to focus upon one of the goals, one of the activities, and even one
of the world views. But in particular in the last case, a more intelligent and creative
solution can be to try to ﬁnd a partial synthesis.
Look again on the Middle East conﬂict, and the two ambassadors who had
complementary worldviews. For many westerners it has been important to take a
clear and unambiguous standpoint for one or the other party in this conﬂict. But as a
sensible person has said: This is not a soccer game. There are serious issues at stake
for both parties. A more constructive question can be: What can reduce the degree
of complementarity? What obstacles get in our way for at the end to reach a lasting
two state solution? Or for other lasting solutions?
In this way, concepts from our understanding of modern physics can contribute
to enlightening difﬁcult problems, both concerning our own decisions, decisions by
groups of people, and the views lying behind serious conﬂicts. One hope should be
that a correct understanding of science might create a conceptual apparatus giving
both scientists, politicians, and others in leading positions inspiration to work for
good human purposes, in its ﬁnal consequence to work for peace here on earth.
A clear view on interpretations of modern physics, and extensions of such
interpretations to other areas, can in my opinion contribute to making such a
conceptual apparatus. Of course, this does not mean that this contribution from
modern physics is a unique contribution for peace. Many good people in our
societies work for a similar ﬁnal goal. One point with this section has been to explain
how such a work can be motivated completely rationally—with basis in a possible
interpretation of the most rational of all sciences: Fundamental physical theory.

Proof That the Generalized Likelihood
Principle Follows from the GWCP
and the GWSP (Birnbaum’s Theorem):
The Discrete Case
Let E1 and E2 be the two experiments in the generalized likelihood principle, and
let E∗be the mixed experiment from the GWCP. On the sample space of E∗deﬁne
the statistic
t(j, zj) =
 (1, z∗
1) if j = 1 and z1 = z∗
1 or if j = 2 and z2 = z∗
2
(j, zj) otherwise
.
I will use the factorization theorem to prove that t(j, zj) is a sufﬁcient statistic in
the mixed experiment E∗. Deﬁne
h(j, zj|τ) =
 c if (j, zj) = (2, z∗
2)
1 otherwise
,
where c is the constant of proportionality between the two likelihoods. Deﬁne for
both values of j and for all zj:
g(t|θ, τ) = g((j, zj)|θ, τ) = f ∗((j, zj)|θ, τ),
where f ∗is the point probability in E∗.
Now for all sample points except (2, z∗
2) (but including (1, z∗
1)), we have
t(j, zj) = (j, zj), so
g(t(j, zj)|θ, τ)h(j, zj|τ) = g((j, zj)|θ, τ) · 1 = f ∗((j, zj)|θ, τ).

A
Proof That the Generalized Likelihood Principle Follows from the GWCP. . .
Such a factorization also holds for (2, z∗
2). Namely, by using the deﬁnitions of
t, h, g, f ∗together with the GWCP, we have
g(t(2, z∗
2)|θ, τ)h(2, z∗
2|τ) = g((1, z∗
1)|θ, τ)c = f ∗((1, z∗
1)|θ, τ)c = c1
2f1(z∗
1|θ, τ)
= c1
2L1(θ|z∗
1, τ) = 1
2L2(θ|z∗
2, τ) = 1
2f2(z∗
2|θ, τ) = f ∗((2, z∗
2)|θ, τ).
Here L1 and L2 are the likelihoods of the two experiments E1 and E2, and I have
used the premise of the generalized likelihood principle.
Thus by the factorization theorem, t(j, zj) is a sufﬁcient statistic for θ, and by
the GWSP we have that the evidence about θ in E∗given by (1, z∗
1) and (2, z∗
2) is
the same. By the GWCP, (1, z∗
1) gives the same evidence as z∗
1 in E1 and (2, z∗
2)
gives the same evidence as z∗
2 in E2. Hence these latter evidences must also be the
same, and the generalized likelihood principle follows.

Some Group Theory, Operator Theory,
and Group Representation Theory
A group G is deﬁned in mathematics as a set of elements g with a composition g1g2
satisfying the axioms: (1) There is a unit e such that eg = ge = g for all g; (2) For
each g there is an inverse g−1 such that g−1g = gg−1 = e; (3) The composition is
associative: (g1g2)g3 = g1(g2g3) for all g1, g2, g3.
The group is Abelian (commutative) if g1g2 = g2g1 for all g1, g2.
Important examples of groups are the additive group on the real numbers and the
multiplicative group on the positive real numbers.
For a ﬁnite group G, each element g ∈G has an order m such that gm = e. A
cyclic subgroup is the group with elements {e, g, g2, . . . , gm−1}. In general a group
G may have several subgroups G′ ⊆G.
Most of the groups used in this chapter are group actions, that is, transformation
groups on some set  , even though some must be seen as abstract groups. A
transformation g of  is any function on the elements φ ∈ , which is one-to-one
and onto. These functions can be composed by (g1g2)(φ) = g1(g2(φ)), and they
have inverses g−1. The existence of a unit and the associative law are automatic.
Thus by deﬁnition they form a group. For any set  the group of all transformations
on  exists and is called the automorphism group of  . Thus many groups G of this
chapter may be considered as subgroups of some automorphism group.
An orbit of a transformation group G is a subset of  , the set of all φ that are
transformed from a single element φ0, that is {φ : φ = gφ0 for some g ∈G}. The
restriction of G to an orbit or to a set of orbits will itself be a group transformation,
which again without possible confusion can be called G. Restrictions to orbits of
groups on the parameter space were used in connection with model reduction in
Sect. 2.2 and later. This constraint on model reduction is important if the same
transformation group shall be kept during the reduction. Such reductions were
important in connection to the maximal symmetrical epistemic setting used in
introducing the quantum mechanical perspective.
A group where the only orbit is the full group is said to be transitive. For a
transitive group, each element of  can be transformed to each other element by
some group action.

Some Group Theory, Operator Theory, and Group Representation Theory
The isotropy group of an element φ0 ∈ is the subgroup H of G such that
h(φ0) = φ0 for h ∈H. If φ1 = gφ0, then H(φ1) = gH(φ0)g−1. For some groups
the isotropy group is trivial.
Let in general both the set  and the group G be given some topology; both
spaces assumed to be locally compact. Then one can under quite general conditions
(see Helland (2010) or any mathematical text on this) deﬁne in a unique way
(except for a multiplicative constant) two positive measures, a left Haar measure μG
satisfying μG(gD) = μG(D) and a right Haar measure νG satisfying νG(Dg) =
νG(D) for all g ∈G and all Borel sets D ⊆G.
Then turn to invariant measures on the set  itself. In mathematical texts,  
is often itself treated as a group, and then the concepts of Haar measures carry
over. But this is not satisfactory for all statistical applications. In Helland (2010,
Subsection 3.3 and Appendix A.2.2) a summary of a way to ﬁx this is given. In that
book, group actions were written to the right: φ →φg so that φ(g1g2) = (φg1)g2.
This is uncommon but has a certain logical advantage: In the product g1g2, we get
that g1 is applied ﬁrst and then g2.
A left invariant measure on  is then any measure μ satisfying μ(g(B)) = μ(B)
for any g ∈G and for any Borel set B ⊆ , while a right invariant measure is any
measure ν satisfying ν(Bg) = ν(B) for all g, B. In Helland (2010, Theorem A1)
it was proved that a right invariant measure always exists on a given orbit of G if
the stabilizer of one element, hence of all elements, of this orbit is compact. This is
the case under weak technical assumptions (Wijsman, 1990, proper group actions;
see) if G is locally compact. In Helland (2010, Subsection 3.3) a list of arguments
were given why the right invariant measure should be used as an objective prior in
statistics if such a prior is required.
The invariant measure is unique up to a multiplicative scalar if the group action
is transitive; otherwise, invariant measures can be introduced independently on each
orbit. For compact groups and in many other cases the left invariant measure and the
right invariant measure can be taken as identical. When  is compact, the invariant
measure can be taken as normalized: ν( ) = 1.
Two groups G and R are homomorphic if there exists a function T from G to R
such that T (g1g2) = T (g1)T (g2) for all g1, g2 and such that T (e) = e′, the unit in
R. Then also T (g−1) = T (g)−1. They are isomorphic if T is one-to-one. Then they
may be considered as the same abstract group.
Next let us introduce some basic algebra. A vector space is an Abelian group
under addition where also multiplication by scalars is deﬁned. In this book we
often consider ﬁnite-dimensional complex vector spaces, meaning that the scalars
are complex numbers and that there exists a set of basis vectors ei, i = 1, . . . , k,
that are linearly independent: 
i ciei = 0 implies c1 = . . . = ck = 0. A linear
operator A on a vector space is a function from the vector space into itself satisfying
A(c1a1 + c2a2) = c1Aa1 + c2Aa2.

By relating it to the basis vectors, a linear operator can always be represented by
a square matrix:
Aej =

i
eiD(A)ij .
Then if a = 
j ejaj and b = Aa = 
i eibi, we have bi = 
j D(A)ij aj. Thus if
a is the column vector of components aj and similarly for b, we get b = D(A)a, in
complete analogy to b = Aa.
If a is represented by the column vector a, we deﬁne a† as represented by the
row vector (a∗
1, . . . , a∗
k), where ∗denotes complex conjugate. The scalar product
a†b is deﬁned as 
i a∗
i bi. This scalar product is linear in the second vector and
antilinear in the ﬁrst, in agreement with the tradition in physics. Mathematicians
tend to use a scalar product that is linear in the ﬁrst vector. This is in effect just a
cultural difference, but to outsiders it is annoying.
Two vectors a and b are orthogonal if a†b = 0. With this interpretation, the basis
vectors ei are automatically pairwise orthogonal and have norm ∥ei∥≡

e†
i ei = 1.
In general one can always ﬁnd many sets of n orthogonal basis vectors in an n-
dimensional vector space.
A vector space with the structure above is called an inner product space. This
notion can be generalized to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, having an inﬁnite set of
basis vectors. The norm ∥a∥=
√
a†a induces a metric; hence a topology on this
space by d(a, b) = ∥a −b∥. The space is complete in this metric if ∥an −am∥→
0 (n, m →∞) implies that there exists an a such that ∥an −a∥→0. A complete
inner product space is called a Hilbert space. A closed subspace of a Hilbert space is
again a Hilbert space. A ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space is always complete,
hence a Hilbert space.
The identity operator I is deﬁned by Ia = a, and the multiplication of operators
by (AB)(a) = A(Ba). Then (in the ﬁnite-dimensional case) D(I) is diagonal with
1’s on the diagonal, and D(AB) = D(A)D(B), ordinary matrix multiplication.
An operator A is invertible if there exists an A−1 such that A−1A = AA−1 = I.
A ﬁnite-dimensional operator A is invertible if and only if det(D(A)) ̸= 0; then
D(A−1) = D(A)−1.
The conjugate of an operator A, A†, is deﬁned by a†(Ab) = (A†a)†b. Slightly
different, but equivalent, notations for scalar products and conjugates, using kets and
bras, were used in the main text. An operator A is called Hermitian or self-adjoint
if A† = A. An operator V is called unitary if V −1 = V †.
An eigenvector v and an eigenvalue θ are solutions of Av = θv. An operator
A is Hermitian if and only if all its eigenvalues are real-valued. Eigenvectors
corresponding to different eigenvalues are then automatically orthogonal. In the
k-dimensional Hermitian case there are always sets of k pairwise orthogonal
eigenvectors.

B
Some Group Theory, Operator Theory, and Group Representation Theory
A group representation of G is a continuous homomorphism from G to the group
of invertible linear operators V on some vector space H:
V (g1g2) = V (g1)V (g2).
It is also required that V (e) = I, the identity. This assures that the inverse exists:
V (g)−1 = V (g−1). The representation is unitary if the operators are unitary
(V (g)†V (g) = I). If the vector space is ﬁnite-dimensional, we have a representation
D(V ) on the square, invertible matrices. For any representation V and any ﬁxed
invertible operator K on the vector space, we can deﬁne a new representation by
W(g) = KV (g)K−1. One can prove that two equivalent unitary representations are
unitarily equivalent, so K can be chosen as a unitary operator.
A subspace H1 of H is called invariant with respect to the representation V if
u ∈H1 implies V (g)u ∈H1 for all g ∈G. The null-space {0} and the whole
space H are trivially invariant; other invariant subspaces are called proper. A group
representation V of a group G in H is called irreducible if it has no proper invariant
subspace. A representation is said to be fully reducible if it can be expressed
as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations. A ﬁnite-dimensional unitary
representation of any group is fully reducible. In terms of a matrix representation,
this means that we can always ﬁnd a W(g) = KV (g)K−1 such that D(W) is of
minimal block diagonal form. Each one of these blocks will represent an irreducible
representation. They are all one-dimensional if and only if G is Abelian. The blocks
may be seen as operators on subspaces of the original vector space, the irreducible
subspaces. These are important in studying the structure of the group.
A useful result is Schur’s Lemma (see for instance Barut and Raczka 1985):
Let V1 and V2 be two irreducible representations of a group G; V1 on the space
H1 and V2 on the space H2. Suppose that there is a transformation T from H1 to
H2 such that
V2(g)T (v) = T (V1(g)v)
for all g ∈G and v ∈H1.
Then either T is zero or it is an isomorphism. Furthermore, if H1 = H2, then
T = λI for some complex number λ.
Let ν be the right and left invariant measure of the space  induced by the group
G, assuming the two to be equal, and consider the Hilbert space H = L2( , ν).
Then the right regular representation of G on H is deﬁned by UR(g)f (φ) =
f (φg) and the left regular representation by UL(g)f (φ) = f (g−1φ). These
representations always exist, and they can be shown to be unitary.
If V is an arbitrary representation of a compact group G in H, then there exists
in H a new scalar product deﬁning a norm equivalent to the initial one, relative to
which V is a unitary representation of G.

Helland (2010, Appendix A.2.4).

A generalization of a unitary representation is a projective unitary representation.
The unitary matrices then satisfy
U(g)U(h) = ω(g, h)U(gh),
where the complex multiplier ω satisﬁes
|ω(g, h)| = 1,
ω(g, h)ω(gh, k) = ω(g, hk)ω(h, k),
ω(g, e) = ω(e, g) = 1,
with e being the unit element of the group G. The discussion of Sect. 4.4 can be
generalized to such representations. For a transitive group G let φ = hφ0, and
deﬁne the left regular representation by U(g)f (φ) = ω(g, g−1h)f (g−1φ). This
will provide an arbitrary phase factor for the state vectors.

(C.2)
Here ψ(k−1φ) = (θ(k−1φ), ξ(k−1φ)), and the corresponding ket vector is
constructed such that each |ψ(φ)⟩is in one-to-one correspondence with the ﬁrst
component of ψ(φ), namely θ(φ). Hence, by a change of variable in (C.2), we can
write
Qk(ξ) =

Ωθ
|θ(φ′), ξ(k−1φ)⟩⟨θ(φ′), ξ(k−1φ)|dρ(θ(kφ′)),
(C.3)
where we may in general think of dρ as a marginalization of a measure on Ωφ. Since
this measure is assumed to be left invariant, we may neglect the last k here, and we
ﬁnd Qk(ξ(φ)) = Q(ξ(k−1φ)). This is inserted into (C.1), and using left-invariance
of the measure again, this gives that the operator V (k−1)AξV (k) is associated with
the conceptual variable ξk(φ) = ξ(kφ). Thus Theorem 4.2 generalizes for Aξ. The
proof is similar for Aθ.

b1 = c1 and P1 = Q1.
Then we can subtract the term b1P1 from the lefthand side of (C.4), subtract the

Proof Whatever is meant by experimental evidence, I will assume that it varies
continuously with θ. I then need to show that F(z, τ) for ﬁxed z and τ can be
approximated arbitrarily well by a corresponding discrete expression. To this end,
I need that p(z|τ, θ) is a continuous function of θ and that p(z|τ, θ) →0 when
∥θ∥→∞. Let ϵ > 0 be arbitrary, and ﬁx R such that p(z|τ, θ) < ϵ for ∥θ∥> R.
Fix δ > 0 such that ∥p(z|τ, θ)−p(z|τ, θ′)∥< ϵ when ∥θ−θ′∥< δ and ∥θ∥, ∥θ′∥≤
R. Let B be the ball ∥θ∥≤R, and divide B into a ﬁnite set of subsets Bk such that
∥θ −θ′∥< δ when θ, θ′ ∈Bk. Let uk be some value of θ if θ ∈Ωθ ∩Bk. Deﬁne
a new parameter θ0 by θ0 = θ0(θ) = uk for θ ∈Bk, and deﬁne p0(z|τ, uk) =
p(z|τ, uk). For θ ∈Bc, let θ0 take an arbitrary value, but deﬁne p0(z|τ, θ0) = 0.
Let the ket vector |k⟩in H correspond to the question “What is the value of θ0?”
together with the answer θ0 = uk. These ket vectors span a subspace H 0 of H .
This question is equivalent to the question “What is the value of θ?” together
with the answer “θ ∈Bk.” Thus by Born’s formula, for any |ψ⟩∈H 0 we have
⟨ψ|E(Bk)|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|k⟩⟨k|ψ⟩, which implies that 
k c(uk)E(Bk) can be made
arbitrarily close to 
k c(uk)|k⟩⟨k| for any continuous bounded function c.
Then 
k p0(z|τ, uk)|k⟩⟨k| is arbitrarily close to 
k p(z|τ, uk)E(Bk), which
is arbitrarily close to the corresponding integral. Hence this gives the necessary
discrete approximation.
⊓⊔

Appendix D
Proof of Busch’s Theorem
for the Finite-Dimensional Case
The main point of the proof is to show that any generalized probability measure
on effects extends to a unique positive linear functional on the vector space of all
bounded linear Hermitian operators. This is done in steps:
1. It is trivial that μ(E) = nμ( 1
nE) for all positive integers. It follows that
μ(pE) = pμ(E) for all rational numbers in [0, 1]. By approximating from
below and from above by rational numbers, this implies that μ(αE) = αμ(E)
for all real numbers α in [0, 1].
2. Let A be any positive bounded operator in H. Then there is a positive number
α such that ⟨u|Au⟩≤α for all unit vectors u. Then E deﬁned by E = (1/α)A
is an effect. Thus we can always write A = αE for an effect E. Assume now
that there are two effects E1 and E2 such that A = α1E1 = α2E2. Assume
without loss of generality that α2 > α1 > 0. Then by (1) μ(E2) = α1
α2 μ(E1), so
α1μ(E1) = α2μ(E2). Therefore we can uniquely deﬁne μ(A) = α1μ(E1).
3. Let A and B be positive bounded operators. Take γ > 1 such that 1
γ (A+B) is an
effect. Then we can write μ(A+B) as γ μ( 1
γ (A+B)) = γ μ( 1
γ A)+γ μ( 1
γ B) =
μ(A) + μ(B).
4. Let C be an arbitrary bounded Hermitian operator. Assume that we have two
different decompositions C = A −B = A′ −B′ into a difference of positive
operators. Then A + B′ = A′ + B implies μ(A) + μ(B′) = μ(A′) + μ(B).
Hence, μ(A) −μ(B) = μ(A′) −μ(B′), so we can uniquely deﬁne μ(C) as
μ(A) −μ(B). It follows then easily from (3) that μ(C + D) = μ(C) + μ(D)
for bounded Hermitian operators.
5. This is extended directly to μ(C1 + . . . + Cr) = μ(C1 + . . . + Cr−1) + μ(Cr) =
μ(C1) + . . . + μ(Cr) for ﬁnite sums.
Let {|k⟩; k = 1, . . . , n} be a basis for H. Then for any Hermitian operator C
we can write C = 
i,j cij|i⟩⟨j|, where cij are complex numbers satisfying cij∗=

Propositional Logic, Probabilities,
and Knowledge
One can distinguish between aleatoric probabilities and epistemic probabilities. The
ﬁrst ones are relevant for experimental data and for models of such data, and they
always satisfy Kolmogorov’s axioms. The last ones concern probabilities asserted
about the real world, often learned from data, and they may or may not satisfy the
Kolmogorov axioms. First I will discuss the case where these axioms are satisﬁed.
Mathematical logic can be studies at many different levels. In this book I will
concentrate on propositional logic, and I will look at propositions as they are
formulated in ordinary, everyday language as primitive entities. For a more formal
approach to propositional logic including axioms and a separation between syntax
and semantics, see for instance (Walicki, 2012).
Propositions A and B can be connected: A ∨B means that A or B is true, while
A ∧B means that both A and B are true, similarly for the connection between more
propositions. Also, ¬A means that A is not true. We let ⊥denote an impossible
proposition, while ⊤denotes a proposition that is always true. In ordinary texts in
mathematical logic one usually works with a ﬁnite number of propositions Ai. I will
allow for an inﬁnite, even uncountable number of propositions, so that propositions
of the form “The rain tomorrow will amount to less than or equal to x mm” will be
permitted for different x.
There is a close connection between propositional logic and set theory. The
translation is straightforward: ∨translates into ∪, while ∧translates into ∩; ¬A
corresponds to Ac, while ⊥, ⊤correspond to ∅, 
, assuming that all the sets are
subsets of 
.
One can also deﬁne probabilities of propositions; in fact this is often done in
elementary probability texts. With the above translations, there is a close connection
to Kolmogorov’s axioms; see Sect. 2.1. For instance P(A1 ∨A2 ∨. . .) = P(A1) +
P(A2)+. . . if the Ai’s satisfy Ai ∧Aj = ⊥for each pair. Also P(¬A) = 1−P(A).
The rule P(A ∨B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∧B) is always true. It can be proved
rigorously, but it can also be motivated by a Venn diagram from the analogue with
set theory.

Propositional Logic, Probabilities, and Knowledge
Conditional probabilities can be deﬁned by P(A|B) = P(A ∧B)/P(B) when
P(B) > 0. In this book I need the more general notion of conditional probability
given a σ-algebra of propositions B, and then it seems like we may need to assume a
little more structure. Assume thus that there exists a countable collection of atomic
propositions {Ci} such that all other propositions A can be formed by combining
the Ci’s by ∨’s, such that Ci ∧Cj = ⊥for pairs and ⊤= 
i Ci. This assumption
simpliﬁes the discussion. It is satisﬁed in the case of a ﬁnite number of propositions
closed under ∧and ¬. In general we can think of the Ci’s as formed by combining
all propositions of interest through ∧’s. The whole σ-algebra F is generated by the
Ci’s.
Let now the sub-σ-algebra B be generated by {Bj}, partly a subset of {Ci} and
partly formed by taking ∨of some Ci, such that Bj ∧Bk = ⊥for pairs and such
that ⊤= 
j Bj. Then we can deﬁne
P(A|B) =

j
P(A|Bj)1(Bj),
where 1(Bj) = 1 if Bj is true, 0 if it is not true. From this, P(A|B) is uniquely
deﬁned except on a set with probability 0. The analogue of the Radon–Nikodym
deﬁnition (2.1) is then

B
P(A|B)dP = P(A ∧B)
for all B ∈B. One of the open questions of this book is whether this formula can be
generalized in the context of propositional logic and then can be taken as a general
deﬁnition of P(A|B).
In the probabilistic treatment I assumed in Sect. 3.1 that the observations and
the parameters could be deﬁned on the same underlying probability space. In the
present setting I assume that all statements regarding conceptual variables can be
given as compatible propositions. The concept of an epistemic process is central
in this book. Before any observations are made, all statements of the form θ = u
are unknown, where θ is the relevant epistemic variable. After the observations are
done, some proposition Ak : (θ = uk) is known to some agent i in the simplest case.
The statement that Ak is known to agent i may be written KiAk, and the statement
that agent j knows that i knows Ak may be written KjKiAk. A survey of the formal
propositional logic related to such statements is given by Halpern (1995).
In Chap. 6 of this book I also discuss probabilities that do not satisfy Kol-
mogorov’s axioms. A special case of this is quantum probabilities, also treated in
other chapters of the book.

Appendix F
Group Theory in Statistical Inference
The use of group theory as a fundamental tool of statistical inference dates back
to the book and has been discussed by many others, in particular (Eaton, 1989).
The present discussion will follow largely (Helland, 2004, 2010); see also Sect. 2.2
above.
F.1
Basic Premises and Deﬁnitions
Simultaneous transformation of data and parameters should yield equivalent infer-
ence. A simple example may be scale transformation: It should not mean anything
for the inference whether you measure in meters, decimeters, yards, or inches or
whatever. Apart from scale transformations one can consider a change of origin,
rotation in multiple regression or multivariate analysis, permutation of the variables,
etc. A set of transformations form a group. One may have group actions on the
sample space and group actions on the parameter space. If one can come from any
point in the sample space to any other point, the group actions on the sample space
are called transitive. If one can come from any point in the parameter space to any
other point, the group actions on the parameter space are called transitive.
Assume a statistical model with data z and parameter θ; both can be multidi-
mensional. Let θ ∈ΩΘ, the parameter space. Start with transformations G on the
parameter space: θ →g(θ) or just θ →gθ such that gθ ∈ΩΘ always. For such
transformations we have:
– The identity e is given by eθ = θ.
– Composition g1g2 is given by (g1g2)θ = (g1(g2θ)).
– It is natural to deﬁne inverses g−1 such that g−1g = gg−1 = e.
Then G is a group.

F
Group Theory in Statistical Inference
There is a basic nuisance with this common notation, however: The composition
g1g2 corresponds to applying g2 ﬁrst and then g1. Sometimes, as in Helland (2010),
to avoid this, one uses the right notation θ →θg. Then θ(g1g2) = (θg1)g2. This
right notation will not be used here.
Sometimes, but not always, the group G is induced by a group G∗on the sample
space. The mechanism is as follows, using the invariance of the statistical model:
P θ(z ∈A) = P gθ(g∗z ∈A) = P gθ(z ∈g∗−1A),
(F.1)
so
P gθ(z ∈B) = P θ(z ∈g∗B).
(F.2)
Then the two groups are, by a very useful concept, homomorphic: When g∗=
g∗
1g∗
2, then g = g1g2. Very often, the groups will be isomorphic: In addition, when
g∗= e∗then g = e. For isomorphic groups, often the same group symbols are used.
In general, the choice of the groups G∗and G shall correspond to some symmetry
aspect of the situation. Some people may object that this choice may be subjective.
To this one could only say that the choice of model is subjective, the choice of prior
may be subjective, and the choice of loss function may be subjective.
The group G can be transitive or not transitive on ΩΘ. It is transitive if each
point in ΩΘ can be reached from each other point by a group action. When it is not
transitive, we have several orbits.
Deﬁnition F1 Start with a point θ0 in the parameter space. Then the orbit contain-
ing θ0 is the collection of points gθ0 for g ∈G.
Lemma F1
(a) If θ1 is another point on this orbit, then the orbit can also be written as {gθ1 :
g ∈G}.
(b) The orbits are disjoint, and together they ﬁll the whole parameter space.
Proof Straightforward.
⊓⊔
The isotropy group at a point θ ∈ΩΘ is the set of all g ∈G such that gθ = θ.
This turns out to be a subgroup of G, and all the isotropy groups as θ varies are
isomorphic. Often, the isotropy group is trivial.
F.2
Subparameters and Permissibility
As in the above, let a group G be acting on the parameter space ΩΘ. Consider a
subparameter η = η(θ).
Deﬁnition F2 We say that η is permissible if for each pair (θ1, θ2) we have that
η(θ1) = η(θ2) implies η(gθ1) = η(gθ2) for all g ∈G.

F
Group Theory in Statistical Inference
227
Theorem F1
(a) If η is permissible, one can deﬁne a group ˜G on the range of η by ( ˜gη)(θ) =
η(gθ). The mapping from G to ˜G implied by this is a homomorphism.
(b) It G is transitive on ΩΘ, then ˜G is transitive on η(ΩΘ).
Proof
(a) Fix θ1 ∈ΩΘ and deﬁne ˜gη(θ1) = η(gθ1) for g ∈G. Then for all θ2 ∈ΩΘ
such that η(θ2) = η(θ1), we have η(gθ2) = η(gθ1). In this way we can
uniquely deﬁne ˜gη(θ) = η(gθ) on each level set of the function η. This
gives a group action: The unit ˜e is deﬁned by ˜eη(θ) = η(eθ) = η(θ) and
composition by ˜g1 ˜g2η(θ) = ˜g1η(g2θ) = η(g1g2θ). The inverse is deﬁned by
˜g−1η(θ) = η(g−1θ). From this, one easily proves ˜g−1 ˜g = ˜g ˜g−1 = ˜e.
(b) Let ηi = η(θi) ∈η(ΩΘ) for i=1,2. If θ2 = gθ1 for some g, then η2 = ˜gη1.
⊓⊔
Example 1 Let z = {x1, . . . , xn} be a sequence of N(μ, σ 2) variables, let θ =
(μ, σ), and let G be the location and scale group: μ →c + bμ, σ →bσ.
Then examples of permissible subparameters are μ, σ, log(σ), arc tg(μ), μ+σ, μ+
1.96σ,. . . Examples of non-permissible subparameters are |μ|, I(σ ≤1), μ +
σ 2, log(μ2 + σ),. . .
The concept of permissibility is connected to several deep problems in statistical
inference, as brieﬂy discussed in Helland (2004). First, one should mention Peter
McCullagh’s general categorical theory-based requirements on statistical models,
see McCullagh (2002); Helland (2002). Next, under transitivity and other week
assumption it implies that Bayesian credibility sets based on a right invariant
prior and frequentist conﬁdence sets are numerically equal. Finally, the assumption
of permissibility and the use of right invariant prior turn out to be enough to
eliminate the marginalization paradoxes of , and also some similar inconsistencies,
see Helland (2002).
The basic notion for statistical inference in Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2013) is
that there is an underlying measurable space (Ω, F) and that both the parameter θ
and the data z are seen as measurable functions on this space. One can then assume
that there is a group H acting on the elements ω of Ω and that θ(ω) and z(ω) are
permissible functions with respect to H. This will induce the groups G acting on
θ and the group G∗acting on z. This is not a necessary construction, but it is a
possible construction.
Also, in Taraldsen and Lindqvist (2013) there is assumed a space of actions a =
δ(z). Assuming that the function δ is permissible with respect to G∗, this induces a
group G∗∗on the space of actions. All these group inductions are homomorphisms.
Thus the concept of permissibility is important and deserves a further study.
According to Deﬁnition F2 this concept means that for all group elements g the
variables η(gθ) should be constant whenever η(θ) is constant. In other words: The
level sets of the function η(·) are transformed into other level sets by elements of
the group G.

228
F
Group Theory in Statistical Inference
Theorem F2
(a) The full variable θ is always permissible.
(b) Any invariant function (η(gθ) = η(θ)) is permissible. For such functions the
action of ˜G on η is trivial.
(c) If ξ(·) is permissible with range Ξ, and γ (·) is a one-to-one function from Ξ
onto a space Γ , then η given by η(θ) = γ (ξ(θ)) is permissible.
(d) If ξ(·) is permissible under G with range Ξ, and γ (·) is a permissible function
under the corresponding ˜G from Ξ onto a space Γ , then η given by η(θ) =
γ (ξ(θ)) is permissible under G.
(e) If η1(θ), . . . , ηn(θ) are n permissible functions, then the vector variable given
by η(θ) = (η1(θ), . . . , ηn(θ)) is permissible and vice versa.
(f) Under the location and scale group (μ →bμ + c, σ →bσ) in a location
and scale family θ = (μ, σ), a one-dimensional variable η = η(μ, σ) is
permissible if and only if it is of the form η = ψ(b1μ + b2σ) for some one-to-
one function ψ. In particular, the variables μ, σ and μ + bσ are permissible.
(g) Under the location group (μ →μ + c, σ →σ) in a location and scale family
θ = (μ, σ), a one-dimensional parameter η = η(μ, σ) is permissible if and
only if it is a one-to-one function of σ or it is of the form η = ψ(μ + φ(σ)),
where ψ is a one-to-one function and φ is an arbitrary function. In particular,
the variables μ, σ and μ + bσ are permissible.
(h) Assume that the variable ξ with range Ξ is permissible under a group G. Let
E be a set in Ξ. Then the indicator variable ηE(ξ(θ)), which is 1 iff ξ(θ) ∈E,
and is otherwise 0, is permissible iff E is equal to the union of orbits under the
induced group ˜G.
Proof The proofs of most of the above are straightforward, given the deﬁnition of
permissibility. The proofs of (f) and (h) are given:
(f) If and only if η has this given form, we have that η(μ1, σ1) = η(μ2, σ2) implies
b1μ1 +b2σ1 = b1μ2 +b2σ2. But this is equivalent to b1(bμ1 +c)+b2(bσ1) =
b1(bμ2 + c) + b2(bσ2) and thus η(bμ1 + c, bσ1) = η(bμ2 + c, bσ2).
(h) The indicator variable is permissible if and only if ξE(gθ) is constantly one or
zero for any ﬁxed g whenever ξE(θ) is constantly 1, that is, gθ ∈E or Ec
whenever θ ∈E. The case Ec can be excluded by putting θ = g−1θ0. By
varying g, the case E means just that E is a union of orbits of ˜G.
⊓⊔
The simplest case of claim (h) is when the variable ξ(θ) is invariant under G.
Then the condition holds for any (measurable) E.
If some given variable η(θ) should not be permissible under G, one can always
solve this in principle by using a subgroup. If this is a genuine subgroup, it cannot be
transitive on ΩΘ. It may then be necessary to reduce ΩΘ to an orbit of the subgroup.
Lemma F2 Given a variable η(θ) there is always a maximal subgroup G0 of G
such that η is permissible under G0.

F
Group Theory in Statistical Inference
229
Proof Let G0 be the set of all g ∈G such that for all θ1, θ2 ∈ΩΘ we have
η(θ1) = η(θ2) if and only if η(kθ1) = η(kθ2). Then G0 contains the identity.
Furthermore, using the deﬁnition with θ1, θ2 replaced by g2θ1, g2θ2, it follows that
g1g2 ∈G0 whenever g1 ∈G0 and g2 ∈G0. Using the deﬁnition with θ1, θ2
replaced by g−1θ1, g−1θ2, it follows that it contains inverses. Hence, G0 is a group.
It follows by the construction that it is maximal.
