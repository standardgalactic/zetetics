Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form large congested tree-
hanging clusters made solely of bees attached to each other1. 
How these structures are maintained under the influence of 
dynamic mechanical forcing is unknown. To address this, we 
created pendant clusters and subject them to dynamic loads 
of varying orientation, amplitude, frequency and duration. 
We find that horizontally shaken clusters adapt by spread-
ing out to form wider, flatter cones that recover their original 
shape when unloaded. Measuring the response of a cluster to 
an impulsive pendular excitation shows that flattened cones 
deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones (that is, 
they are more stable). Particle-based simulations of a passive 
assemblage suggest a behavioural hypothesis: individual bees 
respond to local variations in strain by moving up the strain 
gradient, which is qualitatively consistent with our observa-
tions of individual bee movement during dynamic loading. The 
simulations also suggest that vertical shaking will not lead 
to significant differential strains and thus no shape adapta-
tion, which we confirmed experimentally. Together, our find-
ings highlight how a super-organismal structure responds 
to dynamic loading by actively changing its morphology to 
improve the collective stability of the cluster at the expense 
of increasing the average mechanical burden of an individual.
Collective dynamics allow super-organisms to function in ways 
that a single organism cannot, by virtue of their emergent size, 
shape, physiology and behaviour2. Classic examples include the 
physiological and behavioural strategies seen in social insects (for 
example, ants that link their bodies to form rafts to survive floods3–6, 
assemble pulling chains to move food items7, and form bivouacs8 
and towers9, as well as bridges and ladders to traverse rough ter-
rain10). Similarly, groups of `daddy longlegs’ (order Opiliones) 
huddle together and emperor penguins cluster together for ther-
moregulation purposes11. While much is known about the static 
forms that are seen in such situations, the stability of these forms to 
dynamic perturbation, and their global adaptation to environmental  
changes is much less understood.
European honeybees, Apis mellifera L., show many of these col-
lective behaviours during their life cycle1. For example, colonies 
reproduce through colony fission, a process in which a subset of 
the colony’s workers and a queen leave the hive, separate from 
the parent colony and form a cluster on a nearby tree branch1. In 
these swarm clusters (which we will refer to as clusters), the bees 
adhere to each other and form a large structure made of ~10,000 
individuals and hundreds of times the size of a single organism  
(Fig. 1a). Generally, this hanging mass of adhered bees takes on 
the shape of an inverted pendant cone; however, the resultant 
shape is also influenced by the surface to which the cluster is 
clinging to (see two different examples in Fig. 1a). The cluster can 
stay in place for several days as scout bees search the surrounding 
area for suitable nest sites1.
The colony is exposed to the environment during this stage and 
shows several behaviours to cope with the fluctuating thermal and 
mechanical environment. For instance, clusters tune their density 
and surface area to volume ratio to maintain a near constant core 
temperature despite large fluctuations in the ambient tempera-
ture12–14. Furthermore, at high temperatures, the swarm expands 
and forms channels that are presumed to aid in air circulation12. 
Moreover, in response to rain, bees at the surface arrange themselves 
to form `shingles’, shedding moisture efficiently from the surface 
of the cluster15. Similarly, the cluster is mechanically stable; while it 
sways from side to side in the wind (for example, see Supplementary 
Video 1), it could be catastrophic if the cluster breaks (when a criti-
cal load occurs) as the bees would lose the ability to minimize sur-
face area to prevent hypothermia, while still being mechanically 
stable. However, the mechanism by which a multitude of bees work 
together to create and maintain a stable structure that handles both 
static gravity and dynamic shaking stimuli (for example, wind and 
predators) remains elusive. To understand this, we develop a labo-
ratory experimental set-up, for ease of visualization and manipula-
tion, to quantify the response of a honeybee cluster to mechanical 
shaking over short and long times.
To prepare a cluster, we attach a caged queen (see Supplementary 
Section A) to a board and allowed a cluster to form around her (Fig. 1b).  
The bees at the base grip onto an area that is roughly circular. 
The board is controlled by a motor that can produce movement 
in the horizontal direction at different frequencies (0.5–5 Hz) and 
accelerations (ranged 0–0.1g). We apply both discontinuous shak-
ing in which the acceleration is kept constant and the frequency 
is modified, and vice versa, continuous shaking in which the 
frequency is kept constant and the acceleration is modified (see 
Supplementary Fig. 2).
For the case of horizontal shaking (for both discontinuous and 
continuous), the tall conical cluster swings to and fro in a pendular 
mode (one of the lowest energy modes of motion, see Supplementary 
Section C), with a typical frequency of ~1 Hz. However, over longer 
durations (that is, minutes), the bees adapt by spreading themselves 
into a flatter conical form (Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Video 2), 
while their total number remains constant (measured by the total 
weight of the cluster). The final shape flattens as the shaking con-
tinues for longer, or as the frequency and acceleration of shaking 
increases. For the discontinuous shaking, when we plot the relative 
extent of spreading (scaled by a constant) as measured by A(t)/A(0) 
for all different frequencies, as a function of number of shakes, the 
data collapse onto a single curve (Fig. 2a). This suggests that the

cluster response scales with both the number and magnitude of 
shakes, but over much longer timescales than an individual event. 
The nature of this response is independent of the type of stimulus: 
when the shaking signal is continuous, we see a similar response 
(Fig. 2b). The graded adaptive response that scales with the num-
ber of shakes and is a function of applied displacements and fre-
quencies, and the absence of any adaptation to very low frequencies 
and amplitudes (orange curves in Fig. 2b), suggests that there is a 
critical relative displacement (that is, a threshold mechanical strain) 
needed to trigger this adaptation. Once the shaking stops, the cluster 
returns to its original elongated cone configuration over a period of 
30–120 min, a time that is much larger than the time for the cluster to 
flatten. This reversible cluster shape change in response to dynamic 
loading might be a functional adaptation that increases the mechan-
ical stability of a flattened cluster relative to an elongated one.
To explore this suggestion quantitatively, we first define a labo-
ratory-fixed coordinate system with axes as shown in Fig. 2c, with 
respect to which the board is at

. This allows us to 
track individual bees16 along the surface of the cluster along the cen-
treline Xi(0) = 0 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Video 3), over a period 
of oscillation. Comparing trajectories of bees in an elongated cluster 
and a flat cluster (that is, before and after shaking) shows that relative 
displacement between the bees at the cluster tip and bees at the base 
is significantly larger for an elongated cluster. Snapshots of tracked 
bees highlight the decoupling of movement of the tip and base of the 
cluster; that is, local deformations such as normal and shear strains 
are reduced in the mechanically adapted state corresponding to a 
spread cluster. A similar trend is observed when the cluster is sub-
jected to a single sharp shake (see signal at Supplementary Fig. 2c), 
as shown in Supplementary Video 4. These measurements confirm 
that the adapted flattened structure is indeed more mechanically 
stable in the presence of dynamic horizontal loads.
The spreading of the cluster is a collective process, begging the 
question of how this collective spreading behaviour is achieved. To 
study this, we tracked bees on the surface of the cluster during the pro-
cess of adaptive spreading, particularly at the early stages. In Fig. 2e  
and Supplementary Video 5, we show how bees move from the tip 
regions that are subject to large relative displacements towards the base 
regions that are subject to small relative displacements. This suggests 
a simple behavioural law wherein the change in relative displace-
ment Ui between neighbouring bees is a driver of shape adaptation: 
individual bees sense the local deformation relative to their neigh-
bours and move towards regions of lower Ui (illustrated in Fig. 2f).  
In the continuum limit, this corresponds to their ability to sense 
strain gradients, and move from regions of lower strain (near the 
free tip) towards regions of higher strain (near the fixed base). It is 
worth noting here that this behavioural law is naturally invariant to 
rigid translation and rotation of the cluster, and thus depends only 
on the local mechanical environment each bee experiences.
However, what measure of the relative displacements might the 
bees be responding to? To understand this, we note that the fun-
damental modes17 of a pendant elastic cone are similar to those of 
a pendulum swinging from side to side, and a spring bouncing up 
and down, and their frequencies monotonically increase as a func-
tion of the aspect ratio of the cluster (Supplementary Fig. 3; see 
Supplementary Section C for details). To quantify the deviations

from this simple picture due to the particulate nature of the assem-
blage, we turn to a computational model of the passive dynamics 
of a cluster and explore the role of shape on a pendant mechani-
cal assemblage of passive particles used to mimic bees. We model 
each bee in the cluster as a spherical particle that experiences three 
forces: a gravitational force, an attractive force between neigh-
bouring particles, and a force that prevents inter-particle penetra-
tion (see Supplementary Section C for further details). The bees 
at the base are assumed to be strongly attached to the supporting 
board, and those on the surface are assumed to be free. To study 
the passive response of the entire system, the board is oscillated 
at different frequencies and amplitudes, while we follow the dis-
placement of individual particles, U r( )

placement between neighbouring bees

As expected, we see that for the same forcing, the maximum

local strains can serve as a signal for the bees to move, and a natural 
hypothesis is that once the signal is above a certain critical value, 
the bees move. However, how might they chose a direction? While

Fig. 2 | Quantifying adaptive response of the cluster to horizontal shaking. For all shaking frequencies, the base contact area of the cluster increases 
monotonically until a plateau is reached. Once shaking ceases, the cluster responds by gradually reverting to its original shape by increasing its contact 
area, but at a much slower rate. a, Ratio of the contact area of the base of the cluster divided by its original area A(t)/A(0) as a function of time, for the 
discontinuous case. The colours represent results for different frequencies of periodic shaking. The inset shows that the scaled base area collapses onto 
a master curve when plotted versus the number of shaking events. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of three individual trials (see 
Supplementary Table 1 for more information about trial repetitions). b, A(t)/A(0) for continuous shaking shows the same qualitative behaviour; note that 
when the acceleration is very small (0.01g), there is no response (that is, there is a critical threshold of forcing below which the bees do not respond).

it may be plausible for the bees to simply move upwards against 
gravity, it is probably difficult to sense a static force (that is, gravity)  
when experiencing large dynamic forcing (that is, shaking) in a 
tightly packed assemblage. Instead, we turn to ask whether there 
are any local signals that would give honeybees a sense of direction. 
For all clusters, the strains are largest near the base (Fig. 3a,b and 
Supplementary Video 6) and decrease away from it, but in addi-
tion, as the cluster becomes more elongated, there are large local 
strains along the contact line where x = ± L1/2, where the bees are in 
contact with the baseboard. This is due to the effect of the pendular 
mode of deformation that leads to rotation-induced stretching in 
these regions. To quantify how the normal and shear strain vary as 
a function of the distance from the base, Z, we average δ li and δ θi 
over all bees that were at a certain Z position at t = 0 and define the 
following mean quantities: δ l(Z) = ⟨δ ⟩
li , and δ θ(Z) = θ
δ i , where 
the angle brackets indicate the average overall spring connection 
at the vertical position r (0)
z
i
 = Z. Similar to the experimental data, 
the simulations show that the displacements Ui for horizontal shak-
ing of elongated clusters are larger in comparison to flattened clus-
ters. As both strains δ l(Z) and δ θ(Z) are largest near the base, z = 0 
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Video 6), and decrease away from the 
supporting baseboard, they may serve as local signals that bees at 
the tip of the cluster respond to by moving up the strain gradient 
(Supplementary Figs. 3–5 and Supplementary Videos 7 and 8).
This passive signature of a horizontally shaken assemblage sug-
gests a simple behavioural hypothesis: bees can sense the local 
variations in the normal strain above a critical threshold, and move 
slowly up gradients collectively. We note that mechanical strain is 
invariant to translation and rotation of the whole assemblage; that 
is, it is independent of the origin and orientation of the frame of 
reference, and thus a natural choice (similar to how cells and bac-
teria respond to mechanical stresses18). This behaviour will natu-
rally lead to spreading of the cluster and thence smaller strains on 
the cluster. Noting that the timescale of the response of the bees 
is of the order of minutes while the duration of a single period is 
seconds, it is natural to consider the integrated local normal strain

. We note that moving up a gra-
dient in time-integrated normal strain would also suffice to explain 
the observed mechanical adaptation.
We carry out our simulations of the active cluster in two dimen-
sions for simplicity and speed (we do not expect any changes in 
three dimensions), allowing bonds to break and reform on the basis 
of proximity, similar to how bees form connections, and follow the 
shape of the cluster while it is shaken horizontally. We find that 
over time, the cluster spreads out to form a flattened cone (Fig. 3d,e 
and Supplementary Video 7), confirming that the local behavioural 
rule that integrates relative displacements that arise due to long-
range passive coupling in the mechanical assemblage wherein bees 
actively move up the local gradient in normal strain δ li is consistent 
with our observations.
If sufficiently large dynamic normal strain gradients drive 
shape adaptation, different shaking protocols that result in lower 
local strains should limit adaptation. One way is to shake the 
cluster gently, and this indeed leads to no adaptation (Fig. 2b 
responding to 0.01g). Another way to test our hypothesis is to 
shake the cluster vertically, exciting the spring-like mode of the 
assemblage. For the same range of amplitudes and frequencies as 
used for horizontal shaking, our simulations of a passive assem-
blage show that vertical shaking results in particles being col-
lectively displaced up and down, with little variations in normal 
strain. As expected, even in active clusters with the behavioural 
rule implemented, little or no adaptation occurs as the threshold 
normal strain gradient is not achieved (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 
6 and Supplementary Video 8). To test this experimentally, we 
shake the cluster vertically. We see that, in this case, the cluster 
shape remains approximately constant (Fig. 4a,b) until a critical 
acceleration is reached, at which time a propagating crack results 
in the detachment of the cluster from the board (Supplementary 
Video 9). The resulting displacements at the tip for vertical shak-
ing and horizontal shaking are in agreement with our hypothesis 
that differential normal strain gradients drive adaptation (Fig. 4c 
and Supplementary Video 10).
Our study has shown how dynamic loading of honeybee swarm 
clusters leads to mechanical adaptation wherein the cluster spreads 
out in response to repeated shaking that induced sufficiently large 
gradients in the relative displacements between individuals. We 
show that this adaptive morphological response increases the 
mechanical stability of the cluster. A computational model of the 
bee cluster treated as an active mechanical assemblage suggests 
that the active behavioural response of bees to local strain gradi-
ents can drive bee movement from regions of low strain to those 
of high strain and cause the cluster to flatten. This behavioural 
response improves the collective stability of the cluster as a whole 
via a reversible shape change, at the expense of increasing the 
time-averaged mechanical burden experienced by the individual.

Experimental Methods
A.1
Study site.
All clusters were studied at Harvard University, Concord Field Station, Bedford, Massachusetts
(42◦30N, 72◦10W).

A.2
Cluster preparation.
Animal research was conducted in accordance with the institutional animal care and use pro-
tocols of Harvard University. All of the clusters studied were artiﬁcial clusters were bought
from honeybee suppliers (New England Beekeeping LTD, and Gold Star bees LTD), where the
colony (10,000 worker/drone bees and a queen) is conﬁned in a wooden box. Bees were a mix
of Russian, Italian, and Carniolan bees. Clusters were prepared by separating the queen from
the rest of the colony. The queen is placed in a small queen cage (3.2 x 10.0 x 1.6 cm). Next,
the cluster box was opened and the queen (still in her own cage) was fastened to a cluster mount
at position Ui = Vi = Wi = 0. The worker bees were then shaken onto the base of the mount
whereupon they clustered around their queen.
A.3
Apparatus.
To analyze the mechanisms of mechanical stress adaptation, the clusters were mounted on
a cluster mount (see Fig. 1B and Fig. 1A,B) which consists of a horizontal wooden board.
The board was controlled by a motor (purchased from Applied Motion) that produced periodic
movement in the horizontal or vertical axis at different frequencies and forces. The shape of
the cluster was recorded via cameras (Logitech C270) positioned at three orthogonal locations
(front, bottom, and side). Positions of individual bees were recorded using a high-speed frontal
camera (SA3, Fastec Imaging) recording at 500 fps, and an 8−megapixel iSight camera record-
ing at 240 fps. Ambient temperature was recorded using a digital thermometer (A150Q Tech
Instrumentation) that was ﬁxed to the cluster mount, 2 cm above the clustered bees. Forces
were measured using an accelerometer (SparkFun ADXL335) mounted on the wooden board.
A.4
Procedure.
A trial recording lasted 60 minutes, where shaking was applied for 30 minutes, and then no
shaking was applied for additional 30 minutes. Equilibration period of 1 hour was applied
within trials. During this time, the bees were fed ad libitum with a sugar solution (1:1 by
volume, granulated sucrose: liquid water) by spraying it onto the cluster with a squirt bottle.
Unless stated otherwise, single shaking response was recorded before the trial, and after 30
minutes. The responses to each mechanical shaking condition were replicated three times.
Experiments were performed at 22 ± 2◦C.

Figure 1: Experimental Setup: A) Horizontal shaking B) Vertical shaking. For the vertical shaking, the motor
setup was rotated 90◦to produce movement along the z axis.
A.5
Video analysis.
The shape of the cluster was extracted using the image analysis tool box of MATLAB 2016a.
In particular, the base area, A(t) was identiﬁed using image segmentation with a threshold
value to turn the gray-scale image into a binary image. The number of pixels belonging to the
base segment were translated to area using the pixel to cm2 conversion via a calibration object.
Individual honeybee positions were digitized using a freely available MATLAB application,
DLTdv5 (?).

B
Continuous vs. Discontinous Shakings
The measured accelerations during shaking events were recorded using an accelerometer mounted
on the wooden board, and are shown in Fig. 2A, and Fig. 2B, for periodic and discontinuous
shaking, respectively.

acceleration is modiﬁed. B) Discontinuous shaking in which the acceleration is kept constant and the frequency

Statistical Tests
In this section we describe a series of statistical tests we perform to compare the observed
experimental results across the varied experimental parameters.
We consider the time series of the ratio of the contact area of the base of the cluster divided
by its original area A(t)/A(0) as a function of time. We calculated the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient between the time series of the continuous shaking, the horizontal and vertical case,
for intensities 0.025g, 0.050g, and 0.075g. P–values for testing the hypothesis that there is no
relationship between the observed time series (null hypothesis) are summarized in Table S3.
This shows that all pairs of horizontal trials are signiﬁcantly different, all pairs of vertical trials
are not signiﬁcantly different (p < 0.05). At low shaking intensities (0.025 g), the horizontal
and vertical results are not signiﬁcantly different, as in both cases the swarm doesn’t ﬂatten. As
the intensity increases the horizontal and vertical results differ signiﬁcantly p < 0.01 (for the
0.05 intensity) and p < 0.001 (for the 0.075 intensity).

Numerical Model
Each honeybee is modeled as a 3D spherical particle of diameter a. Clusters at time t = 0
consisted of 1000 bees connected by linear springs arranged in a face centered lattice over a
volume deﬁned by a half-ellipsoid volume at different aspect ratios (i.e. different Lz/Lx values,
as deﬁned in Fig. ??A). The board is represented as an additional layer of bees that serve as
a physical non-permiable barrier. Their position is ﬁxed as the position of the board −−!
rb(t) =
[Ub, Vb, Wb], and they are not subjected to Newton’s equation of motion.
The rest of the bees (not represented on the board) experience three types of forces in the
simulation. The ﬁrst is the truncated Lennard Jones (LJ) deﬁned as:

where k is the spring coefﬁcient. The third force is gravity, deﬁned as:

where g is the gravitational constant and m is the mass of a particle.
D.1
Normal modes.
To characterize the frequency of the lowest mode of the cluster, we perform Normal Mode Anal-
ysis (NMA) (?) on clusters of different aspect ratios. The free motion described by the normal
modes takes place at ﬁxed frequencies that depend on its structure, materials and boundary con-
ditions. In this context, the lower the frequency, the less energy it takes to invoke its associated
mode of motion and thus more likely to occur.
We force the top layer of bees to remain stationary. We assume small deformations of the
network (Xi << 1) and Taylor expand the potential V . We take into consideration elements
8

up to power 2 of Xi, where Xi is the length of spring i minus its equilibrium length. The
corresponding force on particles connected by spring i is:
Fi = riV =

where Xi and Xj are the x−positions of particle i and j, respectively; Yi and Yj are the
y−positions of particle i and j, respectively; Zi and Zj are the z−positions of particle i and

general case of N particles connected by M springs in a 3D system, the second derivatives of
the overall potential are organized in the 3N ⇥3N Hessian matrix H. H is composed of N ⇥N

The equation of motions can then be written as F = H · D, where
D = (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2 · · · Xn, Yn, Zn)
(8)
is vector of all X, Y and Z positions of particles in the system. We solve M ¨D −HD = 0 by
converting it to the following Eigen value problem of the Hessian matrix: (H −λI) = 0, where
λ is a set of the Eigen values and I is a unit matrix. The Eigen values represent frequencies of
motion, and the Eigen vectors represent displacement of all particles in the system.
As expected, the pendular motion is the lowest frequency normal mode of the elongated
cluster (Fig. 3). It is the most likely to occur naturally (under the NMA assumptions) and thus
also the most relevant stimulus the honeybees experience. The frequency associated with the
pendular mode increases monotonically as a function of the aspect ratio of the cluster, Lz/Lx.
Therefore, modulation of the aspect ratio sufﬁces to reduce the strain.

dulum modes - consistent with experimental observations. A) Illustration of the displacements associated with
pendulum (top) and spring (bottom) modes. B) The normal mode’s frequencies as a function of aspect ratio.
D.2
Passive simulations to extract local strains.
To extract the local strains, the positions of the top bees were manipulated to produced periodic
movement in the horizontal or vertical axis at different frequencies and forces (similarly to
the experiments, e.g., Fig. ??C). The rest of the bees obey the Langevin equations of motion:
˙ri = pi/m, and ˙pi = −⇣pi + fi, where ˙ri is the velocity of particle i; ⇣is the friction; fi is the
force acting on the particle. The bees experience all three forces mentioned above: F LJ, F s,
and F g with associated parameters listed in Table S2.
Local instantaneous strains were measured relative to a reference conﬁguration in the
absence of shaking at t = 0, as shown in Fig. ??A–C and Fig. 3, according to the deﬁnitions in
the main text.
Time integrated local strains presented in Fig. ??D–E, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 were deﬁned
using a modiﬁed instantaneous signal:

deﬁned as f

and is chosen to be the period of the shaking.
D.3
Active stochastic simulations to follow active behavior
We performed a Stochastic Dynamics simulations to follow the active behavior of bees. The
bees obey the over–damped equations of motion: ˙ri = −fi + ˜ri, where ˜ri is a Gaussian random
number with mean zero and variance ⌘. fi is the force acting on the particle which include F LJ,
F s, and an active force F active, with associated parameters listed in Table S2.
When f

If an active honeybee has less than 6 spring bonded interactions it would have a tendency
to move towards one of its neighbors and could lead to pathological expansion of cavities in
the cluster. To prevent this, we allow bees to become active only if they have 6 spring bonded
interactions.

E
Response to Horizontal vs. Vertical Shakings
To test the differential strain hypothesis, we simulate the active model and compare the response
of the cluster to horizontal and vertical shaking. Both the maximal instantaneous normal strain
(Fig. 4) as well as the integrated normal strain (Fig. 4) are higher in response to a horizon-
tal shaking. Therefore, there exists an activation threshold f
δlt
iC, such that most bees will not
respond to vertical shaking but would respond to horizontal shaking. Indeed, we see that in
this case the cluster shape remains approximately constant when vertical shaking are applied
(Fig. 4C–D), while the the bees adapt by spreading themselves into a squatter conical form
when horizontal shaking are applied (Fig. 4A–B).

Figure 4: Passive simulations of a 3D clusters. A) Clusters of different aspect ratios (Lz/Lx), shown at an
extreme end of an oscillation associated with largest normal strains. Colors represent the local normal strain of
each honeybee δli. Elongated clusters (on the right) experience a larger deformation at the tip of the cluster, while
squat clusters (on the left) experience low deformations. Fountain plots show the mean normal strain (δl(Z)) as a
function of the distance from the base, Z, and aspect ratio Lz/Lx. B) Same as A for a vertical shaking. C,D) same
as A,B for the mean shear strain (δ✓(Z)).

Figure 6: Active stochastic simulations in which the bees monitor their local deformation and follow a local rule
in which once the deformation is larger than a certain threshold, the honeybee has a bias to move toward a region
of higher local deformation. In agreement with experimental results, spreading occurs during horizontal shaking
(A) but not during vertical shaking (C), in agreement with the experimental results. Colors represent the local
integrated signal, f
δlt
i, and arrows represent the direction towards higher local signal. B,D) The relative base area
as a function of time is similar to the results of experiments, with the probability distribution function of vertical
displacement shows a net negative response, i.e. bees move upwards on average, for horizontal and vertical shaking
respectively.

Description of Supplementary Movies
F.1
Movie S1 Honeybee cluster in the wind
Feral cluster at the study cite, in the presence of wind. Acquisition and playback frame rate:
3 ⇥102 fps.
F.2
Movie S2 Time-lapse of horizontal shaking experiment
A time lapse video showing the shape change of the cluster during a horizontal shaking trial.
Top panel: front view; Bottom panel: bottom view. Acquisition frame rate: 5 ⇥10−2 fps.
Playback sped up ⇥600. The applied shaking is discontinuous, in which the acceleration is kept
constant and the frequency was set to 5Hz (see signal in Fig. 2B).
F.3
Movie S3 Before/after horizontal shaking experiment - response to
continuous shaking
High–speed video of a single sharp horizontal shaking. Top: the cluster before a shaking trial.
Bottom: the cluster after a shaking trial of continuous shaking with an acceleration of 0.075g.
Acquisition frame rate: 5 ⇥102 fps. Playback slowed down ⇥16.
F.4
Movie S4 Before/after horizontal shaking experiment - response to a
single sharp shake
High–speed video of a single sharp horizontal shaking. Top: the cluster before a shaking trial.
Bottom: the cluster after a shaking trial of continuous shaking with an acceleration of 0.075g.
Acquisition frame rate: 5 ⇥102 fps. Playback slowed down ⇥16.
F.5
Movie S5 Tracking individual bees during horizontal shaking experi-
ment
High–speed video of the ﬁrst 5 minutes of a horizontal shaking trial where the camera was
mounted to the board. The shaking applied was continuous with an acceleration of 0.075g.
17

Acquisition frame rate: 2.4 ⇥102 fps. Playback sped up ⇥60. Each tracked honeybee is
highlighted in a different color. Trajectories of individual bees show that when the cluster
spreads out, surface bees move upwards.
F.6
Movie S6 Passive simulations to extract local strains
Dynamics simulations of a 3D clusters of different aspect ratios (Lz/Lx). Colors represent the
local normal strain of each honeybee δli. The movies illustrate the following:
1. Elongated clusters experience a larger deformation (δli) at the tip of the cluster than at the
base, while squat clusters experience low deformations everywhere.
2. In comparison to horizontal shaking, vertical shaking result in a minute δli.
F.7
Movies S7–8 Active simulations
Simulation of an active cluster in which the bees monitor their local deformation and follow a
local rule in which once the deformation is larger than a certain threshold, the honeybee has a
bias to move toward a region of higher local deformation. This leads to spreading when hor-
izontal shaking are applied and no spreading when vertical shaking are applied, in agreement
with the experimental results. Colors represent the local integrated signal, f
δlt
i, and arrows repre-
sent the direction towards higher local signal. The accelerations applied to the board @2Ub/@2t,
and @2Wb/@2t, are shown at the upper right corner of the movies.
