Anderson localization conﬁnes the wave function of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional
random potential to a volume of the order of the localization length ξ. Nonlinear add-ons to the
wave dynamics mimic many-body interactions on a mean ﬁeld level, and result in escape from
the Anderson cage and in unlimited subdiﬀusion of the interacting cloud. We address quantum
corrections to that subdiﬀusion by i) using the ultrafast unitary Floquet dynamics of discrete-time
quantum walks, ii) an interaction strength ramping to speed up the subdiﬀusion, and iii) an action
quantization of the nonlinear terms. We observe the saturation of the cloud expansion of N particles
to a volume ∼Nξ. We predict and observe a universal intermediate logarithmic expansion regime
which connects the mean ﬁeld diﬀusion with the ﬁnal quantum saturation regime and is entirely
controlled by particle number N. The temporal window of that regime grows exponentially with
the localization length ξ.
Introduction.— Single particle quantum dynamics in a
one-dimensional space with uncorrelated disorder results
in Anderson localization (AL), i.e. conﬁnement to a ﬁ-
nite localization volume of the order of the localization
length ξ [1]. The evolution of an initially localized quan-
tum wave packet will consist of an (almost ballistic) ex-
pansion up to the volume ∼ξ [2] with a subsequent halt
and exponential wavefunction localization in the tails [3].
Experimental veriﬁcations of AL with Bose-Einstein con-
densates of ultracold atomic gases loaded onto optical po-
tentials were reported harvesting on the halt of the wave
packet expansion [4].
Many-body interactions alter the picture. Full scale
computations of temporal evolutions are restricted to two
or three interacting particles only, with the complexity
quickly increasing due to the Hilbert space dimension
proliferation [5–23]. Increasing the number of particles
is predicted to result in a slow subdiﬀusive expansion
[24], which adds to the computational challenge.
The
same slow subdiﬀusion limits experimental studies with
condensates due to ﬁnite coherence times [25].
Treat-
ing inﬁnite particle numbers with mean-ﬁeld approxima-
tions results in nonlinear add-ons to the wave dynamics
which stem from the two-body interactions. Nonlinear
wave packet expansion was investigated both analyti-
cally and numerically over vast time scales [26–31]. It
allows to obtain the details of the subdiﬀusion process,
with expansion times which are many orders of magni-
tude larger than comparable experimental simulations
[32]. Remarkably, the subdiﬀusive expansion of a non-
linear wave packet appears to show no signatures of halt
[32]. Contrary, for quantum clouds with N particles we
expect the expansion to stop when the cloud reaches size
of the order of Nξ since each particle can occupy its own
localization volume ∼ξ and is only exponentially weakly
interacting with other particles.

Here we want to explore the long time wave packet ex-
pansion of an interacting many body cloud and to estab-
lish its slowing down from (sub)diﬀusion to a complete
halt. To achieve that challenging goal, we have to choose
proper platforms and approximations. We use a Floquet
platform of discrete time quantum walks which exhibit
AL [33]. Nonlinear add-ons show subdiﬀusive cloud ex-
pansion up to record large evolution times [34]. We fur-
ther adapt the use of a time-dependent ramping of the in-
teraction strength which allows to speed up subdiﬀusion
to normal diﬀusion [35]. Finally we quantize the actions
in the nonlinear add-ons similar to the Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization approach. As a result, we are able to sim-
ulate the cloud expansion for tens and hundreds of in-
teracting particles. We carefully choose the localization
length ξ and the number of interacting particles in order
to observe the slowing down and halt processes within
the accessible time window due to computational restric-
tions. We succeed in observing a slowing down of the ex-
pansion into a universal intermediate logarithmic growth
regime which connects the (sub)diﬀusion with the ﬁnal
saturation regime. We derive the anaytical details of this
novel logarithmic regime.
DTQW.— The single-particle linear discrete time
quantum walk (DTQW) is a Floquet evolution of a two-
level system {σ, ¯σ} on a chain. The system state at time
t + 1 follows from that at time t by the following unitary
map:
ψn,σ(t + 1) = cos θψn−1,σ(t) + eiφn−1(t) sin θψn−1,¯σ(t),
ψn,¯σ(t + 1) = −e−iφn+1(t) sin θψn+1,σ(t) + cos θψn+1,¯σ(t),
(1)
where n counts the lattice sites, and θ is the mixing an-
gle in the {σ, ¯σ} space which controls the kinetic energy
of an excitation [33].
The uncorrelated random onsite
disorder in the phase φn ≡ζn ∈[−π, π] results in An-
derson localization and controls the localization length
ξ = −[ln(cos θ)]−1 [33]. Note that ξ(θ →0) →∞and
ξ(θ →π/2) →0. DTQW were introduced as a quantum
version of classical random walks [36]. They serve as a

single particle version of a quantum cellular automaton
[37, 38]. DTQW became a useful tool to study various
systems and phenomena such as relativistic particles, ar-
tiﬁcial gauge ﬁelds [39, 40], various topological phases
[41–43], percolation problems [44, 45], localization phe-
nonema [46], and implementation of quantum informa-
tion tasks [47–49], among others. DTQW were imple-
mented experimentally using NMR devices [50], optical
devices [51, 52], in the IBM quantum computer [53], and
in a trapped ion quantum computer [54].
Nonlinearity was introduced in DTQW in a number of
publications [34, 55–59]. We follow Ref.[34] by making
the phase φn(t) a continuous function of the local norm
ρn(t) = |ψn,σ(t)|2 + |ψn,¯σ(t)|2:
φn = γρn + ζn .
(2)
Both linear and nonlinear DTQW preserve the total
norm A = P
n ρn.
We will evolve the DTQW start-
ing with one and the same localized initial condition
(ψn,σ(0), ψn,¯σ(0)) = δn,0(1, i)/
√
2 with A = 1. For γ = 0
the corresponding linear DTQW results in a short ex-
pansion and ﬁnal halt of the wave packet spreading due
to Anderson localization. Instead, for γ ̸= 0 the wave
packet continues its expansion beyond the limits set by
Anderson localization [34]. Its root mean square (rms)
r =

⟨n2⟩−⟨n⟩2 , ⟨nx⟩=

(3)
grows indeﬁnitely in a subdiﬀusive manner r(t) ∼t1/6
[34].
Ramping.— The subdiﬀusive expansion is a rather slow
process since it is characterized by a time-dependent dif-
fusion constant which is a function of the wave packet
norm density ρ ∼1/r: D ≡D(γρ) [60]. The density ρ
is decaying in time while the wave packet expands, thus
eﬀectively slowing down the diﬀusion. Since we intend
to observe the impact of a yet to be introduced quan-
tum slowing down correction, we are facing a challeng-
ing computational task. Remarkably, there is a reported
way to speed up the subdiﬀusive process by choosing a
proper ramping of the strength of nonlinear interaction
γ(t). Such a ramping intends to compensate for the de-
crease of the density ρ through a proper increase of the
interaction strength γ. That ramping can be in princi-
ple realized in experiments with ultracold atoms through
a time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld which controls the two-
body scattering length in a vicinity to Feshbach reso-
nances [61–64].
We follow the ramping protocol from
Ref. [35] and choose γ(t) = γtν:
φn(t) = γtνρn(t) + ζn .
(4)
In a one dimensional diﬀusive process for an initially lo-
calized wavepacket, its variance grows linearly in time:
r2 = Dt.
For the ramping case normal diﬀusion is
reached when D is constant (stationary) implying that

packets with ramping nonlinearity.

formed over 24 random disorder realizations.
the product (γtνρ) inside the wave packet stays approx-
imately constant. Since ρ ∼1/r and r ∼
√
t for nor-
mal diﬀusion, we conclude that the ramping exponent
ν = 1/2 ensures normal diﬀusion of the wave packet (see
also [35]). Further increase of the ramping exponent be-
yond 1/2 does not modify the obtained normal diﬀusion
[60].
Smaller ramping exponents gradually slow down
the spreading into subdiﬀusion. Our numerical results in
Fig. 1 conﬁrm the above considerations. For what follows
we will use ν = 1 and γ = 30.
Quantization.— We arrived at the ﬁnal and central
part of our complex evolution design which intends to
model a ﬁnite number of interacting quantum particles.
For that we quantize the density ρn using a step function
to arrive at
φn(t) = γtν
N ⌊Nρn(t)⌋+ ζn,
(5)
where ⌊Nρn(t)⌋is the largest possible integer less than
or equal to Nρn(t). The parameter N ≥1 serves as the
analog of the number of particles in a quantum many-
body system.
Note that the total number of particles
P
n Nρn(t) = N is conserved. For N →∞we recover the
continuous density dependence of the phase (4). The in-
set of Fig. 2 shows the computed dependence log r versus
log t for N = 24, γ = 30 and ν = 1 and a variety of dif-
ferent angles θ which control the single particle localiza-
tion length ξ = −[ln(cos θ)]−1. The wave packet initially
expands diﬀusively and shows clear signatures of satura-
tion and halt at larger evolution times. The rms value r
at saturation can be expected to be of the order of the
number of particles N times the volume of a one-particle
Anderson localized wave packet vl. That single particle
volume will depend on the localization length ξ and we
will assess these details further below. Interestingly the
inset in Fig. 2 appears to predict that the saturation and
halt will happen at earlier times the smaller the angle θ

and therefore the larger the localization length ξ. How-
ever, a replot of the same data with r on a linear scale in
the main part of Fig. 2 shows that what appeared to be a
saturation and halt on logarithmic rms scales, turns into
a logarithmic expansion regime of the quantized wave
packet:
r(t) = r0 + Dqn log10(t)
(6)
where r0 ∼tα is some cut-oﬀwhich stems from the earlier
normal diﬀusion.
The smaller θ and the larger ξ, the
earlier the logarithmic expansion set in, and the further
it extends in time. To further substantiate this ﬁnding,
we compute the local derivatives of the curves from the
main Fig. 2 and plot them in Fig.3.
We ﬁnd that all
derivatives show a plateau like structure in the regime
of logarithmic expansion, with slope value Dqn ≈20,
almost independently of θ and ξ.
Let us measure the
true saturation time Tf.
For that we ﬁnd the largest
slope position and value in Fig. 3. We then use the linear
ﬁt (6) and extend it to larger times until the rms reaches
the assumed ﬁnal localization volume Vloc. The read oﬀ
time is identiﬁed as Tf:
Tf = 10(Vloc−r0)/Dqn .
(7)
To estimate Vloc we assume that it is proportional to the
number of particles N and the single particle localization
volume vl ≈rl + 1 where rl ∼ξ is the saturated rms of a
single particle:
Vloc = Nf(rl + 1).
(8)
Note that the correction by one integer in (8) accounts for
the case of small localization length ξ ≪1 when rl ≪1
but the volume is approximately one lattice site. We plot
the value of rl as a function of θ in the inset of Fig.4. The
proportionality factor f can be assumed to be of order

one. To get a number, we use the data for θ = 0.45π in
Fig.2 to read oﬀVloc ≈70 and arrive at the value f ≈2
which we will use for all other curve analysis as well.
The outcome is shown by the blue (top) curve in Fig.4.
We ﬁnd that Tf(θ) is expected to have a minimum at
around θ = 0.45π, while it is growing substantially when
deviating to larger and smaller values of θ.
Derivation.— In order to explain the observed loga-
rithmic expansion and the subsequent halt, we assume
that the localization length ξ ≫1 and thus rl ≫1.
In order to enter the logarithmic expansion regime, the
wave packet density must be small such that at a given
time most of the wave packet sites the quantization con-
dition (5) yields one particle i.e. ⌊Nρ⌋= 0. Note that
at the same time r(t) > rl.
For a large time the dy-
namics in a localization volume vl will be following the
linear DTQW dynamics. The local norm on any of the
two levels in a two-level system will ﬂuctuate following an
exponential (Gibbs) distribution with chemical potential
µ = 2r. The ﬂuctuations are restricted to norm redis-
tributions within the ﬁnite volume vl ≈rl and have an

4
upper limit ρmax = crl/r(t) > 1/N with the constant c
being of order one and to be ﬁxed below. Then the norm
ρn on the entire two-level system will ﬂuctuate according
to the distribution
P(ρn) = µ2ρne−µρn , 0 ≤ρn ≤ρmax.
(9)
There is a small but ﬁnite probability ℘that 1/N < ρn <
ρmax:
℘(r) =
Z ρmax
1/N
Pdρn ≈e−2r/N −e−2crl .
(10)
The average time for that to happen is T ≈1/℘. Once
the rare event takes place, the quantized nonlinearity (5)
eﬀectively changes the disorder potential within the con-
sidered localization volume.
At the edge of the wave
packet, that leads to an expansion into a newly accessi-
ble localization volume:
dr
dt = rl℘(r) , r(t) = Ncrl + N
2 ln

1 −e−
2rlt
Ne2crl

.
(11)
It follows that r(t →∞) →Ncrl and with (8) we con-
clude c ≡f. We are now in position to obtain the loga-
rithmic expansion law, which is derived from (11):
r(t) = N
2 ln
2rl
N

+ N
2 ln (t) , t ≪Ne2frl
2rl
.
(12)
The logarithmic expansion is universal in the sense that
the slope N/2 depends only on the particle number, but
not on the particularities of the disorder, nonlinearity,
and ramping. In our numerical computations in Fig.3 we
used N = 24. The observed slope ≈20 was measured on
logarithmic time scales in base 10 and matches reason-
ably well with the theoretical prediction N
2 ln 10 = 27.6.
Finally we can attempt to estimate the saturation time
Tf from (11). For that we compute the time at which the
exponent in the rhs in (11) is of order one. The result
reads
Tf = Ne2frl
2rl
.
(13)
It follows that the saturation time diverges exponentially
with large rl in the limit of inﬁnite localization length
θ →0. At the same time the saturation time diverges
as 1/rl in the limit of small localization length θ →π/2.
Therefore there must be a minimum saturation time Tf
at some value of θ. The full dependence of Tf(θ) is plot-
ted in Fig.4. We ﬁnd that the minimum saturation time
is obtained for θ ≈0.48π which is reasonably close to the
numerically observed value ≈0.45π. Note that the ab-
solute values of the theoretical estimate of Tf are much
lower than the computational results. The reason is that
our theoretical approach is qualitative when it comes to
ﬁtting, and operates on logarithmic scales. Changing Vloc
from 70 to around 80 changes f from 2 to 2.3. Additional
replacement of rl by rl + 1 results in a magnitude shift
of Tf upwards by three orders of magnitude. Despite of
that qualitative character of the theory, it is capable to
reproduce the universal log law, and the minimum in Tf.
Conclusion.— Nonlinear wave packets spread subd-
iﬀusively in a disordered environment.
Despite many
eﬀorts to observe a slowing down of the subdiﬀusion,
all computational evidence points to unlimited subd-
iﬀusion.
Quantum systems with many particles and
conserved particle number were expected to be suﬃcient
for a slowing down from subdiﬀusion and ﬁnal halt of
spreading for ﬁnite particle numbers. In this work we
demonstrate this eﬀect using a rough action quantization
of a nonlinear wave propagation. To actually reach the
desired time scales, we chose highly eﬃcient unitary
maps (discrete time quantum walks) and nonlinear
interaction strength ramping for computational speed
up. We succeeded with observing the halt of expansion.
In addition, we discovered a novel intermediate logarith-
mic expansion regime whose time window grows with
increasing localization length. In that regime the wave
packet size growth speed on logarithmic time scales
depends only on the total particle number in the packet.
