THE “MODE OF THE ABSOLUTE” OF HEGEL
The engine is called the AbsoluteMode Engine, so named for Hegel. It’s impossible to really say with
certainty what Hegel really meant by the “mode of the Absolute” in his massive “Science of Logic”
since his writing was notoriously obfuscating.
A “mode” seems to be an instance of a mind – to start simply (like Spinoza described as part of a whole
reality of one integration into God). At this stage of Hegel’s ontology, we’ve reached the union of his
inner “essence” held by a mind and the outer reality of objects presented by “appearance.”
If we take some thought in a mind, it has an essentiality. If we then consider the world external to mind,
delivered by its “appearance,” we have a linkage to the “actual” through a substrate. The actual can
only exist as a union of inner and outer (essence and appearance respectively). It takes both. But
importantly, Hegel probably meant that a single essence inflitrates all inner and outer and gives us
actual, the entirety a single essence.
The absolute mode (kind of an extended mind) seems to mean the substrate necessary for linking inner
essence and outer appearance. The absolute is that which is able to combine the inner, outer, and result
in a union, the actual. Nothing is actual unless there is both an inner essence and outer existence. There
is a substrate necessary to bridge the divide: the mode of the absolute.
Think of the absolute as akin to an absolute number which can take on more than one actual value. But
the absolute is like an absolute concept, not an absolute number, which can itself take on more than one
concept, in fact any concept possible, and joins essence and appearance in a mode. The mode of the
absolute is then the basis for anything actual.
