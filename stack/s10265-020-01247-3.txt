Abstract
Plant organs are repetitively generated at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in recognizable patterns. This phenomenon, known 
as phyllotaxis, has long fascinated scientists from different disciplines. While we have an enriched body of knowledge on 
phyllotactic patterns, parameters, and transitions, only in the past 20 years, however, have we started to identify genes and 
elucidate genetic pathways that involved in phyllotaxis. In this review, I first summarize the classical knowledge of phyllotaxis 
from a morphological perspective. I then discuss recent advances in the regulation of phyllotaxis, from a molecular genetics 
perspective. I show that the morphological beauty of phyllotaxis we appreciate is the manifestation of many regulators, in 
addition to the critical role of auxin as a patterning signal, exerting their respective effects in a coordinated fashion either 
directly or indirectly in the SAM.

Introduction
Phyllotaxis (phyllotaxy) is the arrangement of repeated 
plant organs. The word “phyllotaxis” itself was coined by 
Carl Friedrich Schimper (1830), a botanist and naturalist 
from Mannheim, Germany. It is a combination of two Greek 
words: phullon (leaf) and taxis (arrangement). In a narrow 
sense, it is the arrangement of vegetative leaves on a stem 
(Fig. 1a). In a broad sense, it extends to the arrangement of 
floral organs of a flower (Fig. 1b), flowers of an inflorescence 
(Fig. 1c), and in extreme cases, inflorescences of a capitules-
cence (Fig. 1d). It is one of the oldest research fields in the 
history of plant morphology (Adler et al. 1997). The strik-
ing eye-catching phyllotactic patterns, especially Fibonacci 
patterns, have fascinated not only botanists (Hofmeister 
1868), but also crystallographers (Bravais and Bravais 
1837), mathematicians (Jean 1994), physicists (Douady and 
Couder 1992, 1998), modelers (Mitchison 1977), computer 
scientists (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer 1990), and even 
artists (Fig. 2).
Phyllotaxis is mainly studied from the shoot apical mer-
istem (SAM) (Church 1904; Van Iterson 1907), where all 
phyllotactic patterns are generated. Phyllotactic patterns, in 
terms of the geometry of the SAM and the spacing of pri-
mordia, can be quantitatively described using various param-
eters (Richards 1948, 1951). Quantitative approaches yield 
meaningful results to understand the correlations among var-
ious parameters in different taxa (Rutishauser 1998). Efforts 
to answer the question of how phyllotactic patterns arise 
date back to about 150 years ago when Hofmeister (1868) 
postulated that a new primordium is formed farthest from 
existing ones. This postulate, known as the “Hofmeister 
rule”, tested by a series of pioneering experiments (Snow 
and Snow 1931, 1933, 1935), has been elaborated as the 
“first available space” theory, which states that a new pri-
mordium is formed whenever a minimum space becomes 
available (Snow and Snow 1947).
Pioneering models of phyllotaxis can be loosely catego-
rized into geometrical, biochemical, and biomechanical. 
In geometrical models, a single geometrical parameter, 
such as the relative size difference between the SAM and 
primordia, accounts for phyllotaxis (Douady and Couder 
1996a, b, c, 1998). In biochemical models (Chapman and

1952; Veen and Lindenmayer 1977; Wardlaw 1949; 
Young 1978), a diffusible morphogen, which is produced 
by existing primordia and creates an inhibitory field to 
prevent new primordia from forming in their vicinity, or 
the depletion of an activator, accounts for phyllotaxis. In 
biomechanical models (Adler 1974; Green 1992, 1999; 
Green et al. 1996; Hernandez and Green 1993; Shipman 
and Newell 2005; Williams 1975), tension or compres-
sion generated from existing primordia at the tissue level 
account for phyllotaxis. It is important to note that these 
models are not contradictory. For example, geometrical 
models (Douady and Couder 1996a, b, c, 1998) could also 
be biochemical or biomechanical models, depending on 
how the inhibition domain of primordia is regulated. A 
comprehensive analysis of pioneering and recent models 
of phyllotaxis has been highlighted by Barabé and Lacroix 
(2020) and the history of phyllotaxis has been described 
by Adler et al. (1997), Jean (1994), and Okabe (2016).
With the beginning of the twenty-first century, a new 
trend arose in phyllotaxis research. Instead of using 
quantitative approaches such as measuring phyllotactic 
parameters, more and more studies have focused on char-
acterizing genes and genetic pathways that play a role in 
phyllotaxis using molecular genetics. Compelling evidence 
pinpoints the central role of the phytohormone auxin in 
phyllotaxis. With new methods such as confocal micros-
copy, live imaging, computer simulations and the charac-
terization of model species such as Arabidopsis [Arabidop-
sis thaliana (L.) Heynh.], we have gained an ever-growing 
understanding of the detailed mechanisms determining 
phyllotaxis.
In the first part of this review, I summarize the classi-
cal knowledge of phyllotaxis including phyllotactic pat-
terns and parameters, phyllotactic pattern transitions and 
diversity. In the second part, I discuss recent advances in 
molecular genetics studies on where (divergence angle) 
and when (plastochron and plastochron ratio) a primor-
dium is initiated on the SAM, and how phyllotaxis can 
be affected or modified by SAM geometry and organiza-
tion, non-cell-autonomous signals from developing pri-
mordia, cell wall mechanics, and post SAM growth. In 
particular, I focus on those genes and genetic pathways

trol phyllotaxis.
Phyllotactic patterns and parameters
Phyllotactic patterns
In general, phyllotactic patterns can be categorized as: spi-
ral, whorled, and distichous. The easiest way to identify a 
spiral pattern is to count the number of “spirals” winding 
in opposite directions around the SAM. These spirals are 
called parastichies (Braun 1835; Fig. 3a) and the parastichy 
numbers (m, n) with m < n are used to designate spiral pat-
terns. Parastichies which wind in opposite directions and 
intersect at an angle (γ) close to 90° are easily recognized 
visually. Adjacent organs along a parastichy are of m or n 
plastochron (the absolute time interval between the initia-
tion of two successive organs) age difference. Interestingly, 
integers m and n are successive numbers of a mathematical 
series with a simple additive rule, where one number is the 
sum of two previous numbers and the two starting numbers 
are fixed. The Fibonacci series < 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… > has 
the starting numbers 1 and 1. Other series in the format < 1, 
t, t + 1, 2t + 1, 3t + 2, 5t + 3… > (t ≥ 3) are called acces-
sory series. When t = 3, the first accessory series (Lucas

series) < 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18… > is deduced with the same add-
ing rule. Other series whose first number is not 1 are called 
anomalous series (Jean 1994).
Whorled patterns are designated as (m, n) with m = n, or 
simply as j(1, 1), where j is jugacity, the number of organs 
per node. Instead of parastichies, whorled patterns have 
orthostichies (Fig. 3b), vertical “lines” formed by organs 
from every other node. The 2(1, 1) pattern, commonly 
known as the decussate pattern, has two organs per node 
and four orthostichies. Instead of alternating whorls, organs 
of one node can also be directly superposed to organs of the 
next node. Such superposition of whorls is common in acacia 
(Acacia spp.) phyllodes (Rutishauser 1999, 2016) and some 
flowers such as Malabar spinach (Basella rubra L.) (Lacroix 
and Sattler 1988). The distichous pattern (Fig. 3c) has one 
organ per node, and successive organs have a divergence 
angle (discussed next) of 180°. This pattern, designated as 
(1, 1), could be treated as the intermediate between spiral 
patterns and whorled patterns. On the one hand, it could be 
considered as a spiral pattern that has the two starting num-
bers of the Fibonacci series, 1 and 1. On the other hand, it 
could also be considered as a whorled pattern that has the 
lowest possible jugacity, 1 (Green et al. 1998). Combina-
tions of spiral and whorled patterns are sometimes observed. 
These patterns are designated as j(m, n) with (m < n).
Phyllotactic parameters
Among various phyllotactic parameters used in quantitative 
approaches, divergence angle (d) is the most important one. 
It is the angle formed by two successive organs measured 
from the center of the SAM (Schimper 1830; Fig. 4a). All 
phyllotactic patterns within a series have the same theoreti-
cal divergence angle, and it is unique for each series. For a 
pattern j(m, n) with m < n where m and n are within the 
series < 1, t, t + 1, 2t + 1, 3t + 2, 5t + 3… > (t = 2 for Fibo-
nacci series), the theoretical divergence angle is d =
360◦
j(t+휑−1) , 
where φ is the golden ratio 
√
5+1
2  (Jean 1994). Fibonacci pat-
terns have a theoretical divergence angle of 137.5°, the so 
called “Golden Angle”. Nonetheless, empirically, a series of 
divergence angles on a single SAM often fluctuates around 
the theoretical divergence angle (Barabé et al. 2010; Yin and 
Meicenheimer 2017a). The fluctuation range is correlated to 
the parastichy numbers (m, n). The greater the parastichy 
numbers, the smaller the fluctuation range (Jean 1994).
Divergence angle describes the relative positioning of 
two successive organs in terms of space. Another param-
eter, plastochron ratio (R) [spelled as “plastochrone” in 
the original publication (Richards 1948)], describes the 
relative positioning of two successive organs in terms of 
rate. While plastochron itself is the absolute time inter-
val between the initiation of two successive organs, plas-
tochron ratio is calculated as the ratio of the distances from 
two successive organs to the center of the SAM (Richards 
1948; Fig. 4a). The lower the plastochron ratio, the more 
frequent the initiation of plant organs on the SAM. One use-
ful derivative of plastochron ratio is the phyllotaxis index, 
PI = 0.379 −2.3925 log10log10R (Richards 1951). The two 
constants listed in this equation are used specifically for 
Fibonacci patterns, so that PI values close to successive 
natural numbers can be derived (especially when R is close 
to 1). Successive natural numbers correspond to successive 
Fibonacci patterns. For example, a PI value of 1 corresponds

to the (1, 2) pattern and 2 corresponds to the (2, 3) pattern 
and so on.
Divergence angle and plastochron ratio quantitatively 
describe the positioning of two successive organs. Another 
class of parameters, in contrast, describes the relative size 
difference between the SAM and primordia. Among these 
parameters, the most useful is 훤= d0
R0 , where d0 is the diam-
eter of the youngest organ upon initiation and R0 is the radius 
of the SAM (Douady and Couder 1996b; Fig. 4b). In prac-
tice, d0 can be substituted by lt, the tangential length of the 
youngest organ upon initiation (Yin and Meicenheimer 
2017a; Fig. 4b). Using parameter Γ alone, the majority of 
phyllotactic patterns can be generated in a geometrical 
model (Douady and Couder 1996b). In addition, by intro-
ducing age-dependent changes to parameter Γ, a periodic 
oscillation in divergence angle such as 90°, 180°, 270° 
(− 90°), and 180° as exhibited by Orixa japonica Thunb. can 
be successively generated (Yonekura et al. 2019).
Since the SAM is typically a dome-shaped structure, 
phyllotaxis, in essence, is a three-dimensional phenomenon. 
Half conic angle (ψ/2) describes the vertical dimension of 
the SAM and represents half of the angle of the cone that is 
tangent to the shoot apex at the level of the youngest organ 
upon initiation (Douady and Couder 1996b; Fig. 4c). Half 
conic angle is often hard to measure directly due to technical 
difficulties. Nonetheless, it can be calculated indirectly as 
ψ/2 = arcsin (lr/lt), where lr and lt are the radial and tangential 
length of the youngest organ upon initiation, respectively 
(Douady and Couder 1996b; Fig. 4b). Half conic angle is 
thought to be correlated with phyllotactic patterns. It was 
demonstrated that in aquatic plants, distichous, spiral, and 
decussate patterns tend to have a large value of half conic 
angle, indicating a flatter SAM, whereas other whorled 
patterns tend to have a small half conic angle, indicating 
a rounder or more convex SAM (Kelly and Cooke 2003).
Phyllotactic parameters are empirically correlated (Rut-
ishauser 1998). For example, a pattern with a small plas-
tochron ratio value usually has a small parameter Γ value 
as well. More importantly, phyllotactic parameters are also 
theoretically related. For example, if we know the value of 
two or three of the following parameters: parastichy numbers 
(m, n), their angle of intersection (γ), divergence angle (d), 
and plastochron ratio (R), the value (or the range of val-
ues) of other parameters can be deduced (Jean 1994). This 
correlation can be used to accurately define a phyllotactic 
pattern, especially for a non-Fibonacci spiral pattern. One 
notable example is Costus cylindricus Jacq., which has a low 
divergence angle around 47.7° in its aerial stems, forming a 
pattern that was for a long time referred to as “spiromonos-
tichous” (Kirchoff and Rutishauser 1990; Snow 1952). Using 
theoretical relationships among phyllotactic parameters, 
this pattern exhibited by C. cylindricus could be accurately 
defined as the (7, 8) pattern, which has a theoretical diver-
gence angle of 47.26° (Jean 1994).
Phyllotactic pattern transitions
During the ontogeny of some plants, phyllotactic pattern 
transitions often occur (Williams 1975; Zagórska-Marek 
1987). Two types of transitions are recognized: continuous 
and discontinuous (Meicenheimer and Zagórska-Marek 
1989; Zagórska-Marek 1987). In continuous transitions, 
phyllotactic patterns before and after the transition are 
within the same series (Jean and Barabé 2001). In discon-
tinuous transitions, phyllotactic patterns before and after the 
transition belong to different series or jugacities (Jean and 
Barabé 2001).
Continuous transitions
Continuous transitions are thought to occur via sym-
metrical or uniform changes in the SAM (Meicenheimer 
and Zagórska-Marek 1989). As a result, divergence angle 
remains unchanged before and after a continuous transi-
tion, whereas plastochron, plastochron ratio, and parameter 
Γ often change. One exception, due to the special property 
of the distichous pattern, is a transition from the (1, 1) pat-
tern, which has a divergence angle of 180°, to the (1, 2) 
pattern, which has a divergence angle of 137.5°, within the 
Fibonacci series. Continuous transitions can occur naturally 
(Gola 1997; Larson 1977; Meicenheimer 1979, 1982, 1987; 
Williams 1975) and also be chemically induced (Maksy-
mowych and Erickson 1977; Maksymowych et al. 1976; 
Marc and Hackett 1991, 1992; Rogler and Hackett 1975; 
Schwabe 1971). Gibberellic acid ­(GA3) treatment of Xan-
thium pennsylvanicum Wallr. can induce a transition from 
the (2, 3) pattern to the (3, 5) pattern (Maksymowych and 
Erickson 1977; Maksymowych et al. 1976), which can also 
be triggered by short-day photoperiods that induce flowering 
(Erickson and Meicenheimer 1977). Similarly, ­GA3 treat-
ment of Hedera helix L. (Marc and Hackett 1991, 1992; 
Rogler and Hackett 1975) and triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA, 
a polar auxin transport inhibitor) treatment of Chrysanthe-
mum (Schwabe 1971) can induce transitions from low-order 
Fibonacci patterns to the (1, 1) pattern.
Discontinuous transitions
Discontinuous transitions are thought to occur via asymmet-
rical or sectorial changes in the SAM (Meicenheimer 1998; 
Meicenheimer and Zagórska-Marek 1989) or bifurcation 
(dichotomy) of the SAM (Gola 1997; Yin and Meicenheimer 
2017a, b; Zagórska-Marek 1985). As a result, divergence 
angle changes abruptly, whereas plastochron, plastochron

ratio, and parameter Γ often remain unchanged before and 
after a discontinuous transition (Yin and Meicenheimer 
2017a; Yin et al. 2011). Discontinuous transitions can occur 
naturally (Gola 1996, 1997; Kwiatkowska, 1995; Meicen-
heimer 1979, 1982, 1987; Szymanowska-Pułka 1994; Yin 
and Meicenheimer 2017a; Yin et al. 2011; Zagórska-Marek 
1985, 1987, 1994) and also be surgically (Snow and Snow 
1935; Soma 1958) and chemically (Meicenheimer 1981; 
Mingo-Castel et al. 1984; Snow and Snow 1937) induced. 
In a classic experiment, a vertical diagonal cut on the SAM 
of Epilobium hirsutum L. can induce a stable transition from 
the decussate pattern to the spiral pattern (Snow and Snow 
1935). The nature of this cutting experiment is somewhat 
similar to bifurcation of the SAM, which can lead to a vari-
ety of discontinuous transitions in lower vascular plants 
(Yin and Meicenheimer 2017a) and gymnosperms (Zagór-
ska-Marek 1985). The same transition in E. hirsutum can 
also be induced by auxin treatment (Snow and Snow 1937), 
N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA, a polar auxin transport 
inhibitor) and α-4-chlorophenoxysobutyric (CPIB, an auxin 
antagonist) treatment (Meicenheimer 1981). Similarly, ben-
zyladenine (BA) and ­GA3 treatment of Euphorbia lathyris 
L. can induce transitions from the decussate pattern to the 
spiral, tricussate, and tetracussate patterns (Mingo-Castel 
1984).
Phyllotactic pattern diversity
The amazing diversity of phyllotactic patterns, both inter- 
and intra-specific, has been recognized for a long time 
(Fujita 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942; Kwiatkowska 1997) and 
was comprehensively surveyed by Jean (1994) and Gola and 
Banasiak (2016). One popular example is the inflorescence 
(capitulum) of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (Swinton 
et al. 2016; Fig. 2). Despite the diversity, one outstanding 
question is why Fibonacci patterns are relatively frequent, 
while other patterns such as the decussate pattern are rela-
tively rare? Functional explanations include that Fibonacci 
patterns maximize packing efficiency of primordia in the 
bud (Airy 1873) or maximize light capture efficiency (Airy 
1873; Wiesner 1875). While light does play a role in phyl-
lotaxis (Yoshida et al. 2011), recent numerical simulations 
reveal that light-capture efficiency is influenced by a suite 
of morphological characters; and Fibonacci patterns (or 
any pattern) are not under selective pressure (Strauss et al. 
2020; Valladares and Brites 2004). Thus, phyllotactic pat-
tern diversity provides an excellent example of morphologi-
cal variations in plants that cannot be explained by natural 
selection (Rutishauser 2019), as noted almost 150 years ago 
by Darwin (1872).
To address this outstanding question about the predomi-
nance of Fibonacci patterns, Jean (1994) formulated an 
interpretive model using an entropy-like approach. While 
models that are based on molecular and/or biomechani-
cal players can satisfactorily simulate phyllotactic pat-
terns (usually a Fibonacci pattern), Jean’s model offers a 
solution to explain different frequencies of different pat-
terns observed in nature. Using the Lestiboudois–Bolle 
law of duplication (Bolle 1939; Lestiboudois 1848), Jean 
(1994) considered each phyllotactic pattern as a pyramid-
shaped hierarchical structure that has only single and dou-
ble (duplication) nodes within a certain number of levels 
(Fig. 5). The number of nodes at the bottom level and the 
second to the bottom level are n, m for the pattern (m, n), 
with m ≤ n, respectively. Based on these two levels, and the 
Lestiboudois-Bolle law (Bolle 1939; Lestiboudois 1848), 
the structure of the entire hierarchy (phyllotactic pattern) 
can be deduced (Fig. 5) (Jean 1994). For each phyllotactic 
pattern (now represented as a unique hierarchical struc-
ture), its bulk energy (Eb, the “cost” to “create” such a 
hierarchical structure) can be calculated by the stability 
Fig. 5   Phyllotactic pattern (m, 
n) as a pyramid-shaped hierar-
chical structure. In this example, 
the hierarchical structure of the 
(8, 13) pattern is exhibited. The 
sequence of numbers of each 
level follows the projected posi-
tions of the n youngest organs 
from an unrolled cylinder. In 
each level, a number i (m < i ≤ n, 
marked in red) and its neighbor 
(i − m) form a double node in 
the next level. These numbers 
are eliminated in the next level

1 3
and the complexity of its levels. Different phyllotactic pat-
terns can then be ordered according to their respective Eb 
value. It is assumed that the larger the Eb value, the smaller 
the probability of existence of a particular pattern. Based 
on the prediction made by this model and compiled data 
from the literature, it is concluded that among all phyl-
lotactic patterns observed in nature, Fibonacci patterns 
predominate (92%), followed by the decussate pattern 
(6%), Lucas patterns (1.5%), and all other patterns (0.5%) 
(Jean 1994).
Nonetheless, despite the general applicability of this 
entropy-like model, it should be noted that the frequency 
of phyllotactic patterns depends on the taxonomic rank 
(species, genus, family, etc.) used for data collection. 
Exceptions exist especially at the intra-specific level such 
as cones of Pinus nigra Arn. and Larix decidua Mill. 
(Fierz 2015). Notably, some plants have an “altered” pat-
tern frequency and a “wild” pattern spectrum such that 
they deviate from the model prediction. In shoots of 
Diphasiastrum digitatum (Dill. ex A. Braun) Holub (Yin 
and Meicenheimer 2017a), Huperzia lucidula (Michx.) 
Trevis. (Stevenson 1976), Lycopodium annotinum L. and 
L. clavatum L. (Gola 1996), common patterns are in the 
form of (m, m + 1) and j(1, 1), where m and j range from 
4 to as high as 11. The SAM of this group of lower vascu-
lar plants has frequent and various bifurcations (Yin and 
Meicenheimer 2017b). Although rarely, SAM bifurcation 
can also occur and result in a “wild” pattern spectrum in 
gymnosperms (Zagórska-Marek 1985) and angiosperms 
(Gola 1997). In flowers of Magnolia acuminata (L.) L., 
anomalous patterns such as the (2, 7) pattern, the (3, 7) 
pattern, the (3, 8) pattern, and the (5, 7) pattern are com-
mon (Zagórska-Marek 1994). Notably, the (3, 7) pattern 
and the (3, 8) pattern are considered theoretically impos-
sible according to Jean’s (1994) model. In M. acuminata, 
the floral meristem has a stochastic character in terms of 
circumference and floral primordia are relatively small 
(small parameter Γ) (Zagórska-Marek 1994). In flowers 
of Drimys winteri J. R. Forst. & G. Forst., Lucas patterns 
and other patterns such as the (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 2(3, 
4), and 3(2,3) pattern are common (Doust 2001). In D. 
winteri, the shape of the floral meristem is elliptical due 
to strong compression forces from the subtending bract 
(Doust 2001). In capitula of Carlina acaulis L., although 
Fibonacci patterns still predominate, very rare patterns 
such as (2, 17), (4, 11), (7, 37), 2(8, 9), 2(5, 11), and 8(2, 
3) can occur (Szymanowska-Pułka 1994). In C. acaulis, 
the shape of the capitulum disk is irregular, ranging from 
circular to elongated due to different degrees of fascia-
tion (Szymanowska-Pułka 1994). These exceptions at the 
vegetative, floral, and inflorescence levels indicate that the 
shape of the SAM is a major determinant of phyllotactic 
pattern diversity.
A matter of where: an auxin positive 
feedback loop determines divergence angle
In the preceding sections, phyllotactic parameters (diver-
gence angle, plastochron, plastochron ratio, parameter Γ, 
and half conic angle) were introduced, and their changes 
during phyllotactic transitions were discussed. A linkage 
between the diversity in phyllotactic pattern and variation 
in the size and the shape of the SAM was also introduced. 
Although much empirical data on phyllotactic param-
eters has accumulated over the years, only recently have 
we started to understand how these parameters are regu-
lated. Genes associated with phyllotactic parameters were 
recently tabulated by Barabé and Lacroix (2020). In the 
following sections, recent advances in the molecular and 
genetic regulation of divergence angle, plastochron and 
plastochron ratio will be discussed, and the effect of other 
factors such as properties of the SAM that can alter phyl-
lotaxis will be introduced.
A positive feedback loop from auxin to its polar 
transport
We have long known that the position of a new primor-
dium depends on existing ones (Snow and Snow 1931) and 
that auxin is involved in primordia initiation (Meicenhe-
imer 1981; Schwabe 1971; Snow and Snow 1937; Wardlaw 
1957; Wardlaw and Mitra 1958). One direct evidence that 
auxin and its polar transport play an important role in 
phyllotaxis comes from Arabidopsis pin-formed1 (pin1) 
mutant, whose inflorescence has no flowers and becomes 
a naked “pin” (Fig. 6a) due to reduced polar auxin trans-
port (Okada et al. 1991). Application of polar auxin trans-
port inhibitors, but not auxin antagonists, to the wild type 
inflorescence results in the same phenotype (Okada et al. 
1991). In addition, application of exogenous auxin to pin1 
inflorescence restores flower formation (Reinhardt et al. 
2000, 2003). Similarly, in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum 
L.), polar auxin transport inhibitors block leaf formation 
on the vegetative SAM, and leaf formation is restored 
exclusively at the site of exogenous auxin application on 
the naked SAM soon after the application (Reinhardt et al. 
2000).
PIN1 encodes a plasma membrane localized auxin 
efflux carrier (Galweiler et  al. 1998). In vegetative 
SAM and inflorescence meristem of Arabidopsis, PIN1 is 
primarily localized in the plasma membrane of cells in the 
epidermal layer ­(L1) that faces the incipient and young pri-
mordia (Reinhardt et al. 2003; Fig. 6b). It is also localized 
in the plasma membrane of the inner cells (2–3 cell layers) 
that face the top of the SAM, at lower levels (Reinhardt 

381

1 3
et al. 2003). From this localization pattern, it is inferred 
that auxin is primarily transported against its own gradient 
in ­L1 of the SAM toward the incipient primordium and is 
depleted in the vicinity of the incipient primordium (Rein-
hardt et al. 2003; de Reuille et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2006). 
This spatiotemporal auxin distribution pattern was con-
firmed by monitoring DII-VENUS, a synthetic protein that 
is degraded in response to auxin (Galvan-Ampudia et al. 
2020; Vernoux et al. 2011; Fig. 6c). From these pieces of 
evidence, a conceptual model of phyllotaxis was proposed: 
Auxin is transported acropetally toward the SAM (Fig. 6e), 
where it is concentrated by existing primordia, which act 
as auxin sinks and redistribute auxin, a dynamic process 
governed by polarized PIN1. As a result, auxin maxima 
regularly form at sites away from existing primordia and 
trigger primordia initiation (Reinhardt 2005; Reinhardt 
et al. 2003; Fig. 6f). Therefore, instead of a diffusible mor-
phogen as proposed by pioneering biochemical models, 
the depletion of an activator, i.e., auxin, near existing pri-
mordia, forms an inhibitory field that prevents the initia-
tion of a new primordium. Notably, a computer simulation 
of this conceptual model can successfully generate most 
phyllotactic patterns de novo (Smith et al. 2006; Fig. 6d). 
In contrast, Galvan-Ampudia et al. (2020) recently visual-
ized the spatiotemporal distribution of auxin using high-
resolution imaging and reported that auxin maxima repeti-
tively form at the periphery of the SAM in a finger-like 
pattern extending from a permanent zone of high auxin at 
the center of the SAM, and that PIN1 is polarized toward 
the center of the SAM and the “fingers” to guide such 
auxin distribution pattern.
Regardless, auxin transport against its own gradient is 
governed by polarized PIN1. How, then, is PIN1 polarized? 
At the cellular level, proper PIN1 trafficking and subcellular 
localization requires phosphorylation of its M3 site by the 
kinase PINOID (PID) (Friml et al. 2004; Ki et al. 2016). At

the tissular level, however, the mechanism seems to be more 
complicated, and two hypotheses have been proposed. The 
auxin-based hypothesis states that PIN1 in a cell is polarized 
toward the neighboring cell that has the highest auxin con-
centration. The flux-based hypothesis states that the abun-
dance of PIN1 in a plasma membrane is proportional to the 
rate of auxin efflux through that membrane. Although dif-
ferent models support the auxin-based hypothesis (Jonsson 
et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2006) and the flux-based hypothesis 
(Abley et al. 2016; Stoma et al. 2008), experimental evi-
dence supporting either hypothesis is relatively scarce.
Several studies supporting the auxin-based hypothesis 
highlight the important role of auxin signaling via the 
transcription factor auxin response factor5/monopteros 
(ARF5/MP) as a key component of an auxin positive feed-
back loop (Bhatia et al. 2016; Garrett et al. 2012; Krogan 
et al. 2016). In the inflorescence meristem of wild type 
Arabidopsis, MP activity follows the spatiotemporal auxin 
distribution pattern (Bhatia et al. 2016). Using a clonal 
mosaic approach, Bhatia et al. (2016) showed that induced 
MP activity in mp mutant is necessary and sufficient to polar-
ize PIN1 in surrounding cells toward MP-expressing cells 
non-cell-autonomously. In mp inflorescence, which is also 
pin-like and cannot be rescued by exogenous auxin applica-
tion (Przemeck et al. 1996; Reinhardt et al. 2003), PIN1 
localization becomes uniform across the SAM (Bhatia et al. 
2016; Reinhardt et al. 2003). Moreover, MP directly binds 
to the PIN1 promoter and activates its expression (Krogan 
et al. 2016). In line with this, a semi-dominant MP gain-of-
function allele, mpabn, causes ectopic PIN1 expression and 
alters floral phyllotaxis from its typical spiral pattern to the 
decussate pattern (Garrett et al. 2012). Conversely, a disrup-
tion of MP-mediated auxin signaling or the auxin positive 
feedback loop can disturb the positioning of auxin maxima 
and organ initiation in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa 
L.) (Fal et al. 2017; Moss et al., 2015; Yoshida et al. 2012).
In addition to genetic factors, recent studies also sug-
gest that cell wall and mechanical signals play an important 
role in instructing PIN1 polarity (Feraru et al. 2011). PIN1 
preferentially localizes to the cell wall parallel to cortical 
microtubule orientation (Heisler et al. 2010), which can be 
considered as a readout of cell principal mechanical stress 
(Hamant et al. 2008). Mechanical manipulations using laser 
ablation or drug treatment revealed that PIN1 localization 
responds to changes in local mechanical stress (Heisler et al. 
2010). Such PIN1 re-localization requires PIN1 exocytosis 
and endocytosis at the cellular level (Nakayama et al. 2012) 
and a transient change in ­Ca2+ concentration in the SAM 
at the tissular level (Li et al. 2019). Based on the rule that 
PIN1 polarizes toward the mechanically more stressed cell, a 
computer model can successively generate phyllotactic pat-
terns and recapitulate the process of PIN1 re-localization 
after mechanical manipulations (Heisler et al. 2010). Since 
one source of mechanical signals is cell expansion triggered 
by auxin, another layer of complexity is added to the auxin 
positive feedback loop (Braybrook and Peaucelle 2013; 
Heisler et al. 2010; Nakayama et al. 2012).
Distinct and coordinated modes of PIN1 polarization 
in ­L1 and provascular cells
It is important to note that the auxin-based hypothesis and 
the flux-based hypothesis are not contradictory. They can 
function coordinately during organ initiation and subsequent 
midvein formation (Bayer et al. 2009; Hartmann et al. 2019). 
According to a two-dimensional (Bayer et al 2009) and a 
three-dimensional (Hartmann et al. 2019) integrated model, 
auxin-based PIN1 polarization dominates in ­L1 of the SAM 
to trigger the initiation of new primordia. As new primordia 
emerge, cells at auxin maxima change to basal PIN1 locali-
zation, directing basipetal auxin flow to a strand of provas-
cular cells to initiate midvein formation. In these cells, flux-
based PIN1 localization orients PIN1 basally. In neighboring 
cells, auxin-based PIN1 localization orients PIN1 laterally 
toward provascular cells. As discussed next, several studies 
directly or indirectly support integrated models.
Direct evidence comes from Brachypodium distachyon 
(L.) P. Beauv, which has PIN genes from distinct clades 
functioning in ­L1 and provascular cells of the inflorescence 
spikelet meristem (O’Connor et al. 2014, 2017). In B. dis-
tachyon, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which belongs to a lost 
clade in Brassicaceae including Arabidopsis, functions in 
­L1 of the inflorescence spikelet meristem to create auxin 
maxima, whereas two duplicated genes that belong to the 
PIN1 clade function in provascular cells of the inflorescence 
spikelet meristem to initiate midvein formation (O’Connor 
et al. 2014, 2017). Along the same line, in tomato, SlSoPIN1 
guides auxin maxima formation in ­L1 of the vegetative SAM, 
and slsopin1 mutant cannot properly converge auxin in ­L1. 
As a result, slsopin1 has an unstable divergence angle, 
alternating between 180° and 90° (Martinez et al. 2016). 
Indirect evidence comes from Arabidopsis macchi-bou4 
(mab4) mab4-like1 (mel1) mel2 triple mutant. MAB4, MEL1, 
and MEL2, which encode NPH3-family proteins and regu-
late PIN1 endocytosis (Furutani et al. 2007, 2014), enable 
basal PIN1 localization in cells at auxin maxima in ­L1 of 
the inflorescence meristem and establish basipetal flow of 
auxin (Furutani et al. 2014). In mab4 mel1 mel2, auxin only 
accumulates in ­L1 of the inflorescence meristem but is not 
directed to provascular cells; consequently, flower formation 
is not triggered (Furutani et al. 2014). Additional indirect 
evidence comes from Arabidopsis erecta (er) erecta-like1 
(erl1) erl2 triple mutant. ER, ERL1, and ERL2, which encode 
leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and 
function in intercellular communication (Torii et al. 1996), 
affect phyllotaxis pleiotropically (discussed in Sections “A

matter of when: multiple factors determine plastochron and 
plastochron ratio” and “SAM geometry and organization 
as important regulators of phyllotaxis”) (Chen et al. 2013). 
One phenotype of er erl1 erl2 is that its PIN1 is localized 
more broadly and uniformly in both ­L1 and inner cells (2–3 
cell layers) of the vegetative SAM (Chen et al. 2013). As a 
result, the overall auxin level is high throughout ­L1; so no 
auxin maxima are formed there, nor is auxin concentrated 
in provascular cells, although leaves (and flowers) can still 
form with divergence angles deviating greatly from 137.5° 
(Chen et al. 2013).
Inner cells: an integral part of the SAM 
for stabilizing auxin maxima
While auxin is primarily transported through ­L1 of the SAM 
and the expression of PIN1 only in ­L1 is sufficient to main-
tain phyllotaxis in Arabidopsis (Kierzkowski et al. 2013), the 
finding that provascular cells have a different PIN1 polari-
zation mechanism raises the notion that inner cells of the 
SAM play an equally important role, which is supported by 
a few more pieces of evidence. First, PIN1 in the inner cells 
of the SAM facilitates auxin retention within ­L1 cells (Kier-
zkowski et al. 2013). Second, ablation of only provascular 
cells of emerging primordia of tomato using femtosecond 
laser pulses causes a transient, excessive accumulation of 
auxin in the future midvein region (Deb et al. 2015). As a 
result, the position of the next two primordia become less 
predictable, and hence, the divergence angle of the next 
two plastochrons becomes more variable (Deb et al. 2015). 
Third, when induced MP activity is restricted to ­L1 in the 
inflorescence meristem of mp, auxin maxima can still form, 
but somehow shift circumferentially over time, indicating 
that MP is also required in inner cells of the SAM to anchor 
auxin maxima (Bhatia et al. 2016).
Auxin influx: an important process to retain auxin 
within ­L1 cells
Auxin is a small molecule that can easily diffuse between 
cells. Therefore, while the auxin positive feedback loop drives 
the formation of regularly spaced auxin maxima, auxin must 
be retained within ­L1 cells and prevented from diffusing. 
This retention is partially regulated by auxin influx carriers 
AUXIN1 (AUX1) and LIKE-AUX1 (LAX1) (Bainbridge 
et al. 2008; Kierzkowski et al. 2013). In contrast to the polar-
ized subcellular localization of PIN1, the subcellular localiza-
tion of AUX1 is apolar (Reinhardt et al. 2003). When PIN1 
is expressed only in ­L1 of the SAM, regular phyllotaxis can 
still be displayed but only if AUX1 and LAX1 are localized 
in ­L1 (Kierzkowski et al. 2013). Lacking the auxin influx 
carriers, aux1 lax1 lax2 lax3 quadruple mutant has irregular 
divergence angles and forms leaf clusters (Bainbridge et al. 
2008). In aux1 lax1 lax 2 lax3, while auxin is exported via 
PIN1, less auxin is taken up by the neighboring cell, and more 
auxin diffuses into the apoplast, and thus, auxin maxima are 
less regulated in ­L1 of the SAM (Bainbridge et al. 2008). In 
addition, the presence of auxin influx inhibitors often disturb 
primordia positioning (Stieger et al. 2002).
Auxin biosynthesis and signaling: additional 
requirements to maintain phyllotaxis
To initiate organs in a regular phyllotactic pattern, the SAM 
must be supplied with an adequate amount of auxin and 
maintain its auxin homeostasis in the first place. Changing 
auxin production in the SAM is sufficient to cause phyllo-
tactic pattern transitions in silico (Smith et al. 2006). Auxin 
biosynthesis is partially regulated by the AP2 domain tran-
scription factors PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 
(Pinon et al. 2013; Prasad et al. 2011). Strikingly, Arabi-
dopsis plt3 plt5 plt7 triple mutant has divergence angles of 
180° or 90° in their inflorescence, instead of 137.5° as in 
the wild type, (Pinon et al. 2013; Prasad et al. 2011), and 
the amount of auxin is significantly lower in its inflores-
cence meristem than in the wild type (Pinon et al. 2013). 
PLT can rapidly and possibly directly activate the expression 
of YUCCA1 (YUC1) and YUC4, which encode monooxyge-
nases involved in a rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis 
(Pinon et al. 2013). YUC1 and YUC4 are expressed in ­L1 of 
the lateral side of the inflorescence meristem and developing 
flowers (Galvan-Ampudia et al. 2020). In yuc1 yuc4 double 
mutant, floral phyllotaxis is severely perturbed (Galvan-
Ampudia et al. 2020), and divergence angle often becomes 
180° (Pinon et al. 2013). Furthermore, expressing YUC4 in 
the inflorescence meristem of plt3 plt5 plt7 can fully rescue 
the phenotype (Pinon et al. 2013). In addition, the role of 
auxin biosynthesis in phyllotaxis is found to be also closely 
interrelated with polar auxin transport and auxin sensitivity 
(Yoshikawa et al. 2014), further complicating the interpreta-
tion. FISH BONE (FIB) encodes a tryptophan aminotrans-
ferase, another important enzyme in auxin biosynthesis in 
rice (Yoshikawa et al. 2014). fib mutant has less auxin in the 
shoot than in the wild type, and altered polar auxin transport 
activity and auxin sensitivity, which together result in aber-
rant phyllotaxis (Yoshikawa et al. 2014).
Recent experimental evidences suggest that auxin signal-
ing in the SAM is not a direct readout of auxin concentra-
tion (Galvan-Ampudia et al. 2020). The activation of auxin 
signaling to promote organogenesis depends not only on 
an appropriate concentration of auxin, but also on a cer-
tain duration of exposure to auxin (Galvan-Ampudia et al. 
2020). Such temporal integration of auxin likely depends on 
ARF3/ETTIN (ARF3/ETT) (Galvan-Ampudia et al. 2020); a 
mutation in this gene results in aberrant phyllotaxis (Galvan-
Ampudia et al. 2020; Simonini et al. 2017).

A matter of when: multiple factors 
determine plastochron and plastochron 
ratio
The role of polar auxin transport and auxin 
biosynthesis
A disruption in polar auxin transport in the SAM can not 
only result in altered positioning of auxin maxima, as in 
er erl1 erl2 (Chen et al. 2013), it can also lead to altered 
timing of auxin maxima formation (Stieger et al. 2002). 
Such altered timing of auxin maxima formation may lead 
to a change in plastochron and plastochron ratio and ulti-
mately a continuous transition of phyllotactic patterns. 
As previously mentioned, ER family genes affect phyl-
lotaxis pleiotropically. Another phenotype of er erl1 erl2 
that results from disrupted PIN1 localization and defective 
auxin transport is a longer vegetative plastochron (Chen 
et al. 2013). In addition, pin1, despite abolishing flower 
formation, has a longer and more variable vegetative plas-
tochron (Guenot et al. 2012).
Similarly, a disruption in auxin biosynthesis can alter 
the positioning of auxin maxima, as in plt3 plt5 plt7 (Pinon 
et al. 2013; Prasad et al. 2011), as well as the timing of 
auxin maxima formation. Arabidopsis slow motion (slomo) 
mutant, which is characterized by a reduced amount of 
auxin in the inflorescence meristem, possibly due to 
reduced auxin biosynthesis, has a longer plastochron and 
a greater plastochron ratio in both the vegetative shoot and 
the inflorescence (Lohmann et al. 2010). SLOMO encodes 
an F-box protein, which acts as the specificity determi-
nation component in a multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase 
(Lohmann et al. 2010). Using Richards’ (1951) phyllo-
taxis index, it could be inferred that, although subtle, the 
increase in plastochron ratio from 1.098 (wild type) to 
1.166 (slomo) (Lohmann et al. 2010) is indeed a continu-
ous transition from the (5, 8) pattern (wild type) to the (3, 
5) pattern (slomo).
The role of genes
We might intuitively think that a shortage of auxin in the 
SAM would lead to a longer time for auxin maxima for-
mation and thus lead to a longer plastochron, as in slomo, 
but this scenario is too simplified. A counterexample is 
Arabidopsis overexpressing ALTERED DEVELOPMENT 
PROGRAM1 (ADP1), a multidrug and toxic compound 
extrusion (MATE) family transporter (Li et al. 2014). 
adp1-D dominant mutant has a reduced auxin level in the 
SAM yet a shorter vegetative plastochron compared with 
the wild type. In fact, many genes regulate plastochron in 
parallel, which suggests a much more complex mecha-
nism. Despite having a reduced amount of auxin in the 
inflorescence meristem comparable to slomo, Arabidopsis 
kluh (klu) mutant has a shorter, but not longer, vegeta-
tive and inflorescence plastochron (Anastasiou et al. 2007; 
Lohmann et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2008). Similarly, rice 
plastochron1 (pla1) mutant also has a shorter vegetative 
plastochron, presumably due to a larger vegetative SAM 
which has a faster rate of cell division (Itoh et al. 1998; 
Miyoshi et al. 2004). KLU and PLA1 are orthologs that 
encode a plant-specific cytochrome P450, which catalyzes 
the production of an unknown mobile signal (Anastasiou 
et al. 2007; Miyoshi et al. 2004). PLA1 is expressed in 
leaf primordia, but not in the vegetative SAM, indicating 
that this signal from leaf primordia regulates plastochron 
in the vegetative SAM non-cell-autonomously (Miyoshi 
et al. 2004). The transport of this signal requires MATE 
family transporters (Burko et al. 2011; Suzuki et al. 2015).
Rice pla2 mutant has an even shorter vegetative plas-
tochron than pla1; and a slightly larger vegetative SAM, 
which has a faster rate of cell division than the wild type 
(Kawakatsu et al. 2006). PLA2 encodes an RNA-binding 
protein (Kawakatsu et al. 2006; Xiong et al. 2006). Like 
PLA1, it is expressed in leaf primordia, but not in the veg-
etative SAM, indicating that it also regulates plastochron 
non-cell-autonomously (Kawakatsu et al. 2006). PLA2′s 
ortholog in maize (Zea mays L.), TERMINAL EAR1 (TE1), 
plays the same role in vegetative plastochron regulation 
(Veit et al. 1998). However, one major difference between 
these two orthologs is that TE1 also plays a role in organ 
positioning, because te1 mutant has disturbed vegetative 
divergence angles (Veit et al. 1998). Although PLA1/KLU 
and PLA2/TE1 encode distinct classes of proteins, they are 
both downstream of the GA signaling pathway (Mimura and 
Itoh 2014; Mimura et al. 2012). This is consistent with their 
spatial expression pattern, since GA is synthesized in leaf 
primordia, where it plays an important role in leaf matura-
tion. In fact, other phenotypes of pla1, pla2, and klu include 
smaller leaves and precocious leaf maturation (Anastasiou 
et al. 2007; Kawakatsu et al. 2006; Miyoshi et al. 2004). 
Therefore, the shorter plastochron phenotype of pla1 and 
pla2 seems to result from a combination of a larger SAM, 
which has a faster rate of cell division, and precocious 
leaf maturation. In line with this, following ­GA3 treatment 
in X. pennsylvanicum, the rate of cell division in the SAM 
increases, and plastochron and plastochron ratio decrease, 
resulting in a continuous transition from the (2, 3) pattern 
to the (3, 5) pattern (Maksymowych and Erickson 1977; 
Maksymowych et al. 1976).
Rice pla3 mutant has similar phenotypes to those of pla1 
and pla2: a shorter vegetative plastochron, a larger vegeta-
tive SAM which has a faster rate of cell division, smaller 
leaves, and precocious leaf maturation (Kawakatsu et al. 

385

2009). In contrast to PLA1 and PLA2, PLA3 is expressed 
in both the vegetative SAM and leaf primordia (Kawakatsu 
et al. 2009). Nonetheless, PLA3 might also regulate plas-
tochron non-cell-autonomously since it encodes a gluta-
mate carboxypeptidase, which might be involved in various 
metabolic pathways via small signaling molecules such as 
peptides (Kawakatsu et al. 2009). PLA3′s ortholog in maize 
and Arabidopsis, VIVIPAROUS8 (VP8) and ALTERED 
MERISTEM PROGRAM1 (AMP1), respectively, play the 
same role in regulating vegetative plastochron (Chaudhury 
et al. 1993; Evans and Poethig 1997). However, strikingly, 
in amp1 mutant, not only is the plastochron shorter, but the 
vegetative phyllotactic pattern also changes from the spiral 
pattern to the tricussate pattern (Chaudhury et al. 1993). The 
shorter plastochron phenotype in pla3 and amp1 (and the 
drastic change in the phyllotactic pattern in amp1) might be 
due to an elevated level of cytokinin (Chaudhury et al. 1993; 
Kawakatsu et al. 2009), which could cause a larger SAM 
(discussed in Section “SAM geometry and organization as 
important regulators of phyllotaxis”). However, a few other 
observations complicate this explanation. First, the cytokinin 
level is not altered in vp8 mutant, nor does it have a larger 
SAM (Suzuki et al. 2008). Second, there is a difference 
between KLU expression in amp1 in Arabidopsis and PLA1 
expression in pla3 in rice. In Arabidopsis, KLU expression 
is upregulated in amp1, which is not related to the elevated 
amount of cytokinin (Helliwell et al. 2001), whereas in rice, 
PLA1 expression is not changed in pla3 (Kawakatsu et al. 
2009). Regardless, PLA3/VP8/AMP1 regulate plastochron 
in parallel with PLA1/KLU and PLA2/TE1.
Another gene regulates vegetative plastochron in rice is 
ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) (Ikeda 
et al. 2005, 2007). apo1 mutant has a shorter vegetative (and 
embryonic) plastochron. However, unlike pla mutants, the 
size of its SAM is comparable to the wild type until the late 
vegetative stage, and SAM enlargement during this stage is 
less vigorous than the wild type (Ikeda et al. 2005, 2007). 
Curiously, instead of the spiral pattern, apo1 inflorescence 
has the distichous pattern or the spirodistichous pattern with 
a divergence angle of around 160°, possibly due to a smaller 
but more convex inflorescence meristem (Ikeda et al. 2005). 
APO1 encodes an F-box protein and is expressed in the SAM 
and organ primordia throughout vegetative and reproduc-
tive growth and plays pleotropic roles (Ikeda et al. 2007). 
While the dominant gain-of-function apo1-D mutant has an 
increased amount of APO1 mRNA and does not vary in its 
spatial expression pattern, it does have a longer vegetative 
plastochron. The size of its SAM is also comparable to the 
wild type during the vegetative stage. In contrast, the SAM 
of apo1-D during the reproductive stage enlarges more rap-
idly than in the wild type (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2009). 
APO1 is thought to promote cell division in the SAM in 
general (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2009). However, unlike 
pla mutants, which are characterized by a faster rate of cell 
division in the SAM, apo1 is characterized by a slower rate 
of cell division (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2009), rendering it 
difficult to explain how APO1 regulates the vegetative plas-
tochron. APO1 expression depends on APO2, the ortholog of 
Arabidopsis LEAFY (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2012; Kyozuka 
et al. 1998). Like apo1, apo2 mutant also has a shorter vege-
tative plastochron and the distichous pattern due to a smaller 
inflorescence meristem (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2012).
The role of miRNA
Arabidopsis serrate (se) mutant has a longer vegetative 
plastochron (Clarke et al. 1999; Prigge and Wagner 2001). 
In addition, se has a divergence angle of 90° in the veg-
etative shoot (Clarke et al. 1999) and clustered flowers in 
the inflorescence (Prigge and Wagner 2001). SE encodes a 
zinc finger protein and is expressed in the SAM and organ 
primordia throughout vegetative and reproductive growth 
(Prigge and Wagner 2001). One function of SE is primary 
microRNA (miRNA) processing (Laubinger et al. 2008; 
Lobbes et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2006), indicating miRNA 
is involved in plastochron regulation. In line with this, sev-
eral components involved in the biogenesis of miRNA or 
miRNA-directed target cleavage, such as RECEPTOR FOR 
ACTIVATED C KINASE1 (RACK1) (Guo and Chen 2008) 
and ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) (Wang et al. 2008), also play 
a role in plastochron regulation. rack1 mutant (Guo and 
Chen 2008) and ago1 mutant (Wang et al. 2008) both have 
a longer vegetative plastochron.
One miRNA downregulated in se is miR156 (Lobbes 
et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2006), which targets SQUAMOSA 
PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription 
factors (Rhoades et al. 2002). Overexpression of MIR156 
in Arabidopsis results in a shorter vegetative plastochron, 
a vegetative SAM of comparable size but a faster rate of 
cell division, and smaller leaves, compared with the wild 
type. In contrast, compromising the miR156 target site 
of SPL genes results in a longer vegetative plastochron 
(Schwab et al. 2005; Schwarz et al. 2008; Wu and Poethig 
2006; Wang et al. 2008), consistent with the longer veg-
etative plastochron phenotype of se. miR156 functions to 
decrease the overall expression levels of SPL genes instead 
of spatially confining their expression (Wang et al. 2008). 
SPL genes such as SPL9 are expressed in leaf primordia 
and developing leaves, but not in the vegetative SAM itself 
(Wang et al. 2008). Furthermore, when miR156 in specific 
domains or specific developmental stages is misexpressed, 
plastochron is affected only when miR156 is misexpressed in 
leaf primordia (Wang et al. 2008). These observations indi-
cate that, despite having the opposite effect of PLA genes, 
the miR156/SPL pathway also regulates plastochron non-
cell-autonomously. Similarly, in rice and maize, miR156 and

miR156-targeted SPL genes OsSPL14 (Luo et al. 2012), and 
TASSELSHEATH4 (TSH4), UNBRANCHED2 (UB2), and 
UB3 (Chuck et al. 2007, 2010, 2014), respectively, regulate 
plastochron non-cell-autonomously. A possible interaction 
between the miR156/SPL pathway and the APO1/APO2 
pathway has also been suggested (Luo et al. 2012).
A secondary “inhibitory field” for correct order 
of organ initiation
In addition to the aforementioned factors that regulate the 
absolute length of plastochron, a specific mechanism main-
tains the correct order of organ initiation by preventing the 
premature initiation or co-initiation of incipient primor-
dia. Arabidopsis ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHO-
TRANSFER PROTEIN6 (AHP6) encodes a pseudophospho-
transfer protein that inhibits cytokinin signaling (Mähönen 
et al. 2006). Instead of the “Golden Angle”, 137.5° (α), 
ahp6 mutant is characterized by frequent divergence angle 
series of 275° (2α), 222.5° (360° − α), and 275° (2α), the 
so called “M-motif”, along its inflorescence stem (Besnard 
et al. 2014; Guedon et al. 2013; Fig. 7a). Careful analysis 
indicates that the “M-motif” is not caused by aberrant flower 
positioning but rather by an inverted order of flowers at the 
correct positions (Besnard et al. 2014; Guedon et al. 2013; 
Fig. 7b), a phenomenon known as “permutation” (Couder, 
1998; Douady and Couder 1996a, c). Permutations on the 
inflorescence stem mostly result from flower co-initiation, 
suggesting that the role of AHP6 in stabilizing plastochron is 
to prevent premature flower initiation (Besnard et al. 2014). 
AHP6 is activated by MP-mediated auxin signaling (Bes-
nard et al. 2014), indicating an even more complex scenario 
where auxin and cytokinin crosstalk to ensure the correct 
order of organ initiation. Curiously, AHP6 moves from flo-
ral primordia where it is made, to incipient floral primor-
dia where it inhibits cytokinin signaling and prevents its 
premature initiation (Besnard et al. 2014). In agreement with 
the role of AHP6, triple and quintuple mutants of B-GATA​ 
transcription factors, which redundantly act downstream 
of cytokinin signaling, also have a higher frequency of the 
“M-motif” in their inflorescence (Ranftl et al. 2016). There-
fore, in addition to the primary “inhibitory field” imposed 
by auxin depletion in the vicinity of young primordia for 
correct positioning of organ initiation, AHP6-mediated cyto-
kinin signaling inhibition imposes a secondary “inhibitory 
field” for correct order of organ initiation.
Unexpectedly, permutations can also be found in vari-
ous ecotypes of wild type Arabidopsis and in mutants at 
a lower frequency (Besnard et al. 2014; Fal et al. 2017; 
Guedon et al. 2013; Landrein et al. 2015) and in sunflower 
(Couder 1998), indicating that it is a relatively common phe-
nomenon. Theoretical and experimental approaches support 
the notion that the size of the SAM is positively correlated 
with the frequency of permutations, assuming the inhibi-
tion domain of primordia is constant (Landrein et al. 2015; 
Mirabet et al. 2012). In relation to this, some studies also 
support the notion that the size of the SAM is negatively 
correlated with plastochron and plastochron ratio, assuming 
the inhibition domain of primordia is constant (Douady and 
Couder 1996c; Landrein et al. 2015). However, the relation-
ship between the size of the SAM and plastochron is not 
so straightforward. While klu, apo1, apo1-D, and miR156-
overexpressor all have an unaltered size of the SAM and 
either a longer or a shorter plastochron (Ikeda et al. 2005, 
2007; Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2008), 
Arabidopsis lonely guy7 (log7) mutant, which is defective in 
cytokinin biosynthesis, has a smaller SAM and an unaltered 
plastochron (Tokunaga et al. 2012). Thus, both the rate of 
cell division (Itoh et al. 1998; Kawakatsu et al. 2006, 2009; 
Miyoshi et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2008) and the size of the 
SAM (Kwon et al. 2005) seem to be important regulators 
of plastochron.

SAM geometry and organization 
as important regulators of phyllotaxis
Since the auxin positive feedback loop operates within the 
SAM to determine divergence angle, and plastochron, plas-
tochron ratio, and the frequency of permutations are all cor-
related with parameter Γ, undoubtedly, the SAM is impor-
tant in phyllotaxis (Barabé and Lacroix 2020). Relatively 
little is known about how the size of primordia upon initia-
tion is determined, except that either higher concentrations 
of auxin maxima or compromising auxin influx can result in 
wider primordia upon initiation, possibly due to more cells 
in the SAM being exposed to auxin (Reinhardt et al. 2000, 
2003; Stieger et al. 2002). In contrast, we have a much bet-
ter understanding of how the absolute size, as well as the 
shape and the structure of the SAM are regulated. Various 
reasons could cause SAM enlargement, fasciation, and, in 
extreme cases, bifurcation. As a result, phyllotaxis can also 
be disturbed secondarily.
Genetic regulators of the size of the SAM and their 
involvement in phyllotaxis
The SAM is well organized and can be divided into distinct 
functional zones (Fig. 8). In brief, the central zone (CZ) is 
located at the apex and is characterized by relatively slow 
cell divisions to renew itself and provide cells laterally to 
the surrounding peripheral zone (PZ), and basipetally to 
the organizing center (OC) and the rib zone (RZ) (Fig. 8). 
The PZ is characterized by faster cell divisions and pro-
vides cells to incipient primordia and hence gives rise to 
phyllotaxis (Steeves and Sussex 1989). A negative feedback 
loop maintains the structure of the SAM. In Arabidopsis, 
WUSCHEL (WUS), which encodes a transcriptional factor 
that specifies the undifferentiated state of cells, is expressed 
in the OC (Laux et al. 1996; Mayer et al. 1998; Fig. 8). WUS 
moves through plasmodesmata upward to the CZ, where it 
directly activates CLAVATA3 (CLV3) transcription (Yadav 
et al. 2011). CLV3 encodes a ligand peptide and is perceived 
by multiple plasma membrane localized receptors such as 
CLV1, an LRR-RLK (Clark et al. 1997; Fletcher et al. 1999), 
and the CLV2/CORYNE (CRN) complex (Müller et al. 
2008) in the OC. CLV3 in turn restricts WUS expression 
in the OC (Brand et al. 2000; Müller et al. 2008; Schoof 
et al. 2000; Fig. 8), closing the WUS–CLV3 negative feed-
back loop. There is a positive correlation between the size 
of WUS and CLV3 expression domains and the overall size 
of the SAM (Gruel et al. 2016). In addition, there is a cor-
relation between the lateral dimension of the WUS and CLV3 
expression domains and the shape of the SAM. The wider 
their expression domains, the flatter the SAM (Gruel et al. 
2016), and hence, a greater half conic angle (Fig. 4c). Based 
on the dynamics of the WUS–CLV3 interaction, a computer 
model can simulate various scenarios of SAM including 
homeostasis, enlargement, fasciation, and bifurcation (Fujita 
et al. 2011).
Since the WUS–CLV3 negative feedback loop lies at the 
heart of regulating the size and the shape of the SAM, not 
surprisingly, all players in this loop can affect phyllotaxis in 
Arabidopsis. clv1 mutant has more convex, larger, fasciated, 
and in extreme cases, bifurcated vegetative SAM and inflo-
rescence meristem. The progressively misshapen vegetative 
SAM and inflorescence meristem are associated with phyl-
lotactic defects of various degrees at maturity. In addition, 
clv1 has a more convex and larger (but not fasciated) floral 
meristem, which produces more floral organs per whorl or 
one or two more carpel whorls (Clark et al. 1993; Leyser 
and Furner 1992). The phenotypes of clv2 and clv3 mutants 
are almost identical to that of clv1 (Clark et al. 1995; Kayes 
and Clark 1998) and have no clearly identifiable vegetative 
or inflorescence phyllotaxis at maturity (Laufs et al. 1998a; 
Szczęsny et al. 2009).
In pea (Pisum sativum L.), besides the fasciation phe-
notype, psclv2 mutant has the decussate pattern compared 
to the spiral pattern in the wild type (Krusell et al. 2011). 
In rice, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, 
the ortholog of CLV1 and CLV3, respectively, affect only 
the size and phyllotaxis of the floral meristem in inner 
floral whorls (lodicules, stamens, and pistils) (Nagasawa 
et  al. 1996; Suzaki et  al. 2004, 2006). Nonetheless, 
depending on the genetic background, FON2 might also

regulate the size and phyllotaxis of the inflorescence 
meristem (Chu et al. 2006). In maize, THICK TASSEL 
DWARF1 (TD1) and FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2), the 
ortholog of CLV1 and CLV2, respectively, affect primar-
ily the size and the shape of the inflorescence meristem, 
especially the ear, and regulates phyllotaxis of spikelet 
pair meristems and kernel rows (Bommert et al. 2005, 
2013; Taguchi-Shiobara et al. 2001). Collectively, these 
studies suggest functional conservation and diversifica-
tion of the WUS–CLV negative feedback loop in regu-
lating the size and the shape of the SAM and affecting 
phyllotaxis secondarily in different plant lineages.
Although the most prominent phenotype of wus mutant 
is the premature termination of the SAM and wus itself 
does not exhibit a clear phyllotaxis (Laux et al. 1996), 
WUS regulators that function independently of CLV3 also 
contribute to the regulation of the SAM and phyllotaxis. 
Arabidopsis jabba-1D dominant mutant, which is char-
acterized by a larger and fasciated vegetative SAM and 
inflorescence meristem, has broader but not uniform 
WUS expression (Williams et al. 2005). Sometimes there 
are two adjacent WUS expression foci, consistent with 
the extreme SAM bifurcation phenotype (Williams et al. 
2005). In jabba-1D, overexpression of MIR166G causes 
a decrease in the expression of several class III homeodo-
main leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) genes such as PHABU-
LOSA (PHB), PHEVOLUTA​ (PHV), and CORONA (CNA), 
which in turn leads to the broader WUS expression (Wil-
liams et al. 2005). Similarly, Arabidopsis phb phv cna 
triple mutant has the same phenotype as jabba1-D (Prigge 
et al. 2005). In addition, as discussed in Sections “A mat-
ter of where: an auxin positive feedback loop determines 
divergence angle” and “A matter of when: multiple factors 
determine plastochron and plastochron ratio”, the ER fam-
ily genes affect phyllotaxis pleiotropically by regulating 
both divergence angle and plastochron via PIN1-mediated 
auxin transport (Chen et al. 2013). Yet another role of 
the ER family genes in affecting phyllotaxis is regulat-
ing the size of the SAM (Uchida et al. 2013). The SAM 
enlargement and fasciation phenotype of the hemizygous 
jabba-1D/+ is further enhanced by combining er (Man-
del et al. 2014). Careful SAM morphometric analysis of 
single, double, and triple mutant combinations of clv3, 
jabba-1D/+ , and er reveals a gradient of vegetative SAM 
enlargement, indicating that CLV3, miR166/HD-ZIP III, 
and ER work in parallel to regulate WUS expression 
(Mandel et al. 2016). The number of leaves formed per 
node is correlated with this size gradient of the SAM dur-
ing the early vegetative phase. The wild type, which has 
the smallest SAM, has one leaf per node (spiral pattern). 
In contrast, clv3 jabba-1D/+ er triple mutant, which has 
the largest SAM, has four leaves per node (tetracussate 
pattern) (Mandel et al. 2016).
Cytokinin as a regulator of the size of the SAM 
and its involvement in phyllotaxis
The phytohormone cytokinin and its signaling also play an 
important role in regulating WUS expression (Bartrina et al. 
2011; Giulini et al. 2004; Gordon et al. 2009; Gruel et al. 
2016; Kurakawa et al. 2007; Leibfried et al. 2005; Lindsay 
et al. 2006), and thus the size of the SAM (Tokunaga et al. 
2012) and phyllotaxis. Arabidopsis treated with N6-ben-
zylaminopurine (BAP) has increased WUS expression, 
decreased CLV1 expression, and phenotypes similar to clv 
mutants (Lindsay et al. 2006). Similarly, E. lathyris treated 
with benzyladenine (BA) has a much larger vegetative SAM 
and the number of leaves formed per node is positively cor-
related with the size of the SAM (Mingo-Castel et al. 1984). 
In contrast, overexpression of cytokinin oxidase/dehydroge-
nase (CKX), which causes increased cytokinin breakdown, 
results in a smaller vegetative SAM in Arabidopsis (Werner 
et al. 2003). Furthermore, WUS represses the transcription 
of several type A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 
(ARR​) genes (Leibfried et al. 2005), negative regulators of 
cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis (To et al. 2004). One type 
A ARR​, ARR7, negatively feeds back on WUS expression 
(Leibfried et al. 2005), further complicating the inter-regu-
latory network between WUS and cytokinin signaling. arr3 
arr4 arr5 arr6 arr7 arr8 arr9 septuple mutant has a larger 
inflorescence meristem and phyllotactic defects (Leibfried 
et al. 2005), similar to RNAi-induced proteasome-mediated 
reduced expression of type A ARR​s (Ryu et al. 2009), indi-
cating a negative role of type A ARR​ in regulating the size 
of the SAM and phyllotaxis.
One well-characterized type A cytokinin response regula-
tor affecting the size of the SAM and phyllotaxis is maize 
ABERRANT PHYLLOTAXY1 (ABPH1) (Giulini et al. 2004; 
Lee et al. 2009). abph1 mutant has an enlarged vegetative 
SAM, and the distichous pattern of the wild type is stably 
changed to the decussate pattern (Giulini et al. 2004; Jackson 
and Hake 1999). Surprisingly, ABPH1 also interacts with 
polar auxin transport both positively and negatively (Lee 
et al. 2009). On the one hand, ABPH1 expression is reduced 
after NPA treatment, indicating that ABPH1 expression is 
dependent on accumulated auxin. On the other hand, PIN1 
expression and the auxin level are reduced in abph1, indicat-
ing that ABPH1 is required for polar auxin transport (Lee 
et al. 2009). Therefore, ABPH1 plays a dual role in regu-
lating phyllotaxis in maize: maintaining the proper size of 
the SAM and regulating polar auxin transport in the SAM 
for correct positioning of primordia initiation (Lee et al. 
2009). Rice decussate (dec) mutant has the same phenotype 
as abph1 (Itoh et al. 2012). Although the exact function of 
DEC is unknown, in dec, the sensitivity to exogenous cyto-
kinin application is reduced, and several type A response

regulators are also downregulated, including OsRR5, the 
closest homolog of ABPH1 in rice (Itoh et al. 2012).
Post‑translational modifications in the regulation 
of the size of the SAM and phyllotaxis
In Arabidopsis, wiggum (wig) mutant has a defect in protein 
farnesylation and a similar but less severe SAM enlarge-
ment and fasciation and phyllotaxis phenotype compared 
to clv mutants (Running et al. 1998; Yalovsky et al. 2000; 
Ziegelhoffer et al. 2000). In tomato, a defect in SlCLV3 
arabinosylation results in SAM enlargement and fascia-
tion and additional carpels in flowers (Xu et al. 2015). In 
maize abph2 dominant mutant, broader expression of MALE 
STERILE CONVERTED ANTHER1 (MSCA1) results in 
an enlarged vegetative SAM and the distichous pattern of 
the wild type changes to the decussate pattern (Yang et al. 
2015). In contrast, msca1 mutant has a smaller vegetative 
SAM, suggesting that MSCA1 is a positive regulator of the 
size of the SAM (Yang et al. 2015). MSCA1 encodes a glu-
taredoxin, which catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds 
(Yang et al. 2015). One possible target of MSCA1 is FEA4 
(Yang et al. 2015), a TGACG-binding (TGA) transcription 
factor, which regulates auxin response and organ differentia-
tion in the PZ of the SAM (Pautler et al. 2015). fea4 mutant 
has an enlarged and massively fasciated inflorescence meris-
tem, especially the ear meristem, and associated phyllotactic 
defects in spikelet pair meristems and kernel rows (Pautler 
et al. 2015). Interestingly, FEA4′s ortholog in Arabidopsis, 
PERIANTHIA (PAN), does play a role in determining floral 
organ numbers by controlling the distance between floral 
organs (Chuang et al. 1999), even though it is not implicated 
in regulating the size of the SAM (Running and Meyerowitz 
1996), suggesting functional diversification.
The importance of the organization of the SAM 
in phyllotaxis
While WUS is at the heart of the inter-regulatory network 
that regulates the size and the shape of the SAM, the organ-
ization of the SAM must also be properly maintained. It 
is crucial in the SAM for achieving cell pool homeostasis 
between cell division in the CZ, which adds new cells to 
the SAM, and cell differentiation in the PZ, which occurs 
when cells exit the SAM as they are recruited to incipient 
primordia. In Arabidopsis, despite being normal in terms of 
size and shape, the SAM of forever young (fey) heterozy-
gote has necrotic, vacuolated, and otherwise disorganized 
cells, indicative of premature cell differentiation (Callos 
et al. 1994; Medford et al. 1992). An unusual number of 
cells are recruited from the SAM to incipient primordia in 
fey (Medford et al. 1992). As a result, both divergence angle 
and plastochron ratio vary widely (Callos et al. 1994). FEY 
encodes an oxidoreductase, which most likely functions to 
modify a signal for maintaining SAM organization (Callos 
et al. 1994). In sunflower and soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
Merr.], STEM FASCIATED (STF) (Fambrini et al. 2006) and 
FASCIATION (F) (Tang and Knap 1998), respectively, func-
tion in cell division and cell differentiation patterning in the 
SAM, possibly by maintaining the proper endogenous auxin 
level. stf mutant has a fasciated SAM that progressively 
enlarges over time and phyllotactic defects in the vegetative 
stage and no clearly identifiable phyllotaxis in the capitulum 
(Fambrini et al. 2006), whereas f mutant first has the decus-
sate pattern, followed by a semi-whorled pattern instead of 
the typical distichous pattern that is maintained in the wild 
type (Tang and Knap 1998).
A more severe disruption of the SAM cell pool homeo-
stasis could result in a complete random phyllotactic pattern 
(Itoh et al. 2000; Satoh et al. 2003). Rice shoot organization1 
(sho1), sho2/shootless4 (shl4), and sho3 recessive mutants 
and shl1 and shl2 weak alleles are characterized by frequent 
yet spatially disorganized cell divisions and fewer indeter-
minate cells in the SAM (Itoh et al. 2000; Satoh et al. 1999, 
2003). As a result, both divergence angle and plastochron 
are completely random during the early vegetative stage, 
even among different individuals within the same genotype 
(Itoh et al. 2000; Satoh et al. 2003; Tamura et al. 1992). 
SHO1, SHO2/SHL4, and SHL2 encode DICER-like protein 
4 (DCL4), AGO7, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 
(RDR6), respectively (Nagasaki et al. 2007), all of which are 
important components of the trans-acting small interference 
RNA (ta-siRNA) biogenesis pathway (Hunter et al. 2003; 
Peragine et al. 2004; Xie et al. 2005; Yoshikawa et al. 2005). 
The SHO/SHL ta-siRNA pathway controls the accumula-
tion of miR166, which in turn cleaves HD-ZIP III genes 
(Nagasaki et al. 2007), whose function includes regulating 
SAM activity (McConnell et al. 2001). In sho1 and sho2, 
the level of accumulation of miR166 is significantly higher 
and the expression of HD-ZIP III genes is significantly lower 
than in the wild type, ultimately resulting in disorganized 
cell divisions in the SAM and random phyllotaxis (Nagasaki 
et al. 2007).
The importance of genome stability and integrity 
of the SAM cell pool in phyllotaxis
Since the SAM cell pool is the ultimate source of all cells of 
the entire aboveground plant body, it is critical that genome 
stability and integrity be maintained, especially during fre-
quent cell divisions. A failure in chromatin organization, 
DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression 
could all lead to SAM structural defects, which is usually 
accompanied by WUS misexpression. Mutations in all the 
genes described next cause phyllotactic defects of various

degrees as a result of SAM enlargement, fasciation, and 
bifurcation.
Arabidopsis FASCIATA1 (FAS1) and FAS2 encode two 
subunits of chromatin assembly factor-1, which ensures the 
stable propagation of the epigenetic state of chromosomes 
through facilitating chromatin assembly during DNA rep-
lication (Kaya et al. 2001). In fas1 and fas2 mutants, WUS 
expression expands laterally and apically (Kaya et al. 2001). 
Arabidopsis FAS5/MGOUN1 (MGO1) encodes a DNA 
topoisomerase TOP1α (Takahashi et al. 2002), which, in 
addition to its primary function as relaxing supercoiled DNA 
during DNA replication and transcription, also functions 
synergistically with various chromatin regulators to stabi-
lize the epigenetic state of several developmentally regu-
lated genes (Graf et al. 2010). In fas5/mgo1 mutant, WUS 
and CLV3 expression is fragmented (Graf et al. 2010), and 
the SAM often bifurcates (Laufs et al. 1998b). Arabidop-
sis MGOUN3/BRUSHY1/TONSOKU (MGO3/BRU1/TSK) 
encodes a nuclear leucin-glycine-asparagine (LGN) domain 
protein, which is involved in genome maintenance, DNA 
repair, cell cycle progression, and asymmetric cell divi-
sions (Guyomarc’h et al. 2004; Suzuki et al. 2004, 2005; 
Takeda et  al. 2004). In mgo3/bru1/tsk  mutant, WUS 
expression is also fragmented, and the cell division plane 
in the SAM is impaired (Suzuki et al. 2004). Arabidopsis 
AtBRCA2 encodes a BRC motif protein, which functions 
in double strand DNA break repair in vegetative cells (Abe 
et al. 2009). In atbrca2a homozygote, WUS expression is 
expanded laterally, although not uniformly (Abe et al. 2009). 
Arabidopsis CONSERVED TELOMERE MAINTENANCE 
COMPONENT1 (CTC1), AtSTN1, and TELOMERIC PATH-
WAYS IN ASSOCIATION WITH STN1/MERISTEM DISOR-
GANIZATION (TEN1/MDO1) encode three subunits of the 
CST trimeric complex, which is implicated in telomere func-
tions to protect chromosome ends from DNA damage and 
to facilitate DNA replication (Leehy et al. 2013; Song et al. 
2008; Surovtseva et al. 2009). One subunit, TEN1/MDO1, 
also facilitates DNA damage response (Hashimura and 
Ueguchi, 2011). Whether WUS expression is altered in ctc1, 
atstn1 and ten1/mdo1 is unknown.
Non‑cell‑autonomous signals 
from developing primordia and phyllotaxis
Signals from developing primordia that directly 
regulate WUS
In addition to those non-cell-autonomous factors regulating 
plastochron (discussed in section “A matter of when: mul-
tiple factors determine plastochron and plastochron ratio”), 
the presence of signals outside the SAM regulating phyllo-
taxis has also been suggested (Banasiak and Zagórska-Marek 
2006). One such signal from developing primordia is a ligand 
controlling the size and the shape of the SAM in maize 
and Arabidopsis (Je et al. 2016). Maize fea3 mutant has a 
larger and fasciated inflorescence meristem, especially the 
ear meristem, and associated phyllotactic defects in spike-
let pair meristems and kernel rows (Je et al. 2016), similar 
to fea2 and fea4 (discussed in section “SAM geometry and 
organization as important regulators of phyllotaxis”). FEA3 
is expressed below the OC in the SAM (and in developing 
primordia), and ZmWUS1 expression expands downward in 
fea3 (Je et al. 2016). FEA3 encodes an LRR receptor-like 
protein, and unexpectedly, its ligand, ZmFCP1, is expressed 
in developing primordia (Je et al. 2016). This indicates that 
signals from developing primordia can directly regulate 
WUS/ZmWUS1 expression as well as the size and the shape 
of the SAM, affecting phyllotaxis non-cell-autonomously.
Signals from developing primordia that indirectly 
regulate WUS via the SAM‑primordia boundary
In contrast, signals from developing primordia can also indi-
rectly regulate WUS expression. Arabidopsis filamentous 
flower (fil) mutant, yabby3 (yab3) mutant and fil yab3 dou-
ble mutant exhibit various phyllotactic defects in the inflo-
rescence and the floral meristem (Chen et al. 1999; Gold-
shmidt et al. 2008; Sawa et al. 1999), presumably resulting 
from expanded WUS and CLV3 expression (Goldshmidt 
et al. 2008; Shi et al. 2018). FIL and YAB3 are expressed 
in the abaxial domain of floral primordia, and neither their 
mRNA nor their protein is mobile (Goldshmidt et al. 2008). 
One explanation of the expanded WUS expression in fil 
yab3 is SAM enlargement due to reduced auxin level (Shi 
et al. 2018). Nonetheless, another explanation is that FIL 
and YAB3 indirectly regulate WUS expression via a second-
ary signal (Goldshmidt et al. 2008). This secondary signal 
is mediated in part by LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LAS), a 
GRAS family transcription factor expressed in the boundary 
between the SAM and organ primordia (Goldshmidt et al. 
2008). This implies that the boundary may participate in 
regulating phyllotaxis indirectly in Arabidopsis. In maize, a 
disruption of CORKSCREW1 (CKS1), which specifies the 
boundary between the vegetative SAM and leaf primordia, 
alters the distichous pattern to the spiral and occasionally 
decussate pattern (Alexander et al. 2005). Whether CKS1 
plays a direct or an indirect role in regulating maize vegeta-
tive phyllotaxis is unknown.
Other signals from developing primordia
FIL and YAB3 belong to the seed plant specific YABBY 
class transcription factors, which has a single ortholog 
of FIL and YAB3 in snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus L.), 
GRAMINIFOLIA (GRAM) (Golz et al. 2004). Similarly, 

391
Journal of Plant Research (2021) 134:373–401	
1 3
GRAM mRNA and protein are found in leaf primordia 
but not in the vegetative SAM (Golz et al. 2004; Nav-
arro et al. 2004), yet gram mutant exhibits defects in the 
vegetative phyllotaxis, although the details are different 
from fil and fil yab3 (Matkowski and Adler 1999). GRAM 
may regulate phyllotaxis in a different way than FIL and 
YAB3 do. GRAM interacts with STYLOSA (STY) and sty 
mutant exhibits reduced polar auxin transport in all tissues 
(Navarro et al. 2004). Defects in the vegetative phyllo-
taxis is more severe in gram sty double mutant than either 
of the single mutants (Navarro et al. 2004). Therefore, it 
is possible that GRAM affects phyllotaxis by disrupting 
polar auxin transport in the SAM. In addition, snapdragon 
PHANTASTICA (PHAN), which encodes a MYB family 
transcription factor and plays a key role in organ determi-
nation and adaxial domain specification (Waites and Hud-
son 1995; Waites et al. 1998), has a similar but milder role 
than GRAM in phyllotaxis (Matkowski and Adler 1999). 
How PHAN regulates phyllotaxis is unknown, although it 
might control the shape and the organization of the SAM 
(Waites et al. 1998). Since the primary functions of all 
these genes are lateral organ determination and ad/abaxial 
domain specification, it would be extremely intriguing to 
reveal how they acquired these functions to regulate phyl-
lotaxis non-cell-autonomously.
Cell wall mechanics and phyllotaxis
Cells in the SAM, once recruited and destined to form 
an incipient primordium, form a bulge by regulated cell 
division and oriented cell expansion. Cell expansion is 
controlled by the cell wall, which is composed of cellu-
lose microfibrils, linked by hemicellulose such as xyloglu-
can, and embedded in a pectin matrix. On the one hand, 
a global change in cell wall property of the SAM could 
result in phyllotactic defects. For example, compromis-
ing xyloglucan synthesis results in a global change in the 
geometry of the SAM and a different divergence angle dis-
tribution compared with the wild type (Zhao et al. 2019). 
In addition, Arabidopsis KATANIN1 (KTN1) encodes a 
microtubule severing protein, and ktn1 mutant is defective 
in cortical microtubule bundling and cellulose deposition 
orientation (Bichet et al. 2001; Burk and Ye 2002). Such a 
defect results in a reduced global response to mechanical 
stress (Uyttewaal et al. 2012) and a different distribution 
of divergence angle as well (Jackson et al. 2019). On the 
other hand, local changes in cell wall mechanical anisot-
ropy (Sassi et al. 2014) and cell wall stiffness, as induced 
by cell wall modifiers such as expansin and pectin methyl 
esterase (PME), play an important role in organ forma-
tion and phyllotaxis.
The role of expansin
Expansin is a class of proteins that can induce cell wall 
extension, and hence, cell expansion (McQueen-Mason 
et al. 1992). Expansin does not hydrolyze cell wall poly-
mers. Instead, it weakens hydrogen bonds between cel-
lulose microfibrils and the pectin matrix, thus allowing 
them to slide under stress (McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove 
1994, 1995). Expansin is expressed in incipient primordia 
(Reinhardt et al. 1998). In tomato, exogenous application of 
expansin can induce local bulges resembling primordia in 
the SAM, and some of these bulges can eventually become 
leaf-like structures (Fleming et al. 1997). In tobacco (Nico-
tiana tabacum L.), a transient local induction of expansin 
in the SAM can induce complete leaf morphogenesis (Pien 
et al. 2001). Both the application and the induction methods 
can induce and maintain a reversal of the direction of phyl-
lotaxis (Fleming et al. 1997; Pien et al. 2001).
The role of pectin and PME
Recently, pectin and PME have received more attention. 
When deposited in the cell wall, most pectin is in the methyl-
esterified form, which later becomes de-methyl-esterified 
by PME in incipient primordia. In Arabidopsis, overex-
pression of PMEI3, a PME inhibitor (PMEI), leads to the 
“pin” phenotype (Braybrook and Peaucelle 2013; Peaucelle 
et al. 2008, 2011a). By contrast, exogenous application of 
PME can induce fully functional flowers regardless of the 
application position in relation to existing floral primordia 
(Peaucelle et al. 2008). These observations suggest that 
PME-mediated pectin de-methyl-esterification in the cell 
wall is necessary and sufficient for floral primordia forma-
tion (Peaucelle et al. 2008). In addition, exogenous applica-
tion of PME or ectopic expression of PME5 can severely 
disrupt phyllotaxis without altering the geometry of the 
inflorescence meristem (Peaucelle et al. 2008, 2011a).
In the inflorescence meristem, PME activity is suppressed 
by BELLRINGER/PENNYWISE (BLR/PNY) (Peaucelle 
et al. 2011b), a BELL family homeodomain transcription 
factor, which is expressed in the SAM proper but not in 
incipient floral primordia (Byrne et al. 2003). In Arabidop-
sis blr/pny mutant, PME5 is ectopically expressed in the 
inflorescence meristem, which leads to a higher degree of 
pectin de-methyl-esterification across the inflorescence 
meristem (Peaucelle et al. 2011b). As a result, phyllotactic 
defects such as variable divergence angle (Byrne et al. 2003; 
Peaucelle et al. 2011b) and larger angle of intersection (γ) 
between parastichies (i.e., tighter flower packing) (Byrne 
et al. 2003) can be observed. Conversely, overexpression 
of BLR/PNY reduces PME5 expression and suppresses leaf 
formation (Etchells et al. 2012). In rice, a related gene, VER-
TICILLATE RACHIS (RI), and its paralog RI-LIKE1 (RIL1), 

392

play a similar role as BLR/PNY in the primary branch phyl-
lotaxis on the inflorescence (Ikeda et al. 2019).
Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), it was revealed 
that pectin de-methyl-esterification in incipient primordia 
contributes to cell wall softening in underlying cells but 
not in ­L1 cells (Braybrook and Peaucelle 2013; Peaucelle 
et al. 2011a). This process is downstream of the auxin net-
work (Braybrook and Peaucelle 2013). In the absence of 
polar auxin transport or auxin signaling, pectin de-methyl-
esterification can only trigger tissue outgrowth but cannot 
enable organ development (Braybrook and Peaucelle 2013). 
Furthermore, inhibition of pectin de-methyl-esterification 
disrupts the normal PIN1 polarity in cells of the SAM (Bray-
brook and Peaucelle 2013). These observations lead to a sce-
nario where the status of pectin methyl-esterification feeds 
back to PIN1 polarity in the SAM, possibly via mechanical 
signals, thereby forming a mechano-chemical loop (Bray-
brook and Peaucelle 2013).
Post SAM growth and phyllotaxis
So far it has been demonstrated that the SAM plays a central 
role in phyllotaxis. Nonetheless, post SAM growth also plays 
an important role in phyllotaxis. For example, the frequency 
of permutation is lower in the inflorescence stem than in 
the inflorescence meristem in both the wild type and ahp6 
(Besnard et al. 2014). Post SAM growth such as disrupted 
internode elongation and stem torsion contributes to post 
SAM phyllotactic defects.
Disrupted internode elongation
Clustered plant organs, variously called “growth whorls” 
(Schoute 1922), “binding whorls” (Schoute 1925), “pseudo-
whorls” (Kwiatkowska 1995), and “asynchronous whorls” 
(Rutishauser 1999), are common in certain plant species 
such as Peperomia verticillata (L.) A. Dietr. (Kwiatkowska 
1999) and result from disrupted internode elongation. In 
contrast to the suppression of PME activity by BLR/PNY 
in the SAM (discussed in Section “Cell wall mechanics and 
phyllotaxis”), BLR/PNY promotes PME activity in elongat-
ing internodes (Peaucelle et al. 2011b). blr/pny has post 
SAM phyllotactic defects such as clustered flowers, which 
result from shorter and irregular internode lengths on the 
inflorescence (Byrne et al. 2003; Peaucelle et al. 2011b). 
This internode length defect is due to a decreased length of 
epidermal cells on the inflorescence stem (Peaucelle et al. 
2011b), consistent with the role of PME in cell expansion 
(Peaucelle et al. 2011a). Similarly, in rice ri ril1/+ double 
mutant, internode elongation is disrupted on the inflores-
cence and the frequency of “pseudo-whorls” increases 
(Ikeda et al. 2019).
Post SAM phyllotactic defects due to disrupted inter-
node elongation could also be caused by defects in the 
miR164/CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC​) pathway 
(Burian et al. 2015; Peaucelle et al. 2007; Sieber et al. 2007). 
Arabidopsis plants that have lost their miR164 activity or are 
miR164-resistant are marked by elevated and ectopic expres-
sion of CUC1 and CUC2 in internodes of the inflorescence. 
As a result, both cell division and cell expansion are severely 
compromised in internodes, resulting in post SAM phyllotac-
tic defects (Peaucelle et al. 2007; Sieber et al. 2007). In Betula 
pendula Roth, overexpression of BpCUC2 results in similar 
internode and post SAM phyllotactic defects (Liu et al. 2019). 
Transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
coupled with polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR) revealed 
that BpCUC2 regulates cyclin-related genes and affects cell 
division (Liu et al. 2019). In contrast, in Arabidopsis cuc2 
cuc3 double mutant, although the SAM is slightly larger, plas-
tochron is slightly shorter, and parameter Γ is slightly lower, 
post SAM phyllotactic defects are more profound and caused 
by a different mechanism in cuc2 cuc3, that is, the locally 
reversed order of flower pedicels (Burian et al. 2015). This 
reversed order is caused by fusion between the inflorescence 
stem and flower pedicels, such that the correct flower order 
generated in the SAM cannot be maintained during stem elon-
gation (Burian et al. 2015). Such fusion is consistent with the 
primary role of CUC2 and CUC3 in organ separation (Aida 
et al. 1999; Hibara et al. 2006; Ishida et al. 2000).
Stem torsion
A unique type of post SAM phyllotactic defect is caused by 
stem torsion. Screw palm (Pandanus utilis Bory), for exam-
ple, has a divergence angle of 120° during the leaf initia-
tion process on the SAM. As older leaves move toward the 
periphery, this divergence angle clearly exceeds 120° due 
to stem torsion (Rutishauser 2019). In Arabidopsis, CESA 
INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (CSI1) physically links corti-
cal microtubules and cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes 
to guide cellulose deposition (Bringmann et al. 2012; Li 
et al. 2012). In csi1 mutant, this guidance is lost, and the 
orientation of cellulose microfibrils becomes helical instead 
of transverse. As a result, subtle yet important torsion is 
generated on the inflorescence stem (Landrein et al. 2013). 
Curiously, this torsion is strictly right-handed. Therefore, 
when the direction of phyllotaxis is counter-clockwise, the 
divergence angle, which is unaltered in the SAM, increases, 
whereas when the direction of phyllotaxis is clockwise, the 
divergence angle decreases, thereby leading to a bimodal 
distribution of divergence angles (Landrein et al. 2013). 
Such bimodal distribution of divergence angles is also found 
in Arabidopsis spiral2 (spr2) mutant, which has impaired 
orientation of cortical microtubules and exhibits stem tor-
sion (Landrein et al. 2013). In contrast to csi1 and spr2, 

393

wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) screwed spike rachis (scr) 
mutant exhibits inflorescence stem torsion in either the left-
handed or the right-handed direction. As a result, although 
the spikelet phyllotaxis is still distichous, angular positions 
of all spikelets are shifted uniformly (Amagai et al. 2017). 
The exact function of SCR is unknown, though this type of 
stem torsion is not related to α-tubulin (Amagai et al. 2017).
Conclusion and perspectives
The classic literature has enriched our knowledge on phyllo-
tactic pattern identification and phyllotactic parameter quan-
tification, but in the past 20 years, phyllotaxis research has 
advanced from morphological and quantitative approaches 
to molecular genetics combined with live imaging and com-
puter modeling. Molecular markers have enabled a small 
population of cells in the SAM to be identified as the “init-
ium” 1–2 plastochrons before these cells display any detect-
able physical change. The many exciting findings include the 
pivotal role of auxin and its polar transport, and numerous 
regulators and pathways that maintain, affect, regulate, and 
control phyllotaxis in various ways. It has become apparent 
that the physiological roles of these regulators and pathways 
are not specific for phyllotaxis. In other words, there are 
no specific “phyllotaxis genes”. Moreover, each quantifi-
able phyllotactic parameter can be analyzed and dissected 
by molecular genetics. The sheer morphological beauty of 
phyllotaxis that we appreciate is the manifestation of many 
regulators exerting their respective effects in a coordinated 
fashion either directly or indirectly in the SAM.
Despite recent advances in understanding how phyllo-
taxis is regulated at the molecular level, our knowledge is 
still limited, and many important questions remain to be 
answered. How do we explain the superposition of whorls 
and centrifugal (intercalated) primordia initiation, both of 
which are common in acacia phyllodes (Rutishauser 1999, 
2016) and some flowers (Lacroix and Sattler 1988; Ronse De 
Craence 2010)? PIN1-independent regulatory mechanisms 
have been suggested to determine divergence angle in the 
vegetative phase of Arabidopsis (Guenot et al. 2012), and 
what are these mechanisms? What are the targets of PLA 
genes in regulating plastochron in the vegetative phase, and 
how is plastochron regulated in the reproductive phase? 
Can we develop computer models capable of simulating a 
non-circular SAM (as observed in some mutants and bifur-
cated SAM), thus verifying and predicting rare phyllotactic 
patterns? In addition, almost all recent advances are from 
angiosperms, even though phyllotaxis is a phenomenon that 
can be observed in all plant lineages from algae (Linardic 
and Braybrook 2017; Peaucelle and Couder 2016). There-
fore, in an evolutionary context, whether our understanding 
of phyllotaxis of angiosperms holds true for other lineages, 
and to what extent, remains to be investigated. Combining 
molecular genetics with powerful analytical tools such as 
omics analysis (Peng et al. 2017) and genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (Leiboff et al. 2015), we should gain a much 
better understanding of phyllotaxis, a query of nature lasting 
more than a century.
