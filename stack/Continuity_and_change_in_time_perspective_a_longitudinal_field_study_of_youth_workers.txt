ABSTRACT  
Blaze Aylmer 
 
The current temporal research agenda in time and organizations emphasizes the 
importance of continuity and change. This research sought to examine the coexistence of 
continuity and change in time perspective using the model proposed by (Zimbardo and 
Boyd, 1999).  
The research sought answers to the following four research questions: 
 
1.  Do time perspectives demonstrate differential continuity?  
2.  Do time perspectives demonstrate mean level continuity? 
 
3.  Do time perspectives demonstrate interindividual differences  
 
in intraindividual change? 
 
 
4.  Do individuals demonstrate individual change in their time perspectives?  
 
 
Survey data were collected from 128 youth workers across three measurement occasions 
using a twelve month prospective longitudinal panel design and measurement occasions 
were separated by a four month interval. Data were analysed using retest correlations, 
individual stability coefficients, latent growth modeling and the reliable change index. 
Time perspectives demonstrated rank order continuity and there was evidence of 
individual variation in stability. Although there was a decline in rank order continuity, it 
was not statistically significant. Time perspectives showed mean level continuity but did 
not demonstrate interindividual differences in intraindividual change. However, evidence 
of individual differences in change was indicated by the reliable change index across all 
time perspectives. The findings supported the co-existence of continuity and change in 
time perspectives. The research makes a methodological and theoretical contribution. 
Methodologically, the research contributes to a more thorough understanding of 
continuity and change in time perspective and provides different answers to the question, 
do time perspectives change? Theoretically, the research advocates an alternative 
perspective which questions current assumptions.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The current temporal research agenda suggests that researchers should examine 
dynamic relationships, temporal relations and long term stability and change (Roe, 2008). 
To add to the present temporal research agenda, this research examines continuity and 
change in the dispositional view of time perspective advocated by Zimbardo & Boyd, 
(1999). Time perspective is considered to be a time related individual difference variable 
and is defined as ―the often nonconscious process whereby the continual flows of personal 
and social experiences are assigned to temporal categories, or time frames, that help to 
give order, coherence, and meaning to those events,‖ (Zimbardo & Boyd 1999, p.1271). 
The authors identified five time perspectives: past positive, past negative, present 
fatalism, present hedonism and future time perspective. 
Time perspectives are currently related to a few organizational applications. 
Organizational scholars are developing their knowledge of time. Actors relate to time 
(Ancona et al., 2001), and one way we relate to time is through our time perspectives. 
Time perspectives are important to organizational research in the area of teams (Waller et 
al., 2001; Arman and Adair, 2013), organizational change (Huy, 2001) and managing 
procrastination in the work place (Gupta et al., 2012). Arman and Adair (2013) theorize 
that present oriented teams will focus on short term goals relative to future oriented teams. 
Time perspective as an individual difference has a role to play in recruitment and 
selection. Greening behaviour is a current focus of attention in organizations (Andersson 
et al., 2013) and Milfont et al. (2007) have shown that a present oriented time perspective 
is negatively related to environmental values while a future time perspective is positively 
related to environmental values. Clearly, time perspectives have a role in recruitment and 

 
2 
 
selection to promote environmental values, to screen against present fatalism and recruit 
the required individuals into the appropriate team roles.  Given the above, it is clear that 
time perspective has a role to play in organizational research. The present research differs 
from the existing body of literature in that it examines stability and change in time 
perspectives. 
Time perspective can be regarded as a stable individual difference variable which 
predicts many different outcomes and it has ramifications for educational achievement.  
The research found that female instructors working with early school leavers 
demonstrated higher mean levels of present fatalism relative to male instructors and those 
in managerial roles. Previous research has shown that present fatalism is negatively 
related to educational achievement (Phan, 2009). The impression given in the current time 
perspective literature is that time perspectives are stable. 
The research findings challenge this view by taking a broader interpretation of 
stability and change which shows that they are more useful if broken down into group and 
individual level indices. The findings indicate the presence of rank order stability and 
mean level stability; however, there are individual differences in change across all five 
time perspectives. Researchers need to understand the duration of stability (George and 
Jones, 2000), otherwise time perspective remains timeless. From a practical perspective, 
instructors working with early school leavers should be able to reduce  the average level 
of  present fatalism, however, current thinking would indicate that there is little one can 
do to alter time perspectives which ensures that time perspective research remains 
timeless. Time perspective researchers supporting the model of Zimbardo and Boyd 
(1999) continue to replicate this belief by not attending to time and reflecting what is 
rather than what happens (Roe, 2008). Theoretically, time perspectives are adaptable, yet 
we cannot describe the adapting time perspective. It is important for professionals 

 
3 
 
working with early school leavers to maintain a future time perspective that emphasizes 
the future as an achievement space from which learners might benefit. Professionals with 
high past negative and present fatalism time perspectives should recognize that these 
perspectives are not conducive to the role of an effective instructor. The main concern 
raised from a temporalist perspective is that time perspective is considered as a process 
but measured as a variable which reflects a methodological misfit. By continuing to treat 
time perspective as a stable individual difference variable researchers deprive themselves 
of understanding how time perspectives change which is central to intervention. Time 
perspectives are open to the influence of context (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) but, we do 
not know if the context of working with the early school leaver reduces future time 
perspective of new instructors and increases present fatalism. Time perspective 
researchers are unclear about describing the process of an unfolding time perspective in 
terms of improvement, bifurcation and relapse (Roe, 2008). 
The study of continuity and change is subtle because it invokes a challenge to 
existing thinking by focusing on the coexistence of continuity and change rather than on 
their mutual exclusivity which reflects the current description of time perspective. The 
current description of time perspective is inadequate because it is characterized by a 
predominant view that rank order consistency implies that time perspectives are stable 
over time. The inadequacy is addressed by adopting a multilevel and multifaceted view of 
continuity and change.  
The coexistence of continuity and change is a well-established line of investigation 
within organizational research and personality development. Long term continuity and 
change are important because they force scholars to update their understanding of the 
extant knowledge (Roe, 2005). Secondly, the study of continuity and change forces 
researchers to theorize about the reasons for continuity and change, and thirdly continuity 

 
4 
 
and change focuses on the construct as outcome rather than predictor. For example, the 
study of continuity and change in personality development has led to a number of 
theoretical principles explaining why personality changes and why it does not (Roberts et 
al. 2008). 
Organizational research has examined the co-existence of continuity and change at 
strategic, organization, team and individual level of analysis. At a strategic level, 
researchers investigate continuity and change in competitive advantage using the work of 
(Porter,1987) and (D‘aveni,1995). Competitive dynamics are illustrated in the 
hypercompetition literature which illustrates that competitive advantage is temporary and 
fleeting while (Porter, 1987) advocates sustainable competitive advantage by adopting a 
unique industry position.  
At the organizational level, continuity and change are evident in models of 
punctuated equilibrium at the organizational level (Romanelli & Tushman, 1994). This 
model suggests that organizations experience periods of both continuity and change. At 
the team level, (Gersick, 1988) demonstrated the importance of the midpoint transition 
which disrupts team activity and realigns it with the remaining time to a deadline. 
Personality development researchers have shown the coexistence of continuity and 
change in personality which has provided a more detailed and richer description of 
individual and group level continuity and change (Roberts et al., 2001; Caspi & Roberts, 
2001; Branje et al., 2004; Caspi et al., 2005; Fraley & Roberts, 2005; Roberts et al., 2005; 
van Aken et al., 2006; Branje et al., 2007; Lodi-Smith & Roberts, 2007; Roberts & 
Mroczek, 2008; Roberts et al., 2008; Klimstra et al., 2009). These research findings 
conclude that continuity and change are not mutually exclusive, but are independent and 
multifaceted.   
The coexistence of continuity and change in personality has challenged the questions 

 
5 
 
about whether personality has changed or remains the same. Personality development 
researchers highlight that discussions on continuity or change tend to focus on one aspect 
of continuity, namely rank order continuity. Continuity and change can coexist at the 
group and individual level which gives rise to a number of interpretations (Roberts et al 
2008), namely rank order, and mean level, individual differences structural and ipsative 
continuity and these are presented in a theoretical framework in Figure 2.  
The framework is used to invoke three problematizing assumptions: in-house, 
paradigmatic and ideological (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011). These assumptions highlight 
that the theme of continuity and change is subsumed to the background which has led to a 
significant shortage of theory explaining when and why time perspective demonstrates 
change and continuity. The lack of theory means that present research is guided by a set of 
research questions rather than formal hypothesis. Research questions are presented after 
time perspective is problematized rather than following chronologically from each 
chapter. 
By placing time perspective within these frameworks, the current description of 
continuity and change in time perspective is inadequate. Although there is evidence 
supporting the rank order consistency and mean level change in time perspective, this 
evidence is based on group level measures. The study of continuity and change invokes 
the plasticity principle which indicates that time perspectives are defined as open systems 
that can be influenced by the environment at any age (Robert et al., 2008). The plasticity 
principle undermines the assumption that time perspectives are stable. The belief that time 
perspectives are stable is a convenience because it allows researchers to predict outcomes 
using various time perspectives. By situating time perspectives within discussions on 
continuity and change, time perspective becomes central and a richer and more thorough 
description can be found, thereby addressing the present inadequacy. Plasticity is central 

 
6 
 
to the temporalist perspective which argues that all things are open to change. 
The contribution of the present research is twofold. The first contribution is 
methodological which provides a more thorough description of continuity and change in 
time perspective, thereby addressing the claim of inadequacy. Despite rank order and mean 
level continuity, there are individual differences in change across the time perspectives 
developed by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999), and there is variation in individual stability 
coefficients in all five time perspectives. The contribution to theory advances the temporalist 
research agenda by placing time perspective as a disposition within a set of revised 
assumptions which researchers can make about time perspectives i.e. they are capable of 
both change and continuity, and they can demonstrate reliable change in relatively short 
periods of time. 
POSITIONING THE RESEARCH 
The present study examines the extent to which individuals demonstrate continuity 
and change in their orientation toward the past, present and future. Figures 1 and 2 are 
used to position the research. Figure 1 shows the literatures used to position the 
investigation and Figure 2 provides the framework by which to investigate the research 
topic.

The current temporal research agenda encourages the investigation of long term 
stability and change (Roe, 2008). The overarching assumption made by time perspective 
researchers is that it is stable and this view is questioned under the temporal research 
agenda. Problematization is used to surface taken for granted assumptions underpinning 
the dispositional view of time perspective which draws on a conceptualization of 
continuity and change in personality development research which suggests that continuity 
and change are multilevel and multifaceted.  
In Figure 2, the theoretical framework indicates that continuity and change are 
coterminous and are multilevel. The framework has been used extensively in personality 
development research to show that personality demonstrates both continuity and change 
and it is used to explore the dispositional view of time perspective espoused by 
Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). By using this conceptualization of continuity and change, the 
present description of time perspective as a disposition is shown to be inadequate.

The research found that female instructors working with early school leavers 
demonstrated higher mean levels of present fatalism relative to male instructors and those 
in managerial roles.  Previous research has shown that present fatalism is negatively 
related to educational achievement (Phan, 2009). The impression given in the current time 
perspective literature is that time perspectives are stable. It is important for professionals 
working with early school leavers to maintain a future time perspective that emphasizes 
the future as an achievement space from which learners might benefit. Professionals with 
high past negative and present fatalism time perspectives should recognize that these 
perspectives may not be conducive to the role of an effective instructor. 
Time perspective researchers supporting the model of Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) 
continue to replicate what is, rather than what happens (Roe, 2008). Theoretically, time 
perspectives are adaptable, yet we cannot describe the adapting time perspective. The 
main concern raised from a temporalist perspective is that time perspective is considered 
as a process but measured as a variable which reflects a methodological misfit. By 
continuing to treat time perspective as a stable individual difference variable, researchers 
gain little understanding of how time perspectives change. Time perspective researchers 
are unclear about describing the process of an unfolding time perspective in terms of 
improvement, bifurcation and relapse (Roe, 2008). The findings indicate that individuals 
can adapt their time perspectives; however time perspective researchers lack the tools to 
temporalize it. Time perspectives are not considered in the context of onset, duration and 
offset Roe (2008), which gives the appearance that they do not evolve and change over an 
interval. The practical importance of the findings is to critique this view and build a bidge 
toward temporalist thinking.

CONTRIBUTION 
 
The study represents a contribution to the literature in the following ways. 
 The research has addressed the temporal research agenda by examining issue of 
continuity and change in time perspective which remains largely overlooked. The 
research findings show that time perspectives can demonstrate plasticity in an adult 
sample and questions the continued preoccupation with supporting the validity status 
of time perspective as a disposition. 
 The investigation brings time perspective in line with personality development 
literature and achievement goal stability studies which demonstrate that continuity 
and change are multilevel and coterminous. 
 The findings question the trait like interpretation of time perspective by showing that 
time perspectives can demonstrate individual differences in change.  
 The research challenges the assumption that rank order consistency is interpreted as 
the main indicator of continuity and despite rank order consistency, individuals 
demonstrate intraindividual variation in their stability coefficients. 
 Methodologically, the study provides a more rigorous approach to continuity and 
change using a variety of different methods. 
 The study is a longitudinal field study which represents a departure from the 
traditional two period designs adopted by time perspective researchers who make 
extensive use of university students.  
 The plasticity of time perspective shows that time perspectives are somewhat 
adaptable over a number of weeks and this finding suggests a role for time perspective 
interventions.

THESIS STRUCTURE 
  
Chapter one reviews the different philosophical positions underpinning time in the 
natural and social sciences and it presents a summary of many times. Chapter two 
presents‘ different times using organizations and develops the theme of continuity and 
change within organizational literature to show that they are multilevel and coterminous. 
The chapter marks the dispositional view time perspective as the focus of study. Chapter 
three presents a detailed discussion on the different schools of thought investigating time 
perspective and attends to the dispositional view of time perspective presented by  
(Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and measured by the Zimbardo and Boyd Time Perspective 
Index (ZTPI). Chapter four outlines the antecedents and outcomes of the model of time 
perspective developed by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). Chapter five uses a 
problematization lens to generate the research questions about continuity and change in 
time perspective using personality development literature. Chapter six presents the 
research paradigm and methods adopted in the research. An evaluation of the statistical 
approaches chosen, data analysis and results are presented in chapter seven. The 
discussion of the study‘s findings is outlined in chapter eight and chapter nine advances 
the research conclusionsand limitations.

CHAPTER 1 
INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ON 
TIME 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The central concern of the present research is continuity and change in time perspective.  
 
The chapter is divided into three sections. The layout of the chapter is presented in 
Figure 3. The first section presents a diverse view of philosophical perspectives on time, 
section two outlines different times: physical time, biological time, social time, practice 
based views and psychological time. In section three of the chapter, the theme of 
continuity and change is selected for discussion because it is shaped by philosophical 
perspectives and it is central to the temporal research agenda in organizations. The chapter 
concludes by suggesting that discussions on being and becoming are a central temporal 
theme which shapes debate on continuity and change in time related individual 
differences.

1.1 PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES 
  
The first section of chapter one shows that philosopher‘s conceptualized time in 
terms of the physical, psychological and social worlds. Early work by philosophers focused 
on the question of what is time. Scholars have struggled to answer the question (Elias 1992 
cited in Lawrence, 1986; Lobo, 2008), but still they do not know what time is (Davies, 
2006). 
1.1.1Philosophical perspective-physical time 
Time in the physical universe was contemplated by Aristotle as ―an aspect of great 
motions of the cosmos, embodied in numerable years, numerable months, and numerable 
days‖ (Lawrence, 1986,p.24). Plato suggested that time represents the moving image of 
eternity while the stoics regarded time in the cosmos as cyclical and they contemplated 
the eternal return. The eternal return refers to a cyclical theory of time where states of the 
universe will, after enormous periods of time repeat themselves as they did in the past and 
will repeat themselves again in the future (Capek, 1960). The Roman philosopher Plotinus 
(205-270 AD) commented that time among the Greeks was conceptualized three ways: (1) 
motion -all motion or motion of celestial bodies (2) as a moving celestial sphere and (3) 
the extent or number of motion (Roeckelein 2008). Aristotle‘s view on time remained 
influential until the work of St. Augustine, who contemplated psychological time. 
1.1.2 Philosophical perspective-psychological time  
St. Augustine contemplated time and conceptualized it as a subjective experience 
and these deliberations laid the foundation for the psychology of time. Rather than 
focusing on physical time, Augustine argued that time is in the mind. Furthermore, 
Augustine connected the past with memory, the present with attention and the future with 
expectation (Roeckelein, 2008). Time as a feature of the mind was further developed by 

 
14 
 
the French philosopher Guyau (1854-1888), who argued that time is a mental construction 
and ―temporal experience is constructed based on the intensity, number and attention paid 
of stimuli‖ (Roeckelein 2008, p.18).  
Augustine faced a dilemma of time felt versus time understood (Fraser, 1987). This 
dilemma is explained by Fraser using the development of brain structures where time felt 
resides in very old parts of the brain (brain stem) while time understood reflects the 
thinking parts of our brain (cerebral cortex). Time felt is largely inaccessible to language 
and cognitive processing and hence time felt is not easily articulated. Time understood 
reflects the temporal reality that is accessible and interpretable to our minds.  
Considerations of time by early philosophers were largely grounded in physical reality 
until Augustine who focused philosophical discussion on psychological time which 
emphasizes human experience of time. Psychological time is examined from the 
perspective of the individual; however, time was also conceptualized as having a social 
nature. 
1.1.3 Philosophical perspectives-social time  
Philosophical positions held by George Herbert Mead and Husserl focused on the 
subjective nature of time which emphasized its social construction. According to  
Wood (2001), Husserl brought a phenomenological perspective to the study of time which 
began with the complete exclusion of all assumptions about objective time. Husserl 
dispensed with assumptions that there is a single all-embracing time and suggested that 
objective time is constituted through our experience. Husserl focused on our inner 
subjective time which was also a significant preoccupation for Bergson.  
In his account of Bergson‘s philosophy,  Moore (1996) outlines that events are 
temporally ordered in the succession of our experience. The segregation of our experience 
into discrete categories is necessary for human beings, but this discreteness is unreal. 

 
15 
 
Bergson‘s writings critiqued the physical view of time as a social convenience, he 
regarded duration or Dureé as a continuous progression of time where past, present and 
future are fused into an unbroken flux (Roeckelein, 2000). It is the Dureé that is real, ―it is 
a property of going through time‖ (Moore, 1996, p.58), rather than measured duration. 
For Bergson, past and future are contained in the present and time exists through internal 
states of consciousness where time is considered as creation (Bergson, 1959, cited in 
Bergada, 1990). The sociologist Perleau-Monty, considered time as the construction of the 
world as directly experienced by human beings  (Merleau-Ponty 1962, cited in Bergadaa, 
1990).  Time may be regarded as an orientation tool  (Elias 1992, cited in Šubrt, 2001)and 
according to Elias, time refers to a relative framework which helps to create points of 
orientation in a continual flow of changes (Šubrt, 2001). The seasons, natural 
phenomenon such as the sun‘s movement, lunar cycle and events act as orientation points 
which become standardized. Time is described as a symbol  ―for a relationship that groups 
of humans…set between two or more courses of events, of which one is taken as a 
relative framework  or measure for the standardization  of the others   (Elias 1992, cited in 
Šubrt, 2001, p.213). 
The seminal paper by Sorokin and Merton (1937) proposed that social time is 
heterogeneous and they drew attention to the different meanings attributed to events in 
calendrical time. There are many social times which are described by scholars as time in 
events (Adam, 1990). Social time or epochal time is defined by events rather than being 
independent of time (Bluedorn & Standifer, 2006). Sociologists argue for a social theory 
of time which suggests that time is a socially constructed organising devise that is 
inherent in events (Clark, 1985).  Social time refers to ―the patterns and orientations that 
relate to social processes and to the conceptualization of the ordering of social life.‖ 
(Lauer, 1981, p.21). 

 
16 
 
Interdisciplinary philosophical debate has delineated many times which have manifested 
in conceptualizations of time adopted by Newton and Einstein in the physical sciences 
while social science scholars have conceptualized time in a psychological and social 
sense. These philosophical perspectives underpin different times such as physical, 
psychological, social and practice based views of time.  
 1.2 DIFFERENT TIMES 
In the second section of the chapter, different philosophical treatments of time 
support diverse conceptualizations of time in physics, biology, psychology and sociology 
and these are discussed. 
1.2.1 Physical time- Newton and Einstein 
Aristotelian conceptualization of time, as measured by number and its association 
with motion are inherent in Newton‘s time concept. Newton‘s goal was to describe motion 
which is a change in position over time (Falk, 2008). Mathematical time was central to 
Newton‘s theory and he proceeded to distinguish mathematical time from common 
notions of time derived from the motion of celestial bodies  Newtonian physics was built 
around a model of a clockwork universe requiring an undisputed time measure, and 
Newton defined time as ―absolute true and mathematical time, of itself , and from its own 
nature, flows equably without relation to anything external… and by another name is 
called duration‖ (Callendar & Edney, 2001, p.18). This definition of time provided a 
benchmark against which all other clocks were gauged (Falk, 2008).  
Newtonian physics described the universe in terms of a three dimensional space: 
length, width and height, and time is denoted by t, and it is considered as an independent 
variable and has an implied flow and reversibility. Newtonian time is considered within 
science as homogenous for all times and does not recognise the different times inherent in 

 
17 
 
science such as rhythms, tempo, timing, duration or change (Adam,1998). The Newtonian 
view of time or substantivist perspective describes time as a neutral medium containing 
events, and is defined as a time in events approach (Levine, 2003). Newtonian mechanics 
played a central role in physics until Einstein.  
Einstein‘s Theory of Special Relativity (SRT) demonstrated that time was not 
independent of events and it does not flow. Special relativity theory draws on space-time 
which represents a four dimensional block description of the universe. The block time 
model of the universe is formed by three dimensions and time is the fourth dimension. 
Under SRT the physical universe has no unique position of ‗now‘. Block time is a 
description of nature that gives no privileged position to the present and denies any 
process that would give rise to the flow of time (Davies, 2002). The block universe theory 
suggests that the passage of time is either an illusion or is a feature of the subjective mind 
(Ellis, 2006). The model of the universe in physics is static.  
Conceptualizations of time in the natural sciences is multilevel in that different times 
apply to different levels of nature (Fraser, 1987). Fraser‘s analysis of time indicates the 
importance of an organic present which refers to the ―instant-by-instant synchronization 
that assures the necessary collective viability …of all life forms‖ (Fraser, 1987, p.128). 
Human beings, as biological organisms contain these life sustaining processes which 
reflect biological time. 
1.2.2 Biological time 
Biological time is concerned with the synchronisation of biological reactions so that 
an organism remains alive or at least comes to no harm. Biological time is described by  
an orchestra metaphor where the instant by instant synchronization of rhythms and cycles  
occurs in the organic present (Fraser, 1987). Biological time covers rhythms, cycles, 
oscillations, biological clocks, synchronization and entrainment of oscillatory processes at  

 
18 
 
different levels of analysis ranging from cells to organisms (McGrath and Kelly, 1986).  
Biological rhythms such as the circadian rhythm are of central importance to human 
functioning. The circadian rhythm is defined as ― the oscillations in the behavioural 
physiology and biochemical functions with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours,‖ 
(Bhagwat, 2002, p.37). Circadian rhythms have three basic features: they are 
endogenously generated, the period of circadian rhythm is maintained at a constant value 
across a range of external temperatures and circadian rhythms are entrained to the  
day/night cycle (Bhagwat, 2002). With evolution and brain development, homosapiens 
learned to (1) represent real objects in a symbolic world, (2) decouple primary 
representations from the present and place them in different temporal categories and (3) 
they 
developed 
symbolic 
representations 
of 
relationships 
among 
secondary 
representations (Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997; Fortunato & Furey, 2009). Biological 
development permitted future thinking, present thinking and past thinking which opens 
discussion on psychological time. 
1.2.3 Psychological time  
Psychological time ―consists of cognitive constructs, images, and symbolic 
representations. It has different dimensions such as the experience of time, time 
perspective, attitudes and beliefs toward time, and the individual‘s behaviour relating to 
time,‖ (Shmotkin & Eyal, 2003, p.259).  
Psychological time is preoccupied with the time related experiences, behaviors and 
judgments (Block & Zakay, 2001). It examines duration, time estimation, succession, time 
perspective (Block 1990) and time related individual differences (Francis-Symthe & 
Robertson, 1999). Succession refers to events that can be organized and perceived 
sequentially and it suggests a passage of our experience from present to past (Fraisse, 
1984). Time estimation describes the processing of time intervals in the range of seconds, 

 
19 
 
minutes and larger time intervals while time perception describes the processing of 
extremely short intervals in the millisecond range (Rammsayer, 2008). Time perspective 
has a range of conceptualizations such as an orientation to the past present and future or 
the extension into the future (Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005) and reflects a level of 
involvement with these temporal categories. 
More recent research on psychological time examines the importance of episodic 
memory. Episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) receives and stores information relating to 
temporally dated episodes or events and temporal spatial–relations among those events. 
Individuals simulate future events which draw on past experience and this capability 
refers to episodic future thought and it permits us to pre-experience one time future events 
(Szpunar, 2010). Episodic memory and episodic future thought are generally described as 
an underlying ability to mentally experience personal events in subjective time  
(Spzunar, 2010). Neuroimaging studies support episodic memory and episodic future 
thought (Okuda et al., 2003; Nyberg et al., 2010; Szpunar, 2010; Szpunar, 2011; Tulving 
& Szpunar, 2012). These studies show that the frontal and temporal lobes are linked with 
recollection of the past and envisioning the future. Damage to these areas means that a 
person lives in a ‗permanent present‘ where they are unable to access very recent or old 
memories.  
1.2.4 Psychological time: time related individual differences 
Psychological time includes time related individual differences which describe how  
individuals relate to time (Ancona et al., 2001b). Time related individual differences 
measure anxiousness about the future (Zaleski, 2005), procrastination, punctuality, 
polychronicity (Conte, 2007), individual time styles (Francis-Symthe and Robertson, 
1999), the level of time urgency (Landy et al., 1991) the extent to which individuals orient 
themselves to past, present and future or time perspective (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) and 

 
20 
 
the extent of individual temporal focus (Shipp et al., 2009). These will be discussed in 
detail in chapter two. The study of psychological time has also been taken up by 
sociologists (Flaherty, 1987; Flaherty, 2003; Flaherty et al., 2005; Flaherty, 2010). This 
research investigates the extent to which people engaged in deliberate behaviours to fill 
time intervals by interpreting duration through the lens of social time. 
1.2.5 Social time  
Social time or subjective time is constructed out of norms, beliefs, the customs and 
practices of individuals and groups (Orlikowski & Yates, 2002). The hallmark of social 
life is a shared temporal reference framework such as clocks, calendars and dating 
systems (Zerubavel, 1977) and these are used to distinguish different social groups. 
Calendars, clocks and dating systems represent social artefacts which are imbued with 
meaning. All times are not the same and the different times are often presented within a 
hierarchy (McGrath & Kelly, 1986; Fraser, 1987), and the conceptualization of times in 
the hierarchy has led to significant debate about time. 
To summarize, philosophical perspectives conceive of time as connected with the 
physical, mental and social worlds. In these worlds, time is related to physical reality 
through motion, in the mental world time is described as psychological time and in the 
social world there is social time. These times are different and are divided by rancorous 
debate. 
1.3 INTERDISCIPLINARY TIME DEBATES  
The third section of the chapter discusses an on-going debate of being and becoming 
which is one of many philosophical debates on time. 
Physical time, biological time, social time and psychological time are immersed in cross 
disciplinary debates and these are summarized in Table 1 and it indicates that scholars are 

 
21 
 
divided in their views of time. In the physical universe, time does not flow, the past, 
present, future are illusions and time is simply a variable or a fourth dimension. 
In Table 1 it is evident that social and natural scientists differ in their views. The practical 
reality of time‘s passage is evident in human affairs because psychologists and 
sociologists study thinking beings that have evolved biological brain structures to 
conceive of a past, present and future. With time, individuals and societies change- there 
is both being and becoming. Time‘s arrow indicates a unidirectional passage of time from 
past to future. The deterministic nature of the arrow of time is denied by psychologists 
and sociologists on the grounds that human beings have free will; they are agentic and can 
respond in novel ways to situations. The deterministic view of time‘s arrow is also 
problematic for sociologists because societal progress is based on creating instability 
rather than stability (Adam, 2010). The debate that is central to the present research is 
continuity and change which has its origins in discussions of being and becoming. 
1.3.1 Being and becoming 
Continuity and change have their origins in early philosophical debate between those 
who viewed the physical world as static (Being) and protagonists who described the world 
as ever changing (Becoming) and this discussion is still on-going in present philosophical 
debate. The debate is examined in terms of substance and process philosophies. Substance 
philosophy subscribes to being and denies becoming while process philosophy advocates 
becoming but does not deny being. Being and becoming in the physical universe are 
central to discussions on stability and change (Martone, 2004) and these are argued  
amongst proponents of substance and process philosophies.

Being has its roots in philosophical perspectives of Aristotle and Plato which suggested 
that the world consists of hard and unchanging substances which endure (Mesle, 2008). 
The unchanging being forms the cornerstone of western thinking, which seeks certainty in 
its scientific laws. Eleatics such as Parmenides denied the reality of change, the past and 
future are illusions, and he argued that objects either existed or they did not and there was 
no temporal becoming or mediating stages of change. Parmenides attempted to eliminate 
time (Cornford, 1976) by denying temporal becoming because temporal becoming 
includes all change.  
For Parmenides, change implies that something ―which was not comes to be …and 
as such it was not before ‖ (Cornford, 1976,p.142).The present is the only reality and 
terms like perishing and becoming are meaningless. An alternative perspective was 
offered by Heraclitus who suggested that the only permanent reality is that of change 
while permanence amounted to an illusion of the senses (Roeckelein, 2008). 
Temporal becoming can be considered as the movement of the present in the direction of 
the future or it refers to a ―change in the ontological states of events from unactualized to 
actualized‖ (Riggs, 2007, p.80). Physicists, in general deny temporal becoming because it 
infers the passage of physical time in the universe.  
Temporal becoming was an essential feature of Heraclitus‘s philosophy because all 
things contained opposites within them such as life and death, and the only reality was 
transition or becoming (Roeckelein, 2008). Heraclitus‘s thinking is embodied within 
process philosophy which does not deny substance, but reconceptualises substance as 
process (Rescher, 1996). Process philosophy stresses the centrality of time as passage, the 
becoming and perishing of events (Mesle, 2008). Substance metaphysics has a difficulty 
with future things because the future does not yet exist. Within the social sciences, being 
and becoming are everywhere and are conceptualized differently and according to 

 
24 
 
Harrison ( 2002, p.12) ―to say that nothing changes contradicts our experience‖. Being 
and becoming are conceptualized in the context of the flow of time, being is synonymous 
with the present, while becoming is future oriented (Uprichard, 2008). In contrast to 
substance philosophy, process philosophy is preoccupied with the unfolding of human 
experience and can accommodate the future because the process and nature of reality 
implies that the present constitution of things will always project itself into an unrealized 
and open future (Rescher,1996). 
Prigongine (1980, cited in Uprichard, 2008) suggests that being and becoming 
reflects an arrow of time which is unidirectional. Being and becoming are emphasized in 
identity development, the progression of individual from childhood to adulthood and in 
youth transitions (Worth, 2009). Being and becoming are central to (Grosz, 1998, cited in 
Worth, 2009, p.1055) who conceptualizes time, not as a medium which frames life, but 
―as open to futurity – random, open ended and always becoming,‖ Grosz gives special 
attention to the future where the complex processes of becoming unfold. Being and 
becoming are central to social sciences because they reflect our experience: Being is 
present, becoming invokes the future.  
Themes of being and becoming are also emphasized by Heidegger. Heidegger 
suggests that human beings are inherently temporal, but not in a chronological sense. 
Central to Heidegger‘s philosophy was the Da-sein or consciousness of being possessed 
by human beings. Heidegger linked human existence to time through questions about the 
being of human beings. Being is what it means for a person to exist between birth and 
death and existence is described as ordinary existence in the world (Critchley, 2009). 
Human beings are defined by their mortality and so they are always being toward death. 
The realization that we are mortal makes us aware that our futures are filled with 
possibilities if we desire to capitalize on them. The past reflects our thrownness in the 

 
25 
 
world or that we find ourselves somewhere in the world, but this thrownness is not fixed, 
we can change it through action. We project ourselves toward the future, and projection is 
interpreted as freedom of the human being to demonstrate potential. In projecting 
ourselves toward the future, we project ourselves toward death which pulls us toward 
recognition of our possibilities.  
Heidegger did not emphasize the passage or flow of time (Sheehan, 2003), but 
becoming, alreadiness and presence in the world (Sheehan, 1998). Alreadiness manifests 
itself in a becoming of the finality of death. Presence is characterized in the embracing of 
the mortality one has, which makes the human being meaningfully present to itself and 
allows the human being to make other entities meaningful to it. Becoming suggests that 
human beings are not static entities, human beings become possibilities including death, 
and being thrown into possibilities allows human beings to engage in purposeful action 
(Sheehan, 2003). We have a past, we move through the present and we project our 
possibilities on a future. Heidegger‘s Time concept consists of a unity of past, present and 
future and time is movement through the world as a space of possibilities  
(Karpowicz, 2001). 
To summarize, scholars have defined time in terms of motion, creation, symbols, the 
social construction of the world and psychological attributes. These time concepts 
evolved from cross disciplinary debate on time from the philosophical, natural science, 
sociological and psychological inputs. The diversity of input signposts acrimonious 
debate around continuity and change, times arrow, past present and future and the passage 
of time. The theme of continuity and change has provoked significant discussion across 
the social and physical sciences where lines are drawn between those who favour being 
and those who advocate for becoming.

1.4 CHAPTER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Philosophical debate reflects different times which operate at different units of 
analysis. In the physical universe time is denoted by t, and is used to calculate the motions 
of bodies in space using Newton‘s Laws.  Time has been spatialized in Relativity theory 
to form space-time in order to describe a block universe using four dimensions. These 
treatments of time disagree on the grounds that under Newton‘s perspective, time flows 
while Relativity disagrees with the passage of time in the physical universe. The physical 
world is replete with other times such as biological rhythms and pacers which facilitate 
life sustaining biological reactions. 
At other levels of analysis time is connected with our social context in which we 
create different times.  Societies construe time in different ways such as clock time which 
is a social construction in itself. Psychological time focuses on the flow of our experience 
which contradicts the view of time in the physical science which regards the flow of time 
as an illusion. 
An on-going debate among philosophers relates to being and becoming. Being 
reflects a static conceptualization of reality which rejects change and change is at best an 
illusion. Process philosophy advocates becoming, but does not deny being, rather it 
reconceptualises being as a set of processes. Process philosophy examines the flow of our 
experience which unfolds over time. Substance and process perspectives treat time 
differently in that the future does not yet exist under substance and hence is unreal while 
process philosophy regards the future as open because our experience flows from the 
present into the future. The practical implications of being and becoming are that, being 
plays a role in shaping how theories are developed, it is a philosophical position 
advocating stability and denying change and underlies the development of scientific laws 

 
27 
 
especially within time related individual differences literature.  
To conclude the chapter, there are many times and opinion about time is diverse, 
contradictory and controversial. Time is treated differently depending on the unit of 
analysis ranging from massive matter to human beings. Human beings occupy different 
worlds where at one level they are uncovering nature‘s laws which must be invariant for 
all time, and at another level they occupy a social and psychological world which invokes 
meaning and experience. Transgressing these worlds implies that times differ and the 
unfolding of our experience is legitimate at one level of analysis and is denied at others.  
The debate of being and becoming is not confined to physics and philosophy, but forms 
on-going discussion within organizations which are at the nexus of many times.

CHAPTER 2 
TIME IN ORGANIZATIONS 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The aim of the chapter is to demonstrate that organizations are pluritemporal, they 
demonstrate multilevel aspects of continuity and change and recent organizational 
developments have attended to time in a variety of ways. 
 
The chapter is divided into three sections. Section one outlines the different times in 
organizations highlighted in chapter one to suggest that organizations are pluritemporal. 
Section two presents multilevel examples of continuity and change in organizations to 
show that these coexist and that time related individual differences are at odds with 
organizational research. Section three discusses recent developments in organizations in 
terms of time related research agendas and centres the themes of continuity and change in 
time perspective, a time related individual difference variable, which is central to the 
present research. The chapter concludes by arguing that the themes of continuity and 
change are multilevel and coterminous at different levels of analysis in organizations.

2.1 ORGANIZATIONS AS PLURITEMPORAL 
In the first section of chapter two, organizations are shown to be pluritemporal. 
The various time concepts presented in chapter one are evident in organizations.  
Table 2 provides an overview of different times in organizations, however, the table 
presents these different times as discrete, but they are not. The coexistence of different 
times in organizations is not new (McGrath & Kelly, 1986) and a description of 
simultaneous times is difficult, but it can be achieved using a project chart as an 
organizing device (Yakura, 2004).   
Within organizations, there are different time concepts, activities are mapped to time 
and individuals relate to time in different ways (Ancona et al., 2001). Gantt charts are 
considered to be an organizational artefact (Yakura, 2004) or a modifiable temporal 
structure (Orlikowski & Yates, 2002). Gantt charts reflect deadlines, time in teams, 
conceptualizations of time, pacing, entrainment, the economic valuation of time, 
scheduling and time management, and they implicitly assume individual orientations to 
time such as time urgency, polychronicity, and time perspective.  
 2.1.1 Organizations as pluritemporal-clocks, scheduling and deadlines  
Objective time or clock time is a feature of organizational life epitomized by 
deadlines, schedules, timelines and project charts. Clock time is the basic assumption 
underpinning societal management and operation and it is central to organizational control 
and worker productivity, (Lee & Liebenau, 2001). Under clock time, time is viewed as a 
valuable resource which has an economic value (Pfeffer & DeVoe, 2012) and it is 
considered as an asset to be managed (Bucciarelli, 1988). Time management may be 
considered as a set of ―behaviours that aim at achieving an effective use of time while 
performing certain goal directed activities‖ (Claessens et al., 2005,  p.267) and should be 

 
31 
 
considered within the domain of effective time use (Claessens et al., 2009). The effective 
use of time is central to meeting deadlines or project milestones and deadlines are 
assumed to motivate teams and their members to attend to time (Waller et al., 2002).  
Deadlines are linked to biological time in that they act as triggers to increase pacing 
behaviour. 
2.1.2 Organizations as pluritemporal- biological time  
Biological time in organizations addresses the entraining of human activity in 
organizations to other exogenous cycles or activities. Scheduling, allocation, coordinating 
activity and convergence of effort does not happen in a vacuum. Strong temporal cues or 
zeitgebers are used to explain how activities can mesh together or how the pace of 
activities becomes synchronized within an organization (Bluedorn, 2002). The zeitgeber is 
a cue or entraining force that captures another rhythm. Examples of zeitgebers include the 
firms‘ external environment, the fiscal year, project review cycle and deadlines. 
Entrainment is central to this view and it is defined as ― the process by which one internal 
(or endogenous) rhythmic process is captured and modified by another (endogenous or 
exogenous) rhythmic process‖ (Kelly, 1986, p.89). Entrainment can be used to explain the 
synchronization of cycles and the meshing of management activity to external pacers such 
as the fiscal year. For example, senior managers operating in high velocity environments 
adapted the pace at which decisions were made to compete in fast moving external 
markets (Eisenhardt, 1989; Ancona & Waller, 2007). 
Project charts emphasize deadlines which can act as zeitgebers by motivating teams 
and individuals to accelerate their activities and can influence the tempo aspect of 
entrainment (Bluedorn, 2002). Deadlines are external environmental stimuli that are 
perceived, interpreted and remembered in order to pace activity (Labianca et al., 2005).

Under static deadlines the pace of activity may also be influenced by a midpoint transition 
in punctuated equilibrium models of group behaviour (Gersick, 1988; Gersick, 1989). The 
midpoint transition acts as a temporal marker which allows the group to re-examine their 
previous activities, reorganize them and advance to task completion.  
The midpoint transition allows the group to open itself to the influence of external 
stakeholders (Gersick, 1988). External stakeholders may trigger timing changes which  
produce revisions to project and personal goals (Blount & Janicik, 2001) such as 
deadlines. Under dynamic deadlines, Waller et al. (2002) found that teams did not alter 
pacing behaviour, but attended to time by contracting or expanding time resources as a 
function of deadline proximity. Clock time appears in many guises, but is argued to be 
homogenous for all times and is external to human action. Within organizations, social 
theorists suggest that we construct different times. 
2.1.3 Organizations as pluritemporal-socially constructed times 
The social constructionist view of time suggests that individuals may act agentically 
to create a variety of social times which is evident in timework (Flaherty, 2010). 
Timework is defined as ―individual or interpersonal efforts to create or suppress particular 
kinds of temporal experience,‖ (Flaherty, 2003, p.17). The social construction of time 
appears in the project or Gantt chart (Yakura, 2004). In a study by Yakura (2004), a single 
artefact, the project chart, was interpreted in different ways by different organisational 
members who brought differing assumptions to bear on the interpretation of milestones 
and resources. Instead of the monotemporal time inherent in the project chart, different 
organizational members imbued the chart with different meanings, thereby constructing 
many times such as ―overtime‖, ―down time‖ and ―on time.‖ 
Project charts represents a temporal structure within organizations which is 
reproduced and modified through use. It is in the modification and remodification of 

 
34 
 
temporal structures that one encounters a practice based view of time (Anderson-Gough et 
al., 2001; Orlikowski & Yates, 2002; Ballard & Seibold, 2003; Ballard & Seibold, 2004a; 
Ballard & Seibold, 2004b; Ballard & Seibold, 2006). The practice based view posits that 
humans are shaped by and shape temporal structures that are used in everyday life within 
organizations. Practice based views draw on Giddens structuration theory to study time in 
organizations. Temporal structures can be schedules, deadlines, calendars and weekly 
meetings which are used as guidelines to specify appropriate conduct and they are also 
modified by the actions they inform (Orlikowski & Yates, 2002).  
The practice based lens makes the conception of time within organizations more 
dynamic to show that even well-established temporal structures are malleable. Practice 
based views draw upon human agency which is regarded  
 
―as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in 
its iterational‖ or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a 
―projective‖capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a 
―practical-evaluative‖ capacity to contextualize past habits and 
future projects within the contingencies of the moment). (Emirbayer & Mische, 
1998, p.962). 
 
In their study of electronic media, Orlikowski and Yates (2002) examined a project team 
tasked with creating a standard computer language manual. The study described the 
change in temporal structure adopted by remote IT workers from meetings based on 
adhoc drafts of documentation to more deadline driven outcomes and discussion of draft 
documentation using electronic balloting. 
To summarize, it is clear that organizations are pluritemporal. Clock time invokes 
time: as independent of events, having an economic value and is considered as an asset to 
be managed. Individual and team activities are paced through deadlines. There are other 
times such as practice based and socially constructed times which suggest that time is in 

 
35 
 
events. Times have meanings and a period of clock time may be interpreted differently by 
different social groupings. Practice based views indicate a more dynamic view of social 
time which highlights tensions between continuity of the past and change for the future. 
The theme of continuity and change is further developed using a multi-level perspective 
within organizations in section two. 
2.2 CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONS 
The aim of section two of the chapter is to examine the theme of continuity and 
change in organizations from a multilevel perspective. 
Continuity and change are themes that are reflected in organizations at different levels of 
analysis such as strategic, organizational, group and individual levels. Organizational 
change researchers are recognizing that continuity and change are coterminous and 
coexistent rather than mutually exclusive (Romanelli & Tushman, 1994; Leana & Barry, 
2000; Huy, 2002; Sturdy & Grey, 2003; Nasim & Sushil, 2011; Kaplan & Orlikowski, 
2012). The coexistence of continuity and change is also recognized in models examining 
the impact of change on group structure (Arrow, 1997) and in the stability and 
adaptability of individual differences (Leana & Barry, 2000).  
2.2.1 Continuity and change-strategic level 
At a strategic level, models of competitive advantage contain perspectives based on 
continuity such as Porters five forces model (Porter, 1987) and models of change include 
hypercompetition (D'aveni, 1995). Porter‘s model advocates achievement of a sustainable 
or enduring competitive advantage within industry through adoption of unique strategic 
positions while hyper-competition reflects the constant erosion of temporary advantages 
through swift strategic action. Hypercompetition researchers suggest that enduring 
advantages arising from monopolistic or oligarchical market structures are replaced by a 

 
36 
 
series of temporary advantages (D'Aveni et al., 2010). Monopolistic and oligopolistic 
market behaviour is undermined by high velocity environments which emphasize constant 
change and reinvention (Eisenhardt, 1997; Eisenhardt & Brown, 1998). 
2.2.2 Continuity and change-organizational level 
At an organizational level, continuity and change are featured in the punctuated 
model of change (Romanelli & Tushman, 1994). Punctuated equilibrium models 
demonstrate that organizations experience long periods of stability in their activities 
followed by periods of change brought about by shock which moves the organization to 
another state. The punctuated equilibrium model highlights the tension between stability 
and change (Lant & Mezias, 1992). Stable equilibrium  in the pattern of firm activity is  
achieved through a variety of ways (Romanelli & Tushman, 1994) such as: establishing 
and embedding an initial activity pattern through routines, ensuring fit between the state 
of the external environment and managerial decision making and establishing shared 
meanings.  
2.2.3 Continuity and change–group level 
Continuity and change are evident themes in group development. ―Traditional 
models of group development-the patterning of change and continuity in group structure 
and behaviour over time –propose that groups follow a fixed sequence of stages‖(Arrow, 
1997, p.75). Fixed stage models suggest that groups move through different stages which 
follow a linear sequence from testing and dependence, conflict, group development and 
functional role relatedness (Tuckman, 1965). Arrow (1997) outlines four models of 
continuity and change in group structure and these are outlined in Table 3. The table 
indicates that continuity and change are standard themes in groups who act to either 
stabilize the impact of shocks to preserve existing structures, or adapt to manage them. At 

 
37 
 
the individual level of analysis, continuity is evident in time related individual differences 
that were briefly outlined in chapter one and these are discussed in more detail.  
2.2.4 Continuity-the individual level 
Organizations are at the nexus of various time theories and time concepts where 
actors map activities to time, they relate to time and they work under different 
conceptions of time (Ancona et al., 2001b). We relate to time through time related 
individual differences which were developed using differential thinking. These ―innate 
tendencies influence how individuals structure, organize and make sense of time, thus 
shaping their own temporal preferences, and more generally how people situate their 
time,‖ (Blount & Leroy, 2007, p.163). Organizational scholars borrow theory from 
neighbouring disciplines on the basis that the theory will demonstrate similar results in a 
different context (Whetten et al., 2009). Time related individual differences are borrowed 
with stability in mind, yet they are out of sync with other levels of analysis. 
A selective review of time related individual differences is presented. Individuals 
differ across a range of time related constructs such as time orientation (Zimbardo & 
Boyd, 1999), temporal focus (Shipp et al., 2009), their levels of time urgency (Conte et 
al., 1995; Conte et al., 1998; Conte, 2001; Waller et al., 2001), future anxiety (Zaleski, 
2005), polychronicity (Conte, 2007) and the extent to which individuals perceive time as 
continuous and smooth or purposive and structured (Kaufman-Scarborough & Lindquist, 
1999). A selective overview of these individual differences is presented. 
2.2.4.1 Polychronicity 
Time related individual differences such as polychronicity; temporal focus, time 
urgency, and time perspective have featured in organizational studies. Polychronicity 
refers to the ―extent to which people (1) prefer to be engaged in two or more tasks or

events simultaneously and are actually so engaged….and (2) believe their preference is 
the best way to do things, (Bluedorn, 2002, p. 51); and it can be regarded as a cultural trait 
(Slocombe, 1999) and as a stable individual difference variable (Conte & Jacobs, 
2003,p.124). Monochronic individuals tend to be task oriented; they stress promptness 
and stick to their plans while polychronic individuals tend to alter plans and emphasize 
relationships. Organizational research shows that, among sales executives, polychronicity 
was positively correlated with supervisory ratings of customer service and sales 
performance, (Conte & Gintoft, 2005), group polychronicity and individual time urgency 
are negatively related when a team is required to complete a goal (Waller et al., 1999) and 
polychronicity is positively related to a learning goal orientation and negatively related to 
a performance avoidance goal orientation (Conte & Schell, 2007).  
2.2.4.2 Concern for future consequences and time urgency 
The concern for future consequences (CFC) is a stable individual difference which 
refers to the extent to which an individual weighs the immediate versus distant 
consequences of their actions (Strathman et al., 1994). The concern for future 
consequences is used in the context of social dilemmas which involve trade-offs between 
short term costs and long term benefits. Within the context of organizations, 
organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) is considered to be a social dilemma 
(Joireman et al., 2006). The authors found that employees high on (CFC) may be very 
good employees if they believe that they have a future with the organization.  
2.2.4.3 Time urgency 
Time urgency reflects a multi-dimensional construct which includes factors on: (1) a 
time awareness, (2) eating behaviour (3) scheduling, (4) nervous energy, (5) list making, 
(6) speech pattern and (7) deadline control (Landy et al., 1991), but these were reduced to 

 
40 
 
five dimensions :time awareness, eating behaviour, scheduling, list making and deadline 
control by Conte et al. (1995) Research evidence also indicates that time urgency 
dimensions consist of competitiveness, general hurry, eating behaviour and task hurry 
(Conte, 2001). The researchers found significant and positive correlations between: eating 
behaviour and job involvement, depersonalization and speech patterns and general hurry 
and emotional exhaustion.   
2.2.4.4 Time perspective  
Time perspective refers to the preference an individual has for past, present and 
future (Block, 1990). There are both state and trait measures of time perspective adopted 
in organizations. Time perspective as a state measure is related to pace, linearity, time 
urgency and time scarcity (Ballard & Seibold, 2004a) and time perspective is largely 
depicted as a unidimensional scale measuring past or present or future (Schriber & Gutek, 
1987; Usunier & Valette-Florence, 2007). There are other time perspectives such as the 
transcendental time perspective (Boyd & Zimbardo, 1997) and a limited time perspective 
(Cozzolino et al., 2009), but these are not considered in organizational contexts.  
A broader definition of time perspective suggests that it refers to the ―composite cognitive 
structures that characterize the way an individual projects, collects, assesses ,values and 
organizes events that reside in a distinct temporal foci, (Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005, p.12). 
Time perspective is generally regarded as synonymous with time orientation (Luyckx et 
al., 2010). Time orientation reflects both cognitive structures and the mix of ―individual 
and socially constructed traits‖(Usunier & Valette-Florence, 2007, p.337).  
Organizational researchers have shown relatively little attention to time perspective 
(Waller et al., 2001; Gibson et al., 2008). Waller et al. (2001) combine time perspective with 
time urgency to indicate that different team members can assume roles of organizers, 
crammers, visioners and relators when facing deadlines. Gibson et al. (2008) examine the 

 
41 
 
antecedents and outcomes of time perspective heterogeneity and draw on globalization and 
cultural contexts to present propositions of antecedents, mediators and outcomes of time 
perspective. Time perspective and alliance formation were studied by Thoms et al.(2006) 
who indicated that future time perspective was positively related to alliance formation and 
past negative time perspective was positively related to cooperation.   
The theme of continuity and change is reflected in time related individual differences 
which are assumed to be stable over time. Unlike the organizational literature on continuity 
and change, time related individual differences appear to rely on a one-dimensional view of 
continuity represented by rank order consistency from which researchers conclude that there 
is little change. The individual differences literature in psychology has a history of 
protracted debate on the stability of traits versus their openness to the influence of context in 
the person-situation debate (Roberts & Caspi, 2001; Lewis, 2001).  
The term stability within the individual differences literature appears to have diverse 
meanings. Nomenclature referring to stability and change ranges from consistency and 
change (Cervone, 2004), continuity and change (Caspi & Roberts, 2001) or constancy and 
change (Nesselroade, 1990). Stability can refer to something that is enduring or immutable. 
However, stability and change can refer to group and individual level properties (Roberts et 
al. 2008).To rectify the difficulty with defining stability, the present research draws on a 
multifaceted and multilevel understanding of stability developed by these authors. Stablity 
and change are not seen as opposite ends of a spectrum, but are considered to co-exist and 
are mutually exclusive.These researchers do not associate stability with immutability and 
enduring patterns, but advocate a broader interpretation which permits a more detailed 
description of time perspective relative to existing research. Rather than detract from the 
research topic, the present study will follow a precedent set in the personality literature 
which uses the terms stability, continuity and consistency interchangeably. However, it is 

 
42 
 
important to note that stability as a monolithic view is challenged i.e constructs are stable 
over time or they are not. 
It is a common belief among individual difference researchers that demonstrating 
temporal consistency over time implies the absence of change and this assertion is incorrect 
(Roberts et al., 2006b). The view that temporal stability implies the absence of change has 
been contradicted (Caspi & Roberts, 1999; Caspi & Roberts, 2001; Roberts et al., 2001; 
Caspi et al., 2005; Caspi & Shiner, 2006). Personality development researchers suggest that 
asking if a person‘s personality has remained the same (continuity) or has changed is an 
ambiguous question because there are several meanings to the term continuity (Caspi & 
Roberts, 1999). Continuity in individual differences can be broadly classified into rank 
order, mean level, ipsative and individual differences (Caspi et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 
2008). These different faces of continuity are independent and the existence of one does not 
preclude the occurrence of another. The study of continuity and change in time related 
individual differences has not been considered despite the wider debate about the 
coexistence of continuity and change at higher levels of analysis and within the individual 
differences literature itself.  
To summarize, the theme of continuity and change is ubiquitous in organizations and 
ranges from strategic management to individual differences. Models of continuity and 
change across the different levels of analysis are underpinned by practice based conceptions 
of time and clock time. Practice based views of time explain continuity and change as a 
tension between past habits and envisioning a future in the present. Clock based views of 
time are evident in punctuated models of continuity and change which attend to the duration 
of continuity and change. At each level of analysis, there is consensus about the coexistence 
of continuity and change except for time related individual differences which still remain 
silent. Personality development investigators dispute assumptions that temporal stability or 

 
43 
 
rank order consistency is a blanket term for the absence of change and have moved 
personality to a coexistence perspective.  
Over the past number of years, scholars have embraced philosophical and methodological 
developments which have aided the study of continuity and change such as multiwave 
designs and adopting more time sensitive methods. Section three of the chapter examines 
recent developments in time related research.  
2.3 RECENT THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS  
The purpose of section three is to demonstrate that organizational researchers are 
attending to time related research in different ways. They have embraced process 
epistemology, developed time sensitive theoretical frameworks, emphasized the 
integration of temporally sensitive designs, and examined continuity and change at the 
individual and group level of analysis. 
2.3.1 Recent development-temporal research agenda 
Recent calls for greater emphasis on time in organizations are made by numerous 
researchers (Lee & Liebenau, 1999; George & Jones, 2000; Ancona et al., 2001b; Roe, 
2005; Roe, 2006; Roe, 2008; Roe, 2009; Roe et al., 2012; Sonnentag, 2012; Langley et 
al., 2013) and there is varied guidance on how time related research should proceed. For 
organizational theorists, time can represent a boundary condition for theory (Whetten, 
1989), they may attend to the emergence, development, growth and termination of 
organizational phenomenon (Langley et al., 2013) or they think about time in terms of 
past present and future (George & Jones, 2000) and they develop new time related 
constructs such as temporal focus (Shipp et al., 2009) and team temporal diversity 
(Mohammed & Nadkarni, 2011). Other commentators attend to the temporal research 
agenda by suggesting that researchers should examine timing norms and lags (Ancona et 

 
44 
 
al., 2001a) while others advocate the importance of temporal relationships, dynamic 
features and the study of long term stability and change (Roe, 2008; Roe, 2009; Roe et al., 
2012). It is clear that time related research has proceeded along different levels of analysis 
and along different paths. 
 
2.3.1.1 Rationale for temporal research 
These calls for time related research have emerged for a number of reasons. 
Researchers realise that organizational theories need updating to show how behaviours 
unfold (Sonnentag, 2012). Scholars recognise that knowledge based on cross sectional 
designs is uninformative about growth and development (Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010) 
and that the current weakness facing organizational theory is that it does not describe 
what is happening (Roe, 2008). The temporal research agenda has been addressed at 
different levels of analysis. At a strategic level, scholars continue to: develop 
conceptualizations of time (Kaplan & Orlikowski, 2012) , to examine entrainment and 
rhythm in acquisitions and alliances (Shi & Prescott, 2013) and study time concepts 
underpinning mergers and acquisitions (Shi et al., 2012). At the organizational level, 
investigators theorize about time and fit theory (Shipp & Jansen, 2011) and at the group 
level, researchers study the unfolding dynamic processes in teams (Roe et al., 2012), and 
chaotic dynamics in teams (Ramos-Villagrasa et al., 2012). These different research 
directions have witnessed improvements in methodology. 
2.3.2 Recent developments-epistemology and methodology 
Scholars acknowledge that the study of time in organizations adopts variance and 
process epistemologies (Van de Ven, 2007). Variance approaches reflect the relationship 
between dependent and independent variables while process epistemologies examine 
evolving phenomenon and events (Langley et al., 2013), such as work place socialization 

 
45 
 
(Solinger et al., 2013).Variance and process epistemologies address different questions. 
Researchers examining the antecedents and outcomes adopt a variance epistemology 
while investigators examining emergence, development and growth draw on process 
epistemologies (Van de Ven, 2007). The author argued that these epistemologies are in 
some way complementary because the research from a variance model has an underlying 
process explanation. 
Variance and process epistemologies have guided researchers to attend to time  using 
approaches such as Latent Growth Modeling, Growth Mixture Modeling and Latent Class 
Growth Modeling (Vandenberg & Lance, 2000; Bentein et al., 2005; Wang & Bodner, 
2007; Vandenberghe et al., 2010). Researchers have adopted experience sampling 
methodology to capture intraindividual change (Fisher & To, 2012) and used daily diary 
studies (Binnewies & Wörnlein, 2010; Claessens et al., 2010). Studies adopting single 
latent growth models have examined change in new comer socialization (Vandenberg & 
Lance, 2000) and proactivity (Chan & Schmitt, 2000). Others have studied dynamic 
relationships using multivariate latent growth models to study changes in: turnover and 
commitment (Bentein et al., 2005), changes to supervisor support and socialization after 
organizational entry (Jokisaari & Nurmi, 2009), dynamic mediators of individual and 
team performance (Pitariu & Ployhart, 2009) and relationships between role stressors, job 
attitudes, turnover intentions and well-being  (Vandenberghe et al., 2010).   
Latent growth models (LGM) assume that all individuals come from the same 
population and share the same population parametres- slopes, intercepts and error 
variances (Wang & Bodner, 2007). A population may have latent groupings and 
membership of a latent class impacts the shape of a growth trajectory. With the assistance 
of Growth Mixture Modeling, Qureshi and Fang, (2011) found that socialization 
trajectories among members of an open software development group were associated with 

 
46 
 
different periods of time taken to achieve core developer status. Scholars have also 
adopted survival analysis to examine time to events such employee turnover, and survival 
analysis reflects the expected speed and the probability of turnover (Kammeyer-Mueller 
et al., 2005). 
Emerging 
methodological 
improvements 
include 
intra-team 
longitudinal 
perspectives, which uses a bottom up approach to studying team process dynamics (Li & 
Roe, 2012). Dynamic processes are studied using intraindividual trajectories which 
describe team processes in terms of: change direction, change degree and change rate 
which are used to create an inventory of temporal dynamic patterns. Step two depicts 
temporal dynamics using trajectories, step three clusters trajectories and step four links 
antecedents and consequences to temporal dynamics. The authors developed this method 
in response to the criticism of methodological misfit arising from the study of dynamics 
using variables. These recent developments are compared and contrasted in Table 4 using 
variance and process approaches.

The ideal candidates to address this call for research are time related individual 
differences. Researchers know very little about long term continuity and change in time 
related individual differences such as time perspective. Typically, change and continuity 
are regarded as mutually exclusive and are inferred using a ‗chunk of time‘ inherent in a 
retest design. The purpose of the present study is to address continuity and change in the 
dispositional view of time perspective using the model developed by Zimbardo and Boyd 
(1999) by positioning time related individual differences within the debate on continuity 
and change. 
To summarize the section, recent developments incorporating time into 
organizational research is attending to new temporal constructs, dynamic features and 
advocating studies of long term stability and change. The various calls for time related 
research produced a diversified response which may be synthesized using variance and 
process approaches. Time has been treated as a variable which is used to describe the 
unfolding changes in other variables or time is treated as passage which highlights 
unfolding and perishing. 
2.4 CHAPTER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
To recap, chapter two outlined the different times and centred these times on the debate of 
continuity and change. Secondly, it outlined the different times and time concepts in 
organizations and developed the debate on continuity and change at different units of 
analysis using practice based views and clock time. Thirdly, continuity or change was shown 
to be inconsistent with developments in the individual differences literatures and discussion 
of continuity and change in the broader OMT literature. Finally, some new developments in 
time related research are in progress along multiple lines such as: new construct 

 
48 
 
development, dynamic relationships, temporal relationships and calls for the study of 
stability and change.  
Continuity and change as a temporal theme is firmly located within the temporal research 
agenda (Roe, 2008).The theme of continuity and change is also present in organizations at 
different levels of analysis. Discussions about continuity and change in organizations have 
moved from a view of either or to the recognition of their coexistence. The coexistence of 
continuity and change are depicted as tensions which occur in clock time between forces of 
inertia and forces of change e.g. punctuated model of group development or models of 
organizational change. These models suggest that the status quo is stability which is 
punctuated by periods of change. These tensions are also present in practice based 
explanations for continuity and change which arise from socially constructed meanings of 
time and are evident in temporal work.   
Thinking about continuity and change as coterminous has not yet reached time 
related individual differences. Time related individual differences are developed within the 
tradition of differential thinking which generalizes findings across individuals. Under 
differential thinking it appears in general that the presence of rank order consistency is 
generalized to the individual level of analysis. Personality development researchers have 
challenged this view and found that continuity and change can co-exist rather than being 
mutually exclusive.  
To conclude, the central theme of the chapter is continuity and change which has its 
roots in discussions on being and becoming. Being reflects the static while becoming 
invokes the dynamic. Traditionally, within the individual differences literature continuity 
and change are seen as mutually exclusive, however multilevel thinking about 
organizational change and team development shows that continuity and change can coexist. 
However, time related individual differences are out of sync with the wider acceptance of 

 
49 
 
continuity and change as co-existing in the broader OMT and individual differences 
literature.  
The study of long term continuity and change is important because they force 
researchers to update their extant knowledge (Roe, 2005). Continuity and change are 
inherently temporal and highlight the importance of a theory‘s validity interval or the period 
of time over which a theory‘s claims are valid (Zaheer et al., 1998). Time related individual 
difference researchers do not distinguish between continuity and change, at the group and 
individual level, and retain an inadequate understanding of these important temporal 
features. The study of continuity and change in time perspective is neglected and the present 
study attempts to address this oversight.

CHAPTER 3  
TIME PERSPECTIVE LITERATURE 
REVIEW 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The time perspective literature will be examined over two chapters. Chapter three 
provides a broad over view of its conceptualization, measurement and schools of thought. 
Chapter four specifically examines the dispositional view of time perspective developed 
by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). The chapter is divided into three sections which are shown 
in Figure 5. Section one overviews the conceptualization and measurement debate. 
Section two discusses the different schools of thought examining time perspective. 
Section three develops the dispositional view of time perspective espoused by Zimbardo 
and Boyd (1999). The chapter ends with a discussion and conclusion arguing that it is 
time to begin a discussion on the themes of continuity and change using the dispositional 
view of time perspective developed by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999).

Terminology  
Before discussing the conceptual and measurement challenges surrounding time 
perspective, the position adopted in the review is as follows. Current practice is to treat 
time perspective and time orientation synonymously and interchangeably (Zimbardo 
&Boyd, 1999; Luyckx et al., 2010; Ely & Mercurio, 2011; de Bilde et al., 2011; Peetsma 
& van der Veen, 2011), and this practice is followed. The definition adopted of time 
perspective is as follows, ―time perspective is defined as the often nonconscious process 
whereby the continual flows of personal and social experiences are assigned to temporal 

 
52 
 
categories, or time frames, that help to give order, coherence, and meaning to those 
events,‖ (Zimbardo & Boyd,1999, p.1271).There is some confusion about the terms 
continuity and stability. Rank order stability is taken to imply the absence of change, 
which may be misleading (Roberts et al., 2008). Given the lack of research examining 
long term stability and change in time perspective, the term continuity will be used 
instead. The term continuity will be used in place of stability except when referring to the 
temporal research agenda advanced by Roe (2008). 
3.1 CONCEPTUALIZATION AND MEASUREMENT  
Time perspective was considered as a time related individual difference in chapter 
one. The purpose of the section is to demonstrate that researchers are divided on how to 
conceptualize and measure time perspective.  
3.1.1 Conceptualization 
The field of time perspective is characterized by diversity in measurement and 
conceptualization, and the lack of collaboration between researchers to create consensus 
is evident (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Traditionally, the conceptualization debate centres 
on the use of different terms to imply the same construct such as time perception, time 
sense, time perspective, time orientation (Wallace, 1956) and time preference  
(Chisholm, 1999) and these differences have led to criticism of construct validity. 
Although the field suffers from confusion in nomenclature, terms have different 
interpretations. 
Time perception also refers to succession and duration and how we perceive change 
(Fraisse, 1963; Fraisse, 1984) rather than to an orientation to time. Time preference 
indicates an individual‘s choice of a reward now or at some point in the future. Time 
orientation reflects an orientation toward past, present and future but is used 

 
53 
 
interchangeably with a broader construct of time perspective. 
Time perspective can be defined as ―the totality of the individuals views of his 
psychological future and his psychological past existing at a given time‖(Lewin, 1951, p. 
75). It is described as a cognitive filter that parses or partitions human experience into 
temporal categories of past, present and future (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Drake et al., 
2008; Holman & Zimbardo, 2009) or it refers to ―the composite cognitive structures that 
characterize the way the individual projects, collects, assesses, values and organizes 
events that reside in a distinct temporal foci.‖(Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005, p. 12).  
It is also considered as a ―cognitive-motivational concept that refers to thoughts and 
attitudes toward the past, present and future‖(Mello et al., 2009, p.539). It is regarded as a 
higher level construct demonstrating different dimensions such as extension, density and 
realism (Greene & De Backer, 2004), valance, accessibility, content (Nurmi 1989; Nurmi 
2005), structure and organisation (Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005), opportunities and focus on 
limitations (Cate & John, 2007), time orientation (De Volder, 1979), balance (Boniwell, 
2009) and it may be regarded as a global or domain specific construct (Peetsma et al., 
2005).  
Extension describes the time span in which one makes plans (Husman & Lens, 1999) 
and a person can extend into the future and past. Valence describes the subjective 
evaluation by the individual of a life domain (Peetsma & van der Veen, 2011). Density 
refers to the volume of thoughts and a feeling a person has in relation to a specific time 
zone of past, present and future, such as having a nostalgic or pessimistic view of the past. 
Accessibility describes the ease with which a person can recall and use information taken 
from different regions of time. Content shows the medium through which we access the 
past, such as memory and demonstrates how individuals connect past, present and future. 
Some individuals may not see that their present is a result of their past action or inaction 

 
54 
 
while others use goal setting to shape their future.   
Time perspective is also defined as a general orientation toward, and or, 
preoccupation with the past, present or future (Husman & Lens, 1999; Bartel &Milliken, 
2004; Ballard & Seibold, 2004b; Worrell & Mello, 2007; Luyckx et al., 2010; Fieulaine & 
Martinez, 2010; Dunkel & Weber, 2010) or as an ability to plan and organize events 
beyond the present (Seijts, 1998), or as a reflection on the past and anticipation of the 
future (Lennings & Burns, 1998). The differing conceptualizations of time perspective 
have led to the development of projective techniques and direct measures. 
3.1.2 Measurement-projective techniques  
The thematic apperception test (TAT) (Murray 1938, cited in Lasane & O'Donnell, 
2005, p.16), the incomplete thoughts test (ITT) (Ruiz & Krauss, 1968) and the story 
completion test (SCT) (Kandel et al., 1981) are described as projective techniques. To 
assess time orientation, TAT subjects are presented with five cards and asked to tell a 
story about the picture on the card. The stories are classified according to the percentage 
of references made to the past, present and future. In the incomplete thoughts test, a 
respondent completes sentences and the frequencies of future and present tenses included 
in the sentences are used as an index to classify individuals into past, present and future. 
The story completion test requires subjects to complete a story once they are given a root 
sentence and respondents are classified into past, present and future.  
In Cottle‘s (1968) experiential inventory, individuals disclose the top 10 most 
important life experiences and these are classified into past, present and future. The total 
number of experiences is allotted to each time zone and the one with the most allotted 
experiences is indicative of one‘s time orientation. The density scores are used to measure 
the level of involvement with past, present and future i.e. time orientation (De Volder, 
1979). In the time reference inventory (Roos & Albers, 1965), respondents are asked 

 
55 
 
questions and they choose a response of past, present, future and these responses are 
supposed to reflect the respondent‘s time orientation. The lines test (Cottle & Pleck, 1969) 
is used to categorize one‘s involvement with the past, present and future through the 
length of the lines drawn by the respondent. Projective techniques were criticized on the 
grounds of low reliability, scoring difficulties and on the basis that they measured 
different meanings of time perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999).  
3.1.3 Measurement-direct measures 
Surveys are also used to measure time orientation (Braely & Freed, 1971; Gjeseme, 
1975). The time reference inventory (Roos & Albers, 1965) presents individuals with 
positive, neutral and negative statements relating to past, present and future and asks 
respondents to record the age at which they believe the statement applies e.g. I believe the 
happiest time in my life was in the past, present, future. Individual scores are found by 
totalling the number of items selected and average years projected into the future. The 
measure is used to calculate temporal extension.  
Authors have developed inventories to directly measure time orientation which grew  
from efforts to link time orientation with motivation (Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005). 
Western cultures value achievement and place significant importance on the future as an 
arena for achievement. Early direct self-report measures include the Heimberg Future 
Time Perspective Inventory (Heimberg 1963, cited in Lessing, 1972). The measure 
consists of statements which were scored using a seven point likert scale and the scale 
score is indicative of the extent of a respondent‘s cognitive-motivational future time 
perspective. The inventory was shortened by Gjesme ( 1979) to create a four factor model 
of involvement, anticipation, occupation and speed.  
Other direct measures of time orientation include: the time structure questionnaire 
(Bond & Feather, 1988) organisational members‘ experience of time (Ballard & Seibold, 

 
56 
 
2004b) and time styles (Usunier & Valette-Florence, 1994) and the temporal satisfaction 
with life scale (Pavot et al., 1998), which rates the extent of positive attitudes to past, 
present and future. To address the shortcomings of projective techniques and 
unidimensionality of direct measures, a broader range of time orientation dimensions was 
developed by (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; and Jones et al. 2004). Zimbardo and Boyd 
(1999) developed a 56 item inventory to measure time perspective as a disposition and 
they demonstrated five time perspectives: past positive, past negative, present fatalism, 
present hedonism and future time perspective. The three component model of future 
orientation (Seginer, 2009) demonstrates a motivation, cognitive representation and 
behavioural dimensions to future time perspective. This model draws on the future 
orientation questionnaire which asks respondents about their hopes and fears for the 
future, work, career and domains of marriage and family.  
Recent developments in cognitive motivational schools using direct measures 
include the Adolescent Time Perspective Inventory-Time Attitudes (ATP-TA) (Worrell & 
Mello, 2009). This measure of time perspective is a state measure and it contains six time 
perspectives: future negative, future positive, present positive and negative, past positive 
and past negative. The inventory claims the following advantages over the ZTPI: higher 
reliabilities, stable factor structure using invariance testing between German and U.S. 
samples, satisfactory SEM fit indices and inclusion of positive and negative evaluation of 
the past, present and future (Worrell et al., 2011). The inventory demonstrated 
discriminant validity using GPA scores, school belonging, academic self-concept, future 
will work out, hope, perceived life chances, optimism, self-esteem and perceived stress. 
The inventory proposed by Worell and Mello (2009) was not considered because it is 
designed for adolescents aged between 12 and 19 years of age, is limited to educational 
settings, it is a state measure and does not have the set of relationships with relatively 

 
57 
 
broader outcomes relative to the ZTPI. 
To summarize, the first section of chapter three outlined the conceptual and 
measurement concerns relating to time perspective which were noted by Wallace (1955) 
DeVolder (1979) and Lassane and O‘Donnell (2005). The conceptual confusion has led to 
a pot pourri of measures. The main concern is that any comparison of studies about time 
perspective is erroneous because time perspective is measured differently and is 
conceptualized as an orientation toward past, present and future, temporal extension, and 
negative thoughts about the future, density, coherence and directionality.  
The difficulty with projective measures such as TAT, SCT and ITT and drawing tasks 
is that they are used to measure extension, they are scored subjectively, address the 
cognitive dimensions of time orientation, but do not address the affective and behavioural 
dimensions (Lasane & O'Donnell, 2005) and they have been criticized on the ground of 
reliability and validity (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). Direct measures have been criticized on 
the grounds that they are unidimensional, (Seijts, 1998), they are regarded as bipolar 
constructs (Daltrey & Langer, 1984) and over emphasize the future at the expense of the 
present and past (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999).   
The different conceptualizations and measures of time perspective have been shaped 
by the diverse community of researchers who focus on different aspects of time 
perspective. The discussion on the schools of thought and conceptualization and 
measurement are used to (1) place boundaries on time perspective literature and (2) to 
locate time perspective in the continuity and change debate using the conceptualization 
and measurement of time perspective proposed by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). 

 
58 
 
3.2 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT 
The aim of section two of chapter three is to show that there are different schools of 
thought examining time perspective in diverse ways. 
The study of time perspective can be classified into different schools of thought such as 
identity based, cognitive perspectives, developmental approaches and dispositional views 
which adopt different interpretations of time perspective. A school of thought is defined as 
―small groups of mature scientists pursuing a reasonably coherent program of research 
side–by side with advanced students in the same institutional context and engaging in 
direct, continuous social and intellectual interaction, (Geison 1981, cited in Olesko, 1993, 
p.17). Schools of thought may be described as a theoretical framework that is associated 
with an active empirical research stream (McKinley et al., 1999). 
3.2.1 Schools of thought-Cognitive Social Theory 
The cognitive motivational school suggest that time perspective is conceptualized as 
a cognitive motivational concept linked with proximal and distal goals. The perspective 
focuses predominantly on the future and exploits the future-present link. Time perspective 
is operationalized as a distance or extension into the future. One‘s ability to perceive an 
instrumental relationship between long term goals and sub goals is essential to 
maintaining achievement motivation. The application of this perspective is in educational 
settings (De Volder & Lens, 1982; Husman & Lens, 1999; Simons et al., 2004; Lens, 
2006; Lens et al., 2012). The perspective also encompasses self-regulation, cognitive, 
affective and behavioural approaches to time perspective (Seginer, 2009; Peetsma & van 
der Veen, 2011). Bandura (1991) suggests that we create cognitive representations of the 
future in our present and activities are converted to current motivators and regulators of 
behaviour. Individuals self-regulate within the context of goal setting and achievement, 

 
59 
 
and goal theory is consistent with cognitive social theory (Locke & Latham, 2002). In 
social cognitive theory, future time perspective refers the ―degree to which and the way in 
which the chronological future is integrated in to the present life-space of an individual  
through motivational goal setting,‖ (Husman & Lens, 1999: 114). Goals are a motivating 
factor in achievement, however, individuals can also be motivated to construct a future 
identity through identity based motivation (Oyserman & Destin, 2010).  
3.2.2 Schools of thought-Identity based approaches 
Identity based approaches to time perspective draw on the past and future as 
motivators to construct viable identities and avoid undesired identities. More generally, 
identity is ―described as a complex system of self-definition, shaped within a social 
context that provides interpretation for life experiences and helps to guide life choices‖  
(Erikson 1968, cited in Kerpelman et al., 2008, p.151) 
When making decisions about what one would like to be, individuals explore and 
commit to an identity. The exploration and commitment to an identity is related to future, 
past and present time perspectives. Identity achievement reflects a commitment to an 
identity after a period of exploration. In Lukyxx and Lens (2010), time perspective and 
identity status demonstrated a reciprocal relationship. In a recent study (Laghi et al., 
2013) examining the relationship between time perspective and identity status, the authors 
found that future time perspective and past positive were positively associated with an 
integrated identity status while a diffused status was correlated with present fatalism and 
lower future time perspective. 
The second way in which identity literature informs time perspective literature is 
through identity based interventions which help to promote identity development 
(Schwartz, 2001). Identity based interventions such as possible selves are regarded as a 
mechanism for identity exploration and formation (Dunkel, 2000; Dunkel & Anthis, 

 
60 
 
2001). Scholars examining possible selves adopt a future time perspective to study 
individual hopes, fears and expectations relating to the future (Markus & Nurius, 1986; 
Oyserman et al., 2002; Oyserman et al., 2004; Oyserman and Fryberg, 2006; Oyserman, 
2008; Lee & Oyserman, 2009a; Lee & Oyserman, 2009b; Oyserman & James, 2009; 
Oyserman et al., 2010; Destin & Oyserman, 2010). The possible self is expressed in the 
context of the ideal self toward which an individual strives, the real self-reflecting the 
potential to become, and the feared self is defined by the fears of becoming. 
3.2.3 Schools of thought-Lifespan Development  
Time perspective demonstrates plasticity in socioemotional selectivity theory 
through an expansive or contracting time perspective. Socioemotional selectivity theory 
(Carstensen et al., 1999) postulates that an individual‘s age related appraisal of time as 
expansive or contracting or their time perspective motivates them to choose between 
emotional or knowledge based goals (Lang & Carstensen, 2002). The theory is applied to 
the life span and shows that as people get older they perceive their futures as contracting, 
and choose social goals over knowledge-based goals. The perception that there is a 
limited time remaining acts as a motivator to pursue socially meaningful objectives rather 
than engaging in goal directed behaviour aimed at knowledge acquisition. Social goals 
focus on finding meaning in one‘s life, expanding one‘s social network and establishing 
―feelings of social embeddedness,‖ (Carstensen et al., 1999, p.166).  
Socioemotional selectivity theory also plays a role in the composition of personal 
networks when time is perceived as limited. When individuals perceive their future as 
restricted, they choose personal networks that can satisfy social and emotional goals while 
instrumental and knowledge based goals influence the choice of personal networks when 
time is appraised as expansive (Lang & Carstensen, 2002). Time perspective is viewed as 
an adaptable mechanism that is open to the influence of contextual factors (Löckenhoff & 

 
61 
 
Carstensen, 2004). 
3.2.4 Schools of thought-Developmental Perspective 
Developmental perspectives are more complex. Two strands of literature are linked 
to time perspective. The first literature examines how children adapt to the many facets of 
time such as learning about past, present and future, unidirectionality of time, recognition 
of temporal patterns and the development of temporal memory. The second area of 
research examines the content of future hopes, dreams and fears, which influences the 
formulation and achievement of future goals and decisions about life domains such as 
career, marriage and family (Seginer, 2009). The hopes and fears literature is more 
relevant to future time perspective. Future orientation is inherently connected with an 
individual‘s development (Nurmi, 2005) because we create our future through anticipation 
and goals, and we make plans to realize them. Children gradually learn about past, present 
and future through language development and conversations with mothers (Harner, 1981; 
Hudson, 2002), through socialization in school, through development of episodic memory 
and learning about time‘s arrow (Friedman, 2002; Friedman, 2003). Future time 
perspective develops from about 11 years onwards and prior to this age is entwined with 
fantasy (Peetsma, 2010).  
The second context includes hopes and fears. Friedman (2008) argues that it is not 
until about 15 years of age that adolescents use imagery to represent time of the day, days 
of the week and months of the year. Developmental psychologists working with children 
and adolescents focus on the content of time perspective such as future hopes, dreams and 
fears and the content of time perspective can change as a function of the lifespan. 
Children‘s hopes and dreams are different from those of adolescents. Children‘s hopes and 
dreams for the future may focus on becoming an astronaut or racing car driver, while 
those of adolescents may be more realistic and defined in terms of career, marriage and 

 
62 
 
family (Nurmi 1989; Seginer & Halabi-Kheir, 1998; Seginer & Lilach, 2004; Seginer & 
Mahajna, 2004; Nurmi 2005; Seginer, 2008; Peetsma & van der Veen, 2011). 
Adolescent time perspective research is largely future orientated. Adolescence is an 
important time for studying the development of time perspective because individuals 
acquire advanced cognitive abilities that permit them to consider the hypothetical 
(Keating 1990, cited in Mello et al., 2009).  
The envisioning of a future is accompanied by hopes and fears which change as a 
function of the lifespan (Nurmi, 2005). At the age of 11, children contemplate future 
oriented topics such as career, marriage and family. The content of future time perspective 
in middle adulthood is defined around family and property related goals (Nurmi, 2005). 
He also argues that, as we age, the content of the future is defined in terms of health, 
leisure, lifestyle and religious topics. Developmentalists look at the changing content of 
future time perspective, but other researchers tend to focus more on time perspective as a 
disposition. 
3.3 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT-DISPOSITIONAL VIEW  
The objective of section three of the chapter is to provide an introduction to the work 
of Zimbardo and Boyd (1999), who made a significant contribution to the time 
perspective literature by developing a valid and reliable measure. 
3.3.1 Description 
The dispositional approach to time perspective is regarded as context free and 
researchers in this stream regard time perspective as a stable individual difference or 
disposition (McGrath & Tschan, 2004; Seginer, 2009; Gupta et al., 2012). This 
perspective is central to the study because it fits within the theme of continuity and 
change. The dispositional approach to time perspective involves, thinking, appraisal and 

 
63 
 
action (Seginer, 2009). The thinking element is represented by the extent to which 
individuals weigh the future consequences of present actions (Strathman et al., 1994). 
Appraisal describes the extent to which individuals act to surmount obstacles blocking 
their pathway (Snyder et al., 1991) while action addresses planning, goal setting, and 
deadlines (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). Zimbardo and Boyd (1999), through a series of 
iterations, developed what is currently known as the Zimbardo Time Perspective Index or 
ZTPI. 
3.3.2 Zimbardo and Boyd Time Perspective Index- overview  
The Zimbardo Time Perspective Index, (ZTPI) originated with a study in Psychology 
Today which indicated a seven factor structure in Time Perspective (Gonzalez & 
Zimbardo, 1985). Using a 30 item survey, the authors found the following factors: (1) 
future, work motivation–perseverance, (2) present fatalistic, worry free, avoid planning, 
(3) present hedonistic, (4) future, goal seeking and planning, (5) time press, (6) future, 
pragmatic action for later gain and (7) future, specific, daily planning. 
The Stanford Time Perspective Index (STPI), developed from Gonzalez and Zimbardo 
was referred to as a measure of time orientation (Lennings, 2000). The (STPI) contained 
38 items across four scales (1) present hedonism (2) present fatalism (3) future and (4) 
past regret. Through scale revisions, the Stanford Time perspective Inventory expanded to 
a 56 item scale (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and was renamed the Zimbardo Time 
Perspective Index. 
The Zimbardo and Boyd Time Perspective Index was developed to measure time 
perspective in a valid and reliable way. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) identified five time 
perspectives: future, present hedonism, present fatalism, past negative and past positive.  
The future time perspective is the most studied of all of the time perspectives (Boniwell, 
2009).  

 
64 
 
Future oriented individuals, according to Zimbardo and Boyd (2008) tend to: obtain 
regular health and dental check-ups, be weight conscious, refrain from drinking, smoking 
and drug taking, have pensions and medical insurance, are depressed less and less likely 
to ruminate over past events, report higher levels of support from extended networks, take 
less risks, achieve higher grades, make more money, achieve higher education levels, 
make the best of difficult situations and focus on long term rather than short term gains.   
Present hedonists tend to: live in the moment, crave excitement, take risks, and 
disregard the future consequences of present actions, develop addiction to drugs, and 
practice unsafe sex. They tend to be more aggressive, depressed, have more energy, and 
are less likely to wear a wrist watch. Present fatalists tend to believe they have little 
control over events and tend to be more: shy, anxious, lie more and have low self-esteem. 
Past positive represents a nostalgic view of the past and is associated with 
friendliness, well-being, and low levels of depression, anxiousness and aggression. Past 
negative represents an aversive view of the past and is positively associated with 
gambling, lying and stealing.  
Validation studies indicate that the factor structure replicates across different cultures 
and that research effort stresses construct, criterion and discriminant validity (Zimbardo & 
Boyd, 1999; Apostolidis & Fieulaine, 2004; Milfont and Gouveia, 2006; Worrell & Mello, 
2007; Milfont et al., 2008; Liniauskaité·& Kairys, 2009; Shipp et al., 2009; Carelli & 
Wiberg, 2011). The 56 item scale has been translated into different languages and 
validated in various countries and it continues to be the most valid and reliable way of 
assessing individual time perspectives (Wakefield et al., 2010). Researchers have 
attempted to shorten the scale which resulted in poor psychometric properties (D'Alessio 
et al., 2003; Wakefield et al., 2010).  

 
65 
 
3.4 CHAPTER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Time perspective is examined from a: cognitive social theory, identity, life span, 
development psychology and dispositional perspectives. Time perspective, depending on 
the school of thought, is argued to be malleable or is considered to be a stable individual 
difference which predicts many outcomes. Time perspective is open to the influence of 
context using hopes and fears (Nurmi 2005; Seginer, 2008; Seginer, 2009), is adaptable in 
old age (Carstensen et al., 1999),provides a means of exploring and committing to identity 
through possible selves (Luyckx et al., 2010; Cadely et al., 2011) and is central to self-
regulation and motivation to achieve distal outcomes through a goal hierarchy.  
The different schools of thought use different ways of measuring time perspective, 
but they emphasise different aspects such as the content of future time perspective or the 
orientation aspect. Early measurement approaches such as projective techniques were 
criticised on the grounds of unreliability and construct validity. These approaches to 
measurement adopted different understandings of time perspective leading to inconsistent 
research findings.  
The dispositional measure of time perspective was developed by Zimbardo and Boyd 
(1999) where time perspective is considered as an orientation to past present and future 
and it has proved popular because of its psychometric properties and its replicated factor 
structure. The measure provides a valid and reliable way to measure time perspectives and 
measures all three temporal categories. Despite the growth of time perspective, the entire 
field appears divided on philosophical, conceptual and measurement grounds. 
Seginer (2009) characterized time orientation into thematic and athematic 
approaches. Athematic approaches reflect a generalized aptitude to think about temporal 
categories such as the future irrespective of context and these are considered as a 

 
66 
 
personality. Thematic perspective addresses the role of events and experiences relating to 
the future i.e. future content. The theme of continuity and change is implicit in the 
thematic and athematic approaches. Athematic approaches, such as the dispositional view 
of time perspective, reflects stability in how one orients to the future, past and present.  
This view has its roots in substance philosophy which suggests scientific laws are 
grounded in substance because it is unchanging.  Substance denies change because it is 
unreal, but our experience unfolds from present to future and this experience has content 
such as hopes and fears and this content changes across the lifespan and in different 
domains of life. Changing future content echoes a process philosophy because as 
individuals age they move through different stages of life. 
Time perspective has been conceptualized and measured differently which might be 
attributed to philosophical underpinnings. Life span development and development 
psychologists conceptualize time perspective as changing with life stages. Socioemotional 
selectivity theory shows that individuals can expand or contract their time perspectives in 
response to endings. Developmental approaches examine the content of future time 
perspective using hopes and fears, which unfold and perish with life stages. Implicitly 
these schools adopt a process approach to time perspective by their emphasis on life 
stages which shows changing content of future time perspective. Their focus is on events 
and how hopes and fears unfold. Cognitive and dispositional approaches adopt substance 
philosophies which emphasize fixed attributes of entities and variables. Currently, time 
perspectives are regarded as stable which reflects a short coming of the dispositional view 
of time perspective in that there is no defined boundary for change, and it is time to define 
that boundary.  
To conclude the chapter, clearly there is no definitive view on conceptualizing and 
measuring time perspective. The schools of thought reviewed were cognitive 

 
67 
 
motivational, identity, life span, developmental and dispositional perspectives which 
attend to different aspects of time perspective such as extension (Simons et al., 2004) and 
content (Seginer & Halabi-Kheir, 1998; Seginer and Mahajna, 2004). The focus of 
attention is the model of time perspective espoused by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). The 
model addresses the criticisms of reliability and validity raised and it represents a more 
balanced approach to time perspective in that past, present and future are considered. The 
scale has been validated in many cultures and demonstrates construct, criterion and 
discriminant validity and researchers have identified antecedents and outcomes.

CHAPTER 4 
ANTECEDENTS AND OUTCOMES OF 
TIME PERSPECTIVE 
INTRODUCTION 
  
The central theme of interest is continuity and change in the dispositional view of 
time perspective. The aim of chapter four is to present the antecedents and outcomes of 
the five time perspectives identified by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) to show that 
continuity and change are significantly under researched, which has implications for 
theory development. The chapter contains three sections. Section one overviews the 
literature to highlight areas of growth using the dispositional view of time perspective and 
it suggests that there is a strong commitment to creating consensus about the validity of 
the five time perspectives. Section two presents a discussion of the antecedents of time 
perspective and section three presents literature on the outcomes. The chapter follows the 
layout presented in Figure 6.

4.1 TIMELESS RESEARCH  
The objective of section one of the chapter is to highlight that time perspective 
research is largely timeless and there is a continued commitment to validating the 
measure. 
The literature using time perspective as a disposition has grown gradually since 1999 
and output is diverse. The range of applications is evident in Figure 7. The most popular 
avenues are validation studies, substance abuse, health and academic arenas. Research has 
largely expanded using correlation and regression analysis. Research output has focused 
on growing time perspective‘s nomological network by relating it to other constructs. In 
his review of time in applied psychology, Roe (2008) classifies studies according to the 
sensitivity of their design to time. There are four classifications: (a) timeless (b) 
methodologically temporal, (c) conceptually temporal and (d) fully temporal. Timeless 
research is typified by cross sectional designs. Methodologically temporal research 
specifies the measurement occasions; usually a pre and post-test design, conceptually 
temporal designs consider various time concepts such as sequence and rhythms and fully 
temporal designs examine change over time, have multiple measurement occasions and 
emphasize dynamic features such as onset, duration and offset.  
In the context of the current temporal research agenda, time perspective is largely 
timeless despite the opportunity to place it in at least a methodological category using the 
research on the balanced time perspective (BTP), which reflects an ability to switch 
between time perspectives depending on the prevailing circumstances. While the focus 
has been on examining the antecedents and outcomes of time perspective, there is a small 
literature on changing time perspectives which draws on the balanced time perspective. 

 
71 
 
4.1.1 Changing time perspective 
The balanced time perspective BTP refers to one‘s ability to switch between different 
time perspectives depending on the situational demands (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; 
Zimbardo & Boniwell, 2004). Drake et al. (2008) indicated that respondents with a 
balanced time perspective showed higher average scores on the subjective happiness scale 
and the mindfulness scale relative to those with an unbalanced time perspective. 
A balanced time perspective requires low scores on present fatalism and past negative and 
moderate to high scores on present hedonism and future time perspective. Boniwell et al. 
(2010) found that the BTP was positively related to higher life satisfaction higher positive 
effect, higher scores on actualization and time competence scale. The BTP is useful for 
monitoring time perspectives such as past negative and present fatalism because no good 
can come of these time perspectives (Zimbardo & Boyd 2008).The optimal score for 
future time perspective is 3.69, present hedonism 4.33, present fatalism 1.67, past positive 
3.67 and past negative 2.1 (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). 
The balancing of time perspectives implies that they demonstrate change. Research 
in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder showed that past negative, and present 
fatalism perspectives were lowered to minimal levels while future time perspective and 
past positive time perspectives were increased Sword et al., (2009), Zimbardo et al., 
(2012) and Sword et al.,( 2013). Temporal therapy is a clinical intervention that seeks to 
achieve a balanced time perspective among those suffering from post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD).  

 
72 
 
 
Figure 7 Summary of publications using the ZTPI from 1997-2013 
 

 
73 
 
The objective of this therapy is to reduce past negative and present fatalism and to 
increase future, past positive and present hedonism through reframing the events and 
experience that produced the PSTD (Zimbardo et al., 2012). Currently, the central focus  
on the BTP is how to calculate it rather than viewing the BTP as an opportunity to put 
time into time perspective. Clearly, researchers are not grasping this chance to investigate 
dynamic features such as the unfolding of changes in time perspectives as a result of 
temporal therapy. 
4.1.2 Positioning the field 
The diverse array of publications using the ZTPI is evidence of continuity, in  that 
paradigmatic assumptions underpinning the dispositional view of time perspective may be 
described as maintaining a ―consensus about the validity status of theory‖(Mc Kinley, 
2010, p.52). Continuity refers to the maintenance of linkages with intellectual frameworks 
that are recognized by researchers and the price of continuity is the cost of novel 
theoretical contributions (McKinley et al., 1999). McKinley (2010) argued that theory 
development in organizations is shifting away from consensus about validity toward 
theory development for its own sake.  
He describes this shift in terms of movement away from replication and instrument 
standardization toward the development of theory as an end in itself. His comments have 
implications for time perspective research. For time perspective, the consensus 
emphasizes replication, instrumental and definitional standardization and new theory 
development reflects theory testing to create consensus about the validity or invalidity of 
theory. The most popular lines of research using the ZTPI include validation (replication) 
arising from cross cultural comparisons using the ZTPI. The validity of the measure is 
examined (instrument and definitional standardization) and new theory development 
occurs when a new antecedent, outcome, mediator or moderator is found which creates 

 
74 
 
consensus that the dispositional view of time perspective is valid. 
To summarize, the dispositional view of time perspective is situated within the 
current temporal research agenda, but it is silent on continuity and change. The growth in 
the literature since 1999 has occurred to bolster the consensus about the validity of the 
measure. This approach explains why time perspective research is timeless; the focus is 
not about time it is about creating consensus that time perspective is a stable individual 
difference. This consensus has been created through replication, new theory development 
and instrumental and definitional standardization. 
4.2 ANTECEDENTS OF TIME PERSPECTIVE 
Section two of the chapter presents the antecedents of time perspective. The 
antecedents are organized in a multilevel structure to show that time perspectives are 
shaped by macro and micro level factors such as culture, demographics, family and 
individual level factors. Figure 8  shows the nomological network with antecedents of 
time perspectives on the left and the outcomes on the right. The balanced time perspective 
and temporal therapy are shown in the centre because they deal with time perspective 
itself.   
4.2.1 Antecedents - culture 
Antecedents of time perspectives and differences in time perspectives are a function 
of national culture, social institutions, gender and location. Time perspective has also been 
applied to team settings (Waller et al., 2001; Bartel & Milliken, 2004) and teams work 
across different cultural environments and demonstrate time perspective heterogeneity 
(Gibson et al., 2008). The authors propose some antecedents of heterogeneity and 
homogeneity of time perspective such as national culture, firm level global integration 
and environmental volatility. Global teams may contain individuals from a variety of 

 
75 
 
different nationalities, backgrounds and cultures. Work by (Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck, 
1961) showed that five US subcultures differed in their orientation toward past, present 
and future. Antecedents of future time perspective include: living in a temperate zone, 
being part of a stable family and society, religion, education, stage of life, having a job, 
technology, being successful, and having future oriented role models (Zimbardo & Boyd, 
2008). Individuals who live in more temperate climate, such as that prevailing at the 
equator, see little variation in their day and tend to adopt a present time perspective 
(Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). We are born as present-oriented infants and through 
socialization we learn future time perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). 
The demographic antecedents include: religion, culture and education, age and gender  
 4.2.1.1. Religion 
Other antecedents to time perspective include religion. The protestant work ethic has 
been cited as an antecedent to future time perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008) on the 
grounds that materially successful individuals were predestined to enter an afterlife. 
Research conducted by Mudrack ( 1997) suggests that the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) is 
a personality variable which has more to do with a work ethic rather than a religion. In 
Mudrack‘s study, the PWE is considered as a multidimensional construct consisting of 
hard work, asceticism, negative views arising from the absence of hard work, and anti-
leisure. The results of the study showed that hard work dimension significantly correlated 
with the future and present dimensions of the time structure questionnaire (Bond and 
Feather, 1988) and, according to Zimbardo (2010), protestants are more future oriented 
than Catholics.

4.2.1.2 Education 
Education is an antecedent to future time perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). 
Studies examining the relationship between education and time perspectives range from 
academically talented adolescents (Worrell & Mello, 2007) to university students 
(Zimbardo et al., 1997; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Keough et al., 1999; Harber et al., 2003; 
Boyd & Zimbardo, 2005). The results of these studies show that education as indicated by 
grade point average is positively correlated with future time perspective and past positive 
time perspectives and negatively correlated with present hedonism, past negative and 
present fatalism. University students showed that hours spent preparing, academic 
application and academic orientation were negatively correlated with present fatalism, 
past negative, present hedonism and past negative (Horstmanshof & Zimitat, 2007). The 
authors found that future ime perspective is a correlate of academic achievement and 
positively correlated with hours spent preparing, academic application and academic 
orientation. 
Studies examining the relationship between time perspective and education tend to 
use education as an outcome variable. Time perspective is also linked with occupation and 
years spent in education (Guthrie et al., 2009). In this study individuals of varying socio 
economic status showed that those who were in professional occupations and who had 
more formal education scored higher on future time perspective and obtained lower scores 
on present fatalism relative to those with less formal educations and non –professional 
jobs. 
4.2.1.3 Age and Gender 
Age and gender are both correlates and predictors of time perspective. The 
relationships between time perspective and age is ambiguous (Mello & Worrell, 2006; 

 
78 
 
Milfont et al., 2008). Studies report a positive relationship between future time 
perspective and age (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Hamilton et al., 2003; Holman & Silver, 
2005; Mello & Worrell, 2006; Corral-Verdugo, 2006; Ferrari & Díaz-Morales, 2007), a 
negative relationship between age and present hedonism (Apostolidis et al., 2006a; 
Dunkel & Weber, 2010) and no relationship between age and time perspectives (Préau et 
al., 2007; Milfont et al., 2008). 
Research examining the relationship between gender and time perspective appears 
inconclusive. Females score higher relative to males on past positive and future time 
perspectives (Zimbardo & Boyd 1999), while no gender differences in time perspectives 
were reported by Corral-Verdugo (2006) and Dunkel and Weber (2010). In a validation 
study using a Lithuanian sample (Liniauskaité & Kairys, 2009) found that males scored 
higher relative to females on across all five time perspectives. 
4.2.2 Antecedents-life trajectories and life events  
The role of context as a predictor of time perspective is examined in life history 
trajectories. ―Life history theory is a mid-level theory derived from evolution‖ (Dunkel & 
Weber, 2010, p.96). Life history theory asserts that individuals will differ in life history 
strategies aimed at growth, parenting and reproduction (Belsky et al., 1991). Individuals 
may follow one of two types of trajectories, which describe the trade-offs between having 
many offspring and parental investment. Type one trajectories describe fast growth, many 
offspring and reduced parental investment and are characterized by: familial 
circumstances that emphasize relationships as self-serving, promote untrustworthiness, 
resource scarcity and environmental uncertainty.  
Life history strategies adopted by individuals in these circumstances focus on the 
short term (Belsky et al., 1991) and such individuals will focus on their own growth and 
reproduction rather than on parenting. Type two trajectories involve gradual growth with 

 
79 
 
fewer offspring and higher levels of parental investment and these are described in terms 
of familial circumstances that emphasize trustworthiness, relationships are regarded as 
having mutual benefit, resources are readily available and environmental circumstances 
are relatively more stable (Belsky et al., 1991) and there is a focus on the long term. 
Individuals following type two trajectories tend to emphasize parental investment rather 
than growth and reproduction. Life history strategies positively predicted future time 
perspective and present hedonism while negatively predicting the past negative time 
perspective (Dunkel & Weber, 2010). 
Living in a stable family environment supports the development of a future time 
perspective (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Social development environments that were 
characterized by violence, proclivity for harassment and being victims of theft predicted 
present hedonism or a time perspective that emphasized the here and now (Kruger et al., 
2008). Positive socio-developmental environments that: demonstrate help toward others, 
are safe, emphasize positive socialization and perceptions of friendly neighbours, 
positively predicted future time perspective and negatively predicted a present orientation. 
Present hedonism was also predicted by aggression, while the availability of 
resources predicted future time perspective. Other researchers (Fieulaine & Apostolidis, 
2007) studied the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and time perspective 
and found that deprivation positively predicted past negative time perspective and 
negatively predicted past positive time perspective. Life trajectory theory also addresses 
attachment and its relationship with time perspective (Kruger & Fisher, 2008). Life 
history represents a context that shapes time perspectives, and life contexts such as 
serious illness can also predict time perspectives. 
4.2.3 Antecedents-serious illness 
Antecedents of time perspective can also be found in the context of life events such 

 
80 
 
as serious illness. In a study on traumatic reactions to chronic illness and disability arising 
from diabetes, sufferers found that denial, acknowledgement and adjustment predicted 
future time perspective (Martz & Livneh, 2007). Denial about the illness negatively 
predicted future time perspective in that the more sufferers were in denial; the less they 
focused on the future. Denial appears to form a protective block against exposing oneself 
to a perceived negative future filled with difficulties associated with the illness. 
Acknowledgement and adjustment were positive predictors of future time perspective in 
that they facilitated the future acceptance of the difficulties posed by diabetes. Life 
trajectories examine the impact of family settings which also raise issues of attachment 
and identity as time perspective antecedents.   
4.2.4 Antecedents-attachment and identity development  
Time perspective is also predicted by attachment relations (Belsky et al., 1991). 
Research conducted by Laghi et al. (2008) demonstrated that adolescents with low 
parental attachment predicted past negative time perspective while high parental 
attachment predicted past positive, present hedonism and future time perspectives. 
Research evidence suggests that attachment to parents and peers (Laghi et al., 2008), life 
history events, identity commitment and personality (Dunkel & Weber, 2010), the social 
development environment (Kruger et al., 2008) are predictors of time perspectives.  
Attachment is related to identity development (Samuolis et al., 2001). Identity 
commitment positively predicted future time perspective and negatively predicted present 
hedonism and present fatalism (Luyckx et al., 2010). Identity styles also predicted 
different time perspectives. The information style positively predicted future time 
perspective and the diffuse avoidant style positively predicted present fatalism. Research 
relating the identity status model Marcia‘s (1966) with time perspective demonstrated that 
an achieved identity status reflected higher past positive and future time perspectives 

 
81 
 
relative to moratorium, foreclosure and diffusion statuses. The diffusion status reflected 
higher present hedonism, past negative and present fatalist time perspectives (Laghi et al., 
2013). Building and committing to an identity involves thinking about the past and future, 
and such thinking is related to our time perspectives. While antecedents of time 
perspective are shaped by cultural, demographic and familial factors, there are individual 
level antecedents such as mind theory and personality. 
4.2.5 Antecedents-mind theory 
Individuals, through mental time travel (Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997) can use the 
present to plan for future events by drawing on past experience. Through evolution, 
human beings learned to mental time travel by (a) creating symbolic representations of 
reality (b) placing these symbolic representations into different locations and (c) creating 
relationships between these symbolic representations (Fortunato and Furey, 2010). These 
developments are reflected in the extent to which we think about the present, future and 
past (Fortunato & Furey, 2011).  
Thinking about past, present and future has a relationship with time perspective 
(Fortunato & Furey, 2010). These researchers found that future time perspective and 
present hedonism were positively predicted by present thinking. Past positive time 
perspective was positively predicted by present and future thinking while past negative 
was positively predicted by past thinking and present fatalism was negatively predicted by 
present thinking and positively predicted by past thinking.  
4.2.6 Antecedents-personality 
Studies using the ZTPI show that it correlates significantly with many other 
psychological constructs. High correlations between time perspective and other constructs 
raise concerns about discriminant validity. In a validation study conducted by Zimbardo 

 
82 
 
and Boyd (1999) the authors tested the discriminant validity between conscientiousness 
and future time perspective, and they found evidence to support the discriminant validity 
of future time perspective. Conscientiousness and neuroticism were statistically 
significant predictors of future time perspective. Neuroticism, Extraversion and 
Conscientiousness predicted present fatalism and, present hedonism was significantly 
predicted by openness, extraversion and conscientiousness and agreeableness. Past 
negative was predicted by neuroticism and extraversion (Dunkel & Weber, 2010).  
To summarize section two of the chapter, time perspective is predicted and shaped 
by a set of multilevel interlocking factors ranging from culture, social, family 
demographic and individual level factors. Cultural values inform time perspective by 
emphasizing what values are important, which set the agenda for temporal socialization 
through the educations system. The familial setting shapes future and present time 
perspectives by creating or denying access to resources, and supporting or limiting 
attachment relations. Individual level factors such as personality and thinking about past, 
present and future have predictive value. However, the relationships between time 
perspectives, age and gender appears unclear. 
4.3 OUTCOMES OF TIME PERSPECTIVE  
  
The purpose of the section is to review literature on the outcomes predicted by time 
perspectives. 
4.3.1 Outcomes-physical health 
For the purposes of brevity, literature on substance abuse, gambling and addiction 
can be synthesised under physical and mental health. Across this literature, the general 
trend indicates that future time perspective is a positive predictor of physical and mental 
health outcomes (Daugherty & Brase, 2009). Time perspective influences decisions about 

 
83 
 
health because health issues tend to manifest themselves in the future (Daugherty & 
Brase, 2009) as a result of our present actions or inactions. Future time perspective 
positively predicted health protective behaviours such as taking exercise (Henson et al., 
2006). Future time perspective is instrumental in decisions to participate in diabetes 
screening (Crockett et al., 2009), taking up the flu vaccine (Fieulaine and Martinez, 
2009), protection against contracting HIV (Rothspan & Read, 1996; Aronowitz et al., 
2005) and it predicted social relations, psychological well-being and level of 
independence among HIV sufferers (Préau et al., 2007). 
The present and past time perspectives are also related to health. Research on the 
relationship between present hedonism and health related behaviour indicates that present 
hedonism is positively related to tobacco use and alcohol consumption and a larger 
number of unprotected sexual encounters (MacKillop et al., 2007; Daugherty & Brase, 
2009). Health research has incorporated past negative and present fatalism, and among 
HIV patients, present fatalism negatively predicted: quality of life (Préau et al., 2007), 
seat belt use, condom use and use of birth control (Henson et al., 2006) and positively 
predicted tobacco use and health concerns (Daugherty & Brase, 2009). HIV research has 
indicated that present fatalism is positively correlated with the number of life time sexual 
partners and the number of sexual partners over a six month period (Rothspan & Read, 
1996). A recent study of HIV sufferers in rural areas found that present hedonism was 
negatively related to the frequency of calling to a support service (Tucker et al., 2011). 
Time perspectives also predict mental health outcomes. 

 
84 
 
4.3.2 Outcomes- mental health 
The World Health Organization (2010) defines mental health as ― a state of well-
being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal 
stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her 
community.‖  
Researchers have investigated relationships between time perspective and a variety 
of mental health outcomes such as suicidal ideation (Laghi et al., 2009; van Beek et al., 
2009), trait anxiety and depression (Wakefield et al., 2010; Anagnostopoulos and Griva, 
2011), psychological distress (Holman & Silver, 2005; Fieulaine & Apostolidis, 2007) 
and psychopathology (van Beek et al., 2011). Research indicates that: depression and past 
positive time perspective are negatively related and that past negative time perspective 
and present fatalism are positively correlated with depression (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999).   
Investigations of suicidal ideation reveal that past negative and present fatalism 
predict suicidal ideation (Laghi et al., 2009) and, in the same study, a past positive time 
perspective negated suicidal ideation as it provided subjects with a stable sense of 
continuity or roots (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Suicidal ideation is linked with a sense of 
hopelessness because individuals lack positivity about the future (Mac Leod et al. cited in 
Van Beek et al., 2009, p 2) and increasing future time perspective among this group may 
negate suicidal ideation. In a further study, van Beek et al. (2011) found that present 
fatalism and past negative correlated positively with depression and that past negative was 
indicative of psychopathology problems.  
4.3.2.1 Addiction 
Time perspective is related to substance misuse (Goldberg & Maslach, 1996; Petry et 
al., 1998; Keough et al., 1999; Wills et al., 2001; Apostolidis et al., 2006a; Apostolidis et 

 
85 
 
al., 2006b; Pluck et al., 2008; Fieulaine & Martinez, 2010), gambling (Hodgins & Engel, 
2002; MacKillop et al., 2006a; MacKillop et al., 2006b) and addiction to online gaming 
(Lukavska, 2012). The predominant finding among researchers is that present hedonism is 
positively related to substance use and future time perspective is negatively related to use 
and consumption of drugs and alcohol (Wills et al., 2001; Apostolidis et al., 2006a; 
Daugherty & Brase, 2009). A study of alcoholics enrolled in an abstinence programme 
indicated that future  time perspective predicted long term abstinence from alcohol 
(Lennings, 1996).  
Recent research has explored the relationship between time perspective and the 
amount of time spent playing online games (Lukavska, 2012). The research found that the 
number of hours per week (HPW) and the number of hours per session (HPS) spent in 
online gaming was positively correlated with present fatalism. Future time perspective 
was negatively related to (HPS) and (HPW). Surprisingly, present hedonism was 
unrelated to both (HPS) and (HPW). Time perspectives are also related to more positive 
health outcomes such as well-being. 
4.3.2 Outcomes-well-being 
Well-being can be defined in terms of life satisfaction, positive and negative effect, 
actualization potential (Boniwell et al., 2010), and in terms of subjective happiness and 
mindfulness (Drake et al., 2008). Investigators have examined relationships between time 
perspective and well-being (Zimbardo & Boniwell, 2004; Drake et al., 2008; Boniwell, 
2009; Boniwell et al., 2010) and found that past positive was significantly and positively 
related to happiness. Well-being was negatively and significantly correlated with past 
negative, and present hedonism showed significant and positive correlations with 
subjective happiness, self-efficacy and optimism (Boniwell et al., 2010). Future time 
perspective was positively and significantly correlated with life satisfaction, purpose in 

 
86 
 
life and optimism while past positive was positively and significantly related to 
satisfaction with life, subjective happiness, purpose in life and optimism. Present fatalism 
correlated negatively and significantly with life satisfaction, subjective happiness, purpose 
in life self-efficacy and optimism.  
4.3.3 Outcomes-academic  
Education is a means of socializing individuals to think about the future. However in 
schools, pupils do not always see the present-future link in terms of completing their 
education. A statistically significant and positive correlation between delay discounting 
and academic attainment was found by Freeney and O'Connell (2011) in a study of early 
school leavers. The present-future link in academic settings is also found using present 
and future time perspectives. 
In educational settings the ZTPI relates to academic outcomes such as academic 
achievement (Mello & Worrell, 2006; Adelabu, 2007; Barber et al., 2009), academic 
engagement (Horstmanshof & Zimitat, 2007), achievement goals and study strategies 
(Phan, 2009), signing up for experiments (Harber et al., 2003), procrastination (Ferrari & 
Díaz-Morales, 2007; Díaz-Morales et al., 2008) and the seriousness of academic cheating 
(Worrell & Mello, 2007). In general, future time perspective positively predicts academic 
outcomes and these outcomes are negatively predicted by present oriented time 
perspectives. The future time perspective is generally positively correlated with grade 
point average as a measure of academic achievement (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Mello & 
Worrell, 2006; Barber et al., 2009) while present fatalism and present hedonism were 
significant and negative correlates of grade point average (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; 
Mello &Worrell, 2006; Worrell & Mello, 2007; Barber et al., 2009). 
Obtaining an educational qualification requires the student to get involved in 
university studies or to engage academically. The relationship between time perspective 

 
87 
 
and academic engagement indicates that students with a future time perspective were 
more likely to spend more hours studying, were academically conscientious, adopted deep 
and surface level learning approaches and liked academic endeavours (Horstmanshof & 
Zimitat, 2007). 
Goal setting is inherently connected with time (Fried & Slowik, 2004) and students 
achieve academic success through goal setting. Future time perspective predicted mastery 
goals, performance approach, performance avoidance goals, deep processing and effort 
among a sample of university students (Phan, 2009). Future time perspective also plays a 
role in school retention and academic engagement among African American adolescents 
by promoting acceptance of and a sense of belonging in school relative to a present 
hedonistic time perspective (Adelabu, 2007).    
4.3.4 Outcome-procrastination 
Risks to achieving academically include procrastination which ―concerns a person‘s 
ability to meet deadlines‖(Ferrari & Díaz-Morales, 2007) or as an‖ irrational tendency to 
delay beginning and/or completing tasks that should be completed‖ (Lay 1986, cited in 
Jackson et al., 2003, p 17). Studies examining the relationship between time perspective 
and procrastination indicate an ambiguous relationship (Jackson et al., 2003; Ferrari & 
Díaz-Morales, 2007; Díaz-Morales et al., 2008). Procrastination was positively and 
significantly correlated with past negative, present fatalism, present hedonism and 
negatively and significantly correlated with future time perspective. Past positive was 
unrelated to procrastination (Jackson et al., 2003).  
Procrastination can be described in terms of avoidant procrastination and arousal 
procrastination (Lay, 1986). Avoidant procrastination refers to putting something off due 
to a dislike of the activity while arousal procrastinators delay due to other commitments 
(Ferrari & Díaz-Morales, 2007). These authors propose that different forms of 

 
88 
 
procrastination are related to time perspectives. Future time perspective was significantly 
and negatively related to avoidant procrastination while present hedonism and present 
fatalism were significantly negative correlates of avoidant procrastination. These results 
were also supported by Díaz-Morales et al. (2008). 
Arousal procrastination had significant and positive relationships between present 
fatalism, present hedonism and past negative time perspectives. Future time perspective 
was positively and significantly related to avoidant procrastination. Indecision as a form 
of procrastination was studied by Díaz-Morales et al. (2008), who indicated positive and 
significant correlations between past negative, past positive and present fatalism. The 
research also indicated that future time perspective and indecision were significantly and 
negatively correlated.  
The relationship between time perspective and procrastination has also been studied 
in the work place (Gupta et al., 2012) and this research found that procrastination was 
negatively predicted by future time perspective, present hedonism and past negative time 
perspectives. In the work place, procrastination was positively predicted by present 
fatalism. Time perspective is embedded in other work place outcomes, but this literature is 
theoretical and applied to teams. 
4.3.5 Outcomes-organizations 
Although much is written on time and organizations, research on time perspective is 
scant within an organizational context. The state of the literature relating the ZTPI to 
organizational settings examines time perspective or time orientation in the context of 
diversity within multinational teams. Research describes propositions between time 
perspective and deadlines (Waller et al., 2001), time perspective heterogeneity and its 
predictors and outcomes (Gibson et al., 2008), time orientation and multinational teams 
(Arman & Adair, 2012) and shared temporal cognitions in present and future time 

 
89 
 
perspectives (Bartel & Milliken, 2004). Bartel‘s research indicated that future time 
perspective was not shared among teams and remained an individual difference variable.  
Waller and colleagues (2001) considered relationships between time urgency and time 
perspective to create four team roles based on deadline perception: the visioner, the 
organizer, the relator and the crammer. Each role is based on the interaction of time 
urgency (low- high), present time perspective and future time perspective. Crammers and 
organizers are characterized by high time urgency, but the crammer is present oriented 
while the organizer is future oriented.  The relator and the visioner are represented by low 
time urgency. The relator is present oriented and the visioner is future oriented. These 
different roles interplay to influence the perceptions of deadlines as an outcome.  
Gibson et al. (2008) discuss the antecedents, outcomes and mediators of time 
perspective heterogeneity in global teams. The authors suggest that time perspective 
heterogeneity is an important aspect of teams who work across multicultural 
environments which experience environmental volatility.  The theme of time perspective 
heterogeneity is also examined in Arman and Adair (2012) who theorize about the 
relationship between group processes and different time perspectives. The authors argue 
that groups described by a present time orientation will focus on immediate goals while 
those with a future time orientation will attend to distal goals.   
Organizations are moving toward environmental sustainability where individuals and 
groups are encouraged to adopt pro environmental or greening behaviour (Andersson et 
al., 2013).The special issue on greening behaviour in the Journal of Organization 
Behaviour did not incorporate time perspective which has implications for sustainable  
behaviour. 
4.3.6 Outcomes-sustainable behaviour 
Studies of sustainable behaviour indicate that: future time perspective predicts water 

 
90 
 
conservation (Corral-Verdugo, 2006) is positively correlated with environmental 
preservation (Milfont & Gouveia, 2006) and future time perspective plays a key role in 
influencing attitudes and behaviours toward the environment (Milfont et al., 2012). In the 
same study past positive is positively correlated with environmental preservation while 
present fatalism demonstrated a negative correlation.  
To conclude, section three of the chapter; it appears that the literature using time 
perspective as a predictor far outweighs research on antecedents. Future time perspective 
has predicted positive health and mental health outcomes and future time perspective has 
emerged as a health protector. Water conservation and sustainable behaviour shows a 
positive relationship with future time perspective. Within education settings student 
achievement and goal attainment are positively predicted by future time perspective. 
Present hedonism predicts risky health behaviours, addiction and substance misuse. Past 
negative and present fatalism predict suicidal ideation. There is a virtual absence of 
temporal research when time perspective is contrasted against the prevailing temporal 
research agenda. 
4.4 CHAPTER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Research on the dispositional view of time perspective appears diverse and 
unconnected. This research is largely timeless which is evident from the discussion on 
antecedents and outcomes of the different time perspectives, and it lacks a temporal 
research agenda. The predominant conceptualization of time perspective is that of a stable 
individual difference variable (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Waller et al., 2001; Gibson et al., 
2008), and is described as a personality trait (Levy & Earleywine, 2004; Milfont et al., 
2008; Boniwell, 2009; Ely & Mercurio, 2011; Carelli & Wiberg, 2011) or disposition 

 
91 
 
(Mischel, 2004) which demonstrate relatively little change over time and across 
situations. 
It appears that researchers are highly invested in expanding time perspective‘s 
nomological network, which is described as an interlocking system of laws that 
constitutes a theory where theoretical constructs are related to other theoretical constructs 
and observed variables (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). The purpose of expanding time 
perspective‘s nomological network is to learn more about the construct (Cronbach & 
Meehl, 1955). The network indicates an increasing interest in establishing criterion 
validity, it has grown over time, but we know very little about time in the network. 
Building the nomological network is based on finding significant correlations between a 
number of theoretical constructs and observed variables (Van Erde, 2003). Time 
perspective continues to demonstrate methodological misfit (Edmondson & McManus, 
2007) by defining it as a process on one hand and on the other, using variables to make 
predictions about processes and a similar observation was made in the team literature 
(Roe et al., 2012). 
From Figure 8 it is clear that time perspective researchers have ignored a persistent 
issue which is the stability and malleability of time perspective (Seijts, 1998). Research 
output reflects substantial growth in individual differences which is supported by retest 
designs. Clearly, there is a lack of research examining rank order consistency over longer 
time periods where changes in temporal stability can be tested. Current time perspective, 
is preoccupied with prediction, and assumes that rank order consistency rules out the 
possibility of change. Time perspective research has evolved on the assumption that 
continuity and change is not multilevel and that time perspectives are stable or not.  
Studying continuity and change requires longitudinal designs of more than two 
occasions so that individual records can capture continuity and change and cyclical 

 
92 
 
patterns (McGrath & Tschan, 2004). The few longitudinal studies available (Holman & 
Zimbardo, 2009; Luyckx et al., 2010; Holman, 2011) indicate mean level changes in time 
perspective as well as rank order consistency. Despite this small literature, investigators 
have not connected continuity and change with levels of analysis and assume to 
generalize continuity indicated by rank order continuity to other levels. Investigators need 
to know about the duration over which a theory is valid i.e. the long term stability and 
change of time perspectives and there is little research advancing knowledge on this topic. 
Continuity and change in time perspective remains under researched. To examine 
questions of stability and change, the field should shift its focus to longitudinal designs 
(Seijts, 1998).

Chapter 5  
Continuity and change 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The aim of chapter five is to introduce the research questions by problematizing the 
dispositional view of time perspective espoused by Zimbardo and Boyd, (1999) in terms 
of in-house, paradigmatic and ideological assumptions and to place time perspective 
within discussions on continuity and change taken from personality development 
research.  
Section one of the chapter highlights important assumptions that need surfacing: in-
house assumptions, paradigmatic assumptions and ideological assumptions. Section two 
examines paradigmatic and ideological assumptions in more detail, and introduces an 
idealized framework for the study of change. Section three argues the case for continuity 
and change in time perspective using evidence from personality development and other 
dispositional constructs that demonstrate both continuity and change. The chapter closes 
with discussions and conclusions, and outlines the research questions. 
 
The chapter concludes by suggesting that the present understanding of continuity and 
change in time perspective is limited and a broader understanding is possible if time 
perspective is placed within a multifaceted and multilevel view of continuity and change. 
The chapter follows the layout shown in Figure 9.

5.1 PROBLEMATIZING CONTINUITY OR CHANGE  
The objective of the section one of the chapter is to suggest that researchers should 
focus on the coexistence of continuity and change as a theme rather than on their mutual 
exclusivity by acknowledging that continuity and change are multifaceted and multilevel.  
5.1.1 Problematization  
Problematization is an ―endeavour to know how, and to what extent it might be 
possible to think differently about what is already known‖ (Foucault 1985, p.9 cited in 
Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011, p.253). To rally support for problematization, a typology of 
assumptions underpinning a field such as: in-house assumptions, root metaphor 
assumptions, paradigmatic assumptions, ideological assumptions and field assumptions is 
presented in (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011).  
In-house assumptions apply to a specific school of thought such as trait theories i.e. 
constructs are assumed to be trait like. Root metaphors are used to describe the boarder  
images of a topic and are used to conceptualize reality (Morgan, 1980). Ontological, 
epistemological and methodological assumptions underpin specific literatures and these 
assumptions define the nature of reality and the methods of inquiry to study that reality 
i.e. these assumptions are paradigmatic in that they define a world view (Morgan, 1980).  
Ideological assumptions refer to political, moral and gender-related assumptions relating 
to the subject matter. Field assumptions reflect wider beliefs about the subject matter that 
are held by a variety of different school of thought within and occasionally across 
paradigms. By challenging a select assumptions underpinning a view, it may have a larger 
payoff relative to questioning a wide array of assumptions (Sandberg & Alvesson, 2011) 
and the assumptions selected for discussion in section one are: in-house, paradigmatic and 
ideological.  

 
96 
 
5.1.2 In-house assumptions 
5.1.2.1 Current thinking 
In house assumptions focus on conceptualizations of continuity or change and 
assumptions about the measurement of change and continuity. The dispositional view of 
time perspective appears to hold that continuity and change are opposite ends of a 
spectrum and are mutually exclusive and that they are generalizable from a group to an 
individual. The dispositional view of time perspective suggests that it is stable (Waller et 
al., 2001; Gibson et al., 2008), is described as a personality trait (Levy & Earleywine, 
2004; Milfont et al., 2008; Boniwell, 2009), is considered as a dispositional style or 
individual difference variable (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and as such ―represents a 
tendency to behave in certain kinds of ways if in certain kinds of situations ,‖(Caspi & 
Shiner, 2006, p 301). The dispositional approach involves measuring personal attributes to 
explain behaviour and dispositions, and terms such as traits, personality, and individual 
characteristics are often used interchangeably (Staw & Ross, 1985), and these terms 
describe enduring and stable psychological differences between persons and are regarded 
as static (Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989; Caspi & Shiner, 2006).  
Stability has a number of different meanings within the psychology literature, (Taris 
et al., 1998); it refers to an enduring pattern of behaviour that is inflexible and stable over 
time, (Lozenweger et al., 2004). It is described as consistent which reflect ―enduring 
qualities that contribute to personal tendencies and stable individual differences,‖ 
(Cervone, 2004, p 184). Stability is also described in terms of different labels such as 
consistency versus discriminativeness (Funder, 1994), invariance and variability (Mischel, 
2004), consistency versus change (Cervone, 2004), disposition versus dynamics (Mischel, 
1973) and the person versus the situation (Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989). Other 

 
97 
 
interpretations outlined by Rogosa (1995) include (a) the consistency over time of an 
individual (b) the consistency over time of the average individual, (c) the consistency over 
time of individual differences. The term stability is argued to be misleading and 
ambiguous because it denotes something that does not change (Roberts et al., 2008). A 
common practice among individual difference researchers is to assume that the presence 
of rank order continuity is the gold standard for asserting continuity. This unidimensional 
view has been challenged in personality development (Watson & Humrichouse, 2006; 
Blonigen et al., 2008; Vaidya et al., 2008a) and in literature examining achievement goals 
(Fryer & Elliot, 2007; Muis & Edwards, 2009). This confusion can be resolved by taking 
a multifaceted and multilevel approach to continuity and change.  
5.1.2.2 Continuity and change as multifaceted 
Problematizing continuity or change shows that there is an opportunity to embrace 
an alternative position that suggests the coexistence of continuity and change. 
Coexistence of continuity and change presents alternative views in addition to rank order 
consistency and helps to dispel the myth that the presence of rank order consistency 
excludes other forms of continuity and change. The dispositional view of time perspective 
fails to consider that continuity and change have a variety of meanings and can be 
operationalized differently (Vaidya et al., 2008a).  
Roberts et al. (2008) classified continuity and change into (1) differential continuity, 
(2) mean level change (3) individual differences in change (4) ipsative continuity and (5) 
structural continuity and this is outlined in Table 5. To illustrate the point a boat analogy 
is used by (Edmonds et al., 2008). The analogy indicates that each form of continuity and 
change is independent. From the perspective of rank order consistency, each boat has a 
place to dock relative to other boats and this position is retained over time. Mean level 
change is reflected by the rise and fall of boats with the tide. Individual differences in

change regard each boat as having different sizes and weights. Although the classification 
of continuity and change outlined is based on personality, it can provide some insights 
into clarifications in time perspective research. Table 5 highlights a rigorous approach to 
the study of continuity and change. The study of continuity and change has historically 
been problematic (Bereiter, 1963; Cronbach & Furby, 1970; Edwards & Parry, 1993). 
Early measures of change  such as the difference score were criticised on the grounds of 
unreliability (Willett, 1994). However, clinical researchers have developed measures of 
individual change to correct for the unreliability of difference scores such as the reliable 
change index (Jacobson & Truax, 1991; Wise, 2004).  
Investigations examining change and continuity have led researchers to adopt 
approaches such as latent growth modeling and rigorous invariance testing procedures to 
rule out the sources of error that might contribute to spurious change (Golembiewski et 
al., 1976; Vandenberg & Lance, 2000; Lance et al., 2000). Table 5 can be used to direct 
research effort to examine trait like properties for continuity and change using the group 
and individual level of analysis.

5.1.2.3 Continuity and change as multifaceted-differential continuity 
Differential continuity appears to receive most attention among time perspective 
researchers. Test-retest reliability is a measure of sample stability over time, (Nunnally & 
Bernstein, 1994; Terracciano et al., 2010) and is assessed by administering the same test 
to the same subjects at two points in time (Cronbach & Furby,1970). Large retest 
coefficients are believed to indicate greater continuity, or lack of change across time or 
that all individuals changed in the same way because they all experienced a normative 
event, but the size of the coefficient is not informative about the underlying processes of 
stability and change. Test-retest correlations of 0 indicate that a construct does not 
demonstrate rank order consistency while a value of 1 indicates strong rank order 
consistency , and values in between represent a grey area ―where implications of the data 
for theory become elusive,‖(Fraley & Roberts, 2005, p 62).  
Test–retest correlations have received much criticism (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). 
Firstly, the appropriate length of the interval between test and re-test depends on the 
stability of the variables selected, for example, a year might be too long for an opinion 
item but appropriate for a psychological measure. The test-retest correlation value 
depends on the space between test and retest and, in general, the longer the interval 
between testing the lower the temporal stability coefficient (Watson, 2004). 
Secondly, an assumption made about test-retest reliability is that test takers do not or have 
not changed over the time period of the two administrations. Correlations and covariances 
in a sample are collective measures that provide population information (Danziger, 1990; 
Grice, 2004; Lamiell 2004, cited in Hamaker et al., 2005, p. 209) and for a researcher to 
generalize from a sample to the individual assumes that there is homology across levels. 
The presence of practice or carryover effects enables respondents to solve problems more 
quickly the second time which can make the test-retest correlation between responses 

 
100 
 
spuriously high. Watson (2004) suggested that scholars have adopted an uncritical use of 
test-retest designs.  
Under the test-retest design, stability is framed as a dichotomous outcome where 
something is considered stable or not. Significant retest correlations cannot be accepted as 
evidence of stability because they only indicate one‘s relative position within the group 
(Davis-Blake & Pfeffer, 1989; Newton & Keenan, 1991) and cannot be used to confirm 
the presence of absolute change or stability of dispositional effects. Claims of continuity 
require support from mean continuity and continuity at the individual level. Differential 
continuity is limited in its capacity to capture growth and maturity unlike mean level 
continuity (Vaidya et al., 2008b). 
5.1.2.4 Continuity and change as multifaceted- mean level continuity 
The second type of continuity refers to mean level continuity. Mean level change 
describes the extent to which the average amount of the construct changes over time 
within a population (Trzesniewski et al., 2004; Fryer & Elliot, 2007, p 702) or the extent 
to which personality scores change over time (De Fruyt et al., 2006), and is equated with 
normative change (Ludtke et al., 2009). Normative change suggests that people show the 
same changes during a specific time in the lifespan and are thought to occur from 
maturational or historical processes shared by a population (Helson & Moane 1997 cited 
in Roberts & Wood, 2006, p.20). Mean level change is analysed by comparing means 
across measurement occasions and is distinct from rank order continuity (Trzesniewski et 
al., 2004). Studies by Roberts and Del Vecchio, (2000); Roberts et al., (2006b) 
demonstrated both mean level change and rank order consistency in personality, which 
indicates that the two types of continuity can coexist.  

 
101 
 
5.1.2.5 Continuity and change as multifaceted-ipsative continuity 
Ipsative continuity represents ―the level of stability and change in an individual‘s 
configuration of constructs over time‖ (Fryer & Elliot, 2007, p. 702). Ipsative continuity 
can be described in terms of the level, pattern and scatter of scores. Changes in profile 
shape are measured using person level Q correlations. A high Q correlation indicates 
stability across time in the individual‘s configuration of constructs. Scatter is measured 
using the within person standard deviation and a positive scatter coefficient indicates 
dispersal over time while a negative coefficient indicates the profile dispersion declines 
over time. 
5.1.2.6 Continuity and change as multifaceted- structural continuity 
Structural continuity describes the researcher‘s interest in the factor structure and 
pattern of correlations that persists among a set of variables. Cross cultural studies using 
the five time perspectives appears to support structural continuity. Some studies appear to 
indicate 4-6 factor solutions (Worrell & Mello, 2007; Anagnostopoulos & Griva, 2011; 
Carelli & Wiberg, 2011) and attempts to shorten the ZTPI scale have resulted in three 
factor solution (D'Alessio et al., 2003). 
5.1.2.7 Continuity and change as multifaceted-Individual differences in change 
Change and continuity can be examined at the level of the individual and change is 
defined as an absence of continuity (Caspi, 1998). Individual level change describes 
increases or decreases in the trait by a person (De Fruyt et al., 2006). Within personality 
literature, individual change in a construct over time is measured using the reliable change 
index (RCI) and growth modeling. The reliable change index RCI emerged from the 
psychotherapy literature and indicates whether meaningful individual change has occurred 
by gauging the actual change resulting from an intervention against what could be 

 
102 
 
expected, given the measure‘s reliability (Roberts et al., 2008). Studies using the RCI 
have indicated reliable change in personality traits that are not attributed to measurement 
error at different life stages (Roberts et al., 2008). The RCI demonstrated that individual 
level changes coincided with mean level changes (Vaidya et al., 2008b) in personality 
studies. The different facets of continuity and change are used to examine research on 
time perspective using the ZTPI and the comparisons are outlined in Table 6. 
The table indicates that researchers over emphasize rank order consistency over 
other facets of continuity and they appear to assume that group level measures of 
continuity are generalizable to the individual level of analysis. Researchers continue to 
use two period designs and focus on group level measures of continuity. The table 
highlights the methodological decisions underpinning the dispositional view of time 
perspective which are largely informed by paradigmatic and ideological assumptions. The 
three aspects of continuity and change that are of interest to the present research are rank 
order continuity, mean level continuity and individual differences in change.  
To summarize, continuity and change are multilevel and have different 
interpretations and a broad brush approach to continuity provides an unbalanced 
description without consideration of alternative views. 
5.2 PARADIGMATIC AND IDEOLOGICAL 
ASSUMPTIONS. 
The aim of section two is to examine paradigmatic and ideological assumptions 
underpinning the dispositional view of time perspective. The section shows that these 
assumptions are challenged by adopting multiwave designs and methodologies that 
examine individual and group level change and continuity.

Paradigmatic assumptions address ontological, epistemological and methodological 
assumptions underpinning an existing literature (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011). Research 
paradigms represent different ways of thinking about the world (Blaikie, 2007) and 
research paradigms inform the logic of enquiry and choice of research methods. The 
section offers a critique of the paradigmatic assumptions behind the dispositional 
approach to time perspective such differential thinking and its associated research 
methods and designs, and argues that continuity and change in time perspective should be 
considered at the individual level and group level. The section also presents ideological 
assumptions which question the preoccupation with continuity. 
5.2.1.1 Paradigmatic assumptions -differential thinking  
Differential thinking is examined from a research methods and research design 
perspective. The study of individual differences occurs through differential psychology 
which  
comprises the psychometric assessments of abilities, personality, and vocational 
interests, with special emphasis devoted to their real world significance and their 
developmental antecedents. Topics of interest included educational , interpersonal  
and vocational behaviours, especially those relevant to facilitating optimal adjustment 
to life and work and tailoring opportunities for positive growth,(Lubinski, 2000, p. 
406). 
A standard approach in psychology is the study of interindividual variation or 
individual differences (Nesselroade, 2002). Central to differential psychology is 
correlational research which focuses on ―the structure of associations between variables 
on which people differ‖ (Borsboom et al., 2009, p. 5). Continuity and change are often 
considered as dichotomous outcomes. This view has been criticized because the emphasis 
on stability deemphasizes change and vice versa (Funder, 1994).  
 
Researchers have used the two period design to examine continuity and change but 

 
105 
 
the two wave design has been critiqued extensively in favour of multiwave designs 
(Willett, 1994). Rather than contend with just group level analysis, some commentators 
have switched attention to individual differences in change to suggest that some 
individuals may demonstrate change in a construct over time while others do not 
(Mroczek and Spiro, 2003). According to Nesselroade (2002), researchers identify 
differences by making comparisons: (a) among kinds of entities, (b) among homogenous 
entities (inter individual differences-IEV) and (c) within the same entities across different 
measurement occasions (intraindividual differences -IAV). Nesselroade (2002, p. 545) 
suggests that ―a change is inferred to have occurred when a difference is sustained across 
a series of comparisons of the same entity and only comparisons within the same entity 
over different occasions (intraindividual differences) contain information about the 
change processes‖.  
The individual differences approach describes change and continuity among persons, 
and it is the standard approach to conceptualizing individual differences (Mroczek et al., 
2003). To provide a more informative description of individual differences life span 
development psychologists such as Baltes et al. (1980) suggested that assumptions of trait 
like properties should be accompanied by an examination of intra individual variability 
and issues of continuity and change must contain information on the average level of a 
construct and individual variability in the level of that construct. This suggestion is 
embedded in research that investigates interindividual differences in intraindividual 
change. 
5.2.1.2 Problematizing paradigmatic assumptions –toward continuity and change 
Within differential psychology, more temporally suited approaches to the study of 
continuity and change is to examine it from the perspective of the group, individual or 
both, using methodological advances such as latent growth models and random 

 
106 
 
coefficient modeling (Mitchell & James, 2001; Little et al., 2006). Current perspectives 
examining continuity and change view them as coexisting rather than mutually exclusive. 
These methods integrate both intra individual change and inter individual differences in 
intra individual change (Nesselroade, 2002).  
Growth models provide an intersection between individual and group attributes 
(Curran & Hussong, 2003). In their review, Curran and Wirth, (2004) argue in favour of 
the suitability of IEV methods to investigate interindividual differences in intraindividual 
change. This view uses a pair of statistical models: (a) a model for individual growth and 
(b) a model for how individual growth parameters vary across individuals (Rogosa, 1987). 
Growth models and hierarchical linear models are used to study time embedded data 
(Mitchell & James, 2001) and ―these techniques can tell us if and when a variable 
changes‖ (Mitchell & James, 2001, p.542) thereby making time central to theory and 
falsification of that theory. The key to understanding individual change over time is the 
trajectory and multiple measurement occasions across many subjects to obtain 
information on the homogeneity and heterogeneity of individual and group trajectories 
(Mitchell & James, 2001).   
The use of statistical methods such as growth modeling require longitudinal designs 
to describe an individual‘s trajectory and an individual trajectory explicitly models 
different approximations of chronological time such as age or measurement occasions 
(Singer & Willet, 2003). Trajectories are described as smooth curves that describe 
individual change (Raudenbush, 2001) and these trajectories are then used to examine 
individual differences in change by summarizing evidence across individual trajectories. 
Trajectories move the study of change away from dichotomous conceptualization of 
continuity and change toward richer descriptions, where individuals may be changing at 
increasing or decreasing rates or individuals may demonstrate differences in continuity. 

 
107 
 
The logical foundation for all longitudinal analysis is thus a statistical model defining 
parameters of change for the trajectory of a single participant. The task of comparing 
people then becomes the task of comparing the parameters of these personal 
trajectories. A model is thus needed for the population distribution of the parameters 
for personal change, (Raudenbush, 2001, p. 502).   
 
Approaches to the study of change such as growth modeling arose from the 
contentious debate on the measurement of change. The study of change measurement has 
been controversial (Bereiter, 1963; Cronbach & Furby, 1970; Rogosa et al., 1982; Rogosa, 
1995; Lance et al., 2000; Edwards, 2002). Scholars have tried to measure change using 
descriptive statistics, change scores, t-tests, Anova or Manova regression, lagged 
regressions, and survival analysis (Lance et al., 2000). Lance et al (2000) have critiqued 
these approaches and argued that change can be measured successfully using latent 
growth modeling and the authors develop an idealized approach to individual and group 
change.  
To investigate interindividual differences in intraindividual change, Chan (1998) and 
Lance et al. (2000) developed frameworks to guide researchers on conceptualizing 
individual change in much broader terms. The origins of these frameworks emerged from 
development psychology where the study of change is the rule and not the exception 
(Chan, 1998). This idealized approach is presented in Table 7 which guides researchers on 
identifying interindividual differences in intraindividual change in constructs that 
demonstrated rank order and mean level consistency. The framework will be used in 
section three of this chapter to illustrate some examples of research investigating 
interindividual differences in intra individual change in personality (Mroczek & Spiro, 
2003), temperament, self-esteem (Partridge & Lerner, 2007), self-concept (Scheier et al., 
2000) and procrastination (Moon & Illingworth, 2005) and it will be used to shape the 
research questions for time perspective.

5.2.3 Ideological assumptions 
Section two of chapter five suggests that ideological assumptions blind researchers to the 
study of continuity and change. Ideological assumptions emphasize a moral perspective 
which is used to evaluate the kind of research that is acceptable to a research community. 
 
5.2.3.1. Ideological assumptions -current thinking 
The ideological assumption underpinning time perspective is that the purpose of 
science, in the positivist sense, is to generate invariant laws and a ―science‖ that cannot 
generate invariant laws may not be viewed as a science at all. These laws are laid out in 
time perspectives nomological network governing the relationship between constructs. If 
indeed it is ―better science‖ to establish invariant laws, research efforts will focus on 
establishing continuity rather than change. There is a difficulty with establishing invariant 
laws in that they require time to test. The time interval chosen is central to the test of 
invariance of these laws, but time perspective researchers have not embraced the view 

 
109 
 
that the study of change is as equally important. There is the possibility that temporal 
research may criticize the validity of the relationships based on these laws by questioning 
the duration over which they hold.  
To summarize, in-house, paradigmatic and ideological assumptions have shaped the 
dispositional view of time perspective. These assumptions have been challenged to show 
that continuity and change are evident in personality by showing that they are multilevel 
and independent rather than mutually exclusive at the group and the individual levels of 
analysis.  
The study of individual differences has traditionally focused on population indices at 
the cost of examining individual differences in intra individual change (Mroczek et al., 
2006). Time perspective continues to follow this route by emphasising the continued 
preference for continuity or change, cross sectional designs and correlational research. 
This perspective stems from in-house, paradigmatic and ideological assumptions which 
reinforce technical certainty and consensus within differential thinking. Questions of 
continuity and change are legitimate under the current temporal research agenda.  
5.3 CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN TRAITS AND 
DISPOSITIONS 
The purpose of section three of the chapter is to build the logic for the research 
questions which examine the coexistence of continuity and change in time perspective. 
The section draws on debates in continuity and change in other literatures which can offer 
insights into change and continuity in time perspective. The discussion of continuity and 
change in chapter one shows that it is multilevel and ranges from the strategic to the 
individual level of analysis. Sections one and two of this chapter showed that researchers 
have moved away from considering continuity and change as mutually exclusive to 

 
110 
 
acknowledging their coexistence. Support for the view that time perspective may 
demonstrate continuity and change at the group and individual level is drawn mainly from 
personality development which is used to build a case for continuity and change time in 
perspective.   
5.3.1 Continuity and change -personality development principles 
Personality traits can be conceptualized as enduring attributes of an individual and 
personality can be described in terms of state or transitory personal attributes. The focus 
of the research is on continuity and change in time perspective and, to achieve this 
objective, a comparable debate is required using personality traits. At a population level, 
personality increases in rank order consistency with age, demonstrates normative or mean 
level change and is capable of demonstrating individual differences in change (Edmonds 
et al., 2008). Roberts et al. (2008) suggest that the benefit of studying the coexistence of 
continuity and change in personality is that it forces researchers to seek explanations for 
continuity and change. Personality development occurs according to number principles 
(Roberts et al., 2006) outlined in Table 8 which illustrates the variety of principles which 
provide a rationale for continuity and change in personality. Personality demonstrates 
continuity and change and highlights the current deficit within the theory of time 
perspective developed by Zimbardo and Boyd (1999). 
5.3.1.1 Cumulative continuity principle 
The cumulative continuity principle appears to be well supported across the lifespan. 
Personality increases in rank order consistency from childhood to adulthood and then 
plateaus between age 50 and 70 (Roberts & Del Vecchio, 2000).  
 
5.3.1.2 Maturity principle 
The maturity principle suggests that as people age they become more socially dominant, 

 
111 
 
agreeable, conscientious and emotionally stable between the ages of 20 and 40 (Caspi & 
Roberts, 1999; Roberts & Wood, 2006). The maturity principle is reflected in mean level 
changes in personality. Personality development among a sample of 18-26 year olds 
indicated that transition to young adulthood from adolescence is marked by personality 
continuity and change in favour of greater maturity (Roberts et al., 2001). A study among 
21-60 year olds highlighted mean level increases in conscientiousness and agreeableness 
across early and middle adulthood but women indicated mean level declines in 
neuroticism, relative to men (Srivastava et al., 2003).

Mature people become more liked and respected within their community and these 
qualities serve societal functioning (Hogan & Roberts, 2004). In terms of functioning, 
mature people tend to be more successful in their careers (Judge et al., 1999) have better 
health (Spiro et al., 1995) and live longer (Danner et al., 2001).  
5.3.1.3 Social investment principle 
Adulthood is a time where individuals commit to roles as parents, in careers and 
family and in the community. Midlife represents a period when one is preoccupied with 
family , marital relationships and child rearing (MacDermid & Crouter 1995, cited in van 
Aken et al., 2006, p 498). Although much of the work on personality change involves 
young adults, adulthood represents a time where individuals are going through important 
changes in life goals, resources and coping styles which are influenced by changing 
environments (Helson et al., 2002) and midlife is often mistakenly taken as a period of 
stability and consolidation, however individual personality adapts to midlife concerns 
(Neyer, 2006). Individual difference in personality change may arise because individuals 
are exposed to a wide variety of environmental influences (Roberts, 1997) such as life 
events which we experience in the normative course of development. Mean increases in 
agreeableness may reflect greater social reward rather than rejection (Caspi & Roberts, 
1999) while aging is accompanied by mean level declines in social vitality and openness 
(Roberts et al., 2006b). 
Social investment theory has been used to explain personality change in midlife (van 
Aken et al., 2006) and in young adulthood (Roberts et al., 2005; Lehnart et al., 2010). 
Social investment theory (Roberts et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2006a; Lodi-Smith & 
Roberts, 2007) is defined as ―investment in, and psychological commitment to, adult 
social roles‖ and focuses on the transactional and stochastic factors that might explain 
personality development. Roles represent a social context, and roles prescribe and 

 
113 
 
facilitate ―behaviour through norms and scripted relationships (Roberts & Donahue, 1994, 
p 201). The implications for personality development arising from the social investment 
principle indicates that dominance, conscientiousness and agreeableness and emotional 
stability increase over time i.e. people mature as they get older (Wood & Roberts, 2006). 
The social investment principle is also supported among young adults who experienced 
declines in neuroticism when they first enter long term romantic relationships (Lehnart et 
al., 2010)  
5.3.1.4 Correspondence principle 
The correspondence principle links social selection and social influence (Caspi et al., 
2005). The corresponsive principle suggests that individuals choose roles or jobs because 
they correspond to particular personality traits which changes as a result of occupying the 
position. ―Life experiences are corresponsive if they elicit behaviour consistent with their 
disposition‖(Roberts & Wood, 2006,p.22). By way of illustration, a person who is more 
socially dominant chooses roles with more power which, in turn, is associated with 
increases in social dominance. In a longitudinal study of university students, individuals 
who were less agreeable and emotionally stable tended to fit within the competitive 
university environment, and individuals who fitted into that environment tended to be less 
agreeable and more emotionally stable (Roberts & Robins, 2004).  
Another study conducted among young adults aged between 18 and 26 found that 
that traits that predicted work related outcomes were the ones that changed in relation to 
those work experiences (Roberts et al., 2003). Further empirical support for the 
corresponsive principle is argued by Harms et al., (2006), who found a relationship 
between person –environment fit and openness to experience among a sample of Harvard 
students. Research conducted by Roberts et al. (2004) supported the corresponsive 
principle among a sample of young adults investigating the relationship between life goal 

 
114 
 
domains  and personality. The results indicated that the relationship between life goals and 
personality was corresponsive. 
5.3.1.5 Identity development principle 
Personality development is also counterbalanced by theories of continuity such as 
identity development, role continuity and genetic factors. Genetic factors are regarded as 
important influences on personality consistency (McGue et al., 1993; Roberts & Wood, 
2006). Research evidence suggest that  heritability coefficients  for personality traits using 
cross cultural research can reach approximately 50% for some of the Big Five (Munafo, 
2008). Longitudinal research using monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins shows 
that there are greater similarities in personality among MZ twins relative to DZ twins 
(Munafo, 2009). Research by Heath et al. (1994) supported a genetic link between harm 
avoidance, novelty seeking and reward dependence and the investigators found that 
genetics explained between 54 and 61 percent of stable variation in these traits. 
The identity development principle supports both continuity and change in 
personality (Roberts and Caspi, 2003). According to Marcia (1980, p.159) identity is 
understood ― as a self- structure – an internal self constructed, dynamic organization of 
drives, abilities, beliefs and individual history.‖ From the perspective of personality 
continuity, identity development is linked to personality consistency in a number of ways. 
Firstly, an individual‘s identity becomes known to others through reputation. If a person 
has a reputation for being extrovert, they may be invited to social gatherings because they 
are outgoing and engaging. Secondly, role identities, are both complex and differentiated 
(Roberts & Caspi, 2003). Differentiation refers to the number of role identities a person 
has. Complexity describes the set of identities, where individuals can obtain different 
needs and these identities can be tied to different domains such as work, family or friends. 
Complexity facilitates personality consistency by providing multiple outlets for the same 

 
115 
 
trait rather than just a single route .Thirdly, individuals commit to and maintain identities 
with age and identities support personality consistency by providing reference points  for 
making life decisions (Caspi et al., 2005). 
5.3.1.6 Role continuity and plasticity 
The role continuity principle suggests that personality becomes consistent because 
individuals occupy consistent environments. However, there is no empirical evidence 
supporting the idea (Roberts & Wood, 2006) as environments may be considered as 
physical or in a subjective manner. The plasticity principle suggests that personality is 
capable of change across the lifespan (Mroczek & Spiro, 2003; Trzesniewski et al., 2004; 
Mroczek et al., 2006). However, there are others who suggest that continuity is 
maintained through developing consistency in their thinking, patterns, activity profiles 
and social relationships over time which arise from an accumulation of experience that 
relies more on past experience (Atchley, 2006).  
Table 9 categorizes studies of change in personality and other constructs using the 
idealized approach to change developed by Lance et al (2000). The following studies are 
used as illustrations. In a study of young adults (Vaidya et al., 2008b) collected three 
waves of data at average age 18, 21 and 24 to examine continuity and change in 
personality. The study found that personality demonstrated rank order continuity across 
the three waves and growth modeling indicated participants showed mean level increases 
in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Openness and Agreeableness and the sample 
indicated a mean level decline in Neuroticism. The sample also showed interindividual 
differences in intraindividual change in the Big Five. Research conducted by Branje et al. 
(2007) examined changes in personality for adolescence and middle adulthood in 285 
Dutch families.

The findings highlighted that ―for boys, Extraversion and Openness decreased and for 
girls, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness increased. Whereas 
mothers‘ Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness increased, fathers‘ Extraversion, 
Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability decreased‖ (Branje et al., 2007, p.45).  
5.4 CHAPTER DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION 
 
In –house assumptions –continuity 
Researchers often conclude that change is not present with high to moderate test –
retest reliability (Prinzie & Dekovic, 2008). Researchers, (Fraley & Roberts, 2005; 
Roberts et al., 2006b; Fryer & Elliot, 2007; Prinzie & Dekovic, 2008) argue that a 
common mistake researchers conclude about differential continuity is that a construct 
does not change over time and that this conclusion is both premature and incorrect. 
Continuity and change can happen simultaneously and are independent (Block 1971, cited 
in Roberts et al. 2006). Retest correlations do not support change and continuity at the 
individual level of analysis and mask intraindividual variation in stability (Asendorpf, 
1992).  
An analysis of the different types of continuity and change using the ZTPI was 
presented in Table 5. It is clear that dispositional research on time perspective has 
demonstrated mean level change, structural continuity and differential continuity. There is 
an overreliance on differential continuity without placing it in the context of other 
approaches to continuity .Test –retest reliabilities after four week period (Zimbardo and 
Boyd, 1999) showed a value of .8 for future,.76 for present fatalistic, past positive .76, 
present hedonism .72 and past negative.70.  
 
Retest periods of four months used by Luyckx et al. (2010) indicate that the test 

 
119 
 
retest reliability for present hedonism is .68, present fatalism .58 and future time 
perspective .70. Test retest correlations using a two week interval for the scales used in a 
Lithuanian version: (Liniauskaité·& Kairys, 2009) showed future time perspective .89, 
past positive, .72, present fatalistic .89,present hedonism .83 and past negative .93. Retest 
correlations for the five scales in (Anagnostopoulos & Griva, 2011) ranged from .70-.80 
after a four week period.  
 
Mean level decline in future time perspective was demonstrated by (Holman & 
Silver, 2005) and in Luyckx et al. (2010), present fatalism and present hedonism  
demonstrated significant mean level decline while future time perspective indicated a 
significant mean increase over a four month period, despite showing statistically 
significant differential stability. The study of Holman and Silver (2005) used adults while 
Lukyxx et al. (2010) surveyed young adults at university. However, measurement 
invariance testing, using item parcels formed from the ZTPI scales, was conducted by 
Luyckx et al. (2010). Research on TP profiles mainly addresses approaches to calculating 
cutoffs for a balanced time perspective (Drake et al., 2008; Boniwell et al., 2010) rather 
than examining ipsative continuity.  
 
Paradigmatic and ideological assumptions. 
Paradigmatic assumptions underpinning the dispositional view of time perspective 
focus on differences rather than change. The two period design appears well embedded in 
the time perspective studies and these designs limit opportunities for the study of change 
and continuity because the design is uninformative about the shape of change and 
continuity beyond linearity (Rogosa, 1995). Critics of differential psychology (Lamiell, 
1981; Molenaar, 2004; Hamaker et al., 2005; Lamiell, 2007; Molenaar, 2007) suggest that 
correlational research provides information on between person relationships rather than 

 
120 
 
individuals. Time  
To understand change, a hybrid approach focuses  on the individual level and the 
group is proposed by Curran and Wirth, (2004) where we obtain idiographic and 
nomothetic information (Jones & Meredith, 1996). Idiographic information provides a 
picture of individual change while nomothetic information demonstrates change across all 
individuals (Lamiell, 2007). Time perspective researchers do not generally adopt 
multiwave designs to study continuity and change and there is an over reliance on 
temporally insensitive methods and designs which denies time its place in time 
perspective. Ideologically, it would appear that the preoccupation with continuity holds 
more kudos for time perspective given the lack of attention to change and the time 
intervals chosen in the establishment of continuity. Both in-house and paradigmatic 
assumptions have been challenged by a growing body of literature in personality 
development which highlights the lack of present theorizing about continuity and change 
in time perspective which constraints its study. 
Personality development  
Personality studies have moved from positions regarding it as purely trait like or as 
purely determined by context. There is broad recognition that personality develops. In the 
context of personality development across the lifespan, research studies have indicated 
that some people will demonstrate change in personality dimensions while others do not. 
Change and continuity in personality has been supported through studies using work, 
social investment, and plasticity where individuals have demonstrated interindividual 
differences in intra individual change over time, using current approaches to the study of 
change.   
It is clear that the current description of continuity or change in time perspective 
under present in-house assumptions is inadequate and problematization has shown that 

 
121 
 
continuity and change are multifaceted, multilevel and require different methodological 
approaches to show that continuity and change can co-exist and they are independent. 
Currently, researchers appear to have settled for a narrower view of continuity in time 
perspective and broader understanding of continuity and change is required and this 
objective is addressed by formulating a set of research questions that can move time 
perspective in a different direction. 
5.4.1 Research questions  
Given the significant lack of longitudinal studies on of continuity and change in time 
perspective, no formal hypotheses addressing the specific functional forms of change 
trajectories are suggested. Instead the following research questions are presented: 
1. Do time perspectives demonstrate differential continuity? 
 
 
2. Do time perspectives demonstrate mean level continuity and change?  
 
3. Do time perspectives demonstrate inter individual difference in intraindividual 
changein their time perspectives? 
4. Do individuals demonstrate reliable change in their time perspectives? 
 
 
 
5.4.2 Justification for research questions  
There is a virtual absence of empirical evidence examining change in time 
perspective. Anecdotal evidence taken from clinical settings shows that therapy alters 
time perspectives (Zimbardo et al., 2012). The objective of therapy in this setting is to 
reduce past negative and present fatalism and increase future time perspective, past 
positive and present hedonism to levels that provide improvements in well-being, 
functioning and which ameliorates PSTD symptoms. The evidence for change in time 
perspective claimed by Zimbardo et al. (2012) cannot tell us if time perspectives changed 

 
122 
 
slowly, if they changed at the same rate for all participants and which time perspectives 
were the least/most difficult to change. The authors do not discuss the shape of any 
change trajectory despite having longitudinal data. Present theorizing about continuity and 
change in time perspective is inadequate because researchers think mainly in terms of 
continuity and not change. 
Time perspective is regarded as a process, and psychological processes ―develop, 
change and evolve over time‖ (Pitariu & Ployhart, 2009, p.405). To study change over 
time, one should have a theory of change, an appropriate statistical model and a suitable 
temporal design (Collins & Graham, 2002; Collins, 2006). Personality development 
researchers have developed theoretical guidance on why personality demonstrates 
continuity and change, but such theorizing is not sufficiently developed in the 
dispositional view of time perspective. Clearly, these features are absent in time 
perspective research, however there is ample evidence of rank order continuity. 
Alternative perspectives, such as temporalism, critique differential thinking which is 
subsumed into current methodological decisions. Differential thinking does not lend itself 
to modeling and measurement in a temporalist sense because there is an over-reliance on 
variables to measure processes which does not describe what happens.Time perspective as 
a disposition addresses the conceptualization and measurement debate, but does not 
reflect a measure of time perspective that is sensitive to change. The question of 
individual change is an important one in that group level indices such as rank order 
stability can mask individual change. Latent growth models have become central to the 
study of individual change by describing change in terms of a trajectory. In this approach, 
a single trajectory is fitted to the sample. The latent growth model was developed within 
differential thinking and represents a top down rather than a bottom up description of 
change while the temporalist perspective begins with the trajectory and adopts a bottom 

 
123 
 
up approach. The research questions and methods address what is, rather than what 
happens, but this is an important first step in placing time perspective in a temporal 
research agenda by offering a critique of the way that time perspective is viewed by 
researchers. 
The guiding principle underpinning the present research is drawn from Baltes et al., 
(1980), who suggest that assumptions of trait like properties should be accompanied by an 
examination of intra individual variability and those issues of continuity and change must 
contain information on the average level of a construct and individual variability in the 
level of that construct. Questions of change and continuity are often raised against the 
background of little or no previous theory about individual change and in these cases, 
previous authors (Chan et al., 2000; Fryer & Elliot, 2007; Vaidya et al., 2008b) do not 
formulate hypothesis, but instead advocate a set of research questions.

CHAPTER 6 
RESEARCH PARADIGMS AND METHODS 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of the chapter is to outline the philosophical stance, research design and 
methods adopted and to detail the survey design and development procedures.  
The chapter is divided into three sections shown in Figure 10. Section one outlines the 
philosophical position and methods adopted in the research. Section two introduces the 
research design, its rationale and its advantages and disadvantages. Section three 
highlights the research strategy, method of data collection, the challenges of longitudinal 
research and the design and development of the research instrument. The chapter 
concludes by arguing for a longitudinal fixed occasion panel design where survey data are 
collected over three measurement occasions and analysed using a multimethod approach 
to answer the research questions.

6.1 RESEARCH PARADIGMS AND METHODS 
The aim of section one of chapter six is to present the choice of philosophical stance, 
epistemology and methods.  
6.1.1 Logical Positivism 
The philosophical position chosen is logical positivism, which guides research in the 
management and organizational field (Hunt, 1994; Chia, 1997; Johnson & Duberly 2000). 
Investigators undertake social science research within a set of paradigms. A paradigm ―is 
a set of propositions that explain how the world is perceived; it contains a world view, a 
way of breaking down the complexity of the real world, telling researchers and social 
scientists in general what is important, what is legitimate, and what is reasonable‖ (Patton, 
1990, p. 37).  
6.1.2 Epistemology- hypothetetico deductive approach 
The research strategy is based on deduction which is shown in Figure 11.

Ontological and epistemological assumptions inform the research strategy and the 
choice of methods adopted (Findlay & Lin, 1999). The epistemological and ontological 
tenets of logical positivism are outlined in Table 10.

6.1.3 Strategy of enquiry 
The thesis adopts quantitative methods to answer the research questions. 
Quantitative methods permit the researcher to understand social facts through observation 
and measurement (Firestone, 1987). Table 11 describes the process of quantitative 
research.

129 
 
Quantitative methods have strengths and weaknesses (Johnson et al., 2007). 
The strengths of quantitative methods include: testing and validating already constructed 
theories about how phenomena occur, generalizing a research finding when it has been 
replicated on many different populations and subpopulations, useful for obtaining data 
that allow quantitative predictions to be made, elimination of confounding relationships 
and research results are relatively independent of the researcher. 
The weaknesses of quantitative methods entail: the failure of constituents to 
understand categories created by the researcher, the generation of abstract knowledge 
which may not be directly applicable to settings or individuals and the researcher‘s 
preoccupation with hypothesis testing may blind them to alterative avenues of 
investigation.Researchers use a variety of quantitative methods to study time perspective 
such as correlation, regression and structural equation modeling. A review of the literature 
using the ZTPI identified 105 papers and book chapters. Out of the 105 studies, 91% were 
cross sectional, 2.8% were longitudinal and the remainder were theoretical papers. 
Seventy five percent adopted regression and correlation, 14% adopted CFA and SEM and 
the reminder adopted EFA, discriminant function analysis and cluster analysis. 
To summarize, the present research chose: the philosophical stance of logical 
positivism, a hypothetico-deductive approach and quantitative methods to answer the 
research questions. 
6.2 RESEARCH DESIGN 
The objective of section two of the chapter is to present and evaluate the research 
design. Section two of the chapter outlines and justifies the research design and presents 
the advantages and disadvantages of longitudinal designs. The philosophical position 
underpins the research design which is described as a ―plan that provides the underlying 

 
130 
 
structure to integrate all elements of a quantitative study so that the results are credible, 
free from bias, and maximally generalizable (Dannels, 2010,p. 343).  
A study‘s design can be considered using Catell's data box (Cattell, 1952). The data 
box is a three dimensional cube of persons, variables and occasions and it is a useful way 
for examining within and between person variation (Mroczek et al., 2003) and individual 
change. To answer the research questions, a prospective longitudinal panel design was 
chosen where the same individuals are followed across a set of measurement occasions, 
the same data are collected and relationships can be examined at the individual and the 
group level of analysis (Taris, 2000; Menard, 2002). The minimum requirement for a 
longitudinal design is three waves (Chan, 1998; Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010; Ployhart 
& Ward, 2011). 
6.2.1 Evaluation of and rationale for the chosen design 
Longitudinal designs have their advantages, disadvantages and challenges. The 
advantages include: the suitability of the design to study continuity and change at the 
group and individual level of analysis, longitudinal designs are central to decomposing 
rank order consistency into individual stability coefficients and examining changes in 
rank order continuity. The challenges include: attrition, deciding on the temporal design, 
missing data and panel conditioning. Disadvantages of longitudinal designs include 
additional financial costs and the requirement for more complex analysis. Table 12 
outlines the criteria used to guide the study‘s design. Table 12 is used to map the research 
problem to its theoretical drivers, design and methods and research questions. Figure 12 
situates the present study of continuity and change in time perspective within the temporal 
research agenda by emphasizing that continuity and change have different

interpretations depending on the unit of analysis.  
To summarize, section two of the chapter, continuity and change are part of the 
temporalist research agenda which requires multiwave designs. The design chosen in the 
present study is a three wave prospective longitudinal panel design spanning a 12 month 
period. The study of continuity and change is guided by a framework developed by 
Roberts et al. (2008), which guides the interpretation of continuity and change, and this 
framework emphasizes the choices of different quantitative approaches. The longitudinal 
research presents challenges which the design must manage, using the appropriate 
research strategy. The advantages and disadvantages of the statistical approaches chosen 
in Figure 12 are outlined in section three. 
6.3. RESEARCH STRATEGY CONTEXT AND 
METHODS  
The aim of section three is to outline the research strategy adopted to manage the 
challenges presented by longitudinal research, the statistical approaches adopted in the 
study, the research context and sampling choice.  
The research strategy adopted in the thesis is quantitative methods. However, a 
broader research strategy is outlined in section three that deals with some challenges of 
longitudinal research that impact the study of continuity and change. Section three 
outlines the research context and good practice guidance to aid the study‘s design, data 
collection, and strategies needed to manage the main challenges of longitudinal research.   
6.3.1 Research strategy: good practice  
The research strategy details how the data were collected and the approaches used to 
manage some of the main challenges posed by longitudinal research such as minimizing 
non response and attrition, dealing with missing data, the choice of temporal design and 

 
134 
 
choice of time metric. The good practice guidance highlights the key issues that should be 
considered in longitudinal designs examining individual change and continuity and they 
form the basis for methodological decisions made in the chapter.  
6.3.2 Research strategy: evaluation of data collection approaches  
Consistent with the objectives of longitudinal research and the research questions, 
data were collected using a panel design to study individual change over time (Firebuagh, 
1997). The measures used in the study were included in a paper based questionnaire 
utilizing previously validated self report measure.  
Surveys have a number of benefits and disadvantages (de Leeuw & Hox, 2008). The 
benefits include: an effective way of collecting good quality data when resources are 
limited, mail surveys are less intrusive which is vital in a panel design and surveys 
provide easier access to a large geographical area and larger samples (Bourque & Fielder, 
2003). Unfortunately mail surveys suffer from high levels of non-response and alternative 
ways of collecting data such as internet or mixed mode approaches were not considered 
for the following reasons: 
1 Respondents at the research sites had limited access to computers and declined to 
provide email addresses. 
2 Use of an internet survey could produce sample bias because views of the wider  
population who do not have access to internet are not be captured (Ilieva et al., 2002). 
3 The use of internet surveys would require individuals to have a username and 
password and respondents were reluctant to provide email addresses to which a 
password and username could be delivered. 
4 Splitting the sample into those that want a survey electronically and those who prefer a 
paper based copy introduces questions of measurement invariance. Tests of 
measurement invariance between the two modes need to be conducted before data  can 

 
135 
 
be combined to rule out measurement biases, and this activity adds additional levels of 
complexity to the analysis (De Beuckelaer & Lievens, 2009; de Leeuw & Hox, 2011).  
Longitudinal designs represent additional challenges such as: method variance, non-
response, missing data, temporal design and choice of time metric. It was decided to adopt 
good practice in the methods adopted in order to manage these challenges.  
6.3.3 Research strategy: method variance and panel conditioning 
To manage method variance, good practice advocates a temporal separation of 
measures, which is easily managed in longitudinal designs. To manage panel 
conditioning, it was decided to alter the structure of the survey on each measurement 
occasion. 
Surveys collect self-report measures, which have received some criticism due to the belief 
that such measures contain common method variance (Chan, 2009). Common method 
variance is described as variance that arises from the method by which data were 
collected rather than from the constructs under study (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Method 
effects may arise because of a common measurement context, a common item context, or 
from item characteristics themselves. Method effects are especially potent where data 
from predictor and criterion variable are measured from the same measurement context, 
using the same items. The temporal separation of measurement occasions helps to reduce 
the influence of responses, transient moods and response styles across data collection 
periods (Rindfleisch et al., 2008). However, concerns such as response bias and 
acquiescence may not be ameliorated by longitudinal research designs (Steenkamp and 
Baumgartner, 1998).   
Another challenge posed in longitudinal designs is panel conditioning or carryover 
effects. Panel conditioning may enhance the quality of responses at a later date (Lynn 
2010) and is considered to be a form of measurement error (Cantor, 2008). According to 

 
136 
 
Waterton and Lievesley (1989, cited in Cantor, 2008, p.123), panel conditioning occurs 
because changing behaviour or attitudes reflects more honest reporting of socially 
desirable behaviour and improved understanding of interviewing rules. The evidence for 
panel conditioning suggests that it is a function of the survey content and questions (Lynn, 
2010) but the evidence is mixed for attitudes, opinions and subjective reports (Cantor, 
2008). In their longitudinal study of parent control of subsidiaries, Selmer and deLeon 
(2002) cite Menard (1991), who suggests that to ameliorate against panel conditioning the 
structure of surveys should be altered in longitudinal studies. 
6.3.4 Research strategy: temporal design  
One very important aspect of the study of change and continuity is the temporal 
design (Collins & Graham, 2002; Collins, 2006). The temporal design refers to the timing 
and spacing of data collection and there is little guidance in the literature on the precise 
function of how slowly or quickly time perspective changes. The decision to use three 
measurement occasions over a 12 month period was based on theoretical and practical 
reasons. Firstly, three measurement occasions permit a more sophisticated description of 
individual change relative to a two period design (Willet, 1989; Singer and Willet, 2003; 
Duncan et al., 2006). The analysis adopts latent growth modeling which requires a 
minimum of three measurement occasions (Mroczek et al., 2006; Mroczek & Griffin, 
2006b; Byrne et al., 2008).The data collection interval ranged from September 2009- 
September 2010. 
Secondly, the temporal design raises questions about duration of the longitudinal 
study such that it is sufficient to capture the phenomenon of interest, and it attends to the 
interval between measurement occasions (Collins & Graham, 2002). The measurement 
occasions chosen in the study and its duration were based on existing literature. Previous 
research by Luyckx et al. (2010) found mean level changes in time perspective using two 

 
137 
 
measurement occasions separated by four months, and because time perspective is 
depicted as a disposition, any change over time may happen more slowly which requires 
wider time intervals.   
Wider spaced measurement occasions in excess of four months were not chosen 
because of concerns about attrition. It is advised in any longitudinal study to start with a 
large sample to offset the risk of attrition (Taris, 2000). Unfortunately in organizational 
research, large longitudinal samples are an exception rather than the rule. The choice of 
wider spaced intervals would have extended the duration of data collection, which raised 
concerns about risk of increased attrition (Taris, 2000). 
Practical considerations also shaped the choice of interval adopted in the study, such 
as a desire to avoid intrusiveness (Dillman, 2000). The choice of time interval attempted 
to achieve balance between answering the research questions and minimizing the risk of 
attrition. At the research site, it became apparent that respondents were tiring of 
completing the survey at round three. Attrition between time one and time three was 
approx. 16% of the sample, and contact with respondents after round three indicated that 
only 50% of sample were prepared to complete the fourth round survey. A decision was 
made not to proceed with the fourth round on the basis that it would not yield a reasonable 
sample size. Furthermore, the research context was also complicated by the demands of 
an organizational change programme which impacted the willingness of respondents to 
complete a fourth survey.  
6.3.5 Research strategy: measuring time 
The coding of time is an important decision in a latent growth model. 
Time was measured using the measurement occasion adopted in the study. Continuity and 
change are a feature of the time interval, measurement occasions and units of analysis 
chosen by the researcher. Data gathered from longitudinal designs are said to be time 

 
138 
 
structured (Block 1979, cited in Preacher et al., 2008, p.13) and there are a variety of 
ways in which time is coded (Little et al., 2006; McArdle, 2010). According to Grimm 
and Ram, (2012), time can be calibrated in different ways and these are shown in Table 
13.

Studies of individual change within organizational context (Lance & Vandenberg, 
2000; Chan & Schmitt, 2000; Bentein et al., 2005; Jokisaari & Nurmi, 2009) normally use 
measurement occasion as the time metric (Lance & Vandenberg, 2000; Chan & Schmitt, 
2000; Jokisaari and Nurmi, 2009). Researchers studying continuity and change in 
personality in adulthood have adopted the measurement occasion as the time metric or 
respondent age (Branje et al., 2004; Scollon & Diener, 2006; Vaidya et al., 2008b; 
Bleidorn et al., 2009).  

 
139 
 
6.3.6 Research strategy: managing non-response  
The approach adopted to manage non response was based on principles of survey 
design, tracking respondents, maintaining follow up and adopting a missing data strategy. 
The strategy adopted for managing non response draws on good practice in survey design 
and implementation advocated by numerous researchers (e.g. Dillman, 2000; de Leeuw et 
al., 2003; Boys et al., 2003; Lynn, 2008) such as adopting a user friendly design, 
providing advanced letters, written reminders, use of replacement questionnaire, provision 
of return addressed envelopes, maintaining appropriate length of the study to minimise 
attrition, presentation of the survey in booklet form, assuring confidentiality, gaining and 
maintaining access, implementation of the survey and using a system of checks and 
follow-ups with respondents.  
The non-response and attrition management process followed in the research is 
outlined in Figure 13 and is based on guidance from Boys et al. (2003, .p 367).  
Prior to survey administration, respondents were given advanced notice of the data 
collection schedule for the three rounds and in addition, a two week advance notice was 
sent advising respondents of the survey‘s arrival. Participants were given three weeks to 
return the survey. Respondents who did not return the survey after this time entered the 
non-response process and received two reminders followed by a phone call. Those who 
did not respond after three attempts to contact them were placed in the missing data 
process. These respondents were not supplied with any further surveys, but were 
contacted to ascertain their reasons for withdrawal from the study. The flow chart 
demonstrates the activities used to maximize responses and the role of statistical analysis. 
Respondents who failed to return the survey after the final attempt to contact them were 
placed in the statistical strategy for dealing with missing data which is detailed in chapter 
seven.

6.3.7 The research context and methods 
The population of interest are youth workers and boards of management who are 
contracted to train early school leavers within a network of training organizations across 
the Republic of Ireland. The research sites were selected because current research using 
the ZTPI relies disproportionally on university students and a longitudinal field study 
using working adults provides an advantage over existing studies.   
The research sites were chosen to maximize attitudinal diversity to time through 
geographical spread, as members of attitudinally congruent social networks are likely to 
resist attitude change relative to those in less attitudinally congruent settings (Visser & 
Mirabile, 2004).  
The network of training organizations was established in Ireland in the 1980‘s as a 
community based response to support early school leavers, and there are currently 39 
training organizations in existence. Youth workers and boards of management obtain 
funding on the basis of a business plan, which stipulates the achievement of learner 
outcomes. Youth workers train the early school leaver to develop a skill, place them on 
work experience and progress them to employment or further study.  
The task of training and placing early school leavers invokes a variety of time 
perspectives. Past negative can be invoked because of a bad experience with a learner, 
who caused embarrassment to a youth worker while on work experience. Past positive can 
emerge because an early school leaver who managed to gain employment and change 
their life visits a youth worker and they reminisce about old times.  Future time 
perspective is engaged when trying to place the learner in employment. Present fatalism 
manifests in the realization that no matter what you do as a youth worker, the learners will 
inevitably put short term distractions above long term achievement, and often to their own 
detriment.  It is in this context that the study of continuity and change in youth worker 

 
142 
 
time perspective is examined. 
6.3.8 Sampling 
Data were collected across three measurement occasions from a sample of youth 
workers using a network of 39 training organizations in the Republic of Ireland. The 
sampling approach adopted in the research is multistage sampling, which involves the 
selection of primary level units at stage one followed by sampling of lower level units  at 
stage two (Hox, 1995; Stapelton, 2010). A sampling frame of 39 research sites across the 
Irish Republic containing approx. 350 employees and 160 voluntary boards of 
management were selected. There was no sampling frame available for the individuals 
nested within the training companies.  
To build a sampling frame of individuals, the entire population of training companies 
was asked to participate in the study (N=39). The primary unit sampled was the training 
company and individuals within that company were the secondary unit. Training 
organizations received a letter and consent forms from the researcher asking them to 
support the study. The final sampling frame of individuals (N=130 individuals) was based 
on those who responded from companies with consent forms from 25 out of the 39 
training organizations. 
6.3.9 Design and development of the research instrument 
6.3.9.1 Time perspective measures 
Time perspective was measured using the Zimbardo and Boyd Time Perspective 
Index (1999) which is a 56 item scale. International investigations using the ZTPI have 
predominantly supported a five factor model in: Brazil (Milfont et al., 2008), Portugal 
(Ortuna & Gamboa, 2010), France (Apostolidis & Fieulaine, 2004), UK and Russia 
(Boniwell et al., 2010), Spain (Díaz-Morales, 2006), Lithuania (Liniauskaité·& Kairys, 

 
143 
 
2009) and the USA (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). Questionnaires were distributed to 
respondents across three measurement occasions. Research evidence suggests that 
response rates may be increased once questionnaire content is presented in a logical order 
relevant to the respondent (Roberson & Sundstrom, 1990). By presenting relevant items 
in a logical order, respondents are ―hooked into completing part of the questionnaire and 
he or she is more likely to finish and return it‖ (Roberson & Sundstrom, 1990, p.357). 
Based on concerns of panel conditioning, it was decided to scramble the survey questions 
on different occasions.  
6.3.9. 2 Rationale for the chosen measure, scale reliabilities and sample items  
The measure of time perspective was chosen because it has been used in over 105 
scientific papers and has undergone extensive revisions by the scale developers. The 
measure addresses the past, present and future time perspectives, is regarded as a valid 
and reliable measure and the scale has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties 
(Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). An important psychometric property is scale reliability which 
refers to ―the proportion of variance attributable to the true score of the latent 
variable, ‖(DeVellis, 2003, p. 27). The homogeneity of the items within a scale is known 
as internal consistency reliability and is measured using Cronbach‘s alpha (Schmitt, 
1996), and it is the most popular measure used in all studies using the ZTPI. Scale 
reliabilities from existing studies for the full version of the ZTPI, are shown inTable 14. 
Items on the ZTPI are scored according to a five point likert scale ranging from very 
uncharacteristic to very characteristic. Sample items from each of the ZTPI scales are 
shown inTable 15.

6.3.9.3 Pilot study 
Pretesting surveys is a vital first step prior to administration and it is used to 
ascertain if the questions work well (Hunt et al., 1982). Pretesting helps to identify 
problems with the: survey layout, formatting of the survey, sequence of questions and 

 
145 
 
difficulties with individual questions. In sum pretesting determines a questionnaire‘s 
effectiveness (Reynolds et al., 1993). Pretesting facilitates the refinement of the 
questionnaire design and identifies errors in the questions which are only apparent to the 
population concerned (Reynolds et al., 1993). There are a variety of ways to pre-test a 
questionnaire: (a) personal interviews, (b) telephone interviews and (c) mail self reports. 
The personal interview approach helps to identify respondents reactions to the survey first 
hand (Hunt et al., 1982). The survey respondent is encouraged to think aloud while 
completing the questionnaire which is followed by a debriefing of the respondents by the 
interviewer. The debriefing may occur in the presence of the interviewer or by phone. In 
the mail self-report approach, the respondent is asked to complete the questionnaire and 
provide written feedback to the investigator. The pre-test sample should be a close fit to 
the actual sample when pre-testing the questionnaire. Pre-test samples should generally be 
small ranging from 13- 30 (Hunt et al., 1982). 
The survey used in the research followed pre-testing guidance above. In total, 13 
people were used to pre-test the survey. These individuals were employed by a large 
training company, who had similar job responsibilities to those in the target population.  
Four individuals completed the survey and agreed to provide feedback by telephone and 
four agreed to complete the survey and provide written feedback. All respondents found 
the layout and structure of the survey to be satisfactory and completed it in 15-20 minutes.  
However, they expressed some concern with two items on the Zimbardo and Boyd time 
perspective index. The items included (1) ―Meeting tomorrow‘s deadline and doing other 
necessary work comes before tonight‘s play‖ and (2) ―It is more important for me to enjoy 
life‘s journey than to focus only on the destination.‖  After consultation, respondents 
expressed some confusion at the word ―play‖ in item (1) which was replaced by the word 
―entertainment.‖ The item was changed to read as follows ―Meeting tomorrow‘s deadline 

 
146 
 
and doing other necessary work comes before tonight‘s entertainment.‖ Respondents were 
also confused about the meaning of ―destination‖ in item (2). The word destination in the 
minds of pre-testers was not equated with outcomes and the word ―destination‖ was 
replaced with the words ―end result‖ so that the item read ―It is more important for me to 
enjoy life‘s journey than to focus only on the end result.‖ The remaining five pre-testers 
received the amended survey by post and they completed it in 15-20 minutes. These 
respondents did not report any additional problems with length, layout, structure, and 
survey items. Respondents were asked about whether they wanted to create a respondent 
I.D. from their personal details or be given one by the researcher. It was decided that the 
researcher should provide the I.D because individuals would either forget to write it in the 
survey or may not remember the I.D they created. 
6.4 Ethics, consent and access 
Prior to survey administration the questionnaire and research questions were 
submitted to Dublin City University‘s Research Ethics Committee. Attrition is a concern 
in longitudinal research and it was decided to offer a cash incentive to participants in the 
form of a 500 euro draw that would take place at the end of the data collection phase .The 
ethics committee did not approve the proposal for an incentive on the grounds that it may 
encourage individuals to participate in the study who might not ordinarily do so. The 
incentive was subsequently withdrawn prior to survey administration. A copy of the DCU 
Research Ethics Committee approval letter is in APPENDIX A. 
To access the research sites, a request was made to the Executive of the umbrella 
body of training organizations to support the research initiative in January 2009.  
Following agreement by the Executive in February 2009 to support the research, each 
training company manager and boards of management received a letter informing them 
about the research in March 2009. Each training centre usually holds a monthly board 

 
147 
 
meeting in which the request to participate in the research was raised. Consent forms were 
disseminated in April 2009 to give boards and managers sufficient time to consider the 
request. Consent forms took approximately 6-8 weeks to return. In September 2009, 130 
individuals from 25 out 39 training companies returned consent forms and agreed to 
participate in the study. Before sending out surveys, each respondent received an 
advanced letter indicating the schedule of data collection and key dates.  
 
6.5 Survey administration 
Following the return of the consent forms each respondent was allocated a unique 
identifier and a survey was posted. Surveys were sent by post to each participant between 
September 2009 and September 2010 using a four month window. After round one, two 
respondents out of the 130 were excluded from further measurement occasions because 
they had missing data on all ZTPI items in the first round and did not respond to the 
researchers attempts to contact them. On the first round of data collection each individual 
received a pack containing: a self-addressed envelope, a copy of the survey with a unique 
identifier and a cover letter. Respondents received follow up reminders two weeks after 
the survey was posted. The same administration process was followed in the second and 
third rounds of data collection. A spread sheet was used to track respondent replies and to 
manage non-response. Those who failed to return the survey received a reminder and a 
copy of the survey to complete and were subsequently followed up by phone. To assess 
systematic missing data across surveys, data were entered into SPSS following each round 
and a missing data report was created. The report checked for any survey items that were 
being omitted purposefully by the respondent or clusters of respondents within and across 
training organizations. A copy of the survey is in APPENDIX B. To prevent respondents 
from resubmitting a previous survey, the second and third round surveys were scrambled 

 
148 
 
and a time stamp was placed on all surveys at rounds one, two and three.  
To summarize, the ZTPI was chosen to measure time perspective, it outlined the 
sample scale reliabilities and sample items from the ZTPI, it discussed the ethical 
considerations raised and it presented the pilot testing procedure followed by a description 
of the survey administration process. Data were collected using a paper based survey 
which was posted to respondents. The survey was designed in booklet form and followed 
the principle of good design to obtain the maximum response rate, to minimise missing 
data, and to militate against panel conditioning (Dillman, 2000; de Leeuw & Hox, 2008; 
de Leeuw & Hox, 2011). Electronic copies were not designed because respondents at the 
research sites declined to provide email addresses to which a user name and password 
could be sent. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents across three measurement 
occasions. Research evidence suggests that response rates may be increased once 
questionnaire content is presented in a logical order relevant to the respondent (Roberson 
& Sundstrom, 1990). By presenting relevant items in a logical order, respondents are 
―hooked into completing part of the questionnaire and he or she is more likely to finish 
and return it‖ (Roberson & Sundstrom, 1990,p.357). Based on concerns of panel 
conditioning, it was decided to scramble the survey questions on different occasions.  
6.6 CHAPTER CONCLUSIONS 
 
The chapter presented the philosophical position taken, the associated design and the 
process of instrument development and testing. The philosophy of science guiding the 
research is logical empiricism and the research adopted quantitative methods to analyse 
survey data.  
To summarize, the study of continuity and change requires prospective longitudinal 

 
149 
 
design with a minimum of three waves. The study design was used to address panel 
conditioning and testing effects by altering the structure of the survey across different 
measurement occasions. The temporal separation of measurement occasions helps to 
reduce the influence of responses, transient moods and response styles across data 
collection periods (Rindfleisch et al., 2008). Non response was managed using a process 
that provided advanced notice, follow up and a series of contacts with respondents. The 
potential for missing data is managed through a follow up process with respondents and a 
statistical strategy. The temporal design and time intervals were chosen based on existing 
time perspective literature. The choice of a three month window was grounded in the view 
that time perspective would not demonstrate rapid mean level and individual change. The 
length of the study was based on practical reasons such as challenging times encountered 
at the research sites and concerns about attrition. 
Following ethics approval for the study a survey containing measures of 
demographics and time perspective was administered to a sample of 128 youth workers 
across three measurement occasions after pilot testing. Youth workers were sampled from 
a network of training organizations contracted to train early school leavers. Pilot testing 
revealed that respondents had some concerns with items on the ZTPI and these were 
corrected.  
The research questions and research design inform the choice of statistical 
approaches and the research design underpins the four quadrant diagram developed by 
Roberts et al. (2008) shown in Figure 12 which presents the different types of continuity 
and change. Continuity and change at the different units of analysis requires different 
statistical approaches. For example rank order continuity at the group level is assessed 
using a correlation coefficient, but retest correlations are not informative about individual 
stability. Mean level continuity can be assessed using repeated analysis of variance, but it 

 
150 
 
focuses on group level and not on the individual level. Latent growth modeling considers 
both the individual level and the group levels of analysis. Individual differences in change 
are also examined using the reliable change index which identifies those who changed and 
those who did not using two measurement occasions.

CHAPTER 7 
 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The purpose of the chapter is to present the statistical approaches adopted in the 
study to answer the research question, to analyze the data collected across three 
measurement occasions using good practice outlined in chapter six and to answer the 
research questions. The chapter layout is shown in Figure 14. 
The chapter is divided into three sections. Section one describes and critically evaluates 
the statistical approaches chosen. Section two presents data preparation and outlines 
adherence to distributional assumptions, managing missing data, outliers, floor and ceiling 
effects, testing for multilevel structure in the data arising from sampling process, and 
verifies the reliability of measures. Section three presents some preliminary descriptive 
statistics and the results of the study.

7.1 STATISTICAL APPROACHES ADOPTED IN THE 
RESEARCH  
7.1.1 Statistical approaches adopted in the research 
Continuity and change require longitudinal designs and the framework provided by 
Roberts et al. (2006) outlining the different conceptualizations of continuity and change 
directs attention to the choices of empirical approaches. The present research draws on a 
range of statistical analysis techniques to measure continuity and change such as: retest 
correlations to assess rank order continuity, RANOVA (Repeated Measures ANOVA) to 
examine mean level change, Latent Growth Models to investigate interindividual 
differences in intra individual change and the reliable change index to test for reliable 
individual differences in change over two periods. In addition to these approaches, the 
present study examines intraindividual variation in stability using a stability coefficient 
developed by Asendorpf, (1992). Figure 15 categorizes the statistical approaches adopted 
in the present research into trajectory based and non-trajectory based. Trajectory based 
approaches describe continuity and change in terms of a trajectory using means and 
variances such as a latent growth models. Trajectory based approaches examine continuity 
and change across multiple waves and fits a trajectory for the group and individual.  
7.1.1.1 Non trajectory: intraindividual stability coefficient  
Non trajectory based approaches describe continuity and change using a two period 
design i.e. they describe continuity and change from the first to second measurement 
occasions or from the first to the third. Retest correlations describe rank order consistency 
at the group level, but are not informative about continuity and change at the individual 
level. Non trajectory approaches for exploring continuity and change at the individual 
level include the reliable change index and intraindividual differences in stability. 

 
154 
 
Asendorpf (1992) demonstrates that despite moderate to high rank order consistency, 
individuals may demonstrate intraindividual variation in their stability coefficients.  
The decomposition of the re-test correlation into individual contributions can show 
individuals who retain high levels of individual continuity across measurement occasions 
and those that do not. By decomposing re-test correlations into individual contributions, a 
more informative description of continuity can be provided. The formula for decomposing 
a re-test correlation into individual stability coefficients (i12) is taken from (Asendorpf 
1992) and is shown in Equation1. 
Equation 1  i 12  =     1 –     (Z1-Z2)2 
 
    
 
   2           
 
where Z1 and Z2 are the standardized z scores corresponding to individuals scale score 
and i12 is the individual stability coefficient between time 1 and time 2.  
7.1.1.2 Non trajectory: Reliable change index 
The reliable change index is used extensively in clinical research and in studies of 
personality development. The index assesses the clinical significance of an intervention 
indicating that individuals moved from a dysfunctional to functional distributions. The 
concern about movement from a dysfunctional to a functional distributional is that it is 
clinically significant, but the measure of change can be unreliable (Jacobson, Follette, and 
Revenstorf 1984, cited in Wise, 2004, p. 52). The reliable change index has attempted to 
definitively indicate that reliable change has occurred by setting cutoffs for the index at 
+/_ 1.96 showing that change was reliable. The RCI has evolved to control for 
measurement error of pre test scores (Christensen & Mendoza 1986, cited inWise, 2004, 
p. 53). There are a variety of indices which measure reliable individual change such as the 
reliable change index (Wise, 2004), but the RCI chosen in the research is based on 

 
155 
 
Jacobson and Truax, (1991). The approach advocated by Jacobson and Traux is easy to 
use and has received support among personality researchers (Roberts et al., 2001; 
Donnellan et al., 2007; Ludtke et al., 2009).

and where here X1 and X2 are individual scale scores from different measurement 
occasions, where 𝑠1√1 −𝑟𝑥𝑥; indicates that s1 is standard deviation of a pre-treatment 
group, rxx is the test retest reliability of the measure administered at different occasions.  
 
Reliable change  indices were computed in excel using an RCI calculator (Zahra, 
2010). The calculator was tested using the example in Jacobson and Truax (1991).  The 

 
156 
 
index  is based on classical test theory (Robins et al., 2001), where index values greater 
than +1.96 and  smaller than -1.96 are indicative of reliable change at the individual level 
of analysis. Respondents are classified into the percentage of the sample demonstrating 
reliable change (increases or decreases) and percentage remaining the same. The 
statistical approaches adopted to answer the research questions are compared and 
contrasted in Table 16 which is based on Lance et al. (2000). 
7.1.1.3 Trajectory based approaches: Ranova and Latent Growth Models  
Table 16 presents an evaluation of the approaches used to examine continuity and change, 
and latent growth modeling represents a significant improvement over competing 
alternatives because it simultaneously considers both continuity and change at the group 
and individual levels of analysis (Curran et al., 2010). Repeated analysis of variance 
(RANOVA) is also a trajectory based approach but attends to the group level change or 
continuity. Regression based approaches such as (R)ANOVA require complete data. 
Latent growth models (LGM) have been instrumental in the study of continuity and 
change at the group and individual level (Mroczek et al., 2003; Mroczek & Spiro, 2003; 
Scollon & Diener, 2006; Mroczek & Griffin, 2006a; Mroczek et al., 2006; Branje et al., 
2007; Mroczek, 2007; Bleidorn et al., 2009; Mroczek et al., 2009).The specification of the 
Latent Growth Model, LGM is shown in Figure 16 and the model parameters for the 
LGM are shown in Table 17 and the structural equation modeling framework is shown in 
Figure 17 which guides estimation and testing.

Model specification involves the designation of variables, relations among the 
variables and the status of parameters in the model (Hoyle, 2012a).The growth model was 
specified in Figure 16 and Figure 17outlined the process for specification, estimation and 
testing of a Latent growth model. Model identification involves moving from ―known 
information to model parameters‖(Kenny & Milan 2012,p.145). An identified model 
means that there are unique values for the model parameters and that the number of 
known parameters is either equal to or exceeds the number of unknown parameters 
(Hoyle, 2012b). Model identification is considered in the context of model constraints. In 
the specification of the LGM in Figure 16, the time metric is constrained to be equal to 
specific values to model linear change and the specification assumed is that error 
variances are uncorrelated.  
Model estimation involves obtaining estimates of unknown parameters by 
minimising the discrepancy between the sample covariance matrix and a model implied 
covariance matrix (Lei & Wu, 2012). Maximum likelihood estimation uses an iterative 
process to minimize the discrepancy between the sample variances and covariance and the 
model implied variances and covariance using convergence criteria. The LGM uses 
Maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the model parameters when data are normally 
distributed. After estimation and assuming no improper solutions or out of range values, 
the model is examined for fit using fit statistics and fit indices. The assessment of fit and 
theoretical considerations prompt development of alternative models such as using 
different time metrics or including residual patterns. Finally, results of each model are 
reported and the appropriate model is chosen. 
To summarize, the research questions and research design inform the choice of 
statistical approaches and the research design underpins the four quadrant diagram 
developed by Roberts et al. (2008) shown in Figure 12 which presents the different types 

 
162 
 
of continuity and change. Continuity and change at the different units of analysis requires 
different statistical approaches. For example rank order continuity at the group level is 
assessed using a correlation coefficient, but retest correlations are not informative about 
individual stability. Mean level continuity can be assessed using repeated analysis of 
variance, but it focuses on group level and not on the individual level. Latent growth 
modeling considers both the individual level and the group levels of analysis. Individual 
differences in change are also examined using the reliable change index which identifies 
those who changed and those who did not using two measurement occasions. The 
limitations of these approaches are outlined in chapter nine.

7.2 DATA PREPARATION 
Section two presents the treatment of data, coding, multivariate outliers, and 
distributional assumptions, missing data, testing for multilevel structure, floor and ceiling 
effects and attrition. 
7.2.1 Data coding 
Data were pre-processed in SPSS version 20 and MPLUS v7 was used to conduct 
the latent growth models and tests of multilevel structure. Following data entry, a random 
sample of 40 surveys was taken for each measurement occasion to check for data entry 
errors. Errors were found in data entry and all surveys across the three rounds were 
rechecked and the errors were corrected. Missing data were coded using minus 999 and 
negatively worded items were reversed scored according to Zimbardo and Boyd (2010). 
Sample items included: if things don't get done on time I don't worry about it, I take each 
day as it is rather than plan it out, there will always be time to catch up on my work, the 
past has too many unpleasant memories that I prefer not to think about, and I find myself 
tuning out when family members talk about how things used to be.  
7.2.2 Multivariate outliers   
Outliers are observations that have a unique combination of characteristics which 
makes them different from other observations (Hair et al., 2006). Data were checked for 
multivariate outliers using Mahalobis Distance D2 in SPSS. Higher values of D2 indicate 
the presence of multivariate outliers. The largest D2 was 13.59 with two independent 
variables which is less than the critical value of 13.82 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). It was 
decided that multivariate outliers were not a cause for concern.  
7.2.3 Distributional assumptions 
Structural equation modeling requires that observed variables follow multivariate 

 
164 
 
and univariate normal distributions (Curran et al., 1996). There is some debate about the 
cut offs regarding non-normality (West et al., 1995) and, in general, standardized kurtosis 
ranges from +/-2 (Muthén & Kaplan, 1985) to +/- 7 (West et al., 1995) which indicate 
departures from non-normality. Individual survey items were not normally distributed. 
One solution to non-normality is to use the scale scores from each time perspective 
(Byrne, 2012) and this was adopted in the research. Table 18 reports the univariate 
skewness and kurtosis for each of the time perspective scales obtained from MPLUS 
version 7 and these do not indicate departures from normality that may raise concerns.

7.2.4 Multilevel structure   
The sampling approach adopted in the research is multistage sampling which 
involves the selection of primary units (organizations) at stage one followed by sampling 
of lower level units (individuals) at stage two (Hox, 1995; Stapelton, 2010). Multistage 
sampling was chosen because the primary unit sampled was the organization and the 
second stage of sampling used individuals. This sampling approach gives rise to nested 
data i.e. individuals nested within organizations.  
Multistage sampling gives rise to a hierarchically structured data set and implies that 
observations are not identically distributed and independent (Kaplan & Elliott, 1997) and 
so estimated model parameters such as standard errors tend to be small, yielding 
spuriously significant results (Hox, 1995). The independence assumption is violated 
because responses from the same group are more similar than observations from different 
groups and the lack of independence can be demonstrated using an intraclass correlation 
(Hox, 1995). Ignoring a multilevel data structure can present problems such as negatively 
biased standard errors which results in spurious effects (Hox & Maas, 2004). Testing of 
multilevel structure was handled in MPLUS 7 by estimating a series of multilevel latent 
growth models and examining the intraclass correlations. 
The approach adopted in MPLUS is to handle three levels of analysis using a two 
level approach. Time is included in the level one model, individual is at level two, and 
cluster is the third level (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2010). The task is to decide if variance 
in time perspective measures arises from clustering in which case a multilevel analysis is 
required. The intraclass correlation (ICC) measures the amount of variability that can be 
accounted for by clustering (Hox, 2010). Although there are conflicting cutoffs for (ICC), 
(ICCs) close to zero indicate that it is pointless to model a multilevel structure in the data 
(Byrne, 2012). In research conducted by Julian (2001) multilevel data structure with 

 
166 
 
minimal intraclass correlations produced relatively unbiased chi square test statistics, 
model parameters and standard errors. To exclude multilevel structure intra class 
correlations were generated in MPLUS for each of the time perspectives. Intra class 
correlations ranged from .004 to .042 for the five time perspectives which would indicate 
that a multilevel model is inappropriate and analysis should proceed using conventional 
SEM approaches (Julian, 2001). It was decided not to pursue a multilevel analysis based 
on the intraclass correlation. 
7.2.5 Floor and ceiling effects 
Floor and ceiling effects refer to extreme scores on a test and are likely to occur with 
older individuals (Andresen et al., 1998; Andresen et al., 1999). Ceiling effects refer to 
situations where test participants reach the highest possible score on the test and ceiling 
effects are known to produce spurious relations in growth models (Lijuan et al., 2008). 
Scales were judged to have floor and ceiling effects if  20% of respondents had the 
highest or lowest score on each of the scales (Andresen et al., 1998). Data did not exhibit 
floor and ceiling effects, and this analysis is presented in Table 19.  
7.2.6 Missing data analysis 
The sample of 130 respondents gathered contained two individuals with missing data 
on all time perspective measures. It was decided to drop these individuals from the 
remaining measurement occasions because they failed to complete the time perspective 
measures and did not complete the second and third wave of measurement. The effective 
sample size after round one was 128 individuals. Missing data are defined as a ―statistical 
difficulty ( i.e. a partially incomplete data matrix) resulting from a decision by one or 
more sampled individuals to not respond to a survey or a survey item,‖ (Newman 2009,p. 
8).

Data may be missing at the item level on a survey, at a scale level, at the survey level 
or at a wave or measurement occasion level according to different missingness processes 
(de Leeuw et al., 2003). Missing data are a fact of life for any researcher, especially for 
longitudinal research and it can limit the generalizability of research findings (McKnight 
et al., 2007) and the statistical power of the analysis is reduced because of a smaller pool 
of items, (Newman 2009). A smaller sample size can make the sample less representative 
of the population (Boys et al., 2003) and it can inflate type I and II error rates (Roth, 
1994; Collins et al., 2001) and bias parameters estimates such as correlation coefficients 
(Roth, 1994). Given the seriousness of missing data, a strategy is required to retain as 
many participants and responses across the study which must be supported by an 
appropriate statistical response.  
7.2.6.1 Reporting missing data 
The non-response and attrition management process was previously outlined in 
Figure 13 and was adapted from (Boys et al., 2003, p.367). Respondents who failed to 
return the survey after the final attempt to contact them were placed in the statistical 
strategy for dealing with missing data. The statistical strategy adopted to manage missing 
data is to first examine missing data patterns, assumptions and then implement 
appropriate solutions.  
There is no inherently correct methodological procedure for handling missing data 
(Enders, 2010). Missing data are treated according to guidelines presented in Bodner, 
(2006), Schlomer et al. (2010) and Enders, (2010). The following guidelines were used to 
manage missing data. Missing data reporting should include an acknowledgement of 
missing data, the range of missing data per scale, attrition analysis, differences between 
stayers and leavers, reports of attrition at each wave and over all attrition, a decision on 
the missing data mechanism, a presentation of missing data with scale reliability and the 

 
169 
 
approach used to handle missing data should be discussed. Table 20 reports the 
percentage of missing data.

In total, missing data on each time perspective scale ranges from approximately 24 % to 
25% across all waves which arose from sample attrition. 
7.2.6.2 Missing data mechanism 
To propose a solution to missing data, a missing data mechanism must be identified. 
Missing data mechanisms describe the missingness in three ways: missing completely at 
random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR). Data 
can be missing according to these classifications  on the variable, individual and occasion 
levels (McKnight et al., 2007) and the authors provide a description of each of the 
mechanisms. Missing completely at random refers to missing data that arises because 
respondents randomly omit responses, or respondent data is missing at random or a 
respondent fails to show up at a data collection session.  
Data missing according to MAR at the item level means that missing data may be 
linked to other responses on the respondent level where missing data may be linked to 

 
170 
 
demographics at the respondent and at the occasion level. MAR may arise on one 
occasion because of poor performance on a prior occasion. Missing not at random at the 
item level can arise because a person refuses to answer incriminating items, at the variable 
level. MNAR arises because missing data is related to unmeasured demographic data, and 
MNAR at the occasion level occurs because respondents refuse to participate in the study 
as a direct result of the study. Missing completely at random is testable while MAR and 
MNAR are not directly testable. A test of MCAR was conducted in SPSS 20 and Table 21 
indicates that data are missing completely at random. The results are based on item level 
analysis.

Following the confirmation of the missing data mechanism, it is recommended to 
examine the data for correlates of missingness which include demographic factors (Lance 
and Vandenberg, 2000). Variance tables can be used to identify correlates of missing data 
by conducting individual t-tests between observed variables, but the more tests conducted 
can result in Type1 errors (Enders 2011). Instead of variance tests, logistic regression 
analysis was conducted to identify the correlates of attrition (Given et al., 1985). Attrition 
was chosen as the dependent variable and it was coded as 0 for no attrition and 1 for 
attrition. Independent variables included age, gender; organizational role, education and 

 
171 
 
the time perspective scale scores for time one. The analysis indicated that the full model 
containing all predictors was not statistically significant 2 (6, N=127) = 8.02, p= .23.  
 
In longitudinal research, for MCAR to hold, observed data must be unrelated to 
scores on previous occasions and unrelated to missing data (Enders, 2011). In longitudinal 
studies, attrition is usually MAR in that missing scores in one measurement occasion are 
correlated with their observed scores on a previous occasions (Newman 2009). The MAR 
assumption allows attrition to depend on the responses at any or all occasions prior to 
dropout (Schafer and Graham, 2002).  In this case, respondents with incomplete data 
differ from participants with missing data, but the missingness is a function of  other 
observed variables in the data set (Bennett, 2001).  
Missing data mechanisms such as MAR and MNAR are not testable (Bennett, 2001) 
and deciding between MAR and MNAR is a process of judgment between theory and 
empirical approaches (Sterner, 2011). Data that are MNAR are related to missing values 
of the observed variables themselves. Two approaches are outlined in the literature, for 
dealing with MAR and MNAR; double sampling and statistical models such as pattern 
mixture models and selection models. Schafer (1997, cited in McKight 2007) suggests 
that double sampling be used to ascertain the reasons for missing data. 
Double sampling involves collecting additional information from non-respondents 
through follow up. Respondents who left the study were subsequently followed up and 
were asked if: the survey was difficult for them to understand, the survey questions 
prompted them to leave the study and whether other reasons impacted their decision not 
to respond. Individuals who left the study did so for different reasons such as retirement, 
job change, maternity leave and career break. Missing data is regarded as ignorable if the 
mechanism that created the missing data is either random or the reasons for missing data 
are given in double sampling (McKnight et al., 2007). Schafer (1997) questions the 

 
172 
 
tenability of MAR if there is no evidence of follow up for non-respondents.  
7.2.6.3 Attrition by gender 
Cross tabulation between attrition and gender was conducted to test for a relationship 
between attrition and gender. Attrition was coded as 1 for attrition and 0 for no attrition. 
Cross tabulation shows that 21 individuals left the study of which 9 were females and 12 
were males. A chi square test for independence (with Yates correction) showed no 
significant association between gender and attrition across the three waves,2 (1, N= 
128) =.30, p= .57, phi=.7  
7.2.6.4 Attrition by measurement occasion  
A two-way Anova was used to analyse mean differences between stayers and 
leavers. To examine the impact of attrition on each of the time perspective scales, 
participant status was coded into three groups as follows: 1= participants who completed 
all three waves, (n=107 or 83.59%), 2= those who completed T1 and T2 but not T3 (n=11 
or 8.4%) and 3= participants who completed T1 but not T2 and not T3, (n=10  or 7.8%). 
(Vaidya et al., 2008b). The dependent variable entered was the time perspective scale 
score for the first measurement occasion (Lance & Vandenberg, 2000). The ANOVA 
indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between stayers and 
leavers for future time perspective F(2,125)=.421,p=.63, eta2=.007, present hedonism 
F(2,125)=1.55,p=0.21 eta2=.024, present fatalism, F(2,125)=.045.p=0.95,eta2=.001, past 
positive F(2,125)=.922,p=.40, eta2=.01 and past negative F(2,125)=0.96,p=.38, eta2= .015.  
The solutions for missing data under MCAR is to choose between traditional approaches 
such as case wise deletion or more state of the art approaches such as imputation and full 
information maximum likelihood (Schafer & Graham, 2002). Maximum likelihood 
estimation was chosen because it uses all available data and traditional approaches to 

 
173 
 
handling missing data are flawed (Enders, 2010). The alternative state of the art approach 
is multiple imputation which was not used because it produces the same results as 
Maximum likelihood (C.Enders, personal communication, February 15 2012). 
7.2.6.5 Establishing the validity and reliability of the measures 
Internal consistency reliability is concerned with item homogeneity within a scale 
and is demonstrated through high item intercorrelations (DeVellis, 2003). Construct 
validity considers the extent to which a measurement instrument measures a latent 
construct that it was designed to measure in the first place (Raykov & Marcoulides, 2011). 
Cronbach‘s alpha is a standard indicator of internal consistency, which reflects the 
proportion of a scale‘s total variance, which can be attributed to a common source. 
Construct validity is normally examined through confirmatory factor analysis. Table 22 
presents Cronbach‘s alpha for each of the time perspective scales across the three time 
periods. 
Assessment of construct validity normally proceeds with confirmatory factor analysis to 
examine the factor structure and factor loadings of the measures. Confirmatory factor 
analysis posed difficulties which invoked a number of judgment calls (McGrath, 1982) 
where the researcher must choose between a lesser among evils. The relatively small 
sample size (N=128) posed some challenges and was handled using three approaches in 
the literature.  
7.2.6.6 Confirmatory factor analysis 
The first option is to estimate a CFA for all five time perspectives using all items 
which uses a higher number of indicators per factor to compensate for smaller sample 
sizes (Marsh et al., 1998; Marsh & Hau, 1999). A second approach suggests trimming the 
number of indicators for established scales and a third option is to estimate a single factor 

 
174 
 
models for each time perspective.

Given the sample size of 128, and that there are 168 items across three occasions, 
MPLUS could not estimate a CFA for the five time perspectives simultaneously because 
the model would not converge on a set of model parameters.  
Option two  
Run CFA with a reduced number of items per factor. In this case scales may be 
refined using rules of thumb such as adopting a cut off of .5 and cross loading of .25 
based on (Bartel& Milliken, 2004) and scale reliabilities are shown in Table 23 for the 
time perspective measures when the rule of thumb is applied. Measure refinement ―refers 
to any set of procedures performed on an instrument designed to improve its 
representation of a construct‖ (Smith & McCarthy, 1995,p. 301). The scales were 

 
175 
 
shortened using the guidance provided in Bartel and Milliken (2004) but yielded 
unsatisfactory scale reliabilities shown in Table 23. The approach presents other concerns 
such as production of highly redundant items, low numbers of items and potentially low 
validity (Boyle 1991 cited in Stanton et al., 2002) and difficulties with consistent factor 
structure (Catell 1978 cited in Stanton et al., 2002).

The use of any modified scale should be tested on an independent sample and 
examined for discriminant validity (Smith & McCarthy, 1995). Finally, any attempt to 
reduce the number of items on the ZTPI has led to poor psychometric properties 
(Wakefield et al., 2010). It was decided not to proceed with the alternative on the grounds 
of poor reliability and validity concerns because the modified scales were not pretested in 
their modified state. This option was not pursued further.  
Option three 
Conduct CFA with smaller sample sizes using one factor models and all scale items. 
Rather than reduce the number of items, it was decided to run a set of individual CFAs. A 
CFA was chosen over EFA because the factor structure of the ZTPI is well established. 
Missing data was handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML), which is 
superior to approaches such as case wise deletion (Enders & Bandalos, 2001). The results 
of each of the CFAs are shown in Table 24. Given that high reliability is a condition for 
validity (Raykov, 2004); the decision was taken not to shorten the scale for CFA on the 
grounds that any comparison between research using a reduced scale and a full scale is 
problematic (Stanton et al., 2002). The results have implications for structural continuity 
identified in the framework developed by Roberts et al (2008). The impact of this decision 
is that invariance testing was not conducted in the analysis which is essential for any 
discussion of continuity and change (Golembiewski et al., 1976) and the assumption of 
invariance in measurement and factor structure was made. 
 
Table 24 indicates that three of the time perspectives demonstrated significant chi 
square tests: present hedonism, past negative and past positive. Cut offs for the various fit 
indices  are based on Hu and Bentler (1999), where CFI at .95 or above is considered as a 
good fitting model , SRMR close to 0.8 and RMSEA close to .06 are considered as well 
fitting models. The fit indices show mixed results. The fit of present fatalism and future 

 
177 
 
time perspectives appears satisfactory using the chi square test. The results are not 
surprising as previous validation studies have also shown significant poor fit using both 
chi square test and fit indices.

Instead of modelling the latent variables for each time perspective, the average of the 
scale items was used to measure the observed variables using a first order latent growth 
model (Byrne, 2012). The option to examine method variance longitudinally by adding 
correlated residuals or a method factor was also ruled out because it added even more 
parametres to be estimated relative to a basic CFA. 
To summarize, the section indicated that data met distributional assumptions 
appropriate to the techniques adopted.  It was decided to retain as much of the sample as 
possible and 128 cases were used. Attrition resulted in loss of 16.4% of the sample and 
there were no statistically significant differences between completers and non-completers 
across the three measurement occasions, and there were no gender differences in attrition. 
The missing data strategy adopted helped to prevent additional attrition and reasons 
for attrition indicated that they were unrelated to the study. Time perspective scales 
demonstrated reliabilities consistent with current literature and CFAs conducted in the 

 
178 
 
extant literature indicated poor fit to the data. The sample of 128 individuals did not 
permit invariance testing to be carried out using the entire set of scale items. Attempts to 
shorten the scales using factor loadings at .5 and above and cross loadings less than .25 
yielded unsatisfactory scale reliabilities and this procedure was not adopted. Therefore the 
assumption of invariance was made across measurement occasions.  
7.3 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  
The purpose of section three is to describe the sample characteristics, report correlations 
between measures and to provide answers to the research questions. 
7.3.1 Sample characteristics  
Table 25 presents sample statistic and indicates that the average age of males was 
higher than females and males had longer organizational tenure than females. The average 
age for males in the sample is 47 and 42 for females, and both males and females have 
worked in the organizations sampled for approximately 8 years. Females showed 
marginally higher scores on present fatalism, past positive and past negative time 
perspectives relative to males. 
 A series of cross sectional independent sample t-tests were conducted to examine 
gender differences in time perspectives. Females showed higher mean levels of present 
fatalism at across all waves: T1 females (M=2.57, SD=.49, N= 65) relative to males (M 
=2.19, SD=.60.,N=63), t (126)=3.92, p<.001 two tailed test , T2: females (M= 2.62, 
SD=.57, N=60) relative to males (M =2.49, SD=.57.,N=60), t (115)= 3.39, p=.001 two 
tailed test and at T3, females maintained their higher scores on present fatalism (M= 2.55, 
SD=.53.,N=57 ) relative to males (M =2.25, SD=49.,N=51), t (106)= 3.01, p=.003 two 
tailed test. Two way ANOVAS were conducted to examine relationships with age, 
education level and organizational role, but there were no significant differences

between age categories and any of the time perspectives.  
The analysis revealed the presence of role differences on present fatalism where 
instructor roles showed higher levels of present fatalism relative managerial roles  F 
(3,121)= 2.74, p=.046, eta2 = .064. The findings relating gender to time perspective are 
not unique and are supported by results from Corral-Verdugo (2006). The correlation 
matrix, shown in Table 26 indicates that future and present fatalism are negatively related, 
present hedonism and present fatalism are positively related, past positive and present 
hedonism shows a positive relationship and past negative and present fatalism are 
positively related. Organizational tenure was omitted because it was unrelated to any of 
the time perspectives. Longitudinal Pearson correlations indicate a statistically significant 
and negative relationship between past positive and age. By way of commentary, the 
relationship between age and time perspectives is not a surprising finding. The time 
perspective literature indicates that the relationship between age and time perspective 
demonstrates mixed results (Mello & Worrell, 2006; Milfont et al., 2008).

7.3.3 Do time perspectives demonstrate differential continuity? 
The results of differential and mean level continuity are shown in Table 27. The table 
indicates that retest correlations are statistically significant, but different from unity. All 
time perspectives demonstrate rank order continuity, but past negative and present 
fatalism demonstrate the lowest retest correlations from the first to the third measurement 
occasions. Retest correlations for each time perspective were examined for changes in 
rank order consistency across time (Vaidya et al., 2008a). It appears that time perspective 
scales show declines in rank order consistency from T1-T3, but this decline using the 
Williams modification of the Hotelling test did not indicate statistically significant 
differences in rank order consistency for each time perspective. 
Retest correlations were decomposed into individual stability coefficients using 
Asendorpf (1992) to examine individual variation in stability between the first and last 
measurement occasions. The stability coefficients show the individual contribution to the 
group level retest correlation. The analysis indicated that 50% of the sample had stability 
coefficients of .8 and above for each of the time perspectives. Intraindividual stability 
coefficients have a ceiling of one, but may also be negative (J.Asendorpf, personal comm
unication, August 16 2012) and negative stability coefficients were rounded to zero for 
ease of interpretation (A.Terraciano personal communication, February 2013). The vast 
majority of individual stability coefficients cluster near one.  
These stability coefficients are presented in Figure 18 for all individuals in the 
sample. The five graphs show the decomposition of retest correlations into individual 
stability coefficients to show the variation in individual stability between the first and 
third measurement occasions. Given consistently moderate retest correlations for each of 
the time perspectives, there is obvious intraindividual variation in stability across the five 
time perspectives.

sample. The coefficients are measured on the vertical axis and age is on the horizontal 
axis.

7.3.4 Do time perspectives demonstrate mean level continuity? 
A one way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine time effects across 
the five time perspectives using a Bonferoni correction to control for Type1 errors. The 
results indicate that there was no time effect for future time perspective across waves of 
measurement, wilks lambda =.99 F (2,104) =.53, p=.58, present hedonism walks lambda 
= .98 F (2,105), p =.35, present fatalism wilks lambda = .98 F (2,105), p=. 35, past 
positive wilks lambda =.98, F (2,105), p=.37, and past negative, wilks lambda = .98 F 
(2,105), p=.35. Furthermore, there were no gender or age effects found in the five time 
perspectives across the three measurement occasions.  
7.3.5 Do individuals demonstrate interindividual differences in 
intraindividual change in their time perspectives? 
Given three time points, a series of linear growth models were conducted to examine 
time perspectives for interindividual differences in intraindividual change using MPLUS 
version 7. The parameters of interest in latent growth models are the intercept and slope 
means, variances and the covariance between the intercept and slope, which describe the 
growth trajectories (Preacher, 2010). The growth models were estimated and tested 
according to the flow chart presented in Figure 17. All growth models were estimated 
using maximum likelihood estimation which is considered to be a state of the art approach 
to handling missing data (Enders, 2010). 
 
An LGM for each time perspective was estimated beginning with an intercept and 
slope and if this model did not fit the data, an intercept only model was considered. The 
intercept only model is nested within the LGM described by an intercept and slope 
parameter (Duncan et al., 1999). The two factor model (intercept and slope) demonstrated 
that the slope factor and its variance, and the covariance between the intercept and slope 

 
186 
 
were not statistically significant. In the interest of parsimony, a set of single factor models 
or intercept only model were tested in MPLUS 7 for all time perspectives. The 
unstandardized results are presented in Table 28 which shows the intercept only models 
for each time perspective. The growth models indicate that intercept mean and variance 
were statistically significant showing interindividual differences around the intercept 
parametre. The MPLUS code for each model is shown in APPENDIX C.  
The intercept only model estimates two parametres of interest: mean (η01), variance 
(ζα). The intercept represents the mean score for all individuals across the three time 
points; the intercept variance quantifies the deviation of individual scores from the mean 
score at each time point. Growth curve analysis did not support the research question 
pertaining to interindividual difference in intraindividual change in any of the five time 
perspectives. These growth trajectories indicate that individuals have different intercepts 
and that growth curves demonstrate strict stability i.e. individual growth trajectories are 
parallel (Duncan et al., 1999). The intercept only growth model describes growth that is 
flat with respect to time (Curran et al., 2010). Figures 19-23 show trajectories for time 
perspectives that indicate strict stability.  
7.3.6 Do individuals demonstrate individual differences in change? 
Growth models are used to fit a single trajectory across a number of measurement 
occasions, but are not informative about individual change between time periods. 
Another approach to study individual change is to use the reliable change index (Jacobson 
and Truax, 1991). The reliable change index RCI has been used extensively in studies 
examining continuity and change in personality (Maassen, 2000; Roberts et al., 2001; 
Robins et al., 2001; De Fruyt et al., 2006; Donnellan et al., 2007; Blonigen et al., 2008; 
Lackenhoff et al., 2008).

Although the RCIs in Table 29 indicate reliable change, the concern is that reliable change 
may have arisen by chance, and a chi square test was used to test this hypothesis that 
reliable change did not occur by chance (Roberts et al., 2001). A chi squared test found 
that three out of the five time perspectives demonstrated reliable change beyond chance, 
namely present hedonism, present fatalism and past positive. Gender differences were 
investigated in reliable change using the crosstab function in SPSS. Reliable change was 
recoded to 0 for change and 1 for no change and there were no significant differences 
between the proportion of males and females who demonstrated reliable change.   
7.3.7 Correlates of individual change.  
Correlational analysis was conducted using the absolute values of the RCI from time1 to 
time 2 for each time perspectives (Fryer & Elliot, 2007). Pearson correlations indicated 
that organizational tenure was positively correlated with the RCI for future time 

 
194 
 
perspective (.204, p<0.05) and the RCI for past positive t1-t2 (.229, p <0.05). 
Surprisingly, age and gender were uncorrelated with individual change across the five 
time perspectives. A summary of the study‘s results is shown in Table 30. 
7.4 CHAPTER CONCLUSIONS 
 
The chapter presented an evaluation of the statistical chosen, data analysis and 
results. The statistical approaches are based on the conceptualization of continuity and 
change presented in Figure 14. To examine rank order continuity, retest correlations were 
chosen, but this analysis was supplemented with an evaluation of individual stability 
coefficients. Mean level continuity and change used RANOVA and Latent growth 
modeling and the assessment of individual differences in change used the Reliable 
Change Index. 
Data analysis revealed that: data were corrected for non normality through item 
parceling, data did not demonstrate floor and ceiling effects, a multilevel structure, there 
were no multivariate outliers, data were missing completely at random, however the 
assumption of MAR was made. There were no differences between stayers and leavers on 
any of the time perspective scales, and there were no gender differences in attrition. To 
deal with missing data it was decided to use the FIML estimation to estimate growth 
model parametres and obtain means and correlations. The results support the view that 
time perspectives demonstrates both continuity and change in an adult sample and results 
of the study are shown in Table 30. 
Time perspectives demonstrated rank order consistency, intraindividual variation in 
individual stability coefficients, mean level continuity in all time perspectives, there were 
no interindividual differences in intra individual change, however individual differences 
in change were evidenced across the five time perspectives using the RCI.

CHAPTER 8 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The purpose of chapter eight is to discuss the findings presented in chapter seven. 
The chapter follows the flow chart in Figure 24. The chapter is divided into three sections. 
Section one provides a summary of the research problem and results which are discussed 
in the context of the literature review. Section two discusses continuity and change in time 
perspectives in the context of similar findings in personality and goal mastery. Section 
three uses the results to combine the lenses of problematization and temporalism to 
critique existing time perspective literature using a positioning matrix which classifies 
existing time perspective research and provides direction for future research opportunities. 
Chapter eight concludes with a summary of the key findings.

8.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
Section one of the chapter summarizes the rationale for the research problem, 
restates the research questions and reviews the current findings in relation to the literature. 
The research agenda in organizations has highlighted the importance of continuity and 
change. This important theme has been investigated more thoroughly by personality 
development researchers, who have developed theories outlining when and why 
personality develops using the maturity and social investment principles. Presently, there 
is a significant lack of research examining continuity and change in the dispositional view 
of time perspective, which is hampering the field, and this study addresses the 
shortcoming. The shortcoming is addressed by questioning the unidimensional 
understanding of continuity among time perspective researchers by placing time 
perspective within a multilevel and multifaceted understanding of continuity and change. 
Within this framework, time perspectives demonstrated both continuity and change. 
Continuity and change are time related debates which challenge the research community 
to update its extant knowledge of a field so that theory remains valid and relevant (Roe, 
2008). The co-existence of continuity and change also raises opportunities to theorize 
about the reasons for continuity and change Roberts et al. (2008). 
The purpose of the research is to focus on these central themes of continuity and 
change in time perspective. Time perspective as a theory reflects the relationship among 
constructs which are bounded by constraints and assumptions, and these assumptions 
must be understood (Bacharach, 1989). In the tradition of individual differences, temporal 
consistency is denoted by retest correlations while change is described through 
differences in means across time (Pullmann et al., 2006). In this research tradition, time 
perspective adopts a trait like conceptualization where it is considered stable or not 

 
199 
 
(Watson, 2004). Currently, the conceptualization of time perspective as a stable individual 
difference is often understood to imply something that is enduring and fixed but this is a 
misleading interpretation (Fraley & Roberts, 2005; Roberts et al., 2006b).  
The present study drew upon a typology developed within personality development 
to clarify this assumption. The typology indicates that time perspective can demonstrate 
both continuity and change at the group and individual level of analysis. The rationale for 
this view suggests that continuity and change are multifaceted and the presence of one 
form of continuity does not preclude others. A multilevel perspective provides a more 
comprehensive picture of continuity and change in time perspective because it highlights 
that individual differences in change that may occur despite the presence of mean level 
and rank order consistency.  
To examine continuity and change in time perspective, data were collected from a 
sample of 128 youth workers using a longitudinal design. The research sought to 
investigate continuity and change in time perspective using the following research 
questions. Research questions were chosen because of the marked absence of prior theory 
underpinning continuity and change in time perspective.

 8.2 CONTINUITY AND CHANGE  
The purpose of section two is to contextualize the findings using the literatures cited 
to guide the research presented in the study‘s introduction.  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 25 Situating the study’s findings 
  
Figure 25 shows that the study of continuity and change in time perspective was 
driven by a set of diverse literatures. Currently, in organizational theory there are calls for 
research on time and the research agenda has suggested the study of continuity and change. 
Time perspective was situated in this arena and problematized using personality 
development literature. The main concern of the study was to highlight the inadequate 
conceptualization of continuity and change in time perspective. The inadequacy was 
demonstrated by positioning the time perspective within a personality development 
framework to show that it provides a more thorough and broader conceptualization than just 
rank order continuity to show that interpretations of continuity and change are varied and 

 
201 
 
multilevel. The framework helps to challenge in-house, paradigmatic and ideological 
assumptions that the presence of temporal consistency rules out alternative forms of 
continuity and change. The typology echoes Baltes et al. (1980) who suggest that 
assumptions of trait like properties should be accompanied by an examination of intra 
individual variability and that issues of continuity and change must contain information on 
the average level of a construct and individual variability in the level of that construct.  
8.2.1. Rank order continuity 
Change and continuity can be examined at the level of the individual and group, and 
change is defined as an absence of continuity (Caspi, 1998). Differential continuity 
represents the level of rank order consistency and describes the retention of an individual‘s 
relative placement in a group (Roberts & Del Vecchio, 2000). The retest correlations in the 
present study were smaller relative to the current literature. Table 31 demonstrates the 
means and retest correlations for each of the time perspectives. In a validation study 
including older adults Liniauskaité & Kairys (2009) demonstrated that retest correlations 
were in the range of .72 to .93 for the five time perspectives. The retest interval for these 
studies was 14 days. Given the range of retest intervals adopted in time perspective research, 
the nearest comparison can be found in (Luyckx et al., 2010) who used a four month interval 
in their two wave study.  
Retest correlations in the current study for present fatalism, future, and present 
hedonism ranged from .58 to .70. Present fatalism in the present research shows the lowest 
retest correlation and this is consistent with previous literature. The declining retest 
correlations in the present research reflect the wider retest intervals adopted in the study 
(Watson, 2004). It is likely that rank order continuity was maintained because the vast 
majority of individual level stability coefficients showed high levels of stability.

8.2.2 Mean level continuity in time perspective  
Mean level change describes the extent to which the average amount of the construct  
changes over time within a population (Trzesniewski et al., 2004; Fryer & Elliot, 2007) 
and is equated with normative change (Ludtke et al., 2009). Normative change suggests 
that people show the same changes during a specific time in the life span and are thought 
to occur from maturational or historical processes shared by a population (Helson and 
Moane 1997, cited in Roberts & Wood, 2006,p.20). Mean level continuity was supported 
in the study; however, the research by Luyckx et al. (2010) found mean level change in 
three time perspectives among their sample of students. 
Mean level continuity may have arisen in the present study because the net effect of 
increases and decreases of individual scores produced no significant mean level change 
(Vaidya et al., 2008a). Secondly, individuals were sampled from what might be 

 
203 
 
considered as a homogenous social context, in which they have similar temporal attitudes, 
and congruent attitudes are more resistant to change (Visser & Mirabile, 2004). However, 
individuals were drawn from different organizations separated by geographic location. 
Personality researchers indicate that transitions to adulthood show both continuity 
and change in personality dimensions (Roberts et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2006b; Watson 
and Humrichouse, 2006; Roberts and Mroczek, 2008; Vaidya et al., 2008a). The context 
for change in Luyckx et al. (2010) is based on young adults in a college environment who 
were shaping their identities for adult life. The reasons cited for the mean level change in 
Luyckx et al. (2010) include identity development and preparation for the future. The 
study focused exclusively on group level measures of continuity and change and did not 
examine individual measures. It would be tempting to conclude that the dispositional view 
of time perspective follows some type of developmental age graded trajectory similar to 
that found by personality development researchers (Mroczek and Spiro, 2003; Mroczek et 
al., 2006; Roberts and Mroczek, 2008), however, the lack of this type of research hinders 
our understanding of long term continuity and change in each of the time perspectives.  
The thesis research indicates that adults did not demonstrate mean level change and 
they retained rank order consistency, but retest correlations differed from unity. The 
average age of respondents in the present study was 44 years (SD=10.3). Life span 
development research examines continuity and change across the lifespan and suggests 
that we are always capable of change because individuals adapt with age to overcome the 
losses associated with aging (Baltes, 1987). The central tenet of life span development is 
the plasticity principle and previous work in personality suggests that traits are open to 
influence of the environment at any age (Roberts et al., 2008). Life span development 
researchers argue that individuals are described in terms of demonstrating both continuity 
and change in personal attributes (Nesselroade & Ram, 2004) and the results are 

 
204 
 
consistent with this interpretation. 
The prevalence of continuity in the sample may be explained using Continuity 
theory (Atchley, 2006) which argues that individuals retain consistency in their thinking 
patterns, activity profiles and social relationships over time. Individuals throughout life 
build up experience which they use to make decisions and the more they rely on past 
experiences the greater the probability of continuity. Given that the age of respondents in 
Luyckx et al. (2010) was 18.2 years, one would expect that students would not have 
accumulated a significant amount of life experience, which could be used to make 
decisions unlike the working adult sample studied in the research. If analysis in the 
present research focused purely on group level indices one may conclude that that the 
sample of respondents in the study do not demonstrate change. Group level indices such 
as means and correlations may not indicate change because the proportion of individuals 
increase in the attribute is offset by those who decrease in that attribute (Roberts et al., 
2001). Secondly, researchers may not observe change because they use reliable measures 
that are designed to capture differences between people and not measure change.  
8.2.3 Interindividual differences intraindividual in change time perspectives  
Latent growth modeling was used to examine the sample for interindividual 
differences in intra individual change. The findings supported an intercept only model 
which suggests strict stability and reflects individual growth curves that are largely 
parallel and this finding is consistent with a trait conceptualization of a construct 
(Partridge and Lerner, 2007). 
8.2.4 Individual differences in change in time perspective  
Individuals demonstrated reliable change across all time perspectives, and they also 
demonstrated intraindividual variation in stability. Reliable change for each of the five 

 
205 
 
time perspectives is shown is Table 32. The RCI has been used in studies of personality 
development, clinical and education settings and is potentially beneficial to non-
intervention contexts (Roberts et al., 2001). Personality development literature highlights 
that the absence of mean level change was accompanied by similar individual level 
findings (Vaidya et al., 2008a) and the present findings concur with previous research. 
The vast majority of individuals demonstrated continuity, but there is also evidence of 
change. Despite the evidence for the coexistence of continuity and change, individuals 
demonstrated more continuity than change.  
The percentage of those who did not demonstrate individual change ranges from 
80%-92% which indicates a remarkable level of continuity over the period. Although 
group level measures indicate continuity in the sample, the reliable change index showed 
that individuals demonstrated reliable change across all time perspectives that cannot be 
attributed to the unreliability of time perspective measures. The results imply that over a 
period of one year, time perspectives can demonstrate reliable change. Individual change 
may occur despite differential and mean level continuity and is gauged by the reliable 
change index (Jacobson & Truax, 1991).The RCI has been used in studies of personality 
development, clinical and education settings and is potentially beneficial to non-
intervention contexts (Roberts et al., 2001).  
Personality development literature highlights that the absence of mean level change 
was accompanied by similar individual level findings (Vaidya et al., 2008a) and the 
present findings concur with previous research. Time perspective research remains largely 
silent on the coexistence of continuity and change.

To contextualize the study‘s research findings, a brief overview in personality 
development and dispositional approaches to goal mastery are outlined in Table 33. 
The table indicates that goal mastery shows both mean level change and reliable change at 
most young ages and over much shorter time intervals.  
Personality dimensions have shown both mean level change and reliable change at 
different ages, but the study lengths have ranged between two and six years. Time 
perspectives in the current investigation have shown no mean level change, however, they 
show reliable individual change over a period of twelve months. The table also reflects 
the extent to which time perspective researchers think in terms of continuity, and cross 
sectional designs. The debate has lingered off mainstream despite becoming a significant 
area of research among dispositional and personality researchers (Fryer & Elliot, 2007; 
Muis & Edwards, 2009). Personality development research provides a more robust 
description of continuity and change relative to the dispositional view of time perspective. 
Personality development has helped to clarify that continuity and change coexist rather 
than being mutually exclusive.  

 
207 
 
Continuity and change are time related debates and they are important because 
researchers are unaware of the duration of stability and they have implicitly ruled out the 
opportunity for change. Furthermore, blindly accepting rank order consistency can hide 
intraindividual variation in stability.

Currently, time perspective researchers view continuity and change as mutually exclusive, 
thereby retaining a view that has been contradicted in a broader literature and these 
findings have implications for time perspective interventions. The findings prompt 
discussion on the assumptions behind the dispositional view of time perspective, and this 
is done through the lenses of problematization and temporalism in section three. 
 

 
208 
 
8.2.5 Ipsative continuity  
Although ipsative continuity was not directly addressed, it deserves some discussion. 
Ipsative continuity is concerned with the profile of time perspectives at the individual 
level of analysis. It is a person–oriented approach which describes the level of stability 
and change in the ordering of dimensions within the individual (De Fruyt et al., 2006).  
Ipsative continuity and change can be described in terms of: the score level, the profile 
pattern and the variability of the profile scores (Fryer & Elliot, 2007). The advantages of 
ipsative continuity and change are as follows: ipsative continuity and change can be 
predicted by other individual level constructs such as personality. The approach provides 
a description of those who changed and those individuals that did not which may help 
inform our understanding of the processes of stability and change. Thirdly, ipsative 
continuity and change consider a profile of each factor score within a person rather than a 
single dimension across individuals which is central to temporal research. Ipsative change 
is only relative to the individual being studied rather than attending to individual 
differences (Roberts et al. 2001). The ipsative approach to continuity and change may 
provide insights into a balanced time perspective at the individual level of analysis rather 
than drawing on the BTP from an individual differences perspective.  
Ipsative continuity and change may be more suitable to changing time perspectives 
based a coaching intervention where profile change for each individual can be discussed 
rather than drawing comparisons against the group. A limitation of ipsative continuity and 
change is that individuals cannot be directly compared to other test takers and the test is 
presented in a forced choice format rather than using likert scales.  Ipsative continuity and 
change reflect a person oriented approach which is side-lined by the current 
preoccupation with variable centred approaches in research that uses the ZTPI. The 
approach is also limited in that it does not permit a critique of rank order continuity which 

 
209 
 
is an individual differences index. The assumption made by researchers using rank order 
continuity is that little between person variation is presumed to indicate stability, but the 
absence of variation is not applicable to within person stability. The ipsative approach 
does not allow a rank order consistency to be decomposed into its within person 
components and despite rank order consistency, individuals can demonstrate 
intraindividual variation in their stability coefficients. 
 
8.2.6 Role of operating environment  
The findings support stability of time perspectives in general which may have arisen from 
a relatively stable operating environment over the data collection period. The research 
context is naturally a stable setting and training organizations are unionized. The lack of 
environmental stressors within the organizations may have contributed to the lack of 
change in time perspectives. Toward the latter end of 2010, Government cutbacks began 
to push a cultural change from social inclusion toward value for money. A steady state 
factor that may have suppressed individual change is the extent to which the funding body 
buffered the training organizations against the impact of cutbacks and change. After the 
data collection period it is possible that there was greater instability in the external 
operating environment which may have promoted change in time perspectives.  
 
8.3 TEMPORAL RESEARCH AGENDA AND BARRIERS    
The objective of this section is to show that the findings have implications for the 
dispositional view of time perspective. The current research agenda within organizations 
calls for greater temporal research and it highlights the research barriers. The research 
findings are used to highlight the link between variance and process thinking in the time 

 
210 
 
perspective literature while problematization is used to highlight that continuing to 
maintain consensus about the validity status does not bode well for process thinking.  A 
positioning matrix which describes the present state of time perspective is shown in 
Figure 26 and it is developed from the study‘s results. Although the study‘s findings are 
based on a variance approach, they can be used to highlight opportunities for process 
thinking (Van de Ven, 2007).  
 
8.3.1 Positioning Matrix  
The approach to time perspective as a disposition advocated by Zimbardo and Boyd 
(1999) has grown substantially since 1999. An evaluation of this literature using existing 
conversations, (Huff 1999, cited in Corley & Gioia, 2011), and variance and process  
epistemologies is shown in Fig 26, which highlights that time perspective literature can be 
categorized according to individual differences, rhetoric, long term stability and change 
and unfolding time perspectives. The positioning matrix is built on the assumption that 
variance approaches can be used to inform process thinking. 
8.3.1.1 Variance and Existing-Individual differences  
The vast majority of research using the dispositional view of time perspective falls 
into the category of individual differences i.e. continuity. In this category, research effort 
is spent on finding another outcome, antecedent, mediator and moderator. Research 
progressing along this line does not explain continuity and change in time perspectives. 
The category advocates an incremental approach to the growth of time perspective 
literature through gap spotting, which fails to challenge prevailing assumptions (Alvesson 
& Sandberg, 2011).

New lines of research in the existing and variance category arise through neglect 
spotting and application spotting. Neglect spotting can occur through identifying under 
researched areas, application spotting and identification of literature that lacks empirical 
support (Sandberg & Alvesson, 2011). The most popular approach to extending time 
perspective research is application spotting where researchers spot an important role for 
time perspective which has been previously ignored.  
8.3.1.2 Existing and Process -Rhetoric 
Existing conversations about change are mainly rhetoric. The rhetoric quadrant 
raises concerns  because variables are used to measure process, which was criticised by 
Roe et al. (2012) on the grounds of methodological misfit. Research in this quadrant 
argues for adaptability of time perspective using the balanced time perspective. The 
importance of reducing past negative and present fatalism to low levels is an important 
feature of intervention research (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Examples of rhetoric include

212 
 
discussions about creating a balanced time perspective to improve well-being and mental 
health. Currently, temporal therapy falls into this category, where changes in time 
perspective are discussed in terms of variables which do not show how therapy allows 
time perspective changes to unfold over time. 
The balanced time perspective is a case in point which is essential to optimal 
functioning (Zimbardo & Boniwell, 2004), but time perspective researchers do not know 
the required adjustment in time perspectives to produce an improvement in well-being, 
the pace of improvement and the shape of improvement. In effect, this research indicates 
current thinking rather than reflecting current practice and Roe et al. (2012) made the 
same observation in relation to the study of team processes. The dispositional view of 
time perspective is conceptualized as a process that partitions our experience into 
categories of past, present and future and continued emphasis on variance approaches has 
resulted in a significant body of timeless research which tells us little of how time 
perspectives unfold in the context of our life experience. 
The individual difference category is situated within research paradigms that show 
technological certainty i.e. there is agreement that certain methods and research questions 
will advance the field (Pfeffer, 1993) and research in this category will not challenge that 
status quo. Research in the individual differences and rhetoric categories depends heavily 
on variance epistemology which cannot explain how time perspectives demonstrate 
continuity and change.  
8.3.1.3 Variance and New – longer term stability and change  
New conversations push the research agenda toward process and variance thinking.  
Researchers are unclear about continuity and change in time perspective across the life 
span. Personality development research shows that personality increases in rank order 
consistency with age (Roberts & Del Vecchio, 2000) and shows normative change in early 

 
213 
 
adult hood (Roberts et al., 2001), adulthood (Helson et al., 2002) and even into old age 
(Mroczek & Spiro, 2003). Currently, researchers have no knowledge of continuity and 
change in time perspective across longer time intervals or if change is possible in shorter 
intervals. These observations are central to developing temporal knowledge about time 
perspective such as when it changes and what predicts those changes.  
Under variance models, the principles of personality development may open new 
conversations in continuity and change in time perspective by advancing other aspects of 
the temporal research agenda such as temporal relationships and dynamic relationships.   
For example, the maturity principle states that people become more socially dominant, 
agreeable, and conscientious and emotionally stable with age between 18-26 (Roberts et 
al., 2001). Research conducted by Dunkel and Weber (2010) shows that time perspectives 
correlate with the Big Five. Maturity is used to explain personality consistency and so it 
may be hypothesised that the maturity principle explains continuity and change in time 
perspectives. Current methodological developments in multivariate latent growth models 
may be used to investigate these avenues. 
Variance approaches might be used to develop process thinking with time 
perspective interventions. For example, variance models have shown that past negative 
and present fatalism time perspectives are positively related to suicidal ideation (Laghi et 
al., 2009). Unfortunately, time perspective research cannot explain how the emergence or 
growth in present fatalism and past negative are related to the emergence and growth of 
suicidal thoughts which has implications for intervention.  
8.3.1.4 New and Process –Unfolding time perspectives 
Process thinking may benefit early school leavers by investigating the intention to 
leave school early through connections with different unfolding processes such as the 
intention to leave school, a decline in commitment to school and classes of time 

 
214 
 
perspective. The intention to leave school early may be led by becoming uncommitted to 
school and a decrease in future time perspective, increases in present fatalism and past 
negative.  Research which shows time perspective and school commitment changes may 
act as an early warning system. More recent state measures of time perspective developed 
by Worrell and Mello (2009) yielded six time perspectives including a future negative 
time perspective which might focus on a relationship between future negative and the 
intention to leave school early.  
Process research will require: the conceptualization of a pathway to show how time 
perspective evolves, a new measure of time perspective that captures a pattern and a new 
temporal design to collect data at the desired intervals. In Solinger et al. (2013) the 
authors examined newcomer organizational commitment using graphic trajectories that 
could be displayed on a computer screen. Respondents created their own commitment 
trajectories using fast capture measure of organizational commitment with self anchoring 
scales ranging from 0-100. The approach allowed respondents to create their own 
unfolding graphical descriptions of their organizational commitment. These developments 
arising from the research findings face barriers because they challenge present thinking.  
8.3.1.5 Problematization -Barriers to process thinking  
The findings have implications for the broader way in which time perspective 
research is evolving. The problematization of the time perspective showed the role of in-
house, paradigmatic and ideological assumptions. In-house assumptions reflect the 
primacy of rank order continuity as the main indicator of stability, paradigmatic 
assumptions highlighted that the role of present research is to legitimize consensus about 
the validity status of time perspective as a disposition (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and 
ideological assumptions indicate that establishing continuity is preferred by and large to 
examining change.  

 
215 
 
Building consensus about the validity of the five time perspectives has occurred 
through gap spotting which reinforces the consensus and does not question underlying 
assumptions, and gap spotting reinforces an accumulation norm which does not encourage 
scepticism (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2013). Gap spotting has not resulted in any new 
theoretical developments which shows when time perspectives change, what factors 
support and inhibit change and the duration of continuity i.e. gap spotting is contributing 
to a mind-set that is oblivious to process approaches. Time perspectives can predict a 
variety of outcomes and behaviours such as risky driving, addiction and suicidal ideation 
but unless scholars have gained temporal knowledge of time perspective by describing it 
in terms of a trajectory, time perspective research will remain timeless. 
8.4 Practical applications  
8.4.1 Intervention  
The practical implications of this research attend to time perspective interventions where 
it would be important to reduce the levels of present fatalism among female instructors.  
Present fatalism is negatively related to academic outcomes and should be monitored. 
Unlike current research, the findings suggest that time perspectives are adaptable at the 
individual level of analysis. Given the clientele that attend the training organization, it 
would be incumbent on managers to ensure that levels of present fatalism do not increase 
to levels which may impact educational outcomes. Interventions addressing present 
fatalism require that we are aware that present fatalism trajectories may show 
improvement, bifurcation and relapse (Roe, 2008).   
8.4.2 Recruitment of instructors  
It is also important that for new instructors starting in training organizations that the right 
balance of time perspectives are maintained. Increasing levels of present fatalism may not 

 
216 
 
be conducive to becoming and insider and remaining with a training organization. Recent 
research on becoming uncommitted to an organization may want to consider time 
perspective in relation to on boarding scenarios (Solinger et al., 2013). The findings of the 
present study alert us to the need for time perspective to engage with the radical 
temporalist view so that time perspective remains relevant to the early school leaver 
settings by being captured as a process rather than by static categories which indicate 
general tendencies.  
 
8.5 Contribution-Theoretical and Methodological implications 
The study represents a contribution to the literature in the following ways. 
 The research has addressed a much overlooked theme of continuity and change in 
time perspective. The research findings show that time perspectives can 
demonstrate plasticity in an adult sample. The study‘s findings question the 
continued preoccupation with bolstering the validity status of time perspective as a 
disposition. 
 The findings question the trait like interpretation of time perspective by showing 
that time perspectives can demonstrate individual differences in change.  
 The research challenged the assumption that rank order consistency is interpreted 
as the main indicator of continuity and despite rank order consistency; individuals 
demonstrate intraindividual variation in their stability coefficients. 
 Thirdly, the investigation brings time perspective in line with personality 
development literature and achievement goal stability studies which demonstrate 
that continuity and change are multilevel and coterminous. 
 Methodologically, the study provides a more rigorous approach to continuity and 

 
217 
 
change using a variety of different methods. 
 The study is a longitudinal field study which represents a departure from the 
traditional two period designs adopted by time perspective researchers who make 
extensive use of university students.  
 The plasticity of time perspective shows that time perspectives are adaptable over 
a number of weeks and this finding suggests a role for time perspective 
interventions. 
8.6 CHAPTER CONCLUSIONS 
 
The chapter presented the study‘s findings and placed them in the context of existing 
literature. The main finding is that the research supports the coexistence of continuity and 
change in time perspectives which are supported from literature in personality 
development and dispositional approaches to goal mastery. The results were used to create 
a framework which indicates that time perspective as a disposition is heavily invested in a 
static view of time perspective despite the rhetoric of change. Continuity and change are 
temporal debates, but there is little time in time perspective. The research finding suggest 
a new conversation for time perspective using process thinking and reflects an initial 
starting point from which to address the temporal research agenda. 

 
218 
 
CHAPTER 9  
CONCLUSIONS  
 
The rationale for conducting the study is based on extending the temporal research 
agenda by examining continuity and change in time perspective. The present research 
chose the themes of continuity and change in time perspective because this theme is under 
researched given developments in closely related fields such as personality and 
dispositional views of goal achievement. 
The commonly held view among time perspective researchers is that time 
perspective does not change when temporal consistency is established. This claim is 
justified on the following grounds: the vast majority of studies using time perspective are 
cross sectional and these designs are uninformative about continuity and change, 
validation studies appear to follow the same retest intervals outlined in the existing 
literature and the obvious lack of longitudinal studies investigating continuity and change 
in time perspective is obvious. 
Recent research in personality development has challenged the one-dimensional 
view of stability, vis a vis rank order consistency and provides a more rigorous approach 
to understanding continuity and change. The present research initiated a new conversation 
about long term continuity and change in time perspective, a time related individual 
difference using the framework presented in Roberts et al. (2008). Consistent with this 
framework, time perspective was subjected to a more thorough analysis of continuity and 
change relative to the extant literature. The research sought to discover the coexistence of 
continuity and change in the dispositional view of time perspective using the following 

 
219 
 
research questions. 
1. Do time perspectives demonstrate differential continuity? 
 
Supported 
2. Do time perspectives demonstrate mean level continuity? 
 
Supported 
3. Do individuals demonstrate interindividual differences in  
intraindividual change in their time perspectives?  
 
 
Unsupported 
4. Do individuals demonstrate individual change? 
 
 
Supported 
 
All research questions were answered. No time perspective demonstrated mean level 
change and all time perspectives demonstrated differential continuity. There was no 
evidence to support interindividual differences in intraindividual change. However, 
individuals demonstrated individual differences in change using the reliable change index 
and they demonstrated intraindividual variation in stability. 
The research findings suggest that the preoccupation with consensus about the 
validity status of theory is concerning because it encourages researchers to take a 
unidimensional view of continuity or to consider that continuity and change are mutually 
exclusive. The research findings suggest that time perspective research should direct 
effort to new theory development which further explores continuity and change. The 
preference for continuity over change needs to be challenged because it distracts from 
important research avenues, such as intervention. Current literature shows relationships 
between time perspective and important health, psychological and academic outcomes 
and time perspectives may need adaptation through intervention. The research findings 
support the view that time perspectives are adaptable which makes them an ideal 
candidate for intervention to reduce past negative, present fatalism and improve future 
and past positive perspectives.

9.1 Limitations 
The study has a number of limitations in the areas of methodology and research 
design.  
1. Attrition is a concern among longitudinal research and it was decided to base the 
study on a potential pool of 400 respondents across different training organizations. The 
study‘s research design intended to financially incentivize respondents via a 500 euro 
prize in a draw. Dublin City University Research Ethics Committee raised an ethical 
objection to the participant incentive on the grounds that the incentive may unduly 
influence a participant‘s response, and that financial remuneration may encourage people 
to participate in the study who would not otherwise do so. 
The sample size limited the research because it did not support invariance testing 
across time periods to establish configural and metric invariance and it limited the method 
variance analysis. To manage method variance, the survey items were scrambled on each 
measurement occasion. To conduct invariance testing, refinement of the measurement 
instrument was considered. Refinement of measures refers to the application of a set of 
procedures to improve or modify the representation of a construct (Smith & McCarthy 
1995). When measures are refined, they should be retested in an independent sample and 
discriminant validity should be re-examined (Smith & McCarthy, 1995).The option to 
modify (reduce) the number of scale items by using cutoffs for factor loadings, at .5 and 
above with cross loadings less than .25, was considered, but this approach was rejected 
because of guidance and concerns provided in Stanton et al. (2002). The implication of 
this decision is that the findings may have arisen in part from beta and gamma change 
(Golembiewski et al., 1976) and that the assumption of invariance was made rather than 
supported empirically.  
2.  The research started with the intention of using four measurement occasions, but 

 
221 
 
three waves of data materialized. Midway through the data collection phase, the training 
network underwent a programme of change, which dampened the willingness to 
participate beyond three occasions. The three wave design is albeit an improvement over 
existing practices, but it is limited to describing linear trajectories. 
3. 
Time perspectives demonstrated impressive continuity using the ZTPI, a valid and 
reliable measure, but these measures are not designed to detect change. Alternative 
measures of time perspective were considered but they were mainly future oriented and 
reflected state measures (Ballard & Seibold, 2004a), which would not allow a broader  
investigation into continuity and change. Another measure of time perspective was 
developed by Jones et al., (2004) which includes past, present and future, however the 
measure was unpublished. 
4. 
Given the lack of prior theorizing on continuity and change in time perspective, the 
study was guided by research questions rather than by a set of formal hypotheses. 
Personality development researchers examining continuity and change in personality and 
dispositional approaches to goal mastery have not used hypotheses, but have been guided 
by a set research questions. The current lack of theorizing about continuity and change in 
time perspective is evidenced in the absence of longitudinal research examining rank 
order mean level and individual differences in change and continuity.  
5. 
The study‘s results are not generalizable to a wider audience and would require 
replication with another adult sample. 
6. 
The ZTPI has demonstrated inadequate model fit statistics using structural equation 
modeling (Worrell & Mello, 2007) and some authors have reported lower than expected 
scale reliabilities (Milfont & Gouveia, 2006). Validation studies have raised questions 
about construct, discriminant and face validity. Face validity was raised directly by 
Milfont et al. (2008) as a concern with items in the ZTPI which reflect personality 

 
222 
 
measures. In a validation study, Worell and Mello (2007) added that a substantial amount 
of survey items did not load on any of the five time perspectives in a sample of 
adolescence. Despite this challenge, the ZTPI is regarded as a promising measure that 
addresses discriminant validity (McGrath and Tschan 2004). It appears that the measure 
requires research to address these concerns. 
7. 
The statistical approaches used in the research have limitations. RANOVA is limited 
to between person differences, it assumes no missing data, and imposes unrealistic 
assumptions on longitudinal data such as sphericity which is unlikely to hold in practice. 
Latent growth modeling takes a top down approach and fits a single trajectory to the 
sample. In the presence of latent groupings, a latent growth model can be unsuitable 
because the trajectory fitted to the data does not consider latent groupings. 
An alternative approach such as fitting individual trajectories to the data may provide 
additional insights for change such as spaghetti plots (Oi-man et al., 2008). Spaghetti 
plots are a first step to examining individual level change and they rely on longitudinal 
data in long format. Individual scores are plotted against time and a series of plots are 
generated which describe different change trajectories. The advantage of the spaghetti plot 
is shown in Li et al. (2012) where team process trajectories were used to critique a default 
linear development of team process dynamics. Rather than assuming a default growth 
trajectory each team‘s process dynamic can be described using a separate mathematical 
function. 
 
9.2 New research opportunities  
There are a number of future research opportunities arising from the present study which 
suggest that a new temporally sensitive measure of time perspective is required so that 
time perspective is modelled as a process. Secondly, intervention research can draw on 

 
223 
 
time perspectives so that researchers know about when to intervene and how to promote 
and offset time perspectives. Thirdly, the development of a time sensitive measure of tie 
perspective can open new research avenues into organizational research such as 
socialization of new instructors‘ into training organizations. 
9.2.1. Development of a temporally sensitive measure of time perspective 
 
Prior to any discussion about changing time perspectives, a measure of time 
perspective that fits within the temporalist research agenda should be developed. The 
measure of time perspective applied to early school leavers should include evaluative, 
cognitive, emotional items and events, but should not take the form of multi item surveys. 
The new measure may best be presented in a graphical form to manage literacy 
difficulties and to reflect a trajectory of a changing time perspective.  Perhaps a platform 
for this measure is the learner‘s mobile phone where they are prompted by text message to 
complete a picture on their phones and describe the events that are linked to the 
trajectories. Future research might develop and validate a measure of time perspective that 
is suitable for temporal research among early school leavers. 
9.2.2. Cross level phenomenon 
 
An interesting research opportunity for time perspective, assuming a time sensitive 
measure, would be to examine change in time perspective as a function of other 
phenomenon happening at higher levels within the organization. For example, what is the 
relationship between the changes in time perspectives and how an organizational change 
programme evolves? If an organizational change programme is imposed on individuals 
does the trajectory for future time perspective show decline and over what interval? What 
parts of the organizational change programme has greatest/least impact on changing time 
perspectives? If resistance to change is being examined, will past positive increase with 

 
224 
 
rising resistance to change as individuals recall the past as a means of solidifying routines 
so that the pace of change declines or at least stabilizes?  
9.2.3. Shared temporal cognitions- Is there a contagion effect? 
Research examining shared temporal cognitions using the ZTPI suggest that time 
perspectives should be regarded as individual differences (Bartel & Milliken, 2004). 
However, from a temporalist view, an interesting study might examine a contagion effect 
in that an instructors time perspectives are ―contaminated by‖ those of learners so that 
there is a time to exposure. How long does it take for time perspectives to reflect higher 
levels of present fatalism in individual instructors as a result of working in training 
environment? Can the reverse occur in that new instructors who are present fatalistic 
observe a decline in their levels of present fatalism as a result of working with early 
school leavers? A temporalist perspective will focus on leads and lags such that present 
fatalism lags the exposure to the training centre environment. 
9.2.4. Intention to leave school early or return to training  
The youth work context might form a new line of time perspective intervention 
research, especially among those who plan to leave school before they achieve their 
Leaving Cert. While it is important to consider the intention to leave school early, it is 
essential that researchers capture the intention of an early school leaver to pursue any 
further education and training opportunities or engage with the labour market. An obvious 
starting point might be to examine the relationship between time perspective and the 
intention to leave school early by modeling time perspectives as latent classes, where 
membership of a class heightens or dampens the intention to leave school early. Similarly, 
it is important to examine processes that prevent or dissuade the early school leaver from 
engaging with further study or progressing to the labour market. Once the early school 

 
225 
 
leaver has progressed, it would be equally desirable to investigate processes that help 
them to maintain improvement and identify processes that prevent them from retaining 
employment or staying in further education. A practical piece of research would be to 
examine if attending a training organization makes and improvement in learner self-
esteem and self efficacy and future time perspective over their two year course at the 
training organization. The research opportunity ideally lends itself to the phenomenon 
which has an onset, duration and offset (Roe, 2008). Work experience is a central part of 
the early school leaver‘s programme at the training organization which can last for 
between two and twelve weeks. Exploring the trajectory of early school leavers‘ 
commitment to an employer over the interval of work experience would be a significant 
practical and theoretical contribution. 
 
Concluding remarks 
 
The barriers to time research can be summarized by Carlstein (1977), cited in Bergmann, 
1983, p.498 ―Time adopts the somewhat discourteous practice of wearing different hats 
which are seldom raised to meet the unwary researcher with an unambiguous meaning‖  
Interdisciplinary research on time using new and existing conversations can incrementally 
disentangle the many faces of time, and for temporal research to flourish it must build 
consensus and technical certainty (Pfeffer, 1993).

Introduction to the survey 
My name is Blaze Aylmer and I am a Community Training Centre, 
(CTC), manager in Galway.  I am undertaking research as part of my 
PhD at Dublin City University under the supervision of Dr. Finian 
Buckley, tel. 017005658. My contact details are 0878207469 and email 
address is blazeaylmer@gmail.com 
The study examines how CTC staff, managers and boards view issues 
around time. The research seeks your views on the variety of ways in 
which time is considered in your personal, professional and work related 
lives. 
I sincerely appreciate the demands on your time. The questionnaire 
should only take about 20-25 minutes to complete. This study is a 15 
month longitudinal study which seeks to gain insights into the ways in 
which you consider time. Therefore I will be seeking your cooperation 
on five separate measurement occasions spread out over the coming 15 
months. The subsequent surveys will be shorter and should take about 
15-20 minutes to complete. In the event that the self addressed envelope 
is mislaid, please return the survey to:  Blaze Aylmer Monatigue 
Craughwell Co Galway. 
A good response rate is essential to the successful completion of my PhD 
and your time and effort is especially appreciate. All responses will be 
treated in strict confidence.
