IN MEMORIAM 
SENSEI SIDNEY (SHLOMO) FAIGE 
1932–2007 
A great human being, a real master. 
Acknowledgments 
Without the support of my parents 
and family, my martial arts career 
would have been much poorer. 
Without their encouragement, this 
book would never have come to 
life. To my mother and late father; 
to Aviva, the love of my life; and to 
Nimrod and Dotan, my incredible 
children: thank you! 
A special thanks to Sensei Roy 
Faige, co-author on this work, for his advice, support and 
help. And for a life-long friendship! 
Th ank you to Shay Levy, Gil Faige, Tamir Carmi, Itay 
Leibovich, Nimrod and Dotan De Bremaeker and Ziv Faige, 
who posed for the photos. And to Guli Cohen, a fantastic 
photographer and so special human being. 
Many masters have infl uenced my martial arts career. 
I should mention among many, of course Sensei Faige, but 
also Maitre Ravinet, Maitre Decantor, Maitre Caronia, 
Maitre Calmette, Sensei Myazaki, Sensei Sawada and Sensei 
Harada. I also owe a lot to many training partners along the 
years. I should mention among so many: Of course the fi ve 
fi ghting sons of Sensei Faige, but also Yannick Pierrard, Serge 
Coucke, Rui Monteiro, and my brother Luc De Bremaeker.

Foreword
I started Judo at age 6, and have never stopped training since. In the early Sixties, Judo was the mysterious Oriental art 
which would allow you to vanquish a stronger opponent by using his own power against him. It was the beginning of the 
discovery of Oriental martial arts by the general Western public.
But about seven years later, I saw, by accident, my fi rst Bruce Lee movie, and it was like a revelation! Th at was the 
martial art I wanted to be profi cient in. Th e success of the Bruce Lee movies, and the ensuing kung fu phenomenon, 
are testimony to the fascination that the discovery of such fi ghting profi ciency instilled into the Western masses. In my 
humble opinion, a great part of the interest it aroused lay in the sophisticated kicking moves that the bulk of the fi ght 
scenes consisted of. Kicking in fi ghts was a novelty of sorts in Western culture, and it explains, in my opinion, the big 
martial arts boom of the Seventies and Eighties. I, for my part, then decided to look for a karate school, and took up 
Shotokan karate. 
Shotokan karate is a very traditional martial art, very well organized didactically, and emphasizes hard training 
and basic work. However, it is not an art known for extravagant kicks, which was somewhat disappointing to me. 
Nevertheless, I never stopped practicing Shotokan, or a Shotokan-derived style, during all my athletic years.
In parallel to my basic and uninterrupted Shotokan training, I decided to explore other arts, a few years at a time, 
as opportunities arose. During all my career, I practiced seriously, among others, and relevant to this work: karatedo of 
the Wado-ryu, Shotokai and Kyokushinkai schools, full-contact karate, taekwondo, savate-boxe francaise and two styles 
of jujutsu. Less intensively, I also practiced capoeira and the soft  styles of kung fu. Th is, all together, allowed me to have 
the basis for my own personal research and individual training into the art of kicking.
In 1983, my quest took me to the Shi-Heun school of Sensei Sidney Faige. Shi-Heun is a Shotokan-based style, 
with intertwined Judo practice, which emphasizes extreme conditioning, total fi ghting under various rules sets and 
the personal quest for what works best for oneself. It is basically a precursor to the much later phenomena of Mixed 
Martial Arts. A winning combination, no doubt, and it is no wonder that the direct disciples of sensei Faige roamed the 
tournament scene undefeated for years. 
Points tournament fi ghting was mainly WUKO (World Union of Karate Organizations) those days, and a rather dull 
aff air. It generally consisted of two competitors jumping up and down, waiting for the other to take the initiative, so as 
to be able to stop-reverse punch him. I think this situation did a lot to hurt the standing of Japanese karate, and it is to 
me no wonder that taekwondo became an Olympic sport, and karate not (yet). Uncharacteristically, when my name 
was called for a fi ght in one of those tournaments, there was spontaneous applause from the spectators, as they knew 
they were going to see some kicking, oft en spectacular. My point is: Th at is what people came for, and that is what they 
expected from “martial arts.”
As mentioned, it is my strong belief that kicking is a big part of what made the appeal of Oriental martial arts. 
It is also my belief that kicking is more effi  cient than punching! I know this is going to make a few people jump up in 
disagreement, and that there has always been an ongoing debate about the subject. Th erefore, I’ll qualify my opinion: 
I strongly believe that kicking is more effi  cient than punching, but profi ciency takes much more work. When put this way, 
I hope there will be much less opposition.

Kicking is more effi  cient than punching:
because of the longer range;
• 
because the muscles of the leg are much more 
• 
powerful than those of the arms;
because kicking targets, unlike punching, go from 
• 
the toes up to the head;
because of the surprise eff ect: People always expect 
• 
less to be kicked than punched.
Opponents of this axiom will point out that kicks 
are inherently slower than punches, can be jammed 
because they only work at long ranges, and cannot be 
delivered from many positions. It is my experience 
that, aft er a lot of dedicated work, kicks can be as swift  
as punches, and can be used at all ranges and from all 
positions.
During all my training years, I invested a lot of 
time, personal drilling and research in the kicking 
arts. I tried all training tips and tried out all kicks 
variations in actual fi ghts and tournaments, and I so 
developed my personal kicking style. In my years of 
research, I came across many treatises, but very few 
actually dedicated to kicking. Th e few works I found 
about kicking, although generally very good, were 
usually style-restricted, or unorganized. As I never 
found the kind of book I would have liked to have when I started my martial arts career, I decided to write it myself: 
Th ere has never been an attempt, to the best of my knowledge, to compile and organize, all the diff erent basic kick types 
and variations, in order to off er a basis of personal exploration or to serve as a reference work. I will try to achieve this, 
however imperfectly, and I hope that this work will be built upon to provide the sorely needed basic encyclopedia of the 
realm of martial arts kicking.
And now, a last word about punching! It is important to emphasize to the reader that the strong views expressed in 
this foreword are not meant in any way or form to denigrate punching arts. As mentioned, martial arts are a whole with 
diff erent possible emphases: A complete martial artist should be profi cient in punching, kicking, throwing, evading, and 
more; with his own preferences and particular skills, of course. More than that: Th ere is no kicking without punching 
profi ciency! Punching is necessary for closing the gap, feinting, setting up a kick, following up, and more. Th is will be 
clear from most of the applications described in this work. And punching is sometimes the best or the only answer in 
some situations. I have known some extraordinary punching martial artists, using kicks only as feints and set-ups. 
On the other hand, great kickers, like Bill “Superfoot” Wallace, were extremely skilled punchers as well! (I remember 
well, in one of his seminars, doing more push-ups in an hour than in the whole previous month). In other words: well-
rounded practice is the key!
A last word before we can proceed with our exploration of the realm of martial arts kicks: I would not want the 
preceding introduction to be misunderstood as an appeal to always kick and especially high-kick in a fi ght. Not only is it 
not suitable for all morphologies and mindsets, but even the best kicker in the world should not deliver a high kick just 
because he can! A high kick should be delivered only when and because it is suitable for the fi ghter’s specifi c situation.

FOREWORD   7

Introduction
Th is book is not a “how to” book for the neophyte, but a reference work for the experienced martial artist. It presupposes 
the knowledge of stances, footwork, and concepts of centerline, guards, distance, evasions, and a good technical level 
in one’s chosen style, including kicking. Th is book is intended as a tool for self-exploration and research about kicking 
outside one’s specifi c style. Th erefore, the description of the diff erent kicks is very succinct and the typical applications are 
only briefl y explained. We rely more on the illustrations to exemplify his point and let the reader expand on their own.
Th is is also why we have preferred drawings over photographs: Th e key points can be clearly emphasized in the 
drawings, when photos can sometimes hide important cues.
Th e experienced reader will immediately understand that our basic background is Japanese karate. Th is is 
unavoidable, but not purposeful. Th is work tries to be as “style-less” as possible, as its purpose is to bridge across the 
diff erent schools on the basis of the common immutable principles. We consider the martial arts as an interconnected 
whole, where styles are just interpretations of some principles and strategies, and their adaptation to certain sets of 
rules, cultural constraints, or morphologies: It is the same thing, but with diff erent ways to focus on it. It is purposeful 
that, in the pictures and illustrations, the reader will see technical diff erences, in order to underline the style-less point 
of view of the treatise. Sometimes the foot of the standing leg is fl at on the fl oor, as required in traditional Japanese 
styles, and sometimes the heel is up as in certain deliveries of Korean arts. Th e biomechanical principles are identical for 
trained artists and those diff erences of emphasis are meaningless. Th is book does not present an axiomatic way to kick! 
In the same vein, arms during kicking are sometimes close to the body in hermetic guard, and sometimes loose and 
counterbalancing the kicking move. Hands can be open, or fi sts tight.
Th is Japanese background, though, and more precisely Shotokan karatedo, is probably benefi cial, as it tends to 
encourage strong technical work from relatively low stances, which is important for basic description. It also encouraged 
the organization and classifi cation that we imperfectly attempted.
It has proved very diffi  cult to name and divide the kicks in groups: Many compromises had to be made. We have 
given the techniques descriptive names in English, whenever possible the most commonly used names. But the more 
complex and exotic kicks, and the hybrid kicks, have sometimes several diff erent appellations in use, while being 
diffi  cult to describe. Th e names given could be therefore disputed by some, and improvements can defi nitely be 
made: Th is is the fi rst time such an exhaustive eff ort at compilation has been made, and we hope it will be the base 
for improvement. For the basic kicks common to all styles, we have added the respective original foreign names. Here 
again, we apologize in advance to the purists of all styles: It is clear that the description of a technique cannot be in all 
details valid for all styles. For example, the basic front kick is taught diff erently in Shotokan karate than in taekwondo; 
And we gave both names to our front kick. Th is writing license of ours tends to underline the basic common factors and 
principles in the sea of small nuances of execution. Th e original foreign names in Japanese or Korean are just there as 
an indication for further research by the reader. It should also be noted that some techniques have diff erent names in 
diff erent schools of the same art!
For the more complex or exotic kicks, we have purposely omitted original names. Only when a kick is especially 
typical of a certain style, did we mention it, as a tribute to the specifi c school.

 
INTRODUCTION   9
We also apologize in advance for the transcription of foreign names, as purists could dispute the way it is done: Th ere 
are several ways to transcribe foreign sounds, and we have chosen a way arbitrarily.
Our eff orts at classifi cation proved even more diffi  cult, and resulted in many arbitrary decisions. Again, we hope that 
our work will be the basis for many comments, discussions and fi nally improvements. Th e way we divided the kicks for 
easier presentation has no technical importance. It is based on the common way to describe kicks. Moreover, many kicks 
do belong to two or more categories. We’ve arbitrarily decided in which of the two or more categories a specifi c kick 
should be described, as it suits better the fl ow of the narrative or the logic specifi cally presented. A kick belonging to 
several categories will be presented fully in one, though, it will also be itemized and briefl y cited in the other categories 
it could belong to. Th is book only covers basic kicks. Advanced kicks like fl ying kicks, ground kicks, feint kicks, stop 
kicks, low kicks, double kicks and joint kicks are beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, not all possible basic kicks are 
described for a variety of reasons.
Some kicks have been omitted, as we felt we had to draw the line somewhere. Again the decision was arbitrary, and 
could be considered as open for discussion. First, the wide range of nuances of given kicks have been omitted—as 
already mentioned, the same basic kicks are delivered in slightly diff erent ways in all diff erent styles and schools. Th e 
small diff erences come from the diff erent emphasis of each style, and do not alter the basic principles. 
We therefore described the kicks in the ways that their own experiences dictate as best, and each reader can adapt it to 
his own personality. 
Second, hybrid kicks variations have been omitted, as the infi nite number of intermediate possible deliveries in 
between two kicks would make this endeavor ridiculous. For example, many possible hybrids of front and roundhouse 
kicks could be presented here, each one with diff erent levels of emphasis on the “front” side and the “roundhouse” side.
Kicks combinations, and kick-punch combinations are infi nite in numbers. Th erefore, only the basic and well-known 
kicks combinations, and those with some relevance, will be presented here.
Knee strikes, although very eff ective and versatile, will not be presented: For the purpose of this work, they will not be 
considered as kicks.
Finally, the kicks which we feel are already in the realm of acrobatics and aesthetics have been omitted, and out of 
the scope of eff ective martial arts. Some of the over-complex fl ying kicks of some Korean arts or some acrobatic kicks 
of capoeira come to mind. Th is was a judgment call which in no way seeks to denigrate any of those arts: Some of those 
acrobatic kicks, when performed by very skilled students of these styles, are probably very eff ective, but still out of the 
range of feasibility for most martial artists outside of these schools.
Th e kicks presented in this work are generally presented in a prescribed manner: aft er a brief general introduction 
and the description of the kick (mainly by illustrations), the key points to remember for a good execution will be noted. 
Please remember that the book is intended for conversant martial artists. Th e relevant targets to be kicked in most 
applications will be mentioned, although only general targets will be mentioned: Th e specifi c and precise vulnerable 
points are out of the scope of this volume. Following the discussion of targets an example of typical application will be 
detailed and illustrated. Th e typical application will generally be, unless irrelevant, a detailed use or set up of the given 
kick in a tournament-type situation. Th is will generally be a combination based on alternating diff erent attack angles or/
and levels (For example: high-low-high, and/or outside/inside/outside), or the Progressive Indirect Attack principle as it 
is called by jeet kune do artists. Th e tactical principle involved will not be detailed or presented systematically though, as 
it is beyond the scope of this volume. Of course, those applications will also usually be relevant to real life situations and 
training work. Whenever possible, specifi c training tips to improve the given kick will be detailed. Th e specifi c training 
section will be brief and will only deal with the very specifi c characteristics of the kick and the ways to perfect them. 
Last, and in order to widen the scope of applications, an additional example of the use of the kick will be presented, 
generally more suitable to a self-defense or mixed martial arts application.


CHAPTER ONE
Front Kicks
Th e basic front kick is generally the fi rst kick taught to martial arts novices, as it is relatively easy to 
deliver and a more natural movement than the other kicks. It is therefore the perfect base for the beginner 
to build upon in order to develop his kicking profi ciency. Th is is where to start your kicking career. 
 Front kicks in most of their variations are also the perfect kicks for real life situations: being easier to 
deliver and master, they are appropriate for every level of profi ciency while being very safe and eff ective. 
Front kicks, in one version or the other, are really the bread and butter of fi ghting: they are used in 
combination attacks, as feints, as distance closers, and of course, when mastered, as decisive single attacks. 
 Many variations of the basic front kick will be presented in this chapter, to allow for most possible 
dynamic situations in sports or everyday life. 
1.1 The Penetrating Front Kick
Mae geri kekomi (Shotokan karate), Jik tek / Tshe the / Quan bian jiao (kung fu), Ahp chagi / Ahp cha tzirugi (taekwondo), 
Bênção (capoeira), Gyaku geri (Shorinji kempo), Chuong tieu cuoc / Truc cuoc (viet vo dao)
General
Th is front kick is very powerful and very fast. We named it “penetrating,” to diff erentiate it from the upward front kick 
described later in the chapter. Unlike the upward front kick, the penetrating front kick travels in parallel to the fl oor into the 
target. On the other hand, the upward front kick strikes targets like the chin or groin from below. Th e skilled martial artist 
is well aware of the fact that there are many variations between the two extremes and front kicks can be a combination of 
both the upward and forward movement. But only the two extremes of the range will be described in this work.
It is interesting to note that, because of the rules of competition, front kicks are not practiced in savate-boxe française. 
Fighting in savate drives home the point about how important the front kick really is.
On the other hand, the front kick is probably the most-used kick in traditional karate katas, although much more 
in its upward form. Th e penetrating aspect of the kick is, for example, emphasized in the traditional Unsu kata of the 
Shotokan-ryu style. Th e relevant kata sequence is presented in the kata excerpt shown in Figures 1.1.1 through 1.1.5, as 
an illustration of the concept of penetration.

This kata excerpt shows a combination that includes a penetrating front kick.

12   CHAPTER ONE
Figures 1.1.14 through 1.1.20 show the execution of the kick, with the kicking leg lowered in front. 
Figure 1.1.14 
Figure 1.1.15 
Figure 1.1.16
Description
In fi ghting stance (see Figure 1.1.9), raise the knee of the back leg as quickly and as high as possible (Figure 1.1.10). 
Extend the leg in such a way that the foot travels directly to target from the chambered position, nearly in a motion 
parallel to the fl oor (Figure 1.1.11). Nearing the impact, the hips push forward for the penetrating eff ect. Immediately 
aft er the impact with the ball of the foot, the leg is retracted as quickly as possible into the chambered position with 
the knee high, as a protection. Th e foot is then lowered either (a) in front, in fi ghting stance (Figure 1.1.12), or (b) back 
where it came from (Figure 1.1.13).
Th e kick is usually delivered to connect with the ball of the foot (In Japanese: tshusoku, koshi, josokutei). Sometimes 
the whole plant of the foot is used. In some styles, the stiff ened toes (In Japanese: tsumasaki) are used against very 
specifi c anatomical points, for example the Sokusen geri of Uechiryu karate, or ninjutsu kicks.
In Wado-ryu karate, there are even names for combinations including the ubiquitous front kick. For example, Kette 
Jun-tsuki: high lunge punch, rear leg front kick and front jab while landing forward (See Figures 1.1.6 through 1.1.8)
Figure 1.1.6 
Figure 1.1.7 
Figure 1.1.8
The ubiquitous front kick is often included in combinations such as the Kette Jun-tsuki combination (high lunge punch, rear leg front kick and front jab 
while landing forward) shown here.

Key Points
Th e foot you’re standing on must be fl at on the fl oor to off er support for the forward hip movement (Figure 1.1.27).
• 
To avoid knee injury, do not overextend the kicking leg.
• 
Lift  your toes when kicking: the kick connects with the ball of the foot (Figure 1.1.28).
•

14   CHAPTER ONE
Specific Training
Kick above a chair placed in front of you, with the seat toward you (Figures 1.1.37 and 1.1.38).
• 
Tie a belt just below the knee of the standing leg, hold parallel to the fl oor while blocking the path of the kicking leg. 
• 
Th is will force you to lift  the knee high fi rst, before being able to develop the kick (Figures 1.1.39 through 1.1.41).

Figure 1.1.38
Use a chair to help gauge your kicks and 
strengthen your legs.
Targets
Th e targets include the solar plexus, the groin, and the ribs. Th e throat could be a worthy target, but a more diffi  cult one 
to achieve. Because of the penetrating direction, the kick is rarely used higher than the solar plexus.
An interesting target is the front of the thigh of the rear leg of an opponent in fi ghting stance in front of you. 
Th e target is further away than the trunk, which allows for a full development of the kick if you are close. Th e kick will 
cause temporary paralysis of the leg and extreme pain extending to the hip joint. Th is is a special technique of Sensei 
Faige, of the Shi Heun style (See Figures 1.1.29 through 1.1.32)
Figure 1.1.29

Figure 1.1.33 
Figure 1.1.34 
Figure 1.1.35 
Figure 1.1.36
These images show a typical application of the penetrating front kick. 
Typical Application
From fi ghting stance (Figure 1.1.33), lunge forward with a high punch toward your opponent’s eyes. Try to catch or 
control the hand he’ll instinctively raise to block, or at least leave your hand in front of his face (Figure 1.1.34). Kick in 
the lower abdomen, while keeping control of his forward hand. If you have caught it, pull the hand toward you while 
delivering the penetrating kick (Figure 1.1.35). Finish up, while lowering the kicking leg forward, by punching his face 
with your (now) lead hand (Figure 1.1.36).

 
FRONT KICKS   15
Squat and kick. And repeat with other leg. Th en repeat (See Figures 1.1.42 through 1.1.47).

illustrated in Figures 1.1.1 through 1.1.5.

• 
then lower. Perform in front of partner doing the same, 
and try to beat him at speed.
In chambered position, resist a partner’s downward

push to the count of ten (isometrics). See Figure 1.1.50.

16   CHAPTER ONE
When a penetrating front kick scores to the groin or the abdomen, it will always result in your opponent bending 
forward to alleviate the pain, and therefore setting him up for specifi c follow-ups. Figures 1.1.57 through 1.1.64 show 
one possible follow-up action.

Self-defense
Th is is an extremely powerful kick, especially in a self-defense situation with shoes on.
Th row keys, wallet or any object toward the eyes of the assailant (Figure 1.1.53) and kick groin, abdomen or ribs when 
he instinctively lift s his hands (Figure 1.1.54). Lower back the kicking leg and let the foot rebound on the fl oor (Figure 
1.1.55) for the launch of an upward front kick to his bent-over head (Figure 1.1.56). 

 
FRONT KICKS   17
1.2 The Upward Front Kick
Mae geri keage (Shotokan karate, Kin geri, if directed to groin), Teng toi (kung 
fu), Ahp Chagi-Ahp Cha pusugi (taekwondo), Sepak sekop (pencak silat), 
Kinteki sokushi geri (ninjutsu), Ponteira (capoeira)
General
As already mentioned, the upward front kick hits the target from down under. 
As such, it is shorter and less powerful than the penetrating version. Th e groin 
being a preferred target, it is, however, a very eff ective kick in self-defense 
situations. Th e upward front kick to the groin, given with the front of the ankle 
joint, is called in Japanese karate: Kin geri, Kogan geri or Kinteki geri, and is 
learned as a specifi c kick, on top of the regular upward front kick (Mae geri 
keage) delivered to all other targets (See Figure 1.2.1).
Th e diff erences between upward and penetrating are clear 
from the comparison of the arrows in Figures 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. 
As mentioned before, there is an endless range of nuances between 
those two extremes, and the martial artist will choose the right 
amount of “upward-ness” and “penetration” that suits him and the 
particular situation.
Th e upward front kick is the most common kick to be found in 
traditional karate katas. Th is kick is presented in the kata excerpt 
shown in Figures 1.2.4 through 1.2.8, from a basic Shotokan 
karate form.

Figure 1.2.7 
Figure 1.2.8
This kata excerpt includes an upward front kick.
Description
Lift  the knee of the back leg high into the same chambered position (Figure 1.2.9), but this time, extend the leg 
naturally from below (Figure 1.2.11). As soon as the target is hit, with the ball or the top of the foot (Kin geri—karate), 
retract to the chamber position (Figure 
1.2.12) and lower the leg in front or 
back. Th e push of the hips is much less 
pronounced in this kick than in the 
penetrating one, but the leg extension 
and retraction are more “whippy.”

Figure 1.2.10 
Figure 1.2.11 
Figure 1.2.12
These images show the execution of an upward front kick.

18   CHAPTER ONE
Figures 1.2.13 and 1.2.14 show the use of the kick to hit the armpit of a hand you control.
Figure 1.2.13 
Figure 1.2.14
These images show the execution of an upward front kick to the armpit.
Key Points
Th e upward movement should not tempt you to lift  the body before and during the 
• 
kick, so as to retain power and avoid telegraphing your intentions.
Th e target is hit with the ball of the foot (for the chin or armpit) or the upper part of 
• 
the foot/ankle (for the groin). See Figure 1.2.15.
Targets
Th e targets for the upward front kick are the chin, armpit (Figure 1.2.16), and groin.
Th e face and the abdomen are valid targets when the opponent is bent forward, 
for example from a previous strike or an armlock.
Typical Application
No man on earth is able to keep his cool with something on a direct trajectory to his 
groin! Th is is true in competition as well as in real life. Use this subconscious instinctive 
reaction to get your opponent to lower his guard for a double punch: from an opposite 
stance (Figure 1.2.17), fi re a real and clear upward front kick toward your opponent’s 
groin (Figure 1.2.18). Jab to his face as soon as his hands start to go down, even if only 
slightly, while lowering your leg forward (Figure 1.2.19). And then throw a powerful 
reverse punch (cross). See Figure 1.2.20. Remember: the simplest things work best! 
Aft er your reverse punch, you can hook his front leg and pull it to his forward (Ko uchi 
gari—judo) to throw him to the fl oor (Figure 1.2.21).

Self-defense
An assailant grabs your sleeve from the side (Figure 1.2.25). Immediately 
immobilize his fi ngers by pushing his grabbing hand onto your arm, while 
circling his grabbing hand from the outside with your grabbed arm (Figure 
1.2.26). Do not let go of his hand and use your whole body while completing 
the circle around his hand and getting him bent-over in a wrist lock (Figure 
1.2.27). As soon as he bends over, kick him in the face with an upward front 
kick (Figure 1.2.28).

1.3 The Straight-leg Upward Kick
Mae keage (karate), Ahp ohlligi (taekwondo), Ponteira esticada (capoeira)
General
Th is kick is not very much used in most Japanese styles, as it is more diffi  cult to place eff ectively than the regular upward 
front kick. Flexible fi ghters will like it, though, and it can be a very surprising kick. It is naturally followed by, or can be 
considered as the set-up for, the downward heel (hatchet) kick (See Chapter 6, Section 5).
Th is kick is very much practiced in most styles as an 
exercise for warm-up, and for fl exibility work to improve 
general kicking performance.
Description
From the fi ghting stance (Figure 1.3.1), bring the rear leg 
forward while keeping it totally straight (Figure 1.3.2). 
Lift  it in front at maximum speed, aiming for the chin 
(Figure 1.3.3).

20   CHAPTER ONE
Figure 1.3.4 
Figure 1.3. 5 
Figure 1.3.6
The image on the left shows how your straight leg-upward kick should move upward toward the opponent’s chin. 
Compare this movement to the two kicks illustrated on the right: the penetrating front kick and the upward front kick, respectively.
Key Points
Speed is the key to the success of this kick.
Targets
Targets are the chin or face, if the opponent is tilted forward.
Th e power of the kick comes from the centrifugal force. It is useful to slightly pivot on the standing foot. Opening the 
foot outwards, like for roundhouse kicks, opens the hip and allows more speed and fl exibility. Usually the leg is brought 
down as a downward hatchet kick on any target available (head, shoulder, arm). In training, lower straight leg forward or 
back to rear position, as of the start. Th e trajectory of the kick is clearly shown in Figure 1.3.4. Compare the straight leg-
upward kick to the other front kicks (Figures 1.3.5 and 1.3.6).
Figure 1.3.7 
Figure 1.3. 8 
Figure 1.3.9
Counter your opponent’s intent to deliver a roundhouse kick by intervening with a swift straight leg-upward kick.
Typical Application
Th is kick can be used as a counter for a roundhouse kick for example, utilizing the forward momentum of the attacking 
opponent. Start the upward motion of the leg when the roundhouse connects with your block. Your kick will contact 
with his chin while he chambers the knee and is carried forward by his momentum. See Figures 1.3.7 through 1.3.9.
Specific Training
Front splits: fl exibility is the secret of speed, especially for straight leg kicks.
Self-defense 
Th is is the perfect kick to hit an opponent bending over from a previous kick or punch. Because of the centrifugal force 
of the kick, even if the opponent manages to place his hands before his face, he will be hitting himself in the face from 
the speed of the upward kick. For example, when attacked by an overhead strike with a stick (Figure 1.3.10), evade with 
a small outside step (Figure 1.3.11), while keeping the back hand up for control. Kick the opponent groin from the 
outside with a small roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, Section 2). See Figure 1.3.12. Retract the leg while he doubles over 
(Figure 1.3.13), and launch a straight leg upward kick with the same leg, to his face (Figure 1.3.14). If possible, use your 
hand to keep or drive his head down toward the rising kick.

Surikonde mae geri (Shotokan karate), Oi geri / Okuri geri (Shorinji-ryu kenkokan), Ahp-bal ahp-Chagi (taekwondo), 
Jun geri (Shorinji kempo, Sankukai karate)
General
Front leg kicking is a fast way to close the distance with the opponent, but it results in less powerful kicks. All kicks can 
be made with the front leg, and the description here is relevant to all kicks described: penetrating, upward, straight leg, 
and more.
Front leg kicking can be used statically, as a stop-kick, or it can be used sliding toward the opponent. Th e front 
leg stop-kick is beyond the scope of this book, so we will talk here only about the sliding front leg kick. Figures 1.4.1 
through 1.4.4 show an example of the static front leg front kick to stop an opponent followed by a “shoot” (Lunge for a 
double leg takedown).
Description
Bring the back leg forward without moving the upper body, so as not to telegraph your slide (Figure 1.4.6). Th e legs are 
slightly crossed. You then lift  the formerly front leg (that was slightly behind—see Figure 1.4.7) with the knee high, and 
you now develop the kick just as you would if it was a rear leg kick (Figure 1.4.8).
Figure 1.4.1

The static front leg front kick can be used to stop an opponent long enough for you to execute a “shoot.”

Figure 1.4.6 
Figure 1.4.7 
Figure 1.4.8
These images illustrate the execution of a front leg front kick.

22   CHAPTER ONE
As you become profi cient with the kick, you can begin 
to proceed as shown in Figures 1.4.9 through 1.4.11. 
Th e rear leg does not cross forward anymore, but the back 
foot comes forward and sort of replaces the front foot. 
Th is is made possible because the front knee lift s a few 
milliseconds before the back leg lands.
Figure 1.4.9 
Figure 1.4.10 
Figure 1.4.11
As your footwork improves, the execution of this kick will change to the 
conﬁ guration shown above.
Figure 1.4.12 
Figure 1.4.13 
Figure 1.4.14
These images show a static front leg front kick being launched from a cat stance.
Key Points
All key points of back leg front kicks are relevant here.
• 
It is imperative to keep the upper body free of any 
• 
movement, especially upward movement.
Th e feet are moving very close to the fl oor—there is no 
• 
jumping or hopping; only sliding.
Targets
Th e targets for the front leg front kick include the solar 
plexus, ribs, and groin. 
Figure 1.4.15 
Figure 1.4.16 
Figure 1.4.17 
Figure 1.4.18
Block your opponent’s vision while you shift your feet, and follow up with a two-kick combination.
Typical Application
Again, the simplest things work best! Lunge with jab toward your opponent’s eyes (Figure 1.4.15) and keep your hand 
there a few seconds to block his vision, while replacing your front foot with the rear one (Figure 1.4.16). Lift  the knee 
and kick the open ribs with the front foot (Figure 1.4.17). Th is is a serious kick, but you can fi nish the combination with 
a power roundhouse from the other leg (Figure 1.4.18).
Figures 1.4.12 through 1.4.14 show the front leg front kick used statically, aft er a backward evasion into cat stance 
(Neko ashi dachi in karate), where the front leg is largely free of body weight.

 
FRONT KICKS   23
Th e front kick, especially when delivered with the front leg, oft en causes a push-away of the opponent. One of the preferred 
follow-ups in these cases is the fl ying knee strike to the body or the head, as presented in Figures 1.4.19 through 1.4.22.
Specific Training
In front of a mirror, check for the elimination of upper body movement and head height bobbing.
• 
Mark the position of the front leg on the fl oor and do the kick while trying longer and longer slides for reach.
• 
Self-defense
Suppose your opponent has practiced martial arts, and is attacking you with high roundhouse kicks. Open yourself with 
a fake half jab, to lure him into another one. When he chambers the leg for his next roundhouse, hop forward while 
lift ing the knee and replace your lead hand in protection (Figure 1.4.24). Kick his groin with a front leg/upward front 
kick, while he delivers the high kick that leaves him unprotected (Figure 1.4.25). Hit him with your lead hand when

1.5 The Side Front Kick
Yoko geri (Wado-ryu karate), Yoko sokugyacku geri kekomi (ninjutsu)
General
Th is is an important variation of the front kick, which is practiced in the Wado-ryu 
style of karate, a style that emphasizes hip movements, evasions and dodging. Th is is 
simply a front kick, penetrating or upward (or other), performed together with a turn 
of the hips. At full kick extension, the upper body does not face the opponent but is 
perpendicular to him (Figure 1.5.1). Th is allows for greater penetration, while giving 
less target surface area for the opponent’s retaliation. It also allows kicking while 
evading an incoming kick or strike to the body’s centerline. It’s interesting to note that 
Figure 1.5.1
At full kick extension, your upper body 
is perpendicular to your opponent.

This kata excerpt shows a variation of this kick in a classical tai chi chuan sequence.
Description
From the fi ghting stance (Figure 1.5.6), start by turning the hips while lift ing the knee for the kick (Figures 1.5.7 
and 1.5.8). Develop the kick just as any front kick type (penetrating, upward, heel), while the hips are already turned 
sideways to your opponent (Figure 1.5.10).

Th e kick can also be practiced from a natural position, as a kick to the side (Figures 1.5.11 through 1.5.13).

Figure 1.5.12 
Figure 1.5.13
The side front kick, this time launched to the side.
in the katas of the Wado-ryu style corresponding to a specifi c Shotokan kata, the side kick is basically this “side front 
kick,” when the Shotokan kata sports a “real” side kick.
It is also interesting to note that a variation of this kick is present in the classical tai chi chuan sequence: two front 
kicks, in succession, which are not delivered at centerline, but obliquely at 45 degrees. Th is is not, of course, totally a side 
front kick, but half-way. Th e principles behind these kicks are the same, though. Th e relevant part of the form—Fen jiao 
or “Split the feet”—is presented in Figures 1.5.2 through 1.5.5.

 
FRONT KICKS   25
Figures 1.5.14 through 1.5.16 show the use of the kick aft er an inside evasion from a punch.

The side front kick used as a “side” kick.
Key Points
Th e hip movement is key, and some pivoting on the foot is 
needed to allow the motion of the hip.
Targets
Th e targets for the side front kick include the solar plexus, 
ribs, and groin.
Typical Application
Th e advantage of this kick is the simultaneous evading action of the body. While the kick is executed, the body pivots 
totally to the side and moves out of the line of a linear attack. Th is is illustrated here on a reverse punch attack (Figures 
1.5.21 through 1.5.24), though it is valid for a front hand jab as well. Keep your back hand in guard while you pivot, 
move out of the line of attack and kick.

26   CHAPTER ONE
Specific Training
Have a partner hold a long stick 
• 
pointed to your sternum, in the 
middle of the body. Execute the kick 
while evading contact. Th e stick forces 
you to turn your hips and rotate your 
body sideways while kicking. See 
Figures 1.5.25 through 1.5.27.
Practice the hip movement in front of 
• 
a mirror.

Have a partner help you practice moving your body 
out of the line of attack while delivering this kick.

training exercise.
Self-defense
When attacked from the side, especially if there is a second opponent in front of you, move slightly forward to get out 
of the line of attack and kick naturally to the side, quickly, without having to turn the hips and body. See Figures 1.5.28 
through 1.5.30.

1.6 The Heel Front Kick
Mae kakato geri (Shotokan karate), Tendangan depan (pencak silat), Teep trong (muay thai), Sokugyacku geri (ninjutsu, 
Ago kin geri, if directed to chin)
General
Th is is simply a penetrating front kick but using the heel to connect. Th e kick is slightly diff erent, because it requires 
more hip forward movement to complete. It is therefore more powerful, and ideal as a stop-kick. It is in its stop-kick 
version that it is very much in use in Th ai boxing (muay thai) to keep the opponent at a distance: it is called a teep kick 
by Th ai boxers. See Figures 1.6.1 through 1.6.3 for a teep stop kick followed by a full front heel kick.

These images show a “teep” stop kick followed by a full front heel kick.

 
FRONT KICKS   27
Key Points
Strongly lift  the toes and foot (Figure 1.6.14).
• 
Th e hips must be very forcefully pushed forward.
• 
Targets
Th e targets for the heel front kick include the solar plexus, ribs, and groin.
Th e heel front kick is also a kick for people who instinctively avoid kicking barefoot because they subconsciously fear 
hurting their toes. Such an inhibition, even if mild, can be enough to subconsciously slow a kick’s delivery.
A variation of this kick, with the foot tilted outward, allows for a powerful kick at closer range. Read about the tilted 
heel front kick in Section 8 of this chapter.
Description
Th e kick starts like a regular penetrating 
kick, with a high knee chambering (see 
Figures 1.6.4 through 1.6.7). Th e foot then 
travels even more in parallel to the fl oor than 
a regular penetrating kick, as the hips push 
strongly forward. Th is kick has a “pushing” 
feeling to it. Th e kick connects with the heel, 
of course (Figures 1.6.8 and 1.6.9).

28   CHAPTER ONE
Th is kick, because of the way it’s done, also allows kicks to the head (See Figure 
1.6.15 for a high front heel stop-kick).
Typical Application
Attack your opponent’s front leg with a strong 
outside sweep kick that will put him off -balance 
and move his front foot toward his inside (Figure 
1.6.16). Raise the knee into chambered position, 
immediately from the sweep impact, without 
touching the fl oor (Figure 1.6.17). Your opponent 
has now his back partly turned to you. Develop 
the front heel kick into his lower back (Figure 
1.6.18). Th is is a very dangerous technique, which 
can damage the spine or kidneys—practice carefully.
Specific Training
Kick over the chair with the back of seat close to you 
• 
(Figure 1.6.19 and 1.6.20).
Kick the bag with the heel at diff erent heights: lower 
• 
abdomen, chest, and face.
Kick a padded target held by a partner: kick for 
• 
penetrating power (See Figures 1.6.21 through 1.6.23).

Self-defense
As soon as an assailant takes hold of your front wrist to control you (Figure 1.6.24), front heel kick with your back leg to 
his solar plexus (Figure 1.6.25), while pulling your arm (and therefore your assailant) toward you. It should be enough, 
but you can then have your kicking foot rebound on the ground for a forward knee strike (Hiza geri—karate) to his 
bent-over head as you also pull downward with your hands (Figure 1.6.27).

FRONT KICKS   29
1.7 The Hopping Front Kick
General
Th is is a regular rear-leg front kick, of any type, with a forward hop of the standing leg while the knee is up and the 
kick is developing. Th is allows for more distance to be covered while the kick is already being delivered. “Hopping” is 
somewhat misleading, because the movement is forward and not upward. Th is is a very useful way to deliver the front 
kick, especially when confronting an opponent who retreats when attacked.
Description
Th e rear knee is lift ed just as for a regular front kick. Together 
with the knee lift  and the development of the kick (Figure 1.7.2), 
a small hopping/sliding step is made forward. But when the foot 
connects, the standing foot is fi rmly on the fl oor (Figure 1.7.3).
Figures 1.7.4 through 1.7.8 show the execution of the kick, 
with the forward hop aft er the knee has been chambered. 
Figures 1.7.9 through 1.7.11 show the advantage of delivering 
such a kick to a retreating opponent; the gray line clearly shows 
the length of the hop.

eliminate any possibility of a continued threat.

30   CHAPTER ONE
Key Points
No body movement upward.
• 
Th e sole of the foot stays as close to the fl oor as 
• 
possible.
When the kick connects, the standing foot is fi rmly 
• 
planted on the fl oor.
Targets
Typical targets include the solar plexus, the groin, and 
the ribs. See the corresponding penetrating front kick 
(Section 1 of this chapter) for additional details.
Figure 1.7.20 
Figure 1.7.21
After lulling your opponent with a series of short front kicks, deliver a long hopping front kick to break through his defenses.

Figure 1.7.12 
Figure 1.7.13 
Figure 1.7.14 
Figure 1.7.15
These images show a variation on the hopping front kick principle, with the hops replaced by other tactics.
Typical Application
Th e best use of this kick is aft er tricking your opponent into believing that your front kicks are short, and therefore causing 
him to “learn” to retreat less when you kick and become overconfi dent. For example, and maybe aft er a few other “short” 
front kicks, deliver a front leg front kick (Figure 1.7.18), where your back leg takes the place of your chambering front leg. 
Immediately, lower your attacking foot in front (Figure 1.7.19), as far as is safe, and start delivering a long hopping front 
kick with the rear leg (Figure 1.7.20), covering much more distance than your opponent expects (Figure 1.7.21). Be careful 
for possible counter attack in between your two kicks. Th is is a great combination against a “retreater” fl eeing back as soon 
as he discerns a move on your part. And never forget: nobody can run backward as quickly as you can run forward!
A variation of the principle behind this kick is presented in Figures 1.7.12 through 1.7.15: a low kick given to the 
opponent’s knee while putting oneself slightly off -balance forward. Th e full hop is replaced by some leaning onto the 
opponent’s knee and a small hop into a “shooting” lunge.

 
FRONT KICKS   31
Specific Training
Kick the heavy bag from an increasing distance. Mark the fl oor with your best distance to date and try to beat it 
• 
next time.
Repeat kick and hop without lowering the leg. Come back to a high-knee chambered position and repeat. Try twenty 
• 
repetitions before switching legs.
Self-defense
Th is is the perfect kick to use on an assailant who is retreating or whom you have pushed away from you. For example: 
on an arms-free front bear hug, immediately clap your attacker’s ears (Figure 1.7.23) and push his head away while 
kneeing his groin (Figure 1.7.24). Push him away vigorously with a step, from a low stance, to get him to a safe distance 
(Figure 1.7.25). Th en, catch up with him with a penetrating front kick (Figure 1.7.27)—hopping style if necessary! 
You can follow up with a palm strike to the nose as you land your kicking foot forward (Figure 1.7.28). And then a full 
power “low kick” straight roundhouse to the outside knee or thigh (Figure 1.7.29).

1.8 The Tilted Heel Front Kick
Sepak naga (pencak silat)
General 
Th is is a variation of the heel kick, with the foot tilted outward. Th e kick is delivered just 
like the regular heel kick, but the tilt allows for power even if the kicking range is shorter. 
It also allows one to strike without the hindrance of the opponent’s guard. Th e kick is 
delivered straight, but there is some feeling of “roundness,” of going slightly around the 
guard. Th is kick is very surprising when well-executed. Its low version, attacking the 
knees, is very popular in many soft  kung fu styles. (See Figure 1.8.1)
Description
While raising the knee, turn the foot outward at the ankle (Figure 1.8.3). Lift  the knee high and 
kick straight, in parallel to the fl oor, with a goal of going over and around the guard (Figure 
1.8.4). As soon as the heel connects deeply, the knee retreats to the chambered position.
Figure 1.8.1
This image depicts the low version 
of the tilted heel front kick.

Side view of the tilted heel front kick.
Figure 1.8.9 shows the kick being used at low ribs level, and under the guard of the opponent. Figure 1.8.10 is a close-up 
of the kick at impact.
Typical Application
Th is is the ideal front kick when the distance from your opponent is short; for example, aft er an attempted lead or rear 
hand punch. Here is a description of a counter to a lead hand punch to the face: step 45 degrees forward out of the line 
of attack (Figure 1.8.12) while controlling the punch, and immediately chamber the (now) back leg for a tilted heel 
front kick (Figure 1.8.13). If possible grab the striking arm for control: pull and keep it up to “open” the ribs for the kick 
(Figure 1.8.14). You can follow up with an inside sweep of his front leg with your descending kicking foot, while pulling 
his arm down (Figure 1.8.15).
Key Points
Lift  the knee high
• 
Strike “penetratingly”
• 
Targets
Mainly the lower ribs. Also the solar plexus, and the 
higher ribs.

 
FRONT KICKS   33
Specific Training
Hit the heavy bag, as powerfully as possible, from shorter and shorter distances. Th is forces you to lift  the knee high and 
kick in a straight fashion.
Self-defense
An assailant tries to get a hold of you and reaches for 
an arm grab or an arm lock (Figure 1.8.16). As he is 
close enough to grab you, he is too close for a regular 
full-fl edged kick. Lift  the foot immediately while tilting 
and kick the groin or the ribs exposed by his extended 
arms (Figure 1.8.17). As you are close, elbow him in 
the face while lowering the foot, with a full hip twist 
(Mawashi empi uchi—karate). See Figure 1.8.18.
1.9 The Outward-tilted Front Kick
Gyacku mawashi geri (Shukokai karate, Shorinji-ryu Kenkokan karate), Inverted hook kick (jeet kune do)
General
Th is kick is not to be confused with the tilted heel front kick: this is not truly a straight kick but, in some ways, a hybrid 
of a front kick and an outside crescent kick. Th is is not an extremely powerful kick, but sneaky and surprising. 
Th e surprise eff ect comes from the way that an opponent, who stands in fi ghting stance with his profi le forward, 
feels that he is protected from front kicks. Well executed, it is a diffi  cult kick to parry, and has brought this author 
many points in tournament karate. It is also very eff ective in real life if targeting the groin of an opponent who feels 
protected because he stands with his side forward. Th is is not a feint kick, as the change in trajectory comes at the end 
of the kicking motion, and there is no intention of provoking a reaction from the opponent. It is told that the technique, 
inspired by Chinese Arts, was introduced in Japanese karate by Nakayama Masatoshi, direct student of the founder of 
the Shotokan-ryu, Gishin Funakoshi. In Okinawan karate, it is oft en referred to as the “Dragon” kick.
Description
Lift  the knee swift ly, like any regular front kick (Figure 1.9.2). From the chambered position, extend the leg while 
mildly changing the trajectory inward and turning the foot outward (Figures 1.9.3 and 1.9.4). Th e kick connects from 
inside out. Th e whole feeling of the kick is that of a front kick: the knee is the axis of the development of the kick, 
and the target is hit with the ball of the foot. Th ere are many possible nuances in between the two kicks (front and 
outside crescent), but the change in trajectory and tilt of the foot should be just enough to skirt the obstacles in the 
way of the target, no more.

Mislead your opponent with easy-to-block kicks followed by punches, then follow up with an outward-tilted front kick.
Specific Training
Heavy bag kicking: stand in front, but hit the side of the bag, at a mark you have made at belt’s level.
• 
Kick a padded target held sideways by a partner: drill for speed and power (See Figures 1.9.16 through 1.9.18).
• 
Figure 1.9.8 shows an application of the kick.
Key Points
Up to the chambered knee, this is totally a straight front kick.
• 
Lift  the toes and hit with the ball of the foot.
• 
Targets
Th is is not as powerful as a penetrating kick, and therefore to be used 
only on soft  targets: solar plexus, groin and lower ribs.
In tournaments, you should try to hit the abdomen below the guard 
(Figure 1.9.9), as low as possible within the rules framework: usually 
above the groin, but just below the belt. It is then extremely diffi  cult 
to block.
Typical Application
Th is is again an ideal kick to trick an opponent who stands with his 
side toward you, by establishing a routine that you will break. Aft er a 
few “regular” front kicks, your opponent will expect more of the same. 
Deliver a rear leg front kick that he will easily block (Figure 1.9.11). 
Land your foot back to the rear (Figure 1.9.12), and immediately throw 
a deep lunge/reverse punch to the outside of his head to force him to 
over-block and concentrate on his upper 
outside (Figures 1.9.13 and 1.9.14). 
Th e reverse punch will pull the rear leg 
into an outward-tilted front kick on his 
lower inside (Figure 1.9.15): kick the lower 
belly from the unexpected inside, as low as 
allowed by the rules.

FRONT KICKS   35
Self-defense
When attacked by a front kick in matching stances, retreat with the front leg to get just out of range and control the kick. 
If possible, “pull” the kicking leg a little to cause your opponent to over-extend himself and be slightly off -balance when 
he lands forward (Figure 1.9.20). Immediately rebound forward with a rear-leg front kick. As he falls with his side facing 
you, an outward-tilted front kick, preferably to the groin, will catch him unawares (Figure 1.9.21). Chamber the leg back 
while using the front hand to hit his face and then go down to control his forward arm (Figure 1.9.22). Lower the leg 
while reverse punching him (Figure 1.9.23).

1.10 The Inward-tilted Front Kick
General
Th is is the mirror image of the previous kick: a front kick with a change in trajectory at the end, this time from outside 
inwards. Th is kick could be considered a hybrid of the front kick and the well-known small roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, 
Section 2). Again, this is not a very powerful kick, but it is surprising to an opponent who stands very much on his 
side and feels protected from straight kicks. Well executed, this is a very eff ective kick, although the eff ect of surprise is 
somewhat less than with the outward tilted front kick: a kick coming from the outside inwards is always more expected 
than the other way around.  
Description
Th e kick starts with a regular straight high knee chambering (Figure 1.10.2). While developing the kick, the leg tilts mildly 
outward and the foot turns inward (Figure 1.10.3). Th e trajectory of the front kick changes slightly to allow the ball of the 
foot to connect from outside inward. Again, the whole feeling of the kick is of a front kick, and not a roundhouse.

36   CHAPTER ONE
Typical Application
Again, it is wise, before executing this technique, to get the opponent used to 
seeing regular front kicks. Th is technique is especially useful to score against opponents 
in opposite stance (other foot forward) and who stand very much on their side to give 
as little target as possible. Lunge with a lead jab/reverse punch combination, but make 
sure you hit slightly toward the outside of your opponent’s head (Figure 1.10.11 and 
1.10.12). Make sure you keep your fi st on the outside of his face a few seconds more than 
necessary, while you chamber your back leg for an inward-tilted front kick. Develop 
the kick while keeping the upper body as relaxed as possible, so as not to betray your 
intentions. Th is kick is faster and much less telegraphed than a roundhouse. 
Try to hit as low as possible within the rules. See Figure 1.10.14.
Figure 1.10.10

kick is difﬁ cult to block.

the kick.
Key Points
Lift  the knee straight and high like 
• 
any regular front kick.
Hit with the ball of the foot.
• 
Targets
Solar plexus, lower ribs, groin.
In point tournaments, you 
should try to hit as low as possible 
within the rules: above the groin, 
but just below or on the belt. Well 
executed, it is very diffi  cult to block 
(Figure 1.10.10).

FRONT KICKS   37
Specific Training
Accuracy is very important: mark the heavy bag on the side, at your belt’s level. 
• 
Kick fast, while concentrating on bursting out without telegraphing any move.
• 
Self-defense
Th e inward-tilted front kick is the kick of choice when you fi nd yourself slightly on the outside of your assailant. 
For example, if grabbed by the hair from behind (Figure 1.10.15), press both hands forcefully on your assailant’s hands 
and pivot under his arm and slightly 
outside (Figure 1.10. 16). You can 
release your head because of the 
lock on your opponent’s arm and 
kick his groin from the outside with 
an inward-tilted front kick (Figure 
1.10.17). Lower the kicking leg and 
immediately deliver a roundhouse 
kick, regular or preferably straight-
legged, to his exposed back at 
kidneys level (Figure 1.10.18).
1.11 The Foot Blade Front Kick
Mae sokuto geri (karate)
General
Th is is very simply a regular front kick, penetrating or upward, that connects with the blade of the foot (Sokuto, or Ashi 
gatana in Japanese) instead of the ball of the foot. It requires turning the foot inward during the development of the kick, 
but the basics of the kick are just like a regular kick. Th is is an excellent way to execute the front kick as a stop-kick, 
as it is quicker than a side kick executed with the same “foot blade.” Th is is also a good technique for those who kick 
more slowly in a real fi ght, because of a subconscious fear of hurting their toes.
Description
Chamber the knee as usual with a regular front kick 
(Figure 1.11.2). Only when the leg is extended and 
the kick develops do the foot and the hip start to turn 
inward (Figures 1.11.3 and 1.11.4). Th e kick connects 
with the edge (the “blade”) of the foot, just as the hips 
fi nish their push forward, and the leg retracts to the 
knee-high chambered position.

38   CHAPTER ONE
Typical Application
As mentioned, this is a typical stop-
kick, fast to execute from the front or 
the rear leg. Figures 1.11.11 through 
1.11.13 illustrate the foot blade front 
kick as a rear-leg stop to a lunge punch.
Specific Training
It is important to familiarize oneself 
with the kick by hitting a real target, 
like a heavy bag.
Self-defense
Th e following images illustrate a front leg stop kick, against a high roundhouse. You are threatened by an assailant with 
obvious martial arts training. Retreat into a fi ghting stance to keep your distance (Figure 1.11.14). When your opponent 
starts developing a high roundhouse kick (Figure 1.11.15), close the distance as needed with a short hop of the rear leg, 
while chambering the knee for a foot blade front kick to his open groin area (Figure 1.11.16). Follow-up with a knee 
strike to the pulled-down head (Figures 1.11.17 and 1.11.18). You can slip to his outside for a hook kick to the back of 
the head with the same leg that just kneed him (Figure 1.11.19).
Figure 1.11.18

Key Points
Push the hips forward, like a 
• 
regular front kick, while turning 
them simultaneously slightly 
inward to allow the pivoting of 
the foot itself
It is a straight kick.
• 
Targets
It is generally a stop-kick; therefore 
the lower abdomen and the ribs are 
prime targets.
Th e way the kick is delivered 
allows also for high front kicks, 
to the throat for example.

 
FRONT KICKS   39
1.12 The Oblique Front Kick
General
Th is is a regular front kick, but delivered about 45 degrees on your inside, while pivoting on the standing foot. Th e kick 
is described here because of the exhaustive nature of this chapter. All skilled martial artists know kicks can be fi red 
from various angles during a fi ght. Th e practice of this kick is an important training building block toward profi ciency 
in kicking in all situations. As will be described in the Typical Application subsection that follows, this kick is extremely 
effi  cient in scoring a full power front kick to an adversary presenting a very closed guard, with his side toward you; 
or to an adversary trying to evade you on the outside. 
Description
It is useful to practice the kick 
aft er a small step with the front 
leg. Chamber the knee high and 
straight, just like a regular front kick 
(Figure 1.12.3). While extending the 
leg, pivot inward on the standing 
foot (Figure 1.12.4). Th e kick is 
delivered straight, exactly like a 
regular front kick. Pull the leg back 
before landing the foot.

Figure 1.12.11
These images show the oblique front kick being used after evading a penetrating front kick.
Key Points
Turn on the standing foot aft er raising the knee, so as not 
to telegraph your move.
Targets
Typical targets for the heel front kick include the solar 
plexus, ribs, and groin.

40   CHAPTER ONE
Typical Application
Your opponent is in a very closed guard (Figure 1.12.12), with his side toward you, and initiates a full-step lunge punch. 
Do a quick lunge step forward at 45 degrees to your inside (Figure 1.12.13). Immediately chamber the knee of the rear 
leg while pivoting back toward your opponent, from an angle this time (Figure 1.12.14). Kick (Figure 1.12.15). 
Th e step and pivot must be sudden and fast as they put you momentarily in a dangerous position. Th e best way to 
initiate such a kick is presented in the images that follow: for an opponent with same foot forward, initiate a lunge punch 
to his face while stepping 
in and forward (Figure 
1.12.17). Keep your fi st 
in front of his eyes while 
pivoting and kicking to his 
open ribs (Figure 1.12.18). 
If possible, take control of 
his blocking hand.
Specific Training
Hit the heavy bag when facing 45 degrees from it.
• 
Kick a partner evading a jab from your outside.
•

Figure 1.12.23
Deﬂ ect an incoming kick, spinning your opponent to the outside, and then follow up with an oblique front kick to his kidney. Finish off the 
confrontation with a stomp to the back of his knee.
Self-defense
Th e same principles are valid when dealing with a kick. Suppose your opponent throws you a front kick. Th e technique 
stays basically the same, whichever leg he uses to kick you. You block his kick at its maximum with an outside “spoon” 
block (Sukui-uke—karate): sweep his leg to the outside while catching its underside (Figure 1.12.20). Th en lift  slightly 
and pull the leg toward you and your outside, in order to overextend your opponent and put him off -balance. Th e catch 
is very short: release his leg and he lands in an overextended stance, half-way with his back toward you (Figure 1.12.21). 
In order to deliver a powerful front kick from your rear leg into his exposed kidneys, you’ll need to perform an oblique 
front kick (Figure 1.12.22). You can fi nish him off  with a stomp kick into the back of his knee (Figure 1.12.23). Note that 
had he kicked you with his other leg, the same technique would have brought him to you off -balance and with his front 
open to your oblique kick!

 
FRONT KICKS   41
1.13 The Instep Angular Front (Lotus) Kick
Sokuchi geri (ninjutsu), Lotus kick (common name), Ponteira lateral (capoeira)
General
Sometimes called the lotus kick, this is a true hybrid between an upward front kick and an outside crescent kick. It is 
basically a very short outside crescent kick that starts from a front kick chambered knee. An outside crescent kick starts 
from the fl oor with an extended leg and makes a large circular movement in order to gain the centrifugal speed that will 
give it its power. Th e instep angular front kick is much less powerful, but very fast and surprising. As it climbs up very 
close to the opponent’s body, it is rather undetectable until it is too late. Because of its lack of power, it needs to be aimed 
at the soft  spots of the head. Th e kick is not to be mistaken for the inward-tilted front kick, which is not a straight leg kick.
Th is kick is one of those kicks suitable for close combat, because of its short range and surprising eff ect. Most people 
do not expect to be kicked at close range.
Although the classic kick is delivered with the rear leg, such a delivery is detrimental to the element of surprise. 
It will therefore be described in the application examples as a fast front leg kick.
Description
Bring the rear knee to chambered 
position, while turning the foot 
inward (Figure 1.13.2). Straighten 
the leg while keeping the straight 
upward movement (Figure 
1.13.3). Start pushing the leg out, 
like an outside crescent kick, but 
only when the leg is straight and 
close to the target (Figure 1.13.4). 
Hit with the blade and the top of 
the foot. Chamber the knee back 
(Figure 1.13.5).

The instep angular front kick can be used in close combat as well.

42   CHAPTER ONE
Key Points
Keep the upper body straight, relaxed and as immobile 
as possible, so as not to telegraph your movement. 
Th e leg travels outside the vision range of your opponent! 
Th is kick is about speed and surprise.
Targets
Th e head and its soft  points: chin, temples, ears, 
• 
and nose.
Th e lower ribs if the opponent is open and extended.
• 
Should your opponent be in the same stance as you, punch to the inside of his face and kick him from his outside.
Specific Training
Hit the heavy bag when starting from a fi ghting stance in which your 
• 
front hand touches the bag (Figure 1.13.17). Practice rear leg and 
front leg kicking (Figure 1.13.18).
Practice the kick while chambering over a chair. 
• 
Self-defense
Evade to the outside of a reverse punching assailant, while controlling 
the punch with your lead hand (Figure 1.13.20). Lift  the knee of the 
front leg and deliver the instep angular front kick to his open ribs 
(Figure 1.13.21). Hit with the tip of the shoe into the lower ribs. 
It would be natural to conclude the technique with a low side kick 
into his inside knee! See Figure 1.13.22.

Figure 1.13.13 
Figure 1.13.14 
Figure 1.13.15 
Figure 1.13.16
Distract your opponent before delivering a surprise instep angular front kick.
Typical Application
Th is is a very surprising kick for use when you are close to your opponent, and the skilled artist can score many points 
with it. If your opponent is in opposite stance, jab to the outside of his face to force him to over-block and keep his 
attention there. In this example, the outside jab comes in a continuous deceiving movement starting toward his groin 
(Figures 1.13.12 and 1.13.13). Keep your hand on the outside of his face while delivering your instep angular front kick 
with your front leg to the other side of his face (Figure 1.13.15). As he is very close, once the kick is delivered, chamber 
back, and be ready to punch him in the face with your front palm, for example (Figure 1.13.16).

FRONT KICKS   43
1.14 The Switch Front Kick
General
Th is is again a kick that is presented here because of the exhaustive nature of this chapter. Th e experienced martial artist 
is aware of, and profi cient in, the diff erent patterns of footwork, which are applicable to all kinds of kicks. Th e switch 
front kick is simply a regular front kick, generally penetrating, but executed aft er a switch of the legs, made more or less 
in place where you are standing. Th e kick allows for the use of the front leg of your stance, while having the power of 
a rear-leg kick—the best of both worlds! Of course, this is not a kick to use in pursuit of a retreating opponent. It is in 
fact a stop-kick par excellence. It is an extremely powerful kick, not only because of the rear leg power, but also because 
the kicking leg that is brought backward rebounds off  the fl oor for the kicking motion. It also is a surprising kick, as the 
switching legs will baffl  e your opponent.
During the small hop to switch legs, the distance must be adapted to the circumstances: on the same spot, a little 
closer to the opponent, or a little further away if the opponent is approaching quickly.
Description
From the fi ghting stance (Figure 1.14.1), hop 
as close to the fl oor as possible, and switch legs 
fast, while adjusting for distance (Figures 1.14.2 
and 1.14.3). Th e kicking foot, formerly of the 
lead leg, rebounds off  the fl oor, and lift s up 
to its high-knee chambered position. Kick as 
usual, preferably a penetrating or heel front kick 
(Figure 1.14.4). Recoil the leg and lower foot.
Figures 1.14.5 through 1.14.8 show the delivery of the kick, in place. Th e height of the jump is exaggerated in the photos!
Key Points
Suppress unnecessary upper body movement.
• 
Stability and a strong foundation while kicking is of the 
• 
utmost importance. Foot switch as close to the fl oor as 
possible—there is no jumping up. 
 
Targets
Th is is a stop-kick. Th e lower abdomen, ribs and solar 
plexus are typical targets, although the face is another 
possible target.

Figure 1.14. 6

Figure 1.14.1 
Figure 1.14. 2 
Figure 1.14. 3 
Figure 1.14.4
Side view of the switch front kick.
Typical Application
As a stop kick, it is nearly applicable to all attacks launched with a high forward momentum. It is an excellent technique 
to launch aft er a few exaggerated retreats. Your opponent will expect you to fl ee backward again, and will fi nd you much 
closer before he can develop his attack to a viable momentum. For example, in Figures 1.14.9 through 1.14.13, We show 

44   CHAPTER ONE

The switch front kick is an excellent stop kick that can be effectively used to surprise an opponent whom you’ve lulled into expecting a retreat.
such a move on an opponent seeking to close the distance with a long lunge jab, to set up his favorite spinning hook kick. 
Switch legs while he lunges, moving slightly backward, and kick his back while he still rotates to prepare his spinning 
kick. You can then punch him with the lead hand while landing, or grab him and sweep the leg on which he is standing.
1.15 The Lift Kick
Scoop kick (common name, jeet kune do)
General
Th is is a deceptively simple kick typical of the soft  styles of kung fu. Th is is a very simple lift  of the leg that targets, 
because of its lack of power, only soft  targets: mainly the groin, and sometimes the sacrum. Th is is a close range kick, 
which must be delivered swift ly and with no telegraphing moves in order to be eff ective.
Specific Training
Mark a spot on the fl oor and practice the kick while trying for the three possible distance adjustments while switching: 
on the spot, as backward as possible, as forward as possible.
As with all stop-kicks: get a training partner to lunge toward you with protective gear or a padded target.
Self-defense
Th e switch front kick is also a great move to evade an attack on the low front leg—a sweep or a front kick, for example. 
If you switch while your opponent develops his sweep (or kick), he will miss your front leg, and probably the other one 
too. Even if he connects with the switched previously rear leg, it will not be where he expected it to be: the impact will be 
weaker and your opponent will be off -balance. Figure 1.14.15 illustrates a fully committed sweep into the void while you 
switch and deliver a powerful penetrating kick to your off -balance assailant (Figure 1.14.16). In this example, you then 
land on his outside, and deliver a hook kick to the back of his head (Figure 1.14.18).
Figure 1.14.14

Figure 1.14.16

Figure 1.14.18
Switch your legs to interrupt your opponent’s attempted leg sweep, and follow up with a penetrating front kick. End the confrontation with a hook kick 
to the back of your opponent’s head.

 
FRONT KICKS   45
Description
See Figures 1.15.1 through 1.15.3. In a fi ghting stance with 
more weight on the back leg (Ko kutsu dachi—karate), 
simply raise the front leg—as it is, with no chambering—
into your opponent’s groin.
Figures 1.15.4 and 1.15.5 show the way the kick is 
executed, with as little telegraphing as possible.
Figure 1.15.4 
Figure 1.15.5
To be effective, this simple kick must not be telegraphed.
Key Points
Th e eff ectiveness of the kick lies with the surprise eff ect: 
• 
disguise as much as possible the fact that your weight is 
on your rear leg and that the front leg is “weightless.”
Avoid any telegraphing move: don’t look at the target and 
• 
keep the upper body relaxed and still during the kick.
Targets
Typical targets include the groin, from the front or 
• 
the back. 
Sometimes the sacrum.
• 
Typical Application
Evade a step-through punch on the outside (Figure 1.15.8), pivot and lift -kick to your opponent’s sacrum or testicles 
from behind (Figure 1.15.9).
Specific Training
Work on a heavy bag hung at a level where the bottom hangs at groin level. 
• 
Practice with a totally relaxed upper body. 
• 
Train in front of the mirror to check for “tell tales.”
•

Side view of the lift kick.

46   CHAPTER ONE
Self-defense
You are being challenged from very close. Retreat obliquely on your assailant’s inside with one leg while controlling his 
lead hand (or blocking his punch). See Figure 1.15.11. Immediately lift  the front leg, now “weightless” because of your 
rear step, into his groin (Figure 1.15.12). You can hammerfi st the back of his neck as he bends forward from the pain of 
the kick, while moving away (Figure 1.15.13).
1.16 The Phantom Groin Kick
General
Th is is also a close-range groin kick, with eff ectiveness reliant upon the surprise of a “no-clues” delivery. In fact, 
this is a version of the previous lift  kick, but for even closer-range fi ghting. When in a close-quarters scuffl  e, simply 
lift  the front foot from where it is directly into your opponent’s groin, bending the leg as much as needed to adjust 
for distance. As with the lift  kick, there should be no glancing at the target and no upper body move that would hint 
at the coming kick.
Th is kick appears, in our opinion, in one of the most traditional of Shotokan-ryu karate katas: Tekki shodan, a form 
entirely performed in a very low horse stance, on a straight line, as if with one’s back to a wall. Th ere are, of course, 
several possible interpretations (bunkai) of this move in the kata, but one of them is a phantom groin kick, delivered 
forward with no preceding body or leg movement. See Figures 1.16.1 through 1.16.6.

Evade the punch while shifting your weight to your back leg, and then ﬂ ick this kick into the opponent’s groin. 
Follow up with a ﬁ st to your opponent’s head while he’s doubled over from the kick.
Description
For the kick from a regular stance, see Figures 1.16.7 though 1.16.11. For a (higher) close-range fi ghting stance, simply 
lift  the front foot to groin level while bending the knee and turning it outwards.

 
FRONT KICKS   47
Typical Application
Th is is obviously a kick for very close-range fi ghting. 
If you get very close to your opponent and exchange 
punches, just lift  the closest leg to his groin (Figure 
1.16.16), while keeping his attention riveted to hand 
control. You can follow up with an elbow strike 
(Figure 1.16.17).
Specific Training
Work on a heavy bag hung at a level where the bottom hangs at groin level.
• 
Practice delivering the kick without telegraphing. 
• 
Practice in front of a mirror.
• 
Work on hip fl exibility exercises. For example: yoga’s cobbler’s pose (See Figure 1.16.18).
• 
Drill for speed, explosiveness and power on a padded target held by a partner at groin 
• 
level. See Figures 1.16.19 and 1.16.20 for a rear leg version.

• 
attention on your hands.
Targets

• 
Th e face of a bent-over opponent.

48   CHAPTER ONE
Self-defense
Th is is obviously a kick of choice for many self-defense situations. Remember: not telegraphing is key to success. Do not 
look at a target and keep your upper body relaxed. When attacked with a front choke, lift  your joined hands in between 
your attacker’s arms (Figure 1.16.21). Hit his right arm up and out, while lift ing your foot to his groin (Figure 1.16.22). 
Hit his left  arm with a full twist of the hips for power (Figure 1.16.23), and twist back with a hand strike to his face or 
neck, preferably a hand knife-edge strike (Shuto-uchi—karate). See Figure 1.16.24. Continue the twist of the hips in a 
powerful straight-leg roundhouse (Chapter 3, Section 7) to his ribs (Figure 1.16.25), and twist back with an elbow strike 
to the face (1.16.26).
1.17 The Drop Front Kick
Chapa no chão (capoeira)
General
Th e dynamic version of this kick, from a standing position, is described here. Th e front kick from the fl oor, though very 
similar, is beyond the scope of this book.
Th is is a very surprising kick, and very powerful if delivered correctly. Japanese styles are generally not fond of 
sacrifi cing power and balance by going down to the fl oor, but whoever has met a capoerista understands how tricky it is 
to deal with a seasoned fi ghter hovering close to the ground.

FRONT KICKS   49
Description
Although the execution of this kick is conceivable while going forward, it is more logical as a kick against an advancing 
opponent. Th erefore, it will be described here as such. For the sake of deception, it is useful to start from a high fi ghting 
stance (Figure 1.17.1). Step back from your fi ghting stance and shift  your body weight to your rear leg (Figure 1.17.2). 
Flex the legs while planting your rear hand on the fl oor behind you. Only then, plant the other hand on the fl oor behind 
you while you lift  the knee for a regular penetrating front kick (Figure 1.17.3). Extend the leg while pushing with the 
hips for extra power (Figure 1.17.4). Connect with the heel or the ball of the foot and chamber the leg back immediately. 
Of course, once you are familiar with the execution of the kick, you can literally drop, falling down directly into 
chambered position, as in the application described in the Self-defense section to follow.

50   CHAPTER ONE
Key Points
While going down, keep your front hand in front of you for defense.
• 
Th e push of the hips is at its maximum, just as the foot connects.
• 
Targets
Of course the knee and the groin are the primary targets. Th e ribs and solar plexus are also in range. And if the opponent 
bends toward you, do not hesitate to target the throat, chin and face.
Typical Application
It is, of course an excellent kick when confronting an overpowering opponent running forward with high attacks. 
You just disappear suddenly from his line of sight while he cannot stop his forward momentum. We present the example 
of a high-kicking opponent, storming forward with no control of his roundhouse/spinning back hook kick combination, 
and getting kicked in his open groin. See Figures 1.17.10 through 1.17.12.

Figure 1.17.15
Drop down and back into a chambered position as you avoid the swing of your opponent’s weapon, and then launch your kick.
Specific Training
Practice, practice and practice, for speed.
• 
Power: execute the kick on the heavy bag, from a fi ghting stance positioned with your body touching the bag.
• 
Practice “falling” down into chambered position.
• 
Self-defense
Th e example presented here is less technical, as can be expected in real life. You are suddenly attacked with a downward 
circular short stick attack to the head, and you try to evade the strike by going backward. You do not have the time to 
step back and put the hand on the fl oor, so you just let yourself drop into the chambering position (Figure 1.17.14). 
Your attacker will be surprised by your change of plane, and you will be able to kick his groin (Figure 1.17.15), and later 
follow up with other ground kicking techniques.

 
FRONT KICKS   51
1.18 The Drop Twin Front Kick
General
Again, we will describe here the dynamic version of this kick that can be also delivered as a static kick from a ground 
position. Th e drop twin front kick is the two-legged version of the drop front kick described in the previous section. 
It is also a surprising kick and is highly suitable to deal with an opponent who overly commits himself to forward 
movement. Th e kick is very much used in, and typical of, exotic kung fu styles like the Monkey and Drunken style.
Description
From a high fi ghting stance (Figure 1.18.1), step back while swift ly lowering your body weight onto the retreating leg 
(Figure 1.18.2). Place the rear hand on the fl oor behind you while keeping your front hand in guard. Place your front 
hand on the fl oor behind you while 
sitting on your buttocks and lift ing 
your cocked knees (Figure 1.18.3). 
Extend your legs powerfully, while 
pushing from your hands and 
involving as much hip thrust as 
possible (Figure 1.18.4). 
Figures 1.18.5 through 1.18.7 show 
an application of the kick, against a 
front kick, when downed. Figures 1.18.8 through 1.18.11 show the delivery of the kick against a high roundhouse kick.

52   CHAPTER ONE
Figure 1.18.13 
Figure 1.18.14 
Figure 1.18.15 
Figure 1.18.16
Key Points
Keep your front hand up as long as possible.
• 
Your buttocks should “rebound” from the fl oor: the forward thrust comes immediately as you sit on the fl oor.
• 
Targets
Primary targets are the groin, solar plexus, ribs, and knees. Figure 1.18.12 shows the use of the kick against the inner 
thigh of a kicking opponent.
Figure 1.18.12
If you’re not conﬁ dent that you can reach your opponent’s groin, aim your kick at his inner thigh instead.
Typical Application
Th e premise of this situation is that you are being attacked by an opponent with an overwhelming barrage of punches. 
He is blasting forward with alternating punches to the head. Th is is a good move if you have been caught off -guard 
with the fi rst punch and need to take back the initiative. You go back under the fl urry of punches, and then suddenly 
drop down, preferably directly on your butt and hands, without passing through the classical intermediate position 
(see Figure 1.18.15). Double kick your opponent in the lower abdomen while he still has forward momentum 
(Figure 1.18.17). Although he impales himself on your feet, you still have to kick forcefully from the chambered 
position. Once he has been stopped, you must keep the off ensive by kicking from the ground, at least until it is safe 
to quickly stand up without danger. For example, pivot onto your knee while you chamber the other leg for a ground 
side kick (Figure 1.18.18). Figure 1.18.19 depicts a kick to the body, but kicks to the knees and groin are easier and 
more eff ective.

 
FRONT KICKS   53
Specific Training
Practice the drop for speed. Practice with and without the intermediate position.
• 
Start from a fi ghting stance in which you touch the heavy bag. Deliver for power.
• 
Practice with a padded lunging partner.
• 
Self-defense
Th is is a perfect kick to execute when an assailant pushes you. Instead of resisting a push, drop down and let him push 
into the air and get off -balance. For example: an assailant has been pushing you, or has tried to, once (Figure 1.18.20). 
You retreat, but he again shows the intention of lunging at you (Figure 1.18.21). As he comes toward you, punching or 
pushing, you drop down, preferably directly into chambered position (Figure 1.18.22). Double kick into his forward 
momentum, in the abdomen or preferably the groin (Figure 1.18.23). You then roll on yourself and lie on your side, 
while hooking your foot behind his forward ankle, from the outside. Th en you side kick or roundhouse kick the knee 
of his hooked ankle with a punishing joint kick (Figure 1.18.24). If necessary, keep kicking from the fl oor. Do not stand 
up before your assailant is disabled or out of range—you are more vulnerable while standing up.

54   CHAPTER ONE
More Advanced Front Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are beyond 
the scope of this book.
The Double Front Kick
Th is is a classic way to deliver two front kicks in quick succession with the same leg, usually low, then high. 
The Double Front Kick Combination
Th is is also a classic exercise, and the combination is very eff ective in combat. Th is is front leg front kick followed by 
a front kick by the other leg, switching legs virtually in the air. 
The Flying Front Kick
Th is is the easiest of fl ying kicks, and can be delivered 
by jumping high or jumping far. Th is is simply a front kick 
leg delivery, but with forward momentum added 
by jumping. 
The Double Flying Front Kick Combination
Th is is a very classic and extremely eff ective combination, 
which is surprising and overpowering. It is recommended 
against a “fl eeing” opponent who retreats quickly when 
you start an attack. It allows you to cover a lot of distance 
while delivering extremely powerful kicks. Again, it can 
be practiced jumping high or jumping far. Th e kick could 
also be considered fi rst and foremost as a double kick.
The Roundhouse-chambered Front Kick
Th is is a great feint kick, and very successful when well delivered: make sure that your opponent expects a roundhouse 
kick by throwing a few half-hearted roundhouses. You then chamber the leg as a full roundhouse kick, start to deliver as 
a roundhouse, but progressively with the delivery, switch to a full hipped penetrating front kick. 
The Soccer Low Front Kick
Th is is a very fast kick, diffi  cult to block and extremely 
painful in self-defense situations. You simply kick in front of 
you, to your opponent’s tibia, without chambering. Th is is 
the low kick par excellence, and is very useful as a stop kick.
The Low Front Kick
Simple and eff ective, this is a front kick with little 
chambering aimed at the legs, generally the lower leg. 
The High Chambered Low (Stomp) Front Kick
Th e high chambered front kick delivered to the legs.
The Ground Front Kick
Th is is a front kick leg delivery, from a prone position, 
very much like the front drop kick. 
A double ﬂ ying front kick.
A ground front kick.

CHAPTER TWO
Side Kicks
Th e side kick is generally considered the most powerful of all kicks, its impact having been measured by 
sports researchers. Most will remember the scene in Bruce Lee’s “Way of the Dragon,” in the backyard of 
the restaurant, where his side kick sends his body shield-holding partner fl ying back in the air. Th is is the 
kind of power a well-delivered side kick creates. 
 Side kicks are slower to deliver than front kicks and require serious training. Th ey will need a lot of 
drilling, but will teach the beginner to coordinate body and legs for power optimization. Side kicks allow 
for power and safe delivery and therefore exist in all styles and methods. Th e most important variations 
will be presented here: kicking with diff erent footwork patterns, diff erent targets, along diff erent 
trajectories and with diff erent emphasis of delivery.  
 2.1 The Penetrating Side Kick
 Yoko geri kekomi (Shotokan karate), Sokuto geri (Wado-ryu karate), Yop tshagy / Yup cha tzirugi (taekwondo), Tshuai thui 
/ Juk tek / Jek tshan / Bang jiao (kung fu), Cruzado / Pisão / Chapa (capoeira), Bang thiet cuoc / Song cuoc (viet vo dao), 
Chassé (savate–boxe française), Tendangan rusuk (pencak silat), Teep khang (muay thai). 
General
Th e side kick is the most powerful kick of all, thanks to the necessary alignment between the leg and the body in a well- 
delivered kick. Because the kicking leg and the upper body are on one line during the kick, the hips can transmit the 
whole body power to the kick. No wonder it is a main kick of all existing systems. It is the preferred kick of Bruce Lee’s 
jeet kune do, especially in its front leg version with the opponent’s knee as a target. Because of its power and stability, 
it is also the most eff ective stop-kick, but with some slight diff erences in execution. It is interesting to note that the 
chambering part of the kick, with its pivoting on the standing foot, is in itself a block against an incoming kick or punch, 
from which the developing side kick becomes a counterattack (see Self-defense in Section 2.7)
A penetrating side kick. (M. De Bremaeker)

60   CHAPTER T WO
Figures 2.1.9 through 2.1.11 show the execution of the kick mid-level from one side. 
You connect preferably with the edge of the foot, but the plant of the foot and the heel are also acceptable. See Figure 2.1.8.

Figure 2.1.10 
Figure 2.1.11
These images show a mid-level penetrating side kick in action.
Description
See Figures 2.1.1 through 2.1.4, which depict the rear leg version. Lift  the rear knee forward while pivoting 90 degrees 
on the front foot. Your side is toward the target, and you extend the leg while pushing the hips and aligning your upper 
body and your leg. Immediately aft er impact, recoil the leg to the chambered position and pivot back toward your 
opponent while lowering your kicking foot in front or back to the rear.

Side view of the penetrating side kick (rear leg version).

 
SIDE KICKS   61
Key Points
I cannot overstate that the kick is delivered with the 
• 
hips, and body and leg are in a straight line.
Th e standing foot is fl at on the fl oor: no raising the heel.
• 
Chamber back quickly: the position you are in at 
• 
impact, if your leg gets caught, is very dangerous as 
your opponent can have full access to your front, 
or worse, your back!
Targets
Th e entire abdomen is a target: ribs, solar plexus, 
• 
lower belly, underarm, kidneys, and lower back.
Of course, the knee.
• 
Th e throat is a possible (lethal) target.
• 
Figures 2.1.12 through 2.1.14 show the kick delivered to a high level, as a stop-kick, and viewed from the opposite angle.
Figure 2.1.12 
Figure 2.1.13 
Figure 2.1.14
These images show a high-level penetrating side kick in action.
Specific Training
Th is being a powerful kick, it must be practiced a lot on the heavy bag. Work from farther and farther away and 
• 
explode into the kick.
Deliver the kick over a chair on your side (Figures 2.1.19 and 2.1.20) and in front of you (see Figures 2.1.21 and 
• 
2.1.22), to force the necessary high chambering of the kick.
Figure 2.1.15 
Figure 2.1.16 
Figure 2.1.17 
Figure 2.1.18
The hard-to-block penetrating side kick is facilitated by and a short hop.
Typical Application
Although the kick from the rear leg may seem cumbersome at fi rst glance, this author has found it an extremely 
successful kick for tournament scoring. Aft er a lot of training, it becomes nearly impossible to block this kick, especially 
with a little hopping movement and if aimed at the lowest point of the belly allowed, usually the belt itself. Close the 
distance with a lunge and a high front/reverse punch combination (Figure 2.1.15), while using the hip turn of the reverse 
punch to “liberate” the rear leg and start the chambering of the knee (Figures 2.1.16 and 2.1.17). Hop slightly to close 
more distance if necessary, while chambering and kick (Figure 2.1.18).

62   CHAPTER T WO
Practice the kick a lot from the ground with and without weighted ankles, until the burn is unbearable. Th is will 
• 
develop all the important small muscles in the hip that are diffi  cult to develop otherwise.
Flexibility is key—practice all types of splits! Flexibility drills with a partner will be very helpful.
• 
Drill for penetration power on padded target held by partner. See Figure 2.1.23 through 2.1.25.

Self-defense
Avoid a circular stick attack by retreating and leaning back (Figure 2.1.31). As soon as the stick has passed through, 
regain a forward momentum, now to the outside of your assailant while he still is carried away by his attack (Figure 
2.1.32). Chamber the rear leg and side kick his ribs from his outside (Figure 2.1.33). Lower the leg directly into the back 
of his knee (Figure 2.1.34).

2.2 The Upward Side Kick
Yoko geri keage (Shotokan karate), Yup cha ohlligi (taekwondo)
General
Just as with the upward front kick/penetrating front kick comparison, this is the upward variation of the side kick: 
the hips are used much less in the kick, and the kick connects from down under upwards, usually with the armpit, 
the arm, the bent body or the chin. Of course, there are many variations and nuances of the side kick, with more or less 
“penetration” versus “upward-ness.” Th e upward side kick is very fast, and quite painful when it hits the right targets. 
It is used, among other purposes, to disturb your opponent’s guard by attacking the joints of the arms.
Surprisingly, it is the upward version of the side kick that is found in traditional karate katas: two examples are shown 
in the two kata excerpts that follow (Figures 2.2.1 through 2.2.10), from very basic Shatokan-ryu karate forms.
A straight leg version of this kick is sometimes called a “pendulum kick.”

64   CHAPTER T WO
Description
Th e preparatory steps before the kick itself are identical to those of the penetrating side kick. Raise the knee and pivot 
sideways to your opponent (Figure 2.2.12). From there on though, the trajectory of the foot changes and you extend the 
leg upward, without pushing with the hips (Figure 2.2.13). Aft er hitting your target from below, with the blade of the 
foot, chamber back immediately (Figure 2.2.14). Th e kick can, of course, be delivered with the front leg also (See the 
following section).

Figure 2.2.15
This is the part of the foot that makes contact 
during the execution of an upward side kick.
Figures 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 show the 
delivery of the kick to the armpit of 
a controlled arm. Notice that less 
hip thrust is needed in the upward 
version of the side kick.
Key Points
Lift  the knee high.
• 
In this kick, the upward 
• 
development of the leg can start 
before the knee is fully chambered: 
as the momentum is upward, the 
end of the knee lift  and the start of 
the upward leg movement should be simultaneous.
Th e standing foot stays fl at on the fl oor.
• 
Targets
Only from down upwards: chin, arms, bent body or head. Th e armpit is a favorite, especially if you can get a hold of your 
opponent’s hand and keep his arm up and extended.
Typical Application
As mentioned, this is an ideal kick to attack the arms or the guard of an opponent, especially if he tends to stand in 
high guard. It is surprising and painful and can open the opponent just long enough to allow for a more serious attack 
to go through. It is a great kick to hit a punch on its way to you, from below, although usually this is reserved for its 
front leg form. Here is an application that exemplifi es the guard-opening angle: reverse punch to your opponent’s face, 
while developing the upward side kick from your rear leg. Hit your opponent’s elbow from below to open his guard and 
deliver pain (Figure 2.2.19). Chamber and immediately deliver a penetrating side kick to the unguarded ribs, if possible, 
without lowering the foot to the fl oor (Figure 2.2.21). If not possible, lower the foot and rebound off  the fl oor to deliver 
the second kick, as illustrated. You can follow up by lowering your kicking foot behind his front leg, getting a hold of his 
shoulder or collar, and sweep him to the ground (O soto gari—judo). See Figure 2.2.22.
Figure 2.2.16 
Figure 2.2.17
Less hip thrust is necessary for the upward side kick.

 
SIDE KICKS   65
Specific Training
Th is kick must be delivered precisely—therefore it should be practiced with a partner holding a target mitt facing 
• 
down at arm and chin level.
Kick over a chair beside you or in front of you, just like with the penetrating side kick (refer to Figures 2.1.19 through 
• 
2.1.22 in the previous section)
Practice the whole 
• 
Heian Nidan and Heian Yodan katas, or the sequences described previously.
Squat and kick (refer to Figures 2.1.26 through 2.1.29 in the previous section).
• 
Stand on one leg and hold the other foot close to the belt knot, with the bent leg parallel to the fl oor. Pull on the ankle, 
• 
and then explosively release the leg around the knee, as if in a low kick, in a typical keage upward movement.
Work on your fl exibility. For example, side leg raises while holding a dancing bar.
• 
Self-defense
When suddenly attacked, you lift  your arms, but your assailant gets a hold of your sleeve (Figure 2.2.23). Immediately 
chamber your front leg and try to get a hold of his hand to control it (Figure 2.2.24). Hit your assailant’s extended arm 
or armpit from below (Figure 2.2.25)—this will be painful in any case, but if you have immobilized his hand, it will 
also damage the elbow joint. Keep control of his arm by catching his wrist with your front hand while you deliver a 
penetrating side kick with the same leg, directly from the chamber position, or aft er rebounding off  the fl oor. Pull his 
arm toward you while kicking (Figure 2.2.27). You can follow up with a full-powered straight leg roundhouse to his 
exposed ribs (as you have kept pulling his arm). See Figure 2.2.28.

66   CHAPTER T WO
2.3 The Front Leg Side Kick
Surikonde yoko geri (karate), Pisaõ crusado (capoeira)
General
Th e front leg version of the side kick is one of the bread-and-butter kicks of martial arts: fast, powerful and relatively 
easy and safe to deliver. It is less powerful than the rear leg version, but faster, and with the added advantage of guarding 
the body during delivery: the chambered leg keeps the side of the body covered, and there is always the leg between you 
and your opponent. It is basically a footwork variant only, and the kick itself could be penetrating, upward or any other 
type presented later.
Th e front leg kick with no forward movement, as a stop-kick or stationary kick, will not be presented here as it is 
beyond the scope of this book.
Description
We’ll present the classic version fi rst. Master this in order to clearly understand the principles of stability and power 
delivery of the kick. Bring your rear leg forward and cross your legs while pivoting on your front foot and presenting 
your side to your opponent (Figure 2.3.2). Th is is a classical cross-step. Th e rear leg comes behind the front leg, in order 
to clear an open pathway for the front leg to chamber and kick. Do not raise your body. Th e head stays at constant 
height. Do not stay cross-legged (ever!)—chamber immediately, bringing your knee as high as possible (Figure 2.3.3). 
Deliver the kick, in the form most suitable to the circumstances (“penetrating” is illustrated in Figure 2.3.4), and chamber 
back (Figure 2.3.5). 
Figures 2.3.6 through 2.3.10 show the kick used in the classic combination. Front hand backfi st to lift  the opponent’s 
guard and front leg side kick to the exposed lower abdomen. Note the traditional delivery here with retraction of the 
backfi st and cross-legged step; In modern or competitive fi ghting, it would be possible to leave the extended hand in 
front of the opponent’s face for a few more seconds (beware of being caught), to hide the hopping step.

These images show the front leg side kick in action.
When you are profi cient with the classic version, 
you can translate the same principles of stability, 
hip movement and unchanged head height into the 
very fast “hopping version.” Th e rear leg hops forward, 
very close to the ground, to replace the front leg that 
is already going up to the chambering position 
(Figure 2.3.12), while the body is turning sideways. 
Kick (Figure 2.3.13) and chamber back.

Figure 2.3.18
Distract your opponent with a backﬁ st while you chamber and launch a front leg side kick followed by a downward backﬁ st when he drops his guard 
in response to the kick. 
Key Points
Standing foot must be fl at on the fl oor on impact.
• 
Make sure you do not bob when surging forward: head stays at the same height.
• 
Never cross legs with kicking leg behind.
• 
Targets
Targets vary depending on the type of side kick being delivered.
Typical Application
Here is the most typical use of the kick in its penetrating version. Don’t forget that the old, simple and time-tested tactics 
do work. Lunge with a real and convincing backfi st to your opponent’s face, at eye level (Figure 2.3.15). It works even 
better if you can repeat and backfi st twice. Keep your hand a few seconds more in front of your opponent’s eyes while 
you close the lunging stance with your rear foot (Figure 2.3.16) and chamber. Kick to the ribs, opened by your opponent’s 
raised hand (Figure 2.3.17). Follow-up with an additional backfi st, downwards this time, while landing the kicking foot 
(Figure 2.3.18)—your kick has now caused his hands to lower! Th e combination works best if you stay on his inside.

SIDE KICKS   69
Self-defense
Th is version of the kick is one where you attack a menacing opponent just as he prepares to attack you. Th is is not a stop-
kick, which is usually delivered a little bit diff erently (with less chambering). As your opponent shows signs of initiating 
an attack toward you, do not retreat as he intuitively expects: surge forward with a front leg penetrating side kick 
(Figures 2.3.28 and 2.3.29). You’ll catch him in mid-motion, as you have caused him to miscalculate his distance—in this 
case, with his arm raised. You can follow-up by landing, behind his front leg, on his outside, while hammerfi sting the 
back of his neck (Figure 2.3.30). And then deliver a spin-back hook kick to his face from his blind side (Figure 2.3.31).
2.4 The Universal Chamber Side Kick
General
Th e universal chambering position was popularized by Bill “Superfoot” Wallace, 
one of the best kicking artists ever. Wallace proved in points and full-contact 
competition the value of good kicking, and was able to score at will with incredibly 
fast and powerful kicks. He was generally using a front leg chambering position from 
which three possible kicks could be delivered interchangeably: a side kick, a hook 
kick or a roundhouse kick. We took the liberty to name this position: the universal 
chamber (see Figures 2.4.1 and 2.4.2). In this position, the body is protected by the leg 
and the groin by the foot. Th e leg is at 45 degrees, with the knee as high as possible, 
and the body slightly bent backward. From this position, all three kicks can be 
launched, and it is your opponent’s best guess which one you’ll ultimately deliver.
Description
Bring your rear foot forward, close to your front foot (Figure 2.4.3) and lift  into universal chamber position, with your knee 
as high as possible (Figure 2.4.4). Extend the leg as straight as possible into the target, with some hips push (Figure 2.4.5), 
and snap back to chamber (Figure 2.4.6). Th e kick is usually a hybrid of penetrating and upward, and is used high.

side view of the universal chamber.

Figures 2.4.12 and 2.4.13 show the 
delivery of a kick from the universal 
chamber. Th e opponent expects a 
roundhouse kick, but the side kick 
gets through.
Specific Training
Get into universal chambering in 
• 
front of the mirror. Practice both 
sides, and repeat endlessly.
Deliver all three diff erent kicks to 
• 
the heavy bag, from the universal 
chamber, without lowering the leg.
Squat and kick, emphasizing the universal chamber (See a similar exercise depicted in Figures 2.1.28 through 2.1.29 
• 
in the fi rst section of this chapter).
Self-defense
Confront your assailant with a convincing rear leg roundhouse toward his groin (Figure 2.4.15). Th ere is no way he 
won’t lower his hands. From the roundhouse, chamber directly into universal position and side kick his face or throat, 
eventually with a hop (see Figure 2.4.17). You are thus attacking successively, both from a diff erent angle and at a 
diff erent level. You can follow up by attacking or feinting toward his face while lowering the kicking leg (Figure 2.4.18), 
and then using your rear leg to front kick his knee (Figure 2.4.19).
Figure 2.4.12 
Figure 2.4.13
These images show a kick being delivered from the universal chamber position.
Typical Application
A typical application would be to lure the opponent into believing that you will repeat the same attack from the same 
position. Attack your opponent with a high roundhouse from the universal position. If he blocks it, just repeat but this 
time side kick to his face or sternum. See Figures 2.4.7 through 2.4.11.
Key Points
Th e knee must be as high as possible and the body 
• 
slightly bent backward.
Th e standing foot must be fl at on the fl oor.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the face, throat, sternum and solar 
plexus.

Figure 2.5.6 shows the use of the kick as a stop kick, attacking the hip joint of an advancing opponent.
2.5 The Bent-body Side Kick
General
Th is is simply a side kick performed with the upper body bent sideways much more than in the classic delivery, in order 
keep the face and body away from the opponent as much as possible. At the same time, the standing leg is bent, in order to 
allow more hip push in the kick, and therefore connecting from farther away. It is an excellent way to deliver the kick when 
you are dealing with an opponent waiting to counter or time your attack with a stop punch. It can also be of use when you 
are dealing with an opponent armed with a bladed weapon that you want to keep away from you as much as possible.
Description
Th e kick can be delivered from the front leg or the back leg, and it is the same up to the chambered position. Th en, 
while delivering the kick, you bend the standing leg, lean sideways and away, and lengthen the hip as much as possible. 
Chamber back. It is oft en delivered with a small hop from the chambered position. See Figures 2.5.1 through 2.5.4.

These illustrations depict a side view of the bent-body side kick. 

72   CHAPTER T WO
Typical Application
Th is kick is eff ectively used as an attack against an opponent waiting to time you. In this scenario, you know your 
opponent is waiting for you to commit in order to reverse punch you. Start to deliver a front leg side kick. Bend back 
and bend the knee to keep out of range of the punch, while delivering the kick. See Figures 2.5.7 through 2.5.9.
Specific Training
Hit the heavy bag from farther and farther away.
• 
Practice with an exaggeratedly low, bent leg (Figure 2.5.10). Repeat with a partner swinging a stick at chin level to 
• 
ensure the body bend.
Key Points
Keep the hips into the kick for power.
• 
Lean back and bend the standing leg simultaneously.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the throat, solar plexus, ribs, 
and lower abdomen. Th e knee is also a target, especially 
as a stop kick.
Self-defense
Your assailant takes out a knife (Figure 2.5.11). Do not wait for him to get ready, but immediately side kick his knee, 
while staying as far away as possible (Figure 2.5.12). Repeat kick at low and mid-levels to keep him off -balance, injured 
and/or unwilling to keep fi ghting (Figure 2.5.13).

If faced with the last resort of ﬁ ghting with someone wielding a deadly weapon, one strategy is to use 
the bent-body side kick early and often to keep your trunk and head as far out of range as possible.

With the head positioned far out of range, 
the bent-body side kick has an obvious 
advantage.

SIDE KICKS   73
Description
Chamber as a front kick and start pivoting 
on the standing foot and turning the hips 
together with the leg extension (Figures 
2.6.2 and 2.6.3). Finish the kick at full 
extension with a strong push of the hips, 
which turns your back slightly toward the 
opponent (Figure 2.6.4). Chamber back. 
2.6 The Front Chamber Side Kick
General
Th is is not a feint kick, but a faster way to get into a side kick, especially in sport competition. Th e kick is somewhat a 
hybrid between a front chamber and the way the side kick is delivered in Wado-ryu karate (Sokuto): less chambering but 
more hip push and a near back kick fi nish. Th e idea behind the kick is to perform the pivoting and turning of the hips—
usually done during the chambering—during the delivery of the kick itself. It gives a faster kick with less telegraphing. 
Th e loss in power is compensated by more push of the hips.

Figure 2.6.4
These illustrations depict a side view of the front chamber side kick. 
Figures 2.6.5 through 2.6.8 show the delivery of the kick: notice the front chamber and the progressive pivot and thrust 
of the hips.
Figure 2.6.5 
Figure 2.6.6 
Figure 2.6.7
Key Points
Th is is a continuous movement: perform it seamlessly.
Targets
Typical targets include the throat, sternum, ribs, and lower abdomen.
Typical Application
Th is is a surprising kick because of its range, as the opponent tends 
to expect a much shorter front kick. Th erefore, it is a good kick 
to perform aft er you have front kicked your opponent. Front kick 
(Figure 2.6.10), deliberately short, and retract the leg back to fi ghting 
stance (Figure 2.6.11). Repeat, with a break in rhythm, as you stay a millisecond more in front chamber position, to 
cause him to complete his block (Figure 2.6.12). As you have taught him the length of your front kick, he will probably 
not retreat enough to stay out of the range of your full-hipped side kick (Figure 2.6.14). You can follow up by keeping the 
pivot while landing the foot, to develop a high spinning hook kick (Chapter 5, Section 4). See Figure 2.6.15.

These images show the front chamber side kick in action.

Specific Training
Practice the kick on a heavy bag, 
• 
with a belt tied to the knee of 
your standing leg to force you 
to front chamber (Figures 2.6.16 
through 2.6.18).

hips for the transition into a side kick.
Self-defense
Th e principle of this application stays the same: this kick is deceptive about the range it can achieve. When confronted 
by an assailant, employ the advantage that wearing shoes gives you by kicking his shin with a low soccer front kick 
(Figure 2.6.20). Retract the leg directly into a front leg chamber (Figure 6.6.21): this is a totally natural movement. 
From the front chamber (which is also guarding your body), immediately start to develop the front chamber side kick, 
pivoting at the last moment with full hip thrust (Figure 2.6.22). If your assailant is out of range, add a small hop to close 
the distance. You can follow up with a low side kick to the front knee, directly from the chamber-back position, or aft er 
briefl y lowering the foot to the fl oor (Figure 2.6.23).

SIDE KICKS   75
2.7 The Back Side Kick
Ushiro geri (Shotokan karate), Yup duiro chagi (taekwondo)
General
Th is is, very simply, a penetrating side kick with more back to the opponent: more powerful but from a less advantageous 
position and with less visual coordination. Th is is, in fact, the back kick (Ushiro geri) of the Shotokan school, more on 
the side than the back kicks of some other Japanese styles.
It is interesting to note that in Bruce Lee’s jeet kune do, a distinction is made between a “basic” side kick without full 
hip thrust, and a more committed and penetrating side “rear” kick with more hip thrust and rotation toward the back.
Description
See Figures 2.7.1 through 2.7.4 Th e delivery is similar to the regular side kick, except near the end of the delivery, 
the hips push even more forward and the body pivots more, giving more back. Th e fi nal position is just between full 
back and side toward the opponent, as illustrated in the overhead view (Figure 2.7.5).
Figures 2.7.6 and 2.7.7 clearly show the diff erence between the regular penetrating side kick and the back side kick.

Figure 2.7.5
Compared overhead view of a back kick, back 
side kick, and side kick, respectively. 
Figure 2.7.6
The penetrating side kick.
Figure 2.7.7
The back side kick.
Key Points
Th e fi nal pivot and push of the hips coincides with impact, 
as it gives the powerful penetration that is the hallmark of 
this kick.
Targets
Typical targets include the groin, lower abdomen, ribs, 
solar plexus, and chin.
Typical Application
Th is is the perfect kick when you fi nd yourself in a position with your back partially toward the opponent. You attack 
your opponent’s guard with a crescent kick (Chapter 6, Section 1): hit hard and aim for the elbow (Figure 2.7.9). 
Th e momentum leads you to lower your foot with your back partially toward your retreating opponent (Figure 2.7.10). 

76   CHAPTER T WO
You immediately hop, closing the distance with your rear leg and delivering the back-side kick to your opponent’s lower 
abdomen (Figure 2.7.11), without having to change your upper body’s relative position (back half-turned toward your 
opponent). You can follow up by repeating the kick with the other leg! See Figure 2.7.12.
Specific Training
Th e purpose of the kick is to deliver more power, therefore: use the heavy bag.
Self-defense
Th is kick is also typical for use aft er having leg-blocked an attack with an inside knee sweep. You can follow up with a 
full-power backfi st while lowering the foot, or aft er a small cross-step if necessary. See Figures 2.7.13 through 2.7.18.

SIDE KICKS   77
2.8 The Oblique Back Side Kick
General
Th is is the previous kick practiced with some footwork. Like the oblique front kick, the oblique back side kick allows you 
to attack an opponent with a very tight guard, who stands with his side toward you. You step out, and then just kick back 
in. Also, the kick in itself, as practiced, is an evasion that takes you out of a straight line of attack, as will be described in 
the applications.
Th e oblique back side kick is not a “curved” side kick, where the trajectory is not totally straight to avoid obstacles on 
the straight path; Rather, it is a straight kick, and the avoidance of obstacles is done by footwork!
 Th e curved side kick is more of a feint kick; Figure 2.8.1 shows how a regular side kick traveling straight gets caught 
in the opponent’s guard. Th e curved side kick—with exaggerated hop in this photo—goes around the guard in a 
trajectory that makes it a hybrid between a side kick and a hook kick (see Figures 2.8.2 and 2.8.3). Figure 2.8.4 shows the 
diff erence of range and trajectory.
Figure 2.8.1
A regular side kick is apt to get caught in the 
opponent’s guard.
Figure 2.8.2 
Figure 2.8.3
A curved side kick (with hop) avoids obstacles on the way to the target by taking a curved path.
Another way to circumvent the opponent’s guard is the oblique back 
side kick described here.
Description
In fi ghting stance, you step forward and in (Figure 2.7.6), giving 
half your back toward the straight line (and your opponent). You 
immediately slide your rear leg close to your front in the hopping 
footwork of all front leg kicks (Figure 2.7.7). But this time, you do not 
kick in the direction of your footwork momentum, but back toward 
the straight line (Figure 2.7.8). You are kicking your opponent 45 
degrees on his unguarded inside.

curved side kick (below).

78   CHAPTER T WO
Figures 2.8.10 through 2.8.12 show the execution of the kick against a same-stance jabbing opponent.
Key Points
Giving your back to your opponent is always dangerous 
and must be a transient situation—you must perform the 
footwork and the kick in one swift  and seamless movement.
Targets
All targets are fair game, from groin to face.

Figure 2.8.15 
Figure 2.8.16
Figure 2.8.9
Overhead view of the oblique back side kick (left) and a diagram of the associated footwork (right).
Typical Application
A typical application for this kick is as an attack against an opponent with a very tight guard. Attack your opponent’s front 
leg with a sweep or a soccer low front kick (Figure 2.8.13). Keep the momentum of the kick and land forward and to your 
opponent’s inside, about 45 degrees from the straight line (Figure 2.8.14). Preferably you should punch toward his face 
while landing to keep his eyes busy and prevent a counter. Step forward, obliquely, with your rear leg, which comes to 
replace the chambering front leg (Figure 2.8.15). From that point on, the direction of momentum changes by 90 degrees, 
and you side kick your opponent from the inside (Figure 2.8.16). Note that, when you start turning your back to a trained 
opponent, he will mistakenly expect a spin kick from the other leg and from the other direction. Aft er landing your kicking 
foot, you can follow up with a spin-back outside crescent kick (Chapter 6, Section 8) with the other leg (Figure 2.8.17).

 
SIDE KICKS   79
Figure 2.8.17
As you move into position to deliver an oblique back side kick, your opponent may mistakenly anticipate 
a spin kick from the opposite leg. Potentially follow up with a back spin outside crescent kick.  
Specific Training
Practice the kick to the heavy bag over a straight line drawn on the fl oor. Get as far away from the line (and back) as 
possible while kicking in one move.
Self-defense
As an evasion from a straight attack. Your assailant rushes at to you with an overhead club strike. You evade the attack 
by stepping forward and obliquely to your inside, while punching toward his face (Figure 2.8.19). It is important to step 
forward, as well as aside, to cause him to miscalculate distance! Your rear leg then follows the front leg, doing a half step 
on its oblique trajectory. You are now fully out of the centerline. Deliver the side kick with the front leg (Figure 2.8.20). 
As you are on his inside, you must follow up, for example with a hammerfi st to the groin, while landing and bending 
away from him (Figure 2.8.21).

2.9 The Spin-back Side Kick
Bandae yeop chagi / Momdollyo yeop chagi (taekwondo), Pisaõ rodado / Chapa giratoria (capoeira), Teep glab lang (muay thai)
General
Th is is a great way to deliver the side kick. Th e use of the centrifugal force of the pivot helps its power, though, of course 
much less than with a circular spin kick. Th e kick is very deceptive, as the spin back tends to prepare the opponent for a 
circular kick to come. Th e kick is excellent as a stop kick: just wait for your opponent to telegraph his starting attack, 
and “time” him.

80   CHAPTER T WO
Description
Th is is the version from a stationary position, timing your opponent or attacking a static opponent. Of course, all 
footwork variations are acceptable, stepping forward or backward before delivering. In fi ghting stance, you start by 
turning the head and then the shoulders back and around (2.9.2 and 2.9.3). You keep turning, pivoting with the hips now. 
Up to this stage, the feet have barely moved: It is like you have stretched an elastic band and are ready to let go. You then 
fi nish your 360 degrees turn while starting to chamber the knee in a regular side kick position (Figure 2.9.4). At this stage, 
unlike a spinning back circular 
kick, you have locked the hips and 
switch to a straight movement. 
You develop the kick by extending 
the leg and pushing the hips, just 
like a regular side kick (Figure 
2.9.5). Chamber back.
Figures 2.9.6 through 2.9.9 
show the execution of the kick 
from a static stance. Figures 2.9.10 through 2.9.13 show the kick delivered off ensively aft er a forward step.

Key Points
Th e key to success with this kick is the fast turning of the hips which stops and locks instantly as you reach the 
• 
chambering position with your side toward your opponent.
Th e spinning movement starts from the head, which “pulls” the shoulders, which in turn “pull” the hips. Th e hips 
• 
keep turning without releasing the legs for as long as possible to hoard power and release it in one burst. Th e legs are 
crossed and twirled around each other until the body gets close to the kicking position.
Targets
All the body is a legitimate target, from knee to face.

 
SIDE KICKS   81
Figures 2.9.21 through 2.9.25 show how to drill the kick against a partner 
• 
holding a target pad. Train for distance, power and speed.
Typical Application
Your opponent attacks you with a front leg high roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, Section 3), which you check with a front 
hand block while retreating slightly to keep your distance (Figure 2.9.15). You shuffl  e back just enough to stay in range 
and start pivoting inside into a spin-back side kick (Figure 2.9.16). Th e kick catches your open opponent in the body 
while he’s still lowering his kicking leg (Figure 2.9.17). Aft er lowering your kicking foot in front of you, you can follow 
up with a half pivot hook kick (Chapter 5, Section 7), to the face this time (Figure 2.9.18).

2.10 The Hand-on-the-floor Side Kick
Chapa no chão (capoeira)
General
We gave this kick its capoeira name, as it is very common in their practice, but it is a very interesting and easy way to 
perform the side kick in any martial art. Th e capoeristas are trying to stay close to the fl oor at all times, and it is for them 
very natural. Th ey also have a variation where both hands are on the fl oor, somewhat of a ground kick (Escorão or Coice 
de mula). For other martial artists however, this kick is a natural continuation of the principles of the body bent side kick 
(Section 5 of this chapter). In trying to keep the body away from the opponent, you bend the upper body even more, 
until you can place the opposite hand on the fl oor. Th is kick is very surprising and disorienting for a classical opponent.
Description
We will describe the kick in its attacking forward form, but footwork can be adapted to stop-kick or stepping backward 
or sideways situations. From the fi ghting stance, you cross your rear leg behind your front leg, while starting to bend 
your body to the side, away from your opponent (Figure 2.10.2). You then lift  the leg, chamber half way and kick to the 
side like a regular side kick, while bending the body and placing the opposite hand to the fl oor (Figure 2.10.3). Because 
of the bending movement the chamber must not be with the knee as high as possible. While extending the leg, you are 
Self-defense
You confront your assailant and lunge punch toward his face (Figure 2.9.27). While he blocks, you immediately start 
your pivot and make use of your momentum to keep his hands busy around his head with a spinning backfi st strike 
(Figure 2.9.28). You then lock your hips to stop your spinning movement and launch your side kick to his exposed ribs 
(Figure 2.9.29). Th is move can also be delivered to an opponent who counterattacks your lunge punch: you just change 
your spinning move from forward going to slightly backward going. You should practice both variations. As you have 
side kicked him to the body, you must follow up by sticking to him while he retreats from the momentum of the kick. 
Cross step with backfi sts until in range, then try to grab his front hand while front-leg hook kicking (Chapter 5, 
Section 3) him in the head (Figures 2.9.30 and 2.9.31).

looking at your opponent from down under. Chamber back and, either keep going with other kicks, or get back into 
fi ghting stance. A capoeirista would probably use the hand on the fl oor for other kicks or to somersault or cartwheel.
Figure 2.10.4 shows the kick used as a stop kick against an opponent just about 
to initiate an attack.
Key Points
Th e hand touches the fl oor just as the foot impacts.
• 
Th e hand gives balance and power support to the kick: use it as such.
• 
Keep your eyes on your opponent at all times, while you bend from down 
• 
under, not from the side.
Targets
Th e whole body is open to the kick, from shin to face.

Figure 2.10.3
These illustrations depict a side view of the hand-on-the-ﬂ oor side kick. 
Typical Application
You attack a counterattacking opponent with a convincing roundhouse kick at medium height (Figure 2.10.5) and 
you lower the kicking foot in front of the standing leg, purposely open to counterattack (Figure 2.10.6). Whether your 
opponent retaliates with a high punch or a kick is not important, as your upper body will get out of range. While your 
opponent develops his attack, bend away and lean on the fl oor, while side kicking (Figure 2.10.7).

Use a roundhouse kick as a pretense to get yourself into position, and then launch your hand-on-the-ﬂ oor side kick. 
Specific Training
Hit the heavy bag from diff erent ranges: make sure your hand touches the fl oor simultaneously with the impact.
Self-defense
In this example, you stop-time your aggressor. As he starts his downward side stick attack (Figure 2.10.8), you step back, 
turning and crossing your front foot in front of the back. Simultaneously lower your upper body to get out of danger 
and put your hand on the fl oor (Figure 2.10.9). Side kick your assailant’s ribs (Figure 2.10.10). Lunge punch at his face 

84   CHAPTER T WO
2.11 The Kneeling-up Side Kick
General
Th is is a very interesting way to deliver the side kick: from a very low crossed knee position, very much in use in kung fu 
styles (Lau Ma) and Indonesian pencak silat. Th e use of the position itself is what makes this kick surprising. In the eyes 
of your opponent, you suddenly come down to burst up again with the kick. Going down is a footwork matter: you can 
step back, step forward or spin according to the situation. Th e kick is powerful because of the added eff ect of pushing up 
from the standing leg, but it is a kick that demands a lot of work to achieve profi ciency. On the other hand, practicing 
the kick is an outstanding conditioning exercise.
Description
We describe here, as well as in the Typical Application, the kick from the low crossed leg position achieved by pivoting 
on the spot and turning a full 360 degrees without much movement of foot position. From the fi ghting stance, you 
turn the head and shoulders back to make a full turn (Figure 2.11.2), a little bit like a spinning kick (See Spin-back Side 
Kick—Section 9 in this chapter). While you execute the pivot you also lower yourself, with your upper body straight 
(Figures 2.11.3 and 2.11.4). How low you go depends on your fl exibility, your training and the circumstances. It can be 
a relatively high crossed leg stance (Kake dachi—karate), or practically sitting on your bent leg, like in Indonesian styles. 
You then pop up, lift ing yourself with the power of the front/upper leg, and lift  simultaneously the back/lower leg into 
chambered knee (Figure 2.11.5). Side kick and chamber back (Figure 2.11.6).

Two hand-on-the-ﬂ oor side kicks are better than one! In the heat of a ﬁ ght, you can deliver two of these kicks in succession with a high probability of 
landing both kicks.

These illustrations depict a side view of the kneeling-up side kick. 
while you are standing up, back into fi ghting stance (Figure 2.10.11). Keep your forward momentum by reiterating the 
same movement, but this time as an attack: step forward by bringing your back foot behind your front foot, which will 
be delivering a second hand-on-fl oor side kick (Figure 2.10.12). Remember one of the golden rules of fi ghting, holding 
up both for sport tournament as well as real life: if you score with a technique and repeat it immediately, you will score 
again, because very few people can learn from their mistakes in the middle of a fi ght!

 
SIDE KICKS   85
Key Points
You have to spring up from the fl oor, rebound.
• 
Th e standing up and the kicking motions are simultaneous and must reach their apex together.
• 
Keep your hands up in guard at all times.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the groin, lower abdomen, ribs, solar plexus, throat, and chin.
Typical Application
Th is example is again based on the twisting motion to go down at the same spot you are standing. Th is is, in a way, an 
evasion, followed by a kick. While your opponent starts his lunging punch toward your face, you start pivoting back 
on yourself and going down into crossed leg low position (Figures 2.11.10 and 2.11.11). Your opponent pulls back his 
punch and you pop up, while keeping your front hand as a guard before your face (Figure 2.11.12). Side-kick from the 
high chambered position (Figure 2.11.13).

Specific Training
Practice standing up to the chambered position ten to twenty reps per leg.
• 
Practice the footwork variations of the crossed legs stance (See 
• 
Kneeling-up Roundhouse Kick—Chapter 3, Section 17, 
Specifi c Training).
Only aft er achieving smooth delivery in one move, start working on power on the heavy bag.
• 
Th e kick requires hip fl exibility: work on splits and general fl exibility.
• 
Self-defense
In this case, we will illustrate a regular straight step back and crouching with no spin back and pivot. An assailant jumps 
on you with a lunging punch toward your face. Step back with your front foot behind the rear leg and “sit” down into 
position (Figures 2.11.15). As your attacker keeps coming on, and starts lift ing his knee to kick, punch his groin with 
your front hand (Figure 2.11.16). You then lift  up, while punching again to his face, and get his hands up, before side-
kicking him in the ribs (Figure 2.11.17). You can follow up by punching his face again while lowering the kicking foot 
(Figure 2.11.18), and then spin-back back kicking (Chapter 4, Section 3) his body (Figure 2.11.19).

2.12 The Drop Side Kick
General
For this kick you drop down on your hands and knees and side kick your opponent from below. Here again, such a 
kick is important only because of its unexpectedness. It is useful only on an attacking opponent who is opening himself 
during his attack: you disappear from view and let him impale himself onto your side kick. However, this is a powerful 
kick, thanks to the strong base formed by the hands and the knee.
Description
Th e kick can be executed from three footwork patterns: (a) On the spot, just going down onto the rear leg and placing 
the hands on the fl oor; (b)Stepping back with the front leg in front of the rear leg. (c) Th e third possibility is stepping 
forward with the rear leg behind the front leg, but it is much less practical, as the kick does not lend itself easily to an 
attack mode. We explain only the most common stepping-back options.
You are trying to time an attack by your opponent, and therefore, as soon as you discern the attack, turn your back 
slightly and step back with your front leg in front of your already bending rear leg (Figure 2.12.2). Alternatively, “fall” 
directly in place. In both cases, place both your hands on the fl oor, as your rear knee touches the fl oor, and keep your 
eyes on your opponent (Figure 2.12.3). Start developing the side kick, pushing with the hips and hands at impact 
(Figure 2.12.4). Chamber back and lower your kicking foot, while you are already coming up on your other leg, back to 
fi ghting stance (Figure 2.12.5).

high roundhouse in this case.
Figure 2.12.6 
Figure 2.12.7 
Figure 2.12.8
These images show the execution of the drop side kick.
Key Points
Th e success of the kick is highly dependant on timing and how fast you can get down into the chambered position.
• 
Th e hips must be used, just like in a regular side kick.
• 
Typical Application
Although this is also an excellent “timing” stop-kick against a full-momentum punch, we present the preferred 
application against a high kicker. Your opponent is a high kicker and closes the distance with a lunge punch or backfi st 
(Figure 2.12.9). You prepare your drop, while he starts his hop for a front leg high side kick (Figure 2.12.10). Drop while 
he develops his kick and hit him in the groin when he is fully open (Figure 2.12.11).
Figure 2.12.9 
Figure 2.12.10 
Figure 2.12.11
Slip under your opponent’s high kick and launch your own drop side kick to his groin. 
Specific Training
Practice the drop to chambered position fi rst, before working on the bag for power.
• 
Practice dropping down at diff erent distances, marked on the fl oor: slightly forward, slightly backward.
• 
Practice the drop with a partner swinging a stick at solar plexus level.
• 
Self-defense
Here again, we present the drop side kick against a kicking attack. Your assailant lunges with a jab to close the distance 
and launches a full rear leg roundhouse (Figure 2.12.12). You step back and drop down (Figure 2.12.13) to catch him 
with your side kick in the groin at full extension (Figure 2.12.14). Immediately drop the kicking leg down behind you 
and use your hand to lift  the body and extend the knee you have been standing on in such a way that your foot hooks his 
standing ankle (Figure 2.12.15). In this position, you drop on the fl oor while side kicking behind the knee of his hooked 
standing leg (Figure 2.12.16).

More Advanced Side Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are beyond 
the scope of this book.
The Ground Side Kick
Very much like the drop side kick, but are already on the fl oor. No doubt the best kick to be used from the ground.
The Sacrifice Drop Side Kick
Th is is the drop side kick, but performed when you do not have time to go down orderly to the fl oor, as in Section 12 of this 
chapter. So you just let yourself fall while kicking, receiving yourself on the hands. It is very eff ective to time stop an attack.
The Knee Drop Side Kick
Th is is a diffi  cult kick practiced in some Korean styles.

The Low Flying Side Kick
Th is is a very special kick, typical of Vietnamese arts. You jump high to side kick your opponent knee. 
The High Roundhouse Feint to Side Kick
Th is is a classic feint kick, natural and eff ective, where you gradually turn a roundhouse kick into a side kick.

CHAPTER THREE
Roundhouse Kicks
Straight leg roundhouse kick. (M. De Bremaeker)
Roundhouse kicks are a rather modern phenomenon. Most traditional styles of kung fu and karate 
sport very few roundhouse kicks in their classic forms. Th e emergence of the sporting side of martial 
arts has spurred their development and roundhouse kicks are certainly the most widely used kicks in 
sporting events of all types, from MMA to traditional non-contact karate, through, of course, taekwondo 
tournaments. Th ese kicks, attacking the sides of the opponent facing you, are very diff erent in feeling and 
execution than the previous straight kicks. Th ey require fl exibility, speed, and a lot of training. Once these 
kicks are mastered, they become a very powerful weapon, suitable for nearly every possible situation, 
including self-defense. 
 In the sections that follow we present all the basic variations of the kick from the fast classic version 
to the lethal straight-leg low kick of the “hard” arts, and include exotic kicks like the spinning-back and 
downward roundhouse kicks. 
3.1 The Full Roundhouse Kick
O mawashi geri (karate), Tohllyu cha tzirugi / Dol lyeu cha gi (taekwondo), Hao the / Yuan jiao / Pai lie tui (kung fu), Martelo 
em pé (capoeira), Hoanh phong cuoc / Hoanh cuoc (viet vo dao), Fouetté (savate-boxe française), Hook kick (jeet kune do)
 
General
Th e roundhouse kick is the workhorse of tournament fi ghting, and hence of fi ghting in general. Not only is it a powerful 
kick in itself as an attack, a counterattack or a “timing” stop, it is also very useful, when done without full commitment, 
as a check and gauge of your opponent’s reactions and footwork. Th e roundhouse allows you to attack the unprotected 
side of your opponent. It is not as powerful as the “straight” kicks, like the front or the side kick, because you can’t push 
with the hips into the kick. It does not have the centrifugal force of the spinning kicks either. Th e kick derives its power 

94   CHAPTER THREE
Figures 3.1.10 through 3.1.12 show a clear front view of the delivery of the full roundhouse kick.
from the pivot of the hips and its “whipping” action: getting a few inches into the target and being pulled back like a 
whip. Th e name of the kick in savate is fouetté (whipped kick). It is interesting that in no traditional kata of the Shotokan 
style, and most of the “oldest” styles, does the roundhouse kick appear, with the exception of a sequence of two drop 
roundhouse kicks (Chapter 3, Section 14) in the Unsu kata.
Th e target is to be hit with the ball of the foot, or, especially in tournament fi ghting, with the upper side of the foot 
and the front of the ankle joint (In Japanese: Haisoku, Kasokutei, Asi no ko, or Sokko).
Description
From the fi ghting position (Figures 3.1.1 and 3.1.6), lift  the rear leg, bent at the knee, on your side, parallel to the 
ground. Th is fi rst stage looks like, and basically is, a circular knee strike at hip level (Figures 3.1.2 and 3.1.7). You then 
pivot on your standing foot, turning your hips strongly, while you extend the leg in a circular motion parallel to the 
ground. When you hit the target, the kicking leg is fully extended, the hips are perpendicular to your opponent, your 
standing foot is pointing nearly opposite from your opponent, and your body is slightly bent backward (Figures 3.1.3 
and 3.1.8). As soon as you connect a few inches into the target, with the ball or the upper side of the foot (Figure 3.1.9), 
you retract the leg forcefully into bent chambered position (Figure 3.1.4). Lower the kicking leg forward (Figure 3.1.5) 
or backward. It is useful, especially at the beginning of practice, to throw the extended arm of the kicking leg backward, 
to counterbalance the hip movement. With practice, you do not need this arm move to control your balance and the 
kick delivery with the same “whipping” feeling.

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   95
Key Points
Th e pivot on the standing foot is crucial. Do not lift  the heel.
• 
Th is is the full version of the roundhouse: this is a powerful kick that needs the full swing of the hips, simultaneously 
• 
with the leg-whipping extension.
As already mentioned, the leg retraction is key to the kick’s eff ectiveness.
• 
During the fi rst knee-lift ing move, the upper body stays straight. Only during the rest of the kick do you bend 
• 
backward and sideways (up to 45 degrees).
Targets
Th e kick is in range of all targets, and eff ective all over. Being a whipping kick however, soft er targets are preferred: 
the head, the groin and the knee fi rst. Targets of secondary preference include: the solar plexus, the kidneys, the lower 
ribs, both sides of the thigh. Th e kick is also a great harassment kick to be used against the guarding hands and elbows.
Typical Application
Figures 3.1.13 and 3.1.14 illustrate a roundhouse kick application that brought this author many tournament points. 
Th e kick’s success is based on the mistaken feeling that, in a side fi ghting stance, one’s back is not vulnerable. Th ere is a 
very common misconception that a kick toward your back, when you stand in a side fi ghting stance, can be easily blocked 
and controlled with the front hand. Wrong! Th e key to the success of this move is not telegraphing it! Stand in the same 
stance as your opponent, keeping your body away in spite of the 
fact that you shift  your body weight to the front leg. Th e upper body 
is relaxed and does not move, and the head stays at constant level 
(Figure 3.1.13). With minimal upper body movement, throw a fully 
committed back leg roundhouse, directly into the lower back of 
your opponent, at belt level (Figure 3.1.14). Th is is a very diffi  cult 
move to block because of the position of your opponent’s body 
and elbow. Once the kick is on its way, bend your body 45 degrees 
backward, while you keep the standing leg bent, and extend your 
hips to gain range. Retract the leg immediately aft er contact. 
Specific Training
Lift  the knee over a chair on your side, and kick (See Figures 3.1.15 through 3.1.17).

Self-defense
An assailant seizes your right wrist with his right hand (Figure 3.1.26). Immediately step to the left , with your left  foot, 
in order to get away from any left  punch or kick he could be planning. Simultaneously lift  your (and his) right arm 
(Figure 3.1.27) in an encircling move and roundhouse kick him in his open abdomen (Figure 3.1.28). If possible, 
complete the circling move and take hold of his right wrist. You can then repeat the kick, and then launch a crescent kick 
(Chapter 6, Section 1) to the head with your other leg (Figure 3.1.29).

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   97
3.2 The Small Roundhouse Kick
Ko mawashi geri (karate), Pahn tohllyu chagi (taekwondo), Sepak bulat (pencak silat), Groin kick (jeet kune do)
General
Th e “small” version of the roundhouse kick is basically the same kick but delivered from a front kick chamber, 
with the knee in front of you, perpendicular to the ground (Figure 3.2.3). In fact, this is an extreme version, and there 
are countless variations in between the full roundhouse (chamber parallel to the ground, Figure 3.2.1) and the small 
roundhouse (front kick chamber, Figure 3.2.3). Generally, the roundhouse kick in most styles is the middle version in 
between these two extremes: the leg is chambered at 45 degrees (See Figure 3.2.2). As all variations are possible, 
we present the extremes only.
Figure 3.2.1 
Figure 3.2.2 
Figure 3.2.3
Side view of the different chambering positions for the roundhouse kick.
Figure 3.2.4
Overhead view of the different chambering positions for the roundhouse 
kick: full, regular, and small, respectively.
Th e small roundhouse is much less powerful than the full roundhouse presented earlier, but it has the advantage of 
being quicker, with less forewarning to the opponent, and off ers some protection of the body during the early stages of 
delivery. It is an excellent kick to gauge your opponent’s reactions and footwork, and a great fi rst combination attack to 
be followed by more powerful kicks.
Description
See Figures 3.2.5 through 3.2.9. Th e kick can also be delivered with the front leg, but we describe here the rear leg 
version. Lift  the knee of the rear leg into a front kick chamber (Figure 3.2.6). You then simultaneously extend the leg 
and pivot the hips into roundhouse kick position (Figure 3.2.8). When you hit the target, again with the ball or the 
upper part of the foot, the leg is parallel to the fl oor and the body is in the same position as the fi nal position of the 
full roundhouse kick. Do not forget the immediate recoil of the leg. Lower the leg in front of you or backward as the 
circumstances dictate.

Figures 3.2.10 to 3.2.13 show the front view of the diff erent stages of the development of the kick. Compare chambered 
position to the traditional full roundhouse kick, as in Figure 3.1.11, shown previously.

98   CHAPTER THREE
Key Points
Lift  the knee high—do not get tempted to deliver the kick diagonally.
• 
Turn the hips fully, just like the full roundhouse—do not make this kick an inward-tilted front kick (Chapter 1, 
• 
Section 10).
Targets
If the kick is not a feint, a distance-closer or a gauge for your opponent’s reactions, it must be target-specifi c. As it lacks 
power, it must be directed to soft  targets, and/or those susceptible to the whipping eff ect of the recoil: the groin, the solar 
plexus (precisely), the kidneys, the throat and the face.
Th e legs (thighs and knees) are good targets to prepare for a follow-up. See Figures 3.2.14 through 3.2.17 for the use of 
the kick as a “soft ener” for an outer reap takedown (O soto gari—judo) coupled with an unbalancing elbow strike.

Typical Application
Use the small roundhouse as a set-up. Attack your opponent’s lower back with a rear leg, fast small roundhouse 
(Figures 3.2.18 and 3.2.19). It is a diffi  cult kick to block, and it hurts the kidneys, even though it is not a very powerful 
kick. Even if the kick has been blocked, keep going as it was only a fast opening move (for which the full roundhouse is not 
suitable). As you retract the leg in a whipping eff ect, you backfi st your opponent’s face with the redressing of your upper 
body. In fact, this is a typical movement in which you make use of the recoil of the leg to power up your trunk coming 
back to erect, and even leaning toward your opponent, while delivering a one-legged backfi st. You then lower your kicking 
leg forward, as your opponent is stepping back. Th row a second backfi st toward your opponent’s face (Figure 3.2.20) while 
crossing your rear leg forward, behind your front leg, in a forward cross step. You then launch a hook kick (with the same 
kicking leg, Chapter 5, Section 3) to your opponent’s head, hooking around his raised hand (Figure 3.2.21). 

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   99
If possible, you should try to get a hold of your opponent’s wrist, as in Figure 3.2.22, if and when he blocks your 
second backfi st.

A fast small roundhouse will allow for closing the distance or setting up an opponent for a coming combination.
Specific Training
Speed and precision training: hit dangling tennis balls (Figure 
• 
3.2.23), and kick in increasing and decreasing order into 
the gaps of a ladder in front of you (see Figure 3.2.24).
Over a chair in front of you, but close to a wall to force the 
• 
(high) front chamber (Figures 3.2.25 and 3.2.26).

Training for speed and accuracy of the small roundhouse kick.
Figure 3.2.25 
Figure 3.2.26
The wall will force you to twist the hips at the last minute and the chair will ensure a high chamber.
Self-defense
An assailant grabs your collar from behind (Figure 3.2.27). You immediately grab your lapels, to catch his fi ngers inside 
your collar, and then bend forward and step forward. Reverse your momentum suddenly and start turning toward your 
opponent while passing your head under his arm, still caught in your collar. His fi ngers are painfully locked (Figure 
3.2.28). In order to keep his fi ngers locked, keep big shift s to a minimum and chamber your coming roundhouse as a front 
kick (Figure 3.2.29). Deliver the small roundhouse to his groin while releasing your lapels. Keep kicking! For example, use 
your other leg for a full-powered straight leg roundhouse (Chapter 3, Section 7) to the side of the knee (Figure 3.2.30).
Figure 3.2.27 
Figure 3.2.28

The small roundhouse is perfectly adequate for self-defense maneuvers like a back collar grip-release.

3.3 The Front Leg Roundhouse Kick
Kizami geri / Mae ashi mawashi geri (karate)
General
Th is is the most used version of the roundhouse kick: it is fast and allows for relative protection during the preparatory 
phases. Th e front leg roundhouse kick can be delivered in all its variations (small to full roundhouse), and with or 
without footwork. Th e front leg kick with no footwork, being nearly exclusively a “timing” kick, should be described as 
an advanced stop kick. However, it can be used as an attack when used as a low kick, as in the combination described in 
Figures 3.3.1 through 3.3.3—a roundhouse to the inside of your opponent’s leg will open his guard, make him retreat, 
and allow for a “shoot” takedown for example.
Figure 3.3.1 
Figure 3.3.2 
Figure 3.3.3
These images show a set-up for takedown.
Th e footwork for advancing with a front leg roundhouse can be one of the following: cross the rear leg in front of the 
kicking leg, or hop and the rear leg takes the place of the kicking front foot. Th ose will be described here.
Th e third possibility, more in use with a side stance, is bringing the rear foot close and parallel to the front foot, and 
then chamber. Th is option will be presented, more appropriately, with the universal chamber roundhouse kick (Section 4 
of this chapter).
Description
See delivery from starting position 
in Figure 3.3.4. Either cross your 
rear leg in front of your front foot 
while turning the hips (Figures 3.3.5 
through 3.3.7), or hop with the rear 
foot taking the place of the raising 
front foot (Figures 3.3.8 through 
3.3.10). Lift  the knee directly into 
chambered position with the hips 
already turned. Extend the leg in 
parallel to the fl oor and recoil. 
Lower the leg in front.

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   101
Figures 3.3.11 and 3.3.12 show the application of a fast front leg roundhouse kick, aiming just above the belt in 
competitive fi ghting (in order to make spotting and blocking diffi  cult, speed is of the essence here). 
Figure 3.3.11
Attack to the back from inverted stances.
Figure 3.3.12
Attack to the lower abdomen from same stances.
Key Points
In the chambered position, the body is already in place with the hips sideways and the standing foot pointing 
• 
backward.
Speed and recoil are key to the power of the kick: sink a few inches into the target and pull back!
• 
Typical Application
See Figures 3.3.13 through 3.3.19. You are in fi ghting stance with slightly more weight on the back leg. Th is is the typical 
stance for direct front kicking, as there is less weight on the front leg. Your opponent punches you and you avoid the 
punch by leaning backward, while lift ing your front leg into roundhouse chamber (Figures 3.3.14 and 3.3.15). Th is is 
a ‘timing’ kick, reaching your opponent’s head at full extension of his punch. Your stunned opponent retreats and you 
follow him by crossing your rear leg in front of your front leg, while feinting with a low jab toward his lower abdomen. 
Chamber and release your front leg roundhouse kick toward his head, again. You can follow up by again using a 
roundhouse kick from the same leg, but this time to the groin, as the previous kick caused your opponent to lift  his 
hands. For this last kick, the leg can start directly from the chambered back position without touching the ground, 
or you can have your foot “rebound” off  the fl oor (Figure 3.3.19).

102   CHAPTER THREE
Targets
All the typical targets are available, from the knee up to the face.
Specific Training
Work on the footwork alone.
• 
Th en kick the heavy bag from farther and farther away.
• 
Th en repeat, but place a chair in front of the bag to make sure you start the kicking from chamber with the leg up.
• 
Self-defense
See Figures 3.3.20 through 3.3.24. In self-defense especially, the simplest things are safer. And it is always better to take 
the initiative. Close the distance to your assailant, with a lunge punch toward his groin. Th is will make your approach 
safer, as everyone tends to protect their groin instinctively, and it will help to lure him into believing the punch was a 
feint and the real attack will be higher. You then, indeed, attack his eyes with the same (open) hand, as soon as he lowers 
his hands. Th is is not the real attack, but another feint to allow you to close the distance with your rear leg, while having 
him lift ing his hands back up. And you front leg roundhouse him in the groin or lower abdomen (Figure 3.3.23). 
As he will defi nitely lower his hands, backfi st him forcefully while lowering your kicking leg.

3.4 The Universal Chamber Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is simply a roundhouse kick, usually front leg, delivered from 
the already described universal chamber position popularized by Bill 
Wallace. From this protected position (Figure 3.4.1), the opponent 
does not know if he should expect a roundhouse, a side or a hook kick.
Description
Figures 3.4.2 through 3.4.4 illustrate the front leg version, where the 
rear foot is brought close and parallel to the front foot, before the leg is chambered.
Figure 3.4.1
This image illustrates the versatile 
universal chamber.

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   103
Figure 3.4.2 
Figure 3.4.3 
Figure 3.4.4
The universal chamber position makes it difﬁ cult for the opponent to discern which kick is coming.
Figures 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 show a high roundhouse delivered from the universal chamber.
Figure 3.4.5 
Figure 3.4.6
A side kick or a hook kick could be thrown from this same chamber.
As mentioned before, there are many nuances for each movement, emphasizing diff erent aspects and angles. 
For example, you could deliver a roundhouse kick from a chambered position more suitable to a side kick: it wouldn’t 
constitute a full universal chamber, but close, and with the same principle in mind.
Key Points
Th e body is inclined 45 degrees to the side and to the back.
• 
Th e chambered leg protects both the groin and the lower trunk.
• 
Th ere are some diff erences between the three kicks in the movement of the hips: make sure to keep them at a 
• 
minimum and to move the hips at the last moment during the kicking, so as not to reveal your intentions.
Targets
Th e universal chamber is generally not used for low kicks. Th erefore, all vital points from the groin up!
Typical Application
See Figures 3.4.7 through 3.4.12. Th e best way to use the universal chamber kicks is to alternate kicks when your 
opponent expects more of the same. Again, remember: the simplest things work best! Attack your opponent with a 
universal chamber front leg hook kick (Chapter 5, Section 5) to the face. Whether your kick scores or not (Figure 3.4.9), 
keep going and lower the leg into fi ghting stance to immediately repeat your forward movement (Figure 3.4.11) and 
universal chambering. Your opponent will instinctively expect the same kick and lift  his hands for protection, but you 
will be delivering this time, from the same chambering position, a roundhouse kick to the other, unprotected, side—
the back of his head.

104   CHAPTER THREE

Figure 3.4.12
Two different kicks launched in succession from the same chambering position.
Figure 3.4.7 
Figure 3.4.8 
Figure 3.4.9 
Figure 3.4.10
Specific Training
Th e key to success is mastering the chambered position. Th erefore you’ll have to practice in front of the mirror and 
throw the three kicks from this position. Do it with the lowering of the leg, and with no lowering in between the kicks. 
Practice slow and fast kicks.
Self-defense
Hop forward into universal chamber (3.4.14), and deliver a high roundhouse to your opponent’s head. Chamber back to 
universal chamber position (3.4.16) and deliver, this time, a low side kick to his lower belly. Th is time you change kicks, 
but also change levels. Backfi st as you lower your kicking leg (3.4.18), and then can follow up with a reverse punch. 
Kicking at diff erent heights and angles from the same chamber can be very confusing to your opponent!

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   105
3.5 The Hopping Roundhouse Kick
Surikonde mawashi geri (karate)
General
As with the previously described hopping front and side kick, the hopping roundhouse is delivered with a forward hop 
in the chambered position to allow for greater range. Th e kick can be delivered in this way in all its forms: full, small or 
universal chamber, and can be executed with the front or the rear leg. Th e arduous practice of these hopping kicks is part 
of the mastery of being able to kick from any position and any distance.
Description
Figures 3.5.1 through 3.5.4 illustrate the classic rear leg roundhouse in its “hopping” form. Chamber as usual and 
hop forward while extending the leg and pivoting with the hips. Th e hop is as close to the ground as possible, in a full 
forward movement, and when completed, fi nds you with the foot pointing backward, as per delivery of the kick in a 
regular fashion.
Figure 3.5.1 
Figure 3.5.2

The hopping roundhouse allows you to cover a long distance while kicking.
Figures 3.5.5 through 3.5.7 show the application of the “hopping” principle to a front-leg, hand-on-fl oor roundhouse kick.

These images clearly show the hop in chambered position.

Figure 3.5.8 
Figure 3.5.9 
Figure 3.5.10
Hopping while delivering the roundhouse allows you to close the gap unexpectedly.

106   CHAPTER THREE
Key Points
Th e hop is forward, not upwards, and should be done with as little upper body movement as possible.
• 
Make sure you do not bob up with your head, and so telegraph your intentions.
• 
Your kicking foot should connect just as your standing foot “lands.”
• 
Targets
All of the body is fair game as a target, just as with the corresponding roundhouse kick that you are “hopping.”
Typical Application
Th e following images illustrate a front leg hopping roundhouse with no fi rst step. You just lift  the leg and hop-kick 
(3.5.11 and 3.5.12). Th is is a very fast kick, extremely eff ective against an opponent who is not retreating (waiting in 
place to counter you or to “time” your attack). Preferably as he feints forward or initiates an attack as a response to a 
body movement of yours, you just lift  the front leg and push forward from the standing foot. You deliver the hopping 
roundhouse at belt level. As you lower your kicking leg, keep your forward and circular momentum, and spin in 
place to deliver a spinning side or hook kick to your opponent’s face or throat (Figure 3.5.14). Th is is a typical low/
high combination. You can follow up by using the circular momentum to deliver a circular ridge hand strike to your 
opponent’s face while lowering the leg (Figure 3.5.15).
Figure 3.5.15
The front-leg hopping roundhouse is a great kick to use to close the gap at the start of a combination.
Figure 3.5.11 
Figure 3.5.12

Specific Training
Strengthen your calves by long sessions of rope jumping.
• 
Kick in front of the mirror and check for telegraphing moves.
• 
Work the heavy bag from farther and farther away (mark the fl oor).
• 
Self-defense
You confront a menacing assailant, and without the hesitation he expects, deliver a hopping front leg roundhouse to the 
groin (Figure 3.5.18). Make sure you do not hop upwards and do not telegraph your move. Whether you have scored 
the hit or not, aggressively backfi st your opponent in the side of the head (as his hands must be down from the hit or the 
threat) while lowering your leg forward (Figure 3.5.19). Follow up with a straight leg low roundhouse to the knee or the 
side of the thigh (Figure 3.5.20). Low inside / High outside / Low outside!

3.6 The Oblique Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is simply a roundhouse kick delivered to a target situated not in front of you but on your outside. You simply 
accentuate your pivot and keep kicking for more than the 180 degrees necessary to reach an opponent in front of you. 
Th is kick is more powerful on one side, as you have the distance to accumulate more centrifugal energy, but on the other 
side takes longer to reach the target. But it is a surprising kick—it is out of view of your opponent during its fi rst stages, 
and it usually comes from a blind angle. It’s a perfect kick to attack an opponent whom you have overtaken on either 
side, preferably his blindside. It is a kick important to master and to strenuously practice, as it will allow you to catch an 
evading opponent and surprise him as you are able to overreach and follow him in his side-stepping.
Description
What follows is a description of a way to practice the kick as a classic rear leg roundhouse to an opponent who is 45 degrees 
on your outside. Th e kick can also be practiced as a front leg kick, and should be developed until it reaches an opponent 
totally on your outside (90 degrees). Lift  the rear leg and chamber as usual (Figure 3.6.2). Kick with an exaggerated pivot 
on the standing foot and turn the hips for another 45 degrees while extending the leg and consciously gathering centrifugal 
energy (Figure 3.6.4). Do not forget to recoil just aft er penetrating impact—this is still a whipping kick!

108   CHAPTER THREE
Figures 3.6.7 to 3.6.9 show how, by evading a lunge punch with a step forward and outside evasion, you can 
roundhouse kick with the rear leg! Th is is shorter but based on the same principle. Note, again, the punching hand 
control while kicking, this time alternating hands. Th is limits your opponent’s options, and keeps him focused 
unnecessarily on the caught hand.
Figure 3.6.7 
Figure 3.6.8 
Figure 3.6.9
A fast roundhouse kick under an incoming punch.
Key Points
Keep the fi rst stages of the kick similar to a regular kick, so as not to alert your opponent.
• 
To pivot on the standing foot is key and it is now 225 degrees, instead of 180.
• 
Keep your guard up during the kick, as it takes longer to reach target.
• 
Targets
Th is kick is more powerful than a regular roundhouse, and all targets come into account, from knee to head.
Typical Application
What follows is a description of a front leg version of the oblique kick, easier to perform than the rear leg version. 
Th erefore, practice the rear leg version oft en, so you have an easy and natural front leg version. Th e described application 
is a very good kick to be performed on an opposite guard opponent, as your oblique lunge gets you on his blind side and 
allows for a powerful roundhouse to the back of the head. See Figures 3.6.10 through 3.6.14. You stand in opposite guard 
to your opponent, and step to his outside while he lunges or jabs at you. Evade him while going forward and preferably 
with an oblique jab of yours from his blind side (Figure 3.6.11). In the same movement you hop with the back leg and 
chamber front leg, in a classical front leg roundhouse. But this time you have to pivot another 45 degrees on your standing 
foot to catch your target (Figure 3.6.13). A classic follow-up would be the lowering of the recoiling leg directly into an 
outside foot sweep: you sweep his leg forward while pulling his front shoulder backward and down (Figure 3.6.14).

Repeat with a side step bringing you to this position.
Self-defense
In opposite stance, your assailant launches a front leg side kick toward your ribs, which you evade by retreating on his 
inside, while controlling (and pulling if possible) with your front hand (Figure 3.6.20). You are now on his inside, 
out of the centerline. Immediately start launching a full rear leg oblique roundhouse to his head, while keeping your 
guard high. Th e kick should connect as his kicking leg reaches the fl oor (Figure 3.6.22). You can follow up with a 
circular ridge hand strike (Haito uchi—karate), toward which is his momentum anyway (Figure 3.6.23).

from all positions, situations, and ranges.

110   CHAPTER THREE
3.7 The Straight Leg Roundhouse Kick
Te lam toa / Te tad glang—to the body, Te sung / Te karn koa—to the head (muay thai)
General
Th is is the extremely powerful roundhouse as delivered in the hardest of martial arts styles, like Kyokushinkai karate or 
muay thai kickboxing. Th e kick is no longer a whipping kick, but a powerful “momentum” kick into which you put your 
entire body. Although usually seen delivered at lower levels, like the thigh and the ribs, the kick can be delivered to the 
head as an extremely punishing move.
Description
See Figures 3.7.1 through 3.7.4. Th e kick is generally not delivered from the front leg, as it necessitates momentum 
generated by the whole body. In this kick, it is the upper body and the hips that pull the straight rear leg directly into 
the target. Th e feeling is reminiscent of the spinning kicks where you start by pivoting the head and the shoulders to 
“pull” the leg, but this time in the other direction. Th e shoulders and arms pivot and pull the hips into a pivot, while 
the legs are under tension, like an elastic band waiting to be released. When the leg is released in full force, the arms, 
shoulders and upper body come back from their pivot to counterbalance the kick. In some schools, the leg is slightly 
bent and locks straight at impact to add a little snap, but the authors think it unnecessary. Th e impact is with the shin 
(in Japanese: ashibo) and/or the top of the foot (haisoku).

The area used to strike with in the straight-leg roundhouse.
Figures 3.7.5 through 3.7.8 show a classic and devastating use of the straight leg roundhouse. It is a low kick in this 
instance, but the principles stay the same. In these photos, a committed front kick is blocked on the outside while 
stepping back (Gedan barai—karate), and if possible the block tries to “extend” the forward move of the lowering leg. 
A rear leg, full power straight-leg roundhouse is then launched into the knee of the kicking leg as it reaches the fl oor.
Figure 3.7.5 
Figure 3.7.6

Key Points
Th is is a full commitment kick: kick with no aft erthought.
• 
Keep your guard high during the kick.
• 

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   111
Targets
As the shin is usually used, only big targets should be sought:
Th e knee, inner and outer thighs, as will be described in the low kicks.
• 
Th e ribs and kidneys. See Figures 3.7.9 and 3.7.10.
• 
Th e head (See Figures 3.7.11 through 3.7.13) and neck (Figure 3.7.14).

Figure 3.7.14
Targeting the neck.
Typical Application
Th is is an example of a “trap” move, and very similar to that shown in 
Figures 3.7.5 through 3.7.8. You purposely open your guard and “invite” your 
opponent to kick you in the ribs (Figure 3.7.15). As he does so, you block and 
control his kicking leg, preferably by hooking under it (Figure 3.7.16). 
Defl ect the kick and pull the leg to your outside, in order to bring your 
opponent off -balance and with his back turned toward you (Figure 3.7.17). 
As he is close enough, swing your shoulders and arms to launch a punishing 
straight leg roundhouse, with your shin, in your opponent’s exposed lower 
back (Figure 3.7.18). You can follow up with a high straight leg or regular 
roundhouse from the other leg (Figure 3.7.19). Low outside / high inside!

112   CHAPTER THREE
Specific Training
Th e feeling of the kick cannot be understood without heavy bag training.
• 
Also practice with a partner holding target pads at all levels.

Figures 3.7.20 through 3.7.23 show an excellent follow-up for self-defense or MMA. Aft er the kick to the outside of 
the opponent’s knee, you lower the leg behind him and crouch for a double leg lift  takedown from behind.

114   CHAPTER THREE
Anyone who has watched MMA tournaments is aware of the importance of the straight leg roundhouse. Another 
example of their versatile use is presented here. As an attack to the standing leg of a kicking opponent, whether the 
kicking leg has been “caught” (Figures 3.7.42 through 3.7.44), or whether the kick is still ongoing (Figures 3.7.45 
through 3.7.47).
Self-defense
Th is is a perfect kick for self-defense: very punishing, usable in close combat, and easy to deliver at low levels. 
Remember that the simplest things work best. Confront your assailant and immediately launch a high reverse punch to 
get him to lift  his guard (Figure 3.7.38). Use the turn of the hips and shoulders to release your rear leg into a straight-leg 
roundhouse to the exposed lower abdomen (Figure 3.7.39). Even if your opponent reacts or still has an arm to protect 
his body, the kick is extremely punishing and will, at least partly, hurt the kidneys. Th e natural follow up, as practiced in 
muay thai, would be a knee strike of the other leg while controlling his outside shoulder (Figure 3.7.40). You can then 
deliver a full-hipped circular (and downward) elbow strike to the back of his neck (Figure 3.7.41).

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   115
3.8 The Downward Roundhouse Kick
Chapéu de couro (capoeira)
General
Th is variation of the roundhouse kick is the second best preferred technique (tokui-waza) of this author, and together 
with the bent-body hook kick, has brought me the bulk of my tournament points! No wonder, as nobody really expects 
a kick to come from above. As can be expected from an exotic and sneaky kick, a variation of it is used and practiced in 
the art of capoeira. In karate circles, the kick is sometimes referred to as the “Brazilian” kick.
Th ere are many possible nuances in the execution of this kick, which go from a slightly angled roundhouse up to 
the totally vertical kick. We will describe here, as usual, the extreme version, and the experienced reader will practice, 
research and choose the variation most suitable to his fl exibility, his temperament or the situation. 
Th e downward roundhouse is simply a full roundhouse kick, in which you keep turning the hips when chambered, 
in such a way that you are nearly with your back to your opponent when the foot connects, which makes it connect from 
above. Th e more fl exible you are, the more you can turn your leg and the less back you have to “give” the opponent while 
kicking. Th e kick is extremely surprising, very diffi  cult to block, and deceptively powerful because of the innate weight 
of the leg. But it needs a lot of work to perfect! It can be executed with both the front and rear leg.
Description
We present the technique as a rear leg kick (Figures 3.8.1 through 3.8.5). Chamber your rear leg just as you would a high 
full roundhouse kick. Lift  the knee as high as possible, and keep pivoting on your standing foot and turning your hips 
while you start developing the kick. Time the development of the kick in such a way that it connects as you complete the 
turning of your hips, and your back is toward your opponent. Th e kick has come from above (See also Figure 3.8.6). 
You chamber immediately as you turn back your hips into the opposite direction for a regular chamber.
Figures 3.8.7 through 3.8.9 show an application of a less pronounced version of the kick, a favorite technique of Sensei 
Roy Faige attacking the hip joint. Although the kick is delivered low, the principles of delivery are the same: high 
chamber and twist of the hips, although less emphasized, to allow for the downward movement. Figure 3.8.7 shows 
the outside evasion and control of the punching arm. Figure 3.8.8 shows clearly the high chamber, already directed 
downward, with the foot higher than the high knee. And Figure 3.8.9 shows the impact with the shin into the hip joint.

116   CHAPTER THREE
Typical Application
Th is is our favorite set-up for the kick, performed as a front leg kick. Fast, and excellent for competition, although the 
unexpectedness of the hit oft en causes knock-downs, which make it very good for self-defense as well. Th e set-up is a 
clear hook kick preparation: a high punching feint, the turning of the body and hips, the step up behind the front leg 
(Figure 3.8.15). It works even better, if you have taught him that a hook kick will follow these steps. Th is author used 
to touch the outside of the lower front leg of my opponent, as in Figure 3.8.16, although it is not imperative. It just 
misdirects his concentration for a second. You keep lift ing the leg as a hook kick coming to his outside for as long as 
possible, according to your degree of profi ciency and fl exibility. At the last moment, you turn the hips and chamber the 
leg as high as possible with most of your back toward the opponent. You develop the kick to make it come diagonally 
downwards to the inside of your opponent’s head (Figure 3.8.17). Once the kick has connected, chamber and lower the 
leg. If necessary, you are in a perfect position for a back kick, from either leg, to his midsection (Figure 3.8.19). 
Key Points
Th e development of the kick comes as late as possible, 
• 
so as to make it come vertically downwards.
Pivot on your standing foot as much as needed to allow 
• 
the full turn of the hips.
Th e kick works only if you chamber as high as possible.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the head, the clavicle, and the back 
of the neck if your opponent is bent-over, or has his back 
to you. Of course, if your kick is not a full downward 
roundhouse and you come down diagonally, you also can 
target the sides of the head.

Figure 3.8.8 
Figure 3.8.9
Attacking the hip joint from above.
Figures 3.8.10 through 3.8.13 show the delivery of the kick as a rear leg high kick. Note that in this example, 
the chambering of the leg intentionally suggests a side kick or a hook kick coming to the inside. With the pivot of the 
hips, the kick switches to an oblique kick coming from above and to the outside.

Specific Training
Th e kick requires fl exibility: a lot of fl exibility work is required.
• 
Work the chamber only, as many reps as possible in front of the heavy bag 
• 
(See Figure 3.8.20).
Work on the standing bag to ensure downward trajectory (See Figure 3.8.6, 
• 
shown previously).
Work with a partner holding the striking pad facing upward lower level. Kick through!

Self-defense
Here, we present as an illustration the capoeira-like version of the kick, delivered with the rear leg. Your assailant 
is chain-punching you to the head, and you retreat to get out of range while lowering the body onto bent legs, for a 
“spring” eff ect (Figure 3.8.27). You spring back with the rear leg that just retreated, directly into a very high chambered 

118   CHAPTER THREE
knee position, while bending the body and turning the hips for a nearly full turn (Figure 3.8.28). Keep turning while hitting 
your assailant’s head diagonally from above (Figure 3.8.29). Th is is not a snap kick, but a full penetrating kick. Complete 
the leg trajectory until the foot lands, and you fi nd yourself with your back to the opponent. Finish him off  with the logical 
back kick with the other leg (Figure 3.8.31). An interesting follow-up would be landing very low on his outside, pivoting 
into kneeling position and throwing him off  by lift ing his knee and pulling down his shoulder (Figure 3.8.33).

3.9 The Bent-body Long Roundhouse Kick
General
Th e idea behind this variation of the roundhouse kick is to keep the body away from your opponent as much as possible. 
Th e reasons could be various: your opponent is a counter-puncher, your assailant is armed with a club or a stick, you need 
to be further away for a specifi c follow-up, you are checking your opponent’s reactions, and so on.
In order to keep your body away, you bend backward during the kick to the point of having your body parallel to the 
fl oor, and extend your hips while bending your standing leg. Although we have not presented it as a separate variation, 
you can bend the body up to the point where you put your hand on the fl oor, for support and/or for the preparation of 
the follow-up kicks; that would be typical of capoeira for example (Martelo preso), but not exclusively.
Th ere is an interesting variation of this kick taught in Shorinji kempo under the name Ryusui geri. It is a roundhouse 
kick to the body delivered while evading a punch to the outside by bending sideways. See Figures 3.9.1 through 3.9.5.

Figure 3.9.3

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   119
Figure 3.9.4 
Figure 3.9.5
Kicking while stepping and leaning away: effective and economical.
Description
See Figures 3.9.6 through 3.9.9. Th e kick can be executed with both front and back leg, but is more logical with the front 
leg, as you want to keep your body away. However, the rear leg version is presented as the more classic and didactic 
one. Once mastered, the front leg version is faster and easier to deliver. Lift  the rear leg in a regular chamber. As you are 
doing so, you’re already bending your body away from him. Bend the leg you are standing on while developing the kick 
and bending even more. Bend as much as necessary for the specifi c application. While you develop the kick, turn your 
hips in such a way that you can extend the hip joint a little more. You can also place a hand on the fl oor, if relevant to the 
situation (See Figure 3.9.9). Chamber back immediately aft er the hit, with your leg between you and your opponent.

Lean away while kicking, with or without your hand touching the ﬂ oor.
  
Figure 3.9.10
This photo shows the primary 
advantage of the kick: The body 
is far from the opponent’s reach.
Th is kick is, by defi nition, very useful from close range, as you lean away. Figures 3.9.11 and 3.9.12 show the delivery, 
up to hand-on-the-fl oor, from a very close range, aft er a small forward hop and front hand hooking jab. You’ll note that 
this specifi c delivery is also a hybrid of the downward roundhouse kick.
Figure 3.9.11 
Figure 3.9.12
Step in with a jab and lean away with a kick. This is a front leg delivery.

120   CHAPTER THREE
Typical Application
See Figures 3.9.13 to 3.9.18. Close the distance with a jab, get his guard up with a reverse punch that also helps you to 
turn your hips and prepare your rear leg kick (Figure 3.9.14). Try to reverse punch slightly to his inside, to cause him 
to overblock (Figure 3.9.15). Roundhouse kick his lower back at belt level, while bending your body and standing leg, 
and extending your hip (Figure 3.9.16). Th e kick is very diffi  cult to block, longer than expected from a roundhouse, 
and diffi  cult to jam or time, as your upper body is out of the range of his hands. Backfi st his face while lowering the 
leg and redressing the body (Figure 3.9.17). You can follow up with an outer reap throw (O soto gari—judo), using the 
momentum generated from the twisting of your hips and hitting him with the forearm (Figure 3.9.18).
Key Points
For a long kick, you need to fully turn the hips, 
• 
and therefore the standing foot.
Align your hips and body to allow the slight 
• 
overextension of the hip joint.
Targets
Th e long kicks with which you want to keep your distance 
usually target the mid body, therefore, typical targets 
include: the ribs, the groin and the kidneys. Also, the 
thighs and knees in low kicks are suitable targets.
Specific Training
Practice the kick on the heavy bag (mid-body height) from a given distance marked on the fl oor. Gradually move the 
• 
mark farther away.
Practice the kick with and without the hand on the fl oor.
• 
Self-defense
See Figures 3.9.19 through 3.9.23. Here, we give the opposite example. It will be a preventive front-leg bent-body 
roundhouse to the inside. You attack a menacing opponent who is holding a stick or knife before he is able to attack. 
Hop forward for a front leg roundhouse, but deliver the kick in the long, bent-body way, in order to stay out of the 
range of his weapon as much as possible. Kick in a committed way, with no hesitation, toward his groin (Figure 3.9.21). 
Kick again with the same leg, if possible without lowering the foot, with a bent-body side kick to his front knee 
(Figure 3.9.22). As soon as you have connected and he lowers his hands in pain, spring up and forward with your 
upper body, while you are still chambering the leg, for a backhand punch to the face, in a body move sometimes called 
“jack knifi ng” (Figure 3.9.23).

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   121
3.10 The Spin-back Roundhouse Kick
General
Again a kick in which the value lies in its surprising eff ect! It could have been classifi ed as a feint kick. Th e confusion of 
the opponent on the receiving end of the kick comes from the way that, when the kick fi nally comes, it comes from the 
opposite direction than the spin of the body. Th at is all there is to it. Th e idea is simple, but the kick is quite complex and 
requires a lot of training for a fast delivery. Once mastered, it’s hard to believe how effi  cient the kick actually is.
Description
See Figures 3.10.1 to 3.10.10. You pivot on your front leg, just as for any spin-back kick. Th e head and shoulders go fi rst, 
then the hips, fi nally releasing the leg. But, this time, the spin stops when your side is facing forward. Instead of using 
the twist to continue the circular spinning movement, use it to chamber the formerly back leg into a regular roundhouse 
chamber, preferably universal (Section 4 of this chapter). Th is stops the spin, and you develop the kick like a regular 
roundhouse. Th e opponent expects a spinning kick or punch, but gets a kick from the other side!

Kicking while keeping the body away is useful against an armed assailant.

122   CHAPTER THREE
Typical Application
See Figures 3.10.15 through 3.10.20. Use this technique as a feint spin-back back kick turning into a roundhouse. 
On a “blocking and counterattacking” opponent, start a spin-back back kick, and keep it looking like that for as long as 
possible, with a high chambered knee looking ready to straighten up. Th en change momentum into a roundhouse to the 
head. Surprise! Aft er connecting with his head, you lower the leg and can “rebound” into a back kick to the abdomen.
Specific Training
Work the heavy bag from a close stance, touching the bag with the front hand (Figures 3.10.21 through 3.10.24). 
• 
Work the heavy bag while alternating between this kick and the spinning back side kick.
• 
Figures 3.10.11 through 3.10.14 show the delivery of the kick into a striking pad held facing the side opposite to the 
direction of the spin.
Figure 3.10.11 
Figure 3.10.12 
Figure 3.10.13 
Figure 3.10.14
These images clearly suggest the unexpected trajectory of the kick.
Key Points
As it is partly a feint kick, it aids training to consider this 
• 
a spinning back kick until the last possible moment.
Th e spin must be fully committed.
• 
Targets
Th is is not a powerful kick, but a fast kick designed to 
surprise. Only soft  targets are valid: the groin and head.

or fl ee. As you switch your weight back onto your front leg, you are getting back into range, and able to deliver a 
full spin-back roundhouse kick. Your assailant will expect a kick from the side of the spin, not a roundhouse from 
the other direction. You can follow up with a palm strike to the face while landing and a groin knee strike while 
controlling his shoulder.

124   CHAPTER THREE
Figures 3.11.7 through 3.11.11 show the delivery of the kick to the opponent’s head. Note that the power of the kick 
makes it diffi  cult to block: should your opponent lift  his arms to block, the kick would crash them into the target.
3.11 The 360 Spin-back Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is kick, unlike the previous spin-back roundhouse, is a very powerful kick, building on the power of centrifugal force. 
It is basically a full roundhouse with some fancy footwork. Again, its importance is in the surprising eff ect, and it allows 
for “catching” opponents who retreat on a regular spin-back kick, but do not expect an additional step. Th e spin back 
can be done with a bent upper body to evade an attack or a danger, or to give the impression to your opponent that you 
are fl eeing away. Th is kick is oft en referred to by practitioners as the “tornado” kick, especially in its jumping or hopping 
form. Th e kick is powerful enough to squash the guard of the opponent, and basically cause him to hit himself with his 
upper limbs.
Description
See Figures 3.11.1 through 3.11.6. You basically spin back, just as for any spin-back kick. Turn the head fi rst, then the 
shoulders, then the hips, and then you release the leg. When you start your spin-back, move away from your opponent; 
when you complete it, move back toward him. Instead of kicking, the leg is released into a step, while you keep the 
momentum of your spinning. You put your weight on your now front leg (which was your rear leg at the beginning) 
and kick with the rear leg into a full roundhouse that has all the momentum of a full turn.

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   125
If your kick is off ensive, you can gain some distance by doing the step fi rst: do a full cross step (rear leg behind 
front leg) toward your opponent and do the spin back from this position and then release the now back leg into a full 
momentum roundhouse. You have, in fact, done the step fi rst and the spin back second, instead of the classic spin-back 
fi rst, then step!
Key Points
Develop the step just as you would a kick.
• 
Do not break the momentum of the spinning when you step.
• 
Keep your guard up when you move forward again.
• 
Targets
Th is is a powerful kick: all targets count from knee to head. You can even kick “through” the guard.
Typical Application
Although this kick can be used in many situations, it is our feeling that its best use is as a backward evasion fl owing 
naturally forward again. Th erefore, we’ll present such an application against a roundhouse kick (Figures 3.11.12 through 
3.11.19). Evade your opponent’s roundhouse by shift ing your weight on to the rear leg and starting to pivot. You can 
bend the upper body if needed. You come back forward with the full force of the circular movement of the hips, while 
your opponent is chambering back and lowering his leg. Th ere, you are catching him with the full power of the kick. 
If you have evaded the kick at the last moment, as it should be, you have probably caused him to overextend himself, 
even slightly, therefore catching him at least slightly off -balance.
A natural follow-up would be a rebounding back kick from the kicking leg (Figure 3.11.19).

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   127
Self-defense
Th is is again an evasion that is luring your opponent into a safe feeling of you being away. When assailed with a 
downward stick attack, retreat with a full step turning away from him, while bending your head and upper body 
(Figure 3.11.32). While your attacker is still off -balance from his momentum, surge back forward with the most 
powerful of roundhouses (Figure 3.11.35). If he is close enough, you should use a straight- or near straight-leg 
roundhouse kick. Keep your guard up all the time. Kick through his guard or stick if necessary, and follow-up with a 
reverse punch or palm while getting in control of his armed hand (Figure 3.11.36).

3.12 The Switch Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is again a simple variation of the roundhouse kick, just like the switch front and side kick we have already 
presented. Th e “switch” footwork allows you to: trick your opponent into a false estimation of range, use your strongest 
leg for a kick even if it is in front, totally adjust your distance when kicking an opponent coming forward, standing in 
place, or waiting to time your attack. Th e switch can be executed on all types of roundhouse kicks, but as it is generally a 
stop kick, it needs to be powerful. Th erefore, regular roundhouse, full roundhouse and straight leg roundhouse kicks are 
the more suitable techniques.
Description
See Figures 3.12.1 through 3.12.4. Hop and switch legs in the air, as close to the fl oor as possible. While switching, adjust 
your distance as needed: in place, slightly forward or slightly backward. As soon as the (now) rear leg touches the fl oor, 
it rebounds into chambering and developing the kick, using the momentum to negate any inertia. Chamber back.

Figure 3.12.4
The jump illustrated here is exaggerated for didactic purposes.

128   CHAPTER THREE
Typical Application
See Figures 3.12.15 through 3.12.20. Th is kind of technique as an attack is to be used on a standing or “waiting” 
opponent. You are in an opposite stance. Switch legs on the spot to confuse him, and let your back leg rebound up into 
a full roundhouse to the head. Lower the leg directly into a lower hook sweep of the outside of his front leg. If possible, 
Key Points
Th ere is no stopping during the move: make sure your 
• 
foot rebounds off  the fl oor.
Do not hop up, and keep your head height constant.
• 
Targets
All body targets are appropriate, from knee to head.

Figures 3.12.8 through 3.12.14 show the kick used in a great combination, but in its more straight-leg form, and 
attacking the front leg of the opponent. From close range, jab, cross, switch roundhouse the inside front leg of the 
opponent and use the momentum to spin-back and kick him in the abdomen.

Self-defense
See Figure 3.12.21 through 3.12.26. Th is example is more of a stop-kick. You retreat out of range of your assailant’s 
front kick with the switching-legs hop of a high switch roundhouse kick. Lower your kicking leg directly into a hooking 
sweep of his front leg, and pull his shoulder to take him down. For safety, keep your hand in front of his face during the 
lowering of the leg.
catch his front arm while lowering, in order to be able to use it to control him and accentuate his loss of balance. 
As he lands on the fl oor, lift  your same leg high for a downward heel (axe) kick.

3.13 The Heel Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is, very simply, a roundhouse kick delivered with the foot fl exed to its maximum, in such a way that it connects 
with the heel instead of the ball of the foot. Th is kick is, in many styles, a scraping kick going through the target, and 
we present such a kick in Applications for the sake of completeness. Its classical form is still a roundhouse with some 
penetrating eff ect. In fact, just before impact, the leg is still slightly bent, and straightens at impact with a small push of 
the hips as for a penetrating side kick. It could be considered to be a hybrid with a lot of roundhouse and a little bit of 
side-penetrating fi nish. It is an interesting kick, which can be used in special set-ups, but quite exotic and, being shorter 
than its regular counterpart, not very practical. It also requires a lot of training to master.

Figure 3.13.3 
Figure 3.13.4
A roundhouse kick connecting with the bottom of the heel.
Description
See Figures 3.13.1 through 3.13.4 above. You chamber as you would for a 
regular roundhouse or full roundhouse, fl ex the foot to its maximum and 
straighten on impact with a small push of the hips. Th e contact is with the 
lower side of the heel.

This photo show the impact of the kick 
executed to the chin.
Figure 3.13.6 
Figure 3.13.7 
Figure 3.13.8
These photos show the delivery and impact of the kick from another angle. The small extension of the leg at impact is clearly noticeable.
Key Points
Full leg extension at impact only, with a hip push.
Targets
Being a scraping kick, it is limited in practice to hitting the 
face or the shin.

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   131
Typical Application
I recommend using this kick on a standing opponent, or an opponent who likes to stay close, aft er pushing him away. 
Th is is just based on personal preference, and you may decide to use it in diff erent ways that better suit you. In this 
example, you deal with an opponent with a high guard and who stays close as he waits to stop you by timing you out. 
Feint up with a jab to his inside and crescent kick (Chapter 6, Section 1) his guard from the outside (Figure 3.13.10). 
Th is is a kick to the arm, not a shove, and it should be painful. As your kick connects, push your hips forward and extend 
the leg while pushing your heel downward and into his upper body (Figure 3.13.11). You are pushing him away. As soon 
as your leg is extended, chamber back and lower the foot (Figure 3.13.12). Immediately as the foot touches the fl oor, 
the rear legs jumps up into chambering for a roundhouse heel kick to your off -balance opponent’s chin (Figure 3.13.14).

Figure 3.13.14
Push and scrape the chin.
Figure 3.13.9 
Figure 3.13.10 
Figure 3.13.11 
Figure 3.13.12
Specific Training
Th e feeling of the kick can only be understood by kicking the heavy bag (see Figure 3.13.4, shown previously).
• 
Alternate with the regular roundhouse (ball of the foot).
• 
Self-defense
See Figures 3.13.15 through 3.13.18. An assailant takes hold of your right wrist with his right hand. Step aside while 
using your whole body to roll around his own wrist, before he can continue his attack. Circle his wrist from the outside 
in a classical release, and as soon as his wrist is bent and yours is over it, push his arm away with both of your hands, 
putting your body into the push, and pushing through him. While he is pushed away off -balance, heel roundhouse kick 
him in the chin with the rear leg.

132   CHAPTER THREE
Key Points
Put your hips into the kick, just as for a standing roundhouse.
• 
Drop down in one move.
• 
Snap the kick.
• 
Targets
Only soft  targets are applicable: the knee or the groin.
3.14 The Drop Roundhouse Kick
So tung toy (kung fu)
General
Th e drop roundhouse kick is, in our opinion, the most useful of the drop kicks: it is fast, relatively easy, and usually 
can accurately hit your opponent’s groin. It is also an easier kick to get back up from. Th e kick described here could be 
called the front leg drop roundhouse, to diff erentiate it from the next kick we’ll describe, which is more powerful and 
performed with the rear leg. Th e front leg drop roundhouse is a defensive kick with effi  ciency that is dependent on its 
surprising eff ect and the speed and accuracy of its delivery. Th e kick is present, in one form or another, in most styles of 
Asian martial arts.
Description
See Figures 3.14.1 through 3.14.7. You bend down backward on your rear knee, whether it was your starting stance 
or you got there by retreating in a back step. Your knee and both of your hands get to the fl oor simultaneously, while 
you keep watching your opponent and chamber your leg for a roundhouse movement. Develop your leg in a snapping 
movement. Your kicks gets a few inches into the target at full speed and recoils back as fast, in a whipping movement! 
From your chambered position you either keep moving on the fl oor, or lower the kicking foot onto the fl oor while 
standing up from your bent knee.

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   133
Typical Application
See Figures 3.14.13 through 3.14.16. Th e typical application for the kick is of course against a high kick, as shown before. 
Your opponent is in opposite guard and throws you a full high roundhouse from the rear leg. You drop backward and 
throw your roundhouse, trying to connect with his exposed groin at full kick extension. No more is needed, but you can 
keep kicking from the fl oor, ground side kick to the back of the knee, for example (Fig 3.14.16), or stand up away from 
him, ready for more.
Figure 3.14.13 
Figure 3.14.14 
Figure 3.14.15 
Figure 3.14.16
After the groin kick, you can keep kicking from the ﬂ oor.
Specific Training
Train the drop-down for speed. Alone, and the with a partner swinging a stick at waist level.
• 
Heavy bag kicking, but only accurately at a mark on the bag at groin level.
• 
Self-defense
See Figures 3.14.17 through 3.14.21. You want to keep your distance from an opponent rushing toward you with a 
weapon. Drop down suddenly to evade and apply a roundhouse kick to his groin. You can follow up with a twin ground 
back kick. Keep kicking his knees and shins from the fl oor or joint-kick him down until he loses his weapon or decides 
to leave you alone. Contrary to common belief, it is safer to be (actively) on the ground, especially if your opponent is 
armed with a stick or a knife. From his standing position, his targets are few and he needs to unsafely bend to get to you.

3.15 The Drop Twin Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is a more acrobatic drop kick, where you kick your opponent with both legs in a circular path. It is an interesting 
kick as it is very powerful: you use the momentum of the whole body to kick. Th e kick is powerful enough not to have 
to be accurate. If you hit only the general area of the groin or the kidneys, the reverberation of the shock wave will be 
enough to infl ict a lot of pain. On the other hand, you have to be totally committed to execute this kick, and we could 
have classifi ed it as a “suicide kick.” Th e kick is to be used on an advancing opponent, preferably hitting high on a strong 
forward momentum. Like all drop kicks, this is a great kick against a high-kicking opponent. Th is kick is even better 
(though we will not illustrate this here) against high jump kicks, which are sometimes overpowering. You disappear 

134   CHAPTER THREE
down and wait for gravity to bring him back to the ground where your twin roundhouse clears his legs from under him 
while infl icting severe damage to his knees and shins!
Description
See Figures 3.15.1 through 3.15.4. You crouch and put your hands on the fl oor. Immediately throw both bent legs 
around, using your hands both as a support and a pivot. Put your whole body into the kick and use the centrifugal force 
to gather power. Extend the legs in a double kick while “fl ying” toward your target in such a way that you reach full 
extension as you connect. You should land on the balls of your feet, in a push up-like stance. Immediately roll or jump 
away from your opponent.
Figure 3.15.1 
Figure 3.15.2 
Figure 3.15.3 
Figure 3.15.4
Drop down and twin kick with the whole body.
Key Points
For this kick to work, you need to be fully committed.
• 
Get away from opponent as soon as you have kicked.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the knees, groin, kidneys, and lower abdomen.
Typical Application
See Figures 3.15.6 through 3.15.8, which illustrate this kick against a rear leg high roundhouse, although the beauty of 
the move is that it could counter any other high kick. Catch him at full extension.
Figure 3.15.5
The photo shows the kick at impact, connecting 
simultaneously with the groin and thigh.
Figure 3.15.6 
Figure 3.15.7 
Figure 3.15.8
Evade the high kick and counter at the same time: drop and kick.
Specific Training
Th is is a powerful kick. Train on the heavy bag, and always work both sides.
Self-defense
See Figures 3.15.9 through 3.15.12. Use this against an assailant who is threatening you with a knife. Drop down and 
away as swift ly as possible and catch him in his forward momentum. Give all the power of your body momentum and 
try to catch him both on the knee and the groin for maximum damage. If needed, keep kicking from the fl oor, always 
keeping your legs between you and him.

3.16 The Rear Leg Drop Roundhouse Kick
General
Th is is the more powerful version of the drop roundhouse, as it is executed with the rear leg. Th is kick is also more 
off ensive as there is more forward momentum, but it still is a kick to be performed on an advancing opponent. 
Besides the obvious groin kicking on a high kicking opponent, those drop kicks are useful simply as surprise kicks, 
especially for experts in ground kicking, or kicks to handle overpowering forward rushing opponents, or to use against 
armed opponents, in order to keep as far away as possible from the weapon. Th e kick will be described in its more 
classical form, where you stand on your hands and knee, but it can be delivered lying on the fl oor where you have let 
yourself drop for faster delivery. An example of this is highly typical of the Unsu kata of Shotokan-ryu karate, which is 
probably the only traditional Shotokan kata where a roundhouse kick is found. Th e illustrated sequence of the kata is 
presented in Figures 3.16.1 through 3.16.5. It is a double rear leg drop roundhouse kick.

Figure 3.16.3 
Figure 3.16.4 
Figure 3.16.5
This kata excerpt shows how Shotokan-ryu karate’s Unsu kata incorporates a double rear leg drop roundhouse kick. 
Description
See Figures 3.16.6 through 3.16.9. From a relatively high stance, bend forward and pivot while going down to your hands 
and front knee. Keep your eyes on your opponent. Chamber your rear leg with the knee high and throw a roundhouse, 
in a similar way to a standing one.

136   CHAPTER THREE
Specific Training
Work the drop movement, alone and with a partner swinging a stick at waist level.
• 
Alternate on the heavy bag: a standing roundhouse, a rear leg drop roundhouse.
• 
Practice the whole 
• 
Unsu kata, or the sequence described previously in Figure sequence 3.16.1 through 3.16.5.
Alternatively, you can fi rst squat straight down while pivoting slightly back and then start your pivot forward close to 
the fl oor (See Figures 3.16.10 through 3.16.14).

Figure 3.16.11 
Figure 3.16.12 
Figure 3.16.13 
Figure 3.16.14
Moving down, then forward.
Key Points
Keep your eyes on your opponent when dropping down.
• 
Th e entire process of dropping down and kicking must be delivered in one continuous movement—there is no pause 
• 
during the execution, as time is of the essence and the power comes from the uninterrupted circular move.
Targets
Appropriate targets include the knee, groin, and kidneys.
Typical Application
See Figures 3.16.15 through 3.16.20. Your opponent is a high kicker. When you see a committed high roundhouse 
coming, you crouch back, keeping your guard up, and drop swift ly forward to the fl oor on your side and hands, close to 
him. Time your roundhouse to catch his groin at full extension. As he lowers his kicking leg, open your legs inside his 
legs, hook-kicking both his ankles and causing him to fall down with open legs. Keep kicking (his groin is open), 
and create some distance before standing up.

ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   137
Self-defense
See Figures 3.16.21 through 3.16.27. In this scenario, an assailant, who is pointing a knife at your belly, suddenly attacks 
you. You have just enough time to drop to the fl oor, on your and his side, directly into kicking position. You must drop 
with commitment—you do not have the time to just let yourself fall. kick his groin with full power, while he’s still in 
mid-movement. As soon as you have connected a few inches into the target, keep using your momentum to roll on 
yourself and pass your kicking leg behind his front leg. Keep rolling forcefully on yourself and kick his abdomen in a 
crescent kick-like move, while “scissoring” his leg. Th is is not a shove, but a real kick, using the centrifugal force of your 
roll as powerfully as possible. Your assailant falls backward and you immediately (back) hook kick your heel between his 
legs, again, before you take your distance to stand up.

3.17 The Kneeling Up Roundhouse Kick
Sien fung tie (kung fu)
General
Just like the kneeling-up side kick, the kneeling up roundhouse is a surprising kick because of the popping down/up. 
But the kneeling up roundhouse has the added advantage of using the twisting up motion for a more powerful 
roundhouse. In order to roundhouse kick from the low crossed leg position, you have to pivot into a full 180 circle 
which adds to the centrifugal force of the kick. In fact, in some styles of kung fu, this kick is called the “whirlwind” kick. 
Always use it to surprise your opponent, however, as it is diffi  cult to perform from a static position. Crouch down 
suddenly and pop back up powerfully and with full commitment. Even if this type of kick is not your cup of tea, and 
you do not feel it compatible with your style, do practice it a lot. It’s a great way to build stamina, kicking profi ciency, 
powerful muscles, and above all, it is one of those kicks that will get you on the road to being able to kick from any 
position or situation.
Description
Th ere are several ways to get to the crossed leg crouching stance, you can just pivot down without moving the feet (see the 
kneeling up side kick—Chapter 2, Section 11), or you can step back and sit on your knee. Some footwork will be described 
later. In this example (see Figures 3.17.1 through 3.17.5), you step forward with your rear foot and go down to a crossed 
leg stance. You then pop up and chamber the rear leg, using the upward momentum and the pivot of the hips to kick.

138   CHAPTER THREE
Typical Application
See Figures 3.17.6 through 3.17.10 for the “twist and down” application. Your opponent is a strong and overpowering 
puncher: he attacks you with a fully committed high jab. You pivot on yourself without moving your feet position and 
deliver a spin-back backfi st (Uraken uchi—karate) or “hammer” punch (Tettsui—karate) to his head from his outside. 
Th is is a very surprising and extremely powerful punch, especially when delivered as a “timing” stop punch. As soon as 
you have connected, you sit down on your crossed legs and evade any punching reaction to your move. You can punch 
his groin from there. Your opponent starts to retreat and you forcefully pop up in chambered roundhouse position to 
catch him from his inside this time.

Figure 3.17.17
From crossed leg stance, stand up while lifting your rear leg

back in crossed-leg stance, but on the other side. Repeat and 
advance this way.

Figure 3.17.2 
Figure 3.17.3 
Figure 3.17.4 
Figure 3.17.5
Down, then up, pouring the power of the move into the kick.
Key Points
Th e kick is one continuous move from the crouching 
• 
down to the chambering back—no stopping.
Th e kick has to go through the target before 
• 
chambering back.
Targets
All roundhouse targets come into account, from thigh 
to head. Th e kick has no logical use below the knee. 
You don’t have to go down, then up to kick down!
Specific Training
Vigorously practice the classical footwork around the low cross stance, with your hands on your hips. See Figures 
• 
3.17.11 through 3.17.24.

 Step forward and outside with your front foot in an evasion step. Follow the body with the back leg, out of the mid-line, directly into a crossed-leg 
stance. Crouch down. Stand up and repeat. Keep advancing. Then switch legs and work on the other side.
As mentioned, these are excellent and important overall kicking drills. Practice on both sides until your legs burn.
• 
Th is is a powerful kick: kick the heavy bag. 
• 
Th e down/up move is key. Practice with a partner swinging a stick at shoulder level.
• 
Self-defense
In this example, you just crouch down directly aft er a small retreating shuffl  e, with no footwork and just a little twist. 
You are attacked by a high kicker and step back to avoid and control a high rear leg roundhouse (Figure 3.17.26). 
Your overpowering opponent keeps turning for an obvious spin-back kick (Figure 3.17.27). As he is turning you slightly 
shuffl  e back, back leg fi rst, then front leg and go down into low crossed leg stance with your guard up (Figure 3.17.28). 
As soon as his spin-back hook kick has passed over your head, you pop up forcefully in chambered position and 
roundhouse kick him while he is still off -balance (Figure 3.17.30).

140   CHAPTER THREE
More Advanced Roundhouse Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are beyond 
the scope of this book.
The Low Roundhouse Kick
A great kick for self-defense, fast, 
easy and punishing. 
The Low Straight Leg 
Roundhouse Kick
Th ere is no doubt that this is one 
of the most powerful kicks around, 
and the hallmark of the hardest and 
most aggressive styles. Versatile, and 
relatively easy to deliver, as it does 
not require great fl exibility, it is the 
ideal kick for self-defense. It is the “low kick” par excellence, and even so-called in the kickboxing styles.
The Ground Roundhouse Kick
Th is kick is probably the most versatile of all ground kicks because it is fast and nimble. It is very close to the drop 
roundhouse.
The Kneeling Roundhouse Kick
Th e kneeling roundhouse kick is a roundhouse delivered while you are going down onto the knee of the standing leg. 
It is mentioned here for the sake of completeness, as this kick is practiced in some Korean styles and is a great drill for 
general kicking performance. 
The Front Chamber Roundhouse Kick
Th is kick is the archetype of the feint kick. Th is is, rightfully, a very popular kick. You deliver a full front kick for as long 
as possible, before turning it into a roundhouse when your opponent is committed to his defense. Th is kick is not to be 
confused with the small roundhouse, which is not a feint kick.
The Hook Chamber Roundhouse Kick
Again a feint kick, the name says it all. A hook kick for as long as possible fades into a roundhouse coming, obviously, 
from the other direction.
The Front Kick to Hopping Roundhouse Combination
Th is is a popular and quite natural combination. It is a very off ensive kick combination that allows for a long range, and 
is great to catch a “fl eeing” opponent. Th e diff erent angles of the two kicks in close succession give great odds of success.
The Flying Roundhouse Kick
Th e fl ying roundhouse kick is a fl ying kick fi rst. It is an interesting kick because it combines the forward momentum of 
the fl ying, with the circular path of attack of the roundhouse.
The Double Flying Roundhouse Kick
Th is highly acrobatic kick has both legs kicking simultaneously while “fl ying.” It may suit some martial artists, and, 
again, the importance of surprise and unpredictability should never be underestimated in fi ght.

 
ROUNDHOUSE KICKS   141
The Double Roundhouse Kick
Th e double roundhouse is a typical “double kick.” It is a very important kick for the striving kicking artist—a great drill, 
but also a very practical kick that could be considered a feint kick. It is, in a way, a bread and butter move for the kicking 
artist. You use the same leg to kick, chamber back and kick again from the chambered position. You can kick low/high, 
high/low, high/high, and low/low.
The Hook to Roundhouse Kick Combination
Th is classical and very natural combination follows the natural circular movement of the hook kick with a roundhouse 
on the same circle.

CHAPTER 4
Back Kicks
Back kicks are, again, straight kicks, but delivered to the rear. Th is has obvious applications for real life 
self-defense against attacks from behind. Back kicks are very powerful kicks and are present in all martial 
arts, oft en with appropriate names like mule or donkey kicks.
 Th ey are not limited to use against assailants from the rear, however, and this chapter presents the 
many footwork variations that will allow their use against an opponent facing you, as well as several 
surprising executions.
4.1 The Penetrating Back Kick
Ushiro geri (Wado-ryu karate), Dwit chagi (taekwondo), Hu jiao / Hao tshok tsha / Huwai tek (kung fu), Tendangan 
belakang (pencak silat), Ho vi cuoc (viet vo dao)
General
Back kicks are even more powerful than side kicks, because of the use of the strong and large back and gluteus muscles. 
Th e kicks are also generally delivered with the upper body leaning away from the danger zone. Th e only problem with 
those kicks is the absence of eyes on the back of our heads—these kicks are delivered partially blindly. Th ey still are very 
important kicks to master, not only for their power, but also because they are sometimes the only solution to certain 
situations. For example, in self-defense cases where you are attacked from the back, having to turn and look fi rst would 
take too much time. Th ese are also the perfect follow-up kicks when you fi nd yourself led by your momentum to a 
partially back-giving position. For example, if carried away by a circular kick which momentum you won’t be able to 
stop in time, you can exaggerate the pivot, lower you leg with your back toward your opponent, and back kick! 
Also don’t forget that deception and surprise are the best fi ghting tactics. By turning away, you can look like you are 
fl eeing, causing your overconfi dent opponent to attack and impale himself on your back kick.
Th e penetrating back kick can be executed with a range of nuances to how much “back” versus “side” you are giving 
toward the opponent. Refer to the text about the previously described back-side kick (Chapter 2, Section 7). Th e kick 
described in this chapter is the back kick as performed in the Wado-ryu school of karate (Ushiro geri). Th is is mentioned, 
because the Ushiro geri of the Shotokan school is basically the back-side kick mentioned. Th e kick described here is, 
appropriately, a full back back-kick. It can be delivered from a standing stance, a fi ghting stance with both front and back 
leg, and, as presented later, aft er a spin back or a spin forward. We’ll present the traditional way to practice it, with the 
rear leg from the fi ghting stance.
Description
See Figures 4.1.1 to 4.1.11. Lift  your rear leg forward, just like for a front kick, while looking back. Extend the leg straight 
back while leaning forward. Connect with the heel, while pushing your hips into the kick. Retract the leg and lower it in 
front or back, while pivoting toward the danger zone.

146   CHAPTER FOUR
Key Points
Lean forward, but not lower than horizontal. Try to look 
• 
over your shoulder, 
and not under.
Do not try to look back fi rst before kicking. In doing so, you lose time and 
• 
endanger yourself. Practicing will make your kick straight, without having to 
look. During the kick, if your position and training allows, start turning the 
head and looking.
At impact, your kicking foot is pointing anywhere between downward to a 
• 
45 degree angle, as comfort dictates.
Th e kick lands in the centerline, as shown in Figure 4.1.12.
• 
Targets
Th e kick is straight and coming somewhat from below. As it is extremely powerful, 
all targets are worthwhile. Even if you hit the arms he is protecting himself with, 
you will probably impact through and hurt him. Aim for the groin, the ribs, 
the lower abdomen, the sternum, the throat and the face.

BACK KICKS   147
Typical Application
See Figures 4.1.13 through 4.1.17. Th is is an example of using the back kick aft er lowering a kicking leg in such a way 
that your back is partially vulnerable. Jab on the inside of your opponent’s face to force him to block inwards, while you 
close the distance for a front leg hook kick (Chapter 5, Section 3) to the outside of his head. Lower the kicking leg with 
your back facing partially toward your opponent. Spin back a little bit more and back kick with the other leg to the open 
midsection of your opponent. Lower the leg close to him while he is staggering back from the impact, and immediately 
deliver a second full-penetrating back kick with the other leg.

The powerful back kick is the kick of choice when you land a kicking leg sideways.
Specific Training
It is important to master a straight trajectory for the kick. Practice kicking the heavy bag on a specifi c spot marked in 
• 
the middle!
Repeatedly hit the bag with a straight back kick, aft er fi rst delivering a front kick forward over a stool (see Figures 
• 
4.1.18 through 4.1.20).

Drilling both kicks at the same time.
Work with a partner holding a striking pad, as seen in Figures 4.1.21 through 4.1.23. It is very important to learn to 
• 
kick straight into the target, and not “slip” on it.
Figure 4.1.21 
Figure 4.1.22 
Figure 4.1.23
Make sure you kick straight and a few inches “into” the pad.

148   CHAPTER FOUR
Blindfolded kicking to the heavy bag is very effi  cient training.
• 
Self-defense
In a self-defense situation, when attacked from behind, always kick fi rst and look aft er! Th e example illustrated in 
Figures 4.1.24 through 4.1.28 is a more complex situation—your assailant grabs your arm and tries to apply a straight 
arm armlock. Turn away from him, while leaning down and deliver a penetrating back kick to his groin area. As soon as 
he releases you, probably with his hands down toward the pain, you use the full pivot back of the hips to knife-hand him 
on the throat or the side of the neck. You can then keep on kicking him, for example with another rear leg upward front 
kick to the groin (low/high/low).

4.2 The Short Back Kick
General
Th e short back kick is the way to deliver a back kick when your adversary is close to you—too close for a full power 
penetrating back kick. Th e idea behind this variation is to start developing the kick directly from the chambering 
position, by lift ing the knee and chambered leg parallel to the fl oor. Th e kick is not traveling directly in a straight line 
anymore, but, in its fi rst phases, as an arc, and then straight but from the outside and in parallel to the fl oor. Th is is an 
important kick to practice, together with a few other “short” kicks, as it will give you the ability to instinctively kick even 
very close opponents. Of course, it must be stressed that all the nuances of the kick are possible, per the situation, 
your fl exibility, and your preferences—It can go all the way from the (vertical) classical penetrating back kick to the 
short (horizontal) kick described here, going through all intermediate trajectories.
Description
See Figures 4.2.1 through 4.2.7. Just as with the full back kick, you chamber the rear leg in the front while looking back. 
Th en lift  the chambered knee to the side (as done for a full roundhouse kick) while starting to lean forward and slightly 
to the side. Simultaneously start to develop the kick, straight from this position.

Notice that the kick travels in an arc and in parallel to the ﬂ oor.
Figure 4.2.5
You can see the trajectories and ranges compared in this illustration. 
The short kick is shown above, and the regular kick is shown below.
Figure 4.2.6 
Figure 4.2.7
As you can see, a short back kick allows you to get enough momentum 
for an effective kick very close to you. Going the classical way, your kick 
would be jammed long before gathering power.
Figure 4.2.8 illustrates the use of the kick at mid-distance. Compare leg 
position to previous Figure 4.1.11. 
Figure 4.2.9 shows how the kick can be used against an opponent standing 
very, very close behind you. Th e kick is not to be confused with another kick 
suitable for this very close starting position: the small heel back hook kick 
(Chapter 5, Section 17).
Key Points
All steps described are performed nearly simultaneously, and the move is 
• 
one smooth motion. Do not: look fi rst, then chamber, then lift  knee. 
Lean forward at impact to put some hips into the kick.
• 
Targets
Although it is feasible to kick the head and throat if you are very fl exible, 
this is basically a very powerful body kick. Typical targets include the groin, 
lower abdomen, ribs, solar plexus, and armpit.
Typical Application
Th is kick must be automatic if you fi nd yourself with your back turned to a 
close assailant! A very useful example, in a spin-back version and successfully 
used in tournament fi ghting, is presented in Figures 4.2.10 through 4.2.14. 
You block a roundhouse to the body with a strong circular knee block with 
your front leg (Ashibo kake uke—karate). Th is leaves you with your back partly 
Figure 4.2.9

150   CHAPTER FOUR
turned toward your opponent, who gets close to you as he lowers his (hurt) kicking leg. Use your momentum to continue 
your pivot and deliver a spin-back short back kick to his lower abdomen. Finish with an elbow strike to the face.
Figure 4.2.10 
Figure 4.2.11 
Figure 4.2.12 
Figure 4.2.13 
Figure 4.2.14
This kick is recommended when spinning back close to the opponent.
Specific Training
Th is is a very important kick to master, and needs a lot of practice. 
• 
Stand in the fi ghting stance with your back
• 
 against the heavy bag (See Figure 
4.2.15). Kick with both front leg (Figure 4.2.16) and back leg, as powerfully 
as possible, without moving the body fi rst. Repeat endlessly!
Figures 4.2.17 and 4.2.18 show the drill of a lower version of the kick against 
• 
a striking pad held by a partner. Work at diff erent close ranges and heights. 
Strike hard.
Figure 4.2.15

Practice extremely close to the bag for better 
performance from all ranges.
Figure 4.2.17 
Figure 4.2.18
There is no alternative to practice with a moving partner holding a focus pad.
Self-defense
Th is is a perfect kick for all self-defense situations. As mentioned, if someone gets close behind you, kick fi rst, look later. 
Th e example presented in Figures 4.2.19 through 4.2.23 is a little more complex. An assailant attempts to grab your 
lapels or your neck from the front. React immediately by lift ing your hands forcefully and then striking both his ears 
with your palms. Start pivoting while elbowing him on the side of the head. Keep turning away and back kick him as 
soon as possible. Th e short back kick to the body will both disable him and push him away to a safer distance.

BACK KICKS   151
4.3 The Spin-back Back Kick
Dora yop tshagy (taekwondo)
General
Th e spin-back back kick is the stop kick par excellence, because it adds the power of the spin to the intrinsic power of 
the kick, but we present its other uses here. Th e kick is basically a rear leg kick, where you spin back half a turn, 
until your back is toward the opponent and then kick. On top of the power of the kick itself and of the spin-back, 
you also have the momentum of the hips toward the opponent. Th is added energy makes it a kick that is nearly 
impossible to block—only avoidance will save you! If you add to it the surprise eff ect of the spin back (which is not 
followed by a circular move), you have a kick that is a must to master. Th e drawbacks: 1. Again, you don’t have eyes 
in the back of your head; and 2. Th e combination of the straight kick with the circular spin move requires thorough 
training. Th is kick was the preferred technique (Tokui-waza) of one of this author’s national teammates, and having 
many times been on the receiving end, I can assure you that the hard training is worth the results.
Description
See Figure 4.3.1 through 4.3.4. From the fi ghting stance, you spin back—half a turn, no more—before you stop the 
spin to switch to a straight back kick. You connect with the heel. Th e spin back can be executed with a slight forward or 
backward emphasis, depending on whether this is a defensive or off ensive move. If this is a forward off ensive move, 
you can also add a little hopping once the spin is over and the kicking leg is chambered.

Figures 4.3.9 through 4.3.15 show the “short” version of the kick in close combat, delivered while making use of the 
momentum of a hook (punch) to start the spinning motion. Th is is a classic combination: jab, cross, hook to the head 
and spin-back short back kick to the body.

Figure 4.3.9 
Figure 4.3.10 
Figure 4.3.11 
Figure 4.3.12
Key Points
Th e key point here is to 
• 
totally stop the spinning motion, in its tracks, as soon as you have completed your half-turn. 
If you do not, the kick will not be straight but angled, and will probably miss its target.
On the other hand, the transition between the spin and the straight motion must be smooth.
• 
Once the leg is chambered, start delivering the kick while pushing your hips toward your opponent and leaning forward.
• 
Targets
Th e preferred targets are on the lower trunk, especially if it is a stop-kick. But, as it is probably the most powerful kick 
possible, everything goes, even if protected by a limb: thighs, groin, hips, ribs, belly, sternum, throat, face, and more.
Typical Application
Figures 4.3.16 through 4.3.22 present the simplest but so eff ective way to place an off ensive spin-back back kick. 
Lunge high and to the inside of your opponent head to force him to lift  his lead hand, and lift  it to his inside. Spin back 
smoothly and back kick his uncovered side at belt level. Th e spin back and forward hip thrust make this kick 
surprisingly long! Once you have connected with his ribs, pivot in a continuation of the spin move, and lower your leg 
behind his front leg. Hit him in the face or throat, while sweeping his leg (O soto gari—judo) to throw him to the fl oor. 
If necessary, you can downward heel kick him (Figure 4.3.22).

 
BACK KICKS   153
Figure 4.3.20 
Figure 4.3.21 
Figure 4.3.22
A very effective combination: Moving to the inside of the centerline to close the distance.
Please note that the move illustrated is against an opposite guard opponent, but it is 
totally valid against an opponent standing in the same guard as you: feint high to his 
outside, spin-back back kick and lower the leg to his inside, hit the back of his neck while 
sweeping his lead leg from the inside (Uchi mata—judo).
Specific Training
As mentioned, this kick requires a lot of training. Th e key point to master it is to 
• 
stop the spin back movement as soon as half-a-turn is complete, to start with a clean 
straight kick. See Figures 4.3.23 through 4.3.25.
Mark the heavy bag in its middle, and kick from an increasingly distant fi ghting 
• 
stance. If you do not stop the spin movement, you will turn too much and miss the 
bag totally, or at least miss the mark in the middle!
One of the best targets to practice this kick on is an old car tire, held by a partner or 
• 
in a frame held in place on the wall. Th e tire is narrow and forces you to be precise in 
your execution, and it “gives” like hitting a partner. Kick hard, but with precision.
Practice kicking a hanging ball, a tennis ball for example.
• 
For people who have diffi  culties kicking straight, the following practice is recommended 
• 
at the beginning: spin back and, instead of chambering the leg, leave the kicking foot on 
the fl oor and slide it back in a straight line toward your target. Start lift ing the foot to 
deliver the kick only aft er it has overtaken the standing leg. Doing so prevents over-
spinning, and you can later lift  the kicking leg slowly earlier and earlier in the kick.
Kicking the heavy bag while blindfolded is an advanced form of training.
• 
Self-defense
Figures 4.3.26 through 4.3.30 present a “short back kick” version of the spin-back 
back kick. Your assailant has caught you in a high outside wrist lock. Lean down and 
forward, and spin back immediately to relieve pain. As soon as you have your back 
toward him, back kick, if he is close, slightly from the outside (like a short back kick). 
As soon as you have connected and he releases you, lower the leg and deliver a second 
back kick with the other leg, this time with a full-penetrating back kick.

154   CHAPTER FOUR
Key Points
Th ough it is easier to manage than it is in the spin-back version, the key point here is also to avoid mixing the circular 
• 
and straight movements which compose the kick.
As you pivot in front and toward your opponent, keep your guard up and use your raised knee as protection for 
• 
the body.
Targets
Like all back kicks, it is powerful enough for all possible targets: from knee to head.
4.4 The Spin-forward Back Kick
General
Th e spin forward back kick is a classical way to practice the back kick. It is a great drill, and helps to establish the 
perception that kicking is possible with all kinds of footwork and body positions. In practice, we don’t think it is a very 
important kick to use for other purposes. Basically, it is delivered very much like a classical rear leg penetrating side kick 
(Chapter 2, Section 1), but with a continuation of the pivot for another quarter of a turn. Th erefore, in practice and in a 
given situation, you can satisfy your kicking needs with a side kick, or even a back-side kick (Chapter 2, Section 7). 
It is still a great kick, however, if the chambering of the leg is modifi ed into a feint or a block, which leaves you naturally 
with your back facing toward your opponent.
Description
See Figures 4.4.1 through 4.4.4. Lift  your rear knee to the front, as you would for a front kick, while pivoting on your 
standing leg. You’ll fi nd yourself knee-up with your side toward your opponent, just as for a penetrating side kick. 
But you keep pivoting until your back is toward your opponent, and then develop the back kick, and chamber back.

BACK KICKS   155
Typical Application
See Figures 4.4.9 through 4.4.15. Th is is the kick based on a crescent kick feint. You lunge with a high jab, followed by 
a rear crescent kick to his blocking arm, in order to get him used to the high outside crescent kick attack. Lower the leg 
and repeat a high crescent kick with the same leg, but this time, use the momentum to pivot with your back toward him, 
leg chambered. You then deliver a long back kick, to the body and from the inside. Follow up with a full-powered backfi st 
to the face while lowering the leg.

Specific Training
Even if you do not “feel” the kick, practice it as a drill!
• 
Just as with the spin-back, practice the kick from diff erent ranges, on the heavy bag, tires, and hanging balls!
•

Self-defense
Although the kick can also be delivered from a circular leg block, we have chosen to present another crescent kick 
application in Figures 4.4.20 through 4.4.26. Your assailant holds a stick or tries to hit you with one. You determinedly 
crescent kick (Chapter 6, Section 1) his armed arm, aiming for the joint if possible. Keep your forward and circular 
momentum to get into chambered position with your back toward him. Back kick while leaning forward, aiming for 
the groin or ribs. Lower the kicking leg behind his front leg and hit him in the neck with a hammer fi st strike (Tettsui 
uchi—karate). Th en you get a hold of his throat, chin, or shoulder, and upward hook back kick (Chapter 4, Section 7) 
him between the legs, before you sweep his leg out from under him (O soto gari—judo).

Th e low back kick is basically any kick you deliver behind you at knee or lower level. 
4.6 The Uppercut Back Kick
Ushiro geri keage (karate), Sepak ayam (pencak silat)
General
We could also have named this kick the “upward back kick,” but “uppercut” hints at its shorter range. Th is is simply a 
short kick going upward behind you, from the classic back kick chambering position. It is still a very powerful kick, 
because of the use of the muscles of the back and the posterior, but limited to targets accessible from down under: 
the groin or the chin, and the head of a bent-over opponent. Although it seems simple, the kick requires serious training 
to achieve smoothness and power.
Description
See Figures 4.6.1 through 4.6.3. You chamber just as for a regular back kick, but you do not straighten the leg. Hit back 
and upward while leaning forward, and hit the target (a heavy bag is illustrated in Figure 4.6.8) from downward with the 
heel or the sole of the foot, then chamber back.

 
BACK KICKS   157
Key Points
You need to lean forward with the kick in order to achieve power.
• 
Kick straight in a vertical plane. Make sure you do not open the leg outward as is done for a short back kick (Section 2 
• 
of this chapter).
Targets 
As mentioned, the preferred targets are the groin and the chin. Also, but more diffi  cult: the armpit.
• 
Th e face and the head present worthwhile targets in general, if your opponent is bent forward.
• 
Typical Application
Th is is, of course, a great kick to use against the groin of a kicking opponent. Figures 4.6.5 through 4.6.7 illustrate a 
“timing” spin-back version of the kick. When your opponent starts his front leg high roundhouse, spin back away from 
the developing kick, giving the impression of fl eeing. At the end of your spin back, start your uppercut back kick to catch 
your opponent’s groin at the apex of his own kick. Natural follow-ups include circular strikes to the head making use of 
the spinning momentum, like a backfi st strike.
Figure 4.6.5 
Figure 4.6.6 
Figure 4.6.7
Spin and bend away from the kick and kick up into the exposed groin.
Specific Training
Only heavy bag training will allow you to train for power in this kick (see Figure 4.6.8). 
Hang the bag with bottom at diff erent heights to train for kicking groin and chin.
Self-defense
Figures 4.6.9 through 4.6.13 give an example of the use of the kick to hit the chin. Confront 
your assailant in opposite guard, and lower his guard with a jab toward his groin. Th is is one 
of our favorite openers, as no man alive can keep his hands up when his groin is threatened. 
In an uninterrupted smooth movement, your low jab becomes a powerful high hook 
(Mawashi tsuki—karate) to the side of his head, given with all your might. Let yourself go 
with your twisting motion and spin back until you have your back toward your opponent. 
Uppercut back kick his chin.

4.7 The Upward Hook Back Kick
Ushiro kake geri (karate)
General
Th is kick is very similar to the previous uppercut back kick, but derives its power from a 
whipping movement at the end of the kick. Th e kick is much less powerful than the uppercut 
kick and is almost exclusively for groin attack. Its uniqueness and importance comes from the 
hooking movement at the end of the kick: the kick overtakes the groin from under and then 
comes back up and forward, hooking into the groin. Th is is a typical self-defense kick against an 
assailant close behind you, and is practiced a lot in the classical karate styles (See Figure 4.7.1).
Description
See Figures 4.7.2 through 4.7.4. From the regular back kick chambering position, kick back and 
upward, in such a way that you catch your target with the heel from behind. You then hook up 
with the heel in a circular forward movement, back toward the high chambering position.

BACK KICKS   159
4.8 The Spin-forward Hook Back Kick
General
Th is kick is essentially the same as the previous one, but executed with the front leg, aft er a small step or hop forward. 
We’ve decided to present it separately, because it is the preferred off ensive version of the kick, and slightly diff erent 
because of its dynamic nature. Th is is a very eff ective kick, especially at close range and in self-defense applications, 
Figure 4.7.9 
Figure 4.7.10 
Figure 4.7.11 
Figure 4.7.12
This is a fantastic offensive combination, and a good use of the kick when you are behind the opponent.
Specific Training
Practice on the heavy bag, but not for power.
• 
Practice the “hooking” movement forward on a hanging tennis ball 
• 
(see Figures 4.7.13 and 4.7.14).
Figure 4.7.13 
Figure 4.7.14
Drill for speed, accuracy, and the perfection of the 
“hooking” movement.
Self-defense
Although it is not the preferred target, we have chosen to illustrate 
the use of the kick with the face as the target. Step forward toward a 
punching assailant while blocking or controlling his punch from the 
inside (Soto uke—karate). See Figure 4.7.16. Keep your aggressive 
forward momentum, while turning your inside block into a downward 
knife-hand or forearm attack to the side of his neck (Figure 4.7.17). 
Th is is a “heavy” strike, turning into pushing his head down and around. Encourage him to bend forward by kneeing 
his groin with your front leg (Figure 4.7.18). As soon as he bends forward, use the same leg to back hook kick him in the 
face, while you continue pressing down on his head with your hand (Figure 4.7.20).

   Figure 4.7.20
These images illustrate a very effective and naturally-ﬂ owing combination.
Typical Application
See Figures 4.7.9 through 4.7.12 for an application the other way around. Evade an opponent in opposite guard by cross-
stepping forward and on his outside while backfi sting him in the face. Immediately pivot to hit him on the other side of 
his head with a spinning backfi st using your other hand. Position your back to him and to his back, and upward hook 
back kick him between the legs.

160   CHAPTER FOUR
as the kick is fast and diffi  cult to see coming. Again, its nature limits the possible targets to the groin, and eventually the 
head if your opponent bends down.
Description
See Figures 4.8.1 through 4.8.4. 
You step forward by crossing your rear 
foot behind your front while starting 
to pivot. Keep turning the body while 
lift ing the leg directly toward the target, 
without chambering in front. As with 
the regular upward hook back kick, 
you connect up and behind the target, 
in order to hook up and back forward.

This is a very fast kick: hop forward while pivoting.

Th e blocking hand hits the back of the neck of the attacker and pushes it forward to meet the raising heel of the front leg.
Figure 4.8.5 
Figure 4.8.6 
Figure 4.8.7 
Figure 4.8.8
Not only the groin, but also the head can be a worthy target for this fast kick.
Key Points
Th e diff erence with the previous kick is the step forward: practice just like you would for a front leg side kick 
• 
(Chapter 2, Section 3), and just keep pivoting while kicking.
Do not chamber: lift  the heel directly just behind the target. Make use of the extra momentum of the forward hop!
• 
Targets
Groin. 
• 
Head, if opponent bends down.
• 
Typical Application
Figures 4.8.9 through 4.8.12 show a typical “trap” tactic against an opponent you know likes to counterattack with a 
reverse punch and kick. You goad him into his “timing” or counterattack move, by explosively leaning forward with a 
feint punch. Your feint must be committed, realistic and as long as possible. Evade his reverse punch by leaning back 
on the rear leg, and then retreating half a step with the front leg while pivoting and showing him your back. You look 
like you are fl eeing—no reason for him not to keep his momentum and kick you. But you hop back forward again and 
upward hook back kick him in the groin while he still is developing a kick for a retreating opponent.

Draw your opponent into a committed kick and then stop-kick him.
Specific Training
Practice as you would for the regular upward hook back kick: on the heavy bag for distance and on a hanging ball for 
perfecting the “hooking” eff ect. But this time practice faster and faster from a marked distance on the fl oor, with the 
forward step/hop.
Self-defense
Th is is a great move against a punching assailant getting too close for full range kicking. Figures 4.8.13 through 4.8.16 
show how to aggressively block a punch on the inside while keeping a closed guard up. Step in with no hesitation while 
starting to spin back, 
and use your blocking 
hand to catch him 
roughly behind 
the neck. Th is will 
distract/immobilize 
him long enough for 
your upward hook 
back kick to connect.

4.9 The Downward Back Kick
Escorpião, coice de mula (capoeira)
General
Th is is a strange kick, but we like it very much, as it is sneaky and deceptive. It is basically a “hook” back kick, but 
delivered when you are upside down, with one hand on the fl oor. And it is not delivered straight, but from the outside 
inwards. Th e kick looks simple enough, but requires serious drilling before it is powerful and easily executed. You have 
to practice a lot to get the “feel” of it, and then work on power. Th is is one of those kicks for close combat—you kick an 
opponent who you are basically already touching from very close.
Description
See Figures 4.9.1 through 4.9.3. From your fi ghting 
stance, lean forward and place the hand on the fl oor, 
one to two feet in front of your lead foot. As soon as 
the hand gets on the fl oor, switch your weight onto 
the front leg and hand and lift  the rear leg in a straight 
arc above you and inwards, hitting your imaginary 
opponent from the front.
Figure 4.9.1 
Figure 4.9.2 
Figure 4.9.3
Bend forward and kick overhead. It’s a very surprising kick when well-timed.

162   CHAPTER FOUR
Typical Application
See Figures 4.9.11 through 4.9.13. Th e most typical application would be on a front kicking opponent, carried away 
forward by his momentum. Th is is a common and easy-to-perform outside downward block (Gedan barai—karate), 
preferably with a slight outward evasion. It is even better if you can get a hold of his kicking ankle and pull it forward 
to accentuate his loss of balance. As soon as you have performed the block, you lean forward and forcefully execute the 
downward back kick to his face. Th is also illustrates that the kick cannot be straight, but travels back into the line of 
attack. Note also that leaning forward puts you out of range of a follow-up punch.
Th e kick will be easier to understand when shown being delivered to a partner. See Figures 4.9.4 through 4.9.10.
Figure 4.9.4 
Figure 4.9.5 
Figure 4.9.6
These photos show the delivery of the kick when overtaking a standing opponent from his outside.

Figure 4.9.8
These photos show the delivery of the kick from a different angle.
Figure 4.9.9 
Figure 4.9.10
These photos show the delivery of the kick from yet another angle.
Key Points
Th e leaning and kicking is executed in one uninterrupted move.
• 
Make sure you do not overkick and get unbalanced by your momentum. Aim for a few inches into the target 
• 
(Your opponent’s face), not more, and stop the kick there. Just as for any other kick, if your opponent evades or 
backs away, do not pursue him with the kick itself, as this puts you totally off -balance.
Targets
When mastered, this kick is very powerful, but the realistic targets are limited by the nature of the move itself: the face, 
the clavicle, and the higher sternum.

Figure 4.9.12

Use the forward momentum of your kicking opponent to your advantage.
Specific Training
Th is kick requires a lot of training, on the heavy bag (See Figures 4.9.14 
and 4.9.15), and with a partner protecting his head. 
First work on the feel of the kick, slowly, then faster, but without 
• 
emphasizing power.
Only when mastered, work on power.
• 
Th en work on precision: mark the bag. (Work with a partner 
• 
protecting his head with both arms).
Th en work from a little farther away and make sure you kick with 
• 
power but do not go further than a few inches into the bag.
Self-defense
Th ere are not too many fancy variations of the move, but Figures 4.9.16 through 4.9.19 show an off ensive application, 
although on a just-about-to-attack opponent. One of the great moves emphasized in Wado-ryu karate, are the forward 
evading punches, where you “time-punch” a punching opponent by going forward and evading while punching. It works 
wonders, as an attacking opponent generally expects you to retreat and develops his punch accordingly. One of those moves, 
illustrated here, is a backfi st executed while you lunge forward and to your inside. Your lunge takes you just out of the line 
of attack and close to your assailant, still developing his punch. As soon as your backfi st connects, use your momentum to 
lean forward, place the hand on the fl oor and downward back kick him in the head, from a direction he does not expect.

4.10 The Back Ghost Lift Kick
General
Th is is a very deceptive kick, in the spirit of the front “lift  kick” (Chapter 1, Section 15), outstanding for use in self-
defense. Th is is exclusively a groin kick, as it totally lacks power. You simply lift  your front foot directly up into your 
opponent’s groin, while you are pivoting back and away on your rear foot. It looks like you are fl eeing, when in fact you 
are sending up an undetectable kick. It is, of course, very eff ective, as it unexpectedly hits the groin. Although the kick 
seems simple and easy to perform, it requires quite a lot of training, as the joint movements involved are not natural.

164   CHAPTER FOUR
Th e groin—only.
Typical Application
See Figures 4.10.6 through 4.10.8 for 
an off ensive variation of the move. You 
attack with a typical medium height 
front kick/high punch combination, 
and make sure you land your kicking 
foot inside his legs. As you land and he 
prepares to counterattack, you simply 
lift  your front leg while turning away.
Specific Training
Th is kick requires training, despite its simple appearance. It is best 
• 
to practice on a heavy bag hanging with its bottom at groin level 
(See Figure 4.10.9). Th e heavy bag practice is not for power, 
but just to have a target. Practice with both legs, making sure you 
kick smoothly, with no preparatory movements. Try to vary the 
distance from where you kick and check which part of the foot 
connects from the diff erent ranges.
Practice in front of a mirror.
• 
Self-defense
As mentioned, this is a great kick for self-defense. Figures 4.10.10 through 4.10.12 show a typical use on an incoming 
assailant, in this case a stick-wielding one. Spin back as if retreating, and ghost lift  kick him while he keeps coming 
toward you. As soon as you connect, lower the leg while completing your spin, and elbow him in the head.
Description
See Figures 4.10.1 through 4.10.5. From a relatively high and nimble fi ghting stance, start spinning back and away by 
pivoting on your rear foot. Simultaneously, lift  your front leg directly into your opponent’s groin, with no chambering or 
telegraphing of the move, while you lean with your upper body. Connect with the side of the foot or the plant of the foot, 
depending on how much you have pivoted at impact.
Figure 4.10.9
Drill on the heavy bag, 
but always with relaxed 
movements for speed and 
distance, never for power.

Key Points
Th is is one uninterrupted move, with no preparations.
• 
Th e front foot goes straight to the target.
• 
Th e success of this kick is wholly based on its surprise eff ect: make sure you do not telegraph your intentions!

4.11 The Drop Back Kick
Chapa de costas (capoeira), Mule kick (common name)
General
We have mentioned, for this kick, its capoeira name, as it is very much in use in this art. Th is is, of course, natural, as 
capoeira specializes in fi ghting while hovering close to the ground. Th is kick is also very typical of the ground fi ghting 
styles of kung fu and the deception-based styles like the Monkey and Drunken styles. Th is kick is very close to the drop 
side kick (Chapter 2, Section 12), but giving more back, and therefore, more powerful, but also more “blind.” You deliver 
this kick directly to the back, or aft er turning. You can deliver the kick going forward or backward. You can execute the 
kick while using either your knee (low) or your foot (high) as support.
Description
See Figures 4.11.1 through 4.11.4. Th is is the classical way to practice the kick, directly to your rear, and resting on 
your knee. Look back to see your opponent to your rear, step back with your front foot toward him while leaning and 
kneeling on your previously front 
knee. Place your hands on the fl oor, 
and rest on the knee and hands while 
lift ing the front leg into chambered 
position. Kick while pushing your hips 
into the kick.
Figures 4.11.5 through 4.11.7 show 
an application of the classic kick against 
a punching aggressor from behind.

Figure 4.11.7

166   CHAPTER FOUR
Typical Application
Figures 4.11.8 through 4.11.11 show a more capoeira-like version of the kick. Just spin back, put your hands on the fl oor, 
and kick back. Th is is a great way to handle an aggressive puncher, coming at you overpoweringly with a salvo of high 
punches. You crouch, spin back, and kick to the groin or lower belly.
Self-defense
Figures 4.11.12 through 4.11.15 show a very interesting application of this kick. It is a special use, obviously requiring 
some specifi c training, but a great illustration of how cunning is important in fi ghting. Your assailant succeeds in hitting 
you with a tilted heel low front kick to the front knee. Give in to the kick, before it becomes a stomp, turn and bend the 
knee, while going down. You fi nd yourself with an immobilized knee on the fl oor, but a surprised opponent who has not 
yet taken advantage of his scoring kick. You lean and place your hands on the fl oor, for a powerful penetrating back kick 
to his groin area.

Figure 4.11.13 
Figure 4.11.14 
Figure 4.11.15
When hit, do not resist but go in the direction of the attack. In this case, turn it around to your advantage.
Key Points
You have to thrust your hips into the kick, by pushing 
• 
onto your supporting tripod: hands and knee, or hands 
and foot.
Always chamber back, so as not to get your leg caught.
• 
Targets
Th is is a penetrating kick: typical targets include the knee, 
groin and lower abdomen.
Figure 4.11.8 
Figure 4.11.9 
Figure 4.11.10 
Figure 4.11.11
This is a great move against a rushing opponent.
Specific Training
Th e kick is not diffi  cult to perform, but training is necessary to correctly learn to gauge distance. Practice kicking the 
heavy bag, with both legs:
Kick directly back, knee on the fl oor, aft er stepping back. 
• 
Kick directly back, knee on the fl oor, aft er stepping forward.
• 
Kick directly back, on foot and hands, aft er stepping back.
• 
Kick directly back, on foot and hands, aft er stepping forward.
• 
Spin back, knee on ground, kick.
• 
Spin forward, knee on ground, kick.
• 
Spin back, hands on fl oor, kick.
• 
Spin forward, hands on fl oor, kick.
• 

 
BACK KICKS   167
4.12 The Drop Hooking Back Kick
General
Th is kick is presented separately, because, although it is very similar to the drop back kick, the trajectory is diff erent to 
allow for the hooking movement. Similar to the diff erence seen between the regular back kick (Section 1 of this chapter) 
and the upward hook back kick (Section 7 of this chapter), the way the kick is delivered is much less powerful: you do 
not push the hips into the kick. You try to quickly get behind your opponent’s groin and then hook up and forward. 
Th e preparatory movements to get into kicking position are the same as for the previous drop back kick: you can kick 
with your knee on the fl oor, or just bent while  staying on the foot. Kick directly behind you, or spin back, or spin forward.
Description
See Figures 4.12.1 through 4.12.4. You spin back (on your back leg), bend, and put your hands on the fl oor with your 
back toward your opponent. Lift  your previously front leg directly behind the target, then hook up and forward.
Figure 4.12.1 
Figure 4.12. 2 
Figure 4.12. 3 
Figure 4.12.4
This kick represents a combination of both the drop back kick and the hook back kick.
Key Points
No need to power the kick until you pull up and back forward: the fi rst part of the kick must be fast, nimble and sneaky.
• 
Put your weight forward on your hands when you hook back forward.
• 
Targets
Th e groin, exclusively, from the front or the back.
Typical Application
Figures 4.12.5 through 4.12.8 show you the technique delivered from behind your opponent: this is an extremely painful 
and unexpected move. Th e technique is also an example of a “trap” tactic in which you try to provoke your opponent into 
an attack you will turn to your advantage. Your opponent uses easily penetrating front kicks. You will stand in opposite 
guard with your side purposely open and uncovered. As he front kicks you as expected, you evade the kick by going 
forward and to his outside, while controlling the kick and, if possible, “pulling” it forward to put your opponent off -balance. 
Complete your step forward behind him, while bending forward to avoid being hit by a natural follow-up punch. You place 
your hands on the fl oor and use your front leg to back kick him between the legs and hook him in the groin from his front.

168   CHAPTER FOUR

Acrobatic, but always unexpected!
Specific Training
Th e kick is diff erent from the regular drop back kick and needs to be practiced from all possible footwork positions. 
You can use the heavy bag, but not for power, just for targeting. Much better is kicking a hanging ball to check the 
hooking movement.
Self-defense
Figures 4.12.9 through 4.12.12 describe an example of a direct kick, with no footwork, and with the knee on the fl oor. 
Th is is not a classic move, as only one hand is on the fl oor, with some additional support from the head and/or the 
shoulder. Your assailant has caught you in a bent arm arm-lock behind the back, while trying to control your shoulder 
to prevent you from pivoting. Bend forward to alleviate the pain and go down on your free hand and opposite knee. 
Try to use your shoulder and head for additional support. As it would be diffi  cult to achieve power from this position, 
you hook back kick in the groin.

4.13 The Drop Overhead Back Kick
Rabo de arraia (capoeira angola)
General
Th is quite an acrobatic kick, typical of the Angola style of capoeira, but easier to perform than it looks. It takes a lot of 
practice to pack power into the kick, but its key advantage is surprise. One could argue against the unnecessary fl ourish 
and the danger of the kicking position, but, again, do so only aft er having faced an experienced capoeirista and their 
sneaky and totally unexpected moves.
Description
See Figures 4.13.1 through 4.13.4. You step forward and suddenly bend forward to place both your hands on the fl oor 
in front of you. Put your weight on the hands and lift  the legs in a handstand. Kick into your opponent’s face with one 
foot, while counterbalancing with the other leg. You then fall back to the starting position. You can also double kick, 
switching legs before falling back. You can even kick through and fall on your opponent!

Figure 4.13.9

Figure 4.13.5 
Figure 4.13.6 
Figure 4.13.7
Key Points
Th ere is no kick without the surprise eff ect: you drop down suddenly from a high position.
• 
Do not follow your opponent if he retreats: you have to perform the kick to its set end position, and no further.
• 
Th e power of the kick does not come from your body movement, but from the muscles of the leg and posterior: 
• 
don’t try to put your body into the kick.
Targets
Th is is not a powerful kick: the head is the only valid target.
Typical Application
Figures 4.13.10 through 4.13.13 show the kick’s use against a spin-back outside crescent kick (Chapter 6, Section 8). As 
your opponent spins back to kick, step forward and sit down on your heels while keeping up your guard. As soon as you 
have evaded the kick, place your hands on the fl oor and lift  up, kicking him in the face while he’s lowering his leg.
Figure 4.13.10 
Figure 4.13.11 
Figure 4.13.12 
Figure 4.13.13
This kick will always follow an exaggerated ducking move, and therefore, is ideal against spin-back kicks

170   CHAPTER FOUR
Self-defense
See Figures 4.13.17 through 4.13.20. You are attacked 
by a high-punching assailant. Instead of retreating, step 
forward and down on one knee and stop-reverse punch 
him in the groin. Immediately place your hands on the 
fl oor and back kick him in his unprotected face, as his 
hands went down to his groin.
4.14 The Double Drop Back Kick
Nghich ma cuoc (viet vo dao), Double mule kick (common name) 
General
Th e double drop back kick is, in its preparatory stages, very much like the regular drop kick. You can spin back or spin 
forward to kick an opponent in front of you, or just directly kick back into a rear assailant. Your body weight is on your hands 
only, as you kick with both legs, but you use the power of the whole uncoiling body, which makes it a damaging kick. It is a 
kick of choice if you lose your balance for some reason. It is a very typical kick of the ground fi ghting styles of kung fu.
Specific Training
Train in front of a wall (See Figures 4.13.14 and 
• 
4.13.15), placing your foot fi rst, then kicking lightly, 
the double kicking. Use the wall to stay in the 
handstand a few more seconds to build confi dence.
Th en start working on the heavy bag for full-power 
• 
kicking.
When the kick is mastered, start kicking the bag from 
• 
the fi ghting stance at diff erent ranges.

BACK KICKS   171
Key Points
Th e kick is one uninterrupted move from the 
• 
moment you start bending. You have to use the whole 
momentum of the body, and there is some “whipping” 
action between the bending and kicking.
You must chamber back aft er impact, so as not to get 
• 
your legs caught: bend the legs back aft er hitting a few 
inches into the target.
Targets
Typical targets include the knees, groin, lower abdomen, 
• 
solar plexus, and ribs.
If your opponent is bent forward: chin, throat and face.
•

Figure 4.14.8
The power of the kick comes out clearly in these images.
Typical Application
Figures 4.14.9 through 4.14.13 show a deliberate use of the technique from a regular standing position. Your opponent 
lunges toward you with a committed high punch, for example as you have left  yourself open on purpose. Evade the 
punch by stepping forward and to his outside, while bending below the plane of the punch. You add another step 
forward just behind his back while placing your hands on the fl oor. Your opponent pivots to follow you, and as you 
crouch and have your back toward him, he will be under the impression that you are fl eeing. You double drop back kick 
him in the lower belly as he prepares further punches.
Description
See Figures 4.14.1 through 4.14.5. Here we describe the kick aft er a cross step forward, the rear leg coming behind the 
front leg. You then spin while crouching, and place your hands on the fl oor in front of you. In one move, switch your 
weight onto your hands and throw both legs backward into the target, while pushing with your hips and using your 
whole body. Aft er impact you bend back the legs and land on the balls of your feet.

172   CHAPTER FOUR
4.15 The One-legged Drop Back Kick
General
Th is is an important kick to practice for a kicker. Th is is a kick you should automatically perform if your kicking leg 
gets caught by your opponent. To be eff ective, you must perform this maneuver immediately and nearly without 
thinking if your foot gets caught during a kick. Automatic means, of course, a lot of training and drilling, but it is 
important, as standing on one leg with your other leg caught is a very dangerous and vulnerable position. You have to 
react before your opponent’s follow-up!
Description
See Figures 4.15.1 through 4.15.6. As soon as your leg gets caught, pivot outwards on your standing leg while dropping 
to the fl oor and catching yourself on your hands. Do not try to punch your way out of this—there is no way you can be 
Specific Training
Very much like for the other drop kicks, you have to work the footwork in front of the heavy bag. In this case, you also 
have to work on the kick’s power on the bag. If this is a kick you “feel” and are likely to use, work it as a stop-kick, with a 
partner letting the heavy bag swing toward you. Perform the kick in such a way that you impact the bag with full power 
as it becomes vertical in its swing.
Self-defense
Figures 4.14.14 through 4.14.17 show you the use of this kick in a situation you have not created. Th is is, in our opinion, 
where the importance of this kick lies. You have been pushed forcefully backward and have somewhat lost your balance. 
Your opponent is coming at you to make use of this situation to punch or kick you. If you try to fi ght your rearward 
momentum to recover your balance forward, you are in danger of being hit. Th erefore, just as in judo, don’t fi ght your 
momentum but go in its direction, while spinning back to recover your balance away from your opponent. In the same 
movement, basically started by your assailant and using its power, place your hands on the fl oor, and then double back 
kick him as he is confi dently closing on you.

BACK KICKS   173
eff ective in the hands of a serious adversary. As soon as your hands touch the fl oor, and even if possible a few milliseconds 
before, you launch a powerful back kick with your formerly standing leg. Put everything you have into this kick—
you have nothing to lose. Th is is 
basically a double drop back kick 
(Section 14 of this chapter) but with 
one leg only—the other leg is already 
there! Put your hips and your whole 
body into the kick. If he does not 
release your leg, keep kicking, 
aiming for another target; and keep 
kicking until he releases you.

Figure 4.15.2

This maneuver is practically the only thing you can do if your kicking leg gets caught.
Figure 4.15.4 
Figure 4.15.5 
Figure 4.15.6
These photos show the delivery of the kick following the catch of a front kicking leg.
Key Points
Th is will only work if it is an explosive movement—the movement is uninterrupted and you do not lower yourself 
• 
toward the fl oor, you fall as fast as possible and are already kicking.
Start kicking as early as possible in the move and do not stop kicking until you are released. You are vulnerable to a 
• 
kick, in the groin for example, although it is, ironically, your caught leg that somewhat protects you.
Targets
Typical targets include the knees, groin, lower abdomen, solar plexus, throat, and chin.
Typical Application
Th ere is only one application to this kick—your kicking leg gets caught. Th is is why we will not present a self-defense 
application, as it is self-evident. Th ere is one interesting variation, though, worth illustrating. Th is is a very sophisticated 
move and, frankly, unnecessary, but derived from the need in light-contact karate to “show” the referee that you have 
scored. Th is need to emphasize the points you have scored has caused tournament fi ghters to develop unhealthy habits, 
detrimental to realistic fi ghting and traditional arts. We shall not dwell on this, but one example of those nasty habits 
is staying for a few seconds with your foot on your opponent’s face aft er having scored a high kick point. Doing so is 
unwise in an actual fi ght, although it is defi nitely possible if you have really caught your opponent and stunned him. 
Th e following move is therefore unnecessarily theatrical, although it can be eff ective. See Figures 4.15.7 through 4.15.13. 
You have caught your opponent in the side of the head with a high roundhouse. Rest your foot on his shoulder and pivot 
outwards on your standing leg, just as if your kick had been caught. Th e moment your hands touch the fl oor, your foot is 
already leaving his shoulder while the other leg is already back kicking him.

More Advanced Back Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are beyond 
the scope of this book.
The Flying Back Kick
Th e name is self-explanatory. Basically, it is a fl ying side kick with more “back” toward the opponent.
The Spin-back Flying Back Kick
Th e name gives it all again: a great kick as it is easier to execute than the spin-back fl ying side kick (less spin back needed). 
Specific Training
Th ere is no substitute to training with a partner on this one! Work on both sides, 
• 
and get several kick types caught (front, side, roundhouse, and the like). 
Train for power on the heavy bag, with your “caught” leg resting on a 
• 
standing bag or a stool (See Figures 4.15.14 and 4.15.15).

CHAPTER FIVE
Hook Kicks
Hook kicks are another relatively modern development, as they are virtually absent from all ancient 
classical Chinese and Japanese styles. Th ey are prominent in recent and eclectic styles like capoeira and 
sport taekwondo. Hook kicks are based on speed and they are very eff ective when properly executed. 
Th ey are quite sneaky as they generally present themselves counter-intuitively to the recipient and follow 
diffi  cult-to-track trajectories. Th ey require fl exibility, timing, and a lot of training, but hard work in 
mastering them pays off  in the end.
 Th is chapter presents the diff erent ways to execute them in applications that will allow you to surprise 
an opponent.
5.1 The Straight Leg Hook Kick
Mawashi uchi / Ura mawashi geri (karate), Huryeo / Kumchi dolye cha gi (taekwondo), Revers (savate-boxe francaise), 
Sweep kick ( jeet kune do), Gancho (capoeira)
General
Th e hook kick is the bread-and-butter kick of the kicking artist. It is not a very powerful kick, but it is very fast, it can 
be delivered from many starting positions, and it comes at an angle that makes it diffi  cult to be seen. And one should 
remember that knockouts come more from the inability of the body to prepare itself for the concussion (i.e. seeing 
the hit coming and tensing the muscles), than from the power of the attack itself. Many knockouts, even in light-
contact karate, come from an undetected hook kick to the head. Th ose elements also make it a great “timing” stop kick, 
defi nitely a favorite. We shall describe here the classical rear leg hook kick, a diffi  cult kick to perform as such, although 
great when mastered, but the best way to train for hook kicks, especially at the beginning. It is, again, one of those 
important drills that will slowly teach your body how to kick from any position, even if you never use the kick itself. 
Th e kick described here is the straight leg version: As will be explained later (in Section 2 of this chapter), all hook kicks 
can be delivered full-range with a straight leg, straight leg with a hooking movement at the end (Kake—karate) just aft er 
impact, or with a bent leg during the development of the kick toward the straight leg at impact.
Description
From a fi ghting stance, lift  the rear knee forward and up (Figure 5.1.2), and then pivot on the standing foot to present 
your side to the opponent, just like for a full rear leg side kick (Chapter 2, Section 1). While leaning, develop the leg at 
a slight oblique angle to your inside, a little bit as if side kicking an evading opponent (Figure 5.1.4). As the leg is nearly 
straight, use your hips to start bringing the leg back to the middle line fi rst, and then apply more hip motion to enable 
you to penetrate the target a few inches. Th e trajectory of the foot is clearer from the overhead view (Figure 5.1.7), 
or from the front view (Figures 5.1.8 through 5.1.11). As soon as you have hit the target and penetrated it, bend your 
leg while pivoting back to the chambered position. Hit the target with the back of the heel (foot fl exed) or the whole of 
the plant of the foot (foot extended). In Japanese, the heel is called kakato, kibisu or ensho. Th e plant of the foot is called 
teisoku. See Figure 5.1.14).

Key Points
Th is is one smooth uninterrupted movement.
• 
Do not bob up: your head should stay at same level during the whole development of the kick.
• 
Develop the kick at belt level, not higher, in order to keep it undetected for as long as possible. Only when you start 
• 
the move back toward the centerline, do you start lift ing the leg toward the target.
Kick a few inches through the target.
• 
At impact your body and leg are in alignment and the toes of your standing foot point 180 degrees from your opponent.
• 
Targets
Th e rear leg version of the hook kick described here is a rather powerful kick and can be used against the knee, the kidneys, 
the groin, the lower ribs and the head.
Typical Application
Figures 5.1.23 to 5.1.26 show a simple but very eff ective combination for a rear leg classical hook kick: high outside / low 
outside / high inside. High lunge jab to the outside of his head, followed by a low reverse punch on his outside, aimed 
just below the elbow that just blocked the jab. (Classical Kizami / Gyacku tsuki—karate). Your opponent is “conditioned” 
to attacks to his outside, with his lead hand still controlling your low reverse punch. But your reverse punch has also 
been pulling your rear leg forward for a hook kick, which will be diffi  cult for him to see coming as it develops below his 
line of vision and comes up at the last second.

180   CHAPTER FIVE
Figure 5.1.25 
Figure 5.1.26 
Figure 5.1.27 
Figure 5.1.28
These images illustrate a  simple but very effective combination.
Specific Training
For speed, a lot of fl exibility is 
• 
needed: splits and fl exibility drills 
for the knees will yield dividends.
It is important to work on the 
• 
penetration of this kick. Th e best 
way is to have a partner holding 
target mitts shoulder width apart, 
while you practice kicking the 
second one through the fi rst! 
(See Figures 5.1.29 and 5.1.30).
Heavy bag kicking is important to develop a feeling for distance, 
• 
footwork, and impact.
For speed, agility, and fl exibility, kick over a standing bag 
• 
(or a partner’s extended arm).  For range and penetration, kick a 
ball, a basketball for example, placed on the top of the standing bag 
(or held by a partner). See Figure 5.1.31.
In fi ghting stances, hold extended rear hands with a partner and 
• 
take turns slowly delivering the rear leg hook kick to the head.
Self-defense
Th e following images illustrate an application very similar to the previous one, as it is again a follow-up to a full-hipped 
reverse punch (Gyacku tsuki—karate). It is a logical follow-up as the hip “pulls” the leg forward naturally, and it allows 
one to fi nish off  the assailant from his blind side. An assailant gets a hold of your right wrist with his right hand 
(Figure 5.1.32). You have to act fast before he makes use of this hold to further his aggression. Pull your hand back 
with your hips and your whole body, while hitting his wrist in a classical downward block (Gedan barai—karate). 
See Figure 5.1.33. As soon as you’re released, reverse your momentum and lean forward with a full hip spin into a 
powerful committed reverse punch (Figure 5.1.35). Th e hip pivot of the punch “pulls” your rear leg forward into a 
straight leg hook kick to the head on his blind outside (Figure 5.1.36).

HOOK KICKS   181
5.2 The Hooked Hook Kick
Ushiro mawashi kake geri (karate), Nakka tshagy (taekwondo)
General
All hook kicks in this chapter can be delivered either in their straight leg version, or in a “hooked” version. Th e hooked 
hook kick is simply the same kick until impact. It then hooks into the target and pulls it forward, instead of going 
through it. It is the same principle as the hooked back kick (Chapter 4, Section 7). Th e combination of the large circular 
movement and the little hooking forward gives this kick a little extra concussive power, similar to the whipping of 
the backfi st. And as the kick is always using the heel as the weapon, excluding the plant of the foot, it becomes quite 
eff ective. Th e kick itself has a shorter range than the straight leg kick, as it uses the heel of the fl exed foot and not the 
plant of the extended foot, and it also requires to be a little more into the opponent as it needs something to hook 
into. In its preferred application, the kick is even much shorter, but so eff ective: Instead of kicking the side of the head, 
hooking into it or not, you hit the back of your opponent’s head with your hooking heel. Th is is an extraordinarily 
eff ective kick at close range, as it is totally unexpected.
Description
Th e kick illustrated in Figures 5.2.1 to 5.2.6 is the classical rear leg hook kick, this time with a hooking eff ect at the end. 
But as already mentioned, all hook kicks can be performed in this way. Th e kick is performed exactly as the straight 
leg version, until impact with the heel (Figure 5.2.5) of the fl exed foot. You then start bending the leg forcefully while 
maintaining the overall circular movement into the target. Th e overhead view in Figure 5.2.7 shows how the range of 
this kick is shorter.

Figures 5.2.8 to 5.2.13 show the delivery of this kick, starting from a much closer position than for the straight leg 
hook kick and hitting the opponent behind the head.

182   CHAPTER FIVE
Key Points
Same as the straight leg version.
• 
Th e hooking move is not chambering: You do not 
• 
pivot back into chambering stance while hooking. 
Th e hooking is a short powerful kick performed while 
your body and leg are aligned.
Targets
Th e heel is a harder and more accurate weapon than the 
plant of the foot! Th e head, kidneys, neck, solar plexus, 
groin, sides of the thigh and knee are all eff ective targets.

Typical Application
Figures 5.2.14 to 5.2.17 show an off ensive “back of the head” application, to be used against a standing or a “just about 
to attack” opponent. From your fi ghting stance, lunge widely and aggressively on his outside while backfi sting the side 
of his head. Your lunge must be totally committed and take you immediately out of the centerline. Your rear leg steps up 
all the way to your front leg, to allow the same front leg to lift  for a front leg hooked hook kick to the back of the head of 
your “now-turning-toward-you” opponent.

 
HOOK KICKS   183
Specific Training
Flexibility, just like for the straight leg hook kick.
• 
Th e hooking movement must be practiced on the speed ball, the hanging ball, and the heavy bag. Make sure your kick 
• 
brings the equipment hit forward toward you. (See Figure 5.2.18).
Figure 5.2.18
Drill for speed, precision and the right “hooking” ﬁ nish.
Self-defense
As already mentioned, this is a great kick for close combat. One of the best, we would add, because of its 
unexpectedness. In a close encounter, you expect a knee strike, or a stomp, but not a high kick on the back of the head! 
See Figures 5.2.19 to 5.2.22. In a clinch, you try to uppercut your opponent’s chin while pivoting your hips into a side 
stance. Even if the uppercut is not eff ective, it is enough if it allows you to break the clinch and get into a leaning back 
side stance. With no footwork at all, lift  your front leg (See Section 3 of this chapter) into a hooked hook kick to the back 
of his head, while leaning back as much as needed. Th e more fl exible you are, the less you need to lean back, but leaning 
back is also placing your upper body away from a possible punch at close range.

5.3 The Front Leg Hook Kick
Furyo cha gi (taekwondo)
General
Th is is the fast, easier to perform version of the hook kick. But we still recommend lots of practice of this kick in its 
classical rear leg version (Section 1 of this chapter). Th e kick can be delivered straight leg or hooked, like all hook kicks. 
It can be delivered (1) directly, just lift ing the front leg, on a standing opponent, or as a “timing” stop kick to an attacking 
or approaching opponent; (2) aft er a classical cross step forward; or (3) aft er a forward hop where the rear foot replaces 
the rising front foot. Th e front leg hook kick is a very versatile and fast kick, coming from a generally surprising angle. 
But it lacks in power, when compared to the rear leg hook or spin back hook kick, and is therefore limited to groin or 
head attacks. Of course attacks to the legs and to the body are also possible, but preferably as feints, set-ups, harassment 
or distance-closing moves.

184   CHAPTER FIVE
Figures 5.3.14 through 5.3.17 show the delivery of the kick in its hopping straight-leg version, connecting with the 
plant of the foot.

Description
Figures 5.3.1 through 5.3.9 present all 3 possibilities for the front leg hook kick, only diff ering in footwork. Basically, it is 
very much like a front leg side kick (Chapter 2, Section 3), slightly oblique in reference to the centerline, and a circular 
fi nish of the extended leg.

 
HOOK KICKS   185
Key Points
In the front leg version the hip movement is even more important, and the body/leg alignment is key.
• 
Th e leg is mostly extended at belt level, and only lift ed at the end of the trajectory, in order to alert the opponent as 
• 
late as possible.
Targets
Groin
• 
Head
• 
Typical Application
Th e hook kick being this author’s favorite kick, two typical applications will be presented here: An off ensive one and a 
defensive one.
Figures 5.3.18 through 5.3.22 present a very eff ective and surprising combination, both for sport and in a self-defense 
situation. It is especially eff ective against those opponents with their guards extended away from their bodies. As your 
opponent’s front hand cries out to be caught (Beware of traps!), try to catch it in a sudden move with your front hand, 
while executing a full step. Do not step before you try to catch as you’ll telegraph your move: Try a sudden snatch and 
the stepping starts aft er your hand has launched. If you have not caught the hand, the technique stays the same, as all 
your opponent’s attention will be riveted to the hand-snatching move. Follow in a smooth move with a midsection 
roundhouse kick. If you have got hold of his hand, you pull it to keep his abdomen open. You recoil the roundhouse 
and launch a hook kick to the head from his outside, without posing the leg on the fl oor. If you still have his hand under 
control, use it to keep him in range and distracted.
Figures 5.3.23 through 5.3.25 show a defensive application very much favored by this author: a “timed” stop hook kick. 
Keep the weight of the body on your rear leg as much as possible, without appearing to do so. As soon as your opponent 
launches a committed attack, lift  your front leg into a hook kick to catch him in mid-move. Remember: the whole 
feeling of a timed stop-kick is forward—never backward. Your opponent expects you to retreat, even if only slightly, 
and develops his move in such a way. Your forward move will foil his plans and catch him before full power development.

5.4 The Spin-back Hook Kick
Ushiro mawashi geri (karate), Dora cha gi / Mom Dolye cha gi (taekwondo), Luu van cuoc (viet vo dao), Pai lie tui 
(kung fu), Te glab lang / Chorake fard hang (muay thai)
General
Th e spin-back hook kick is the powerful version of the hook kick, obviously thanks to the centrifugal acceleration 
during the spin. Of course, the kick has the drawbacks of a longer path to the target, of having to turn your back to the 
opponent, and of a diffi  cult-to-stop momentum. Th e kick is still very fast though because of the acceleration of the spin, 
Specific Training
As this is not a powerful move, the work with the heavy bag 
is not for power development, but just as a fi rm target. Hit as 
powerfully as possible though. 
Work the kick on the speedball and padded targets held by a 
• 
partner, for speed and accuracy.
Practice the kick on the heavy bag with a hop forward, but 
• 
place a chair in front of the bag to force you to chamber 
before the hop and hit high (See Figure 5.3.26).
Practice the kick as the stop-kick of Figure 5.3.25, with a 
• 
partner holding the bag up and letting it suddenly swing 
toward you (Figure 5.3.27).
A fast hook kick requires a lot of fl exibility work!
• 
Self-defense
Figures 5.3.28 through 5.3.31 show an important 
application, also interesting for tournament use, 
against an opponent who attacks your legs a lot, 
whether with sweeps or low kicks. It is a backward-
forward move to be executed smoothly and with no 
stop in between. Your opponent attempts to low-kick 
your front leg: evade by pulling the leg back with 
a full body back evasion, eventually with a slight backward hop of the rear leg. In an uninterrupted move you switch 
your momentum forward and use the evading leg to hook kick your opponent’s head, while hopping forward on your 
standing leg.

HOOK KICKS   187
and very surprising when well executed. It is devastating when used in self-defense against an untrained assailant or 
when used against an opponent unfamiliar with this type of kick. Th e kick can be delivered in its regular (straight leg) 
or in its “hooked” form. But let it be noted that the kick requires a lot of practice and training before it can be used in 
real fi ghting situations.
Description
As shown in Figures 5.4.1 through 5.4.7, the kick is basically the same hook kick but delivered with the back leg aft er a 
full 360 degrees pivot on the front foot. Th e principle of the spinning back is the same as for the other spin-back kicks we 
have seen. You start pivoting with the head fi rst, then the shoulders, which pull the waist, and only then the leg as a coiled 
elastic band. But in the case of the spin-back hook kick, the circular movement must be emphasized, as it is the centrifugal 
force that will give the power to the kick. And unlike the spin-back back kick (Chapter 4, Section 3) for example, there is 
no stopping the momentum here to switch to a straight line of attack—the spin continues through the target!
Although it is powerful and therefore effi  cient with the legs or the body as targets, the preferred target of this kick 
is the head. When attacking high, it is important not to start to lift  the leg early in the spin, but at the last instant 
(See Figure 5.4.3), so as to ensure the climbing of the leg outside the fi eld of vision of the opponent.

188   CHAPTER FIVE
Key Points
Do not telegraph your move by an exaggerated spin involving the arms: Use the discreet but forceful spin of the 
• 
shoulders to “pull” the waist and leg.
Avoid stopping the spin aft er 360 degrees twist: You have to kick through the target, and then stop by bending the leg.
• 
Minimize the time you lose eye contact with the opponent.
• 
Targets
As mentioned, the kick is very powerful from the accelerating circular movement and can be used on all possible targets. 
Th e head is preferred though, as the unexpectedness of the impact (kick not seen coming) oft en and easily causes knock-
downs and knock-outs.
Typical Application
Th e spin-back hook kick is most optimally used, in our opinion, as a counterattack kick. Figures 5.4.12 through 5.4.15 
shows the classic block/control of a high roundhouse, followed smoothly by a spin-back hook kick while the assailant is 
still lowering his kicking leg. It is to be noted that the block is already part of the spinning move.

Figures 5.4.18 to 5.4.21 show drilling the kick with a moving partner holding a target pad.
• 
Specific Training
Th is kick must be practiced for power on the heavy bag, and for speed and accuracy on the speedball. In order to 
• 
develop the skill of kicking opponents at all ranges, it is wise to always practice both regular and hooked versions 
during the same training session.
Practice on both the heavy bag and the speedball, with a chair in front: You start climbing just before you touch the 
• 
chair (See Figures 5.4.16 and 5.4.17).

Self-defense
Figures 5.4.22 through 5.4.26 show an off ensive application of the kick. 
An off ensive spin back kick is better delivered to an “immobilized” 
opponent, and in this case, you will put him off -balance for the time needed 
to kick him. Overwhelm your assailant with an aggressive jab/cross (Kizami 
tsuki / Gyacku tsuki, karate) combination to the face with a strong forward 
momentum. Make use of the twist of the hips to pull your rear leg into an 
inside kick/sweep (Ko uchi gari / De ashi bara—judo / karate) of his front 
leg to his outside. Continue this circular momentum and accelerate into a 
full spin-back hook kick to the head of your unbalanced assailant.

5.5 The Universal Chamber Hook Kick
General
Th is kick, as expected, is simply the regular front leg hook kick delivered from the universal chambering 
position already described (Chapter 2, Section 4, and Chapter 3, Section 4) and presented once more in 
Figure 5.5.1. Th e kick has all the advantages and disadvantages of the front leg hook kick, coupled with 
the eff ect of surprise conferred by the universal chamber: Th e opponent does not know if the kick on its 
way is side, roundhouse or hook.

Figures 5.5.2 through 5.5.6 describe the kick preceded by a half-step with a small hop, and with a hooked fi nish. 
Of course, the footwork can be diff erent and the fi nish can be straight-legged.

Key Points
Keep the guard up.
• 
Perform the chamber perfectly: only a perfect technique will fool the opponent. If you “prepare” your specifi c kick 
• 
when chambering, even slightly, you are telegraphing your intentions. It is a common mistake.
Kick through the target.
• 
Targets
Just like the regular front leg hook kick, this kick is not powerful. Kick only to the head or the groin.
Typical Application
Figures 5.5.7 through 5.5.12 present a very fast and effi  cient combination. You attack your opponent with a rather 
unusual reverse midsection punch/high jab (Gyacku tsuki / Kizami tsuki—karate) with full step and a committed 
forward momentum. Make sure that your high jab comes convincingly to the outside of his face to force him to 
overblock. Leave your jabbing hand when he blocks and try to get a hold of his hand. In any case, leave your hand in 
front of his face, slightly to the outside, to hide your next move as much as possible. Make use of the momentum and the 
hip twist of the front hand jab to “pull” the back leg forward in a slide, while lift ing your forward leg into the universal 
chamber. Hook kick to the inside of his face while pulling on his front hand if you have it. You then chamber the leg and 
lower it in front of him, between his own legs, while your hand releases his to come behind his neck. Sweep his front 
leg from under him by lift ing your front leg between his, all the while pushing him down from behind his neck (Uchi 
mata—judo). In tournament fi ghting you still have to make another point by hitting him while he is down.

HOOK KICKS   191
Specific Training
All universal chamber kicks must be practiced in front of the mirror.
• 
Always train all three types in the same session (side kick, roundhouse kick, hook kick), and train alternating them.
• 
Heavy bag training, from the good technical universal chamber, forces you to properly diff erentiate the three types.
• 
Self-defense
Figures 5.5.13 through 5.5.19 present a “simple” front leg hook kick as a timing stop-kick, but with a universal 
chamber, and followed by a punishing combination suitable for real self-defense. As already mentioned, the front leg 
hook kick is considered by this author to be one of the best kicks for stop-kicking an advancing opponent. As your 
assailant starts to attack you, do not retreat but hop forward into a universal chamber, well guarded, and initiate your 
hook kick. Kick through the target and chamber. From the chamber, and without lowering your leg, deliver a (small) 
roundhouse (Chapter 3, Section 2) to his groin, and then backfi st him while lowering the leg forward. Finish off  with 
another quick front leg hook kick, but this time, hooked, to hit him behind the head. No need for a universal chamber 
for the last hook kick.

5.6 The Oblique Hook Kick
General
Angling the trajectory of your kicks is always a good idea: Anything out of the ordinary has a better chance to succeed 
by surprising your opponent. Th e oblique hook kick is especially suitable for an oblique delivery as it lends itself easily 
to a longer trajectory. It is even more powerful than the regular hook kick, as it has a longer trajectory for circular 
acceleration. Th e technique is basically a longer trajectory back leg hook kick delivered aft er a forward oblique half-step 
evasion. Th e half step forward can be an evasion from an incoming attack, or just footwork to better fool the opponent. 
We have found this technique to be very eff ective as it easily fools unseasoned opponents.
Description
See Figures 5.6.1 through 5.6.6. From the fi ghting stance, perform a half-step obliquely forward with the front foot, 
and so remove your body completely from the centerline (or the line of a coming assault). As soon as your foot touches 
the ground, chamber the rear leg for a hook kick, as if it was to be delivered to an opponent standing in front of your 

192   CHAPTER FIVE
angled position. Th e hip movement involved will help fool your opponent, will protect you and will allow for a more 
powerful kick. Start to develop your hook kick and keep the accelerating circular momentum until you have hit through 
the target, which is a little bit further away than for the regular hook kick. Of course, the kick can be delivered hooked or 
straight-leg.
For better understanding, Figures 5.6.7 through 5.6.10 show the delivery of the kick against a step-punching opponent.

Key Points
Th e kick is delivered in one smooth continuous move.
• 
Be careful when stepping forward and stay guarded.
• 
Deliver the kick as if your opponent stands diagonally 45 degrees in front of 
• 
you. Picture this in your mind when training.
Targets
Th e kick is more powerful than the regular hook kick and can be used to kick 
the solar plexus or the kidneys. However, the preferred targets are still the head 
and the groin. Th e angle of attack also allows for a throat attack.

 
HOOK KICKS   193
Typical Application
As mentioned, this kick is most suitable for delivery against an opponent committed to an attack on you. Figures 5.6.11 
through 5.6.14 show the kick used against a front leg roundhouse, but it can be adapted to most attacking moves. 
As your opponent starts to launch a front leg hopping roundhouse, step obliquely forward to his inside for the oblique 
hook kick. He did not plan for a “longer” roundhouse, but you should still keep your guard up to control it.

Practice the kick as a timing stop-kick, against a heavy bag swung by a partner (see Figure 5.6.16).
• 
Specific Training
Mark the fl oor for the 45 degrees half-step and mark the bag 45 degrees to the back. Touch the marked fl oor with the 
• 
step and hit the mark on the back of the bag in one smooth movement (see Figure 5.6.15).

Self-defense
Figures 5.6.17 through 5.6.20 show the forward half-step as a full-scale forward evasion against an overhead club strike. 
Th e following hook kick will catch the assailant on the back of the neck. As this is a self-defense situation, keep hitting 
until safe, and therefore make use of the momentum of the lowering of the leg to hit the back of his head again with a 
hammer fi st strike.

194   CHAPTER FIVE
5.7 The Half-pivot Hook Kick
General
Just like the previous kick, this is a hook kick delivered aft er evasion footwork. Th ose kicks are presented here because 
the footwork changes the way the kick is performed—these are not just steps followed by the kick. Th e half-pivot hook 
kick is a hook kick delivered aft er a quarter of a turn pivot on the front foot that brings you to the outside of the mid-
line, very much in the way of the Tai-sabaki of aikido. Some karate styles like Shukokai and Sankukai are very fond 
of those types of evasion moves, especially circular ones. Th is kick is nearly exclusively to be used on an attacking 
opponent who is committed to a straight forward momentum. However, it could be used as an angled attack in certain 
circumstances, but with a smaller step, which makes it close to a front-leg hook kick delivered with a cross-step. 
Th is kick requires a lot of training, but is a must to practice for the stop-kicker.
Description
Figures 5.7.1 through 5.7.4 clearly show the circular pivot on the front foot and the rear leg executing more than a 
90 degrees circle. You stand perpendicular to your attacking opponent, with your rear leg “crossed” behind the front. 
Deliver a hook kick with the front leg into the line of attack.

HOOK KICKS   195
As with all stop-kicks, work on the swinging bag.
• 
Work with an attacking partner using padded targets and/or protection.
• 
For more clarity, Figures 5.7.5 through 5.7.8 show the delivery of the kick in a hooked heel version aft er an evading 
block against a step-punching opponent.
Figure 5.7.5 
Figure 5.7.6 
Figure 5.7.7 
Figure 5.7.8
Notice how unexpected the kick is.
Key Points
Th is is a continuous move. Th ere is no pause between 
• 
the footwork and the kick.
Keep your guard up and control your opponent’s 
• 
momentum.
Targets
Th e power of the kick is multiplied by the forward 
momentum of the opponent, and therefore powerful 
enough to target the solar plexus as well. However, 
the preferred targets still are the head and the groin.
Typical Application
Th e kick being a timing stop-kick, the applications will be quite straightforward. Figures 5.7.9 through 5.7.11 show the 
technique against a punch, like before, but this time with no block.
Figure 5.7.9 
Figure 5.7.10

Evasion only, no block. Timing is of the essence!
Specific Training
Mark the heavy bag at head level and stand in front of the mark. Evade and kick the mark.
• 
Repeat with chair between you and the bag (see Figure 5.7.12).

196   CHAPTER FIVE
5.8 The Downward Hook Kick
Furyo tshagy (taekwondo)
General
Th e downward hook kick is a hybrid between a hook kick and a downward heel kick (hatchet kick, axe kick—see 
Chapter 6, Section 5). Instead of being fully circular, the kick comes down obliquely toward the target. Th is is sort 
of the counterpart of the downward roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, Section 8), but coming from the other direction. 
Th e downward hook kick has the same advantages, however, one rarely expects to be kicked from above, and the fi nal 
trajectory of the kick easily surprises the opponent. Th is is also a great kick against ducking opponents, as you follow his 
downward evasion with the kick. Th e kick could also be considered a variation of the downward heel kick (Chapter 6, 
Section 5), but with your body facing sideways instead of forward. In any case, just as with all hybrid-type kicks, there 
are an infi nite numbers of possible variations of the kick: With more or less emphasis on the “hook” or the “downward” 
part of the kick. Th e kick also allows for a more “facing” fi nish position, than the regular hook kick terminating with the 
body facing sideways with less visibility.
Description
Figures 5.8.1 through 5.8.8 show the delivery with the rear leg, although the kick can be delivered with the front leg 
or aft er any suitable footwork. Th e delivery of the kick is totally similar to the regular hook kick until the start of 
the extension of the leg. With the extension of the leg, the hips start to pivot back forward to face the opponent. At 
full extension, and just before impact, the foot is pointing 45 degrees toward the ceiling and the hips are diagonal in 
reference to the midline. Th e kick comes down diagonally 45 degrees through the target. Th e leg then recoils, while the 
hips continue their pivot back toward chambered position.

Self-defense
Figures 5.7.13 through 5.7.15 show the technique used against a front-kicking assailant. Note the guard and the control 
of the kicking leg. Th e kick is delivered as the assailant lowers his leg.

 
HOOK KICKS   197
Key Points
Th e kick is coming downwards and therefore must 
• 
come from higher than the opponent’s head.
A lot of hip fl exibility work is needed.
• 
Th e shift  in the hips and start of downward movement 
• 
comes as late as possible in the kick execution, so as not 
to telegraph your intentions.
Targets
Head and neck
• 
Back of the neck
• 
Back and kidneys, if your opponent is bent-over.
• 
Typical Application
Figures 5.8.13 through 5.8.17 show a great application 
of the kick in an off ensive combination, also applicable 
to the regular hook kick. Feint a front leg low inside small roundhouse attack toward the front leg or the groin of your 
opponent. You can just feint or, preferably, get to the point where you touch the leg or the groin with a fast convincing 
kick. Th is is a great opening move against an opponent jabbing his attackers, as your slight backward tilt and high guard 
protect you when kicking. As soon as you get his attention to his low/inside gate, recoil the leg and pivot slightly for 
a high downward hook kick coming from the outside. Th is is especially eff ective if your feint has caused him to bend 
forward, but is equally eff ective if not, just because of the angle of attack.

Figure 5.8.8
Front view of the downward hook kick in comparison to the regular hook kick.
Figures 5.8.9 through 5.8.12 show an interesting combination using this particular kick: a straight leg roundhouse to 
the inside of your opponent’s knee joint causes him to open and kneel. You then use your kicking leg to come back with 
a downward hook kick to his neck while he is still down.

198   CHAPTER FIVE
Self-defense
Figures 5.8.19 through 5.8.24 show the use of the kick on a bending opponent. Your assailant is a counter-attacker, and 
you lure him into a reverse punch by launching a rear leg front kick (toward his groin) that is not totally committed and 
which is purposely to force him to block and counter. As soon as he blocks you recoil the leg and land the foot largely 
on the outside while controlling his punch. Th e momentum liberates your rear leg as you shift  your weight forward, 
and in one smooth, continuous move you roundhouse kick his ribs, his solar plexus or lower belly under the punching 
arm. Chamber the leg back as he bends over, and without lowering the leg, deliver a downward hook kick to the back of 
his head or neck.
Specific Training
Perform a lot of hip fl exibility training.
• 
You need to train on a target you can hit diagonally from above—a standing heavy bag, for example (see Figure 5.8.18).

5.9 The Bent-body Hook Kick
General
Th e bent-body hook kick is a very simply a hook kick delivered with the upper body bent sideways, more than 
warranted by fl exibility: Th e body is nearly parallel to the fl oor. It is presented as a separate kick because its delivery 
is slightly diff erent, and the kick is very useful in practice. Th e orthodox delivery of the kick calls for the body to 
bend during the extension of the leg, just like for the regular kick, but to a greater degree. In practice, the kick is oft en 
delivered from an already bent position, as will be illustrated in the applications. Th e obvious advantage of the kick is 
upper body evasion—kick while keeping your upper body away from an attack or a potential attack/counterattack. 
Th is is an extremely eff ective and versatile kick, as it is fast and very safe to deliver. Th is kick allows for kicking a very 
close opponent, in a very unexpected manner. It allows less fl exible artists to kick high to the head, by bending the body 
very low, even to the extent of placing the hand to the fl oor (See Section 11 of this chapter). We have seen this kick used 
by a great master like Shotokan’s Kanazawa, and referred to as the “scorpion” kick. In its delivery from very close, a less 
fl exible practitioner can use the forward ankle or thigh of the opponent as a support (See Figures 5.9.1 through 5.9.4)

Figure 5.9.2 
Figure 5.9.3 
Figure 5.9.4
Using the opponent’s leg as support.
Description
Figures 5.9.5 through 5.9.8 show the orthodox delivery of the rear leg version of the bent-body hook kick. You just bend 
over with the upper body during the development of a regular hook kick. Th e kick can, of course, be practiced in its 
front leg version, and with or without a “hooked” fi nish.

Key Points

Typical Application
Figures 5.9.15 through 5.9.19 present a very special application of this kick, 
which was automatically used by this author against those fi ghters who tried 
to “time-stop” his attacks with the once very popular jumping backfi st strike 
(Figure 5.9.14). Th is maneuver is not really a kick in the sense that the kick 
itself does not cause harm or hurt where it strikes; but the kick causes a hard 
fall to the opponent and allows for an eff ective follow-up. 
Feint with a half-step forward and a fake body move, to convince your opponent 
that you are launching a committed punching attack. As he jumps up (and slightly 
forward) start to bend away from him while bringing your rear leg half a step 
forward for a hopping front leg hook kick. Deliver the straight leg hook kick to 
his upper thighs while he is still in the air (but cannot reach your face as you are 
bending away), removing the support on which he expected to land. Th is is a hard 
fall, and you make use of his distress to score as soon as he slams the fl oor: 
You can heel kick him, or even just punch.
Figure 5.9.9 shows how the kick scores while the upper body is out of reach of a punch 
by the opponent.
Figures 5.9.10 through 5.9.13 show the same advantage against a stop-punching 
opponent, in a front-leg high bent-body hook kick.

HOOK KICKS   201
Specific Training
Train for fl exibility and practice the regular hook kick.
• 
Train with a partner in punching position (Figure 5.9.9)—kick while keeping away from the fi st.
• 
Train with a punching partner: You evade his punch by bending and hook kicking.
• 
Self-defense
Figures 5.9.20 through 5.9.23 show an application in which the kick is unorthodox as it starts from a bent position. 
Th is is a follow-up of a blocked front kick, and is valid whether the kick is a purposeful feint or has failed. Deliver a 
forceful and forward committed penetrating front kick. Your assailant evades the kick from the outside and diverts it to 
your inside. In order to avoid the coming counterattack, lower your kicking foot as far away from him on your inside as 
possible while you bend forward. Remain bent forward while switching your weight to the front leg and starting a hook 
kick to his head from the rear leg.

5.10 The Bent-body Spin-back Hook Kick
Meia lua de compasso / Chibata / Rabo de arraia (capoeira)
General
Th is is, of course, the spin-back version of the body bent hook kick. Th is is a kick very much in use in capoeira, and their 
typical variation is illustrated in Figure 5.10.10: a very large circular movement and with the upper body totally bent,

This is a very nasty fall! Practice carefully and exclusively on a mat.

202   CHAPTER FIVE
Typical Application
Figures 5.10.8 through 5.10.11 show a capoeira-style application of the kick. Spin and bend fully while still on both of 
your feet, then kick while completing the spin. Look at your opponent from down under. In the application, the kick is 
used against a counter-puncher: You feint with half a reverse punch to provoke his reverse punching. You then reverse 
Figures 5.10.5 through 5.10.7 show the delivery of the kick with a partner.
Figure 5.10.5 
Figure 5.10.6 
Figure 5.10.7
Note how bending over makes this a very safe kick.
Key Points
Kick through the target.
• 
Speed is key to the power of the kick: practice for a 
• 
smooth accelerating kick. Muscles of the leg must be 
relaxed for speed and fl exibility.
Keep maximum eye contact with the opponent: regain 
• 
eye contact as early as possible in the spin.
Targets
Preferable targets are the head and the groin. But this is 
a powerful kick, so the kidneys, solar plexus, middle of 
the back, side of the thigh, and the knee are good 
alternative targets.

as to allow looking at the opponent from down under. Th e advantage of the bent-body spin-back hook kick comes from 
being away from the opponent as much as possible, combined with the power of the centrifugal force of the spin back 
rotation. Th e bending of the upper body while pivoting adds to the power of the circular movement. Of course, bending 
the upper body also allows for higher kicking if fl exibility limits the height of your kicks.
Description
Figures 5.10.1 through 5.10.4 show the orthodox way to practice the kick. You start just like for a regular spin-back 
hook kick (Section 4 of this chapter) by turning the head and shoulders fi rst, then the hips. As soon as you start 
pivoting on your foot and turning the hips, you also start bending the upper body. At the apex of the kick, your body 
is about parallel to the fl oor. 

 
HOOK KICKS   203
your momentum and the direction of the pivot of the hips, bending while spinning back to use the full momentum of 
the spin and bend to throw a fast kick.
5.11 The Hand-on-the-floor Hook Kick
General
Th is kick is the natural evolution of the bent-body hook kick, taken a little bit further. It is presented separately though, 
because of the way that the hand touches the fl oor, which allows for a slightly diff erent delivery. As part of the body 
weight can be switched to the hand, the kick is lighter, faster and better anchored. Th e kick has the same advantage as 
the bent-body hook kick: the body is away from the opponent while the kick is fast, surprising and easy to perform high. 
Specific Training
Th is kick must be practiced on the heavy bag, but for speed.
• 
Practice with a partner roundhouse-punching at head level to force you to bend.
• 
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations show an example of the kick in its more punishing “hooked” form, and as a natural follow-up 
to a classic tai-sabaki type of evasion as practiced in aikido or in karate styles such as Sankukai or Wado ryu. Th e body-
bending is used to keep the body away from the assailant, as he is armed with a knife. You are suddenly attacked by an 
assailant stabbing with a knife toward your belly, and turn naturally to his outside while evading the middle line 
(Figure 5.10.13). Your naturally-hanging arm blocks and controls the attacking arm while you make use of the 
momentum of your circular movement (Tai-sabaki) and accelerate into a spin-back. You start bending as early as 
possible while delivering the kick to the back of his head (Figure 5.10.14). As you are staying very close to him while 
evading to his back and away from the straight line of attack, you must hook the fi nishing part of the hook kick. 
Continue your pivot while lowering the leg and regain control of his attacking arm. If possible, you can hit his elbow 
joint with your open hand while hitting his wrist from the inside, as illustrated (Figure 5.10.15). In any case, you keep 
control of his armed arm, while inverting your circular momentum, pushing him backward by pressing his throat and 
sweeping his front leg in an outer reap throw (O soto gari—judo). See Figure 5.10.16.

204   CHAPTER FIVE
Key Points
Th e hand leans fi rmly on the fl oor 
• 
and takes on part of the body 
weight.
Use your “lighter” weight on your 
• 
foot to accelerate the circular 
kicking motion.
Keep your eyes on your opponent 
• 
at all times.
Lean back up with your hands in 
• 
guard.
Targets
Preferably the head.
• 
Possibly the groin and knee.
• 
Typical Application
Figures 5.11.7 through 5.11.10 show the use of the kick as a “counterattack trap.” Th is is an excellent move to use against 
a “wait, block and counter” type of opponent, especially if he is not easily fooled by fake half-punches. You launch a fully 
committed rear leg roundhouse to his kidneys, keeping your upper body relaxed and your head leveled. Th is kick is 
diffi  cult to block, and the combination stays the same whether your kick connects, is blocked, or partially blocked. 
You chamber back while keeping your momentum to lower the leg back crossed-legged in front of you. As your 
opponent launches his reverse punch counter, you bend down (same momentum!) and launch back the hook kick with 
the same leg, while laying the opposite hand on the fl oor. Your body is away from his punch, but your foot easily reaches 
his head from an unexpected angle.

Bending toward the ﬂ oor helps lift the leg higher if needed.
Figures 5.11.5 and 5.11.6 show how this kick can be delivered to the head even at zero range, in an extremely 
surprising way.
Th e way that the hand is fi rmly on the fl oor allows for more stability and fast combinations. Th e kick can, of course, 
be delivered with the front or the rear leg, and in its regular or “hooked” form.
Description
Figures 5.11.1 through 5.11.4 show the kick delivered as a front leg hopping kick. You front leg hop, and as soon as the 
kicking leg starts to rise like a regular hook kick, start to bend the upper body back. Th e hand should get to the fl oor 
just before the kick gets to full extension and scores. Aft er hitting, you can follow up from the hand-on-fl oor position or 
chamber back into an upright position.

5.12 The Hand-on-the-floor Spinning Back Hook Kick
Meia lua de compasso (capoeira)
General
We have given this kick its capoeira name as it is typical of this art and very frequently used in their jogo (game). 
Th e capoeira version of this kick is delivered in a diff erent way, more specifi c to the emphasis of this style, and we will 
show both deliveries. Th e kick in itself is the natural continuation of the principles behind the bent-body spinning back 
hook kick (Section 10 of this chapter), just a little farther away with the upper body until the hand lies on the fl oor. 
Again, the advantages of the kick are the same: faster because of some body weight on the hand, safer as upper body is 
away from opponent, surprising eff ect because the kick is unorthodox and easier to deliver high for less fl exible people.
Description
Figures 5.12.1 through 5.12.5 show the more orthodox delivery, which is closer to the Japanese and Korean traditional 
kicking arts. As you start pivoting on yourself just like for a regular spin back hook kick (Section 4 of this chapter),

This technique is based on the bending over to evade the counterpunch.
Specific Training
Practice on the heavy bag, or any target, for form and speed. Th ere is no need to work on power.
• 
Practice on heavy bag with chair between you and the bag.
• 
Practice with a partner counterpunching when you start kicking, to force you to bend and evade (See Figure 5.11.10).
• 
Alternate with the regular hook kick and its hand-on-fl oor version.
• 
Self-defense
Figures 5.11.11 through 5.11.14 show one of the best self-defense applications for kick use in close combat. Th is can 
be applied to many situations. In this example, you block/evade a punch on the outside of your assailant, always an 
advantageous position. You follow up in a classic circular move to his solar plexus, smoothly passing under his punching 
arm, and hitting with the ridge or the hand (Haito uchi—karate) or the closed fi st. You keep the momentum to start a 
rear leg hook kick. As you are close, the hook kick is better and safer with the hand on the fl oor and with a “hooked” 
fi nish to the back of his head.

Figure 5.12.9 
Figure 5.12.10
Front view of the capoeira-like version of the kick.
Key Points
Th is is a smooth and continuous movement.
• 
Power comes from speed and therefore muscles must be relaxed.
• 
Acceleration of the kick comes from starting the pivot from the head down, and relieving the standing leg from some 
• 
of the body weight.
Always kick through the target.
• 
Targets
Centrifugal force turns this kick in an extremely powerful one. Kick the head or groin preferably, but back, kidney, solar 
plexus, lower belly, knees, thighs are great targets if you use the heel as connecting surface.
Typical Application
Figures 5.12.11 through 5.12.14 show an interesting example of the kick as a follow-up to an outside lower block (Gedan 
barai—karate) to an incoming committed front kick attack. As you evade the kick forward and on the outside of the 
opponent while he has to lower his kicking leg, you are close enough for a punch follow-up. Th erefore you bend away 
from the opponent while delivering the kick upward from below his punching arm. Th is is an extremely successful and 
surprising maneuver against a front kicker.
Figures 5.12.6 through 5.12.10 show the capoeira-like version of the kick, lighter on your feet, faster, more relaxed and 
“jumpy.” Spin back and bend simultaneously in order to achieve, as quickly as possible, a fully bent position, with one 
or two hands fi rmly on the fl oor, and with your back to the opponent. Of course, you do not stop in this position and it 
is only a milestone in a continuous and accelerating movement. From there, keep your circular spin-back momentum 
and switch some weight onto the hand(s) to start a straight leg hook kick with what was your rear leg. Kick through the 
target and continue with your circular movement while standing up.

Figure 5.12.4 
Figure 5.12.5
Fast and ﬂ ourishingly beautiful kick.
you immediately combine the spinning with a downward move of the upper body until your hand lies on the fl oor. 
Your hand should touch the fl oor and take on some of your weight, just before you leg gets at full extension and hits the 
target aft er a 360 degrees turn, at full centrifugal force.

 
HOOK KICKS   207
5.13 The Oblique Spin-back Hook Kick
General
Th is is simply a spin-back hook kick preceded by evading footwork. It is presented separately as a kick because the 
footwork causes some diff erences in the delivery of the kick, as the arc traveled by the kick is shorter than with a regular 
spin-back hook kick. Because of the starting position of the kick, the foot travels less than a full half-circle to reach the 
target. Th e move in itself is very confusing to the opponent, as you fully leave the mid-line, or the eventual line of attack, 
to fi nally kick from an unexpected angle. Th e evading footwork can be used either as an attack or as an evasion from 
a straight attack. Practicing this version of the hook kick is important, as it helps build your ability to kick from many 
diff erent positions relative to your opponent.
Description
Figures 5.13.1 through 5.13.5 show how to perform a long step forward at an inside 45 degrees with your front foot, 
and so removing your body from the mid-line. You then switch your weight onto the front foot and bend a little more 
out of the mid-line, while starting your spin-back. Pivot from the head down, like a regular spin-back hook kick and 
fi nally kick through the target, which is still on the mid-line. Th e spin back is shorter, which makes the kick faster, more 
surprising, but also less powerful.

Specific Training
Refer to Specifi c Training for the bent-body spin back hook kick (Section 10 of this chapter) and hand-on-fl oor hook 
kick (Section 11 of this chapter).
Self-defense
Th e following images illustrate a more capoeira-like delivery of the kick, but in an application suitable for regular 
delivery as well. Th is is a great kick to use against a fi ghter waiting to time-stop you with a front leg roundhouse kick. 
Aft er you have ascertained that it is his special fi ghting technique, feint half a reverse punch to provoke him into starting 
his kick (Figure 5.12.16). Reverse your hip momentum and spin-back bend to place your hands on the fl oor (Figure 
5.12.17). You are already below his chambering leg. Continue your spin back momentum to deliver a high hook kick just 
as he completes his kick into void. Kick through his head before you start straightening up (Figure 5.12.18).
Figure 5.12.11 
Figure 5.12.12 
Figure 5.12.13 
Figure 5.12.14
The bending keeps you safe and the circular move allows for an accelerating kick.

208   CHAPTER FIVE
Key Points
Th e key to the success of the technique is the evading step forward, which 
• 
must be fast, untelegraphed (same head height), and long enough to take 
you immediately out of the line of attack.
Keep your eyes on the opponent while stepping and start bending together 
• 
with the step.
Make it one smooth move—the kick starts with the step and the spin back 
• 
starts as soon as the stepping foot touches the fl oor.
Targets
Typical targets include the head and the groin. Th e kick is less powerful than 
the regular spin-back hook kick, but still powerful enough for use to the solar 
plexus or the knees.
Figures 5.13.6 through 5.13.9 show the delivery of the kick in a combination starting with an out-of-centerline 
lunging backfi st on the outside of the opponent, laying the groundwork for the kick coming on his inside.

HOOK KICKS   209
Typical Application
Figures 5.13.10 through 5.13.12 show the use of the kick as an attack, following one of our preferred opening moves: 
a fast backfi st attack delivered while lunging forward and to the outside of the opponent. Th e forward lunge must be 
untelegraphed and long, while you try to land your forward foot behind his own, on the outside. To avoid telegraphing, 
the backfi st starts toward his head a few milliseconds before you start your lunge. As you land, you are in the natural 
position to lunge your oblique spin-back hook kick from his blind angle!
Self-defense
Figures 5.13.14 through 5.13.17 show a defensive application of the kick blending naturally in the evading move. 
As you are assailed by a telegraphed front kick, you evade to your outside, while blocking/controlling your attacker’s leg 
from the inside. If possible, control the leg to slightly overextend his kick into an off -balanced landing. All the while you 
deliver your oblique spin-back hook kick, on which he will practically impale himself. Natural follow-ups to the kick are 
a backfi st to the face, and a low stomping side kick to the inside of his knee.

Specific Training
It is useful to practice the kick on the heavy bag, with the midline indicated on the fl oor, as well as a taped cross 
• 
signaling the step to be taken. You’ll then start from a fi ghting stance farther and farther away from the cross.
Repeat the exercise with a chair between you and the bag. Th is will force you to take a full lunge step, and lift  the leg 
• 
early in the kick. (Figure 5.13.13)
Always practice the regular spin-back hook kick aft er working on the oblique version!

Key Points
Th e power of the kick comes exclusively from the accelerating circular movement: You therefore need to lift  and 
• 
straighten the leg early and make the largest circular move possible.
Keep your eyes on your opponent at all times.
• 
Kick through the target, but do not overstretch your kick, as you then become extremely vulnerable.
• 
Strike with the heel—not the calf or the sole of the foot.
• 
5.14 The Drop Hook Kick
General
Th e drop hook kick is not a very powerful kick, and therefore not very much in use. Well-timed and executed it can still 
be an interesting weapon in your arsenal. In order to be able to use the kick in real situations, you will need to practice it 
a lot to allow for speed, deception, as much power as possible, and accuracy. Th e kick can be useful as a sweep to throw 
down your opponent, or as a “timing” stop kick to the groin coming in the opposite direction of the adversary’s kick 
(See Figure 5.14.18). We shall still consider the kick used as a “sweep,” a real kick, because it is always best delivered so: 
hit as hard as possible, with the heel, in order to infl ict damage to the side of the knee, the calf or the side of the ankle; 
the fall of the opponent is a positive by-product.
Description
Figures 5.14.1 through 5.14.5 show the orthodox delivery of the kick: As the kick is not suitable for an attack, you need 
to step back and bend to the fl oor, pivoting on your rear foot. Th is is basically a downward/rear evasion. Place your 
hands and what was your back knee on the fl oor, and start kicking with your “previously front leg that stepped back” and 
that is now free of your body weight. Th is is very much a rebounding of the foot, as soon as your hands and knee lean on 
the fl oor. Th e development of the kick is circular, parallel to the fl oor.

 
HOOK KICKS   211
Typical Application
Although it is not very much used in attacks, we present an exception, 
in order to show the opposite footwork which gets us in the same coiled 
position: Instead of step-pivoting back with the front leg, you can cross-step 
forward with your rear foot behind the front and bend down to the fl oor. Th e 
combination illustrated in Figures 5.14.10 through 5.14.13 will be effi  cient if you have drilled the kick a lot and if you 
make sure you kick with the heel onto sensitive points of your opponent’s leg (Th e side of the knee is ideal). 
Th e stepping forward to get into coiled position is possible by your simultaneously delivery of a feinted backfi st that will 
keep him busy and slightly off -balance. A feinted backfi st is a continuous movement starting as a convincing straight 
punch toward the groin that turns into a high outside backfi st. As soon as the backfi st is delivered, forcefully drop to the 
fl oor into a coiled position and kick the side of his knee. Kick through to ensure pain and the fall of the opponent.

Figure 5.14.11 
Figure 5.14.12 
Figure 5.14.13
These images depict an offensive combination, resulting in a takedown when delivered with precision.
Specific Training
Th e best way to drill the kick as a real punishing low kick is to deliver it to a 
• 
medicine-ball (as heavy as possible) for power and a basketball for speed and 
accuracy. See Figure 5.14.14. Make sure you hit with the heel, as hard as possible 
(Sending the ball as far as possible).
Practice the kick at groin level on the heavy bag: Touch the bag in fi ghting stance and 
• 
deliver the kick, while emphasizing the spring-like rebounding of the kicking foot off  
the fl oor. See Figure 5.14.15.

5.15 The Drop Spin-back Hook Kick
Hadan dora cha gi (taekwondo), Hao so tung toy (kung fu), Rasteira giratoria (capoeira)
General
Th e drop spin-back hook kick is much more powerful than the simple drop hook kick, thanks to the centrifugal force 
and acceleration of the circular movement. Of course, it takes longer and there is some loss of eye contact during the 
spin back. Th is kick is very much in use, especially in Chinese arts as a sweep of the front leg or the standing leg during a 
kick. Th e delivery of the sweep and the kick being the same, it is recommended to always deliver it “kick-minded” and to 
try to always connect with the heel onto sensitive anatomical points. Th e result will be the same felling of the opponent, 
but with added punishment. Just like the simple drop hook, this kick is great to use against the open groin of a high-
kicking opponent.
Another advantage of this kick, when compared to the simple drop hook kick (Section 14 of this chapter), is that the 
bending down and footwork is already part of the kick itself and adds to the momentum of the circular movement.
Description
Figures 5.15.1 through 5.15.5 show the delivery of the kick. Start a regular spin-back, but immediately bend down with 
the legs and upper body. Continue the circular movement while the knee of the front leg and the hands reach the the 
fl oor. As soon as the body weight shift s from the rear leg, lift  it and start kicking, while still spinning back with your hips.

roundhouse kicking opponent.

Figure 5.14.18
An application at groin level.
Self-defense
Figures 5.14.16 through 5.14.18 present the classic use of the kick against a high roundhouse (Chapter 3, Section 1), with 
the orthodox step-back footwork. Th e kick is very effi  cient because of the target (groin) and the opposite directions of 
the two circular movements.

 
HOOK KICKS   213
Typical Application
Figures 5.15.10 through 5.15.12 show the classic use against a kicking opponent, 
as mentioned previously. Th is is an easy kick to score against a kicker, provided 
you have drilled it a lot, and time it perfectly. Th e drop into “coiled” position 
must be fast and forceful, nearly a “fall” into position. Th is move has the advantage of a total downward evasion of the 
kick without any need for footwork: you just drop in place into a position where you are not very vulnerable.
Figure 5.15.10 
Figure 5.15.11 
Figure 5.15.12
These images depict a devastating stop kick if executed with the right timing.
Figures 5.15.13 through 5.15.18 show a classic “sweep” combination including this kick, used a lot in tournaments 
of all styles. Th e move is great against fi ghters who lift  the front leg and close their guards against all attacks, covering 
themselves and stopping the body attacks on their limbs, waiting to counterattack. It is also a great combination attack in 
itself against all fi ghters—those who stand their ground, or those backing away. 
According to the fi ghter in front of you, you attack the standing leg, the front leg of a retreating opponent or even 
both legs. Just remember: always treat this as a kick, and not as a gentle sweep. And always follow up onto your falling 
opponent—a falling opponent is not vanquished yet!
Attack your opponent with a high reverse punch to put him off -balance and block his fi eld of vision. Use the hip momentum 
to throw a low sweeping kick to his forward ankle. Whether you succeed in hitting his ankle, or he succeeds in lift ing his knee, 
the combination stays the same. Lower the kicking foot while you keep the circular momentum into a drop spin-back hook 
kick. Kick the side of the knee of the rear leg on which he his standing or where he has his body weight, and follow-up.

Train on the heavy bag, but for speed, hitting at marked groin level.
• 
Practice kicking a medicine-ball and/or a basketball: Kick fast to send it as far as 
• 
possible (See Figure 5.15.19).
Self-defense
Figures 5.15.20 through 5.15.24 show an interesting use of the kick when you are yourself 
attacked with a low kick: Either you have been hit by a classical low-kick (Chapter 3, 
Section 7 and Chapter 8, Section 6) that bent your knee, or you have managed to partially absorb the kick by twisting 
and bending the knee and getting down on it. In any case, you fi nd yourself spinning back into coiled position for the 
drop spin-back hook kick. To make use of maximum power you kick the vital points on his rear leg with your heel: 
the knee, the calf or the ankle. Follow-up with body or head kicks when he falls down.

Figure 5.16.5
Side view of the drop spin-back downward hook kick.
Key Points
Try to practice the kick as a jumping kick: the twist is in the air.
• 
Th e twisting, kicking and falling down are one simultaneous movement.
• 
You kick down through the target and use the momentum of your body twist to power the trajectory.
• 
Always follow-up aft er the kick, as you are in a vulnerable position. His groin will usually be exposed to further 
• 
kicking (see Figures 5.16.8 through 5.16.13).
Always hit with the heel.
• 
Targets
Th e downward trajectory limits the targets to the vulnerable points of the head alone. Th e back of the neck is also a 
target, if the opponent is bent-over.

Figure 5.16.7
Front view: compare the regular and the downward hook kicks.
5.16 The Drop Spin-back Downward High Hook Kick
General
Th is kick is very similar to the previous drop spin-back hook kick, with the diff erence being that the trajectory of the 
kick switches to downwards just before impact. Th is requires changes in the preparation of the kick: a lower body, 
a higher leg and a longer twist of the hips during the kick. Th e kick is not easy to perform, and needs a lot of training to 
become powerful. It is, however, an extremely surprising kick, and useful for agile fi ghters who feel comfortable ground 
fi ghting. It is a close-combat kick, to the head but from the ground, which needs fast and committed body movements to 
allow for enough power to infl ict damage.
Description
Figures 5.16.1 through 5.16.7 show that in the beginning of the kick—which is identical to that of a regular drop spin-
back hook kick—you twist back and go down on the front knee in one smooth, uninterrupted and fast move. Th e rest 
of the kick, though, is one bursting and springy twist performed in an explosive way, very much like a fl ying kick. 
Just before your knee touches the fl oor, you already twist in the air in a high circular hook kick, while simultaneously 
receiving yourself on the hands and keeping the twisting momentum until you fi nd yourself nearly on your back. 
Th e apex of the kick is just before connecting with the target, and the heel strikes downward through the target. 

216   CHAPTER FIVE
Typical Application
Figures 5.16.8 through 5.16.13 show the typical off ensive application: Make use of an appropriate off ensive momentum 
in close combat. Attack your opponent with an un-telegraphed hopping front leg small roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, 
Section 2 and Chapter 3, Section 3) to the groin. Whether you score or just cause him to lower his guard is irrelevant 
to the rest of the combination. As you recoil and lower your kicking leg behind his front leg (using your forward and 
circular momentum), simultaneously jab his now unguarded face. Whether you connect or just keep him busy lift ing 
back his hands is not important to the rest of the combination: As soon as your foot reaches the fl oor, throw yourself 
into the kick, aiming for his face. As your other leg blocks at least his front leg, he will fall to the fl oor. Keep the twisting 
momentum of the kick to roll onto your back and kick him in the groin with the other leg while he is still falling.

Figure 5.16.10 
Figure 5.16.11
Figure 5.16.12 
Figure 5.16.13
These images depict a fantastic offensive combination for the springy ﬁ ghter.
Specific Training
Th is kick must be practiced (quite a bit) on a standing bag, in order to drill the twist in the air and the downward 
• 
trajectory. Th e standing bag can be held by a partner.
Always alternate with a regular drop spin-back hook kick (Section 15 of this chapter) when you practice the kick!
• 
When you have mastered the move on the bag, you must practice on a protected partner or one holding foam focus 
• 
pads, in order to drill the move at the right distance and on a realistic opponent.
Self-defense
Figures 5.16.14 through 5.16.17 show the use of the kick in defensive mode, aft er a downward evasion. Evade a power-
punching opponent’s attack by suddenly twisting down and landing, aft er your spin-back, onto your front knee. You are 
already, of course, delivering the drop downward high spin-back hook kick to his face. As this time, you fi nd yourself on 
the inside of his feet. You don’t provoke his fall, but keep your twisting momentum, and, from your back-on-the-fl oor 
position, launch a roundhouse kick to his head with the other leg.

HOOK KICKS   217
5.17 The Small Heel Back Hook Kick
General
Th is is a very simple but eff ective back kick, although conceivable as a variation of a short spin back hook kick too. 
It is encountered in some kung fu and pencak silat styles. Basically, it is a short bent leg “hooked-fi nish” hook kick, 
delivered usually to the groin of an opponent standing behind you. As the kick comes with a twist of the hips, it is also 
generally powerful enough to be used toward the solar plexus or the kidneys of an opponent. It is an important and easy 
kick to master, great for self-defense and close combat. It also teaches you to kick from any range and any position. 
Is your opponent too close for an effi  cient hook kick? Hit him with a short one!
Description
Figures 5.17.1 through 5.17.7 show the classic delivery of 
the kick, as a back kick: You look back and lift  the bent leg 
directly behind you, a little bit like a short back kick. 
Th e trajectory of the foot is up and around. Your hips 
pivot toward the opponent while you hit the target 
horizontally, and hook into the target.

Key Points
You lift  the leg back as it is, with no chambering: Th is is a fast, un-telegraphed kick.
• 
Most of the power of the kick comes from the hip movement: the leg stays half-bent up to the end. Th is is very much 
• 
like a hook punch driven by the body.
Only at impact do you start hooking the kick into the target.
• 
Use the heel only as the striking surface.
• 

218   CHAPTER FIVE
Targets
Preferably the groin.
• 
If the kick has been mastered and is powerful: the solar plexus and the kidneys. It then must be accurate and use the 
• 
heel only.
Typical Application
Figures 5.17.12 through 5.17.15 show the use of the kick when you fi nd yourself with your back, even if only partially, 
toward an attacking or counterattacking opponent. For example, your opponent has evaded your high roundhouse by 
leaning back and has succeeded in putting you off -balance by accelerating your momentum and pushing down your 
kicking leg. Or, as illustrated, he simply blocks your high hook kick. You fi nd yourself with your back to him as he 
prepares to counterattack with a reverse punch. Use your accelerated momentum to let your kicking leg rebound off  the 
fl oor, as if it has hit a spring, and hit your advancing opponent’s groin with a small heel back hook kick.
Specific Training
It is important to practice this kick on the heavy bag for power and 
the sense of distance: Stand in fi ghting stance with your back to 
the bag but touching it with your front hand extended backward. 
Explode into the kick, in one move, with no telegraphing, as 
powerfully as possible (Figures 5.17.16 and 5.17.17).
Self-defense
Of course, as a back kick, it is ideal to use in self-defense situations, 
when attacked from behind. Figures 5.17.18 through 5.17.20 show 
the use of the kick against an assailant coming behind you. Th e kick 
is fast and easy, and can be used as soon as you have turned your 
head and seen him. As soon as you have hit his groin, you complete 
your twist while backfi sting him in the now unprotected head.

HOOK KICKS   219
The Flying Spin Back Hook Kick
Ura mawashi tobi geri (karate)
Th is very spectacular and powerful kick is a favorite of action movies, and the bread-and-butter of Taekwondo 
tournaments, it is a very powerful because of the centrifugal force of a twisting body freed from the constraints of 
the ground.
The Sacrifice Spin Back Hook Kick
Although very similar to the drop spin-back downward high hook kick (Section 16 of this chapter), this scissor-type 
kick entails dropping to the fl oor from very close to the opponent. It is more of a takedown than a full-powered kick.
The Roundhouse Chamber Hook Kick
Th is is a great feint kick. It is an important kick to master for the kicking fi ghter, as it keeps the opponent on edge and 
guessing which kick will develop from any chambered position. Th e feinting move is self-explanatory here.
The Roundhouse to Spin Back Hook Kick Combination
Th is is, of course, a natural combination keeping the same circular momentum and accelerating it while kicking with 
one leg aft er the other. Th is is a must-practice combination. 
More Advanced Hook Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are beyond 
the scope of this book.
The Flying Hook Kick
Mawashi ushi tobi geri (karate)
Th e name of the kick is self-explanatory: it is basically a front leg hook kick delivered while jumping. As with all 
“fl ying” kicks, the jumping is not necessarily as high as possible, but also forward, or even backward. Th is kick is not 
very powerful, but its angle of attack can be relatively surprising.

CHAPTER SIX
Crescent Kicks
Th is chapter presents crescent kicks, outside crescent kicks and straight-leg downward kicks. All these 
kicks are straight leg kicks surprisingly coming to the opponent from his side or overhead. Th ese 
kicks are common to all ancient traditional styles, but not very much in use in modern sporting 
events. However, they are very useful kicks—fast and powerful, especially at close range—and wrongly 
underused. Of course, their close combat applications make them perfect kicks for self-defense.
 Some of the typical uses presented will suggest practical applications for the reader’s practice.
6.1 The Crescent Kick
Mikazuki geri / Soto mikazuki geri / Aori geri (karate), Nae mandal / Bandal cha gi (taekwondo), Yue liang jiao (kung fu), 
Meia lua de frente (capoeira), Th uong dao son / Dao phuong cuoc (viet vo dao)
General
Th e crescent kick is found in nearly all fi ghting styles, as it is probably the most versatile of all kicks: It can be used 
against a very close opponent, or at regular kicking distance. It can be delivered as a full power kick, with a 180 degree 
pivot of the hips, or as a fast, nearly straight front leg kick. It can be used as a full-fl edged attack, or as a block of an 
incoming punch or kick (See Figures 6.1.27 through 6.1.29). It can be used to open or weaken an opponent’s guard. 
It can be used against nearly all targets, from the face down to the groin, and including the limbs. It is a very common 
kick in most styles, ever-present in the capoeira “game” and taekwondo contests, very frequent in many kung fu styles, 
and the third most-encountered kick in traditional karate forms, aft er the front and side kick.
Figures 6.1.1 through 6.1.10 show the way it is practiced in the Heian Sandan and Heian Godan forms of Shotokan-
ryu karate.

Figure 6.1.10
This kata excerpt shows two crescent kicks found in the Heian Godan kata.
Th is is also the way, in our opinion, that it should be practiced in the beginning, in order to impart the right feeling of 
how to use the hips to generate power in this kick (Figures 6.1.11 through 6.1.16). Later on, the skilled practitioner will 
use the same power generating principles in a much shorter and faster kick (See Figures 6.1.18 through 6.1.26). 
Description
Figures 6.1.11 through 6.1.17 show the traditional full-power crescent kick: From a side horse stance (Kiba dachi—
karate, Ma bu—kung fu), extend the lead hand forward and hit the palm of the hand with the plant of the foot in a 
straight movement, while pivoting 180 degrees with the hips. When you lower the leg, you are in a side horse stance 
again, but with the other side forward.
Figure 6.1.11 
Figure 6.1.12 
Figure 6.1.13 
Figure 6.1.14 
Figure 6.1.15 
Figure 6.1.16
These illustrations depict a front and side view of a crescent kick. 
Once you have “mastered” the full-power traditional kick, start working on the following variation (of course, keep 
practicing the traditional one as well!). You now start from a fi ghting stance and launch your rear leg forward, nearly 
straight, in an arc with an apex that occurs just as it passes in front of your mid-line (see Figures 6.1.19  through 6.1.22 
and 6.1.24 through 6.1.26). You hit the target from the side, outward to inwards. You kick through the target, and aft er 
impact start to bend the leg, which can then be lowered in front, or into its original rear position. Th e wideness of the 
arc traveled by the foot is up to you: Th e wider it is, the more power you pack into the kick, but the longer it has to travel 
and the earlier it can be detected. If the arc is minimal, like a straight leg front kick with an added small sideward shift  
at the end, the kick will be less powerful, but very fast and very diffi  cult to detect because its trajectory is mostly out of 
your opponent’s vision range. It is key for the kicking fi ghter to practice both extremes, and be able to choose in a fi ght 
the amount of “arc” suitable to the situation.

As already mentioned, the kick is great to attack extended limbs. Figures 6.1.27 through 6.1.29 show its use to open 
an opponent’s guard by hurting the elbow joint, to stop and block a front kick by attacking the knee joint, and to block 
a punch while infl icting pain to the arm muscles. Certain styles, capoeira among them, emphasize a coiling of the plant 
of the foot when attacking the arm, in such a way that the foot somewhat molds itself around the attacked limb and 
“catches” it slightly.

how close to the opponent this kick 
can be eff ectively delivered.

Key Points
Th e hips are generating the power of the kick; the leg is just the extension of the hips. Always use the hips to pack as 
• 
much power as possible into the kick, even if it is a “fast” kick.
Pivot on your standing foot while kicking: from a 1/4 turn pivot in the “fast” kick, to a 1/2 turn pivot in the traditional 
• 
execution.
Always kick through the target. Th is is a kick that lends itself too easily to a “slapping” version with no follow-through 
• 
impact.
Th is kick brings you closer to the opponent than most kicks: Keep your guard up.
• 
Targets
As mentioned, the crescent kick can be used on most targets, especially in its powerful version: the head from all sides, 
the upper and lower back, the ribs and solar plexus, the groin, the knees, the arms from all sides from the wrists to the 
shoulders, and more.
Typical Application
Th e following images show a very effi  cient application that we like very much, one that is very effi  cient against a 
“standing” opponent, or one who likes to time-jab an incoming opponent. Th is application also shows how the crescent 
kick can be used against a very close opponent. Th e key to this combination lies in the explosiveness of your sudden lunge 
forward, as you stand in opposite stance to your opponent. As you burst forward, you use your front hand to control his 
lead hand, negate any possibility of a jab, and keep his attention focused there (Figure 6.1.37). While still in your forward 
momentum, you launch a full power rear leg crescent kick to the side of his face (Figure 6.1.38). You kick through and 
use your kicking momentum to keep pivoting while lowering your leg (Figure 6.1.39). Keep turning and accelerating 
to deliver a spin-back knife hand (or hammer fi st) strike to the side of his neck (Figure 6.1.40). Hit through and keep 
turning with your momentum  (Figure 6.1.41) to fi nish him off  with a roundhouse kick (same leg as the crescent kick), 
which is basically a very powerful 360 spin-back roundhouse kick (Chapter 3, Section 11). See Figure 6.1.42.

CRESCENT KICKS   227
Figure 6.1.40 
 Figure 6.1.41 
 Figure 6.1.42
Your explosive advance will allow you to control your opponent while you set up your crescent kick. A quick succession of different follow-up attacks 
will allow you to press your advantage. 
As this kick is very versatile, here is another typical application, showing its use as a guard-opening, joint-attacking 
technique. One should keep in mind that attacks to the guard or limbs will tire the opponent and cause his guard 
to lower or to recoil from further attacks. Th e following images show such an application, especially useful against 
opponents with a guard reaching “far out.” You attack his elbow straight out from the fi ghting stance, making sure you 
do not telegraph your intentions (Figure 6.1.44). You recoil the leg, without lowering it, into a side kick chambering 
(Figure 6.1.45), and you deliver a hopping side kick or back side kick to the body (Figure 6.1.46). If your opponent has 
stepped back enough to dilute the power of the kick, you fi nd yourself, aft er lowering the kicking leg, facing him in the 
same stance, but with the other side forward (Figure 6.1.47). You immediately launch the same crescent kick attack, 
with the other leg, and to his other elbow (Figure 6.1.48). Rare are the fi ghters able to learn from their mistakes in the 
middle of a fi ght! Th is time, lower the leg while keeping the circular momentum (Figure 6.1.49), and start a spin-back 
hook kick to the head (Figure 6.1.50).
Figure 6.1.47 
Figure 6.1.48 
Figure 6.1.49 
Figure 6.1.50
The crescent kick is an effective guard-opening, joint-attacking technique. An effectively delivered technique can often be successfully repeated in the 
heat of a ﬁ ght.

Figure 6.1.44 
Figure 6.1.45 
Figure 6.1.46
Specific Training
Th is kick requires a lot of training in order to impart maximum power in all the kick’s variations. It is important to 
• 
train at several ranges, and with a wide and a narrow circular trajectory.
Always practice the traditional full power crescent kick as a part of your crescent kick training routines.
• 
Figures 6.1.51 through 6.1.53 show several possible drills: kicking over a partner’s extended arm at several heights 
• 
for height, speed and technique; kicking the heavy bag for power; kicking the speed ball over a chair for wide arc and 
precision; kicking a medicine-ball over a standing bag or held by partner for height, precision and power.

228   CHAPTER SIX
into the kick: kick the bag with a 270 degrees circular crescent 
kick, from a side position with the heavy bag on your outside. 
Th is is also a drill for kicking from all positions.
Self-defense
Here again, because of the versatility of the kick, we present two 
applications of the crescent kick. Th e images that follow illustrate 
the classic use of the crescent kick against the knife-wielding arm 
of an assailant. Th is is not an easy move to succeed with—always 
remember that handling an armed opponent is extremely 
dangerous! Taking the initiative and being aggressive does 
give you an important element of surprise, however. You attack the wrist or elbow of the knife hand with a full power 
crescent kick, using the side of the shoe for maximum damage (Figure 6.1.57). Th e full power of the kick will take you 
into a spin-back that is critical to develop as far as possible from the opponent. Lower the leg close to you 
(Figure 6.1.58), and not close to the assailant! You then deliver a spin-back bent-body side kick (Chapter 2, Section 5, 
and Chapter 2, Section 9), with the other leg, to his forward knee (Figure 6.1.59). Keep the body away and kick through 
the knee to infl ict real damage (Figure 6.1.60). Lower the leg and continue the circular momentum to deliver a full 
power low kick (low straight-leg roundhouse, Chapter 3, Section 7) to the side of the same knee (Figure 6.1.61).
Figure 6.1.54 shows a drill for speed and distance management: 
• 
touch the heavy bag with the extended front hand and kick an 
imaginary, very close opponent with maximum speed, without 
touching the bag.
Figure 6.1.53
These illustrations show a variety of drills designed to improve a range of attributes. 
Figure 6.1.55 shows a drill for the feeling of maximum power

CRESCENT KICKS   229
Th e second application, illustrated in the following images, shows the use of the kick in very close combat. Th e use 
of high kicks at very close range is always a surprise. You duck your assailant’s jab with a small side-step/duck to the 
outside, while block-trapping the attacking hand for control (Figures 6.1.63 and 6.1.64). In an uninterrupted movement, 
you are already launching a high crescent kick to the side of his head (Figure 6.1.65). Th is is a short and fast move.
Figure 6.1.60 
Figure 6.1.61
Focus ﬁ rst on the attacker’s weapon hand with a classic crescent kick, and then deliver a spin-back bent body side kick to the attacker’s knee. 
Figure 6.1.62 
Figure 6.1.63 
Figure 6.1.64 
Figure 6.1.65
This quick move contains the element of surprise, as a high kick is not expected in close quarters ﬁ ghting. 
6.2 The Front Leg Crescent Kick
General
Th e front leg crescent kick is a very fast and useful kick, but it is much less powerful than the traditional rear leg 
crescent kick. It is easy to understand, as the arc is much narrower and there is no room for a lot of hip pivot. It is, 
however, a very effi  cient kick for starting a combination attack, to feint and harass, or to wear down an opponent’s 
guard. Th e kick, because of its lack of power, is only eff ective as a block, a guard mover or a head kick. It scores easily, 
but is generally not enough in itself.
Description
Th e traditional way to practice the front leg crescent kick is as follows. Bring your rear foot forward in a small step that 
brings it to the front foot level or a little bit further forward (Figure 6.2.2). Immediately launch the formerly front leg 
in a straight arc toward the head level of an imaginary opponent in front of you (Figure 6.2.3). Kick through and start 
bending and lowering the leg (Figure 6.2.4). Of course, like all front leg kicks, the kick can be delivered with a hop 
instead of a step, with the rear foot replacing the raising front foot. Like the regular crescent kick, the wideness of the arc 
can be varied according to the circumstances, but much less as the hips are already in position from the beginning.
Figure 6.1.56 
Figure 6.1.57 
Figure 6.1.58 
Figure 6.1.59

230   CHAPTER SIX
Key Points
Do not telegraph your step/hop forward. Especially keep head level steady, and “explode” forward with no warning.
• 
As the kick lacks in power, it is extremely important to kick through the target.
• 
Although the range is limited, do use the hips in the kick as much as possible.
• 
You are close to the opponent—keep your guard up.
• 
Always follow-up—this is generally not a single kick move.
• 
Targets
Th e only worthwhile targets are the head and groin, as well as the upper limb joints (for harassment).
Typical Application
Th e following illustrations show a very typical use of the kick. In opposite stances, feint a reverse punch while hopping 
forward, in order to draw your opponent’s attention to his lower inside and to give your own hips some pivoting room. 
Hit his guard from the outside with your front leg crescent kick (Figure 6.2.9). Lower your kicking leg forcefully in a 
rebounding motion: the foot hits the fl oor as if it was a spring and lift s right back (Figure 6.2.10). Your hips pivot back 
while your leg lift s in an outside crescent kick (Section 3 of this chapter) to the side of his face (Figure 6.2.11). If necessary, 
hop forward while kicking to close the distance. Hit through the target and lower your leg to his outside. Note that you 
are covered even if he tries to jab you. Simultaneously with your lowering the leg, keep the momentum and deliver a 
power reverse punch to his face with full hip pivot (Figure 6.2.12). You then sweep his front leg, in the direction of his 
toes (De ashi barai—judo), while controlling his lead arm and use it to pull him down (Figure 6.2.13). While he’s falling, 
lift  your other leg for a stomp kick, or a downward heel kick (Section 5 of this chapter). See Figure 6.2.14.

Figure 6.2.12 
Figure 6.2.13 
Figure 6.2.14
Pairing two opposing front leg crescent kicks in series is a typical (and effective) application of this kick. 
Specific Training
Th e kick must be practiced for speed on the heavy bag, while starting from diff erent ranges.
• 
Flexibility is key for speed in this kick: work on the front splits and back stretch for example.
• 
As the kick is not stand-alone, practice combinations (see Figures 6.2.8 through 6.2.14) in shadow boxing, with a 
• 
partner and on the bag.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations show a very effi  cient and surprising use of the kick at very close range and a very painful 
follow-up. As an assailant gets a hold of your hand (with his same hand), always react immediately, as he is probably 
following up with something nastier and has limited your ability to react (Figure 6.2.15). Rotate your hand clockwise 
up around his wrist in the classic hold reversal, while moving slightly to his outside (Figure 6.2.16). Immediately launch 
a crescent kick to the (blind) side of his head, while keeping hold of his wrist (Figure 6.2.17). Lower your leg forcefully 
over his extended arm while pulling his wrist. “Sit” (horse stance) on his extended arm while using his wrist to place his 
elbow joint up. Pull up on the wrist while sitting down on the elbow to control him or dislocate the joint (Figure 6.2.18). 
You can then upward hook back kick him in the face (Chapter 4, Section 7). See Figure 6.2.19. 
Figure 6.2.15

Figure 6.2.18 
Figure 6.2.19
Turn the tables on a wrist-grabbing opponent with a hold reversal and immediately launch a front leg crescent kick to his head, continuing down with 
your leg to trap and control his arm. Finish up with an upward hook back kick to his face.
6.3 The Outside Crescent Kick
Gyacku mikazuki geri / Sokuto mikazuki geri / Ura mikazuki geri / Uchi mikazuki geri (karate), Biteulo / Mandal cha gi 
(taekwondo), Queixada (capoeira), Th uong tao phong (viet vo dao), Pan toi (kung fu)
General
Th e outside crescent kick just travels the inverse trajectory of the crescent kick and strikes the target in front of you 
from your inside to your outside. In its “short and fast” version, it is more powerful than the fast crescent kick because 
of the hip movement always necessary to perform the kick. It is also a surprising kick, as it comes from outside your 
opponent’s vision fi eld if delivered from close enough, and comes in an “unnatural” direction. Just like for the crescent 
kick, the outside crescent can be delivered with a wide or a narrow arc, and all variations in between. Th e kick connects 
with the blade and/or the upper part of the foot. Just like with the crescent kick, the outside crescent can also be used to 
block, to harass or remove a guard or to attack the limbs; it is used from afar or in close combat.

These images show an outside crescent kick used against an opponent’s guard.
Description
Th e following illustrations show the kick in its traditional way: You bring your rear leg forward just like for an oblique 
front kick (Chapter 1 Section 12), knee chambered high, but with the leg and hips turned to your inside (Figure 6.3.2). 
You already pivot on your foot while extending the kicking leg to your inside (Figure 6.3.3). You then pivot back with 
your hips while completing the extension of the leg and kicking from your inside outwards (Figure 6.3.4). Th e full 
extension of the leg and the apex of your circular movement should coincide with impact, just as the leg passes in front 
of you. You kick through the target and then start to bend and lower the leg (Figure 6.3.5).

 
CRESCENT KICKS   233
Figures 6.3.16 through 6.3.18 show the use of the kick as an attack to the head from a close distance.
Figure 6.3.16 
Figure 6.3.17 
Figure 6.3.18
These images show a close-range outside crescent kick used to attack an opponent’s head.
Key Points
Th e leg is an extension of the hips: the circular movement comes from the hips.
• 
Keep your guard up as it is a kick that brings you closer to your opponent than most kicks.
• 
Always kick through the target.
• 
You need to pivot on your standing foot to allow for the hip movement.
• 
Practice the wide and the narrow arc versions.
• 
Targets
Typical targets include the limbs, the face and the groin. With a wide arc, the upper and lower back are also targets.
Typical Application
Th e following illustrations show a perfect set-up for this kick, which brings it as it should: from up close and from an 
unexpected direction. Get close to the opponent with a classic jab/cross combination (Kizami tsuki / Gyacku tsuki—
karate) to the face (Figures 6.3.20 and 6.3.21). Your high reverse punch (cross) is delivered purposely to the outside of 
his head to cause him to overblock, and your fi st lingers more than necessary to block his fi eld of vision while keeping 
his attention to his outside (Figure 6.3.22). Th is reverse punch (Gyacku tsuki—karate) also frees your hips and rear leg 
for an outside crescent kick to the inside of his head (Figure 6.3.23).

Figure 6.3.22 
Figure 6.3.23
This outside crescent kick application is launched from close quarters and will be an unpleasant surprise for the opponent who has been misdirected 
by your initial jab/cross combination. 
Specific Training
All training tips for the crescent kicks are valid, just performed in the opposite direction. Figure 6.3.24 shows the 
• 
kicking over a partner’s hand drill, the heavy bag kicking over a chair drill, and medicine ball kicking drill.

234   CHAPTER SIX
Always practice the narrow and wide arc variations.
• 
Figures 6.3.25 through 6.3.28 show a fi ghter practicing the kick on striking pads held by a moving partner.
•

Have a partner hold striking pads so that you can practice the kick at full strength to develop power and speed.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations show a limb attack to open an assailant’s guard and weaken his hold on a weapon. Th e side of 
a shoe is usually hard and can cause pain and damage. As mentioned, the kick is surprising as your rear leg, situated on 
his outside, suddenly attacks his lead hand from his inside, the opposite direction it should come from (Figure 6.3.30). 
Make use of the momentum to lower your leg while freeing your weight from your other leg and keep the general 
circular direction with a rear leg roundhouse (Chapter 3, Sections 1 and 2) to his groin (Figure 6.3.31). Lower the 
kicking leg to his inside, while controlling his armed elbow from the outside and punching him in his open kidneys or 
lower ribs (Figure 6.3.32). Keep pivoting while launching a crescent kick (Section 1 of this chapter) if he stays erect or a 
downward heel kick (Section 5 of this chapter) if he bends down (Figure 6.3.33).

6.4 The Front Leg Outside Crescent Kick
General
Th e front leg version of the outside crescent kick is very fast and generally unexpected, but of course lacks in power. 
However, this is a great kick for feinting, harassing and opening the guard, and as a fi rst kick in a combination. 
All what was said about the front leg crescent kick is true here as well.
Like all front leg kicks, the outside crescent kick can be delivered aft er diff erent footwork patterns. As a direct front 
leg kick from the fi ghting stance, it is not very eff ective.
Description
Figures 6.4.1 through 6.4.5 show the kick delivered aft er half-a-step: the rear foot comes forward at the front foot level, 
and then the front leg goes up into the kick.

These illustrations depict a front view of a front leg outside crescent kick. 
Figures 6.4.6 through 6.4.9 show the classical forward hop in which the rear foot comes to replace the already lift ing 
front foot. Fast, but make sure you do not jump up!

Figures 6.4.10 through 6.4.12 show the cross step which is slower, but allows for a more powerful kick with the hips 
pivot and a wider arc. You step with the rear foot behind the front foot!

236   CHAPTER SIX
Figures 6.4.13 through 6.4.17 show the use of the kick in its narrow arc version to open the guard of an opposite stance 
opponent, and then using the distraction and the momentum of the kick to deliver a ridgehand strike (Haito uchi—
karate) to the neck.

Figure 6.4.17
These images show a front leg outside crescent kick used to open the guard of an opposite stance opponent.
Figure 6.4.13 
Figure 6.4.14 
Figure 6.4.15
Key Points
All key points are similar to those of the front leg crescent kick (see Section 2 of this chapter) and those of the regular 
outside crescent kick (see Section 3 of this chapter).
Remember that when stepping/hopping forward, it is imperative not to telegraph your move by changing your head 
height or moving any part of your upper body.
Targets
Primary targets are the head or groin. Th e limbs may be targeted for harassment and guard opening purposes.
Typical Application
Th e following images show a great combination using the front leg outside crescent kick as a feint and guard opener. 
From an opposite stance to your opponent you surge forward with a hopping front leg outside crescent kick to the inside 
of his front arm (Figure 6.4.19). Always kick hard, as a kick and not as a sweep! Th is should hurt. As you lower the leg, 
you jab to the now guard-less face (Figure 6.4.20), and immediately re-launch an identical front leg outside crescent kick 
to the face or guard of the retreating opponent (Figure 6.4.21). Th is time, make use of the arc of the circular kick to turn 
the kick into a front leg sweep, ideally without lowering to the fl oor: You simply continue the arc downward and sweep 
the front leg of your hurt and/or retreating opponent (Figure 6.4.22). Th is maneuver (De ashi barai—judo) is usually 
easy to perform, as the opponent is leaning backward from your assault and does not have his weight on the front leg. 
Your sweep has, at least, lift ed his front leg while setting him off -balance. Lower your sweeping foot and jab him again 
(Kizami tsuki—karate) and immediately reverse punch him (Gyacku tsuki—karate) in the face (Figure 6.4.23). Grip him 

 
CRESCENT KICKS   237
with your punching hand, and go forward with your rear leg to execute a full sweep of the leg he is still standing on 
(O soto gari—judo). See Figure 6.4.25. As he falls down, hard, use the same leg for a downward heel kick (see Section 5 
of this chapter). 
Figure 6.4.22 
Figure 6.4.23 
Figure 6.4.24 
Figure 6.4.25
Open your opponent’s guard with a front leg outside crescent kick, and follow up with a jab to the unguarded face. Fire off another front leg outside 
crescent kick to the face or guard before transitioning to an off-balancing sweep. Place another jab and punch before taking him down with a second 
sweep. Optionally ﬁ nish the confrontation with a downward heel kick. 
Figure 6.4.18 
Figure 6.4.19 
Figure 6.4.20 
Figure 6.4.21
Specific Training
All drills of the front leg crescent kick and of the rear leg outside crescent kick are relevant here. Remember that the kick 
is a speed kick: you have to work on fl exibility, footwork and speed.
Practice on the heavy bag for speed and lack of telegraphing (burst out!), from diff erent ranges, marked on the fl oor.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations show a self-defense application of the principles that the kick is fast, can be used surprisingly 
at close range, and should be the fi rst of a combination. As your assailant steps in to punch you, hop forward in opposite 
stance (to his inside) and block instead of retreating as he expects (Figure 6.4.27). Your hop liberates the front leg for a 
close-range outside crescent kick to the head (Figure 6.4.28). Kick through and make use of the momentum to lower the 
leg behind you and continue the circular movement into a spin-back. As you lower the leg and continue to pivot, deliver 
a circular punch to the side of his face, basically a front hand hook delivered from the hips and with the whole body 
(Mawashi tsuki—karate). See Figure 6.4.29. Punch through, continue the spin-back into a bent-body (as you are close) 
spin-back hook kick to the head (Figure 6.4.30).

6.5 The Downward Heel Kick
Kakato otoshi geri (karate), Naeryeo chagi (taekwondo), Te kook (muay thai), Axe kick / Hatchet kick (common names), 
Ono geri (Ninjutsu)
General
Th e downward heel kick is a somewhat denigrated kick which does not receive the interest it deserves. It is basically a 
straight leg kick striking downwards from the apex of the highest leg lift  possible. It is of course the ideal kick to hit a 
bent, kneeling, falling or prone opponent, as the maximum power will be achieved aft er longest possible acceleration 
(See Figures 6.5.1 and 6.5.2). Th is kick is the most used fi nishing move aft er a sweep or takedown in karate competition. 
It was a very typical move of the great French champion of the 1970s, Dominique Valera. Th e kick is also useful though 
on a standing opponent, as it is very surprising and diffi  cult to deal with: standing fi ghters do not expect to be kicked 
from above, as a matter of routine. In that case, the kick is generally the fi rst kick of a combination, a harassing tactic, 
a feint, a guard opener or an attack to the joints and 
limbs. In order to execute the downward kicking move, 
the leg must be lift ed swift ly and straight (maximum 
power at maximum distance from the hips); Th is can be 
executed either as a crescent arc, an outside crescent arc, 
or a straight leg front lift . In general, the front lift  is not 
relevant, as the target to be hit is likely in the way of the 
raising leg. Needless to point out then, that the downward 
heel kick is the ideal kick coming aft er a crescent kick or 
an outside crescent kick.
Description
Th e following images show the delivery of the kick from a crescent lift  and from an outside crescent lift . You should hit 
with the back of the heel, and always kick through the target. Slow the acceleration of the downward momentum only 
aft er you have hit through the target. As mentioned, the kick at its maximum power, as a fi nishing or one-is-enough-
kick, will only be when delivered to a “lower” opponent: Figures 6.5.3 through 6.5.6 depict the kick on a kneeling or 
standing up opponent, and Figures 6.5.7 through 6.5.10 depict the kick on a falling/prone opponent.

CRESCENT KICKS   239
Figures 6.5.12 through 6.5.15 show a classical use of the kick on a bent-over opponent: In opposite stances, you attack 
with a rear leg roundhouse to the groin or solar plexus of your opponent, then switch legs to deliver an outside crescent 
downward heel kick to his exposed neck or back.
Figure 6.5.11
This is the part of the foot that makes contact 
during the execution of a downward heel kick.

These images show a classical use of the downward heel kick on a bent-over opponent.
Figures 6.5.16 through 6.5.22 show the other classic situation for the use of this kick: A prone opponent. In this 
combination, you avoid and defl ect an oncoming front kick, overextending your opponent to place him off -balance as he 
lands. You then sweep his landing leg to take him down. As he is still falling down, you already prepare your downward 
heel kick by lift ing the sweeping leg in an outside crescent as high as possible. It is imperative not to stop between the 
two moves and start the kick as soon as he starts falling.

240   CHAPTER SIX
Key Points
You can only lift  high and fast a leg with relaxed 
• 
muscles.
Kick through the target.
• 
Do not slow the leg descent before the kick has hit.
• 
Keep your guard up as you lower the leg, as the hit 
• 
itself can cause some off -balancing and put you in 
a vulnerable position.
Targets
Targets on a standing opponent include: the head 
• 
and face, the clavicle, the joints of the upper limbs: 
shoulders, elbows and wrists from all sides.
Targets on a bent opponent include: the head, neck, 
• 
upper and lower back.
Targets on a prone opponent encompass the whole 
• 
body from ankles to head.
Figure 6.5.23 
Figure 6.5.24 
Figure 6.5.25 
Figure 6.5.26
Avoid your opponent’s roundhouse and follow up with a downward heel kick.
Specific Training
Work on your fl exibility, especially splits and leg raises.
• 
Practice the straight leg upward kick (see Chapter 1, Section 3), as high as possible.
• 
Th is kick needs a lot of training to achieve speed, power and the right feeling of accelerating until having hit through. 
• 
Th e kick needs to be practiced with both leg lift s: 
inside crescent and outside crescent. It must be drilled 
to hit at all heights: head, back of bent opponent, 
and prone opponent.
Kick a medicine ball held by a partner at several 
• 
heights, a standing bag, a striking pad held by a partner 
at various heights (Figures 6.5.27 and 6.5.28), a lying 
bag, a speed-ball as the face of a standing opponent, 
and a used tire held by a partner. See Figures 6.5.29 
through 6.5.34.

Practice the downward heel kick on a striking pad held by a partner.
Figure 6.5.29 
Figure 6.5.30 
Figure 6.5.31 
Figure 6.5.32
Typical Application
As mentioned, on a standing opponent, the kick is not eff ective for a single attack. Th e following images show its use as 
a timed stop kick against a roundhouse, where it is good enough for infl icting serious damage and to knock down the 
opponent. From an opposite stance, avoid a full rear leg roundhouse of your opponent by twisting forward and on your 
outside, while keeping your hand up to control the kick (Figure 6.5.24). Lift  your “liberated” rear leg into an outside 
crescent lift  and strike downwards to the face or clavicle of your opponent (Figure 6.5.26).

 
CRESCENT KICKS   241
Figure 6.5.33 
Figure 6.5.34
These illustrations depict a variety of training aids that are available to help you practice your downward heel kick.
Self-defense
Here, we present two applications of the kick: one as a crescent lift  to hit and fi nish off  a bent opponent, and the other as 
an outside crescent lift  and the fi rst kick in an aggressive combination.
Th e following fi gures show the use of the kick to get out of a clinch. As your assailant grabs you in close combat 
and gets into a boxing clinch (Figure 6.5.35), get one hand on the back of his head to keep him bent down, while you 
control his hand by grabbing it at the elbow with your other hand (Figure 6.5.36). Push him away with both hands, 
while continuing to push his neck 
down and distancing your hips 
from him. Launch the leg of your 
“neck” hand into a crescent lift  
and keep your hand on his neck 
for as long as possible (Figure 
6.5.37). Strike down on his neck 
or back with a downward heel 
kick (Figure 6.5.38).
Figures 6.5.40 and 6.5.41 show the use of a hopping, front leg, outside crescent lift , downward heel kick to feint 
or open the guard of an opponent in the same stance. As he retreats, lower your leg forward (Figure 6.5.42) and 
immediately launch a full power straight leg roundhouse (Chapter 3, Section 7) to both his legs at knee level 
(Figure 6.5.43). As he falls, downward heel kick him again in the body (Figure 6.5.45).

242   CHAPTER SIX
6.6 The Switch Downward Heel Kick
General
Nearly all kick types can be delivered as switch kicks; this is only a matter of preceding footwork: you jump while 
switching legs (rear to front and vice-versa) and immediately launch the relevant kick with the “new” rear leg. We present 
it here, because the downward heel kick is especially adapted, and usually successful, as a switch kick. Th e switch allows 
you to use the front leg to kick, with the power of a rear leg kick. It also baffl  es your opponent, usually as he comes 
toward you: you jump and move, but basically stay (more or less) in the same place.
Th e switch downward heel kick is most of the time a stop kick or counter-attack kick, as it is excellent for close combat.
Description
Figures 6.6.1 through 6.6.5 show the 
switch, the rebound of the kicking 
leg and the delivery of the kick, just 
as a regular downward heel, from a 
crescent or an outward crescent lift .
Figures 6.6.6 through 6.6.10 
show a great example of application 
of the kick: the switch serves to 
gather power, but also to avoid an attack to your front knee. As the assailant launches a front leg low kick (straight 
roundhouse) toward your inside knee, you jump/switch legs while moving slightly backward. Your formerly front leg 
rebounds off  the fl oor into a full powered outward crescent downward heel kick to your assailant’s head.

CRESCENT KICKS   243
Key Points
All key points mentioned for the regular downward heel 
kick apply: 
You can only lift  high and fast a leg with relaxed 
• 
muscles.
Kick through the target.
• 
Do not slow the leg descent before the kick has hit.
• 
Keep your guard up as you lower the leg, as the hit 
• 
itself can cause some off -balancing and put you into 
a vulnerable position.
In addition:
It is important to make the kicking foot rebound off  
• 
the fl oor at the end of the switching hop, as if hitting a 
spring: down, and immediately up at full speed.
Targets
As listed for the regular downward heel kick, the following 
targets apply:
Targets on a standing opponent include: the head 
• 
and face, the clavicle, the joints of the upper limbs: 
shoulders, elbows and wrists from all sides.
Targets on a bent opponent include: the head, neck, 
• 
upper and lower back.
Targets on a prone opponent encompass the whole 
• 
body from ankles to head.

Figure 6.6.17
A typical application of the switch downward heel kick.
Figure 6.6.12 
Figure 6.6.13 
Figure 6.6.14 
Figure 6.6.15
Specific Training
Train just like you would for the regular downward heel kick, but with the switch. Switch in place, and switch while 
purposely edging slightly forward or backward. Work on the speedball, striking pads, standing bags, and tires.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations depict the use of the kick as a counter to a spin-back kick, when starting in reverse stances. 
When attacked with a spin back kick, always move forward, never backward, as the centrifugal power is at its maximum 
at the foot end and is negated close to the assailant’s body. As your assailant attacks you with a spin-back hook kick from 
an opposite guard, do not retreat, but switch while edging slightly forward and to your inside, blocking or controlling 
the kick (Figure 6.6.19). Use your rear leg to deliver an outside crescent lift ed downward heel kick (Figure 6.6.21).
Typical Application
Figures 6.6.12 through 6.6.17 depict a great use of the kick against an opponent waiting for a move on your part to stop-
reverse punch you. You switch, slightly forward, while extending your lead hand in a convincing jab. Immediately launch 
your now rear leg on the outside of his incoming punch, with an outside crescent lift , and downward heel kick him.

6.7 The Outward Ghost Groin Kick
General
Th is is a fantastic kick this author fi rst saw in a Wing-Chun kung fu practice. Like all groin kicks, it is ideal for self-
defense. It is an easy kick to perform, very unexpected and suitable for close combat. You deliver the kick while turning 
away from the opponent, in place, and lift ing the foot directly from its position to the groin of the adversary.
Description
Th e move is easier to understand if you look at the 
illustrations to the right. You pivot inwards on your front 
foot, while lift ing the slightly bent rear leg directly to the 
target, with no other movement of the upper body 
(see Figure 6.7.2). Th e upper and lower portions of your 
body must be disconnected with no hint that you are doing 
anything other than pivoting. Use your momentum and leg 
muscles to put power into the kick and strike with the edge 
(blade) of the foot (Figure 6.7.3).
Figures 6.7.4 through 6.7.6 show the use of the kick in a simultaneous forward evasion of a straight jab. In self-defense, 
you would hit the groin and not the abdomen. 
Figure 6.7.4 
Figure 6.7.5 
Figure 6.7.6
In close quarters, evade a jab while kicking. 
Key Points
For success, it is imperative not to telegraph: Keep your upper body relaxed.
• 
You need to work on the fl exibility of the knee.
• 
Th e muscles of the striking leg are relaxed also: it is the speed that brings power to the kick.
• 
You are in close quarters: Keep your guard up.
•

CRESCENT KICKS   245
Targets
Th e targets are the groin and the face of a bent opponent, exclusively.
Typical Application
Th e following illustrations depict a typical application of the kick. You use it when a combination has brought you close 
to your opponent. You can also kick him and take back your distance with no danger. Attack your opponent with a high 
reverse punch/front leg front kick to the opened midsection (Figures 6.6.8 and 6.6.9). Your opponent steps back and you 
reverse punch him to the face while lowering your kicking leg, whether you have hit him or not (Figure 6.6.10). You fi nd 
yourself close to your opponent, in opposite stance, and with the rear leg free of weight. Deliver the outward ghost groin 
kick while keeping your guard up! See Figure 6.6.11.
Figure 6.7.11
A typical application of the outward ghost groin kick.
Figure 6.7.7 
Figure 6.7.8 
Figure 6.7.9 
Figure 6.7.10
Specific Training
Th e kick is easy to perform, but 
• 
requires drilling to get the “feel” 
of it, to learn to gauge the distance 
and to use it naturally.
Practice on the heavy bag with 
• 
its bottom at groin height, from 
various ranges. Concentrate on 
relaxed upper body and kicking leg, 
and give no telegraphing moves.
Work on the knee joint fl exibility: 
• 
runner stretches, lotus and hero’s 
poses.
Figures 6.7.12 and 6.7.13 show the 
• 
drilling of the kick with a moving partner holding a striking pad.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations depict the use of the kick as a fast, immediate response to a wrist grab. When grabbed, always 
react immediately: the grab puts you in a vulnerable position and with your attention away from your assailant’s next 
move. Your assailant has gotten a hold of your right wrist from the outside, with his right hand, in order to pull you into 
Figure 6.7.12  
 
 
                 Figure 6.7.13

246   CHAPTER SIX
a left  punch (Figure 6.7.14). Pivot away from the punch while delivering the outward ghost groin kick (Figure 6.7.15). 
As soon as he is hit, circle his wrist to get a hold of it, and pull while you pivot back and punch him in the face 
(Figure 6.7.16). Use your other leg to stomp the back of his knee, while keeping a hold and twisting his wrist 
(Figure 6.7.17). You can now hit his exposed elbow joint, or armlock him.

If your wrist has been grabbed from the outside and your opponent begins to pull you into a punch, pivot away 
from the punch and deliver an outward ghost groin kick. 
6.8 The Spin-back Outside Crescent Kick
Armada (capoeira)
General
We gave this kick its capoeira name as it is a very visible and much used kick in their “game.” But the kick is also 
omnipresent in taekwondo contests and other contact sports. We complained earlier about the lack of power of the 
regular outside crescent kick (Section 3 of this chapter)—what better way to remedy that than a spin-back? Th e spin-
back allows for plenty of acceleration before hitting the target. It is therefore a very powerful kick, with the drawbacks 
of the spin-back kicks: more time and distance to travel, and some loss of eye contact when spinning back.
Description
Th e following illustrations show the delivery of the kick. As for all spin-backs, the head turns fi rst, pulling the shoulders 
and then the hips (Figure 6.8.2). Th e hips then pull the kicking leg with all the stored energy of the twist (Figure 6.8.3). 
Accelerate until you have kicked through the target, and lower the leg (Figure 6.7.6).

CRESCENT KICKS   247
Key Points
Kick through the target, do not decelerate before you hit.
• 
Minimize the no-eye contact period, and keep your guard up.
• 
You must totally commit to the kick to succeed.
• 
Targets
Th is is a powerful kick: Most targets are valid, although head and groin are preferred. Th e upper and lower back, as well 
as the solar plexus are great targets to infl ict paralyzing pain to the opponent. Th e kick trajectory does not make it a 
good kick to attack the legs (A spin-back hook kick—see Chapter 5, Section 4—would be preferable).
Typical Application
Th e following illustrations show the classical and natural combination for the use of this kick: In opposite stance, rear 
leg-crescent kick (Section 1 of this chapter) your opponent’s lead arm elbow, opening his guard and pushing it to the 
outside (Figures 6.8.20 and 6.8.21). You have kicked through, infl icting pain, and kept the circular momentum. As soon 
as you lower your leg in front, keep pivoting to deliver a spin-back outside crescent kick to his unguarded head with the 
other leg (Figure 6.8.23).
Figures 6.8.11 through 6.8.14 show the delivery of the kick as a counterattack to a full step punch (Oie tsuki—karate).

Specific Training
Train for speed, precision and distance—
• 
not for power.
Flexibility training is required.
• 
Kick the speed-bag over a chair 
• 
(See Figure 6.8.24).
Kick the heavy bag from diff erent ranges 
• 
(See Figure 6.8.25).
Drill with a moving partner, protected 
• 
by a striking pad.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations depict the use of the kick against a front kick attack. On top of the power of the accelerating 
spin-back, the successful combination gives you the added bonus of having the assailant impaling himself on your 
incoming kick. You are attacked, in opposite stance, with a fully committed penetrating front kick, which you avoid by 
evading forward and to the outside of the kick. Block or control the kicking leg while starting the spin-back 
(Figure 6.8.27). If you have caught the kicking leg, pull it slightly forward to accentuate the loss of balance of your 
attacker. Deliver your spin-back outside crescent kick to his head, as he lowers (falls forward) his kicking leg 
(Figure 6.8.29). Kick through the target, keeping your circular momentum, and lower your leg at your rear, presenting 
your side toward the assailant (Figure 6.8.30). Adjust distance if necessary, and use the other leg (front) to sweep his 
front leg, while grabbing his shoulder and pulling him down (O soto gari—judo). See Figure 6.8.31. Downward heel kick 
(Section 5 of this chapter) him once he is on the ground.

6.9 The Spin-back Downward Heel Kick
General
Th e spin back downward heel kick is adding to the power of the leg muscles and the power of gravity, the power of the 
centrifugal acceleration of the spin-back pivot. It is, therefore, a very powerful kick, but hard to control. Because of the 
spin-back, the kick is not really a pure downward heel kick, but more of a hybrid downward heel/outside crescent kick. 
Th e momentum of the spin-back, combined with the downward kick, results in a diagonal downward kick, ideal to 
strike the side of the face and neck, and the clavicle, with extreme force. Th e kick is, of course, ideal for close combat.
Description
Figures 6.9.1 through 6.9.4 show the delivery: Just 
like a spin-back outside crescent kick (Section 8 of 
this chapter), this kick reaches as high as possible, 
and with the apex just before completing the spin-
back. Th e downward movement starts before you 
have completed the 180 degrees pivot. Keep both the 
pivoting momentum and the downward move at full 
speed until you have hit through the target.
Figures 6.9.5 through 6.9.9 show the use of the kick as a natural follow-up to a leg block: You block a low kick with 
a circular raised knee block and make use of the momentum to spin back. As your opponent lowers his body to recoil 
away from the coming spin-back kick, your outside crescent kick becomes a downward heel kick.

250   CHAPTER SIX
Key Points
Control the lift  of the leg during spin back, to make 
• 
sure the apex of the lift  is before you have completed 
the spin-back—you must allow for some more pivot 
while the leg is going down.
Keep your guard up: you are close to your opponent.
• 
Kick through the target and do not decelerate before.
• 
Targets
Targets include: the side of the face, the side and back of 
the neck, the clavicle, the back, if the opponent is bent 
down, and the upper limbs.
Specific Training
Because of the angle of the kick, it is diffi  cult to train on bags and balls. Try a standing bag that has a top that’s at 
• 
shoulder-level.
Th e best drill is kicking a standing, and then moving trained opponent, who holds a good striking pad (Figure 6.9.15). 
• 
Th e kicker must still be very careful, as the kick is devastating.

Step to the inside as your opponent attempts a jab. Deliver the spin-back downward heel kick to the side of his neck. 
Figure 6.9.15
Have a partner hold a striking pad to help you 
develop skill in the spin-back downward heel kick.
Th is is a great kick, but it must be practiced a lot. Train at full speed, and train oft en.
• 
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations show the use of the kick in a close combat situation, aft er a great and very eff ective opening. 
Your assailant is an aggressive puncher and you surprise him by evading him downward, very low, and forward, toward 
him, with a reverse circular elbow strike (Gyacku ushi mawashi Empi uchi—karate) to the groin (Figure 6.9.17). 
Stand up, fully guarded, on his outside, while he bends from the pain, and start your spinning pivot with a hook to the 
head (Figure 6.9.19). Keep the circular momentum in your full spin-back downward heel kick and hit him in the back 
or the back of the neck according to his position and level of bending (Figure 6.9.22). Aft er lowering the kicking leg, 
you can keep the momentum and deliver, with the other leg, a straight leg roundhouse (Section 7 of this chapter) to his 
thigh or back of the knee (Figure 6.9.23).
Typical Application
Th e following illustrations show a typical application in close combat. As your opponent jabs you with commitment, 
you do not retreat but slip forward to his inside while initiating your spinning (Figures 6.9.11 and 6.9.12). Keep your 
hands up for protection and deliver the kick to the side of his neck (Figure 6.9.14). You could also hit him with a 
hammerfi st strike as you spin back and before delivering the kick.

6.10 The 360 Spin Crescent Kick
General
For those who complain about the lack of power of the crescent kick, here comes the solution: a crescent kick delivered 
aft er a full circle of acceleration. Th e kick, of course takes longer to hit the target, but it is so strong that it is diffi  cult to 
block. Although it is much telegraphed, it is still surprising because it is rarely used, and somewhat counter-intuitive: 
You kick with your front leg, but still do a full 360 degree circle before hitting the target! Th e kick can be delivered as an 
off ensive kick where you step forward toward your opponent and as a defensive/counterattack kick with footwork taking 
you away from your opponent.
Description
Th e following illustrations show the kick in both applications (off ensive, and defensive/counterattack), with the fi rst 
stage being identical: you pivot on your rear leg in a classical spin-back motion.
In the defensive kick, keep pivoting while taking a full step away with your front leg. Continue pivoting, and with the 
same leg (which is now the rear leg), deliver a regular crescent kick, using the full power of the uninterrupted pivot. 
See Figures 6.10.1 through 6.10.4.

mode (top) and a diagram of the associated footwork (bottom).
In the off ensive kick (Figures 6.10.6 through 6.10.9), you bring your rear leg forward toward your opponent in the 
same circular spinning movement, and keep pivoting on this now front foot. You keep the momentum while delivering a 
full crescent kick with the (now) rear leg.

the spin-back step.

Figure 6.10.16
An example of the 360 spin crescent kick used as part of an attack combination.
Key Points
Th e kick is one smooth, uninterrupted spin—no stopping.
• 
Keep your guard up and minimize the loss of eye contact while spinning back.
• 
Use the wide arc version of the crescent kick for maximum power.
• 
Th e spin-back is head fi rst, then shoulders, then hips.
• 
Kick through the target, and do not decelerate before impact.
• 
Targets
Th e kick is very powerful and everything goes: from the thigh to the head, including the arms.
Typical Application
Th e kick being very much “telegraphed,” it is not really suitable as an off ensive opening move. Th e following illustrations 
show its use in an off ensive combination, making use of the circular movement. You feint a low reverse punch 
(Figure 6.10.18), in order to start your lunging combination of a high jab (Figure 6.10.19) to high spin-back backfi st. 
While spinning back with the backfi st punch (Figure 6.10.21), bring your rear leg forward and keep the circular/forward 
momentum, which will pull your (now) rear leg into a full crescent kick to his face (Figure 6.10.22). If your backfi st 
has contacted his lead hand attempting to block, try to grab and control it while completing the kick. Kick “through” 
the head and lower the leg, while keeping the circular momentum alive. Keep pivoting and deliver a spin-back outside 
crescent kick (Section 8 of this chapter) with the other leg (Figure 6.10.25).

254   CHAPTER SIX
Specific Training
Th is kick must be drilled for power: full power on the heavy bag!
• 
Th e power comes from speed and acceleration: Drill for speed on the speedball.
• 
Th is kick needs a lot of range training: Practice both forms (off ensive and defensive) on the heavy bag from various 
• 
distances, marked on the fl oor.
Self-defense
Th e following illustrations depict, purposely, an application of the kick in a form that is neither off ensive nor defensive. 
As already mentioned many times, the number of possible nuances for any kick is infi nite. Th is shows the use of the 
kick, in place, aft er the opponent has been stunned and is not moving. As your assailant starts his front leg side kick 
attack, jam his lift ing leg with a hopping front-leg side stop-kick (Figure 6.10.27). Without lowering the leg, deliver a 
hopping high roundhouse to his face (Figure 6.10.28). Lower the kicking leg close to your rear leg, while starting your 
spin-back pivot, and use the same leg again for your 360 spin-back crescent kick (Figure 6.10.31). Kick through the target 
and lower the kicking leg behind his front leg. As a follow up, you can grab his shoulder while sweeping his leg with an 
inside reap (Uchi mata—judo). See Figure 6.10.33.

Interrupt your opponent’s side kick with a stop-kick, then immediately deliver a high roundhouse to his face. Follow up with a 360 spin-back crescent 
kick, and then sweep him to the ﬂ oor.

More Advanced Crescent Kicks
What follows is a brief review of some more advanced crescent kicks. Th ey are not presented in detail here, as they are 
beyond the scope of this book.
The Flying Crescent Kick
Mikazuki tobi geri (karate)
Th e fl ying version of the crescent kick is not very commonly used, as the kick does not lend itself especially well to the 
jumping version. Th e jumping does not add anything to the momentum of the kick. It is good to practice though, 
as jumping forward, instead of up, can be of help to adjust the range of the crescent kick. 

 
CRESCENT KICKS   255
The Flying Outside Crescent Kick
Gyacku mikazuki tobi geri (karate)
Th e fl ying version of the outside crescent kick is much more 
common, but basically with a narrow arc. Th e jumping does not add 
a lot to the circular momentum of the kick itself, and the kick used 
is usually a narrow arc kick, close to a hybrid front kick/outside 
crescent. It is, though, coming at a surprising angle and is quite 
effi  cient: Th e jumping adds some power to the normally weak kick. 
The Spin-back Flying Crescent Kick 
Th e spin back fl ying crescent kick is a very powerful version of the 
crescent kick, as the liberation of the constraints of the fl oor allow 
for a fast spin, and therefore acceleration. It is basically a front leg 
kick, following a full 360 spin. Like all fl ying kicks, it can be delivered 
jumping forward, backward or in place, according to the relative 
position of the opponent. It can be performed jumping high or low 
and far. Th e spin-back fl ying crescent kick is more of a defensive/counterattack kick.
The Spin-back Outside Crescent Flying Kick
Th e fl ying version of the spin-back outside crescent kick is pretty straightforward. It is a very fast and powerful kick, 
used a lot in high kicking styles like taekwondo. It is more suitable to defensive and timing moves, or combinations, as it 
is a “short” kick. Th e jumping allows for closing the distance, however. 
The Spin-back Flying Downward Heel Kick
Th e fl ying version of the spin-back downward heel kick is even more powerful, as the spinning back is free from the 
constraints of standing on the ground, and therefore faster. Th is is a great “timing” stop kick in close combat, but, like all 
fl ying kicks, can be performed jumping off ensively forward or defensively backward. Th e angled trajectory is even more 
pronounced than in the regular spin-back downward heel kick, as the spinning momentum cannot be slowed before 
landing back on the ground: It should really be an “oblique angled downward” kick. 
The 360 Spin-back Flying Downward Heel Kick
Th is is already a much more complex kick, quite acrobatic, and not for everyone. However, it is a great kick, and we have 
seen it performed successfully in Korean styles, rich in high and fl ying kicks. It basically is a spin-back downward heel 
kick delivered with the front leg. It is identical to the regular spin-back fl ying downward heel kick, but is preceded by 
a switch of the legs, in the air, at the outset of the jump. Th e switch can be forward or backward, but the kick is better 
suited as a defensive stop-kick. 
The Double Spin-back Outward Crescent Kick
Th is is, very simply, two spin-back outward crescent kicks delivered in a row, one aft er the other, with the same leg, and 
making use of the uninterrupted circular momentum. Th is is a very eff ective combination, whether the fi rst kick has 
scored or missed: You hit the already stunned opponent, or the counterattacking one. It is also a great drill for learning 
to kick from all positions and to understand the “feel” of the importance of acceleration in circular kicks.
The Spin-back Hook Feint to Downward Heel Kick
Th is kick is basically a hybrid kick between the spin-back hook kick (Chapter 5, Section 4) and the spin-back downward 
heel kick (Section 9 of this chapter). Th e spin back hook kick is purposely emphasized, in order to squeeze a block from 
the opponent, but at the last possible instant, the hips rotate to allow for an unexpected climbing surge of the foot, and a 
downward kick. Well executed, the feint is extremely compelling, and the kick is extremely surprising.
