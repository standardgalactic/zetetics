1.1  Introduction
­
1.1
Source  The source station can be a computer or server, and its function is to pass 
information to a transmitter for subsequent transmission.
Transmitter  The function of a transmitter is to accept information from the source 
and change the information such that it is compatible with the transmission link. 
Information is then transmitted over the communication link. Modems and network 
cards are examples of transmitters.
Transmission Link  The function of a transmission link is to carry information 
from a transmitter to a receiver. The transmission link can be a conductor, fiber optic 
cable, or wireless media (air).

Receiver  The receiver accepts information from the transmission link. The infor­
mation is then converted to proper form so that it is acceptable to the destination.
Destination  The receiver passes information to the destination for processing.
In networking technology, both the receiver and transmitter come in one unit and 
are usually installed inside the computer, such as network cards or modems.
1.2  Computer Networks
Networking is a business tool for companies. For example, a bank can transfer funds 
between branches by using a network, people can access their bank accounts using 
automatic teller machines via a network, and travel agencies use networks to make 
airline reservations. Everyday online activities such as shopping and banking trans­
actions are also possible because of computer networks. Students can now access 
the Internet in any location on their campus from their laptop computers or smart­
phone, thanks to the rapid growth of networking technology.
Networking is a generic term. Several computers connected to each other are 
called a computer network. A network is a system of computers and related equip­
ment connected by communication links to share data. The related equipment may 
be printers, fax machines, modems, copiers, and so forth. The following are some of 
the benefits of using computer networks:
Resource Sharing: Computers in a network can share resources such as data, print­
ers, disk drives, and scanners.
Reliability: Since computers in a network can share data, if one of the computers on 
the network crashes, a copy of its resources might be found on other computers 
in the network.
Cost: Microcomputers are much less expensive than mainframes. Instead of using 
several mainframes, a network can use one mainframe as a server, with several 
microcomputers connected to the server as clients. This creates a client/server 
relationship.
Communication: Users can exchange messages via electronic mail or other messag­
ing systems, or they can transfer files.

1.3  Network Models
A computer in a network can be either a server, client, or a peer. A server is a com­
puter on the network that holds shared files and the network operating system that 
manages the network operation. For a client computer to access the resources in the 
server, the client computer must request information from the server. The server will 
then transmit the information requested to the client.
The following three models are used, based on the type of network opera­
tion needed:
	1.	 Peer-to-peer network (work group)
	2.	 Server-based network
	3.	 Client/server network
Peer-to-Peer Model (Work Group)
­
1.2
File Server Model
In a file server model, a server stores all the network’s shared files and applications 
such as word processor documents, compilers, database applications, and the net­
work operating system (NOS) that manages network operations. A user can access 
the file server and transfer shared files to his or her station.
1.3
Some of the most popular servers are as follows:
Mail server: A mail server stores all the clients’ mail. The client can access the 
server and transfer incoming mail to its station. The client can also use the mail 
server to transfer outgoing mail to the mail server of another network.
Print server: Clients can submit files to the server for printing.
 
1.3  Network Models

Communication server: The server is used by clients to communicate with other 
networks via communication links.
Client/Server Model
­
1.4
1.4  Network Components
A network is composed of the following basic components:
	1.	 Network Interface Card (NIC): Each computer in a network requires a 
Network Interface Card. The NIC allows the stations on the network to commu­
nicate with each other.
1  Introduction to Communications Networks

5
	2.	 Transmission Medium: The transmission medium connects the computers 
together and provides a communication link between the computers on the net­
work. Some of the more common types are twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, 
fiber optic cable, and wireless.
	3.	 Network Operating System (NOS): The NOS runs on the server and provides 
services to the client such as login, password, print file, network administration, 
and file sharing. Most modern computer operating systems have NOS 
functionality.
1.5  Network Topology
The topology of a network describes the way computers are connected. Topology is 
a major design consideration for cost and reliability. The following is a list of com­
mon topologies found in computer networking.
•	 Star
•	 Ring
•	 Bus
•	 Mesh
•	 Tree
•	 Hybrid
Star Topology
1.5
­
The disadvantage of the star topology is that the operation of the entire network 
depends on the hub. If the hub breaks down, the entire network is disabled. The 
advantages of star topology are as follows:
 
1.5  Network Topology

6
•	 It is easy to set up the network.
•	 It is easy to expand the network.
•	 If one link to the hub breaks, only the station using that link is affected.
It is possible for a network to have one topology electrically, or logically, but 
another topology physically. For example, Ethernet with unshielded twisted pair 
cabling uses the star topology physically, but the stations are connected logically 
using a bus topology.
Ring Topology
1.6
1.6
­
The disadvantages of ring topology are as follows:
•	 If a link or a station breaks down, the entire network is disabled.
•	 Complex hardware is required (the network interface card is expensive).
•	 Adding a new client disrupts the entire network.
The advantages of ring topology are as follows:
•	 It is easy to install.
•	 It is easy to expand.
 
1  Introduction to Communications Networks

7
Bus Topology
1.7
The advantages of bus topology are simplicity, low cost, and easy expansion of 
the network. The disadvantage of bus topology is that a breakdown in the bus cable 
brings the entire network down.
Mesh Topology
1.8
 
 
1.5  Network Topology

8
The advantage of a fully connected topology is that each station has a dedicated 
connection to every other station. Therefore, this topology offers the highest reli­
ability and security. If one link in the mesh topology breaks, the network 
remains active.
A major disadvantage of a fully connected topology is that it uses many connec­
tions and therefore requires a great deal of wiring, especially when the number of 
stations increases. Consider, for example, a fully connected network with 100 work­
stations. Workstation #1 would require 99 network connections to connect it to 
workstations 2 through 100. The total number of connections is determined by 
N(N-1)/2, where N is the number of stations in the network. This type of topology 
is seldom used because it is not cost-effective.
1.9
Tree Topology
­
1.10
The advantage of this topology is that when one hub breaks, only stations con­
nected to the broken hub will be affected. There are several types of hubs as 
listed below.
 
1  Introduction to Communications Networks

9
 
 
Manageable Hub: Intelligent hubs are defined as manageable hubs, which means 
each of the ports on the hub can be enabled or disabled by the network adminis­
trator through software.
Stand-Alone Hub: A stand-alone hub is a type of hub used for workgroups of com­
puters that are separate from the rest of the network. They cannot be linked 
together logically to represent a larger hub.
Modular Hub: A modular hub comes with a chassis or card cage and the number of 
ports can be extended by adding extra cards.
Stackable Hub: A stackable hub looks like a stand-alone hub, but several of them 
can be stacked or connected together in order to increase the number of ports.
Hybrid Topology
1.11
1.5  Network Topology

1.6  Types of Networks
The distance between computers that are connected as a network determines the 
type of network, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network 
(MAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN).
Local Area Network (LAN)
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a high-speed network designed to link computers 
and other data communication systems together within a small geographic area such 
as an office, department, or a single floor of a multi-story building. Several LANs 
can be connected together in a building or campus to extend the connectivity. A 
LAN is considered a private network. The most popular LANs in use today are 
Ethernet, Token Ring, and Gigabit Ethernet.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
1.12
Wide Area Networks (WANs)
A Wide Area Network (WAN) is used for long-distance transmission of informa­
tion. WANs cover a large geographical area, such as an entire country or continent. 
WANs may use leased lines from telephone companies, Public Switch Data 
Networks (PSDN), or satellites for communication links.

Wireless Network Technologies
Wireless network technologies can be categorized based on power consumption. 
These include the following:
	1.	 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), used for offices and buildings
	2.	 Low-Power Wireless Network technologies for Internet of Things (IoT)
	
(a)	 Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) Technologies with 
a coverage of up to 100 m such as ZigBee, 6LoPAN, Thread, and Z-Wave 
and Bluetooth
	
(b)	 Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) with coverage of kilometers, 
such as LoRa, Sigfox, and Dash
Internet Backbone and Internet Service Providers

1.6  Types of Networks

12
 
1.7  Communication Protocols and Standard Organizations
A communication protocol is a set of rules used by computers which allows them 
to communicate with each other. Computers must follow certain rules in order to 
communicate with each other. Some of the rules that define a protocol are as follows:
•	 Size of information. Both computers must agree on the minimum and maximum 
size of information.
•	 How to represent information. Information may be Unicode, ASCII, or encrypted.
•	 Error detection. The method used by the receiver to check the integrity of 
information.
•	 Receipt of information. The transmitter must know that information has been 
received at the destination.
•	 Non-receipt of information. Both computers must know what to do if informa­
tion sent is not received or if it is received but has been corrupted.
Some of the common network protocols are:
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol used in the Internet and 
many LANs.
NetBEUI: NetBIOS Extended User Interface is a small and fast protocol used for 
small LANs.
X.25: X.25 is a set of protocols used in packet switching networks.
IPX/SPX: Novell NetWare uses Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet 
Exchange.

NWlink: NWlink is a Microsoft version of IPX/SPX.
AppleTalk: AppleTalk developed by Apple for MAC.
1.7.1  Standard Organizations
There are several organizations that are constantly working toward developing stan­
dards for computers and communication equipment. The development of standards 
for computers enables hardware and software products made by different vendors to 
be compatible. Standardization allows products from different manufacturers to 
work together in creating customized systems. Without standards, only hardware 
and software made by the same manufacturer can work properly together. The fol­
lowing is a list of standards organizations:
IEEE  The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the largest 
technical organization in the world. The objective of IEEE is to advance the field of 
electronics, computer science, and computer engineering. The IEEE also develops 
standards for computers, electronics, and local area networks (in particular, the 
IEEE 802 standards).
ITU  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was founded in 1864 and 
became a United Nations Agency with the purpose of defining standards for tele­
communications, Wide Area Networks (WAN), Asynchronous Transfer Mode 
(ATM), and Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN).
EIA  The Electrical Industry Association (EIA) is a trade association representing 
high technology manufacturers in the United States. The EIA develops standards for 
connectors and transmission media. Some of the well-known EIA standards are 
RS-232 and RJ-45.
ANSI  The American National Standards Institute was founded in 1918. ANSI is 
composed of 1300 members representing computer companies, with the purpose of 
developing standards for the computer industry. ANSI is the US representative in 
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Some of the well-known 
ANSI standards include optical cabling, programming languages (ANSI C), and the 
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
ISO  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international 
organization that comprises national standards bodies of seventy-five countries. The 
ISO develops standards for a wide range of products, including the model for net­
works called the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model.
IETF   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) develops standards for the 
Internet, such as Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), HTTP, and DNS. The IETF is 
composed of international network designers, network industries, and researchers.
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  The World Wide Web Consortium develops 
standards for web technologies, such as HTML.
1.7  Communication Protocols and Standard Organizations

1.8  Networking Protocol Models
Two common protocol models, or suites, in use today are the 5-layer TCP/IP 
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model and the 7-layer OSI 
(Open Systems Interconnections) model.
 
1.15
Layer 1: Physical Layer
The Physical layer defines the type of signal and type of connectors (such as 
RS-232 or RJ-45) to be used for the Network Interface Card (NIC). It defines cable 
types (such as coaxial cable, twisted pair or fiber-optic cable) to be used for the 
transmission media. It accepts incoming signals from the media and converts those 
signals bits and converts outgoing data bits to signals for the transmission over media.
Layer 2: Data Link Layer
The Data Link layer defines the frame format, such as the start of a frame, end of 
a frame, size of a frame, and type of transmission. The Data Link layer performs the 
following functions:
	1.	 On the transmitting side: The Data Link layer accepts information from the 
Network layer and breaks the information into frames. It then adds the destina­
tion MAC address, source MAC address, and Frame Check Sequence (FCS) 
field, then passes each frame to the Physical layer for transmission.
	2.	 On the receiving side: The Data Link layer accepts the bits from the Physical 
layer and forms them into a frame, performing error detection. If the frame is 
free of errors, the Data Link layer passes the frame up to the Network layer.
	3.	 Frame synchronization: This layer identifies the beginning and end of each frame.
	4.	 Flow control: Distinguishes between control frames and information frames.
	5.	 Link management: It coordinates transmission between the transmitter and the 
receiver.
	6.	 Determine contention method: It defines an access method in which two or more 
network devices compete for permission to transmit information across the same 
communication media, such as in token passing and Carrier Sense Multiple 
Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).
Layer 3: Network Layer
The function of the Network layer is to perform routing. Routing determines the 
route, or pathway, for moving information in a network with multiple LANs. The 
Network layer checks the logical address of each frame and forwards the frame to 
 
1  Introduction to Communications Networks

15
the next router based on a routing table. The Network layer is responsible for trans­
lating each logical address (name address) to a physical address (MAC address). An 
example of a Network layer protocol is Internet Protocol (IP).
The Network layer provides two types of services: connectionless and connec­
tion- oriented services. In connection-oriented services, the Network layer makes a 
connection between a source and a destination, then starts transmission. In a con­
nectionless service, there is no connection between source and destination. The 
source transmits information regardless of whether the destination is ready or not. A 
common example of this is e-mail.
Layer 4: Transport Layer
The Transport layer provides the reliable transmission of data in order to ensure 
that each frame reaches its destination. If, after a certain period of time, the Transport 
layer does not receive an acknowledgment from the destination, it retransmits the 
frame and again waits for acknowledgment from the destination. An example of a 
Transport layer protocol is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
Layer 5: Application Layer
The Application layer enables users to access the network with applications such as 
E-mail, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), 
and Telnet.
 
­
1.16
Layer 5: Session Layer
The Session layer establishes a logical connection between the applications of two 
computers that are communicating with each other. It allows two applications on 
two different computers to establish and terminate a session. When a workstation 
connects to a server, the server performs the login process, requesting a username 
and password. This is an example of establishing a session.
Layer 6: Presentation Layer
The Presentation layer receives information from the Application layer and con­
verts it to a form acceptable by the destination. The Presentation layer converts 
information to ASCII, or Unicode, or encrypts or decrypts the information.
Layer 7: Application Layer
The Application layer enables users to access the network with applications such as 
E-mail, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), 
and Telnet.

2.1  Introduction
In order to understand network technology, it is important to know how information 
is represented for transmission from one computer to another. Information can be 
transferred between computers in one of two ways: an analog signal or a digi­
tal signal.

2.2  Analog Signals
An analog signal is a signal whose amplitude is a function of time and changes 
gradually as time changes. Analog signals can be classified as non-periodic and 
periodic signals.

Usually an electrical signal representing voice, temperature or a musical sound, 
is made of multiple waveforms. These signals have one fundamental frequency and 
multiple frequencies that are called harmonics.
Characteristics of an Analog Signal
The characteristics of a periodic analog signal are frequency, amplitude, and phase.
Frequency  Frequency (F) is the number of cycles in one second, u
p
p er F equals StartFraction 1 Over upper T EndFraction , and is 
represented in Hz (Hertz). If each cycle of an analog signal is repeated every one 
second, the frequency of the signal is one Hz. If each cycle of an analog signal is 
repeated 1000 times every second (once every millisecond), the frequency is:

2.5  Coding Schemes
Since computers can only understand binary numbers (0 or 1), all information (such 
as numbers, letters, and symbols) must be represented as binary data. One com­
monly used code to represent printable and non-printable characters is the American 
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).

2.9  Signal Transmission
There are two methods used to transfer information over media: baseband and 
broadband transmission.
Baseband Transmission Mode
When the entire bandwidth of a cable is used to carry only one signal, the cable 
operates in baseband mode. Many digital signals use baseband transmission.
2  Data Communications

35
Broadband Transmission Mode
When the bandwidth of a cable is used to carry several signals simultaneously, the 
cable operates in broadband mode. For example, cable TV transmission works in 
broadband mode because it carries multiple channels using multiple signals over the 
cable. Broadband mode frequently uses analog signals.
2.10  Digital Signal Encoding
Digital signal encoding is used to represent binary values in the form of digital sig­
nals. The receiver of the digital signal must know the timing of each signal, such as 
the start and end of each bit. Following are some methods used to represent digital 
signals:
•	 Unipolar encoding
•	 Polar encoding
•	 Bipolar encoding
•	 Non-return to zero (NRZ)
•	 Non-return to zero inverted (NRZ-I)
•	 Manchester and differential Manchester encoding
Manchester and differential Manchester, and non-return to zero inverted (NRZ-I) 
encoding schemes are used in LANs and non-return to zero is used in WANs. Each 
encoding technique is described below.

Manchester and Differential Manchester Encoding
In Manchester and differential Manchester encoding, the clock pulse is embed­
ded into the signal. Therefore, the receiver does not require any additional signal to 
represent the clock pulse. This self-clocking feature and low error rates have made 
Manchester and differential Manchester encoding the most popular line coding 
methods for wired LANs and WANs. According to the IEEE standards, Manchester 
encoding is used in Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) networks and differential Manchester 
encoding is used in Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) networks.

2.11  Error Detection Methods
When the transmitter sends a frame to the receiver, the frame can become corrupted 
due to external and internal noise. The receiver must first check the integrity of the 
frame. Some possible sources of error are as follows:
Impulse Noise: A non-continuous pulse for a short duration is called impulse noise. 
It may be caused by a lightning discharge or a spike generated by a power switch 
being turned off and on.
Crosstalk: This type of noise can be generated when a transmission line carrying a 
strong signal is coupled with a transmission line carrying a weak signal. The 
transmission line with the strong signal will produce noise (crosstalk) on the 
transmission line with the weak signal.
2.11  Error Detection Methods

38
 
Attenuation: When a signal travels on a transmission line, the strength of the signal 
is reduced over distance. This reduction is called attenuation. A weak signal is 
more affected by noise than a strong signal.
White Noise or Thermal Noise: This type of noise exists in all electrical devices and 
is generated by moving electrons in the conductor.
The following methods can be used to detect an error or errors:
•	 Parity Check
•	 Block Check Character (BCC)
•	 One’s Complement of the Sum
•	 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

Cyclic Redundancy Check
The parity bit and BCC can detect single and double errors. The Cyclic Redundancy 
Check (CRC) method is used for detection of single error, more than a single error, 
and burst error (when two or more consecutive bits in a frame have changed). The 
CRC uses modulo-2 addition to compute the Frame Check Sequence (FCS). In 
modulo-2 addition:

The following procedure is used to calculate FCS.
At the transmitter side, the Frame M is k bits, P is a divisor of n + 1 bits, and the 
FCS is n bits and is equal to the remainder of 2n∗ M/P using modulo-2 division.
At the transmitting side, the FCS, which is the remainder from 2n∗ M/P, is calcu­
lated. The transmitter will transmit frame T = 2n∗ M + FCS to the receiver, where T 
is k + n bits.
At the receiving side, the receiver divides T by P using modulo-2 division. If the 
result of this division generates a remainder of zero, no error is detected in the 
frame. Otherwise, the frame contains one or more errors.
Example 2.7  Find the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for the following message. 
The divisor is given.
	
	
	
	
Therefore, 2n∗M = 111010000.
n∗
2.23
At the transmitter side, the FCS is added to 2n∗M, and the transmitter transmits 
frame T = 111010010 to the receiver.
2  Data Communications

41
 
At the receiver side, the receiver divides T by P, and if the result has a remainder 
of zero, there is no error in the frame. Otherwise, the message contains an error. 
Since the above division takes time, special hardware is designed to generate FCS.
CRC Polynomial and Architecture
A binary number is represented by b5b4  b3b2  b1b0, where bi represents each bit that 
can be represented by a polynomial:
	
	
Example 2.8  Represent P = 1101101 by polynomial.
	

The following CRC polynomials are IEEE and ITU standards:
	
	
	
	
	
	
The CRC method uses a special integrated circuit (IC) to generate the FCS. The 
design of this IC is based on the CRC polynomial. In general, a CRC polynomial 
can be represented by:

Summary
•	 Information transfer between two computers occurs in one of two types of sig­
nals: digital or analog.
•	 Modern computers work with digital signals.
•	 A digital signal is represented by two voltages.
•	 Binary numbering is the representation of a number in Base-2.
•	 One digit in binary is called a bit, and eight bits are equal to one byte. More than 
one byte is called a word.
•	 Information is represented and processed inside the computer in binary or 
Base-2 form.
•	 Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is used for representing decimal numbers 
from 0 to 9.
•	 ASCII code is used to represent character information inside the computer; 
ASCII code is made of 7 bits.
•	 There are two methods used for transmission of data: synchronous and asynchro­
nous transmission.
Summary

44
•	 Parallel transmission is a method by which data is transmitted byte by byte.
•	 Serial transmission is a method by which data is transmitted one bit at a time 
over a single transmission media.
•	 Asynchronous transmission adds extra bits (start bit and stop) to the character for 
synchronization.
•	 With synchronous transmission, clock pulses are used for synchronization.
•	 There are three types of communication modes: Simplex transmission, Half-­
Duplex transmission, and Full-Duplex transmission.
•	 Baseband mode uses the bandwidth of a transmission media to carry only 
one signal.
•	 Broadband mode uses the bandwidth of a transmission media to carry multiple 
signals.
•	 Digital information can be represented by several forms of digital signal, such as 
non-return to zero (NRZ), non-return to zero inverted (NRZ-I), Manchester 
encoding, differential Manchester and bipolar encoding.
•	 Some sources of error for digital communications are impulse noise, crosstalk, 
attenuation, and white noise.
•	 Parity Check, Block Check Character (BCC), One’s Complement of the Sum, 
and Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) are used for error detection in networking.

3.1  Introduction
A transmission medium is a path between the transmitter and the receiver in a trans­
mission system. The type of transmission medium is defined by the various charac­
teristics of the digital signal, including the signal rate, data rate, and the bandwidth 
of a channel. The bandwidth of a channel determines the range of frequencies that 
the channel can transmit. There are three types of communications media cur­
rently in use:
	1.	 Conductive, such as twisted-pair wire and coaxial cable.
	2.	 Fiber-optic cable.
	3.	 Wireless.

ized. Even so, CAT-7/7a cables are currently used in datacenters, and while CAT-8 
is still largely in development, CAT-8 cables are projected for use in extremely high-­
bandwidth applications in the near future.

3.3  Fiber-Optic Cable
3.5
To transmit information using optical fiber, the digital information is converted 
to light pulses by light-emitting diodes (LED) or injected-laser diodes (ILD) and 
sent through the fiber-optic cable. An LED is a diode which generates a low power 
light. At the receiving end, a photodiode or a photo transistor is used to convert the 
light pulse signals back into electrical signals.
The following are the advantages of fiber-optic cables:
•	 Longer distance transmission due to reduced signal loss (attenuation).
•	 Greater bandwidth up to the Gigahertz range.
•	 Immunity from any kind of noise or external interference such as electromag­
netic signals.
•	 Smaller size.
•	 Secure media.
Some disadvantages of fiber-optic cables are as follows:
•	 Network interface cards and cabling can be expensive.
•	 Connection to the network is more difficult.
Characteristics of Light
The source of signals for a fiber-optic cable is light. The characteristics of light are 
propagation speed, wavelength, and attenuation.
Propagation Speed  Light propagates through a vacuum at a speed of 3.0*108 m/s.
 
3.6
Equation 3.1 describes the wavelength in terms of the speed of light and the fre­
quency of a signal.

where:
C = the speed of light (3*108 m/s)
f = frequency of the signal
Attenuation of Light  Attenuation is the reduction of the strength of a signal. 
When light travels through a fiber, it loses energy. The greatest loss of energy is 
often caused by absorption. Absorption is caused by fiber materials as the optical 
power is converted to another form of energy such as heat. Attenuation is defined in 
Eq. 3.2.
	
	
(3.2)
where:
A is the attenuation in decibels.
Pt is the power of light at the transmitter side.
Pr is the power of light at the receiver side (after transmission).

3.3  Fiber-Optic Cable

54
 
Types of Fiber-Optic Cable
In a fiber-optic cable, the angle of light reflection is directly dependent upon the 
diameter of the fiber. As the diameter increases, the light is reflected more, and it 
takes more time to travel a given distance. There are two types of fiber-optics cable: 
single-mode fiber (SMF) and multimode fiber (MMF).
	 	
3.8
−6
	2.	 Multimode Fiber (MMF): In multimode fiber, more than one light ray can 
propagate through the fiber since each light ray propagates at a different wave­
length. Multimode fiber has a core diameter larger than the wavelength of the 
light source being used, which ranges from 50 micrometers to 1000 microme­
ters, where the wavelength of the light is about 1 micrometer. This means light 
can propagate through the fiber in many different ray paths or modes. A single-­

mode fiber cable has a smaller diameter than a multimode fiber cable. The MMF 
uses a light emitting diode (LED) as the source of light.
3.9
Modal Bandwidth
Modal bandwidth is specified in units of MHz*km. The modal bandwidth indi­
cates the amount of bandwidth supported by a fiber cable for a 1 km (0.625 miles) 
distance and is given by the manufacturer of the optical cable. For example, a cable 
with a modal bandwidth of 500 MHz*km can support end-to-end bandwidth of 
250 MHz at a maximum 2 km (1.25 miles) distance.
Fiber-Optic Connectors
There are three common types of fiber-optic connectors used for networking. These 
connectors are listed below.

3.4  Wireless Transmission
Wireless transmission does not use any transmission media, such as a conductor or 
optical cable, to transmit and receive information. Microwave, radio, infrared light, 
and laser are forms of wireless communication.
­
3.2
3.5  Transmission Impairment
In a communication system, the transmitter sends information in the form of signals 
such as optical, electrical, or radio frequency to the receiver. The signals are sent on 
a communication channel. The receiver side of the signal has a different shape from 
the transmitter side. This difference can be caused by attenuation, distortion, 
or noise.
 
3.12
To increase the length of a communication channel, one must use an amplifier to 
strengthen the signal. The attenuation is measured in decibels (dB) and it is defined 
by Eq. 3.3.

attenuation of the signal.
	
	
Electrical signals are used for transmission of information over a conductive 
medium that acts as a communication channel. The electrical signal travels through 
the conductor. As a result of the resistance of the conductor, the signal loses some 
voltage. This loss of voltage is called a voltage drop. Attenuation of an electrical 
signal is calculated by Eq. 3.4:

Vt is the voltage of signal at the transmitter side.

The network designer uses attenuation data to find the maximum cable length 
that can be used without using a repeater.
Example 3.2  Find the maximum length of a Cat-6 cable that transmits a signal 
with 250 MHz, assuming the voltage of the signal at the transmitter side is 5000 mV 
and at the receiver side is 200 mV.

3.6  Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, and Channel Capacity
Bandwidth
In general, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transferred over a communica­
tion link. It is categorized by the type of signal over the communication link.
Analog Bandwidth  Analog bandwidth is the difference between the highest and 
the lowest frequency in a communication channel. For example, the highest fre­
quency of the human voice is 3300 Hz and the lowest frequency of the human voice 
is 300 Hz. Therefore, the bandwidth of the human voice is simply:
	
	
Digital Bandwidth  The bandwidth of a digital link is the maximum number of bits 
per second that can be transmitted over the communication link. For example, the 
bandwidth of a T1 link is 1.54 Mbps meaning that it can transfer up to 1.54 million 
bits per second. Ethernet’s bandwidth is 10 Mbps meaning each bit takes 0.1 μs to 
get transmitted.
Latency (Delay)
Latency defines the time it takes to transmit one packet (unit of information) from 
source to destination. Latency delay consists of propagation delay, transmission 
time, and buffering time. Latency is defined in Eq. 3.5. Also, the two-way latency is 
called round trip time (RTT).
	
	
(3.5)
where:
Tx is the transmission times.
Tp is the propagation delays.
Tb is the buffering times.
Transmission Time  Transmission time is the time that it takes to put a message on 
media. If the data rate of a link is 1000 bits per second, then each bit takes 0.001 sec­
onds to put on the media. Transmission time is defined by Eq. 3.6:
	
	
(3.6)
Example 3.3  Find the transmission time for transferring 1500 bytes using a com­
munication link with a data rate of 10 Mbps.
3.6  Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, and Channel Capacity

60
	
	
Propagation Delay  Propagation delay or propagation time is the time taken by 
the signal to travel from source to destination. Propagation delay is defined by 
Eq. 3.7.
	
	
(3.7)
where:
Speed of light = 3 × 108 m/s in a vacuum and less in wire and fiber medium.
Electrical and optical signals travel considerably less than almost at the speed of 
light and are generally taken as 2.3 × 108 m/s and 2 × 108 m/s, respectively.
Example 3.4  Find the propagation time for transferring 100 bytes over 200 km of 
fiber-optic cable.
	
	
Buffering Time  A transmitted packet might be stored in several locations before 
reaching its final destination. The time a packet spends in a temporary location 
(known as a buffer) is called buffering time or queue time.
Throughput
The throughput of a communication channel is defined by the number of bits trans­
mitted over a communication link and can be shown by Eq. 3.8.
	
	
(3.8)
Example 3.5  Calculate the transmission time and the throughput of a communica­
tion link for a user to download 1500 bytes of information from a server. The user’s 
computer is connected to the server by a modem with the data rate of 50 Kbps and 
the distance between the two computers is 4000 km. Assume there is no buffer­
ing delay.

3.7  Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
SONET is a high-speed optical carrier that uses fiber optic-cable as the transmission 
media. The term SONET is used in North America and is a standard established by the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU) has also set a standard for SONET called Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 
(SDH), which is used in Europe.
SONET optical architecture is based on a four-fiber bidirectional ring to provide 
the highest possible level of service assurance. New application software, such as 
Medical Images and CAD CAM applications, require more bandwidth than other 
applications and rely on SONET for high-speed transmission with a large 
bandwidth.
3.7.1  Characteristics of SONET
The most significant characteristics of SONET are as follows:
•	 SONET uses byte multiplexing at all levels.
•	 SONET is a high-speed transport (carrier) technology with a self-correcting path.
•	 SONET uses multiplexing and demultiplexing.
•	 SONET provides operation administration and maintenance (OAM) func­
tions for network managers.
•	 The basic electrical signal for SONET is synchronous transport signal level 
one (STS-1).
•	 SONET transmits STS-1 at a rate of 8000 frames per second.
•	 Slower signals can be multiplexed directly onto higher speeds.

Regenerator: The regenerator performs the functions of a repeater. If the optical 
cable is longer than standard, the regenerator will be used to receive the optical 
signal and then regenerate the optical signal.
Add/Drop Multiplexer: Add/drop multiplexers are used for extracting, or insert­
ing, lower rate signals from, or into, higher rate multiplexed signals without 
completely demultiplexing the SONET signals.
STS Demultiplexer: STS demultiplexers convert and demultiplex optical signals to 
electrical signals.

overhead, and 9 bytes are used for path overhead. The actual data rate is 86 columns

3  Communications Channels and Media

Summary
•	 Transmission media are used to connect computers.
•	 The types of communication media are conductors, optical cable, and wireless.
•	 The types of conductors used for networking are unshielded twisted pair (UTP) 
cable, shielded twisted pair (STP) cable, and coaxial cable.
•	 UTP cable contains several pairs of wires and is divided by EIA into categories 
such as Cat-1, Cat-5, and Cat-6.
•	 Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) uses an RJ-45 connector.
•	 A coaxial cable is used for transmitting high-speed information over relatively 
long distances.
•	 A fiber-optic cable transfers information in the form of light.
•	 Light emitting diodes (LED) and laser diodes are used to convert a digital signal 
to an optical signal for transmitting information over optical cable.
•	 There are two types of optical cable: single-mode fiber (SMF) and multimode 
fiber (MMF).
•	 Single-mode fiber (SMF) only uses one ray of the light source.
•	 In MMF-grade index fiber, the index of refraction changes from maximum at the 
center to minimum near the edge of the core, causing the light to bend in a 
curved shape.
•	 Wireless transmission uses microwave, radio, or infrared light signals to transmit 
information.
•	 Microwave communication uses radio waves in the range of 1 GHz to 23GHz.
•	 Channel bandwidth is defined as the range of frequencies that passes through the 
channel.
•	 Analog bandwidth is the difference between the highest and the lowest frequency 
in a communication channel.
•	 Digital bandwidth is the maximum number of bits per second that can be trans­
mitted over a communication link.
•	 Latency (delay) defines the time it takes to transmit one packet (unit of informa­
tion) from source to destination.
•	 Attenuation is the loss of energy in a signal after transmission.
Summary

68
•	 The synchronous optical network (SONET) is a high-speed data carrier. The 
term SONET is used in North America and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy 
(SDH) is used in Europe.
•	 SONET uses fiber-optic cable for transmission media since optical transmission 
is immune to interference and can transmit data over a long distance.
•	 SONET converts the synchronous transport signal (STS-1) to an optical signal. 
It is called OC-1 (optical carrier) and is transmitted at a rate of 8000 frames 
per second.
•	 SONET components are the STS multiplexer, the regenerator, the add/drop mul­
tiplexer (ADM), and the STS demultiplexer.
•	 The basic transmission signal for SONET is the STS-1. The frame format of 
SONET is made of 9 rows and 90 columns of bytes. The frame size is 810 bytes 
and this frame is transmitted at a rate of 8000 frames per second, which gives a 
bit rate of 51.84 Mbps for STS-1.
•	 Three STS-1 signals can be multiplexed and converted to an optical signal to 
generate an OC-3 with a data rate of 155.52 Mbps.

Fast Packet Multiplexing
Fast packet multiplexing (FPM) uses the same method as SPM and can assign 
maximum bandwidth to any input needed. FPM does not use a store and forward 
mechanism and, therefore, cannot perform error detection and correction. FPM will 
forward a packet before it has been completely received by the multiplexer.
Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)
In time division multiplexing (TDM), each end user is allocated a time slot for 
transmission. For instance, if 10 users are connected to a TDM and the bandwidth 
of the transmission link is 10 Mbps, then each user can transmit at the rate of only 
1 Mbps. One disadvantage of TDM is that each user must wait for its turn to trans­
mit its information. Code division multiplexing (CDM) is similar to TDM but 
allows all users to transmit simultaneously.

Characteristics of Chip Bits  In general, the chip bit sequence for A can be repre­
sented by A = (A4 A 3 A2 A 1) and the chip bit sequence for B can be represented by 
B = (B4 B3 B2 B1). One property of chip bits is that the inner product of two different 
chip bit sequences is zero and the inner product of the two identical chip sequences 
bits is one.
The inner product A and B is represented by and is defined by Eq. 4.1:

Advantages of Circuit Switching  Circuit switching is used for real-time commu­
nication. There is no delay or congestion in the communication link because a phys­
ical connection exits between the source and the destination.

Message Switching
In message switching, station A sends its message to the switch. The switch stores 
that message and then forwards it to the destination. The disadvantage of message 
switching is that the switch needs to have a large buffer to store incoming messages 
from other links.

Summary
•	 A multiplexer is used to share a transmission medium among several users.
•	 In time division multiplexing (TDM), the users are assigned equal time to use the 
digital channel.
•	 Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is used for analog transmission, with 
the bandwidth of the analog channel divided into smaller channels.
•	 In statistical TDM, the bandwidth is dynamically allocated to active users.
•	 Code division multiplexing allows all user to transmit simultaneously.
•	 Wavelength division multiplexing is used for transmitting multiple ray of lights 
with different wavelengths over one optical cable.
Summary

88
•	 The pulse code modulation (PCM) method is used in the central switch to con­
vert human voice to digital signal.
•	 The bandwidth of the human voice is 4000 Hz and it is digitized at a rate of 
64 kbps.
•	 A T1 link is a special digital transmission line which has 24 inputs (each input is 
64 kbps) and one output, with a data rate of 1.544 Mbps.
•	 There are three types of switching used in networking: circuit switching, packet 
switching, and virtual circuit.
•	 A message is divided into pieces. Each piece is called a packet.
•	 Packet switching treats each packet of a message separately.
•	 In circuit switching, a physical connection must be established between the 
source and destination before transmitting information.
•	 A virtual circuit is a type of packet switching. In a virtual circuit all packets of a 
message are transmitted in a specific path called a virtual path.

Error and Flow Control
Objectives
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
•	 Comprehend frame transmission methods.
•	 Demonstrate understanding of error and flow control.
•	 Draw the Logical Link Control (LLC) frame format.
5.1  The Data Link Layer
As described in Chap. 1, the Data Link layer defines the frame format and type of 
transmission. The Data Link layer performs the following functions:
	1.	 On the transmitting side: The Data Link layer accepts packets from the 
Network layer and breaks the information into frames. It then adds the destina­
tion MAC address, source MAC address, and Frame Check Sequence (FCS) 
fields, and passes each frame to the Physical layer for transmission.
	2.	 On the receiving side: The Data Link layer accepts the bits from the Physical 
layer and forms them into a frame, performing error detection. If the frame is 
free of error, the Data Link layer passes the frame up to the Network layer.
	3.	 Frame synchronization: This layer identifies the beginning and end of 
each frame.
	4.	 Flow control: Distinguishes between control frames and information frames.
	5.	 Link management: This layer coordinates transmission between the transmitter 
and receiver.
	6.	 Determine contention method: This layer defines an access method in which 
two or more network devices compete for permission to transmit information 
across the same communication media, such as Token passing and Carrier Sense 
Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).

There are several existing protocols for the Data Link layer, such as:
•	 Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC): SDLC was developed by IBM as a 
link access for System Network Architecture (SNA).
•	 High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC): HDLC is a version of SDLC modified 
by the ISO for use in the OSI model.
•	 Link Access Procedure Balanced (LAPB): HDLC was modified by ITU and it 
is called LAPB used in ISDN.
5.2  Error and Flow Control
Functions of the Data Link layer include error detection, error control, and flow 
control. During the transmission of a frame from a source to its destination, the 
frame may get corrupted or lost. It is the function of the Data Link layer of the des­
tination to check for error in the frame and inform the source about the status of the 
frame. This function must be performed in order for the source to retransmit the 
frame. One of the methods used is Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ). Positive or 
negative acknowledgement is used to establish reliable communication between the 
source and the destination. Automatic repeat request is carried out in two ways: 
Stop-and-Wait ARQ and Continuous ARQ.
Stop and Wait ARQ  In Stop-and-Wait ARQ, the source transmits a frame and 
waits for a specific time for acknowledgement from the destination. If the source 
does not receive acknowledgment during this time, the source retransmits the frame. 
This method is used for networks with a half-duplex connection.

Continuous ARQ
In continuous ARQ, the transmitter continuously transmits frames to the destina­
tion. The destination sends ACK or NACK on different channels. Continuous ARQ 
is used in packet-switching network and full-duplex connection. There are two 
types of ARQ: Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Reject ARQ.
 
5.4
5.4
 
5.5
Sliding Window Method
In continuous ARQ, the source keeps a copy of transmitted frames in its buffer until 
it receives acknowledgment for a frame; it then removes the frame from its buffer. 
The continuous ARQ has the following deficiencies:
	1.	 The destination may not have enough memory to store incoming frames.
	2.	 The source may transmit frames faster than destination can process them.
	3.	 The source must hold a copy of all unacknowledged transmitted frames in its 
buffer; therefore, the source requires a large buffer.
	4.	 The file to be transmitted is divided into packets. Each packet has a sequence 
number; if the sequence number become large, it decreases network efficiency.
 
5  Error and Flow Control

97
 
The Sliding Window Method limits the number of frames waiting for acknowl­
edgement in source. For example, a source with a window of seven means the source 
can hold only seven unacknowledged frames in its buffer. The source will stop 
transmitting once it has seven frames in its buffer and wait for an acknowledgment 
frame. When the source receives acknowledgement for a frame, it removes that 
frame from its buffer and transmits the next frame. In order to prevent the need for 
large sequence numbers, most networking protocols use the following formula for 
assigning a sequence number to each frame:
	
	
(where K is the window size of the sending station).
For Example  What is the sequence number for frame number 25? Assume that the 
window size is 7.

6.1  Introduction
In order for two computers to communicate with each other, a link between them is 
required.
Currently, about 63 million households have cable TV services, and the same 
wire that brings TV signals to your house is a cable that can also provide Internet 
access with speed 100 times faster than a dial-up modem. The device that enables 
computers to access the Internet by cable TV lines is called a cable modem. The use 
of cable TV lines for this purpose is advantageous as digital signals cannot travel a 
long distance, but analog signals can.

The modem’s speed using a 90-degree phase shift is 2*4000, which is equal to 8 
Kbps. To increase the speed of the modem, the original signal can be shifted 
45-degrees to generate eight distinct signals. Each signal can be represented by 
three bits. Therefore, the speed of the modem is increased to 3*4000, which is equal 
to 12 Kbps.

6.4  Cable Modem
The Cable Modem is another technology used for remote connection to the Internet. 
Residential access to the Internet is growing, and current modem technology can 
transfer data at only 56 kbps. Local telephone companies also offer a service known 
as Basic Rate ISDN, which has a transmission rate of 128 kbps. The cable modem 
offers high-speed access to the Internet using a media other than phone lines.

Cable TV System Architecture
6.11
The head end transmits TV signals over a trunk cable to a group of subscribers. 
The medium can be either coaxial or fiber-optic cable. The function of a coaxial 
amplifier is to amplify the signal, and it works in either direction. Feeder and drop 
cables are both coaxial cables. The drop cable is the part of a cable system that 
connects the subscriber to the feeder cable. Feeder cables are connected to trunk 
cable to cover a large area. The maximum distance between head end and subscriber 
is 10 to 15 km. The maximum number of cascaded amplifiers is 35 and the maxi­
mum number of connections is 125,000.
A TV signal transmits two frequency bands: VHF (very high frequency) and 
UHF (ultra-high frequency). The VHF channels use lower frequencies to generate 
stronger signals needed to transmit longer distances. The VHF channels start at 
channel 2 with frequency of 54 MHz and end at channel 13 with frequency of 
216 MHz. UHF channels start at channel 14, with a frequency of 470 MHz and end 
at channel 83 with frequency of 890 MHZ. Each TV channel occupies 6 MHz of the 
TV radio frequency (RF) spectrum.

Cable Modem Technology
6.13
6.14
A cable modem uses 64-QAM or 256-QAM modulation techniques to transmit 
information from the head end to the cable modem (downstream transmission). If a 
cable modem uses 256-QAM, this means 8 bits per signal and each signal is trans­
mitted at 6 MHz. Theoretically the data rate of a cable modem is:
	
	
By using 64 QAM modulation, the data rate becomes
	
	
Upstream transmission (from cable modem to head end) uses a 2 MHz channel 
between 5 and 42 MHz. This low frequency is close to the CB radio frequency. The 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation method is used. The data rate 
of the cable modem for upstream transmission becomes:
6  Modulation Methods, Cable Modems, and FTTH

111
 
 
	
	
Downstream and upstream bandwidths are shared by 500 to 5000 cable modem 
subscribers. If 100 subscribers are sharing a 36 Mbps connection, each user will 
receive a data at rate of 360Kbps. A cable modem provides a constant connection

(like a LAN); it does not require any dialing. The cable modem head end communi­
cates with the cable modem, and when the cable modem is commanded by cable 
modem head end, the modem will select an alternate channel for upstream 
transmission.
IEEE 802.14
A cable modem operates at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. The 
IEEE 802.14 standard provides a network logical reference model for the media 
access control (MAC) and physical layer. The following are general requirements 
defined for the cable modem by IEEE 802.14:
•	 Cable modems must support symmetrical and asymmetrical transmission in both 
directions.
•	 They support Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions.
•	 They support a maximum of 80 km distance for transmission from head end to 
the user.
•	 They support a large number of users.
•	 MAC layer should support multiple types of service, such as data, voice, 
and images.
•	 MAC layer must support unicast, multicast, and broadcast service.
•	 MAC layer should support fair arbitration for accessing the network.
6.5  Fiber to the Home (FTTH)
The demand for digital TV in the home, such as IPTV and HDTV, is growing fast. 
Most service providers offer bundle services that include HDTV, phone, and Internet 
services. This brings the question of how much bandwidth is needed to able to sup­
port standard digital TV, HDTV, phone, and Internet in a single home. Standard 
digital TV (SDTV) displays an image at a rate of 24 f/s (frames per second) and this 
rate is variable based on the country. In European countries, this rate is 25 f/s, while 
in North America it is 30 f/s. The SDTV frame is made of 650* 480 pixels, and to 
display a pixel, it requires two bytes. Therefore, the total bytes needed to display a 
frame are:
	
	
HDTV (high-definition TV) frames are made of 1920* 1080 pixels and use 3 
bytes for displaying a pixel in color. Therefore, the required bandwidth for a single 
HDTV is:
	
	
6  Modulation Methods, Cable Modems, and FTTH

113
The central head end (CO) compresses each frame before transmission. The 
most popular compression algorithms are MPEG-2, with typical compression ratio 
of 50/1, and MPEG-4, with compression ratio of 100/1.
SDTV uses MPEG- 2, so the bandwidth requirement becomes 140.4/50 = ~3 Mbps
HDTV uses MPEG-4, so the bandwidth requirement becomes 1493/100 = ~15 Mbps
A typical Internet user requires 2 Mbps.
The bandwidth retirement of VOIP is 100 kbps, which is negligible.
With this data, the bandwidth requirement for a house with two HDTVs, one 
SDTV, 4 Internet users, and a phone can be estimated as:
	
	
In order for a service provider to provide 41 Mbps bandwidth, fiber to the home 
technology can be used.

7.2  Ethernet Operation
Each network card has a unique physical address. When a station transmits a frame 
on the bus, all stations connected to the network will copy the frame. Each station 
checks the address of the frame, and if it matches the station’s NIC address, it will 
accept the frame. Otherwise, the station discards the frame. In an Ethernet network, 
each station uses the CSMA/CD protocol to access the network in order to transmit 
information. CSMA/CD works as follows:
7  Ethernet Technologies

121
	1. 	If a station wants to transmit, the station senses the channel (listens to the chan­
nel). If there is no carrier, the station transmits and checks for a collision as 
described in part 2. If the channel is in use, the station keeps listening until the 
channel becomes idle. When the channel becomes idle, the station starts trans­
mitting again.
	2. 	If two stations transmit frames at the same time on the bus, the frames will col­
lide. The station which first detected the collision sends a jamming code on the 
bus (a jam signal is 32 bits of all ones), in order to inform the other stations that 
there is a collision on the bus.

•	 Unicast: Recipient is an individual station.
•	 Multicast: Recipients are a group of stations.
•	 Broadcast: Recipients are all stations in the network. The 48-bit destination 
address is set to all ones, meaning that the DA address is FFFFFFFFFFFF in 
Hex, for a broadcast address.
•	 Source Address (SA): The SA shows the address of the source from which the 
frame originated.

7.2.2  Ethernet Characteristics
The gap between each frame should not be less than 9.6 ms. A station can have a 
maximum of ten successive collisions. The size of the jam signal is 32 bits of all 1’s. 
The maximum size of the frame is 1512 bytes including the header. Slot time is the 
propagation delay of the smallest frame. The smallest frame is 512 bits, and each bit 
time is 10−7 seconds; therefore, the propagation delay of the smallest possible frame 
is 512-bit time.

Fast Ethernet is an extension of the Ethernet standard with a data rate of 100 
Mbps, still using the Ethernet protocol. The goal of Fast Ethernet is to increase the 
bandwidth of Ethernet networks while using the same CSMA/CD transmission pro­
tocol. Using the same protocol for Fast Ethernet allows users to connect an existing 
10BaseT LAN to a 100BaseT LAN with switching devices.
7.3.1  Fast Ethernet Media Types
One of the most popular media types for a Fast Ethernet network is unshielded 
twisted-pair wire, because it is easy to work with and it is a less expensive medium. 
The IEEE has approved specifications for the following three types of media for 
Fast Ethernet:
•	 100BaseT4: 100 Mbps, Baseband, 4 pair Cat-3 cabling
•	 100BaseTX: 100 Mbps, Baseband, Cat-5 cabling
•	 100BaseFX: 100 Mbps, Baseband, fiber-optic cabling

MLT encoding uses three voltage levels: +V, -V, and Zero. The MLT encoding 
rules are as follows:
	1.	 If the next bit of the original signal is zero, then the next output is the same as the 
preceding value.
	2.	 If the next bit of original signal is one, then the next output value has a transition 
(high to low or low to high).
	
(a)	 If the preceding output was either +V or –V, then the next output value 
is zero.
	
(b)	 If the preceding output was zero, then the next output is nonzero (it is the 
opposite sign of the last none-zero output).

The conversion from four bits to five bits changes the data rate from 100 Mbps 
to 125 Mbps respectively. NRZ-I digital encoding reduces the frequency of trans­
mission by half.
7.3.2  Fast Ethernet Repeaters
Repeaters are used to expand the network diameter. There are two types of repeaters 
used in Fast Ethernet: Class I repeaters and a Class II repeaters. The Class I repeater 
converts line signals from the incoming port to digital signals. This conversion 
allows different types of Fast Ethernet Technology to be connected to LAN seg­
ments. For example, it is possible to connect a 100BaseTX station to a 100BaseFX 
station by using a Class I Repeater. A Class II repeater repeats the incoming signal 
and sends it to every other port on the repeater. Most networks now use the switch, 
a layer two device, to expand a network.
7.4  Gigabit Ethernet Technology
With recent advances in the PCI bus and CPU technologies, workstations are getting 
faster. Today’s PCI bus can transfer data at gigabit speed. A 64-bit PCI bus runs at 
533 MHz and can transfer data at up to 6.4 gigabits per second. Gigabit Ethernet 
7  Ethernet Technologies

129
transfers data at one gigabit per second, or 10 times faster than Fast Ethernet. 
Gigabit Ethernet is technology compatible with Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, and it is 
used for backbones with gigabit switches.
Gigabit Ethernet is used for the campus backbone by connecting gigabit switches 
together. The switches operate in store-and-forward or cut-through technology. The 
IEEE 802 committee has developed a standard protocol called Quality of Service 
(IEEE 802.1p) which corresponds to the network layer of the OSI model. The 
IEEE802.1p standards provide tagging for each frame, indicating the priority or 
class of the service desired for the frame to be transmitted.
7.4.1  Gigabit Ethernet Standards
In 1995, the IEEE 802.3 committee formed a study group called the IEEE 802.3z 
Task Force to research and develop standards for Gigabit Ethernet. In 1996, the 
Gigabit Ethernet Alliance was formed by more than 60 companies to support the 
development of Gigabit Ethernet.
7.4.2  Characteristics of Gigabit Ethernet
Gigabit Ethernet is used for linking Ethernet switches and Fast Ethernet switches, 
as well as for interconnecting very high-speed servers. Gigabit Ethernet enables 
organizations to upgrade their networks to 1000 Mbps while using the same operat­
ing systems and the same application software. The following are the characteristics 
of Gigabit Ethernet:
•	 Operates at 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
•	 Uses the IEEE 802.3 frame format and maximum frame size
•	 Supports full-duplex and half-duplex operation
•	 Uses the CSMA/CD access method for half-duplex operation and supports one 
repeater per collision domain
•	 Uses optical-fiber and copper wire for transmission media
•	 Supports 200-m collision domain diameters

7.5  10 Gigabit Ethernet
The IEEE 802.3ae task force completed the standard for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 
GbE) in March 2002. The 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard defines two types of physi­
cal layers: the LAN physical layer (LAN PHY) and the WAN physical layer 
(WAN PHY). The WAN physical layer operates at the rate that is compatible with 
OC-192C and it uses Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM).
Applications of 10 Gigabit Ethernet for LANs are:
•	 Connecting a server to a switch with 10GbE
•	 Connections between switches
Applications of 10 Gigabit Ethernet for WAN are:
•	 Connecting two campus networks
•	 Storage Network Architecture (SNA)
•	 Connecting multiple networks in one metropolitan area with 10 GbE to offer 
services such as distance learning and video conferencing
7.5.1  Characteristics of 10 Gigabit Ethernet
The following points describe the characteristics of 10 Gigabit Ethernet:
•	 Uses the Ethernet frame format
•	 Uses the minimum and maximum Ethernet frame sizes
•	 Supports only full-duplex connections
•	 Uses optical cabling as a transmission medium

The suffix for Gigabit Ethernet consists of three characters: the first character 
indicates the wavelength of the laser, S, L, or E, where:
S represents a short wavelength laser with a wavelength of 850 nm.
L represents a long wavelength laser with a wavelength of 1310 nm.
E represents an extended long wavelength laser with a wavelength of 1550 nm.
The second letter of the suffix represents the type of physical layer where:
R means physical layer for LAN.
W means physical layer for WAN.

Introduction
Local area network (LAN) interconnection devices are used to expand the LAN to 
cover a larger geographical area and divide the traffic load by internetworking. By 
linking local area networks (LANs) to form a single network, such as separate 
LANs of different floors of a building or LANs in separate buildings, networks can 
be connected so that all computers in one site are linked. The devices discussed in 
this chapter are used for linking LANs together and can be distinguished by the OSI  
(Open system interconnection) layer at which they are operating.

Functions of a Bridge

Bridges are capable of filtering, which is useful for eliminating unnecessary 
broadcast frames. They can also be programmed not to forward frames from spe­
cific sources. By dividing a large network into segments and using a bridge to link 
the segments together, the throughput of the network will increase. If one segment 
of the network has failed, the other segments connected to the bridge can keep the 
network alive. Bridges also extend the length of the LAN. While stations A and B 
are communicating with each other, stations C and D can communicate with each 
other simultaneously.
Learning Bridge or Transparent Bridge  The learning bridge requires no initial 
programming. It can learn the location of each device by accepting a frame from the 
network segment and recording the MAC address and the port number. The frame 
comes to the bridge, which then retransmits the frame to all the segments of the 
network except the segment which sent the frame. By using this method, the learn­
ing bridge learns which station is connected to which segment of the network.
8.3  Switch
LAN switching is the fastest growing technology in the networking industry. 
Switches are used to connect LAN segments together to increase network through­
put. A switch is a device with multiple ports which accepts packets from the ports 
of other computing devices. Switches can operate in layer 2 or layer 3.

8.3.1  Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
8.6
In order to overcome loop problems, each switch runs the spanning tree algo­
rithm (STP), also known as the standard IEEE 802.1d. The STP operation is 
described in the following steps:
	1.	 Each switch is identified by an 8-byte ID. This ID is a combination of a two-byte 
priority field and the switch’s 6-byte MAC address.
	2.	 The switches exchange their IDs using Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU). The 
switch with the lowest ID is elected as the root bridge/switch.
	3.	 The root bridge/switch places all its ports in the forwarding state.
	4.	 Each nonroot bridge/switch finds the shortest path to the root bridge. The port 
used for shortest path to root bridge is call root port and is placed in forward­
ing state.
	5.	 If a switch has more than one path to the root bridge, all ports not in the forward­
ing state are placed in the blocking state.

8.3.3  Switch Classifications
The manufacturers of switches classify the switches based on their applications: 
symmetrical and asymmetrical switching.
8  LAN Interconnection Devices

147
	1.	 Symmetric switching provides switching between segments that have the same 
bandwidth. For example, 10Mbps to 10Mbps or 100Mbps to 100Mbps.
	2.	 Asymmetric switching provides switching between segments of different band­
widths. For example, 10Mbps to 100Mbps or 100Mbps to 10Mbps.
8.3.4  Layer 3 Switch (L3 Switch)
A layer 3 switch (L3 switch) is a type of router that uses hardware rather than soft­
ware. An L3 switch, sometimes called a routing switch, uses ASIC switching tech­
nology. This switch operates on the Network layer of the OSI model. The function 
of an L3 switch is to route the packet based on the logical address (layer 3) informa­
tion. An L3 Switch accepts the packet from the incoming port and forwards the 
packet to the proper port based on a logical address, such as an IP address. In order 
to increase performance, the switch finds the route for the first packet and estab­
lishes a connection between the incoming and outgoing port for transferring the rest 
of the packets. This is called “route once and switch many.”
8.4  Virtual LAN
A virtual LAN (VLAN), also known as the IEEE 802.1q standard, is a configura­
tion option on a LAN switch that allows network managers the flexibility to group 
or segment ports on an individual switch into logically defined LANs. There are two 
immediate benefits from a VLAN. First, it provides a way for network administra­
tors to decrease the size of a broadcast domain and second, VLANs can provide 
security options for administrators. A VLAN is one way to prevent hosts on virtual 
segments from reaching one another. Another application of a VLAN is for logical 
segmentation of workgroups within an organization.

The functions of each subfield of the Tag field are described below:
TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier): This field is 16 bits and is set to 8100 (Hex) to 
identify the frame in IEEE 802.1q.
Priority: This field is 3 bits and identifies the priority of the frame.
CFI (Canonical Format Indicator): The CFI bit is mainly used for compatibility 
between Ethernet and token ring Networks and is set to 0 for Ethernet Switches.
VID (VLAN ID): This field is 12 bits and represents the VLAN number to which the 
frame belongs.

8.11
A router which can be configured manually by a network administrator is called 
a static router and a router that is configured by itself is called a dynamic router. In 
a static router, the routing table is administered manually by the network adminis­
trator who determines the route. In a dynamic router, the router uses routing algo­
rithm to find the best route and updates it routing table automatically. The dynamic 
router also exchanges information with the next router on the network.

Summary
•	 LAN interconnection devices are repeaters, bridges, routers, switches, and 
gateways.
•	 A repeater is used to extend the length of the network and operates at the physical 
layer of an OSI model. A repeater accepts traffic from its input and repeats it at 
its output.
•	 A bridge is used to connect segments of same-type networks; the function of the 
bridge is to analyze the incoming frame’s destination address and forward the 
frame to the proper segment. Bridges operate on the data link layer of the 
OSI model.
•	 A learning bridge or transparent bridge learns the location of each station by 
recording the NIC address and the port number of which frame enters the bridge.
•	 A source routing bridge routes the frame based on information in the routing 
field of the frame.
8  LAN Interconnection Devices

151
•	 A switch accepts a packet from one port and examines the destination address; it 
then retransmits the packet to the port having a host with the same destination 
address.
•	 When the number of users is increased in an Ethernet LAN, the number of colli­
sion will increase. To overcome this problem, Ethernet LAN can be segmented, 
with each segment connected to a port on a switch.
•	 Symmetric switch: It provides switching between LAN segments with the same 
data rate.
•	 Asymmetric switch: It provides switching between LAN segments with different 
data rates.
•	 Virtual LAN (VLAN): The IEEE802.10 committee approved the standard for 
VLAN. In VLAN, the switch port can be enabled and disabled by a network 
administrator. The administrator can also connect several ports to make a VLAN.
•	 Layer 2 switch: A multiport device that operates on layer 2 of the OSI model.
•	 Layer 3 switch: A type of router that uses integrated switching technology.
•	 A router is used to route a frame from one LAN to another LAN according to its 
routing table. Routers operate in the network layer of the OSI model.
•	 A gateway is used to convert one protocol to another protocol and operates in all 
seven layers of the OSI model.

networks. In 1969, DARPA created the Advanced Research Project Agency 
(ARPA). In the same year, ARPA selected Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), a 
research firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to build an experimental network 
(ARPANET) to provide a test bed for emerging network technology. ARPANET 
originally connected four nodes, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), 
the University of California Berkeley (UCB), Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and 
the University of Utah, to share information and resources across long distances. 
ARPANET experienced rapid growth with the addition of universities. At that time, 
the protocol used in ARPANET was called the network control protocol (NCP). 
NCP did not scale well to the growing ARPANET, and in 1974, TCP/IP was 
introduced.

Internet Address Assignment
Any organization wishing to connect its network to the Internet must contact the 
Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) to obtain an Internet Protocol 
address (IP address). The following are the Internet Network Information addresses:

Website: www.internic.net
E-mail: Hostmaster@internic.net
Mailing address: Network Information Center
    333 International
    Menlo Park, CA 94025.
Any organization that obtains a network IP address will submit its server’s name 
to InterNIC. InterNIC will ensure that no two servers have the same name. For 
Example: elahia1@ southernct.edu is the author’s Internet address. Reading from 
right to left, the above domain name consists of:
edu: A top level domain which represents that Elahi is at some US educational site.
southernct: Represents the organization which owns the machine that has informa­
tion about Elahi’s IP address.
9.1  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is comprised of 13 members; six of whom 
are selected by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The functions of the 
IAB are the following:
•	 Determining the future of Internet addressing
•	 Architecture of the Internet
•	 Direction of IETF: Management of a top-level Domain Name System
The following is a list of the subcommittees of the IAB and their functions:
	A.	 IESG: The Internet Engineering Steering Group works on Internet standards 
and oversees the work of all the other groups.
	B.	 IETF: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open international 
committee of network designers, vendors and researchers. The IETF is divided 
into subgroups, which are organized based on their area of expertise, such as 
routing or transport.
	C.	 IRTF: The function of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is to promote 
long- and short-term research related to Internet protocols such as TCP/IP, 
Internet Architecture, and IPv6.
	D.	 IANA: The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) works under the 
Internet Network Information Center (INIC). The INIC consists of Network 
Solutions Inc. and AT&T Corp. The function of the INIC is registration of 
domain name servers (DNS) and education services. INIC manages registration 
of the second level domain names under the following top-level domains:
gov, com, edu, net, mil, biz, info, name, coop, aero, net and org.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
SMTP is used for E-mail (electronic mail), which is used for transferring messages 
between two hosts. To send a mail message, the sender types in the address of the 
recipient and a message. The electronic mail application accepts the message/mail 
(if the address is right) and deposits it in the storage area/mailbox of the recipient. 
The recipient then retrieves the message from his/her mailbox.
An E-mail address (or just “email”) is made up of a Username @ Mail Server 
Address. For example, in Elahia1@southernct.edu, “Elahia1” is the username and

“southernct.edu” is the domain name of the mail server. The “southernct” stands for 
Southern Connecticut State University, and “edu” stands for education.
Some email addresses are little more complicated, for example, Elahi@scsu1.
southernct.edu. Here, “Elahi” is the username, “scus1” is the name of a workstation 
that is a part of “southernct,” and “edu” is the top-level domain representing an 
education center.
Telnet or Remote Login
Telnet is one of the most important Internet applications. It enables one computer 
to establish a connection to another computer. Users can login to a local computer 
and then remote login across the network to any other host. The computer establish­
ing the connection is referred to as the local computer and the computer accepting 
the connection is referred to as the remote or host computer. The remote computer 
could be a hardwired terminal or a computer in another country. Once connected, 
the commands typed in by the user are executed on the remote computer. What the 
user sees on their monitor is what is taking place on the remote computer.
Remote login was originally developed for Berkeley UNIX to work with the 
UNIX operating system only, but it has since been ported to other operating sys­
tems. Telnet uses the client/server model. That is, a local computer uses a Telnet 
client program to establish the connection. The remote or host computer runs the 
Telnet server version to accept the connection and sends responses to requests.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an Internet standard for file transfer. It allows Internet 
users to transfer files from remote computers without having to log into them. FTP 
establishes a connection to a specified remote computer using FTP remote-host-­
address. Once connected, the remote host will ask the user for identification and a 
password. Upon compliance, the user can download or upload files.
9  Internet Protocols Part I

161
Some sites make files available to the public. To access these files, users can 
enter anonymous or guest for identification and use his/her Internet address as a 
password. This application is called anonymous FTP.
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is an advanced file retrieving program that can access distributed and linked 
documents on the Web. Messages in HTTP are divided into request and response 
categories and work on the client/server principle. The request command is sent 
from the client to the server. The response command is sent from the server to client.
HTTP is a stateless protocol which treats each transaction independently. A con­
nection is established between a client and a server for each transaction and is ter­
minated as soon as the transaction is complete.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
SNMP provides information for monitoring and controlling a network. It is used by 
network administrators to detect problems in networks such as issues with routers 
and gateways. SNMP is divided to the two parts; SNMP management system and 
SNMP agent. The SNMP management system issues commands to the SNMP 
agent, and the SNMP agent responds to the commend. The SNMP management 
system can mange network devices remotely.
DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS provides a way for users to easily remember websites. Memorizing a word 
such as “Yahoo” is much easier than memorizing numbers like “67.195.160.76”; 
therefore, the host name of a website is represented by a word rather than an IP 
address. However, for a client computer to access a website, send an E-mail, or con­
nect to another computer through the Internet, the client computer must have the IP 
address of the destination. To obtain the IP address of the host, the client uses DNS 
to consult the DNS server and translate the word to the corresponding IP address.
9.4  Transport Level Protocols: UDP and TCP
The Transport level of the TCP/IP protocol consists of UDP (User Datagram 
Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The UDP protocol performs 
an unreliable connection service for receiving and transmitting data. TCP performs 
reliable delivery of data by adding a sequence number to each packet. When a 
packet reaches its destination, the destination acknowledges the sequence number 
of the next packet that it expects to receive.

9.4.2  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
Most applications prefer to use reliable delivery of information. TCP offers reliable 
delivery of information through the Internet and gives users a way to transmit data 
in a reliable fashion. In TCP, before data are transmitted to the destination, a logical 
connection (not a physical connection) must be established before the information 
9  Internet Protocols Part I

163
 
is transmitted. TCP assigns a sequence number to each packet. The receiving end 
checks the sequence number of all packets to ensure that they are received. When 
the receiving end gets a packet, it responds to the destination by acknowledging the 
next sequence number. If the sending node does not receive an acknowledgment 
within a given time, it retransmits the previous packet.
9.7
9.8
The following describes the function of each field in a TCP packet:
Sequence number: The number label for each packet sent by the source.
ACK sequence number: Acknowledges the next packet expected to be received 
from the source.
Header length: Identifies the length of the header in 32-bit word.
Flag bits: Six bits used for establishing a connection and disconnection.
URG
ACK
PSH
RST
SYN
FIN
URG: Urgent Pointer is set to “1” when that field contains urgent data.
ACK: ACK bit is set to “1” to represent that the acknowledge number is valid.
PSH: Set to “1” means the receiver should pass the data to an application as soon as 
possible.
RST: Resets connection.
SYN: Set to “1” when a node wants to establish a connection.
FIN: Set to “1” means this is the last packet.

9.5  Internet Level Protocols: IP and ARP
Internet level protocols consist of the IP, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), 
Reverse ARP, and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
Internet Protocol Version 4(IPv4)
9.9
The following describes the function of each field in an IP packet:
Version: Contains 4-bit IP version number, and the current number, which is 
4 (IPV4).
Header length: Represents the number of 32-bit words in the header. If there are no 
IP options and padding, header length is 20 bytes (5 words). IP is an unreliable 
service so there is no acknowledgment from the destination to the source. There 
is also no physical connection between the source and destination. As such, IP 
datagrams can arrive at the destination out of order.
Type of services (TOS): TOS is 8 bits. For most purposes, the values of all bits in 
TOS are set to zero; meaning that the normal service unused bit is always zero.
Precedence indicates the importance of a datagram (0 is normal, 1 is next impor­
tant). TCP/IP Protocol ignores this field.
 
9.5  Internet Level Protocols: IP and ARP

166
 
D, T, and R identify the type of transport the datagram requests. D is for Delay, 
T is for throughput, and R is for reliability.
D = 0  Normal delay
D = 1  Low delay
T = 0  Normal throughput
T = 1  High throughput
R = 0  Normal reliability
R = 1  High reliability
Total length: This field identifies the total length of the datagram (including the 
header) in bytes.
Identification: This is a number created by the sending node. This number is 
required when reassembling fragmented messages. The identification field is 
used by the destination to put together related datagrams.
Fragmented offset field: The offset field represents the offset of data in multiples 
of eight; therefore, the fragment size should be multiples of eight.
Example: 1000 bytes are to be transferred over a network with an MTU of 256 
bytes. Assume the header of each datagram is 20 bytes. Find the number of data­
grams if the following information is given:

9.6  IPv4 Addressing
An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number which forms a unique address for each host con­
nected to the Internet. No two hosts can have the same IP address. The assignment 
and maintenance of IP addressing is maintained by InterNIC. An IP address is writ­
ten in dotted decimal (Base10) notation and is represented by four 8-bit binary num­
bers with the range of 0 to 255 (4 × 8 = 32 bits).
Binary (Base2)    00000000 to 11111111
Decimal (Base10)        0  to  255
IP addresses are organized into the following five classes:
	1.	 Class A IP Address
9.10
9  Internet Protocols Part I

169
 
The first most significant bit of a Class A IP address is zero.
The Network ID is 7 bits.
The Host ID is 24 bits.
The range of a Network ID is from 0 to 127. The numbers 0 and 127 are reserved.
The range of Class A addresses is from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 in dotted decimal.
	2.	 Class B IP Address
9.11
The first two most significant bits of a Class B address are 1 and 0.
The Network ID is 14 bits.
The Host ID is 16 bits.
With a Class B address we can have 214 (16,384) networks, and each network can 
have 216 (65,536) hosts or nodes.
The range of a Class B Network ID is from 128.0. to 191.255.
	3.	 Class C IP Address
9.12
The first 3 bits of a Class C address are 1, 1, and 0.
Twenty-one bits are used for Network ID, and 8 bits are used for the Host ID.
A Class C IP address can handle 221 networks, where each network can have 256 
host IDs.
The range of a Class C Network ID is from: The IP address of 192.0.2.1 was 
never assigned and used for test purposes only.
	4.	 Class D IP Address
Class D address is reserved for multicasting. In multicasting, a packet is sent to 
a group of hosts.
9.13
	5.	 Class E IP Address
Reserved for research, the range of a Class E addresses is from 240.0.0.0 to 
247.255.255.255.
9.6  IPv4 Addressing

170
 
 
 
9.6.1  Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) or Classless 
IPV4 Address
In a classless IP address, the Network Prefix is flexible represented by the follow­
ing form,
	
	
where n defines the number of bits for the Network Prefix. For example, the Class 
C IP address 192.10.20.1 uses 24 bits for the prefix and 8 bits for the host ID, which 
means that it can generate 256 IP addresses. This Class C IP address can be used as 
a CIDR address based on the number of Host IDs needed to determine prefix bits. If 
n = 16, then the IP address 192.10.10.1/16 has 16 bits for the network prefix and 16 
bits for the host ID. Therefore, it can generate 216 IP addresses where the starting 
address is 192.10.0.0/16 and the ending address is 192.10.255.255.
Assume a company needs 1000 IP addresses and only Class C addresses are 
available. This company is only able to use Class C addresses as classless addresses 
to assign the IPs to the interfaces.
CIDR Address Assignments
The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates a block of IP address to 
each ISP (Internet Service Provider). The ISP then distributes these IP addresses to 
their customers.
Assume a Network Information center allocates the block IP address 
206.0.64.0/18 to Comcast. Comcast will have 232–18 = 214 IP addresses. If an organi­
zation requires 800 IP addresses, then Comcast will give the following addresses to 
the organization.
210  =  1024 therefore, comcast allocates 10 bits of its host ID to this 
organization.
9  Internet Protocols Part I

171
The organization address starts at 206.0.01000000.00000000 = 206.0.64.0/22 
and ends at 206.0.01000011.11111111 = 206.0.67.
Subnetting and Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR)
In a classless IP address, the leading bits of the Host ID are used for Subnetting. The 
network prefix and new subnetting make the Extended network prefix.
Example 9.1  The classless IP address 169.194.168.82/27 is a host address.
	(a)	 Find the number of addresses in the network.
	(b)	 What are the starting and ending addresses?
	
a.	 Since the Prefix is 27 bits and 32–27 = 5, there are 25 Host ID addresses.
The starting address is:
	
	
where the least significant 5 bits are for the Host ID.
	b.	 The starting address is: 10100111.11000010.10100000.01000000.
The last address is 10100111.11000010.10100000.01011111.
Example 9.2  An organization is granted IP addresses 15.24.74.0/24. The organiza­
tion has three networks. Network A with 120 addresses, Network B with 60 
addresses, and Network C with 32 addresses. Assign addresses to each network.
The size of the Host ID is 32–24 = 8 bits. So, the total number of addresses avail­
able for the organization is 28 = 256.
Network A requires 120 addresses that use 7 bits for the host ID, where 27 = 128 
addresses.
Network A’s IP addresses start at 00001111.00011000.01001010.00000000/25.
The ending address for Network A is 00001111.00011000.0100101
0.01111111/25.
Network B requires 60 addresses, so it requires 6 bits, where 26 = 64 addresses.
The starting address of Network B is the next address after the ending address of 
Network A.
The starting address of Network B is 00001111.00011000.0100101
0.10000000/26.
The ending address of Network B is 00001111.00011000.01001010.10111111/26
.
Network C requires 32 addresses, and it uses 5 bits for the Host ID. The starting 
address of Network C is the next address after the ending address of network B.
The starting address of Network C is 00001111.00011000.0100101
0.11000000/27.
The ending address of Network C is ­00001111.00011000.01001010.11011111/27.
9.6  IPv4 Addressing

172
Loopback IP Address
The last address of each class is used as a loopback address for testing. The loop­
back address is used on a computer to communicate with another process on the 
same computer.
The loopback addresses are:
Class A  127.0.0.1
Class B  191.255.0.0
Class C  223.255.255.0
Network Addresses
The host portion of network address is set to zero. For example, 129.49.0.0 is a 
network address, not a node address. No node is assigned to 0.0.
Broadcast Addresses
The host portion is set to all ‘1’s in a broadcast. A packet with a broadcast address 
is sent to every node in the network. For example, address 129.49.255.255 is a 
broadcast address.
Private IP Addresses
The following IP addresses are reserved for ‘private’ networks
10.0.0.0      to  10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0    to  172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0  to  192.168.255.255
169.254.0.0  to  169.254.255.255.
9.7  Assigning IP Addresses to a Network
9.14
 
The subnetwork ID is 8 bits, implying that we can have 256 networks in the uni­
versity with 255 nodes each. Each subnet ID is prefixed with the network ID. The 
following subnet IDs are assigned to each department as follows:
9  Internet Protocols Part I

173
 
Subnet 1 (129.47.1.x) to the Computer Science Department.
Subnet 2 (129.47.2.x) to the Mathematics Department.
Subnet 3 (129.47.3.x) to the Biology Department.
Subnet 4 (129.47.4.x) to the link connected to the Internet.
Subnets 5 to 255 are unused and reserved for future use.
The network ID for the CS dept. is 129.47.1.0.
The network ID for the Math department is 129.47.2.0.
The network ID for the Bio department is 129.47.3.0.
In each subnet, there are 8 bits for host ID, meaning hosts can be assigned an 
address ending in the range 1–254.
IP addresses for the hosts on the CS department subnet are:
Node A’s IP address: 129.47.1.1.
Node B’s IP address: 129.47.1.2.
IP addresses for the hosts on the Math department subnet are:
Node C’s IP address 129.47.2.1.
Node B’s IP address 129.47.2.2.
IP addresses for the hosts on the Bio department subnet are:
Node A’s IP address: 129.47.3.1.
Node B’s IP address: 129.47.3.2.
In this example, the router has four ports, and each requires an IP address. Port 
R0, connected to CS Department, needs an IP on the same subnet, which would be 
129.47.1.3. Similarly, port R1 is 129.47.4.1, as it is on the internet link subnet, and 
ports R2 and R3 are 129.47.3.3 and 129.47.2.3, respectively.

	1.	 The client sends a SYN packet to the server by setting the SYN flag to one and 
selecting a sequence number in TCP packet format (assume the sequence num­
ber is X).
	2.	 The server responds to the Client by setting the SYN bit to 1, the ACK bit to 1, 
the acknowledge field to X + 1, and the sequence number to Y (sequence number 
of server). This packet is called a SYN-ACK packet.
	3.	 The client then transmits the ACK packet with the ACK bit set to one, the 
Sequence number set to X + 1, and the ACK number (ACKnum) set to Y + 1.
	4.	 Now that the connection has been established, the client sends 200 bytes of data 
to the server with sequence number X + 1, ACKnum Y + 1, and the ACK bit 
set to 1.
	5.	 The server responds by sending 100 bytes of data back to the client, with the 
ACK bit set to 1 and the ACKnum set to X + 201. The ACKnum is the sum of the 
sequence number and the number of bytes received.
	6.	 The client then responds with the ACK bit set to one, the sequence number 
X + 201, and the ACKNum Y + 101.

9.20
­
For IPv6, the type field would be 86DDH (hexadecimal). IP looks at the 8-bit 
protocol field, removes its header, and passes the data to a protocol depending on 
the protocol number (TCP = 6, UDP = 17, ICMP = 1 and IGMP = 6). Assuming the 
data is passed to TCP, TCP will look at the port number and pass it to the applica­
tion layer.
9.11  Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
Due to the growth of the Internet and the address limitations of IPv4, the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) approved IPv6 in 1995. The limitations that led to 
Internet Protocol Version 6 are summarized in the next paragraph.
The IPv4 address size is 32 bits and can connect up to 232, or 4 billion, users to 
the Internet. The IPv4 address field is divided into two parts: the network address 
(Network ID) and host address (Host ID). Once a network number is assigned to an 
organization, the organization might not use all host IDs in the host ID field, mean­
ing that some IPv4 addresses may not be used. Also, the number of networks

connected to the exterior gateway increases rapidly which causes the routing table 
to become too large which ultimately increases the time it takes to search through 
the table.
The IPv6 protocol will reduce the size of the routing table in exterior gateways 
because IPv6 uses a hierarchical scheme to define an IP address. IPv6 has the fol­
lowing features:
•	 Expanded addressing
•	 Simplified header format
•	 Support extension
•	 Flow labeling
•	 Authentication and privacy
The IETF developed IPV6 and published the IPV6 document RFC 2460 in 1994. 
IPv6 has the following features:
	1.	 Larger address space.
An IPV6 address is 128 bits which gives IPv6 an address range of 2128, which is 
equivalent to
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,770,000,000 addresses or
340 × 1036, as compared to the address space of IPV4, which results in only 232, 
or 4294967296, IPV4 addresses.
	2.	 IPV6 contains less headers than IPV4.
9.21
IPV6 Header Explanation
Traffic class: Identifies different priorities.
Flow label: Used by the source to label the packets that require special handling by 
the routers such as real time service.
	3.	 Hierarchical addressing (prefix).
IPv6 uses 16 bits to represent the organization address.
	4.	 Auto configuration.
	
(a)	 Stateless (RFC2462): The host can automatically configure its IPv6 address 
based on the prefix advertised by router.
	
(b)	 Stateful (DHCPv6): A DHCP server assigns an IPv6 address to the host.
	5.	 Supports authentication and encryption.
IPSec is mandatory for IPV6, but it is optional for IPV4.
	6.	 Transition techniques to IPv4.

	7.	 IPV6 does not require NAT (Network Address Translation).
	8.	 Support for multihoming.
Multihoming allows an organization’s network to be connected to two or more 
Internet Service Providers to offer high reliability.

9.12  IPV6 Address Architecture
The IPv6 address is 128 bits. It is divided into eight fields of 16 bits. Each field is 
represented in hexadecimal form:
	
	
Y is 4 digits in hexadecimal or 16 bits in binary.
Example 9.3
FE45:036A:00DF:4563:879E: 0008:0005:1232
The leading zero or zeroes of each field can be dropped; the above IPv6 address 
can be represented by
FE45:36A:DF:4563:8:5:1232
If an IPv6 address contains two or more contiguous fields of all zeros, these con­
tiguous fields can be represented by a double colon; only one double colon in each 
address is allowed.
Example 9.4
FE45:436A:12DF:4563:879E: 8:0000:00000:1232 can be represented by
FE45:436A:12DF:4563:879E: 8::1232.
Example 9.5
The IPV6 address FE45:436A:0000:4563:879E:8:0000:00000:1232 can be repre­
sented by
FE45:436A:0:4563:879E: 8::1232.
IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority) is responsible for global assign­
ment of IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are generally assigned in a hierarchical manner.
IANA assigns a block of IPV6 addresses to the Regional Internet Register (RIR), 
then the RIR assigns a block of address to an ISP and the ISP assigns IPV6 addresses 
to organizations and users. The following are the list of Regional Internet 
Register (RIR).

9.14  IPV6 Address Types
IPV6 offers the following types of addresses.
	1.	 Unicast address
	2.	 Multicast address
	3.	 Loopback address
 
 
9  Internet Protocols Part I

183
	4.	 Anycast address
	5.	 No broadcast address
Unicast: The unicast address defines addresses of a single interface thatmay have 
multiple IPv6 addresses. IPV6 unicast types are:
	(a)	 Link-local address
	(b)	 Site-local unicast address
	(c)	 Global unicast address
9.26
Interface ID: The 64-bit Interface ID can be configured by:
	(a)	 EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) bits using 48-bit MAC address
	(b)	 Assign by DHCP
	(c)	 Cryptography Generated Address
­
9.27
Example  The MAC address of an NIC is 00 FE 01 12 AB CD. By inserting FFFE 
into the middle of the MAC address and changing the U bit to one, the resulting 
64-bit Interface ID is 02 FE 01 FF FE 12 AB CD.

Interface local: Used for transmission within a node.
Link-local multicast: Used for a local link and will not be forwarded to other links 
by devices on the network.
Site-local multicast: Used on single site.
Organization multicast address: This type of address is used within an 
organization.
Global multicast address: This type of address is used on the Internet and is simi­
lar to a global unicast address. Some common uses of multicast addresses are:
FF02::1
All nodes in local-link
FF02::2
All routers on the local-link
FF05::2
All routers site-local
FF02::1:2
All DHCP agents link-local
FF05::1:3
All DHCP server site-local
FF05::FB
DNSv6
Solicited Multicast Address
Every node has a unicast address and special multicast address called the solicited mul­
ticast address. The solicited multicast address of a node is represented by 
FF02:0:0.0.0:1:FFXX.XXX, where XX.XXXX is the 24-bit unicast address of the node.
9.14  IPV6 Address Types

186
 
Example  If the unicast address of a node is 2001.2400:0:0.2500:6A:2456:2CBA, 
then the solicited multicast address of the node will be FF02:0.0.0.1:FF56:2CBA.

Multicast Address for Routing Protocols
The following are some of the IPV6 multicast addresses for routing protocols:
FF02::5
OSPFv3 (OSPF IPv6) all routers
FF02::6
OSPFv3 designated routers
FF02::9
RIPng routers
Multicast Ethernet Address
An Ethernet address is 48 bits, and an Ethernet multicast address for IPV6 is repre­
sented by
33-33-XX-XX-XX-XX, where XX-XX-XX-XX are the least significant bytes of 
the IPV6 multicast address.
Example  Convert the following IPV6 multicast address to a multicast Ethernet 
address.
Replacing xx-xx-xx-xx with FF-68-12-CB results in 33-33- FF-68-12-CB.
	1.	 Loopback address
The address 0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is the IPV6 loopback address and is equivalent to the 
IPv4 127.0.0.1.

IPv6 addresses can also be referenced in URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) by 
placing the IPV6 address in brackets.

9.16  IPv6 Address Configuration
IPV6 addresses can be assigned to any host using Stateless or DHCPv6 Address 
Configuration.
Stateless Address Configuration
A node can automatically generate its IPv6 address without intervention or a DHCP 
Server by using one of the following methods to receive the 64-bit IPv6 prefix from 
a router.
	A.	 Router advertisement: Router advertises its IPv6 on the link.
	B.	 A node sends a Neighbor Discovery Packet (NDP) to all nodes on the link.
	C.	 A node sends a solicitation request to the router, and the router responds with 
the request.
A node uses the IPv6 prefix to generate an IPV6 address through the follow­
ing steps.
DHCPv6 (Stateful)
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPv6 (DHCPv6) server is used for state­
ful IPv6 configuration. DHCPv6 messages are:
DHCPv6 Solicit: This is an IP multicast message. The DHCPV6 of a client sends a 
DHCPv6 solicit message to FF02::1:2, which is the multicast address for all 
DHCPv6 (relays and servers). If received by a relay, the relay forwards the mes­
sage to FF05::1:3, the multicast address of DHCPv6 servers.
DHCPv6 Advertise: This is a unicast message sent in response to a DHCPv6 
Solicit. A DHCPv6 server will respond directly to the soliciting client if on the 
same link or through the relay agent if the DHCPv6 Solicit was forwarded by 
a relay.
9.16  IPv6 Address Configuration

188
DHCPv6 Request: After the client has located the DHCPv6 server, the DHCPv6 
request (unicast message) is sent to request an IPV6 address from DHCPv6. The 
request must be forwarded by a relay if the server is not on the same link as 
the client.
DHCPv6 Reply: An IP unicast message sent in response to a DHCPv6 request 
which can be sent directly to the client or through a relay.
DHCPv6 Release: An IP unicast sent by the client to the server, informing the 
server of resources that are being released.
DHCPv6 Reconfigure: The DHCPv6 may send IP unicast or multicast messages to 
the client/clients for a new configuration and the client/clients must respond to 
the DHCPv6 request.
9.17  ICMPv6 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
ICMPv6 is a combination of ICMP and ARP with some additional functions. The 
functions of ICMPv6 are to generate error messages and information messages.
ICMPv6 Error Messages
	(a)	 Packet is too large
	(b)	 Path MTU discovery
	(c)	 Destination unreachable
	(d)	 Time exceeded
ICMPv6 Information Messages
	(a)	 Ping command
	(b)	 Echo request
	(c)	 Echo response
	(d)	 Neighbor Discovery Protocol
	(e)	 Route Solicitation
	(f)	 Route advertisement
	(g)	 Neighbor solicitation
	(h)	 Neighbor advertisement
	(i)	 Multicast Listener Discovery
	(j)	 Multicast listener query
	(k)	 Multicast listener response
	(l)	 Multicast listener done
Neighbor Discovery Protocol
Neighbor discovery protocol is used for:
	1.	 Stateless Address configuration. The node solicits the router for the IPV6 prefix 
and the address of the default gateway.
	2.	 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
9  Internet Protocols Part I

189
	3.	 Request the link layer address of neighbors (perform ARP function).
	4.	 Determining if neighbors are reachable.
IPV6 Client Generation
On system startup, each node automatically generates a link-­local address for its 
IPv6-enabled interface. The node uses NDP protocol to request an IPV6 prefix from 
the router (64 bits) and uses EUI-64 to generate an IPV6 address for its interface.

10.1  Domain Name System (DNS)
Introduction
Memorizing a word is much easier than memorizing a long number, such as seen 
when trying to remember the word “Yahoo” vs the number “67.195.160.76”. 
Therefore, computer hostnames are frequently represented by a word rather than an 
IP address. In order for a client computer to access a website, send an email, or con­
nect to another computer through the Internet, the client computer must have the IP 
address of the destination, but this may not be known to the user. To accomplish this,

the client computer uses domain name system (DNS) to obtain resolve a known 
hostname to the IP address of the host. The RFC 881, 882, and 883, which have 
been published by IETF, explain DNS operation.

A two-letter abbreviation is used for a particular country, such as “uk” for the 
United Kingdom and “fr” for France.
An organization must register its sub-domain name with the Internet Assigned 
Number Authority (IANA). For instance, southernct.edu is registered by IANA and 
must be a unique name in its domain. Southern must also specify two DNS servers: 
primary and secondary, which hold the hosts’ names and corresponding IP addresses.
DNS Root Servers
There are 13 DNS root servers, and they support both IPv4 and IPv6; the website 
https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers shows information about DNS root 
servers.
DNS Names
DNS names use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). A FQDN is a DNS domain 
name made of its location on the TLD separated by “.”, such as cs.southernct.edu.
DNS Operation
The function of DNS is to convert the host name to the IP address much like a phone 
directory converts a name to a phone number. In order for a client computer to

access the yahoo.com web site, the client must have the IP address of the Yahoo 
server. The client must send a query to the DNS server and request the IP address of 
Yahoo. There are two methods that can be used by a client to request an IP address. 
These methods are DNS recursive queries and DNS iterative queries. By default, 
DNS uses iterative queries.
	A.	 DNS Iterative Query
yahoo.com
yahoo.com
10.2
	1.	 The client sends a query to the southernct.edu DNS server (ns1.southernct.edu) 
to resolve the name to an IP address. If Southern’s DNS server resolves the client 
request, then it will send the IP address of yahoo’s server to the client. If 
Southern’s sever does not have IP address for yahoo, the process goes to step 2.
	2.	 Southern’s DNS server sends a request to the Root DNS server, requesting the IP 
address of yahoo.
	3.	 The Root server sees that the requested information (FDQN) name has a TLD 
with .com. It sends the IP address of one of the .com servers that has the IP 
address of Yahoo’s DNS server to Southern’s DNS.
	4.	 Southern’s server sends the request to the .com TLD server to resolve the name 
to an IP address.

	5.	 The .com TLD server responds with the IP address of yahoo’s DNS server.
	6.	 Southern’s DNS server sends a request to the DNS server of yahoo (authorita­
tive) for the IP address.
	7.	 The Yahoo DNS server resolves the request and transmits the IP address to 
Southern’s Server.
	8.	 Southern’s server transmits the IP address to the client.
	B.	 Recursive Query Operation
10.3
Primary and Secondary Domain Name Servers
The function of secondary DNS server is to provide back up for primary DNS 
server. If the primary server goes down, then clients of an organization cannot 
resolve the host name to the IP address without having a backup server. A primary 
domain name server holds the zone files (resource records) used for resolving host 
names to IP addresses.

TCP connection.
Resolver
A resolver is a program that runs on a client for generating query messages from the 
server, and the same program runs on a DNS server for responding to DNS queries.

AA (Authoritative Answer Flag): This bit is set to 1 in a response to indicate that 
the server that created the response is authoritative for the zone. If it is 0, that 
means that the response is from a nonauthoritative source.
TC (truncated): This flag set to 1 means that the message was truncated, while 0 
indicates otherwise.
RD: RD = 1 means that the client has requested a recursion method.

10.2  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Introduction
Manually assigning IP addresses to host computers in a large network is very time 
consuming. To overcome this problem, TCP/IP offers Dynamic Host Configuration 
10.2  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

204
Protocol (DHCP), which is an extension of the boot protocol. DHCP uses the UDP 
protocol to communicate with a DHCP server. The client broadcasts a packet with 
the IP address 255.255.255.255 (broadcast address). The broadcasted packet con­
tains the hardware address of the client. The DHCP sever responds to this request.
DHCP Components
To have a DHCP service on a network, it requires three types of software: a DHCP 
client, DHCP server, and DHCP relay agent.
DHCP Client  Most Network Operating Systems (NOS) offer DHCP software for 
clients such as Windows 10. The DHCP client software enables the client worksta­
tion to obtain its IP address from the DHCP server automatically. Clients broadcast 
a packet to the network that has the DHCP server in its broadcast domain (i.e., the 
same segment).
DHCP Server  The DHCP server holds a range of IP addresses and responds to any 
request made by a DHCP client. Note that the DHCP server and the client host must 
be in the same broadcast domain; otherwise, the DHCP relay agent software is 
required.
 
10.6
The function of the DHCP relay agent is to accept the broadcast packet from the 
DHCP client and send the packet to the DHCP server. The relay agent changes the 
broadcast packet to a unicast address by using its own IP address, then sends it to 
the DHCP server. The DHCP server responds to the DHCP relay agent. The DHCP 
relay agent then forwards this response to the DHCP client.
The DHCP server supports different methods to allocate IP addresses to a cli­
ent host:
	1.	 Automatic allocation: DHCP assigns a permanent IP address to the host.
	2.	 Dynamic allocation: DHCP assigns an IP address to a host for a limited period 
of time (this time is called lease time). If the client does not need the IP address, 
the DHCP server can reuse this IP address and assign it to another host. This 
method is used by internet service providers to assign IP addresses to their cli­
ents in order to be connected to the Internet temporarily.
	3.	 Manual allocation: The network administrator assigns an IP address to the host 
and the DHCP server transfers that IP address to the client.
 
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

205
 
DHCP Operation
10.7
	1.	 The DHCP client does not have an IP address, and so it broadcasts a packet on 
the network requesting an IP address from the DHCP server. This packet is 
called a DHCP Discovery packet.
	2.	 The DHCP server responds to the DHCP Discovery packet by sending a DHCP 
Offer packet to the client. The DHCP Offer packet includes the client IP address, 
the address mask and the lease time (the amount of the time that the client can 
hold this address). In the middle of the lease time the client host sends a renewal 
packet to the DHCP server to find out if it can keep the same IP address for the 
next lease time.
	3.	 When the client host has received a DHCP Offer packet from the DHCP server, 
it can accept the address offered or reject it. Therefore, the client sends a packet 
to the DHCP server to inform either the acceptance or rejection of the IP address. 
This packet is called the DHCP Request packet.
	4.	 The DHCP server sends a DHCP ACK to the client in response to the client’s 
DHCP Request and informs the client of the completion of the DHCP process.
10.2  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

	5.	 The client receives the DHCP ACK packet with configuration from the DHCP 
server. Now the client is configured. If a client receives a DHCP NACK (nega­
tive acknowledgment from the DHCP server), then the client host cannot use this 
IP address.
	6.	 If the client host does not need an IP address, it will send a DHCP Release packet 
to the DHCP server to release the IP address.

DHCP packet
The following describes the function of each field in the DHCP packet format:
OP code: The Op code indicates a request from a client or a reply to a request (1 for 
request, 2 for reply).
Hardware type: The hardware type indicates the type of network card being used 
(such as IEEE 802.3 or Token Ring).
Hardware length: The hardware length indicates the size of the hardware address 
or MAC address (6 bytes).
Hops: The hops field indicates the number of hops a packet can make on route to 
the destination. The maximum number of hops is 3.
Transaction ID: A random number set by the client. It is used by the client and the 
server to coordinate messages and responses.

207
Number of seconds: The number of seconds is set by the client. The secondary 
server does not respond until this time has expired.
Client IP address: If the client does not have an IP address, this field will be set to 
0.0.0.0.
Server IP address: The server IP address is set by the server.
Router IP: The router IP is set by the forwarding router.
Client hardware: The client address is set by the client and is used by the server to 
identify which client the request came from.
Server host name: optional.
Boot file name: The client can leave this field null or indicate the type of the 
boot file.
Vendor specification: This field is used for various extensions of the bootstrap.
UDP header: The UDP header contains source and destination port numbers. The 
BOOTP uses two reserved port numbers. Port number 68 is used for the client 
and port number 67 is used for the server.
10.3  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
The IETF published HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol0) documents RFC 1945 
and RFC 2616. HTTP is an application protocol for TCP that uses port 80 for com­
munications between clients and servers. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used for the 
transferring of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents. HTML is a tag, 
and hypertext documents have links to other documents such as images and videos.
The address of a web page is defined by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), 
such as http://www.southernct.edu/csdept/picture.gif
Where http is the protocol, southern is the host name, “.edu” is the TLD, and 
csdept/picture.gif is the path name.
10.10
HTTP is implemented by both client and server software. It performs the follow­
ing tasks for transferring a web page from a server to a requesting client.
	1.	 The browser makes a connection to the server over TCP port 80.
	2.	 The browser sends a request to the server.
	3.	 The server sends a response to the browser.
 
10.3  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

208
HTTP Characteristics
	1.	 HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that an http server does not keep any 
information about the clients that requested web page.
	2.	 HTTP connections: HTTP offers two type of connections called nonpersistent 
and persistent connections.
	
A.	 Nonpersistent connection: Each request and response are sent over a sepa­
rate connection and the connection is closed after a single request/response 
pair. HTTP/0.9 and HTTP 1.0 use non-persistent connection.
	
B.	 Persistent connection: All requests and responses are sent over the same con­
nection. HTTP version 1.1 uses persistent connection.
HTTP Packet Format
HTTP defines two types of packets: client packets and server packets.
	 	
10.11
SP: Space
CR: Carriage Return
LF: Line Feed
CR = %0d = \r
LF = %0a = \n
% means hex
Method: Defines the type of request sent by the client to the server, such as:
GET: Used by the client to request a document from the server and is identi­
fied by the URL.
HEAD: The HEAD method is similar to GET except that the server does not 
return a message-body in the response.
POST: Used by a client to submit information to the server.
PUT: Used for updating information on the server.

212
Time exceeded: When an IP packet travels through the Internet, the TTL field dec­
rements by one each time the packet passes through a gateway. When the TTL 
value becomes zero, the gateway sends the ICMP message of Time Exceeded.
Parameter problem: When a router discovers an error in an IP packet, the router 
discards the packet and sends a Parameter Problem to the source.
Echo request and response: An ICMP echo-request message, which is generated 
by the ping command, is sent by any host to test node reachability across an 
Internetwork. The ICMP echo-reply message indicates that the node can be suc­
cessfully reached.
10.5  Routing
­
10.16
	1.	 How does host A know that host B is connected to router R3?
	2.	 What is the best route for sending information from host A to host B? Host A can 
send packets to host B by using three different paths. Host A can send packets to 
host B using the path R1-R2-R3 or R1-R4-R3 or R1-R2- R4-R3. The router 
determines the best route for sending information by using a routing algorithm 
to build a routing table.
Link Characteristics
Routers use different metrics (link characteristics) to find the best route for sending 
a packet to the destination. The metrics are:
Hop count: The hop count measures the number of hops that a packet must go 
through in order to get to the destination.
Throughput: The data rate of the link.
Communication cost: The cost of transmitting information from source to 
destination.
 
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

213
Delay: Measures the amount of time it takes a packet to travel from source to 
destination.
Configuring the Routing Table
There are two ways to configure the routing table: dynamic routing and static 
routing.
Dynamic routing: In dynamic routing, the routers use a routing protocol to build 
their routing tables. If there is a change in the network configuration, a dynamic 
routing protocol broadcasts the changes to all the routers in the network in order 
to update all routing tables. Some of the most popular dynamic routing proto­
cols are:
	
(a)	 Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
	
(b)	 Open Short Path First Protocol (OSPF)
	
(c)	 Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
Static routing: Static routing tables are configured manually by the network admin­
istrator. Static routing is often used for small networks. The problem with this 
type of routing is that if there is a change in network topology or a network link 
failure, all the routing tables need to be manually updated.
10.17
As a network administrator, one would need to assign an IP address to each net­
work and to each host.
The following IP addresses are assigned to the following networks:
180.160.10.   the network connected to the Ethernet port of router A
180.160.20.   the serial link between router A and router B
180.160.30.   the Ethernet network connected to router B
180.160.40.   the serial link between routers B and C
180.160.50.   the Ethernet network connected to router C

In static routing, the routing table is built and updated manually. The IP routing 
table has the following fields:
	A.	 IP address of remote network
	B.	 Subnet mask
	C.	 IP address of default gateway
10.3 10.4
10.5
Router A can access the other networks through the S0 link of router B. Therefore, 
S0 is the default gateway for router A.
10.6  Networking Diagnostic Commands
TCP/IP developed networking commands for network diagnostics, such as ping, 
arp, ipconfig, tracert, netstat, and nslookup. The following commands are based 
on the Microsoft Windows OS:
	A.	 Ping command
The Ping (Packet Internet Groper) command is one of the most useful tools 
for debugging networks. It is an ICMP echo process used for checking whether a 
destination host is reachable. Ping transmits a 32-byte ICMP echo request to the 
destination and expects to receive a 32-byte ICMP echo packet from the destination. 
It also displays the time it took to transmit 32 bytes and receive 32 bytes of data.
	B.	 Address Resolution Protocol
If a router receives a packet for which it does not have the hardware address of 
the packet in its Address Resolution Protocol (arp) cache table, the router sends a 
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

215
broadcast packet to the hosts on the network and requests the hardware address of 
the host. All the hosts in the network accept the packet and compare the IP address 
of the packet with its own IP address. If both IP addresses are the same, the host will 
respond to the router with a RARP, which contains the hardware address of the host.
arp tables contain both the IP address and the MAC address of a computer. The 
following is a list of arp commands:
arp -a  Display the contents of the ARP table
arp -d  Delete an entry with an IP address
arp -s  Add an entry with a MAC address
	C.	 ipconfig /all
ipconfig displays the network settings, physical address, IP address, and subnet 
mask of the host, as well as the IP address of the default gateway.
	D.	 Tracert command
Tracert shows the path of a packet from source to destination and the number of 
gateways the packet travels through.
	E.	 Netstat command
The netstat command displays information about your network configuration. It 
comes with following options:
netstat –n  displays information on the NIC of your computer
netstat –r  displays the IP routing table
netstat –a  displays information on TCP and UDP ports
netstat –s  displays operational statistics of network protocols
10.7  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
MPLS was developed to overcome the deficiency of IP packet delivery over private 
and public networks. An IP network is connectionless and when an IP packet is 
received in a router, the router uses its routing table and the IP address of the packet 
to find the next hop. The IP address does not use a fixed size, such as class A, B, C, 
or D; therefore, it takes time to find the next hop. MPLS defines a method for fast 
packet forwarding over an IP network. It is an independent protocol, and it works 
with multiple protocols, such as IP, ATM, and Frame Relay. MPLS adds a label or 
tag to an IP packet, and it uses this label to find the path or next hop. Because the 
length of the label is fixed, it becomes faster to look up in a table than IP routing. 
Routers on an IP network use this label to find the next hop. The operation of MPLS 
is similar to cell switching in ATM networks and Frame Relay. MPLS performs the 
same function as a router but with higher performance. MPLS can be used for VPN, 
transport layer (layer 2), and connection-oriented service.
10.7  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

216
 
10.18
	 	
10.18
•	 When an LER receives an IP packet from a user network, it adds its label to 
the IP packet and uses its routing table to forward the IP packet based on the 
label value to the next label switch router.
•	 When an LER wants to transmit a packet to the user network, it removes the 
label field from the IP address and transmits the IP packet to the user network.
	B.	 Label Switch Router (LSR): The function of an LSR is to examine the IP packet 
based on its label and replace the label with a new label. The new label identifies 
the next hop to which the packet is forwarded.
10.18
­
Forward Equivalence Class (FEC): This is a group of IP packets that are for­
warded in the same manner over the same path. Therefore, a group of packets with 
same FEC can be assigned the same labels through the path. Consider that multiple 
IP packets with the same forwarding characteristics are transmitted by network A to 
network B. LER1 assigns these IP packets the same labels throughout the path. 
These packets with same FEC will use the same path. This method reduces the size 
of the routing table.
MPLS defines only the forwarding methods so other protocols are needed to 
perform routing and signaling. The routing protocol distributes the networking 
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

217
 
topology and configures the routing table by using an IP routing protocol such as 
OSPF, BGP, or RIP. Signaling protocols are used to inform the routers which label, 
and link, are to be used by the switch for each label switching path. MPL advan­
tages are:
•	 The path from source to destination can be identified in advance.
•	 It can select network paths in order to have a balanced load in the network.
•	 MPLS can provide a specific path for data.
•	 MPLS offers quality of Service (QoS) by choosing a specific path in order to 
provide bandwidth to the application, less delay, and less packet loss.
10.19
Label: This is 20 bits.
CoS (Class of Service): This field is 3 bits and is used for queuing and discarding 
packets traveling through the network.
S (Stack): This field is one bit and it is used for multiple MPLS labels.
TTL (Time-to-Live): This field is 8 bits and works similar to TTL field in IPv4.
10.8  IP Multicast
IP multicast is used for sending an IP packet to a group of receivers in a single trans­
mission. The applications of IP multicast are:
	A.	 Video/audio conferencing
	B.	 Service advertisement
	C.	 Stock distribution
	D.	 IPTV
	E.	 Transferring a bulk of data to multiple receivers
	F.	 File distribution of operating system images in a university

218
 
10.20
Characteristics of Multicast Network
•	 A multicast group is a set of hosts that all have the same IP multicast address.
•	 The transmitter of a multicast packet transmits the packet to a multicast router 
and the router transmits the packet to all hosts in the multicast group.
•	 A multicast router requires running Multicast Routing Protocol and Internet 
Group Message Protocol (IGMP).
•	 Each multicast group is identified by a single Class D IP multicast address.
•	 Members of a multicast group can be any place in a network.
•	 Each host in the network can join a multicast group.
•	 A multicast member (host) can leave the group by informing its multicast router.
•	 A receiver of a multicast packet must be a member of group.
•	 Any host on the network can transmit a multicast packet.
•	 Each multicast router manages the hosts connected directly to its port using 
Internet Group Managed Protocol (IGMP).

IGMP Messages
In general, IGMP has two types of messages:
	E.	 Membership query message
	F.	 Membership report message
10.22
A multicast router uses IGMP to learn which groups have members on each of 
their attached physical networks. It also keeps a list of multicast group memberships 
for each attached network.

10.9  Socket Programming
10.25
The following steps show an implementation of socket programming for client 
and server using Python.
	1.	 Import socket module
	2.	 Create a socket
	3.	 Binding the socket to an address and port
	4.	 Connecting to a socket
	5.	 Listening and accepting connections
	6.	 Transferring and receiving data
Socket methods: The following are lists of methods used for socket 
programming:
s.recv()  used to receive data from a socket over TCP
s.send()  used to send data to a socket over TCP
s.recvfrom()  	
used to receive data from a socket over UDP
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

221
 
s.sendto()  used to send data to a socket over UDP
s.close()  closes a socket
s.gethostname()  gets the hostname of the machine that the program is currently 
running on
	1.	 Import the socket module
import socket
	2.	 Creating a socket
A socket can be created by making call to the socket.socket() method.
s = socket.socket(socket.family, socket.type)
family: AF_UNIX is used for Unix, and AF_INET use for Internet
type: SOCK_STREAM is used for TCP protocol while SOCK_DGRAM is used for 
UDP protocol
	A.	 On the server side – create a TCP socket for listening
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	B.	 On the client side – create a socket to connect to
s = socket.socket()
	3.	 Binding the socket to an address and port. On the server side, the socket must be 
bound to the host’s IP address and port number by using bind(). If the server’s IP 
address is 192.168.1.2 and the desired listening port is 8000, then the binding 
will be:
s.bind((“192.168.1.2”, 8000)
In this model, the client does not require binding.
10.9  Socket Programming

222
	4.	 Connecting to the socket
Clients make a connection to the server by using connect() method.
s.connect(address)
where the address field is the IP address or hostname and port number of the host 
to connect to.
s.connect((“192.168.1.2”, 8000)).
	5.	 Listening and accepting connections
The server must listen to its port for incoming connections by using the lis­
ten() method:
s.listen(5)
where the argument represents the number of connections, and therefore must be 
at least 1.
Once listening, the following function is used for accepting a connection on 
that socket:
clientsocket, address = socket.accept()
	6.	 Transferring and receiving data
Data are sent and received by either the server and client using the send() or 
recv() methods:
s.send('Message12345'.encode())
data = s.recv(1024).decode()
Data must be encoded before being sent, and decoded at its destination as needed. 
The recv() method allows a buffer to be set, in this case receiving in chunks of 1024 
bytes. With this process, the following outlines the creation of two python programs 
to be used to demonstrate socket programming, a client and a server capable of 
communicating across different computers on a local area network.
Computer 1:
	1.	 Open command prompt.
	2.	 Type “ipconfig”.
	3.	 Find your IPv4 address. Either write this down or keep the command prompt open.
	4.	 We will now write code for the server using python. Start by opening notepad 
and typing the following code (everything after # is a comment and does not 
need to be typed):
import socket # imports the socket module
serversocket 
= 
socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, 
socket.
SOCK_STREAM)
host = "192.168.1.6" # set this to the IPv4 address of Computer 1
port = 8000 # you can use any port as long as another service is not using it
10  Internet Protocols Part II and MPLS

223
serversocket.bind((host, port)) # binds the address and port to the socket
serversocket.listen(5) # has the socket start listening for incoming 
connections
while 1:
(clientsocket, address)  =  serversocket.accept() # accept incoming 
connection
data = clientsocket.recv(1024).decode()
print (data)
# send a message back to the client.
clientsocket.send("You have successfully connected".encode())
Now save this file on Computer 1 as server.py and run it using Python. Keep this 
running, as the next step involves connecting to this server.
Computer 2:
Now we will create the client, open a new notepad, and type the following code:
import socket # imports socket module
s = socket.socket() # creates a new socket
host = "192.168.1.6" # set the host to the IPv4 address of Computer 1
port = 8000 # use the same port that was used on the server
s.connect((host,port)) # connects to the server
s.send('Message12345'.encode()) # sends a message to the server
data = ‘’ # creates a variable to hold the incoming message
data = s.recv(1024).decode() # accepts and stores the incoming message in data
print (data) # prints the message
s.close # closes the connection
Save this file on Computer 2 as client.py. Now run the client using Python. You 
should receive the message “You have Successfully connected.”.

Introduction
Public telephone systems are based on circuit switching networks, which allow for 
real time communication between users. Voice over IP (VoIP) technology enables 
data networks such as the Internet, LANs, and WANs to be used for voice commu­
nication. Since VoIP reduces the cost of voice communication, it has become high 
in demand for corporations and organizations which have multiple locations. 
Corporations can avoid paying extra telephone charges by setting up a VoIP network 
for long-distance communication between office locations. Voice quality is an 
important factor in the success of Voice over data networks; it is imperative that 
VoIP offers the same quality as Voice over the Public Switch Telephone 
Network (PSTN).

11.1  Voice Quality
There are three factors that impact voice quality over data networks: transmission 
delay, jitter, and packet loss.
Transmission Delay (Latency)
Transmission delay, or latency, is the time it takes a packet to travel one way from 
its destination to its source. For a one-way transmission, a transmission delay of 
between 150 and 250 m/sec is acceptable. This delay is generally caused by the fol­
lowing factors: propagation delay, the storage and forwarding of packets in routers 
and gateways, compression at the source, and decompression at the destination. 
When a voice packet is received late at the destination, it will just be discarded; the 
loss of a packet reduces the quality of the service. The latency can be reduced in 
private networks (Intranet, LAN) by adding quality of service (QoS) priority to the 
voice packets. However, the latency can not be controlled for the transmission of 
voice packets over the Internet.
Jitter Delay
Jitter delay is the difference in arrival time between packets. It is desired that the 
average arrival time between packets is constant. A variable delay is caused by con­
gestion on networks and by voice packets being sent over different paths. If voice 
packets are received by the destination at irregular times, distortions in the sound 
will occur.
Packet Loss
Voice packets are transmitted over UDP, and therefore there is no guarantee that 
packets will reach their destinations. Packets may also be dropped by gateways 
when there is congestion in the network. When a packet is dropped, the gateway 
inserts a silence packet instead; this will result in gaps in the conversation. VoIP can 
tolerate about a 2% packet loss.
11.2  Applications of Voice over IP (VoIP)
VoIP can be implemented on the Internet, a LAN, or a WAN. Currently, many cor­
porations offer long-distance calls using Voice over Internet technology at one-fifth 
of the price of using the PSTN. VoIP offers voice communication in two ways:
VoIP for an Organization
Currently, VoIP is used for telephone calls between offices in an organization by 
using the organization’s pre-existing LAN.

11.3  Voice over IP Operation
11.2
­
At the transmission side:
	1.	 The microphone accepts the voice signal and passes it to the Pulse Code 
Modulation (PCM) section.
	2.	 The PCM converts the voice signals to digital signals and passes the signals to 
the compression section.
	3.	 The compression section compresses the voice bits and forms a voice packet. 
The voice packet is then passed to the Real Time Protocol (RTP).
	4.	 The RTP adds its header to the voice packet and passes the packet to UDP for 
transmission over IP.
At the receiving side:
	1.	 The RTP passes its payload to the decompression section. The decompression 
section decompresses the voice packet and passes it to the analog-to-digital 
(A/D) converter.
	2.	 The A/D converter converts the voice packet to analog and then passes it to the 
speaker.
11.3  Voice over IP Operation

232
 
11.4  Voice over IP Protocols and Standards
Before a voice packet is transmitted over a data network, a connection between the 
two parties must exist. Currently, there are two protocols used for VoIP. They are 
H.323 developed by ITU and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) developed by 
IETF. The functions of these protocols are to set up a connection, disconnect a con­
nection, and handle call management. The SIP and H.323 protocols are used at the 
application level of the TCP/IP protocol.
Audio Codec
The function of an audio codec at the transmission side is to accept audio signals 
from a microphone and convert the audio signals to digital using an A/D converter. 
The audio codec then compresses, or encodes, the digital bits to form a voice packet. 
The function of the audio codec at the receiving side is to decompress, or decode, 
the voice packets and convert them to audio signals using a D/A converter and send 
the analog signal to the speaker.
Voice compression is performed by a device called a Vocoder (Voice Encoder/
Decoder), This device provides multiple types of voice compression. The type of 
compression is selected by a negotiation between the source and destination gate­
ways. The following are some of the voice compression standards:
Standard
Data rate
G.723
5.3 kbps/6.3 kbps
G.729
8 kbps
G.711
Uncompressed 64 kbps
Real Time Protocol (RTP)
11.3
11  Voice over Internet Protocols (Voice over IP)

233
 
The following describes the function of each field in RTP packet format:
Version (V): Defines the RTP version.
Padding (P): When this field is set to 1, it means that extra bytes were padded to the 
payload. The last byte of the payload determines the number of the bytes that 
were padded the payload; these bytes should be discarded.
Extension (X): When this bit is set to 1, it means that that header is extended (for 
experimental use).
Contributing Source Count (CC): Used for multipoint call management.
Mark (M): This bit is to inform the receiver whether the packet is from a voice 
source or a video source. For voice applications, this bit is set for the first packet 
following silent suppression. For video applications, this bit is set only for the 
last packet of a video frame.
Payload Type (PT): Determines the type of payload.
Sequence Number: The receiver uses this number to correct any packets that were 
received out of order or to detect any packet losses.
Time Stamp: The time stamp depends on the payload. If the payload is a voice 
packet, then the time stamp is 8000, which is the sampling rate of the digitized 
human voice. If the payload is a video packet, then the time stamp is the clock 
rate for the video payload, which is 9000 Hz.
Synchronization Source Identifiers (SSRC): Used for multipoint calls.
Contributing Source Identifiers (CSSRC): Used for multipoint calls.
Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP): RTCP provides a control mechanism for 
jitter delay and packet loss in RTP; it is used for end-to-end monitoring of data 
delivery. The endpoints use RTP to exchange packets that carry voice data and 
periodically they exchange RTCP packets to monitor the quality of data 
exchange.
11.5  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
SIP is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet-based protocol designed 
for call set up and call management between two or more endpoints. SIP is a signal­
ing protocol used for real time communication for VoIP such as Internet telephony 
and multimedia conferencing. SIP performs the following functions:
11.5  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

234
 
	1.	 Sets up calls between users.
	2.	 Disconnects a call between callers.
	3.	 Determines the location of the destination.
	4.	 Supports addresses resolution (converting phone addresses to IP addresses).
	5.	 Determines if the endpoint is available or not (busy).
11.4
11.6  SIP Components
The components of SIP are user agents, gateways, and servers. The following 
describes the function of each component:
SIP User Agent or SIP Endpoint
The SIP user agent can be an IP phone or a PC with the SIP protocol. The user agent 
(UA) should be able to send a SIP request and response. The UA works in client and 
server mode. The UA also communicates with other user agents through a 
proxy server.
Gateway
A gateway is a special device that connects the PSTN to the Internet.
Server
SIP defines three types of servers: proxy servers, redirector servers, and registered 
servers. These three servers can be implemented in a SIP proxy server.
SIP Proxy Server  A SIP proxy server performs the following functions:
11  Voice over Internet Protocols (Voice over IP)

235
	1.	 Accepts a user agent request and forwards the request to another user agent 
or server.
2.	 Accepts a response from a server or user agent and forwards it to a user agent.
3.	 If a proxy server does not have the IP address of the destination user agent, the 
proxy will contact a DNS server to obtain the IP address of the UA.
4.	 Requests a route on the behalf of user agent from a location server and also 
requests an IP address of the next proxy from a DNS server.
Proxy Server Types  The SIP standard defines two types of SIP proxy servers: 
stateless proxy and stateful proxy:
	A.	 Stateless Proxy Server: The stateless proxy server receives a request from a 
UA, processes the request, and forwards the response to a UA (user agent) or a 
server. The stateless proxy server does not keep any information (transactions) 
about the forwarded responses or requests. Therefore, if a response were lost 
due to congestion, the server would be unable to retransmit the response. The 
stateless proxy server is the simplest form of a proxy server.
	B.	 Stateful Proxy Server: The server also acts as client when it responds to 
requests and sends requests. The stateful proxy server keeps information about 
responses and requests. Therefore, if a packet were lost due to congestion, the 
server would be able to retransmit the packet.
SIP Redirector Server  The function of a redirector server is to accept requests and 
direct the client to contact alternate user agents (the same concept as when a secre­
tary answers a phone and gives the caller another phone number). The redirector 
uses 3XX code to respond to a request. Some of the codes are as follows:
	301	 The destination has moved permanently.
	302	 The destination has moved temporarily, and the user is available at a different 
address.
	305	 The request source should contact the proxy server.
Registrar and Location Server  The user agents register with a registrar server 
and the registrar server updates the location database (location server). The location 
database holds the address of the server that the UAs are connected to. Therefore, 
the proxy server can submit a client URL address to the location server and obtain 
an IP address of the user agent. The DNS server holds the IP addresses of the proxy 
servers.
11.7  SIP Request and Response Commands
SIP uses request and response commands to setup, change, or terminate a conversa­
tion between endpoints. A request is initiated by the client to the server, and a 
response is initiated by the server to the clients. The SIP entities use special words 
11.7  SIP Request and Response Commands

236
for requests and call methods. The following defines the methods and their 
descriptions:
Method
Description
INVITE
Used for inviting an endpoint for communication
BYE
Request for terminating a connection
ACK
Used for response to an invitation or for reliable communication between source 
and destination
REGISTER Used by a user agent to register with a registrar server
CANCEL
Used for canceling a pending call
OPTIONS
Used for requesting information about call connection such as bandwidth or 
compression methods
Response Codes
SIP uses codes for responding to a request as well. The response codes are classified 
in as follows:
Class 1XX
Used to indicate progress such as ringing and searching
Class 2XX
Used to indicate success
Class 3XX
Used for redirecting and forwarding
Class 4XX
Client error
Class 5XX
Server failure
Class 6XX
Global failure (such as busy, not available)
The following table shows some of the specific response code and their 
descriptions:

Resource Locators (URLs) for addressing

	1.	 The user agent A sends a packet called an invite to the proxy server.
	2.	 The proxy server accepts the packet and sends it to UA B.
	3.	 The proxy server sends a code 100 to user A and user A waits.
	4.	 Endpoint B accepts the invite packet, and it starts ringing (B agent is ringing).
	5.	 The proxy server passes the code 180 to UA A and A generates rings indicating 
that user B is ringing.
	6.	 When user B picks up the phone, B sends an ok packet with code 200 to the 
proxy server.
	7.	 The proxy server sends an ok packet with code 200 to user A, user A stops ring­
ing, and a session for communication using RTP is established between A and B.

11.10  Voice over IP Bandwidth Calculation
Voice packets must be received at a constant bit rate. The bit rate is dependent on the 
type of codec selection. The audio frame is made in 10 ms and the G.711 codec data 
rate is 64,000 bps. Therefore, in 10 ms, 640 bits or 80 bytes can be encoded.
11  Voice over Internet Protocols (Voice over IP)

239
 
11.7
The voice packet goes through the Network Card (Ethernet, PPP, or Frame 
Relay) and the Network Card also adds its header and trailer, assuming an Ethernet 
NIC is used. Ethernet has a 22-byte header and a 4-byte trailer, which gives a total 
of 26 bytes added to the voice packet. Therefore, the total voice packet with a 10 ms 
payload using G.711 as a codec is calculated as follows:
Voice packet = 80 bytes payload + 40 Bytes (RTP, UDP and IP) header + 26 Ethernet 
header = 146 bytes
The voice packet must reach its destination at 64,000 bits per second or 8,000 
bytes per second. The 8,000 bytes per second is equal to 100 voice packets per sec­
ond. Therefore, the bandwidth of channel should not be less than:
Bandwidth of a channel =146 bytes*100 = 116800 bps

Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
Objectives
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
•	 Discuss the applications and advantages of a wireless LAN (WLAN).
•	 Understand wireless LAN technology.
•	 Describe the applications of the ISM and UNII bands.
•	 Explain the operation of physical layers for a WLAN.

Introduction
The wireless local area network (WLAN), or IEEE 802.11, is a LAN technology 
that enables users to access an organization’s network from any location inside the 
organization without any physical connection to the organization’s network. WLAN 
uses radio frequency or infrared waves as transmission media. The WLAN is the 
next generation of campus networks. Students are able to connect their laptops to 
the campus network from any location inside the campus. In hospitals, a WLAN 
allows doctors and nurses to access patients’ files from any site in the hospital. 
Likewise, WLANs are used in warehouses and workshops. The following are some 
of the advantages of wireless LANs over wired LANs:
	1.	 Wireless LANs can be used in places where wiring is impossible.
	2.	 Wireless LANs can be expanded without any rewiring.
	3.	 Wireless LANs provide the users mobility, that is, the users can move their com­
puters anywhere inside the organization.
	4.	 Wireless LANs support roaming allowing users to move around with their lap­
tops without interrupting their connections.
	5.	 Wireless LANs are cost effective as they make it possible to move from one loca­
tion to another without the expense of connecting wires.

12.1  WLAN Components
Wireless LANs are composed of three main components: the WLAN Network 
Interface Card (NIC), Access Point, and Network Operating System.
	A.	 WLAN Network Interface Card (NIC): The WLAN Interface Card operates 
at the data link layer. The MAC frame is transmitted to the physical layer, and 
then the physical layer changes the bits to a radio frequency (RF) signal for 
transmission. Also, the physical layer accepts RF signals converted to bits.
	 	
12.1
­
Access Point (AP) operation
The Access Point operates in layer 2 of the OSI model, and its function is similar to 
a switch or a bridge:
	1.	 A client requests association with an AP, then the AP authenticates the client and 
records the client’s MAC address, informing the client that the association was 
accepted.
	2.	 The client then transmits a packet through air to the AP, and the AP checks the 
destination MAC address of the frame. If the destination MAC address is in the 
AP’s MAC table, then the AP transmits the frame through the air to its destina­
tion. Otherwise, if the destination MAC address is not in the MAC table, then the 
AP will change the frame format from IEEE 802.11 to an Ethernet II frame and 
transmit the frame to the connected wired LAN port.

Antenna Gain  The Antenna Gain is measured in dBi, where dB stands for decibel 
and i stands for isotropic. An isotropic antenna is an ideal antenna that transmits the 
RF signal in all directions equally; but real antennas do not transmit RF signals in 
all directions. Therefore, the gain of antennas is given by Eq. 12.1
	
	
	
              
	
(12.1)
where:
G is the Antenna Gain (measured in dBi)
	
	
Pi: power density of an isotropic antenna at the same distance
Pa: power density of a real antenna in specific direction and distance
where:
Pi is defined by Eq. 12.2
	
	
(12.2)
	C.	 Network Operating System: Most operating systems come with a wireless NOS.
12.2  WLAN Topologies
WLAN topologies can be classified as managed wireless networks and unmanaged 
wireless networks.
Managed Wireless Network Topologies  In a managed wireless network topol­
ogy, the AP coordinates the communications between users. Topologies for man­
aged wireless networks are the Basic Service Set (BSS) topology and the Extended 
Service Set (ESS) topology.

Distribution System (DS)  The functions of the distribution system (DS) are to 
form extended service and to provide distribution services between Access Points. 
The DS basically acts like a bridge for Access Points.
AP Operation Modes  APs can operate in the following modes:
•	 Access Point: This is the default mode of an AP, where wireless clients use an 
AP’s Service Set Identifier (SSID) to transmit packets to the AP.
•	 Wireless Repeater: Will repeat the signal of another Access Point in order to 
extend the coverage.

•	 Wireless Bridge: Will turn the Access Point into a wireless bridge. It will link a 
wireless network to a wired network.
 
12.5
12.3  Wireless LAN Technology
Two types of technology used for the transmission of information in WLANs are 
infrared (IR) technology and radio frequency (RF) technology.
12.3  Wireless LAN Technology

248
Infrared Technology  Infrared (IR) technology is suitable for indoor WLANs 
because infrared rays cannot penetrate walls, ceilings, or other obstacles. With 
infrared technology, the transmitter and receiver should see each other (be in line of 
sight) just like the remote control of a television set. In an environment where there 
are obstacles such as buildings, walls, etc., between the transmitter and a receiver, 
the transmitter may use diffused IR. However, most WLANs use RF technology.
Radio Frequency Technology  There are two types of RF signals in use for the 
transmission of information: narrowband signal and spread spectrum signal.
 
12.6
­
 
12.7
There are certain advantages of using the spread spectrum band over the narrow­
band. Some of these advantages are as follows:
•	 In spread spectrum technology, information is transmitted at different 
frequencies.
•	 It is hard to jam a spread spectrum signal; the signal cannot be disrupted by other 
signals.
•	 Interception of spread spectrum signals is more difficult than interception of a 
narrowband signal.
•	 Noise is less disruptive in spread spectrum signals than in a narrowband signal.

12.5.1  IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Operation
IEEE 802.11b and g operate at 2.4 GHz, while IEEE02.11n operates at both the 2.4 
and 5 GHz band. The physical layer signal transmission methods are Frequency 
Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).
 
­
12.9
The order of the channels used by the transmitter to transmit information to the 
receiver is predefined, and the receiver knows the order of the incoming channels. 
For example, the transmitter may use a hop pattern of 3, 6, 5, 7, and 2 for transmit­
ting information. The hop sequence can be selected during the installation of the 
WLAN. The FCC requires that a transmitter spend a maximum of 400 ms in each 
frequency for the transmission of data (this time is called the Dwell time) and use 
75 hop patterns (each hop is one channel). The FCC also requires that the maximum 
power for the transmitter in the United States should not exceed one watt.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) is more immune to noise because 
information is transmitted at different channels. In FHSS, if one channel is noisy, it 
can retransmit information on another channel.

The DSSS supports two types of modulation: Differential Binary Phase Shift 
Keying (DBPSK), which is used for a data rate of 1 Mbps, and Differential 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK), which is used for data rates of 2 Mbps.
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)  Multipath fading occurs 
when a communication signal transmitted through the air takes multiple paths to its 
destination. Due to this problem, multiple copies of the same signal will reach the 
intended target at different times. The problem may become compounded if this 
delay is greater than the time it takes to transmit a signal. This may cause what is 
known as Inter-Signal Interference (ISS), whereby a subsequent signal transmission 
arrives before a primary transmission. Applying OFDM to the transmitted signal 
will eliminate the problems associated with ISS.

12.13
OFDM has been used in IEEE 802.11a/g, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16a, and 
Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB).
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)  In OFDM, only 
one user transmits on a subcarrier channel. Multiple users transmit on subcarrier 
channels at different times, where each user is assigned subchannels for transmission.
12.5.2  IEEE 802.11b Physical Layer
The IEEE 802.11b standard extends the DSSS physical layer of 802.11 to provide 
higher data rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps. 802.11b uses Complementary Code 
Keying (CCK that may be used) to support the two data rates: 5.5 Mbps and 11 
Mbps, in addition to 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps.

The following describes the function of each field in the PLCP frame format:
Sync Field: Sync Field is used for synchronization. It is 80 bits of alternating 0’s 
and 1’s.
SFD Field: The SFD Field is 00001100 10111101.
Length Field: This field defines the length of PLCP in bytes.
Signaling: This field indicates to the physical layer the modulation type that must 
be used for transmission of the frame. The data rate is calculated as follows:

CRC-16: Is used for error detection in the PLCP header.
Service Field: This field is reserved.
IEEE 802.11b has two types of PLCP Preamble headers, Short PLCP preamble 
headers and Long PLCP preamble headers. The short PLCP Preamble header has 56 
bits for the Synchronization field and the Long Preamble header has a 128-bit 
Synchronization header.
Interframe Space
In general, the Interframe space enables the receiver to complete the frame before 
the next frame comes. The IEEE 802.11 defines three types of Interframe Spaces 
(IFS) among the frames transmitted between source and destination. They are:
	1.	 Short Interframe Space (SIFS): This Interframe Space is used for immediate 
responses such as ACK, CTS and RTS.
	2.	 Distribution Coordination Function Interframe Gap Space (DIFS): DIFS is used 
for the spacing of data frames.
	3.	 Point Coordination Function Interframe Space (PIFS): This interval is used for 
the point condition access method and the gap is used for polling of a client. The 
client should respond after this time.
12.7  WLAN Medium Access Control
The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer performs the following functions:
•	 Supports multiple physical layers
•	 Supports access control
•	 Fragmentation of frame
•	 Frame encryption
•	 Roaming
IEEE 802.11a defines distribution coordination function (Carrier Sense Multiple 
Access with Collision Avoidance CSMA/CA) and point coordination function as 
methods for a station to access Wireless LANs.

12.19
In order to reduce the probability of two stations transmitting simultaneously 
because they cannot hear each other, the standard defines a Virtual Carrier Sense 
mechanism.

12.21
	1.	 Station B wants to transmit to the AP so it senses the medium. If the medium is 
clear, it sends a short message to the AP called the Request to Send (RST). This 
message contains the destination and source addresses, and the size of the data 
to be transmitted.
	2.	 If the AP is ready to communicate with B, the AP will send a Clear to Send 
(CTS) frame to B; otherwise, it will send a busy frame. This signal can be 
detected by station C and is taken as a busy medium. Station B receives a CTS 
signal and then transmits its frame. The receiver acknowledges each frame trans­
mitted by B.
12.7  WLAN Medium Access Control

258
Point Coordination Function (PCF) Access Method
IEEE 802.11 provides the point coordination function as an optional access method. 
The AP polls each user for transmission. In the PCF method, the AP listens to the 
medium; if there is no traffic in the medium it sends a Beacon frame to all users 
indicating that the PCF method will be used for the access method and all users 
must stop transmission. Then the AP sends a poll frame to a specific user. If the user 
has any data, it will transmit; otherwise, the user will send a null frame to the AP.
12.8  MAC Frame Format
12.22
The function of each field in MAC frame of IEEE 802.11 are described as 
follows:
12.23
12.23
Protocol: Defines the protocol version. The current version is zero.
Type: Defines the type of the frame. 00 means management frame, 01 means control 
frame, and 10 means data frame.
Subtype: Defines the subframe in each type. There are several subtype manage­
ment frames.
12.23
12.4
­
12.4
More Fragment: The fragment field set to 1 indicates that more frames, belonging 
to the same application, are coming. This field set to zero indicates to the destina­
tion that the current frame is the last frame.
Power Management: This bit set to 1 indicates that the transmitter is operating 
under power management.

Duration/ID  This field contains the duration value (Network Allocation Vector 
NAV value) to inform other stations how long it will take for the source to complete 
its transmission (in microseconds). The other stations use the NAV value to defer 
their transmissions.
Sequence Number  This field is divided into two fields: a 4-bit field and a 12-bit 
field. The first four bits indicates a fragment number, and the 12-bit field indicates 
the sequence number of the frame.
12.9  WLAN Frame Types
The IEEE defines three types of frames: management frames, control frames, and 
data frames.
Management Frames  The management frame is used by a station to make a con­
nection to the AP, to disconnect the station from the AP, and for timing and synchro­
nization. Some of the management frames are:
•	 Association Request (subtype = 0000): Client sends a request frame for joining 
a BSS network.
•	 Association Response (subtype = 0001): AP responds to client request as to 
whether the AP is accepting this request or not.
12.9  WLAN Frame Types

260
•	 Reassociation (Subtype = 0010) Sending a frame by a client when moving from 
one BSS to another.
•	 Reassociation Response (Subtype = 0011): In response to reassociation, AP 
sends a reassociation frame to the client on whether it accepts the client joining 
the AP to BSS or not.
•	 Disassociation (Subtype = 1010): Used by a client to terminate its association 
with BSS.
•	 Beacon (Subtype = 1000): A Beacon frame is transmitted by the Access Point 
periodically to inform other wireless stations of its presence. This frame contains 
the following information:
	
(a)	 The Beacon interval, which is used by the station to know when to wake up 
for the next beacon
	
(b)	 Timestamp, which is used for synchronization between the Access Point and 
wireless station
	
(c)	 Types of signaling, such as FHSS and DSSS
	
(d)	 Supported data rates
•	 Probe Request (Subtype = 0101): Station requesting information from another 
station.
Control Frames  Used for flow control such as positive acknowledgement (ACK), 
RTS (Subtype = 1011), and CTS (Subtype = 1100).
Power Management  Most of the Clients in a Wireless LAN are laptop computers 
and mobile phones, and power saving is an important factor for a wireless client. 
Therefore, IEEE 802.11 defines two power management modes. They are: Active or 
Continuous Aware Mode (CAM) and Power Save polling (PSP) “sleep” mode.
Active Mode or Continuous Aware mode (CAM): In this mode, the wireless Client 
uses full power.
Power Save polling (sleep): In this mode, the wireless client goes to sleep, meaning 
that the client uses less power and turns off power to the display, disks, and other 
peripherals that are not needed.
In PSP mode, the following operations take place:
	(a)	 The client sends a frame to the AP informing the AP that the client is going 
to sleep.
	(b)	 The Access Point records the stations that are asleep.
	(c)	 The Access Point buffers the sleeping client’s frames.
	(d)	 The clients that are asleep continuously receive beacon frames.
	(e)	 The Access Point sends beacon frames with traffic indication map (TIM) which 
informs clients that were asleep that they have frames in the AP.
	(f)	 The clients that have frames in the AP switch their power mode to active mode.
	(g)	 The client sends a request for its frames.
Data Frames  Data frames are used for the transfer of information.
12  Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

261
12.10  Station Joining A Basic Service Set
In order for a client to associate with an Access Point, it must perform the probe 
phase, authentication phase, and association phase. The following describes each 
phase in detail:
Probe phase: When a station wants to join a BSS, the station needs to get synchro­
nization information from the AP (clock value of AP). This can be accomplished 
in two ways: by passive scanning and active scanning.
Passive scanning: In this method, the station can receive a beacon frame, 
which is being sent out periodically by the Access Point. This beacon frame 
contains synchronization information.
Active scanning: In this method, the station transmits a Probe request frame 
to locate an Access Point and waits for a Probe response. The Probe response 
frame contains the synchronization clock.
Association phase: If the authentication phase is completed successfully, the sta­
tion will send an association request packet to the Access Point. The Access 
Point adds the station to its association table. A station can associate only with 
one Access Point at a time.
12.11  Roaming
Roaming is when a station moves from one cell to another cell without losing con­
nection. In WLAN, moving from one cell to another must be performed between 
packet transmissions, meaning the packet must be transmitted completely before 
moving to another cell.
12.12  Wi-Fi Certification
Since there are many manufacturers of wireless equipment, it is necessary to ensure 
that all wireless devices are interoperable. Therefore, the Wireless Ethernet 
Compatibility Alliance (WECA) offers certification for wireless equipment interop­
erability, referred to as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi).
12.13  WLAN Signal Distortion
The RF signal can be distorted while going through physical obstacles such as a 
wall, a ceiling, or by multipath fading.

12.14  IEEE 802.11n
The IEEE 802.11n protocol adds several enhancements to the physical and MAC 
layers of the IEEE802.11a/b/g protocols in order to improve performance, effi­
ciency, and throughput. These enhancements are:
	1.	 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO): MIMO uses multiple transmitters and 
multiple receivers. MIMO, as defined under IEEE 802.11n, is characterized by 
the formula N*M, where N is the number of transmitters and M is the number of 
receivers ranging from 1*1 to 4*4.
	2.	 40 MHZ operation band.
	3.	 Frame aggregation: Combining two or more frames into a single frame for 
transmission.
	4.	 Block acknowledgment: Multiple packets can be acknowledged with sin­
gle packet.
	5.	 Backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11 a/b/g.
	6.	 Spatial multiplexing: Simultaneously send multiple data stream to the receivers.
12  Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

263
	7.	 Beamforming transmissions: Used to improve the signal to noise (S/N) ratio in 
order to increase the coverage area. This is applicable only for the use of one 
receiver (IEEE80.11a/b/g).
The following are IEEE 802.11n characteristics:
	A.	 Ratified date: 2009
	B.	 Operation band: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
	C.	 Modulation: up to 64 QAM
	D.	 Channel bandwidth: 20 and 40 MHz
	E.	 MIMO: up to 4*4
	F.	 Maximum data rate: 600 Mbps
	G.	 Technology: OFDM
	H.	 24 channels (20 MHz channels)
	 I.	 12 channels (40 MHz channels)
MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output)
The most important development of IEEE 802.11n is the use of MIMO (Multiple-­
Input and Multiple-Output) technology. MIMO technology consists of beamform­
ing and Spatial Multiplexing.
Beamforming
According Nyquist’s theorem, the maximum data rate of a communication channel 
is defined by the equation:
	
	
(12.3)
where S/N is the ratio of signal power to noise power.
12.25
12.26
Beamforming is useful when there is only one receiver, and it is used to expand 
the coverage area of the signal.
12.15.20  MHz bands and 40  MHz Bands  The IEEE 802.11a/g uses 20  MHz 
channel spacing with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). IEEE 
802.11a/g divides the 20 MHz channel into 52 subchannels and uses 48 subchannels 
for transmission. IEEE802.11n combines two 20 MHz channels resulting in a single 
40 MHz bandwidth channel. The 40 MHz channel is then divided into 114 subchan­
nels, with 108 channels used for transmission, resulting in a doubling of the data rate.
Spatial Multiplexing

12  Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

265
Modulation and Coding
The IEEE 802.11n protocol will negotiate its capability with clients for selection of 
spatial stream, RF modulation, coding rate, and guard interval (guard interval is the 
time between transmitted frames). The guard interval of the IEEE 802.11a/g proto­
col is 800 ns, but the guard interval of the IEEE 802.11n protocol is 400ns.
Frame Aggregation
IEEE 802.11n combines multiple frames into a single frame for transmission. There 
are two types of frame aggregation:
	1.	 Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit (A-MSDU)
	2.	 Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU)

266
Guard Interval (GI)
The guard interval is the space between sequentially transmitted frames. It is used 
to ensure that frames taking a longer path will not collide with newly transmitted 
frames. IEEE 802.11a/g defines an 800 ns guard interval but IEEE 802.11n uses a 
400 ns guard interval.
Coding Rate
The coding rate defines the useful data in a packet. Extra bits are added to packets 
for forward error correction. If the useful information is represented by K bits and 
N represents the total bits in the packet, then the code rate is denoted by K/N.

ZigBee Node Operation  The ZigBee node can operate as a full function device 
(FFD) or reduced function device (RFD) for specific operations. The full function 
device operates in the full IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer, while the reduced function 
device performs only a limited number of tasks.
ZigBee Device Types  ZigBee offers following device types:
	A.	 Coordinator: A coordinator is a FFD and is responsible for overall network 
management. Each network has exactly one coordinator. The coordinator per­
forms the following functions:
•	 Selects the channel to be used by the network.
•	 Starts the network.
•	 Defines how addresses are allocated to nodes or routers.
•	 Permits other devices to join or leave the network.
•	 Holds a list of neighbors and routers.
•	 Transfers application packets.
	B.	 Router: A router is a FFD which is used in tree and mesh topologies to expand 
network coverage. A router performs all functions like a coordinator except for 
the establishing of a network.
	C.	 End Device: An end device is a RFD that performs the following functions:
•	 Each end device (child) can be connected to a router or coordinator (parent).
•	 Can join or leave a network at will.
•	 Transfers application packets.
	D.	 ZigBee Trust Center (ZTC): The ZigBee Trust Center is a device which pro­
vides security management, security key distribution, and device authentication.
	E.	 ZigBee Gateway: The ZigBee Gateway is used to connect the ZigBee network 
to another network, such as a LAN, by performing protocol conversion.

Area Network (HAN), where each meter is equipped with ZigBee node. The AMI 
network is connected through a gateway and to a server. The Home Area Network 
consists of a connected washer, dryer, thermostat, and display. The Smart Energy 
network can perform the following functions:
•	 The utility company can read the meters at any time.
•	 Smart energy enables the utility companies to give specific information to cus­
tomers regarding how to save energy.
•	 Detects power interruption and location.
•	 The meter can receive commands and, in the case of emergency, turn off cus­
tomer power.
•	 Notify customer of high peak, allowing the customer to reduce consumption.
•	 Customers can receive time-based pricing, allowing them to make smart energy 
choices.
•	 Time-based billing report (monthly, weekly or daily).
•	 Communicates in two ways: from meter to central utility and from central utility 
to meter.
Another application profile is the RF4CE Remote control. Radio Frequency for 
Consumer Electronics (RF4CE) is a protocol developed by a consortium of compa­
nies as such as Freescale, Texas Instruments, OKI, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, 
and Sony. It defines a standard specification for designing remote control devices 
for the TV, VCR, and DVD player. The characteristics of a RF4CE device are as 
follows:
•	 Does not require line-of-sight to the receiver.
•	 Supports two-way RF communication between the controller node and the tar­
get device.
•	 Communication between target devices.
•	 Enables the remote control to display device status.
•	 Supports paging to locate the remote control.
•	 Operates in 2.4 GHz.

13.1.6  IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC Layer)
The MAC layer performs data services (transmits and receives frames from the 
upper and lower layers) and management services. The management services per­
form following functions:
•	 End device association and disassociation.
•	 In a coordinator, it offers optional Guarantee Time Slot (GTS) for each device 
accessing the network.
•	 In a coordinator, it generates the beacon frame.
•	 Provides Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) 
as the access method for the network.
•	 Provides reliable connection between two MAC layers by using an acknowledg­
ment frame.
Device Address and PAN ID  Each node is assigned a unique address which can 
either be a 64-bit address assigned by the IEEE or a 16-bit short address. Each net­
work is assigned a 16-bit PAN ID (Personal Wireless Network ID).
13.1  ZigBee

280
 
MAC Layer Scanning Channels  The MAC layer can perform the following chan­
nel scanning operations:
•	 Energy Detection: Energy detection is used by a coordinator to measure the 
energy level of selected channels in order to select the best channel.
•	 Active Scan: The active scan is used to determine if any network is in its vicinity. 
This is done by sending a beacon request command.
•	 Passive Scan: The full functional device or reduced functional device listens for 
any beacon transmitted by any coordinator. A passive scan is used by a device in 
order to join a network.
•	 Orphan Scan: Orphan scan is used by a device which has lost its parent and is 
trying to re-associate itself with the parent device.
 
13.5
13.6
The FCS is calculated over the MHR and MAC payload parts. FCS uses CRC 
G(16) = X16 + X12 + X5 + 1
Frame Type  000 denotes a Beacon Frame, 001 a Data Frame, 010 an Acknowledge 
Frame, 011 a Command Frame, and 100–111 are all reserved.
PAN ID Compression  This bit indicates if the destination device is located in the 
same network or a different network as the source device.
Source and Destination Addresses Mode  00 means indirect addressing, 10 means 
16-bit addressing, and 11 means 64-bit addressing.
Frame Pending  This field indicates there is more data being held for this device 
which the device can request.
Auxiliary Security  ZigBee does not support MAC layer security.
13.1.7  ZigBee Network Layer
The Network Layer performs Data and Management services. Management ser­
vices are as follows:
13  Low Power Wireless Technologies for Internet of Things (IoT)

281
 
 
•	 Configuration of new devices: Configures a new device in order to be the coor­
dinator or simply as a device joining to the network.
•	 Starting a network: Only performed by the network’s coordinator.
•	 Addressing: The coordinator and routers can assign addresses to each end device 
joining the network.
•	 Neighbor Discovery: Discovers one hop neighbors, recording their addresses 
and capabilities.
•	 Route Discovery: Finds the most efficient route over which to transfer messages 
to a destination.
•	 Discover other networks.
•	 Security: Applies the security protocol to outgoing and incoming frames.
•	 Joining and leaving a network
•	 Establishing Network Topologies: Star, Mesh or Tree.
•	 Address Assignment: Stochastic Address Assignment is used by ZigBee Pro. 
ZigBee Pro uses a Mesh Topology and each node when joining the network is 
assigned a random number from 0 to 65,536. The device will broadcast a device 
announcement to inform the other devices of its presence in the network. If any 
device in the network discovers an address conflict with the new device, a con­
flict notification will be broadcasted, and the parent of the child will assign 
another address to the child.
•	 Distributed scheme (Cskip): used by a network with tree topology.
Routing  The function of a router in a ZigBee network is to provide a routing pro­
tocol so that a message may be routed from a source to a destination. ZigBee sup­
ports the following routing protocols:
•	 Tree Routing
•	 Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV)
•	 Many-to-one
•	 Source routing
13.1  ZigBee

282
13.1.8  Application Layer
The application layer consists of application objects (endpoints) which hold user 
applications and ZigBee Device Objects (ZDOs). Each node has 240 endpoints 
meaning each node can have 240 sensors.
ZigBee Security  ZigBee provides message integrity, authentication, freshness and 
privacy for a ZigBee device.
•	 ZigBee security uses Counter Mode (CTR) with 128-bit AES for the encryption 
of messages.
•	 ZigBee security uses Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with 128-bit AES for the 
generation of the Message Integrity Code (MIC).
•	 ZigBee security uses symmetric keys for all levels of security.
•	 ZigBee security can apply cryptography and frame integrity at the application 
and network layers.
ZigBee Security Keys and Trust Center  ZigBee defines three types of keys for 
security: the link key which is used for the application link key and Trust Center 
Link, as well as the Network Key and Master Key.
Application Link Key  This key is used for security of application data between 
two devices and it is shared only between two devices. An application link key may 
be preconfigured, distributed by a trust center to the devices, generated from a mas­
ter key, or installed using the Symmetric-Key Key Establishment (SKKE) protocol.
Trust Center Link Key  This key is used by the trust center and devices on the 
network for securing communication between the trust center and devices. This key 
is preconfigured in the devices.
13.1.9  ZigBee Security Modes
Standard Mode  Standard security mode is used by ZigBee and ZigBee Pro. 
Standard security uses two network keys that are transmitted by the trust center to 
the devices for encryption and decryption.
High Security Mode  High security mode is used by ZigBee Pro. The high security 
mode provides all functions supported by standard security with the following addi­
tional functions:
•	 Entity authentication: This is used by two devices to authenticate each other 
based on their active network key.
•	 Permission table: This table indicates which devices have permission for using 
commands such as permission to join or leave.
•	 Generating link keys between devices using the SKKE protocol.
•	 Two network keys
•	 The trust center holds network keys, master keys, and list of devices

form of broadcasts and receives from multiple gateways within the range. The gate­
ways then transmit the packets to a network server. With this design, the network 
server will receive multiple copies of a packet and select one of the packets to trans­
mit to the appropriate application server. For example, if the packet belongs to the 
gas meter, then the network server will transmit the packet to the Gas Meter Server 
(an application server).
End Device Identifiers  Each end device has the following identifiers:
	A.	 Device Identifier (DevEUI): This is a 64-bit unique identifier which is set by 
vendors or developers.
	B.	 End Device Address: Each end device has a 32-bit address which is used for 
communication between the end device and gateway. The device address is 
unique in the network and assigned by the network server to the device during 
the join process.
	C.	 Application Identifier (AppEUI): AppEUI is a unique identifier for the applica­
tion server that assigns to the end device. This is used by the network server to 
send the packet to the appropriate application server.
LoRa Gateway  The LoRaWAN gateway is connected to the network server 
through Ethernet or the Internet. The end device transmits the packet to gateway, 
then the gateway demodulates the received signals, adds the following information 
to the packet, and then transmits to the network server:
	(a)	 The arrival time of the packet
	(b)	 SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio)
	(c)	 RSSI (Receive Signal Strength)
	(d)	 Data rate
	(e)	 Channel number
The gateway listens to multiple channels and processes multiple packets. In a 
LoRaWAN with multiple gateways, the end device broadcast message may be 
received by multiple gateways. The gateways transmit the packets to the network 
server, then the network server will select the best packet based on signal quality 
and reject rest of the packets.
Network Server  The network server performs the following functions:
	A.	 The network server receives the data packets from multiple gateways and 
removes duplicate packet if received by multiple gateways then transmit one 
packet to the application server.
	B.	 The communication between the Gateways and application servers can use by 
Public or Private Networks
	C.	 The network server responsible for managing end devices and Gateways such as 
device Join request, device authentication, assign an address to the end device, 
and register new device.
	D.	 The Network Server supports channel re-configuration. It will automatically 
disable channels on the node that are not being used by the network.
13  Low Power Wireless Technologies for Internet of Things (IoT)

287
	E.	 The network server can implement Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) for the end 
device. The ADR is used to assign the best data rate to end device with the least 
transmission power.
	F.	 The network server uses information when receiving the packet from the gate­
way, such as the SNR or SSR to select the best gateway for the downlink 
transmission.
Application Server  The application server is connected to the network server. It 
decrypts incoming packets and encrypts outgoing packets using the Application 
Session Key.
Join Server  The function of the join server is to activate and de-activate the end 
device, as well as to also generate session security keys.
13.3.3  LoRaWAN Protocol Architecture
13.12
The physical layer consists of LoRa Modulation with regional ISM bands. The 
LoRa physical layer uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation which enables 
LoRaWAN to consume low power and transmit rf signals up to 15 km.
LoRa MAC Layer
The LoRa MAC Layer offers three different types of end-user operations, those 
being Class A, Class B, and Class C. The LoRa MAC Layer performs the following 
functions:
 
13.3  LoRa Wide Area Network Technology (LoRa WAN)

288
	A.	 Determine end device type and its operation
	B.	 Defines access method
	C.	 Generates security keys
	D.	 Defines Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)
LoRaWAN defines the three types of end device operations as Class A, Class B 
(Beacon), and Class C (Continuous)
 
­
13.13
Class B  Class B receives a Beacon frame from the gateway which contains the 
schedule for allocating a time slot for transmission. The end devices of Class B 
consume more energy than Class A.
Class C  End devices of Class C are in receiving mode can receive the packet at any 
time. They will only switch to transmitting mode when transmitting. Class C end 
devices will use more power to operate when compared with Class A and Class B.
LoRaWAN Access Method  LoRaWAN uses the Aloha Protocol as an access 
method. In the Aloha Protocol, the device transmits and waits for an acknowledg­
ment. If the device did not receive acknowledgment, then it assumes a collision 
occurred and the device re-transmits according to a back-off algorithm.
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)  The ADR is a method that can adapt the data rate of 
the channel based on the strength of radio signal, the S/N. If the S/N is small, then 
the data rate must be lowered (using a higher Spreading Factor). Selecting a lower 
SF results in a higher data rate.
13.3.4  LoRaWAN Security
When a node requests connection to LoRaWAN, then the network server and nodes 
generate several keys that are used for security, authentication, and message integ­
rity. The LoRaWAN specification defines two versions of LoRa Security, version 1, 
and version 1.1. LoRAWAN version 1 only uses one root key called the APPKey 
(Application Key) to generate the Application Session Key and Network Session 
Key for security. To address the shortcomings of security version 1, the LoRa 
Alliance published LoRaWAN security version 1.1.
 
13  Low Power Wireless Technologies for Internet of Things (IoT)

289
LoRaWAN Version 1.1 Security
LoRa defines two methods that an end device can use to join a LoRaWAN, and they 
are as follows:
	A.	 Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA)
	B.	 Activation by Personalization (ABP)
Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) and Security Keys Generation
The Join process consists of a Join Request sent by an end device to the Network 
Server, and the Network Server then sends a response to the end device before an 
end device can join the LoRaWAN network. The end device and Network Server 
share two root keys called the NewkKey (Network Key) and AppKey (Application 
Key). These two keys are used to generate the Network Session Keys, Application 
Session Key, and Joint Session Keys. The following identifications are stored in the 
end device:
	A.	 Device Identifier (DevEUI): It is a 64-bit unique identifier which is set by ven­
dors or developers.
	B.	 JoinEUI: It is a global Application ID using IEEE EUI 64 that identifies the 
Join Server
	C.	 Application Keys: AppKey and NewkKey (Network).

Introduction
Cryptography is a technique used to establish secure communications and is used 
frequently in the case of network security. Information flowing across public spaces 
such as the internet drives a need for encrypted communications to prevent eaves­
dropping or any other malicious activity. Additionally, cryptography can assist in 
verifying the integrity of data to ensure that it is not modified or otherwise altered in 
transit. There are two main types of network attacks:
	(i)	 Direct Attack: The attacker is able to disrupt the system by breaking passwords 
accessing the system to modify information. For example, a person breaks the 
security of a bank server and then alters the account information.
	(ii)	 Indirect Attack or Passive Attack: The attacker obtains the information and 
data in a system (such as a name, address, social security, or credit card num­
ber). For example, a person using a cable modem can use a packet sniffer to 
capture packets transmitted over the modem and obtain sensitive information. 
A packet sniffer is a piece of software that captures packets traveling in and out 
of a network. The packet sniffer is used for network monitoring or analysis. The 
following are some common attacks used against an organization’s network:

294
•	 Eavesdropping or Packet Sniffing: The attacker intercepts network data or 
authentication information.
•	 Impersonation: The attacker will impersonate a user and create unauthor­
ized content such as email messages.
•	 Denial of Service (DoS): Make the network resources unavailable.
•	 Replay Messages: Gain access to a data packet, change information within 
it a then retransmit the falsified information.
•	 Password Cracking: Breaking the password by using dictionary or brute 
force attacks.
•	 Guessing of Encryption Key: Guessing encryption key in order to decrypt 
information.
•	 Port Scanning: To find open and insecure ports and services which may be 
exploited.
14.1  Elements of Network Security
In order to have secure network, the following network security components are 
necessary:
	 (i)	 Confidentiality: Confidentiality, or secrecy, means that information being sent 
through the network must remain unknown to unauthorized people. This is 
handled through the use of various encryption methods.
	(ii)	 Authentication: Authentication methods verify the identity of a person or 
computer accessing the network.
	(iii)	 Authorization: To prevent unauthorized access.
	(iv)	 Integrity: Integrity maintains data consistency and prevents tampering with 
information.
	(v)	 Non-repudiation: Non-repudiation provides proof of origin to the recipient.
14.2  Introduction to Cryptography

14.1
In this model, the message is referred to as plaintext or cleartext and the 
encrypted text is called ciphertext. The plaintext is encrypted by an encryption 
algorithm and an encryption key. The ciphertext is then transmitted over the com­
munication channel. At the receiving side, the ciphertext is decrypted by a decryp­
tion algorithm and a decryption key resulting in plaintext. The encryption and 
decryption algorithms are called Ciphers. Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking

ciphers or decrypting information without having the key. Cryptography can be 
divided into two classes:
	A.	 Classical Cryptography: Classical cryptography was used in the early days for 
non-computing applications such as character substitution and transposition 
ciphers.
•	 Substitution Cipher: Substitution replaces each character in the text with a 
different character. This is an early cryptography method that was developed 
by Caesar and is known as the Caesar Cipher. Caesar Cipher substitutes the 
original letter with a different letter that comes later in the order of the alpha­
bet. For example, the letter “A” is replaced with the 4th letter in the alphabet, 
substituting “A” with “E.” Another method of substitution is to add a number 
to the ASCII value of the letter. The ASCII value of “A” is 41h. Adding 4 to 
41h results in 45h (the letter “E”). The number 4 is the value of the key.
Example 14.1  Encrypt the word “BOOK” assuming the encryption key is 4.
The word “BOOK” in ASCII code is 41, 4F, 4F, 4B. Adding 4 to each character 
results in 45, 53, 53, 4F which stands for “ESSK.”
•	 Transposition Ciphers: In a transposition cipher, the plaintext is divided into 
groups of characters where the number of groups defines the key. For exam­
ple the phrase “WELCOME TO CLASS” is divided into groups of 4 charac­
ters as shown below.

•	 Reading from column 1 to 4, the ciphertext is “WOTLEMOALE-SC-CS.” In 
this example the key is 1234. Also note that the order of the key can be 
changed to 2341.

	B.	 Modern Cryptography. Modern cryptography is now used for modern data 
communication. The types of modern cryptography are symmetric key cryp­
tography (private key or secret key) and asymmetric key cryptography or 
public key cryptography.
Symmetric Cryptography
14.2
Plaintext is encrypted using an encryption algorithm and a key, resulting in 
ciphertext which is then transmitted to the receiver. The receiver uses the same key 
as the transmitter to decrypt the ciphertext into plaintext. Some of the symmetric 
cryptographies are RC4, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Blowfish, and 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
The advantages of symmetric cryptography are that it is simple and fast. The 
disadvantage is that the transmitter and the receiver must possess the same key, 
meaning that there must be some sort of transfer mechanism. The symmetric algo­
rithm can be divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers.
Stream Ciphers  The plaintext is encrypted one bit at a time, text is converted to 
binary, and then the binary string is XORed with another binary string (the key), 
resulting in ciphertext. An example of a stream cipher is the RC4 algorithm.
Example 14.2
The word “BOOK” in binary form is
1000010  1001111  1001111  1001011
The encryption key is
0111111  0111110  0111010  1010101
14.3
­
Block Ciphers  A block cipher is a group of bits that are encrypted. Some of the 
symmetric cryptography algorithms using block cipher are the Data Encryption 
Standard (DES) that takes 64 bits per block and the Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES).

14.3  RC4 Algorithm
RC4 was developed by Ron Rivest and it is also called Ron’s Code. RC4 is a sym­
metric key stream cipher which encrypts bit by bit. The RC4 encryption algorithm 
consists of two sub-algorithms, and they are as follows:
	A.	 Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)
	B.	 Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)
Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)
KSA consists of two sub-algorithms, initialization of State Array or S-box and 
scrambling of State Array.
	A.	 Initialization State Array
The RC4 algorithm uses an array of 256 elements which is represented by S[I] 
where the value of I goes from 0 to 255 and is initialized to a state where S[I] = I.
Initialization Algorithm
For I= 0 to 255
S[I] = I means S[0] = 0, S[1] = 1, S[2] = 0, S[3] = 0, …. 
S[255] = 255,
or it can represent S[I] in the following form:
S =[0, 1, 2, 3, …….255]
	B.	 Scrambling of Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)
The encryption key is represented by K[I] and it is L bytes long. The scrambling 
KSA is represented by:
Set J=I
 For I = 0 to 255    then
 J= (J+ S[I] + K[I modulo L]) ( modulo N)
 where N represents the number of elements in S[I] and L is the key 
 length in bytes.
 Swap S[I], S[J]
Example  Assume S = [0, 1, 2, 3] which holds 4 values and each value represented 
by three bits rather than 8 bits for simplicity
Assume encryption K = [1, 5, 2, 4] and apply the scrambling algorithm:
14.3  RC4 Algorithm

Iteration 0 for I=0, J=0
  J = ( 0 + 0  + K( 0  modulo 4) ) modulo 4) = ( 0 + K[0] ) modulo 
4  = ( 0 + 1 ) modulo 4 = 1
  Swap S[0]  with S[1]  result    S= [ 1 , 0, 2 , 3]
Iteration 1    for  I=1, J=1, and   S = [1, 0, 2, 3]
  J= (J+ S[I] + K[I modulo L]) ( modulo 256)
  J= (1 + 0 + K[ 1 modulo 4]  (modulo 4) =  (1 + k[1]) modulo 4 =  
(1 +5 ) modulo 4 = 2
Swap S[1] with S[2]  result S =[ 1, 2,0, 3]
Iteration 2:  for I=2, J=2, and S = [1, 2, 0, 3]
  J = (2 + 2 + K[ 2 Modulo 4]) modulo 4  = (4 + 2)modulo 4 = 2
  Swap S[2],  with  S[2]
Iteration 3:   I=3, J=3   , S=[1,2,0,3],  K = [1, 5, 2, 4]
  J= (J+ S[I] + K[I modulo L]) ( modulo N)   =  (3 + 3+ 0) 
modulo 4= 2
  Swap S[3] with S [2], then the result is S =[1,2,3,0]

Public key cryptography can be used for privacy, authentication, and non-­

	A.	 RSA: RSA was named after three inventors: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and 
Leonard Adleman, and it is a standard for public key cryptography algorithms.
	B.	 Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange: The Diffie–Hellman key exchange enables 
two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure network.
14.7  RSA Algorithm
One of the most useful public key cryptography algorithms is the RSA, which is 
named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman (already 
stated above). RSA is based on number theory and works as follows:
14.7  RSA Algorithm

306
	1.	 Select two prime numbers p and q (prime number is a number divisible by 1 and 
itself only). The larger the number, the harder it is to break the RSA algorithm.
	2.	 Let N = p * q, where N is the product of two prime numbers p and q.
	3.	 Let Z = (p − 1) * (q − 1), where Z is the product of p − 1 and q − 1.
	4.	 Select Kp (public key) such that Kp is less than N and has no common fac­
tors of Z.
	5.	 Find Ks (secret key) such that Ks * Kp − 1 is divisible by Z or Ks = (1 + n * Z)/
Kp; where n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
	6.	 The transmitter uses Kp and N to encrypt message M using Eq. 14.1.
	
	
(14.1)
where:
EM is ciphertext
The transmitter then transmits EM to the receiver.
	7.	 The receiver decrypts EM using Ks and N according to Eq. 14.2.
	
	
(14.2)
Example  Find Ks and Kp assuming p = 3 and q = 5, also encrypt message M = 2 
at the transmitted side then decrypt ciphertext at the receiving side (in this example, 
the prime numbers are selected for ease of understanding).
N = 3 * 5 = 15 and Z = (3 − 1) (5 − 1) = 8
Select a number that is less than N and is not a factor of Z (for this example, 
Kp = 3).
Ks = (1 + n * 8)/3 and n = 4, thus Ks = 11
Transmitter uses Kp to encrypt M = 3
EM = 33 modulo 15 = 12
The transmitter transmits cipher text of 12 to the receiver, then the receiver uses 
the secret key with N to decrypt the ciphertext of value 12.
M = EMKS modulo N
or
M = 1211 modulo 15 = 3

14.9  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is used to implement symmetric key cryptogra­
phy. ECC was invented by Victor Miller of IBM and Neil Koblitz of the University 
of Washington in 1985. The ECC offers a shorter key length with the same security 
provided by RSA, with the following advantages:
•	 Shorter key lengths: ECC uses 128 bits for encryption and 256 bits for digital 
signatures, with RSA needing 3072 bits to provide the same security as ECC.
•	 Very fast key generation: ECC generates symmetric keys faster than RSA.
•	 Faster signature generation: ECC generates digital signatures faster than RSA.
•	 Faster encryption and decryption: ECC implements faster encryption and 
decryption using ECDH than RSA.

	A.	 Finding points on the curve: The are infinite points on an elliptic curve, and in 
order to limit the number of points available, elliptic curve cryptography works 
with a limited field of numbers as shown in Eq. 14.3:
	
	
(14.3)
14  Introduction to Cryptography

309
Example  Find the points on the curve y2 mod 11 = (x3 + x + 3) Mod 11, where in 
the above equation a = 1, b = 3, and P = 11.
By using the equation 4a3 + 27b2 ≠ 0 to verify that y2 = (x3 + x + 3) does not have 
repeated factors, therefore 4 * 13 + 27 * 32 ≠ 0.
14.3

­

14.3
When (x3 + x + 3) mod 11 = Y2 mod 11 = 3, the results are points (0, 5) and (0, 6).
(x3 + x + 3) Mod 11 = Y2 Mod11 = 5 results in the points (1, 4), (1, 7), (4, 4), (4, 
7), (0, 4), and (0, 7).
(x3 + x + 3) Mod 11 = Y2 Mod11 = 0 results in the point (3, 0).
(x3 + x + 3) Mod 11 = Y2 Mod11 = 1 results in the points (7, 1), (7, 10), (10, 10), 
and (10, 1).
(x3 + x + 3) Moe 11 = Y2 Mod11 = 4 results in the points (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 2), 
and (9, 9).
Therefore, the points on the curve are: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 0), (4, 4), 
(4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 10), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 10), (9, 2), (9, 9), (10, 1), (10, 10)
	B.	 Adding points on the elliptic curve: The elliptic curve is symmetrical about the 
x-axis. When given any point P, point −P has to be the point opposite to P.
14.17
P + Q = R,  Q + P = R,  P + P = 2P
If P = P(x, y), then −P = P(x, −y)
P − P = 0.
Finding Point R
Assume points P, Q, and R are represented by P = (xp, yp), Q = (xq, yq), and R = (xr, yr).

Elliptical Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) Key Exchange
With the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, a public key cryptosystem can be devel­
oped. This is known as “ECDH,” or the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman method.
After two parties, Alice and Bob, select common curve parameters (a, b, P) and 
a common point along the curve called G, they can then use the following steps to 
develop a symmetric key.
Alice and Bob select a point on the curve as the generator (G), and they calculate 
the cofactor (h) as follows:
They use the G to find 2G, 3G, 4G, …. nG, where nG reaches infinity.
Example: If Alice and Bob select G(4, 4) and use the table’s addition to find:
2G = G + G = (7, 1), 3G = 2G + G = (1, 4), 4G = 2G +2G = (6, 7), 5G = (6, 4), 
6G = (1, 7), 7G = (7, 10), 8G = (4, 7), and 9G = 8G + G = infinity, then n = 8.
The following represents G,2G………up to 8G
(4, 4), (7, 1), (1, 4), (6, 7), (6, 4), (1, 7), (7, 10), (4, 7)
h = the number of points on the curve / n = 17 / 8 = 2.1
The smaller h shows a good selection of G and results in better security.
The following steps describe the generation of a public key using ECDH:
•	 Alice and Bob select a secret random number between 1 and n. Alice’s secret 
number is N, and Bob’s secret number is M.
•	 Alice calculates the public key (AP) = N * G, and sends it to Bob.
•	 Bob calculates the public key (BP) = M * G, and sends it to Alice.
•	 Alice uses Bob’s public key (BP) to generate the symmetric key (SK): 
SK = N * M *G.
•	 Bob uses Alice’s public key (AP) to generate the symmetric key (SK): 
SK = M * N *G.
Example: Find the secret keys for Alice and Bob, assuming Alice’s random num­
ber N = 3 and Bob’s random number M = 5, with a generator G = (1, 4).
Alice’s public key AP = N * G = 3G = 3 * (10, 10), which is (10, 10) + (10, 
10) + (10, 10). Table x.1 shows that (10, 10) + (10, 10) = (6, 4), and then (6, 4) + (10, 
10) = (0, 5), so AP = (0, 5).
14.1
Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.
Alice uses Bob’s public key to generate their secret key (AS).
Alice’s secret key AS = N * (BP) = 3 * (9, 2) = (0, 6).
Bob’s secret key BS = M * AP = 5 * (0, 5) = (0, 6).
Encryption and Decryption using ECDH
Alice selects a point on the curve which represents their message and encrypts the 
point. Then, the ciphertext is transmitted to Bob.
Assume that Alice’s message is S = (3, 0), Alice uses Eq. 14.4 for the encryp­
tion of S:

(14.5)
S = (1, 7) − 5(0, 5) = (1, 7) − (0, 6) = (1, 7) + (0, −6)
−6 mod 11 = 5
M = (1, 7) + (0, 5) = (3, 0)
14.10  Hash Value or Message Digest
14.18
	1.	 A hash function must be collision resistant which means it is hard to find two 
messages that will generate the same message digest.
	2.	 Changing any bit of message will totally change the message digest.
	3.	 It is impossible to generate the original message from the message digest.
Applications of hash function include hashing passwords and verifying message 
integrity
Hashing Passwords  If a server holds encrypted passwords and a hacker accesses 
the password file and has the encryption key, then the passwords will be open to 
decryption. By hashing the passwords, the attacker will not be able to recover the 
passwords. When a user enters their password, the server will use the hash algo­
rithm and generate the hash value of the password. If the hash value is the same as 
the stored hash value, then the password is correct.
The following are some of the basic hash functions:
 
14.10  Hash Value or Message Digest

314
Frame Check Sequence (FCS) as a Hash Value: Host B generates the FCS of 
the information, encrypts the FCS, and sends it to Host A. If one alters the docu­
ment, the new FCS will differ from the one generated by Host B.
Checksum (generating checksum from a message): Information can be bro­
ken into blocks of characters and arranged in each column, the message $6,578,100 
can be broken into 4 ASCII characters per block as shown below, and the checksum 
of each column can be calculated

If the message changes to $5,578,200, it will generate the same checksum; there­
fore, the checksum method is not a strong message digest. The simplest form of a 
hash function is to break the message into m blocks of n bits as shown below.

Some of the most popular message digests are as follows:
	A.	 MD4: MD4 is a message digest type 4 that generates a 128-bit hash value or 
message digest.
	B.	 MD5: MD5 is an improved version of MD4 that generates a 128-bit hash value
	C.	 SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1): SHA-1 generates a 160-bit hash
	D.	 SHA-256
Data Integrity
14.18

14.18
What happens if another person generates a message and message digest instead 
of Alice and transits it to Bob? How will Bob know if this message is from Alice or 
not? The Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used for authentication of sender 
messages and data integrity.
14.11  Message Authentication Code (MAC)
­
14.19
	1.	 Alice generates a hash value from the message and encrypts it with the shared 
key. This is called the MAC.
	2.	 Alice attaches the MAC to the message and transmits it to Bob.
	3.	 Bob generates the hash value of the message and decrypts the MAC to generate 
a Hash value.
	4.	 If both hashes are equal, there was no message tampering.

Keyed-Hash Message Authentication (HMAC)
14.20
K: Secret key.
N: Size of secret key in bytes.
B: Size of the message in bytes.
K0: If the message is the same size as K (secret key), then K = K0.
IPAD (Inner Pad): IPAD = 0x3636 … the 36 will repeat in order to become the same 
size of secret key, if the secret key (K) is 10 bytes then IPAD = 0x36363636363636363636 
(each byte can be represented by two digits in hex).
OPAD (Outer Pad): OPAD = 0x5C 5C……, the 5C repeated until the size of OPAD 
become the same size as K.
||: Means concatenation, concatenation of 34 and 76 is 3476.
L: Number of bytes generated by Hash.
14  Introduction to Cryptography

317
The following steps describe HAMC generation:
	1.	 Compare the N (number of bytes in secret key) with B (number of bytes in 
message).
	2.	 If they are equal, then K0 = K. Jump to step 4.
	3.	 If N is less than B, then add zeroes to the left of the K in order N = B. Then K=K0.
	4.	 If N is greater than B, then find the Hash value of K (H(K)) which is L bytes, 
then left pad the result with L-B bytes of zeros, resulting in K=B.
	5.	 K0 XOR with IPAD concatenated with message results (K0 XOR IPAD) || 
Message.
IPAD = 0x36 and the 36 repeated in order that Size of IPAD = N.
Hash the result of step 5: H ((K0 XOR IPAD) || Message.
	6.	 OPAD = 0x5C and 5C repeated in order the size of OPAD become N bytes then 
K0 XORed with OPAD K0 XOR OPAD.
	7.	 K0 XOR OPAD concatenated with H((K0 XOR IPAD)|| Message results in 
(K0 XOR OPAD)||H((K0 XOR IPAD)|| Message).
	8.	 The result of step 8 passes through Hash function results H[(K0 XOR 
OPAD)||H((K0 XOR IPAD)|| Message)] which is the HAMC.

	1.	 User A logs into the Kerberos server (KS) and requests to access Server B.
	2.	 The KS prompt the user A for a password, a user ID, and a server ID.
	3.	 KS checks the user’s password and ID and also checks if user A has permission 
to access Server B.
	4.	 If user A passes step 3, then KS creates a ticket that contains a user ID and a 
server ID. KS encrypts the ticket and transmits it to user A and server B. Only 
server B can encrypt the ticket.
14  Introduction to Cryptography

319
 
	5.	 User A sends the ticket to server B; server B encrypts the ticket and compares it 
with the ticket that was sent by KS. If both tickets are the same, then user A is 
allowed to access server B.
Summary
•	 A direct attack is when the attacker breaks the security of a system.
•	 An indirect attack is when the attacker gets information and data (such as a name, 
address, social security, or credit card number).
•	 The elements of network security are confidentiality, authentication, integrity, 
and non-repudiation.
•	 When plaintext is encrypted by an encryption algorithm, it is called a ciphertext.
•	 The algorithm that is used for encryption and decryption is called a cipher.
•	 Cryptography is the science of keeping information secret.
•	 Modern cryptography is classified into two types: symmetric cryptography (pri­
vate key) and asymmetric cryptography (public key).
•	 In symmetric cryptography, the transmitter and the receiver use the same key for 
encryption and decryption.
•	 In asymmetric cryptography (public key), the transmitter and the receiver use 
different keys for encryption and decryption.
•	 The Data Encryption Algorithm is an example of symmetric cryptography.
•	 The elliptic curve equation is y2 = x3 + ax + b.
•	 The RSA algorithm is an example of public key cryptography.
•	 A digital signature is a process that is used by a client to sign an electronic 
document.

Introduction
The transfer of information across networks and the Internet is increasing exponen­
tially due to e-commerce and business transactions. Network security plays an 
important role in successful e-commerce. Currently, many people are accessing 
their bank accounts, buying and selling stocks, and paying bills over the Internet. 
People using these services need to have their transactions be secure. This means 
that the information transmitted should not be able to be accessed or modified by 
anyone other than the authorized user. Network security is implemented to protect 
information in transit and to protect a system from an attack.
15.1  Secure Socket Layer Protocol (SSL)
The Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL) was developed by the Netscape 
Communication Corporation in 1995 for secure communication between a web 
browser and a web server. Version 3 is the latest version of SSL. The IETF modified 
SSL v3 and called it Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is what is typically seen

in use today. However, even when TLS is in use, the term “SSL” tends to be used 
interchangeably. The main difference between TLS and SSL is that TLS uses 
Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), and SSL uses MAC. SSL/
TLS provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and client 
authentication (optional) for both ends.

	A.	 The Handshake Layer consists of Handshake, Change Cipher Specification, and 
Alert Protocols
	B.	 The Record Layer consists of Record Protocol
SSL Handshake Protocol
The SSL handshake protocol performs a series of message exchanges between an 
SSL client and SSL server to authenticate each other and negotiate the encryption 
algorithm established via a secure connection. SSL/TLS can use symmetric cryp­
tography or public key cryptography and is decided based on the cryptography algo­
rithm negotiation.

(a)	 The SSL/TLS version.
	
(b)	 Random Number: This random number, along with a random number and 
a third value referred to as the premaster key, is used to generate a master 
secret key from which the encryption key will be generated.
	
(c)	 Session ID: This is used if the session becomes disconnected, alleviating the 
need for the client and server to perform another handshake.
	
(d)	 Cipher Suites: This is a list of the client’s supported cryptographic algo­
rithms, message digest algorithms, and key exchange algorithms, which 
may be used for SSL handshaking. The list may contain up to 31 cipher suites.
	
(e)	 Compression method: This is optional.

(d)	 Server Certificate: The server provides the client with a digital certificate, 
which establishes the server’s identity, contains the server’s public key, and 
is digitally signed in a chain of trust. Digital certificates will be covered in 
detail in Sect. 15.6.
	
(e)	 Handshake Done.
	 	
15.6
	
(a)	 Premaster Key: Another random number is chosen by the client to be a 
premaster key, which is then encrypted using the public key provided in the 
server’s certificate. Both the client and the server will use this premaster key, 
as well as the other random numbers generated by the client and server, to 
generate a symmetric session key. The server does so by decrypting the pre­
master key that was just sent, which it should only be able to do if it has the 
corresponding private key for the public key provided in the certificate.
	
	
15.7
Record Protocol  The Record Protocol receives the data from the application 
layer or TCP layer and performs following functions:
	(a)	 Fragments the data into blocks or reassembles the data packet.
	(b)	 Adds sequence numbers to each block.
	(c)	 Compresses or decompresses the data packet using the compression algorithm 
negotiated in the handshake protocol.
15.1  Secure Socket Layer Protocol (SSL)

328
 
	(d)	 Encrypts or decrypts the data.
	(e)	 Applies an HMAC (or a MAC for SSL 3.0) to outgoing data.
	(f)	 Computes the HMAC and verifies that it is identical to the value transmitted. 
This check ensures data integrity when a message is received.
Alert Protocol  The Alert Protocol is used to notify both client and server about 
errors and session termination.
15.2  Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Large organizations and corporations have multiple sites in different locations and 
would often like to connect LANs together. One solution is to lease a data commu­
nication line and connect the LANs together thus creating a private network. A 
corporation with 100 offices in different locations throughout a country must lease 
100 lines to connect its LANs together. This method is not cost-effective. In order 
to reduce the cost of leasing private lines, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be 
employed over Internet.

authentication method.
	3.	 Layer-2 Tunneling Protocol (L2FT): L2FT was developed by CISCO and 
IETF. It is a combination of L2F and Point-to-Point Tunnel Protocol
	4.	 IP security (IPsec) Protocol: The IP Security Protocol was developed by IETF.
15.3  IP Security Protocol (IPsec)
In order to protect information traveling via VPNs from attack, the IETF developed 
the IPsec protocol for integrity, authentication, and confidentiality of data over IP 
networks. The IPsec Protocol is an open standard and does not define any specific 
protocol for authentication and encryption. The IP Security Protocol is becoming 
increasingly more popular than the other protocols. IPsec is made of two protocols 
Authentication 
Header 
Protocol 
(AH) 
and 
Encapsulation 
Security 
Protocol (ESP).
Authentication Header Protocol
15.9
The following describes the function of each field of authentication header:
•	 Next Header: Identifies the next header (such as TCP).
•	 Payload Length: Number of 32-bit words in AH.
15.3  IP Security Protocol (IPsec)

330
 
•	 Security Parameter Index (SPI): The SPI informs the receiving station of the 
location of the security information such as the decryption key.
•	 Sequence Number: Every packet has a unique number. If an intruder copies a 
packet and resends it with the same sequence number, then the receiver discards 
the packet.
•	 Authentication Data: This is digital signature of the payload.

15.4  Secure Shell (SSH)
SSH was developed in 1995 and is widely used in many Unix systems to overcome 
the weaknesses of Telnet and FTP. The SSH standards were developed by the IETF 
and then the Secure Shell was commercialized in 1998 by www.ssh.com where it 
was implemented for the Windows and UNIX systems. SSH version one (SSH1) 
had numerous weaknesses, but SSH2 overcame these. SSH2 is open source, and it 
can be found at the following websites:

332
 
	1.	 www.openssh.com
	2.	 http://www.freesshd.com/
	3.	 www.filezilla.com
Telnet is used for remote logging and FTP is used for file transfer from a remote 
computer. These protocols have the following weaknesses.
	1.	 Telnet and FTP use passwords as an authentication method. When transmitted 
for authentication, these passwords are transmitted in plaintext.
	2.	 Telnet and FTP transmit all data in plaintext, which does not provide protection 
from attacks that monitor data that can read plaintext.
	3.	 Telnet and FTP clients do not authenticate the server.
Advantages of SSH Secure Shell  SSH offers logging into a remote device securely 
with the following features:
	1.	 SSH transmits data in cipher text.
	2.	 SSH transmits user authentication information in cipher text.
	3.	 SSH clients authenticate the server.
	4.	 SSH dynamically generates a key exchange between the client and the server for 
encryption and decryption between the server and the client.
SSH Protocol
15.15
SSH User Authentication Protocol (SSH-AUTH)  This verifies the client’s iden­
tity by using the provided public key or password.
SSH Connection Protocol (SSH-CONNECT)  The SSH connections provide 
multiple channels, and these channels are multiplexed to one encrypted tunnel.
SSH Transport Protocol (SSH-TRANS)  SSH-TRANS runs on top of TCP with 
the port number 22. It makes a secure connection between a client and a server by 
providing Integrity and Confidentiality
SSH-TRANS performs the following operations:
15  Network Security

333
 
	1.	 The server and the client negotiate the SSH version and software to be used.
	2.	 Another negotiation takes place to determine the algorithm for encryption and 
the MAC algorithm for integrity. Some of the used encryption algorithms are 
AES128-CBC, AES256-CBC, AES-CTR, and Blowfish-CBC.  Some of the 
algorithms for Message Authentic Code (MAC) are HMAC-MD5, HMAC-­
SHA-­256, and HMAC-SHA-512.
	3.	 Key exchanges such Diffie–Hellman. The client and the server share a secret key 
and use the secret key to generate encryption and authentication keys.
15.16
15.5  IEEE 802.1X
Security is one of the most important issues in the development of Wireless LAN. In 
a wired LAN, users have a direct connection to the network, whereas WLAN users 
do not. WLAN users must verify their identity before accessing the network. 
Authentication is a process used by a wireless station or a wired station to identify 
oneself on the network. A password is used for authentication when accessing a 
network’s resources.
Typically, the communication channel between a user and a WLAN is not secure. 
An attacker can monitor the communication channel and collect user data and 
15.5  IEEE 802.1X

334
 
passwords. The network administrator operates the access point (where a user 
accesses the network), but a hacker may set up a rogue access point to capture the 
connection of an unsuspecting client. Therefore, a method is needed such that the 
user can verify the authenticity of the access point. This method of authentication is 
called Mutual Authentication.
15.17
Supplicant  A supplicant can be any device using IEEE 802.11 protocol for net­
working, or any PC connected to the network.
Authenticator  The authenticator can be an access point for 802.11 LAN or a 
switch for a wired LAN. The authenticator uses controlled and uncontrolled ports 
for authentication of a supplicant.
Authentication Server  The authentication server performs an authentication pro­
cess for a supplicant. One type of authentication server is called a RADIUS (Remote 
Authentication Dial-In User Service). A RADIUS is both an authentication server 
and an accounting server and is used to authorize a station on the network.
Authentication Protocol  An authentication protocol is a procedure that is used by 
the client and the authentication server for the authentication process. IEEE 802.1x 
uses EAP for exchanging messages during the authentication process. EAP sup­
ports the following authentication messages between client and server:
	(a)	 Request
	(b)	 Response
	(c)	 Success
	(d)	 Failure
EAP messages between the client and the AP are carried by the EAPOL (EAP 
over LAN) protocol. EAP messages from the AP to the server are carried by the 
EAP over RADIUS protocol.
15  Network Security

335
IEEE 802.1X does not define which authentication protocol to use. There are 40 
authentication protocols available, and some of the most popular are as follows:
	1.	 EAP-MD5 (Message Digest 5): EAP-MD5 is a password-based authentication 
protocol.
	2.	 EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security): EAP-TLS is based on mutual 
authentication of the client to the server and the server to the client. Both the cli­
ent and the server must be assigned a digital certificate.
	3.	 LEAP (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol): Used by CISCO.
	4.	 EAP-TTLS (Tunneled TLS).
	5.	 PEAP (Protected EAP).
802.1X Operation
The authenticator (i.e., access point) contains both the logical controlled and uncon­
trolled ports for authentication. When using the uncontrolled logical ports, the client 
can communicate with the authentication server but does not have access to the 
network services. The following steps describe the authentication process of a client 
by an authentication server.
	1.	 The client requests an association with the AP (access point).
	2.	 The AP responds to the client’s request.
	3.	 The client sends an EAP start message to the AP.
	4.	 The AP requests the identity of the client (such as the user name).
	5.	 The client sends an EAP packet containing their identity to the authentica­
tion server.
	6.	 The authentication server identifies the client.
	7.	 The authentication server can accept or reject the client request.
	8.	 Upon accepting the client’s request, the AP sends an EAP success packet to the 
client and authorizes the controlled port so that the client can access the network 
services.
15.6  Certificates
15.18
­
Certificates verify the identity of a server, a program, or personal identification 
information such as a pictured driver license and number. A driver license is issued

by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Digital certificates are issued in a similar 
fashion by the Certificate Authority (CA). Some of the certification authorities are 
the US Postal Service, Commercenet, and Versign.
A digital certificate contains a public key, the full name of the certificate holder, 
the name of the certification authority, and a digital signature of the CA. All certifi­
cates use X.509 Standard, which has been recommended by the ITU. The X.509 
standard defines the information in a certificate. This information is usually divided 
into two sections: the data section and signature section.
The data section of X.509 contains the following information:
•	 Version Number: This number identifies the X.509 version such as V1, 
V2 and V3.
•	 Certificate Serial Number: This number is assigned to a certificate by the CA.
•	 Signature Algorithm: The type of algorithm that is used for the signature of a 
certificate.
•	 Name of the Certificate Authority.
•	 Duration of the Certificate: The period in which a certificate is valid.
•	 Public Key Algorithm: The algorithm that is used to generate a public key.
The signature section contains the following information:
•	 The cryptographic algorithm used by the CA to create its digital signatures.
•	 The digital signature of all data in the certificates.
For a user to check the validity of a certificate, he or she must perform the fol­
lowing functions:
	1.	 Check the expiration date.
	2.	 Check if the certified authority name is on the trusted list.
	3.	 Find the digital certificates of all data and compare against those attached to the 
certificates.

15.7  Firewalls
15.20
­
­
	(a)	 Packet Filtering Firewall
	(b)	 Application Proxy Server or Network Address Translation Firewall
	(c)	 Stateful Firewall
Packet Filtering  A firewall can examine each incoming packet’s header such as 
the IP header, TCP, or UDP header, and, based on security criteria set by the net­
work administration, accept or reject any packet. These criteria are as follows:
	A.	 Source IP Address and Destination IP Address: A firewall can be programmed 
to block packets based on the IP address of the packet. This task is done at the 
Network Level of the TCP/IP model.
	B.	 Protocol Type: The firewall can block packets based on protocols such as TCP, 
UDP, and ICMP protocols. For example, protocol filtering can filter any packet 
15.7  Firewalls

338
 
intended for ICMP. Protocol filtering is done at the Network Level of the TCP/
IP model.
	C.	 Source Port and Destination Port Filtering: The firewall can block packets 
based on the port number of the incoming packets. The port number is used to 
define application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and TFTP. For exam­
ple, a firewall may block any incoming mail by blocking SMTP or port 25. Port 
filtering is done at the transport level of the TCP/IP model.
	D.	 Packet Payload (information on the payload): A firewall can block packets 
based on the information contained in a packet’s payloads such as a packet con­
taining a “dirty word” or a specific sentence. The information filtering is done at 
the application level of TCP/IP model.
Application Proxy Server or Network Address Translation (NAT)  The proxy 
server application is located between the trusted network and the un-trusted net­
work. Assume a client of the private network wants to access the un-trusted network 
such as Internet. First, it sends a request to the proxy server and the proxy server 
uses its IP address to send the request, on the behalf of client, to the destination 
server. Therefore, destination server sees only the proxy server’s IP address. The IP 
addresses of the clients in the private network are not exposed to the Internet. A 
proxy server should contain a software module for each application protocol such as 
HTTP, Telnet SMTP, and TFTP.
Stateful Firewall  A Stateful Firewall keeps track of its connections and deter­
mines if the incoming packets belong to the current connections or not. This type of 
firewall can be configured such that it will deny any connection from the un-trusted 
network to the trusted server. The un-trusted network can only send packets to the 
trusted server if the trusted server requests them; otherwise, the un-requested pack­
ets will be discarded by the firewall.

15.8  WLAN Security
A WLAN is less secure than a wired LAN. In a wired LAN, any person who wants 
access to the network must make a physical connection. In WLANs, users can 
access an AP if the AP signal is detectable. The following methods are used for the 
security of WLANs:
	(a)	 Service Set Identifier
	(b)	 MAC Address Filtering
	(c)	 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
	(d)	 Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2 and WPA3
	(e)	 Authentication
Packet Sniffer
A packet sniffer is a piece of software that captures packets coming into and going 
out of a network. It is used for network monitoring or analysis. A packet sniffer 
captures all the data that passes through a network and is set to capture packets for 
a specific machine.

15.8  WLAN Security

340
 
The IEEE 802.11 standard defines two types of authentications: Open System 
Authentication and Shared Key Authentication.
Opens System Authentication
This is the simplest method of authentication for a WLAN as the access point and 
the client set their own criteria for authentication. If a client has the SSID of the 
access point, the client sends an authentication frame with its secret key to the 
access point. If the secret key of the client matches the secret key of the access point, 
then the AP sends a positive response to the client and the client becomes associated 
with the AP.

15.9  IEEE 802.11i
The IEEE802.11i-2004 amendment consisted of two sets of security protocols 
which are as follows:
	(a)	 A set of protocols to overcome the weakness of WEP. It was certified by the 
Wi-Fi Alliance and called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
	(b)	 A second set of security protocols called the robust security network (RSN). 
RSN was also certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and called WPA2.
15.9.1  WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
WPA is a subset of IEEE 802.11i and was developed to overcome the weakness of 
WEP by adding TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), IEEE802.1X, Extensible 
Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the RADIUS Server. TKIP enhanced WEP by 
adding the following features:
	1.	 Initialization vector (IV)
	
(a)	 IV size changed from 24 bits to 48 bits.
	
(b)	 IV created from a number sequence to avoid replay attacks.
	2.	 For each packet a new IV is used.
	3.	 Key management.
15.9  IEEE 802.11i

342
	4.	 Use of the RC4 algorithm for encryption.
	5.	 WPA uses a Message Integrity Code known as Michael. The key management 
and authentication protocols used by WPA and WPA2 are the same. The only 
difference is that WPA uses the RC4 algorithm for encryption with Michael as a 
Message Integrity Code, while WPA2 uses AES–CCMP for encryption and mes­
sage integrity.
15.9.2  Wi-Fi Protected Access-2 (WPA2)
WPA2 operates in two modes, WPA2 Pre-shared Key (WPA2-PSK) and WPA2 
Enterprise.
WPA2 Enterprise mode uses RADIUS Server and EAP for authentication. The 
user provides authentication information and is authenticated by an authentica­
tion server (RADIUS). Larger networks use WPA2 Enterprise mode.
WPA2 Personal mode (WPA2-PSK) provides a simple authentication method 
called pre-shared key for authentication and does not require a specific authenti­
cation server.
IEE802.11i ratified the Robust Security Network (RSN) for Wireless LANs. 
RSN includes the following:
	1.	 IEEE 802.1x Authentication.
	2.	 Extensile Authentication Protocol (EAP).
	3.	 WPA2 Enterprise uses the AES algorithm with Counter Mode (CTR) for encryp­
tion and combines CTR with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication 
Code to generate the MAC. This is called AES-CCMP for encryption and mes­
sage integrity.
	4.	 Supports multiple Authentication Protocols.

WPA and WPA2 Key management
IEEE 802.11i defines a Pairwise Key for unicast transmission and a Group Key for 
multicast and broadcast transmission:
Pairwise Master Key (PMK): This key can be generated by a server-based key 
generator and transmitted to an AP and a client during an authentication operation, 
or as a pre-shared key.
Temporal keys consist of the following 128-bit keys:
15  Network Security

343
 
 
 
	A.	 Data Encryption Key: This key is used for encryption.
	B.	 Data Integrity Key: This key is used to generate a Message Integrity 
Code (MIC).
	C.	 EAPOL-Key Encryption Key: This key is used for the Extensible Authentication 
Protocol over LAN for the authentication of a client.
	D.	 EAPOL-Key Integrity Key: Used by the EAPOL protocol to check integrity.
15.26
15.9  IEEE 802.11i

344
MAC1 and MAC2 are the MAC addresses for a client and access point.
Nonce1 and Nonce2 are random numbers which are used only once.
ASE-CCMP uses the same key for encryption and message integrity, and the 
PTK for WPA2 utilizes 3 keys instead of 4.
15.9.3  WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access-3)
WPA3 is the latest generation of wireless network security based on IEEE802.11s. 
WPA3 improves the level of security used by WPA2 standard. WPA3 offers two 
modes of operation, WPA3 Personal (WPA-3 SAE) and WPA3-Enterprise
