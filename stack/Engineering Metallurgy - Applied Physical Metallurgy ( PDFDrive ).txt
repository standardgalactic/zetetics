PREFACE
To the First Edition
This text-book constitutes Part I of 'Engineering Metallurgy' and is
intended primarily for students taking metallurgy as an examination sub-
ject for a Higher National Certificate in Mechanical or Production Engin-
eering. The author hopes that it may also prove useful to undergraduates
studying metallurgy as an ancillary subject in an Engineering Degree
course. To students for whom metallurgy is a principal subject the book
can offer a helpful approach to certain sections of the work in preparation
for the Higher National Certificate and the City and Guilds Final Certifi-
cates in Metallurgy.
Comprehensive tables covering most of the alloys of importance to
engineers are given in the appropriate chapters. In these tables an attempt
has been made to relate British Standard Specifications to many commer-
cially produced alloys. The author hopes that these tables will remain of
use when the reader, no longer a student, finds it necessary to choose
alloys for specific engineering purposes.
A generation ago much of a student's time was spent in dealing with the
principles of extraction metallurgy. The widened scope of applied physical
metallurgy has, however, in recent years, established prior claims upon
the time available. Hence the brief survey in Chapter 2 of the production
of iron and steel has to serve as a sufficient introduction to the methods
of extraction metallurgy in general.
In the main, then, this book deals with the microstructural and mechan-
ical properties of metals and alloys. Processes such as heat-treatment,
surface hardening and welding are dealt with from the theoretical as well
as the practical aspect. The author trusts that the treatment in Chapter 1
of the basic principles of chemistry will enable readers to follow the study
of engineering metallurgy without being at a disadvantage if they have not
previously studied chemistry as an independent subject.
It has been considered desirable to provide a basis for practical metal-
lography; hence details of laboratory techniques are dealt with in
Chapter 10.
At the end of each chapter will be found a selection of questions and

exercises. Many of these have been taken from Higher National Certificate
examination papers, and the author is greatly indebted to those authorities
who have given permission for such questions to be used.
Although 'Engineering Metallurgy' Part II (Metallurgical Process Tech-
nology) is strictly speaking a sequel to the present volume, it may on
occasion be read with advantage as a companion book—particularly when
the approved syllabus for the Engineering Higher National Certificate is
more than usually ambitious, or when direct contacts of students with
metallurgical processes are limited by local circumstances.
In both Parts sections are numbered on the decimal system. In Part II
frequent references to appropriate sections of Part I make it easy for the
reader to look up the metallurgical principles governing any particular
process under study.
Except where otherwise stated, the photomicrographs in this book are
the work of the author or his students.
The author wishes to record his thanks to his wife for considerable help
in producing the line diagrams; and to his friends J. H. Parry, Esq., FIM,
of the School of Technology, Ipswich, and A. N. Wyers, Esq., AIM, of
the Chance Technical College, for reading the original MS and making
many helpful suggestions. He also wishes to record his appreciation of the
generous assistance given to him at all stages in the production of this book
by W. E. Fisher, Esq., OBE, DSc.
The author wishes to acknowledge the considerable help given by those
connected with various industrial organisations, but in particular W. E.

field); J. F. Hinsley, Esq. (Messrs. Edgar Allen and Co. Ltd., Sheffield);

PREFACE
To the Sixth Edition
In 1937 I was a fledgling graduate with slim expectations of making a
decent living as a scientist in British industry. The most exciting job the
University Appointments Board was able to suggest for me involved the
routine testing of aircraft carburettors on a twelve-hour shift basis (days
and nights turn about) for the princely pittance of two guineas (£2.10)
per week. Not unnaturally I spurned the offer and my name was summarily
expunged from the files of the Appointments Board lest my 'unhelpful
attitude' upset the delicate susceptibilities of their 'important clients' were
I to be let loose near them.
There followed a dismal period when I eked out a precarious existence
by twanging a Hawaiian steel guitar in a hula-hula band, performing in
some of the more malodorous fleapits which served as variety theatres in
those days of the nineteen-thirties. My lingering memory of that period of
my life is not of the alleged glamour of showbiz but of the acrid smell of
soft soap trapped in the wide cracks between the floorboards of the grubby
little dressing rooms.
As war clouds gathered late in 1938 and the more enlightened sections of
the metals industry anticipated the future need of scientists, I was offered a
job at the then quite reasonable weekly wage of £3.10s (£3.50). This I
grabbed with alacrity—after all it was a wage equal to that of a general
shop-floor worker and slightly more than half that paid to the semi-skilled
brass casters who were placed under my care, so who was I to grumble?
It will come as no surprise to the reader to learn that as soon as was
possible I quit British industry for ever and sought employment in technical
education, an occupation which for the next thirty-five years provided
intellectual freedom, a decent standard of life, time to become a mountain-
eer—and to write text books.
During the days which have followed the Second World War the func-
tions of the scientist and engineer in industry have reputedly become
increasingly important. But has status and remuneration improved pro-
portionally? I suspect not. An examination of recent job advertisements
leads me to believe that, allowing for some fifty years of inflation coupled

with a higher proportion of salary lost to taxation as compared with pre-war
days, real remuneration has changed little for the young graduate. Only
the jargon of the advertisement is different. Now, instead of 'qualifications
and experience', your 4CV is required and the salary is quoted in £K—
meant to impress I suppose. One advertisement I noticed recently pre-
ferred a 'Chartered Engineer or equivalent'. What, I wondered, would
be regarded as an 'equivalent'? Applicants were asked to write to the
'Human Resources Department' which suggested to me that a prospective
employee would be equated with so many tons of coal or some other
expendable commodity. What's wrong with the old title 'Personnel Office'
for God's sake? One wonders whether such an organisation has recruited
Monty Python as its managing director.
It is now almost forty years since the late Dr W. E. Fisher, OBE, bullied
me into producing the manuscript which became the First Edition of this
book. Then in his late seventies and the dynamic Technical Editor of the
then English Universities Press, he remains a great inspiration to me now
that I in turn find myself at a similar age. Originally the book was written
as a text for those student engineers taking metallurgy as a subject in
the Higher National Certificate (Engineering) Courses. At the temporary
demise of the Higher National Certificate some ten years ago this volume
was largely rewritten to provide a treatment of general physical metallurgy
at the elementary and intermediate levels.
When some years previously, 'metallurgy' had been replaced by
'materials science' in engineering syllabuses, many authors—attempting
an adroit vault on to the bandwaggon—added a hurried chapter on 'plas-
tics' to their existing texts. In many cases this served only to display a
rather nebulous understanding of the true nature of the covalent bond. No
mention was made of other non-metallic engineering materials. Obviously
in almost forty years many new sophisticated metallic alloys have been
developed whilst other metals, hitherto known only as symbols in the
Periodic Classification of the Elements, have been drawn into the technol-
ogy of the late twentieth century. Thus lithium, scandium, gallium, yttrium,
indium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodynium, samarium, gadolinium,
dysprosium, erbium, thulium and ytterbium have all found uses during
recent years in commercial alloys. They join boron, titanium, germanium,
zirconium, niobium, cerium, hafnium and tantalum which had become
metallurgically valuable during the immediately previous decades. Conse-
quently this book has grown over the years so that it contains some 40%
more pages than the first edition. Nevertheless it is still confined to a study
of metallurgy and those who wish to study materials science for HNC or
on a more general level should consult other titles.

Dedicated to My Wife, Helen,
Who helped with the First Edition almost forty years ago—
and who still provides cups of tea whilst I scribble.
'The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the
vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the
furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears and his
eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his
mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly . . .'

Some Fundamental
Chemistry
1.10 Towards the end of the fifteenth century the technology of shipbuild-
ing was sufficiently advanced in Europe to allow Columbus to sail west
into the unknown in a search for a new route to distant Cathay. Earlier
that century far to the east in Samarkand in the empire of Tamerlane,
the astronomer Ulug Beg was constructing his great sextant—the massive
quadrant of which we can still see to-day—to measure the period of our
terrestrial year. He succeeded in this enterprise with an error of only 58
seconds, a fact which the locals will tell you with pride. Yet at that time
only seven metals were known to man—copper, silver, gold, mercury,
iron, tin and lead; though some of them had been mixed to produce alloys
like bronze (copper and tin), pewter (tin and lead) and steel (iron and
carbon).
By 1800 the number of known metals had risen to 23 and by the begin-
ning of the twentieth century to 65. Now, all 70 naturally occurring metallic
elements are known to science and an extra dozen or so have been created
by man from the naturally occurring radioactive elements by various pro-
cesses of 'nuclear engineering'. Nevertheless metallurgy, though a modern
science, has its roots in the ancient crafts of smelting, shaping and treat-
ment of metals. For several hundreds of years smiths had been hardening
steel using heat-treatment processes established painstakingly by trial and
error, yet it is only during this century that metallurgists discovered how
the hardening process worked. Likewise during the First World War the
author's father, then in the Royal Flying Corps, was working with fighter
aeroplanes the engines of which relied on 'age-hardening' aluminium
alloys; but it was quite late in the author's life before a plausible expla-
nation of age-hardening was forthcoming.
Since the days of the Great Victorians there has been an upsurge in
metallurgical research and development, based on the fundamental
sciences of physics and chemistry. To-day a vast reservoir of metallurgical

knowledge exists and the metallurgist is able to design materials to meet
the ever exacting demands of the engineer. Sometimes these demands are
over optimistic and it is hoped that this book may help the engineer to
appreciate the limitations, as well as the expanding range of properties, of
modern alloys.
1.11 Whilst steel is likely to remain the most important metallurgical
material available to the engineer we must not forget the wide range of
relatively sophisticated alloys which have been developed during this cen-
tury. As a result of such development an almost bewildering list of alloy
compositions confronts the engineer in his search for an alloy which will
be both technically and economically suitable for his needs. Fortunately
most of the useful alloys have been classified and rigid specifications laid
down for them by such official bodies as the British Standards Institution
(BSI) and in the USA, the American Society for Testing Materials
(ASTM). Now that we are in Europe' such bodies as Association Frangaise
de Normalisation (AFNOR) and Deutscher Normenausschuss (DNA) also
become increasingly involved.
Sadly, it may be that like many of our public libraries here in the Midlands,
your local library contains proportionally fewer books on technological mat-
ters than it did fifty years ago, and that meagre funds have been expended
on works dealing with the private life of Gazza—or the purple passion publi-
cations of Mills and Boon. Nevertheless at least one library in your region
should contain, by national agreement, a complete set of British Standards
Institution Specifications. In addition to their obvious use, these are a valu-
able mine of information on the compositions and properties of all of our
commercial alloys and engineering materials. A catalogue of all Specifi-
cation Numbers will be available at the information desk. Hence, forearmed
with the necessary metallurgical knowledge, the engineer is able to select an
alloy suitable to his needs and to quote its relevant specification index when
the time comes to convert design into reality.
Atoms, Elements and Compounds
1.20 It would be difficult to study metallurgy meaningfully without relat-
ing mechanical properties to the elementary forces acting between the
atoms of which a metal is composed. We shall study the structures of atoms
later in the chapter but it suffices at this stage to regard these atoms as tiny
spheres held close to one another by forces of attraction.
1.21 If in a substance all of these atoms are of the same type then the
substance is a chemical element. Thus the salient property of a chemical
element is that it cannot be split up into simpler substances whether by
mechanical or chemical means. Most of the elements are chemically reac-
tive, so that we find very few of them in their elemental state in the Earth's
crust—oxygen and nitrogen mixed together in the atmosphere are the most
common, whilst a few metals such as copper, gold and silver, also occur
uncombined. Typical substances occurring naturally contain atoms of two
or more kinds.

1.22 Most of the substances we encounter are either chemical com-
pounds or mixtures. The difference between the two is that a compound
is formed when there is a chemical join at the surfaces of two or more
different atoms, whilst in a mixture only mechanical 'entangling' occurs
between discrete particles of the two substances. For example, the pow-
dered element sulphur can be mixed with iron filings and easily separated
again by means of a magnet, but if the mixture is gently heated a vigorous
chemical reaction proceeds and a compound called iron sulphide is formed.
This is different in appearance from either of the parent elements and its
decomposition into the parent elements, sulphur and iron, is now more
difficult and can be accomplished only be chemical means.
1.23 Chemical elements can be represented by a symbol which is usu-
ally an abbreviation of either the English or Latin name, eg O stands
for oxygen whilst Fe stands for 'ferrum', the Latin equivalent of iron'.
Ordinarily, a symbol written thus refers to a single atom of the element,
whilst two atoms (constituting what in this instance we call a molecule)
would be indicated so: O2.
1.24 Table 1.1 includes some of the more important elements we are
likely to encounter in a study of metallurgy. The term 'relative atomic
mass', (formerly 'atomic weight'), mentioned in this table must not be con-
fused with the relative density of the element. The latter value will depend
upon how closely the atoms, whether small or large, are packed together.
Since atoms are very small particles (the mass of the hydrogen atom is
1.673 x 10~27 kg), it would be inconvenient to use such small values in
everyday chemical calculations. Consequently, since the hydrogen atom
was known to be the smallest, its relative mass was taken as unity and the
relative masses of the atoms of other elements calculated as multiples of
this. Thus relative atomic mass became
mass of one atom of the element
mass of one atom of hydrogen
Later it was found more useful to adjust the relative atomic mass of oxygen
(by far the most common element) to exactly 16.0000. On this basis the
relative atomic mass of hydrogen became 1.008 instead of 1.0000. More
recently chemists and physicists have agreed to relate atomic masses to
that of the carbon isotope (C = 12.0000). (See paragraph 1.90.)
1.25 The most common metallic element in the Earth's crust is alu-
minium (Table 1.2) but as a commercially usable metal it is not the cheap-
est. This is because clay, the most abundant mineral containing aluminium,
is very difficult—and therefore costly—to decompose chemically. There-
fore our aluminium supply comes from the mineral bauxite (originally
mined near the village of Les Baux, in France), which is a relatively scarce
ore. It will be seen from the table that apart from iron most of the useful
metallic elements account for only a very small proportion of the Earth's
crust. Fortunately they occur in relatively concentrated deposits which
makes their mining and extraction economically possible.
In passing it is interesting to note that in the Universe as a whole hydro-

gen is by far the most common element. In fact it accounts for some 90%

10%; all other elements being restricted to no more than 0.2% in total.
Magnesium, at about 0.003% is possibly the most abundant metal in the
Universe. We are indeed fortunate in the variety and abundance of chemi-
cal elements on Earth.
Chemical Reactions and Equations
1.30 Readers will be familiar with the behaviour of the chemical sub-
stances we call salts during electrolysis. The metallic particles (or ions as
they are termed) being positively charged are attracted to the negative

electrode (or cathode), whilst the non-metallic ions being negatively
charged are attracted to the positive electrode (or anode). Because of the
behaviour of their respective ions metals are said to be electropositive and
non-metals electronegative.
In general elements react or combine with each other when they possess
opposite chemical natures. Thus the more electropositive a metal the more
readily will it combine with a non-metal, forming a very stable compound.
If one metal is more strongly electropositive than another the two may
combine forming what is called an intermetallic compound, though usually
they only mix with each other forming what is in effect a 'solid solution'.
This constitutes the basis of most useful alloys.
1.31 Atoms combine with each other in simple fixed proportions. For
example, one atom of the gas chlorine (Cl) will combine with one atom of
the gas hydrogen (H) to form one molecule of the gas hydrogen chloride.
We can write down a formula for hydrogen chloride which expresses at a
glance its molecular constitution, viz. HCl. Since one atom of chlorine will
combine with one atom of hydrogen, its valence is said to be one, the term
valence denoting the number of atoms of hydrogen which will combine
with one atom of the element in question. Again, two atoms of hydrogen
combine with one atom of oxygen to form one molecule of water (H2O),
so that the valence of oxygen is two. Similarly, four atoms of hydrogen
will combine with one atom of carbon to form one molecule of methane
(CH4). Hence the valence of carbon in this instance is four. However,
carbon, like several other elements, exhibits a variable valence, since it will
also form the substances ethene (C2H4), formerly 'ethylene', and ethine
(C2H2), formerly acetylene.
1.32 Compounds also react with each other in simple proportions, and
we can express such a reaction in the form of a chemical equation thus:
CaO + 2HCl = CaCl2 + H2O

The above equation tells us that one chemical unit of calcium oxide (CaO
or 'quicklime') will react with two chemical units of hydrogen chloride
(HCl or hydrochloric acid), to produce one chemical unit of calcium chlor-
ide (CaCb) and one chemical unit of water (H2O). Though the total
number of chemical units may change due to the reaction—we began with
three units and ended with two—the total number of atoms remains the
same on either side of the equation. The equation must balance rather like
a financial balance sheet.
1.33 By substituting the appropriate atomic masses (approximated
values from Table 1.1) in the above equation we can obtain further useful
information from it.
Thus, 56 parts by weight of quicklime will react with 73 parts by weight of
hydrogen chloride to produce 111 parts by weight of calcium chloride and
18 parts by weight of water. Naturally, instead of 'parts by weight' we can
use grams, kilograms or tonnes as required.
We will now deal with some chemical reactions relevant to a study of
metallurgy.
Oxidation and Reduction
1.40 Oxidation is one of the most common of chemical processes. It
refers, in its simplest terms, to the combination between oxygen and any
other element—a phenomenon which is taking place all the time around
us. In our daily lives we make constant use of oxidation. We inhale
atmospheric oxygen and reject carbon dioxide (CO2)—the oxygen we
breathe combines with carbon from our animal tissues, releasing energy in
the process. We then reject the waste carbon dioxide. Similarly, heat
energy can be produced by burning carbonaceous materials, such as coal
or petroleum. Just as without breathing oxygen animals cannot live, so
without an adequate air supply fuel cannot burn. In these reactions carbon
and oxygen have combined to form a gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), and at
the same time heat energy has been released—the 'energy potential' of
the carbon having fallen in the process.
1.41 Oxidation, however, is also a phenomenon which works to our
disadvantage, particularly in so far as the metallurgist is concerned, since
a large number of otherwise useful metals show a great affinity for oxygen
and combine with it whenever they are able. This is particularly so at high
temperatures so that the protection of metal surfaces by means of fluxes
is often necessary during melting and welding operations. Although cor-
rosion is generally a more complex phenomenon, oxidation is always

involved and expensive processes such as painting, plating or galvanising
must be used to protect the metallic surface.
1.42 It should be noted that, to the chemist, the term oxidation has a
much wider meaning, and in fact refers to a chemical process in which the
electronegative (or non-metallic) constituent of the molecule is increased.
(1.74) For example, iron (II) chloride may be oxidised to iron (III)
chloride—
2FeCl2 + Cl2 = 2FeCl3
Iron(II) 
Iron(III)
chloride 
chloride
The element oxygen is not involved in this reaction, yet we say that iron
(II) chloride has been 'oxidised' by chlorine since the chlorine ion is
electronegative and so the electronegative portion of the iron (III) chlor-
ide molecule is greater than that of the iron (II) chloride molecule.
Since iron exhibits valences of both two and three this is indicated, in
current chemical nomenclature, by writing either iron (II)' or 'iron (III)'
as appropriate. Formerly the terms 'ferrous' or 'ferric' were used to
describe these two series of compounds. In fact any metal exhibiting a
variable valence gave rise to '-ous' and '-/c' series of compounds; -ous
being used to describe that series in which the metal exhibits the lower
valence and -ic that in which the metal exhibits the higher valence.
1.43 Whilst many metals exist in the Earth's crust in combination with
oxygen as oxides, others are combined with sulphur as sulphides. The latter
form the basis of many of the non-ferrous (that is, containing no iron)
metal ores. The separation and removal of the oxygen or sulphur contained
in the ore from the metal itself is often a difficult and expensive process.
Most of the sulphide ores are first heated in air to convert them to oxides,
eg—
2ZnS 
+ 3O2 = 2ZnO + 
2SO2
Zinc sulphide 
Zinc oxide 
Sulphur
('zinc blende') 
dioxide (gas)
The oxide, whether occurring naturally or produced as indicated in the
above equation, is then generally mixed with carbon in the form of coke
or anthracite and heated in a furnace. In most cases some of the carbon is
burned simultaneously in order to provide the necessary heat which will
cause the reaction to proceed more quickly. Under these conditions carbon
usually proves to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does the metal
and so takes oxygen away from the metal, forming carbon dioxide and
leaving the metal (often impure) behind, eg—
2ZnO-HC = 2Zn+ CO2
This process of separating the atoms of oxygen from a substance is known
as reduction. Reduction is thus the reverse of oxidation, and again, in the

wider chemical sense, it refers to a reaction in which the proportion of the
electronegative constituent of the molecule is decreased.
1.44 Some elements have greater affinities for oxygen than have others.
Their oxides are therefore more difficult to decompose. Aluminium and
magnesium, strongly electropositive metals, have greater affinities for oxy-
gen than has carbon, so that it is impossible to reduce their oxides in the
normal way using coke—electrolysis, a much more expensive process,
must be used. Metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, zinc, iron and lead,
which form stable, tenacious oxides are usually called base metals, whilst
those metals which have little affinity for oxygen are called noble metals.
Such metals include gold, silver and platinum, metals which will not scale
or tarnish to any appreciable extent due to the action of atmospheric
oxygen.
Acids, Bases and Salts
1.50 When an oxide of a non-metal combines with water it forms what
we call an acid. Thus sulphur trioxide (SO3) combines with water to form
the well-known sulphuric acid (H2SO4), and sulphur trioxide is said to be
the anhydride of sulphuric acid. Though not all acids are as corrosive as
sulphuric, it is fairly well known that in cases of accident involving acids
of this type it is necessary to neutralise the acid with some suitable antidote.
1.51 Substances which have this effect are called bases. These are met-
allic oxides (and hydroxides) which, when they react with an acid, produce
water and a chemical compound which we call a salt. Typical examples of
these acid-base reactions are—
H2SO4 + 
CaO 
= CaSO4 + H2O
Sulphuric 
Calcium oxide 
Calcium 
Water
acid 
('quicklime') 
sulphate
(a salt)
HCl 
+NaOH= NaCl +H2O
Hydrochloric 
Sodium 
Sodium
acid 
hydroxide 
chloride
('caustic 
('common
soda') 
salt')
We can generalise in respect of equations like this and say—
Acid + Base = Salt + Water
Similarly, the acid anhydride will often combine with a base, forming a
salt, eg—
SO3 + CaO = CaSO4
This type of reaction occurs quite frequently during the smelting of metallic
ores.

1.52 
One of the most common elements in the Earth's crust is silicon,
present in the form of its oxide, silica (SiO2). Since silicon is a non-metal,
its oxide is an acid anhydride, and though all the common forms of silica,
such as sand, sandstone and quartz, do not seem to be of a very reactive
nature at normal temperatures, they are sufficiently reactive when heated
to high temperatures to combine with many of the metallic oxides (which
are basic) and produce neutral salts called silicates. Silica occurs entangled
with most metallic ores, and although some of it is rejected by mechanical
means before the ore is charged to the furnace, some remains and could
constitute a difficult problem in that its high melting point of 1780° C would
cause a sort of 'indigestion' in the furnace. To overcome this a sufficient
quantity of a basic flux is added in order to combine with the silica and
produce a slag with a melting point low enough to allow it to run from the
furnace. The cheapest metallic oxide, and the one in general use, is lime.
SiO2 +2CaO = 2CaO. SiO2

Salt (calcium

The formula for the slag, calcium silicate, is generally written 2CaO.SiO2
rather than Ca2SiO4, since lime and silica will combine in other pro-
portions. When the formula is written in the former manner, the reacting
proportions of silica and lime can be seen at a glance.
1.53 On the other hand acid/basic reactions can constitute a problem
when they involve similar reactions between slags and furnace linings.
Thus, since we do not wish to liquefy our furnace lining, we must make
sure that it does not react with the charge or the slag covering it. In short,
we must make sure that the furnace lining is of the same chemical nature
as the slag, ie if the slag contains an excess of silica, and is therefore acid,
we must line the furnace with a similar silica-rich refractory, such as silica
brick or ganister; whilst if the slag contains an excess of lime or other basic
material, we must line the furnace with a basic refractory, such as burnt
dolomite (CaO.MgO) or burnt magnesite (MgO). If the chemical nature
of the furnace lining is the same as that of the slag, then, clearly, no
reaction is likely to take place between them. Since silica and ganister, on
the one hand, and dolomite and magnesite, on the other, all have high
softening temperatures, they will also be able to resist the high tempera-
tures encountered in many of the metallurgical smelting processes.
Atomic Structure
1.60 It was the Ancient Greek philosopher Leukippos and his disciple
Demokritos who, during the fifth century BC, suggested that if matter
were progressively subdivided a point would be reached where further
subdivision was impossible. The Greek word for 'indivisible' is 'atomos'.
More than 2000 years later—in 1808—a British chemist, John Dalton
announced his Atomic theory which was based on the original Leukippos/

Demokritos idea. Dalton suggested that chemical reactions could be
explained if it was assumed that each chemical element consisted of
extremely small indivisible particles, which, following the Greek concept,
he called 'atoms'. The Theory was generally accepted but before the end
of the nineteenth century it was discovered that atoms were certainly not
indivisible. Thus the 'atom' is an ill-described particle. But the title became
so firmly established that it is retained to-day, though we usually modify
our description to add that it is 'the smallest stable particle of matter which
can exist'.
1.61 In 1897 the English physicist J. J. Thomson showed that a beam
of 'cathode rays' was in fact a stream of fast-moving negatively charged
particles—they were in fact electrons. Because the electron is negatively
charged it can be deflected from its path by an electrical field and we make
use of this feature in TV tubes where a beam of electrons, deflected by a
system of electro-magnetic fields, builds up a picture by impingement on
a screen which will fluoresce under the impact of electrons. Thomson was
able to make only a rough estimate of the mass of the electron but was
able to show that it was extremely small compared with a hydrogen atom.
Thus Dalton's 'indivisible atom' fell apart.
1.62 Since atoms are electrically neutral—common everyday materials
carry no resultant electrical charge—the discovery of the negatively
charged electron stimulated research to find a positively charged particle.
This was ultimately discovered in the form of the nucleus of the hydrogen
atom, with a mass some 1837 times greater than that of the electron but
with an equal but opposite positive charge. In 1920 the famous New Zea-
land born physicist Ernest Rutherford suggested it be called the proton.
So, atoms were assumed to be composed of equal numbers of electrons
and protons, the electrons being arranged in 'shells' or 'orbits' around a
bunch of protons which constituted the nucleus of the atom. But there was
a snag: the true atomic weights of the elements, which had been derived
by careful independent experiment over many years, were much greater
than the atomic weights calculated from an assumption of the numbers of
protons and electrons present in the atom of a particular element. Chemists
explained this 'dead weight' in the atomic nucleus by suggesting that there
were extra protons in the nucleus which had been 'neutralised' electrically
by the presence of electrons also lurking there. Thus in the early 1930s
electrons were classed as being either 'planetary' or 'nuclear.'
1.63 At about this time the English physicist Sir James Chadwick dis-
covered the neutron, a particle of roughly the same mass as the proton but
carrying no electrical charge. Its presence in the atomic nucleus made it
easier to explain that part of the atomic mass not attributable to a simple
electron/proton balance. Its electrical neutrality made it a useful particle
in atomic research, since it could be fired into a nucleus without being
repelled by like electrical charges. Chadwick's discovery did in fact alter
the course of history since it made possible the development of the Atomic
Bomb ten years later (18.74).
1.64 Since Chadwick's time the number of elementary particles has
proliferated. These can be classified into three main groups:

1 Baryons (protons and other particles with a mass greater than that of
the proton).
2 Mesons (any of a group of particles with a rest mass between those of
the electron and proton, and with an integral 'spin').
3 Leptons (among which are the electron, positron or 'positive electron'
and the neutrino which possesses neither charge nor mass but only
'spin').
The term 'quark' is used to describe any one of a number of hypothetical
elementary particles with charges of % or -1A of the electron charge, and
thought to be fundamental units of all baryons and mesons. It is interesting
to note that the word 'quark' was devised by James Joyce in Finnegan's
Wake. Indeed, to date the existence of more than two hundred different
subatomic particles has been reported. Of these only three—electron, pro-
ton and neutron—appear to have any substantial influence on the distinc-
tive properties of each element. Consequently the rest will receive no
further mention in this book. The essential features of electron, proton
and neutron are summarised in Table 1.3. Since the real mass of these
particles is inconveniently small for calculations their masses relative to
that of the carbon atom (isotope C= 12) are generally used.

1.65 In the early days of the twentieth century Rutherford carried out
a series of classical experiments in which he fired a-particles—the nuclei
of helium atoms and therefore positively charged—at very thin gold foil.
Most of these particles passed right through the foil whilst about one in
20 000 rebounded along its incident path. Others were deflected at various
angles to the incident beam. From these experiments Rutherford con-
cluded that the atom consisted of a comparatively small nucleus containing
protons, around which circulated electrons. This concept of the atom was
developed by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. He proposed that the elec-
trons were placed in a series of fixed orbits which varied in number with
the complexity of the atom. The constitution of an atom was thus regarded
as being similar to that of the solar system and containing about the same
density of actual 'matter'. This model was later modified to the extent that
the definite electron orbit was replaced by a mathematical function which
represents the distribution of 'electrons' in the space occupied by the atom.
This distribution is referred to as the orbital of the electron. In fact many
visualise the electron as being in the nature of a 'cloud' of electricity rather
than as a discrete particle, the orbital indicating the density of that cloud
at any point within the atom. From the point of view of any diagram
representing atomic structure it is more convenient to indicate the electron

as being a definite particle travelling in a simple circular orbit round a
nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons, but diagrams such as Fig. 1.1
should be studied with this statement in mind. Fig. 1.1 in no way represents
what atoms 'look like'.
1.66 The most simple of all atoms is that of ordinary hydrogen. It
consists of one proton with one electron in orbital around it. Since the
positive charge of the proton is balanced by the equal but negative charge
of the electron, the resultant atom will be electrically neutral. The mass of
the electron being very small compared with that of the proton, the mass
of the atom will be roughly that of the proton.
1.67 An atom of ordinary helium comes next in order of both mass
and complexity. Here the nucleus contains two protons which are associ-
ated with two electrons in the same 'shell', ie similar orbitals surrounding
the nucleus. The nucleus also contains two neutrons. However, in Table
1.4, which indicates the proton-electron make-up of some of the simpler
atoms, neutrons have been omitted for reasons which will become apparent
later (1.90). The number of protons in the nucleus, which is equal to the
total number of electrons in successive shells, is called the Atomic number
of the element.
In Table 1.4 it will be noted that with the metal lithium a new electron
shell is formed and that this 'fills up' by the addition of a single electron
with each successive element until, with the 'noble'* gas neon, it contains
a total of eight electrons. With the metal sodium another new shell then
begins and similarly fills so that with the noble gas argon this third shell
also contains eight electrons. The next shell then begins to form with the
metal potassium.
1.68 In the case of the elements dealt with in Table 1.4, this periodicity
in respect of the number of electrons in the outer shell is reflected in the
chemical properties of the elements themselves. Thus the metals lithium,
sodium and potassium each have a single electron in the outer shell and
all are very similar chemically. They will all oxidise very rapidly and react
readily with water, liberating hydrogen and forming soluble hydroxides.
Each of these elements has a valence of one. Physically, also, they are very
similar in that they are all light soft metals, more or less white in colour.
In a similar way the gases fluorine and chlorine, with seven electrons in
the outer shell in each case, have like chemical properties. Both are
coloured gases (at normal temperatures and pressures) with strongly non-
metallic properties.
The noble gases helium, neon and argon occur in small quantities in the
atmosphere. In fact it is only there where they are likely to exist under
natural conditions, since these noble gases are similar in being non-
reactive and, under ordinary circumstances, unable to combine with other
elements. Chemical combination between elements is governed by the
number of electrons present in the outer shell of each atom concerned.
When the outer shell contains eight electrons it becomes, as it were, 'satu-
* In the chemical sense the term 'noble' means that an element is not very reactive—thus, the 'noble'
metals, gold, platinum, etc., are not readily attacked by other reactive substances, such as corrosive acids.

rated', so that such an atom will have no tendency to combine with others.
1.69 The periodicity of properties described above was noticed by
chemists quite early in the nineteenth century and led to the advent of
order in inorganic chemistry with the celebrated 'Periodic Classification of
the Elements' by the Russian chemist Demitri Mendeleef in 1864. In more
recent years this periodicity in chemical properties of the elements has
been explained in terms of the electronic structure of the atom as outlined
very briefly above.
In elements with atomic numbers greater than that of potassium, more
complex shells containing more than eight electrons are present in the
atom. These more complex shells are divided into sub-shells and some
'overlapping' of orbitals occurs so that new sub-shells tend to form
before a previous shell has been 'filled' (Table 1.4). This gives rise to
the 'transition metals' situated roughly in the centre of modern versions
of the Periodic Table (Fig. 1.2). Nevertheless, elements in the vertical
columns—or 'Groups'—have similar electron structures and therefore
similar properties.

Chemical Combination and Valence
1.70 It was mentioned above that chemical combination between two
atoms is governed by the number of electrons in the outer electron shell
of each. Moreover, it was pointed out that those elements whose atoms
had eight electrons in the outer shell (the noble gases neon and argon) had
no inclination to combine with other elements and therefore had no chemi-
cal affinity. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the completion of
the 'octet' of electrons in the outer shell of an atom leads to a valence of
zero. The noble gas helium, with a completed 'duplet' of electrons in the
single shell, behaves in a similar manner.
As far as the simpler atoms we have been discussing are concerned the
tendency is for them to attempt to attain this noble-gas structure of a stable
octet (or duplet) of electrons in the outer shell. Their chemical properties
are reflected in this tendency. With the more complex atoms the situation
is not quite so simple, since these atoms possess larger outer shells which
are generally sub-divided, to the extent that electrons may begin to fill a
new outer 'sub-shell' before the penultimate sub-shell has been completed.
As mentioned above this would explain the existence of groups of metallic
elements the properties of which are transitional between those of one
well-defined group and those of the next. The broad principles of the
electronic theory of valence mentioned here in connection with the simpler
atoms will apply. On these general lines three main forms of combination
exist.
1.71 Electro-valent Combination 
In this type of combination a metallic
atom loses the electrons which constitute its outer shell (or sub-shell) and
the number of electrons so lost are equivalent to the numerical valence of
the element. These lost electrons are transferred to the outer electron shells
of the non-metallic atom (or atoms) with which the metal is combining. In
this way a complete shell of electrons is left behind in the metallic particle
whilst a hitherto incomplete shell is filled in the non-metallic particle.
Let us consider the combination which takes place between the metal
sodium and the non-metal chlorine to form sodium chloride (common
salt). The sodium atom has a single electron in its outer shell and this
transfers to join the seven electrons in the outer shell of the chlorine atom.
When this occurs each resultant particle is left with a complete octet in the
outer shell. (The sodium particle now has the same electron structure as the
noble gas neon, and the chlorine particle has the same electron structure as
the noble gas argon.) The balance of electrical charges which existed
between protons and electrons in the original atoms is, however, upset.
Since the sodium atom has lost a negatively charged particle (an electron),
the remaining sodium particle must now possess a resultant positive charge.
Meanwhile the chlorine atom has gained this electron so the resultant
chlorine particle must carry a negative charge. These charged particles,
derived from atoms in this manner, are called ions. In terms of symbols
the sodium ion is written thus, Na+, and the chlorine ion, Cl".
1.72 
Since sodium ions and chlorine ions are oppositely charged they

All elements with atomic numbers above 92 are 'artificial'—the products of the nuclear scientist. Since this classification
was last revised numbers 107 (Uns), 108 (Uno) and 109 (Une) have been reported. Soviet scientists are claiming 110
(Uun). Fortunately the fashion for assigning 'patriotic' names to these relatively unimportant metals is now past, and
IUPAC (the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) allocates to each new element a name which states
its atomic number in 'Dog Latin'. Thus 'Unq' (104) is 'Unnilquadum', ie Un-nil-quadum or 1-0-4; whilst 'Uun' (110) is
'Ununnilium', ie Un-un-nilium or 1-1-0.

will attract each other and the salt sodium chloride crystallises in a simple
cubic form in which sodium ions and chlorine ions arrange themselves in
the manner indicated in Fig. 1.4. Except for the force of attraction which
exists between oppositely charged particles, no other 'bond' exists between
sodium ions and chlorine ions, and when a crystal of sodium chloride is
dissolved in water separate sodium and chlorine ions are released and can
move as separate particles in solution. Such a solution is known as an
electrolyte because it will conduct electricity. If we place two electrodes
into such a solution and connect them to a direct-current supply, the posi-
tively charged sodium ions will travel to the negative electrode and the
negatively charged chlorine ions will travel to the positive electrode. The
applied EMF does not 'split up' the sodium chloride—the latter ionises as
soon as it dissolves in water.
1.73 Thus, the unit in solid sodium chloride is the crystal, whilst in
solution separate ions of sodium and chlorine exist. In reality there is no
sodium chloride molecule and it is therefore incorrect to express the salt
as 'NaCl'. Busy chemists are, however, in the habit of using symbols in
this manner as a type of chemical shorthand. The author has in fact been
guilty of this indiscretion earlier in this chapter when discussing formulae
and equations in which electro-valent compounds are involved. For
example, the equation representing the reaction between hydrochloric acid
and caustic soda (1.51) would more correctly be written:

1.74 It was suggested earlier in this chapter (1.40) that the term 'oxida-

with oxygen. Thus, when metallic iron combines with the gas chlorine to

form iron(//) chloride, FeCl2, the iron is said to have been oxidised, whilst
when the iron(II) chloride so produced combines with still more chlorine
to form iron(///) chloride, FeCl3, the iron(II) chloride in turn has been
oxidised. At each stage the 'electronegative portion' of the substance has
increased. We can now relate this process of oxidation to a transfer of
electrons. In being oxidised, an atom of iron has lost electrons to become
an ion—first the iron(//) ion, Fe++, at which stage it has lost two electrons
and then the iron(///) ion, Fe+++, when it has lost three electrons to the
chlorine atoms:
Fe + Cl2-+Fe++ +2Cr-^>Fe + + + +3Cl"
iron(II) chloride 
iron(III) chloride
Thus oxidation of a substance, in this case iron, involves a loss of electrons
by atoms of that substance.
Conversely, reduction involves a gain of electrons. For example, when
iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, is reduced to metallic iron in the blast furnace the
Fe+++ ion receives electrons and becomes an atom of iron:
Fe+ + + + 3 e - > F e
1.75 Covalent Combination In this type of chemical combination there
is no loss' of electrons from one atom to another. Instead a certain number
of electrons are 'shared' between two or more atoms to produce a stable
particle which we call a molecule. In a molecule of the gas methane, four
hydrogen atoms are combined with one carbon atom. The carbon atom
has four electrons in its outer shell, but these are joined by four more
electrons, contributed singly by each of the four hydrogen atoms (Fig. 1.6).
Thus the octet of the carbon atom is completed and at the same time, by
sharing one of the carbon atom's electrons, each hydrogen atom is able to
complete its 'helium duplet'. This sharing of electrons by two atoms binds
them together, and a molecule is formed in which atoms are held together
by strong valence bonds. Each shared electron now passes from an orbital
controlled by one nucleus into an orbital controlled by two nuclei and it is
this control which constitutes the covalent bond. Chemists express the
structural formula for the methane molecule thus:

Each co-valent bond is indicated so: —. Co-valent compounds, since
they do not ionise, will not conduct electricity and are therefore non-

As the molecule size of co-valent compounds increases, so the bond

strength of the material increases, as indicated in complex compounds such
as rubber and vegetable fibres. Sometimes simple molecules of co-valent
compounds can be made to unite with molecules of their own type, forming
large chain-type molecules in which the bond strength is very high. This
process is called 'polymerisation'. For example, the gas ethene C2H4 can
be made to polymerise forming polythene:

As the molecular chain increases in length, the strength also increases.
Nylon (synthesised from benzene) and polychloroethene* (synthesised
from ethine*) are both 'super polymers', the strength of which depends
upon a long chain of carbon atoms co-valently bonded.
Forces of attraction (1.80), acting between points where these 'chain
molecules' touch each other, hold the mass of them together. If such a
substance is heated, the forces acting between the molecules are reduced
and, under stress, the fibrous molecules will gradually slide over each
other into new permanent positions. The substance is then said to be
thermoplastic. Substances which (like water) are built up of simple mol-
ecules generally melt at a sharply defined single temperature since there is
no entanglement, as exists with the ungainly molecules of the super poly-
mers, and when the forces of attraction between simple molecules fall
below a certain limit they can separate instantaneously. Super polymers,
then, soften progressively as the temperature is increased rather than melt
at a well-defined temperature.
Some polymers, when heated, undergo a chemical change which firmly
anchors the chain molecules to each other by means of co-valent bonds.

On cooling, the material is rigid and is said to be thermosetting. Bakelite
is such a substance.
Rubber possesses elasticity (4.11) by virtue of the folded nature of its
long-chain molecules. When stressed, one of these molecules will extend
after the fashion of a spiral spring and, when the stress is removed, it will
return to its original shape. In raw rubber the tensile stress will also cause
the chain molecules to slide relative to each other, so that, when the stress
is removed, some permanent deformation will remain in the material (Fig.
1.7). If the raw rubber is mixed with sulphur and heated it becomes 'vulcan-
ised'. That is, sulphur causes the formation of co-valent links between the
large rubber molecules which are thus held firmly together. Consequently,
vulcanised rubber possesses elasticity due to the behaviour of its folded
chain molecules, but it resists permanent deformation, since these mol-
ecules are no longer able to slide over each other into new positions.
Fig. 1.7. 
Rubber molecules are of the long-chain type.
Due to their 'folded' form they become extended in tension, but return to their original shapes
when the stress is removed. In raw rubber (i) a steady tensile force will cause separate
molecules to glide slowly past each other into new positions, so that when the force is
removed some plastic deformation remains, although the elastic deformation has dis-
appeared. By 'vulcanising' the raw rubber (ii) the chain molecules are bonded together so
that no permanent plastic deformation can occur and only elastic deformation is possible.

1.76 The Metallic Bond In most pure metals, atoms possess insufficient
valence electrons to be able to form covalent bonds with each other. On
the other hand any metallic ions which may be formed in a pure metal
will carry like positive charges and so tend to repel each other so that
electrovalent bonding is impossible. Yet we know that metals are crystal-
line in the solid state (3.10). How then is this situation achieved?
The explanation generally offered is that the valence electrons of each
atom are donated to a common 'cloud' which is shared by all atoms present
(Fig. 1.8). Thus, whilst the positively-charged ions which result, repel each
other so that they arrange themselves in a regular pattern, they are held
in these equilibrium positions by their mutual attraction for the negatively
charged electron cloud which permeates them. Individual electrons no
longer 'belong' to any particular atom but are the common property of all
atoms present.
Fig. 1.8 
Diagrammatic representation of the metallic bond.
A more detailed knowledge of the structure of the atom would indicate
that the situation is not nearly so simple that metallic bonding can be
explained in terms of this 'electron cloud' concept. However, for our pre-
sent purposes it will be sufficient if we accept the results of this simpli-
fied interpretation, since it enables us to explain many characteristically
metallic properties.
Since valence electrons in the common 'cloud' are able to travel freely
among the positive ions this gives an explanation of the high electrical
conductivity of metals, a current of electricity being nothing more than a
movement of electrons in a particular direction. In a covalently-bonded
compound on the other hand valence electrons are held captive in the
chemical bond. Consequently most of the organic compounds—polythene,
PVC and nylon—are insulators whilst liquids such as alcohols, benzene
and oils are non-electrolytes.
The opaque lustre of metals is due to the reflection of light by free

electrons. A light wave striking the surface of a metal causes a free electron
to vibrate and absorb all the energy of the wave, thus stopping trans-
mission. The vibrating electron then re-emits the wave from the metal
surface giving rise to what we term 'reflection'.
The very important property of most metals in being able to undergo
considerable plastic deformation is also due to the existence of the metallic
bond. Under the action of shearing forces, layers of positive ions can be
made to slide over each other without drastically altering their relationship
with the shared electron cloud.
Secondary Bonding Forces
1.80 Stable atoms—and molecules—always contain equal numbers of
protons and electrons. Consequently they will be electrically neutral and
carry no resultant charge. Yet they must attract each other for how else
can we explain the fact that all gases condense to form liquids and that all
liquids either crystallise to form solids or else become so viscous that the
strong forces of attraction between molecules make them behave almost
like solids?
In short, whilst we have related the cohesion between metallic particles
to the metallic bond we have not yet attempted to explain the forces which
hold together covalently bonded molecules, or, for that matter, the single
atoms in noble gases which, although they contain no valence electrons,
must attract each other in some way since they ultimately liquify and
solidify at very low temperatures. These weak secondary bonding forces
are often referred to as van der Waals' forces since it was this Dutch
physicist who first explained the deviations in the Gas Law (PV = RT) as
being partly due to forces of attraction between molecules (or atoms in the
case of noble gases) within the gas.
Consider two atoms of a noble gas such as argon. If these two atoms are
in close proximity and their electrons happen to be concentrated as in Fig.
1.9, it is reasonable to suppose that mutual attraction will occur between
the positively charged nucleus of atom X and the negatively charged elec-
trons of atom Y at the moment when the nucleus of X is 'unshielded'
by its own electrons. This situation will be continually changing as the
distribution of electrons alters, but a resultant weak force of attraction
exists.
Engineers will be familiar with the idea of 'centre of mass' in a solid
body. In a similar way we can imagine electrical charges 'resolved' to give
'centres' of positive and negative charges respectively in a molecule. If

these centres do not coincide (Fig. 1.10) then the molecule will have a
small dipole moment and will consequently attract (and be attracted by)
other molecules with similar dipole moments.
In a molecule of water (Fig. 1.11 (i)) the two electrons which are contrib-
uted to the covalent bonds by the two hydrogen atoms tend to be drawn
to the vicinity of the larger oxygen atom. Thus the centre of negative
charge is shifted nearer to the oxygen atom leaving the positively-charged
nuclei of the hydrogen atoms relatively 'exposed'. Consequently the water
molecule has a very strong dipole moment and therefore a relatively strong
force of attraction for its neighbours (Fig. 1.11 (ii)).
For this reason water has an abnormally high freezing point and boiling
point as compared with other substances of similar molecular size. For
example, methane melts at — 183°C and boils at — 162°C.
Particularly strong van der Waals' forces arise from the behaviour of the
hydrogen atom in this way and are referred to as 'hydrogen bonds'.
When considered singly van der Waals' forces are very weak when com-
pared with the forces acting within a single covalent bond. The combined
effect, however, of van der Waals' forces acting at a large number of
points between two adjacent chain-like polymer molecules such as those of
polythene (1.75) can be very considerable. It also explains why polymer
materials, though weaker than metals are highly plastic.
Isotopes
1.90 In the foregoing discussion of the mechanism of chemical combi-
nation no mention was made of the part played by the neutron. In fact the
neutron, carrying no resultant electrical charge, has no apparent effect on

ordinary chemical properties which are mainly a function of the electron
structure of the atom. The principal role of the neutron is to increase the
actual mass of an atom. Thus, the sodium atom with 12 neutrons in the
nucleus, in addition to the 11 protons already mentioned, has a total
nuclear mass of 23. The 11 electrons present are negligible in mass when
compared with the massive protons and neutrons, so that the mass of the
total atom is approximately 23 units, and it is from this value that the
relative atomic mass is derived.
There are many instances, however, in which two atoms contain the
same number of protons but unequal numbers of neutrons. Clearly, since
they have equal numbers of protons, they will also have equal numbers of
electrons and, chemically, such atoms will be identical. Differing numbers
of neutrons, however, in respective atoms will cause these atoms to have
unequal masses. An element possessing atoms which are chemically identi-
cal but which are of different mass is said to be isotopic and the different
groups are known as isotopes.
1.91 Two such isotopes occur in the element chlorine. The chemical
properties of these isotopes are identical because in each case an atom will
contain 17 protons and 17 electrons. Only the relative masses of each atom
will be different, since the nucleus of isotope II contains two more neutrons
than that of isotope I (Fig. 1.12). Since there are about three times as
many atoms of isotope I (usually written 35Cl) as of isotope II (written
37Cl) the relative atomic mass of chlorine 'averages out' at 35.45.
Fig. 1.12 
The particle 'make-up' of the two isotopes of chlorine.
1.92 There are three isotopes of hydrogen of atomic masses one, two
and three respectively (Fig. 1.13). The 'ordinary' hydrogen atom (now
called 'protium') contains a single proton in its nucleus—and no neutrons.
Its atomic mass is therefore one. However, approximately one hydrogen
atom in every 6900 also contains a neutron in its nucleus and since the
proton and neutron are roughly equal in mass then the atomic mass of the

atom will be two. This atom, often known as 'heavy hydrogen', fH, is also
given the special name deuterium and is the basis of the 'hydrogen bon b
reaction'. A third, radioactive, isotope of hydrogen, called tritium, contai s
two neutrons along with the proton in the nucleus and so has an atomic
mass of three, ie iH. It must be emphasised that deuterium and tritium
are not different elements from hydrogen but only isotopes of that element.
It is perhaps fortunate that separate isotopes of other elements are not
given special names in this manner or confusion would be rife. The term
'isotope' tends to be associated in modern technology with the release of
nuclear energy by suitable elements. The properties of the isotopes of
uranium in this connection are dealt with later (18.75).

The Physical and
Mechanical Properties of
Metals and Alloys
2.10 Of well over one hundred elements—if we include the increasing
number of man-made ones—only eighteen have definite non-metallic
properties. Six are usually classed as 'metalloids'—elements like silicon,
germanium and arsenic—in which physical and chemical properties are
generally intermediate between those of metals and non-metals, but the
remainder have clearly defined metallic properties. Metals are generally
characterised by their lustrous, opaque appearance and, in respect of other
physical properties, metals and non-metals contrast strongly.
As we have seen (1.76) a metal consists of an orderly array of ions
surrounded by and held together by a cloud of electrons. This is reflected
in many of the physical properties of metals.
2.11 Melting point All metals (except mercury) are solids at ambient
temperatures and have relatively high melting points (see Table 1.1) which
vary between 234K (-390C) for mercury and 3683K (34100C) for tungsten.
Non-metals include gases, a liquid (bromine) and solids. Their melting
points vary much more widely: between IK (-2720C) for helium and
approximately 5300K (50000C) for carbon.
2.12 Density The relative density (formerly specific gravity) of a material
is defined as
the weight of a given volume of the material
the weight of an equal volume of water.
Metals generally have higher relative densities (Table 1.1) than non-
metals. Values vary between lithium (0.534) which will float in water and
osmium (22.5) which is almost twice the density of lead, which suggests
that the simile 'as heavy as lead' needs revision.

2.13 Electrical conductivity Non-metals are generally very poor con-
ductors of electricity, indeed those where the bonding is entirely covalent
will be insulators since all valance electrons are held captive in individual
bonds and can move only in restricted orbits. By comparison in metals
electrical conductivity arises from the presence of a sea or cloud of mobile
electrons permeating the static array of ions. The electrons are able to flow
through the ion framework when a potential difference is applied across
the ends of the metal—which may be many miles apart as in the electric
grid system. As indicated in Table 2.1 the electrical and thermal conduc-
tivities of metals follow roughly the same order. This is to be expected
since both the flow of electricity and heat depend upon the ability of
electrons to move freely within the metallic structure. For purposes of
simple comparison Table 2.1 relates electrical and thermal conductivities
of some important metals to those of silver (100). Although silver is mar-
ginally superior in terms of electrical conductivity to copper, the latter is
used industrially because of relative costs. In fact for power transmission
through the national grid aluminium lines are generally used for reasons
given later (17.13). Electrical conductivity is reduced by alloying and the
presence of impurities (16.21) as well as by mechanical straining.

Electrical conductivity is measured in units Sm"1, where the unit of
conductance the Siemen (S), is equivalent to Q "!. Generally it is more
convenient to consider the electrical resistivity (Q) of a material which is
the inverse of its conductance and is of course measured in flm. Resistivity
varies with temperature and over a limited temperature range a linear
relationship of the form:
Rt = R(I + Qt)
holds good. Here Rt is the resistance at the upper temperature, R the
initial resistance and t the increase in temperature. Q is the temperature
coefficient of resistance of the material.

2.14 Thermal conductivity This arises in a similar way to electrical con-
ductivity. Electrons pick up kinetic energy from the increased vibrations
of the ions where the metal is hot. They pass rapidly through the ion
framework where they collide with distant ions, causing them in turn to
vibrate more rapidly. In this manner electrons behave as transporters of
energy.
Metals are very good conductors of heat whereas most non-metals are
not. The flow of heat in a conductor is governed by:
Q=-X f
dx
where Q is the heat flow across unit area, X is the coefficient of thermal
ri T
conductivity and T the temperature. — will be the 'temperature gradient'
dx
at that unit area. Thermal conductivity is measured in units, Wm-1K"1.
2.15 Specific heat capacity The specific heat capacity (Cp, Cv) of a
substance is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of lkg
of the substance IK. The units are JlCg-1K"1. The specific heat capacities
of metals are low compared with those of non-metals so that it is less
expensive to raise their temperatures.
Dulong and Petit's Law states that for all elements the product of the
specific heat capacity and the atomic weight is approximately constant and
this product is called the Atomic heat. This law was used more than a
century ago to assess the atomic weights of many (then) new elements. It
involves the relationship between heat capacity and the vibrational energy
of atoms.

2.16 Thermal expansion As materials are heated the amplitude of
atomic vibrations increases and this is evident as an increase in volume.
The coefficient of cubic expansion (y) is the increase in volume per unit

ductor.

volume per unit rise in temperature (unit, K l). Similarly the coefficient of
linear expansion (a) is the increase in length per unit length per unit rise
in temperature (unit, K"1) or 
a = - 
-
where lo = original length; lt = length after a rise in temperature of t.
By suitable alloying additions to some metals it is possible to reduce a
to low limits. Thus Invar (13.25) is used in long measuring tapes, pendulum
rods for observatory clocks (before the days of electronic timekeeping),
etc., whilst similar alloys are used in the delicate sliding mechanisms of
instruments used under conditions of widely varying temperature, eg mili-
tary rangefinders used in desert warfare. Further alloys are also used in
bimetallic strips in small thermostats where the differential expansion of
the two alloys of the strip leads to bending of the unit and a make/break
contact.
2.17 Behaviour to light Most metals reflect all wavelengths of light
equally well for which reason they are white or nearly so. Notable excep-
tions are copper and gold whilst zinc is very faintly blue and lead slightly
purple.
The reflecting capacity of metals is yet another aspect of the mobility of
its electrons; an incident light wave causes the electrons near the surface
of a metal to oscillate and as a result the incident wave is reflected back
instead of being absorbed by the metal. Thus the reflection in a mirror is
due to the oscillation caused in silver's mobile electron cloud.
2.18 Behaviour to short-wavelength radiations Metals are transparent
to y-rays (2.93) and to those X-rays of short wavelength ('hard' X-rays)
(2.91).
2.19 Magnetic properties Most metals are magnetic to some slight
extent but only in the metals iron, nickel, cobalt and gadolinium is magnet-
ism strong enough to be of practical interest. The pronounced magnetism
of this group is called 'ferromagnetism' (14.30).
Whilst many of these physical properties such as conductivity, magnet-
ism and melting point dictate special uses for metals, it is mechanical
properties such as strength, ductility and toughness which concern us prin-
cipally in engineering design.
Fundamental Mechanical Properties
2.20 Whereas the directional nature of the covalent bond results in the
extreme rigidity of substances like diamond and quartz, the non-directional
nature of the metallic bond makes it relatively easy to bend a piece of
metal. Moving groups of metallic ions through the electron 'sea' can be
achieved in a number of ways such as hammering, rolling, stretching and
bending. Fundamental mechanical properties of metals are related to the

amounts of deformation which metals can withstand under different cir-
cumstances of force application. Ductility refers to the capacity of a sub-
stance to undergo deformation under tension without rupture, as in wire-
or tube-drawing operations. Malleability, on the other hand, is the capacity
of a substance to withstand deformation under compression without rup-
ture, as in forging or rolling. Substances which are highly ductile are also
highly malleable but the reverse may not be true since some extremely
malleable substances are weak in tension and therefore liable to tear.
Moreover, whilst malleability is usually increased by raising the tempera-
ture (for which reason metals and alloys are often hot-forged or hot-rolled),
ductility is generally reduced by heating, since strength is also reduced.
2.21 Toughness refers to a metal's ability to withstand bending or the
application of shear stresses without fracture. Hence, copper is extremely
tough, whilst cast iron is not. Toughness should not, therefore, be confused
with either strength or hardness, properties which will be discussed later.
2.22 Since these fundamental mechanical properties of ductility, malle-
ability and toughness cannot be expressed in simple quantitative terms, it
has become necessary to introduce certain mechanical tests which are
related to these properties and which will allow of comparative numerical
interpretation. Moreover, the engineer is more concerned with the forces
which cause deformation in metals rather than with the deformation itself.
Consequently tensile tests and hardness tests correlate the amounts of
deformation produced with given forces in tension and compression
respectively, whilst impact tests are an almost direct measurement of
toughness. Such precise measurements of force-deformation values make
it possible to draw up sets of specifications upon which the mechanical
engineer can base his design.
Tenacity or Tensile Strength
2.30 The tensile strength of a material is defined as the maximum force
required to fracture in tension a bar of unit cross-sectional area. In practice
a test-piece of known cross-sectional area is gripped in the jaws of a testing
machine and subjected to a tensile force which is increased by suitable
increments. For each increment of force the amount by which the length
of a pre-determined 'gauge length' on the test piece increases is measured
by some device. The test piece is extended in this way to destruction.
A force-extension diagram can then be plotted (Fig. 2.1). At first the rate
of extension is very small and such extension as there is is directly pro-
portional to the applied force; that is, OQ is a straight line. If the applied
force is removed at any point before Q is reached the gauge-length will return
to its original dimensions. Thus the extension between O and Q is elastic
and the material obeys Hooke's Law, which states that, for an elastic
body, the strain produced is proportional to the stress applied. The value
Stress— is constant and is equivalent to the slope of OQ. This constant value

is known as Young's Modulus of Elasticity (E) for the material. Consider
a test piece of original length, L, and cross-sectional area, 'a', stretched
elastically by an amount, T, under a force, P, acting along the axis of the
specimen, then:

Young's Modulus is in fact a measure of the stiffness of the material in
tension. This value and the stress range over which it applies are of great
importance to the engineer. Young's modulus is measured in the same
units as those of stress, since:

If at any point on the part of the curve under consideration the force is
relaxed then the test piece will return to its original length, extension so
far being entirely elastic.
2.31 If the test piece is stressed beyond the point O the curve deviates
from its straight-line characteristics. Q is therefore known as the elastic
limit or limit of proportionality and if the force is increased beyond this
point a stage is reached where a sudden extension takes place for no
increase in the applied force (assuming that we are testing a specimen of
annealed low-carbon steel as indicated in Fig. 2.1). An explanation of this
phenomenon, known as the yield point, R, will be given later (8.61). If
the force is now removed the elastic extension will disappear but a small
permanent plastic extension or permanent set will remain.
As the force is increased beyond the point R the test piece stretches
rapidly—first uniformly along its entire length and then locally to form a
'neck'. This 'necking' occurs just after the maximum force value has been
reached at S, and since the cross-section decreases rapidly at the neck, the
force at B required to break the test piece is less than the maximum force
applied at S.
This might be an appropriate moment at which to mention the difference
between a 'force/extension' diagram and a 'stress/strain' diagram since
these terms are often loosely used by both metallurgists and engineers.
Fig. 2.1 clearly represents a force/extension diagram since total force is
plotted against total extension, and, as the force decreases past the point
S, for reasons just mentioned, the decrease is indicated on the diagram.
Stress however is measured as force per unit area of cross-section of the
test-piece and if we wished to plot this we would need to measure the
minimum diameter of the test piece at each increment of applied force.
This would be particularly important for values of force after the point S,
since from S onwards the effective cross-section is decreasing rapidly due
to the formation of the neck. The test piece is only as strong as the force
its minimum diameter will support.
If stress were calculated on this decreasing cross-section the resulting
stress/strain diagram would follow a path indicated by the broken line to
Bi from S onwards. In practice, however, a nominal value of the tensile
strength of a material is calculated using the maximum force (at S) and the
original cross-sectional area of the test piece. Therefore:
Maximum force used
Tensile strength = _ . .— 
:—
Original area or cross-section
In this connection the term 'engineering stress' is often used; it implies the
force at any stage of the loading cycle divided by the original area of
cross-section of the material.
Although tensile strength is a useful guide to the mechanical properties
of a material it is not of paramount importance in engineering design.
After all, the engineer is not particularly interested in a material once it
begins to stretch plastically—unless of course he is a production engineer
engaged in deep-drawing or some other metal-forming process. In the case

of structural or constructional engineering, the elastic limit, Q, will be of
far greater significance than tensile strength.
2.32 The form of force/extension diagram described above is in fact a
special case, obtained only for wrought irons and low-carbon steels in the
soft condition (8.61). Most alloys, particularly if they have been heat-
treated or cold-worked, show neither a definite elastic limit nor a yield
point and give, on test, diagrams of the types shown in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3.

condition.

Since the yield point is of greater importance to the engineer than the
tensile strength itself, it becomes necessary to specify a stress which corre-
sponds to a definite amount of permanent extension as a substitute for the
yield point. This is commonly called the 'Proof Stress', and is derived as
shown in Fig. 2.4. A line BC is drawn parallel to the line of proportionality,
from a pre-determined point B. The stress corresponding to C will be the
proof stress—in the case illustrated it will be known as the '0.1% proof
stress', since AB has been made equal to 0.1% of the gauge length. The
material will fulfil the specification therefore if, after the proof force is
applied for fifteen seconds and removed, a permanent set of not more than
0.1% of the gauge length has been produced. Proof lengths are commonly
0.1 and 0.2% of the gauge length depending upon the type of alloy. The
time limit of 15 seconds is specified in order to allow sufficient time for
extension to be complete under the proof force.
Fig. 2.4 
Method used to obtain the 0.1 % proof stress.
2.33 In addition to determining the tensile strength and the proof stress
(or, alternatively, the yield stress), the percentage elongation of the test
piece at fracture is also derived. This is an almost direct measure of duc-
tility. The two ends of the broken test piece are fitted together (Fig. 2.5)
so that the total extension can be measured.
In order that values of percentage elongation derived from test pieces of
different diameter shall be comparable, test pieces should be geometrically
similar, that is, there must be a standard relationship or ratio between
cross-sectional area and gauge length. Test pieces which are geometrically
similar and fulfil these requirements are known as proportional test pieces.
They are commonly circular in cross-section. BSI lays down that, for pro-
portional test pieces:

where L0 is the gauge length and So the original area of cross-section. This
formula has been accepted by international agreement and SI units are
used. For test pieces of circular cross-section it gives a value
L0 ^ 5d
where 'd' is the diameter at the gauge length. Thus a test piece 200 mm2
in cross sectional area will have a diameter of 15.96 mm (16 mm) and
hence a gauge length of 80 mm. Some old tensile testing machines may
still be calibrated in 'tons force'. Since 10 kN = 1.00361 tonf, dual value
scales are not necessary, since, within the accuracy required, 1 tonf = 10
kN.
2.34 The smallest diameter, S0, of the neck is measured and from it
the percentage reduction in area calculated (Fig. 2.5). Thus, from our
complete set of observations we can derive the following values:

of one square metre in cross-section, most bodies, including BSI, quote
tensile stress in metals in N/mm2. This at least enables the student to relate
the tensile strength of a steel to the force necessary to break in tension
one of the thicker steel strings on his guitar.
2.35 Early tensile-testing machines were of the simple beam type in
which the applied force was magnified by using a first-order lever system.
With such machines an accurate evaluation of extension was possible up to
the elastic limit by using a sensitive extensometer but beyond the maximum
force, determinations of force/extension characteristics were impossible
because the test piece fractured quickly as soon as necking began, there
being no means of relaxing the applied force rapidly enough. Modern
machines however are usually servo-hydraulically loaded (Plate 2.1) so that
a complete force/extension relationship can be obtained. Since advanced
computer control technology is now employed automatic calculation of
proof stress, yield stress, ultimate tensile stress and percentage elongation
are carried out; whilst software is available for cycling and data storage.
Software programs can be written to meet other specific requirements.
These machines can also be used for compression and transverse testing,
and vary in size between large machines with a capacity of 1300 kN and
small bench models having a capacity of only 20 kN.
2.36. In situations where a large amount of energy is being expended
against gravity as in various types of aero-space travel—or even driving
the humble 'tin Lizzie' up a hill—it becomes necessary to relate the tensile
properties of a material to its relative density. Thus, what used to be called
the 'strength-to-weight ratio' became important in the design of both land
and air transport vehicles. In modern terminology this became 'specific
strength'. Thus:
.„ 
,

Specific strength =

When stiffness is the prime consideration, however, Young's Modulus of
Elasticity is a more appropriate guide to the required properties and a
value termed specific modulus is now generally accepted as being relevant,
ie—
Young's modulus of elasticity
Specific modulus of elasticity = 
iTTT-—"A

Hardness Tests
2.40 Classically, hardness could be defined as the resistance of a surface
to abrasion, and early attempts to measure surface hardness were based
on this concept. Thus in the Turner Sclerometer a loaded diamond point
was drawn across the surface of the test piece and the load increased until
a visible scratch was produced. In Moh's Scale—still used to evaluate the
hardness of minerals—substances were arranged in order of hardness such

that any material in the scale would scratch any material listed below it.
Thus diamond (with a hardness index of 10) heads the list whilst talc (with
an index of 1) is at the foot of the scale.
Whilst such methods undoubtedly reflect a true concept of the funda-
mental meaning of hardness, they have been abandoned in favour of
methods which are capable of greater accuracy but in which the resistance
of the surface layers to plastic deformation under static pressure is
measured rather than true hardness. In most of these methods the static
force used is divided by the numerical value of the surface area of the
resulting impression to give the hardness index.
2.41 The Brinell Test, probably the best known of the hardness tests,
was devised by a Swede, Dr. Johan August Brinell in 1900. In this test a
hardened steel ball is pressed into the surface of the test piece using the
appropriate specified force. The diameter of the impression so produced
is then measured and the Brinell Hardness Number, HBy derived from:
Force, P
B 
Surface area of impression
It can be shown that the surface area of the impression is
n—l D - yJD2 - d2 j where D is the diameter of the ball and 'd' the diameter
of the impression (Fig. 2.6). Since we are dealing with the actual area of
the curved surface of the impression the derivation of the above expression
is quite involved.
Hence,
and the units will be kgf/mm2. To obviate tedious calculations HB is found
by reference to the appropriate set of tables.
2.42 It is obviously important that the stress produced by the indenter
at the surface of the test piece shall suit the material being tested. If for
example in testing a soft metal we use a force which is too great relative
to the diameter of the ball, we shall get an impression similar to that

indicated in Fig. 2.7A. Here the ball has sunk to its full diameter and the
result is obviously meaningless. The impression shown in Fig. 2.7B on
the other hand would be obtained if the force were too small relative to
the ball diameter and here the result would be likely to be very uncertain.
For different materials then, the ratio P/D2 has been standardised in order
to obtain accurate and comparable results. P is measured in kgf and D in
mm.

Fig. 2.7 The influence of depth of impression on the accuracy of a Brinell determination.
Thus in testing a piece of steel we can use either a 10-mm ball in conjunc-
tion with a 3000 kgf load; a 5 mm ball with a 750 kgf load; or a 1 mm ball
with a 30 kgf load. In the interests of accuracy it is always advisable to use
the largest ball diameter that is possible. The limiting factors will be the
width and thickness of the test piece, and the small ball would be used for
thin specimens, since by using the large ball we would probably be, in
effect, measuring the hardness of the table supporting our test piece. The
thickness of the specimen should be at least eight times the depth, 'h', of
the impression (Fig. 2.6). Similarly the width of the test piece must be
adequate to support the applied force and it is recommended that the
distance of the centre of the indentation from the edge of the test piece
shall be at least three times the diameter of the indenting ball.
2.43 The Vickers Hardness Test—or Diamond Pyramid Hardness
Test —uses as its indenter a diamond square-based pyramid (Fig. 2.8)
which will give geometrically similar impressions under different applied
forces.
This eliminates the necessity of deciding the correct P/D2 ratio as is
required in the Brinell test. Moreover, the diamond is more reliable for
hard materials which have a hardness index of more than 500, since it does
not deform under pressure to the same extent as a steel ball. Using the
diamond point, however, does not eliminate the necessity of ensuring that

the thickness of the specimen is sufficient, relative to the depth of the
impression.
In this test the diagonal length of the square impression is measured by
means of a microscope which has a variable slit built into the eyepiece
(Fig.2.8 (iii)). The width of the slit is adjusted so that its edges coincide
with the corners of the impression and the relative diagonal length of the
impression then obtained from a small instrument attached to the slit which
works on the principle of a revolution counter. The ocular reading thus
obtained is converted to Vickers Pyramid Hardness Number by reference
to tables. The hardness index is related to the size of the impression in the
same way as is the Brinell number.

2.44 The Rockwell Test was devised in the USA, and is particularly
suitable for rapid routine testing of finished material since it indicates the
final result direct on a dial which is calibrated with a series of scales. A

used in conjunction with the appropriate scale:

2.45 The Shore Scleroscope 
(Greek: 'skleros'—hard) tests the
material very near to its surface. The instrument embodies a small dia-
mond-tipped 'tup' which is allowed to fall from a standard height inside a
graduated glass tube. The height of rebound is taken as the hardness index.
Since the Shore Scleroscope is a small, portable instrument, it is very useful
for the determination of hardness of large rolls, castings and gears, and
other large components which could not easily be placed on the testing
tables of any of the more orthodox testing machines.
The development of digital display units has enabled very small portable
hardness testers of the indentation type to be manufactured. One of these
consists of a small motorised probe which, when pressed against the surface
of the test piece, makes a minute diamond impression using a force of
only 8.4 N. Consequently such a test is virtually non-destructive and the
instrument can be used in the most remote corners of the factory, hangar
or repair yard. At the same time a high accuracy of ± 15 VPN is claimed
over the hardness range of 50 to 995 VPN. Such instruments have largely
replaced the Shore Scleroscope in terms both of accuracy and adaptability.
Table 2.3 gives representative hardness numbers, together with other
mechanical properties, for some of the better-known metals and alloys.

Fig. 2.11 The Avery-Denison Universal impact-testing machine.
This machine can be used for either Charpy or Izod impact tests. For Izod tests, the
pendulum is released from the lower position, to give a striking energy of 170 J; and for the
Charpy test it is released from the upper position, to give a striking energy of 300 J. (The
scale carries a set of graduations for each test.) The machine can also be used for
impact-tension tests.
Impact Tests
2.50 Impact tests indicate the behaviour of a material under conditions
of mechanical shock and to some extent measure its toughness. Brittleness
—and consequent lack of reliability—resulting from incorrect heat-
treatment (13.42) or other causes may not be revealed during a tensile test
but will usually be evident in an impact test.
2.51 The Izod Impact Test In this test a standard notched specimen
is held in a vice and a heavy pendulum, mounted on ball bearings, is
allowed to strike the specimen after swinging from a fixed height. The
striking energy of 167 J (120 ft lbf) is partially absorbed in breaking the
specimen and, as the pendulum swings past, it carries a pointer to its
highest point of swing, thus indicating the amount of energy used in fractur-
ing the test piece.

2.52 The Charpy Test, developed originally on the Continent but now
gaining favour in Britain, employs a test piece mounted as a simply-
supported beam instead of in the cantilever form used in the Izod test (Fig.
2.12). The striking energy is 300 J (220 ft lbf).
2.53 To set up stress concentrations which ensure that fracture does
occur, test pieces are notched. It is essential that notches always be stan-
dard, for which reason a standard gauge is used to test the dimensional
accuracy of the notch. Fig. 2.12 shows standard notched test pieces for
both the Izod and Charpy impact tests.
Fig. 2.12 Dimensions of standard test pieces for both Izod and Charpy tests.
In the Izod test piece, notches 28mm apart may be cut in three different faces so that a more
representative value is obtained.
2.54 The results obtained from impact tests are not always easy to
interpret, and some metals which are ductile under steady loads behave as
brittle materials in an impact test. As mentioned above, however, the
impact test gives a good indication of how reliable the material is likely to
be under conditions of mechanical shock. These tests are most likely to be
specified for constructional steels of medium-carbon content.
Other Destructive Tests
2.60 These are often designed specifically for the measurement of some
property peculiar to a single class of material or to assess the suitability of
a material for a special purpose.
2.61 The Erichsen Cupping Test (11.54-Pt. II) is closely connected
with the ductility of a material but is in fact designed to assess its deep-
drawing properties.
2.62 Compression Tests are used to measure the capability of a cast
iron to carry compressive loads. A standard test cylinder is tested in com-
pression, usually employing a tensile testing machine running in 'reverse'.

materials in wire and rod form.

Non-destructive Tests
2.70 The mechanical tests already mentioned are of a destructive nature
and are subject to the availability of separate test pieces which are reason-
ably representative of the production material. Thus, wrought products
such as rolled strip, extruded rod and drawn wire are generally uniform in
mechanical properties throughout a large batch and can be sampled with
confidence. Parts which are produced individually, however, such as cast-
ings and welded joints, may vary widely in quality purely because they are
made individually and under the influence of many variable factors. If the
quality of such components is important and the expense justified—as in
the case of aircraft castings—it may be necessary to test each component
individually by some form of non-destructive test. Such tests seek to detect
faults and flaws either at the surface or below it, and a number of suitable
methods is available in each case.
The Detection of Surface Faults
2.80 It is often possible to detect and evaluate surface faults by simple
visual examination with or without the use of a hand magnifier. The pres-
ence of fine hair-line cracks is less easy to detect by visual means and some
aid is generally necessary. Such surface cracks may be associated with
the heat-treatment of steel or, in a welded joint, with contraction during
cooling.
2.81 Penetrant Methods In these methods the surface to be examined
is cleaned and then dried. A penetrant fluid is then sprayed or swabbed
on the surface which should be warmed to about 900C. After sufficient
time has elapsed for the penetrant to fill any fissures which may be present
the excess is flushed from the surface with warm water (the surface tension
of the water is too high to allow it to enter the narrow fissure). The test
surface is then carefully dried, coated with fine powdered chalk and set
aside for some time. As the coated surface cools, it contracts and penetrant
tends to be squeezed out of any cracks, so that the chalk layer becomes
stained, thus revealing the presence of the cracks. Most penetrants of this
type contain a scarlet dye which renders the stain immediately noticeable.
Aluminium alloy castings are often examined in this way.
Penetrants containing a compound which fluoresces under the action of
ultra-violet light may also be used. This renders the use of messy chalk
unnecessary. When the prepared surface is illuminated by ultra-violet light,
the cracks containing the penetrant are revealed as bright lines on a dark
background. Penetrant methods are particularly useful for the examination
of non-ferrous metals and austenitic (non-magnetic) steels.
2.82 Magnetic Dust Methods consist in laying the steel component
across the arms of a magnetising machine and then sprinkling it with a
special magnetic powder. The excess powder is blown away, and any cracks
or defects are then revealed by a bunch of powder sticking to the area on

Fig. 2.13 The penetrant method of crack detection.
(i) The cleaned surface is coated with penetrant which seeps into any cracks present, (ii)

each side of the crack. Since the crack lies across the magnetic field, lines of
force will become widely separated at the air gap (Fig. 2.14) and magnetic
particles will align themselves along the lines of force.
Fig. 2.14 The principles of magnetic particle crack detection.
The Detection of Internal Defects
2.90 Internal cavities in the form of blow holes or shrinkage porosity may
be present in castings of all types, whilst wrought materials may contain
slag inclusion and other subcutaneous flaws. Welded joints, by the nature
of their production methods, may contain any of these defects. Since metals
are opaque to light, other forms of electromagnetic radiation of shorter
wavelength (X-rays and y-rays) must be used to penetrate metals and so
reveal such internal discontinuities. Although the railway wheeltapper was,
for some obscure reason, always 'good for a laugh' at the mercy of the
professional comedian, he was in fact using a 'sonic' method of testing the
continuity of structure of the wheel and modern sophisticated methods of
ultra-sonic testing use similar principles.
2.91 X-ray Methods X-rays are used widely in metallurgical research
in order to investigate the nature of crystal structures in metals and alloys.
Their use is not confined to the research laboratory, however, and many
firms use X-rays in much the same way as they are used in medical radiogra-
phy, that is, for the detection of cavities, flaws and other discontinuities in
castings, welded joints and the like.

X-rays are produced when a stream of high-velocity electrons impinges
on a metal target. Fig. 2.15 illustrates the principle of an X-ray tube in
which a filament supplies free electrons. Being negatively charged these
electrons are accelerated away from the cathode towards the anode (some-
times called the 'anti-cathode') by the high potential difference between
the electrodes. Collision with the anode produces X-rays. The containing
tube is under vacuum, as the presence of gas molecules would obstruct the
passage of relatively small electrons. Nevertheless only about 1% of the
energy expended produces X-rays the remainder being converted to heat.
Consequently the anode must be water-cooled. For greater output of
X-rays (above 1 MeV) other types of generator such as the 'linear gener-
ator' or 'Linac' have to be used.
Fig. 2.15 Radiography of a casting using X-rays.
The penetrating power of electromagnetic radiation generally, depends
upon its frequency. Thus radiation at the ultra-violet end of the visible
spectrum will penetrate our skin to a depth of less than 1 mm but will
nevertheless produce painful radiation burns (and possibly skin cancer) if
we sunbathe carelessly. X-rays, having a much higher frequency than UV
light, will penetrate more deeply and the 'harder' the X-rays (ie the higher
the frequency) the greater the depth of penetration. X-rays used in metal-
lurgical radiography are harder than those used in medicine, and are better
able to penetrate metals. At the same time their properties make them
much more dangerous to human body tissue, and plant producing radiation
of this type needs to be carefully shielded in order to prevent the escape
of stray radiations which would seriously impair the health of operators.

Like light, X-rays travel in straight lines, but whilst metals are opaque
to light they are moderately transparent to X-rays, particularly those of
high frequency. Fig. 2.15 illustrates the principle of radiography. A casting
is interposed between a shielded source of X-rays and a photographic film.
Some of the radiation will be absorbed by the metal so that the density of
the photographic image will vary with the thickness of the metal through
which the rays have passed.
2.92 X-rays are absorbed logarithmically—
/ = 
Ioe-*
Where I0 and / are the intensities of incident and emergent radiation
respectively, d the thickness and pi the linear coefficient of absorption of
radiation, (i is lower for radiation of higher frequency.
A cavity in the casting will result in those X-rays which pass through the
cavity being less effectively absorbed than those rays which travel through
the full thickness of metal. Consequently the cavity will show as a dark
patch on the resultant photographic negative in the same way that a greater
intensity of light affects an ordinary photographic negative.
A fluorescent screen may be substituted for the photographic film so
that the resultant radiograph may be viewed instantaneously. This type of
fluoroscopy is obviously much cheaper and quicker but is less sensitive
than photography and its use is generally limited to the less-dense metals
and alloys.
2.93 y-ray Methods can also be used in the radiography of metals. Since
they are of shorter wavelength than are X-rays, they are able to penetrate
more effectively a greater thickness of metal. Hence they are particularly
useful in the radiography of steel, which absorbs radiation more readily
than do light alloys.
2.94 y-rays constitute a major proportion of the dangerous radiation
emanating from 'nuclear waste' and from the fall-out of nuclear explosions.
Initially naturally-occurring radium and radon (18.70) were used as a
source of y-rays but artificially activated isotopes of other elements are
now generally used. These activated isotopes are prepared by bombarding
the element with neutrons in an atomic pile. A nucleus struck by a neutron
absorbs it and then contains an excess of energy which is subsequently
released as y-rays. Commonly used isotopes are shown in Table 2.4. Of
these iridium-192 and cobalt-60 are the most widely used in industry.
2.95 Manipulation of the isotope as a source of y-radiation in metallur-
gical radiography is in many respects more simple than is the case with
X-rays, though security arrangements are extremely important in view of
the facts that y-radiation is 'harder' than X-radiation and that it takes place
continuously from the source without any outside stimulation. All y-ray
sources are controlled remotely, generally using a manual wind-out system
(Fig. 2.16). When not in use the isotope is stored in a shielded container
of some y-ray absorbent material such as lead. Because they are 'harder'
than X-rays, y-rays can be used to radiograph considerable thicknesses of
steel. Since the radiation source is small and compact and needs no external

(i) y-ray source exposed; (ii) y-ray source stored.
power supply, y-radiation equipment is very portable and can be used to
examine materials in situ, eg welded joints in motor-way bridges.
All forms of ionising radiation such as X-rays and y-rays are very harmful
to all living tissue and their use in the UK is governed by the Factories
Act—The Ionisating Radiations (sealed sources) Regulations 1969'.
2.96 Ultra-sonic Methods In marine navigation the old method of
'Swinging the lead' was used to determine the depth of the water under
the boat. This was replaced in the technological age by a 'sonic' method
in which a signal was transmitted from the boat down through the water.
The time interval which elapsed between transmission and reception of the
'echo' was a measure of the depth of the ocean bed. The ultrasonic testing
of metals is somewhat similar in principle. Ordinary sound waves (of fre-
quencies between 30 and 16 000 Hz) tend to bypass the small defects
we are dealing with in metallic components and ultra-sonic frequencies
(between 0.5 and 15 MHz) are used for metals inspection.
When an ultrasonic vibration is transmitted from one medium to another
some reflection occurs at the interface. Any discontinuity in a structure
will therefore provide a reflecting surface for ultrasonic impulses (Fig.
2.17). A probe containing an electrically-excited quartz or barium titanate

The detection of a fault in plate material by ultrasonics.
In (i) the impulse is reflected from the lower surface of the plate; whilst in (ii) it is reflected

reflection of the echo determines the depth of the fault.
crystal which can both transmit and receive high-frequency vibrations is
used to traverse the surface of the material to be examined (Fig. 2.18.).
The probe is coupled to a pulse generator and to a signal amplifier which
transfers the resultant 'image' to a CRT (cathode-ray tube).
2.97 In satisfactory material the pulse will pass from the probe unim-
peded through the metal and be reflected from the lower inside surface at
A back to the probe, then acting as receiver. Both transmitted pulse and
echo are recorded on the CRT and the distance, ti, between peaks is pro-
portional to the thickness, t, of the test piece. If any discontinuity is
encountered such as a blow-hole, B, then the pulse is interrupted and
reflected as indicated. Since the echo returns to the receiver in a shorter
time an intermediate peak appears on the CRT trace. Its position relative
to the other peaks gives an indication of the depth of the fault beneath the
surface.
Fig. 2.18 shows separate crystals being used for transmitter and receiver
but, as mentioned above, in many modern testing devices a single crystal
fulfils both functions. Different types of probe are available for materials
of different thickness and this method is particularly useful for examining
material—such as rolled plate—of uniform thickness.

The Crystalline
Structure of Metals
3.10 All chemical elements can exist as either solids, liquids or gases
depending upon the prevailing conditions of temperature and pressure.
Thus, at atmospheric pressure, oxygen liquifies at — 183°C and solidifies at
—219°C. Similarly, at atmospheric pressure, the metal zinc melts at 419°C
and boils at 9070C. In the gaseous state particles are in a state of constant
motion and the pressure exerted by the gas is due to the impact of these
particles with the walls of the container. As the temperature of the gas is
increased, the velocity of the particles is increased and so the pressure
exerted by the gas increases, assuming that the container does not allow
the gas to expand. If, however, the gas is allowed to expand the distance
apart of the particles increases and so the potential energy increases.
Engineers will understand the term 'potential energy' as being that
energy possessed by a body by virtue of its ability to do work. Similarly,
matter possesses potential energy by virtue of its state. As the distance
apart of particles increases, so the potential energy increases. In fact this
is a simple application of the First Law of Thermodynamics which states
that if a quantity of heat bQ is supplied to a system, part of that heat
energy may be used to increase the internal energy of the system by an
amount bU and part to perform external work by an amount bW. Thus:
SQ = SU+ SW
In this case bW is the work done by the gas as it expands against some
external pressure. Whatever changes occur, energy is conserved.
In a gas such as oxygen the 'particles' referred to are molecules, each of
which consists of two covalently-bonded atoms but in a metallic gas these
particles consist of single atoms since insufficient valence electrons are
available for metallic atoms to be covalently bonded. Each atom has its
own complement of electrons and in the gaseous state the metallic bond
does not exist.

On condensation to a liquid the atoms come into contact with each other
to form bonds (Fig. 3.1), but there is still no orderly arrangement of the
atoms, though a large amount of potential energy is given up in the form
of latent heat. When solidification takes place there is a further discharge
of latent heat, and the potential energy falls even lower as the atoms take
up orderly positions in some geometrical pattern which constitutes a crystal
structure. The rigidity and cohesion of the structure is then due to the
operation of the metallic bond as suggested in (1.76).
Fig. 3.1 
Relative potential energy and atomic arrangements in the three states of matter.
In the gaseous and liquid states these arrangements are disorderly, but in the solid state the
ions conform to some geometrical pattern. (Note that in this diagram ions are indicated thus:
o, whilst valence electrons are indicated so: • , ie the metal is assumed to be bivalent).
3.11 Substances can be classified as either 'amorphous' or 'crystalline'.
In the amorphous state the elementary particles are mixed together in a
disorderly manner, their positions bearing no fixed relationship to those
of their neighbours. The crystalline structure, however, consists of atoms,
or, more properly, ions, arranged according to some regular geometrical
pattern. This pattern varies, as we shall see, from one substance to another.
All metals are crystalline in nature. If a metal, or other crystalline solid,
is stressed below its elastic limit, any distortion produced is temporary and,

when the stress is removed, the solid will return to its original shape. Thus,
removal of stress leads to removal of strain and we say that the substance
is elastic.
The amorphous structure is typical of all liquids in that the atoms or
molecules of which they are composed can be moved easily with respect
to each other, since they do not conform to any fixed pattern. In the case
of liquids of simple chemical formulae in which the molecules are small,
the forces of attraction between these molecules are not sufficient to pre-
vent the liquid from flowing under its own weight; that is, it possesses
high 'mobility'. Many substances, generally regarded as being solids, are
amorphous in nature and rely on the existence of 'long-chain' molecules,
in which all atoms are co-valently bonded, to give them strength as in
certain super polymers (1.75). In these substances the large thread-like
molecules, often containing many thousands of atoms each, are not able
to slide over each other as is the case with relatively simple molecules in
a liquid. The sum of all separate van der Waals' forces of attraction acting
between these large molecules are much greater and, since there will be
considerable mutual entanglement by virtue of their fibrous nature, the
resultant amorphous mass will lack mobility and will be extremely viscous,
or 'plastic'. An amorphous structure, therefore, does not generally possess
elasticity but only plasticity. A notable exception to this statement is pro-
vided by rubber, in which the 'folded' nature of the long-chain molecules
gives rise to elasticity (1.75).
A piece of metal consists of a mass of separate crystals irregular in shape
but interlocking with each other rather like a three-dimensional jig-saw
puzzle. Within each crystal the atoms are regularly spaced with respect to
one another. The state of affairs at the crystal boundaries has long been a
subject for conjecture, but it is now widely held that in these regions there
exists a film of metal, some three atoms thick, in which the atoms do not
conform to any pattern (Fig. 3.2). This crystal boundary film is in fact of
an amorphous nature. The metallic bond acts within and across this crystal
boundary. Consequently, the crystal boundary is not necessarily an area
of weakness except at high temperatures when inter-atomic distances
increase, and so bond strength decreases. Thus at high temperatures metals
are more likely to fail by fracture following the crystal boundaries, whilst
at low temperatures failure by transcrystalline fracture is common.
3.12 When a pure liquid solidifies into a crystalline solid, it does so at
a fixed temperature called the freezing point. During the crystallisation
process the atoms assume positions according to some geometrical pattern
(Fig. 3.1), and whilst this is taking place, heat (the latent heat of solidifi-
cation) is given out in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics, with-
out any fall in temperature taking place. A typical cooling curve for a pure
metal is shown in Fig. 3.3.
3.13 Atoms are very small entities indeed, and it has been calculated
that approximately 85 000 000 000 000 000 000 atoms are contained in
1 mm3 of copper. Thus an individual copper atom measures approximately
2.552 x 10~10 m in diameter, putting it far beyond the range of an ordinary
optical microscope with its maximum magnification of only 2000. However,

modern high-resolution electron microscopes, capable of magnifications of
a million or so, can show planes of atoms in metals; whilst field-ion
microscopy producing magnifications of several millions reveals individual
atoms in the structures of some metals.

We have said that the atoms in a solid metal are arranged according to
some geometrical pattern. How, then, was this fact ascertained and what
form do these patterns take?
Little work was possible in this direction until in 1911 Max von Laue
employed X-rays in an initial study of the structures of crystals. Since
then, X-rays have found an increasing application in the study of crystal
structures, including those of metals. When a beam of monochromatic*
X-rays is directed as a narrow 'pencil' at a specimen of the metal in ques-
tion, diffraction takes place at certain of the crystallographic planes. The
resultant 'image' is recorded on a photographic film as a series of spots,
and an interpretation of the patterns produced leads to a reconstruction of
the original crystal structure of the metal. One such method, that of 'back
reflection', is shown in Fig. 3.4. Other methods are in use, but only this
brief mention is possible here.
Fig. 3.4 
The Laue back-reflection method used to determine the lattice structure of a metal
by X-ray diffraction.
3.14 There are several types of pattern or space lattice in which metallic
atoms can arrange themselves on solidification, but the three most common
are shown in Fig. 3.5. Of these the hexagonal close-packed represents the
closest packing which is possible with atoms. It is the sort of arrangement
obtained when one set of snooker balls is allowed to fall in position on top
of a set already packed in the triangle. (This is illustrated at the top right-
hand corner of Fig. 3.5.) The face-centred cubic arrangement is also a
close packing of the atoms, but body-centred cubic is relatively 'open'; and
when, as sometimes happens, a metal changes its crystalline form as the
temperature is raised or lowered, there is a noticeable change in volume
of the body of metal. An element which can exist in more than one crystal-
line form in this way is said to be polymorphic^. Thus pure iron can exist
in three separate crystalline forms, which are designated by letters of the
Greek alphabet: 'alpha' (a), 'gamma' (y) and 'delta' (8). a-iron, which is
body-centred cubic and exists at normal temperatures, changes to y-iron,
which is face-centred cubic, when heated to 9100C. At 14000C the face-

the term 'allotropic' is used to describe those which occur in different forms which are not necessarily
crystalline.

centred cubic structure reverts to body-centred cubic 6-iron. (The essential
difference between a-iron and 6-iron, therefore, is only in the temperature
range over which each exists.) These polymorphic changes are accom-
panied by changes in volume-contraction and expansion respectively as
shown in Fig. 3.6(i).
The contraction which takes place as the body-centred cubic structure
changes to face-centred cubic can be demonstrated with the simple appar-
atus shown in Fig. 3.6(ii). A wire is held taut under a steady load, and an
electric current, sufficient to heat it above the a—» y change point, is passed
through it. As the change point is reached, the instantaneous contraction of
the wire is indicated by a sharp 'kick' of the pointer to the left. As the wire
cools again, when the current is switched off, there is a kick to the right,
accompanied by a brightening of the red glow emitted by the wire. This
brightening is particularly noticeable when the experiment is made in a
darkened room. This indicates that the y —» a change is accompanied by
a liberation of heat energy, known as 'recalescence'. In the actual experi-
ment a steel wire is used for the sake of convenience, since it is more easily

a similar way but at a lower temperature than if a pure iron wire were
used.) It is this polymorphic change in iron which makes possible the
hardening of carbon steels by quenching. Thus, if iron did not chance to
be a polymorphic element, can one imagine that Man would have reached
his present state of technological development? A world without steel is a
prospect difficult to visualise.
3.15 Miller indices The space lattices indicated in Fig. 3.5 represent
the simplest units which can exist in the three main types mentioned. In
actual fact a metallic crystal is built up of a continuous series of these units,
each face of a unit being shared by an adjacent unit. Any atom will belong
to several different crystallographic planes cutting in different directions
through a crystal. In order to be able to specify these planes some system
of reference is required. The system used is that of 'Miller indices'.
These are the smallest whole numbers proportional to the reciprocals of
the intercepts which the plane under consideration makes with the three

crystal axes (X, Y and Z). Consider a simple cubic structure (Fig. 3.7).
Each face intersects only one axis so that the intercepts are (1, o°, o°), (<*>,
1, oo) and (oo? oo ? l) respectively. The reciprocals of these numbers are (1,
0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1), and these are the Miller indices of the three
planes coinciding with the three faces of the cube under consideration. For
quick reference they are usually written (100), (010) and (001). The three
opposite faces in each case would have negative signs, eg (100). In Fig.
3.8(i) the plane indicated is represented by Miller indices (110) and that
in Fig. 3.8(ii) by (111). Similarly the Miller indices of the plane shown in
Fig. 3.8(iii) will be derived as follows-
Intercepts: 3, 1, 2
Reciprocals: Vs, 1, Vi
Smallest whole numbers
in the same ratio: 2, 6, 3
Hence the Miller indices are (263).
In order to define planes in hexagonal structures more simply a fourth
index is introduced as compared with ordinary Miller indices and the result-
ant indices are termed Miller-Bravais indices. The system is indicated in
Fig. 3.9 in which the axes w, x and y on the basal plane of the hexagon
are at 120° to each other and normal to the z axis. The intercepts of the
plane indicated are oo, oo? oo and 1 and the Miller-Bravais indices will
therefore be (0001).
3.16 Coordination Number As mentioned earlier and illustrated in
Fig. 3.5 both hexagonal close-packed and face-centred cubic represent
crystal structures in which atoms (or ions) are the most closely packed,
whilst in the body-centred cubic structure atoms (or ions) are packed rela-
tively loosely. If we refer to the upper part of Fig. 3.5 we see that the
central atom in the HCP structure is touched by six nearest neighbours on
the same plane, also by three (shown in broken line) on the plane above,
as well as by three on a similar plane below; making a total of twelve
nearest neighbours, ie all 'touching' the central atom. This total, twelve,
is known as the coordination number of the HCP lattice.
In the FCC structure the central atom has four nearest neighbours on
the same plane, four (shown in broken line) on the plane above and four

Fig. 3.9.
in similar positions on the plane below. Again the total, twelve, is the
coordination number of the FCC lattice structure. In the BCC structure
however the central atom (in broken line) has only eight nearest neigh-
bours—four on the plane above and four on the plane below—so that its
coordination number is eight.
Only one metal, polonium, is known to crystallise in simple cubic form,
ie with one atom at each corner of a cube. Here any atom is touched
by six nearest neighbours so that this very loose packing of atoms has a
coordination number of only six. Hence it will be seen that the coordination
number is an indication of how closely atoms (or ions) are packed in a
crystal structure.
3.17 When a pure metal solidifies, each crystal begins to form indepen-
dently from a nucleus or 'centre of crystallisation'. The nucleus will be a
simple unit of the appropriate crystal lattice, and from this the crystal will
grow. The crystal develops by the addition of atoms according to the lattice
pattern it will follow, and rapidly begins to assume visible proportions in
what is called a 'dendrite' (Gk 'dendron', a tree). This is a sort of crystal
skeleton, rather like a backbone from which the arms begin to grow in
other directions, depending upon the lattice pattern. From these secondary
arms, tertiary arms begin to sprout, somewhat similar to the branches and
twigs of a fir-tree. In the metallic dendrite, however, these branches and
twigs conform to a rigid geometrical pattern. A metallic crystal grows in
this way because heat is dissipated more quickly from a point, so that it will
be there that the temperature falls most quickly leading to the formation of
a rather elongated skeleton (Fig. 3.10).

Dendritic growth.
This iron dendrite grew from a nucleus at 'n' in a molten mixture of iron and copper. After
all the available iron had been used up the dendrite ceased to grow, and the molten copper
solidified as the matrix in which the iron dendrite remains embedded. (In fact the iron dendrite
will contain a little dissolved copper—in 'solid solution'—whilst the copper matrix will contain
a very small amount of dissolved iron), x 300..
HEAT DISSIPATION
AND CRYSTAL GROWTH
Fig. 3.10 The early stages in the growth of a metallic dendrite.

The dendrite arms continue to grow and thicken at the same time, until
ultimately the space between them will become filled with solid. Meanwhile
the outer arms begin to make contact with those of neighbouring dendrites
which have been developing quite independently at the same time. All
these neighbouring crystals will be orientated differently due to their inde-
pendent formation; that is, their lattices will meet at odd angles. When
contact has taken place between the outer arms of neighbouring crystals
further growth outwards is impossible, and solidification will be complete
when the remaining liquid is used up in thickening the existing dendrite
arms. Hence the independent formation of each crystal leads to the irregu-
lar overall shape of crystals. The dendritic growth of crystals is illustrated
in Fig. 3.11. In these diagrams, however, the major axes of the crystals
are all shown in the same horizontal plane, ie the plane of the paper,
whereas in practice this would not necessarily be the case. It has been
shown so in the illustration for the sake of clarity.
Fig. 3.11 
The dendritic growth of metallic crystals from the liquid state.
A solid pure metal (D) gives no hint of its dendritic origin since all atoms are identical, but
an impure metal (E) carries the impurities between the dendritic arms, thus revealing the
initial skeleton.
3.18 If the metal we have been considering is pure we shall see no
evidence whatever of dendritic growth once solidification is complete, since
all atoms are identical. Dissolved impurities, however, will often tend to
remain in the molten portion of the metal as long as possible, so that they
are present in that part of the metal which ultimately solidifies in the spaces
between the dendrite arms. Since their presence will often cause a slight
alteration in the colour of the parent metal, the dendritic structure will be
revealed on microscopical examination. The areas containing impurity will
appear as patches between the dendrite arms (Fig. 3.11E). Inter-dendritic
porosity may also reveal the original pattern of the dendrites to some

extent. If the metal is cooled too rapidly during solidification, molten metal
is often unable to 'feed' effectively into the spaces which form between the
dendrites due to the shrinkage which accompanies freezing. These spaces
then remain as cavities following the outline of the solid dendrite. Such
shrinkage cavities can usually be distinguished from blow-holes formed by
dissolved gas. The former are of distinctive shape and occur at the crystal
boundaries, whilst the latter are quite often irregular in form and occur at
any point in the crystal structure (Fig. 3.12).
Fig. 3.12 
Porosity in cast metals.
Shrinkage cavities (A) tend to follow the shape of the dendritic arms and occur at the crystal
boundaries, whilst gas porosity (B) is usually of irregular shape and occurs at almost any
point in the structure.
3.19 The rate at which a molten metal is cooling when it reaches its
freezing point affects the size of the crystals which form. A slow fall in
temperature, which leads to a small degree of undercooling at the onset
of solidification, promotes the formation of relatively few nuclei, so that
the resultant crystals will be large (they are easily seen without the aid of
a microscope). Rapid cooling, on the other hand, leads to a high degree
of undercooling being attained, and the onset of crystallisation results in
the formation of a large 'shower' of nuclei. This can only mean that the
final crystals, being large in number, are small in size. In the language of
the foundry, 'chilling causes fine-grain casting'. (Throughout this book the
term 'grain' and 'crystal' are used synonymously.) Thus the crystal size of a
pressure die-casting will be very small compared with that of a sand-casting.
Whilst the latter cools relatively slowly, due to the insulating properties of
the sand mould, the former solidifies very quickly, due to the contact of
the molten metal with the metal mould. Similarly, thin sections, whether
in sand- or die-casting, will lead to a relatively quicker rate of cooling, and
consequently smaller crystals.
In a large ingot the crystal size may vary considerably from the outside
surface to the centre (Fig. 3.13). This is due to the variation which exists

These roughly follow the shape of the original dendrites and occur in that part of the alloy

in the temperature gradient as the ingot solidifies and heat is transferred
from the metal to the mould. When metal first makes contact with the
mould the latter is cold, and this has a chilling effect which results in the
formation of small crystals at the surface of the ingot. As the mould warms
up, its chilling effect is reduced, so that the formation of nuclei will be
retarded as solidification proceeds. Thus crystals towards the centre of the
ingot will be larger. In an intermediate position the rate of cooling is
favourable to the formation of elongated columnar crystals, so that we are
frequently able to distinguish three separate zones in the crystal structure
of an ingot, as shown in Fig. 3.13. More recent research into rapid solidifi-
cation processes (RSP) has been carried out with the object of obtaining
metals and alloys with extremely tiny crystals, and in some cases retaining
the amorphous structure of the original liquid at ambient temperatures
(9.110).
A number of defects can occur in cast structures. The more important
are dealt with below.
Fig. 3.13 
The crystal structure in a section of a large ingot.
Blow-holes
3.20 These are caused by furnace gases which have dissolved in the metal
during melting, or by chemical reactions which have taken place in the
melt. Gas which has dissolved freely in the molten metal will be much less
soluble in the solid metal. Therefore, as the metal solidifies, gas will be
forced out of solution. Since dendrites have already formed, the bubbles
of expelled gas become trapped by the dendrite arms and are prevented
from rising to the surface. Most aluminium alloys and some of the copper
alloys are susceptible to 'gassing' of this type, caused mainly by hydrogen
dissolved from the furnace atmosphere. The difficulty can be overcome
only by making sure that there is no dissolved gas in the melt prior to
casting (1.54 and 1.60—Part II).

oxidised prior to being cast. Any iron oxide (present as oxygen ions) in the
molten steel will tend to be reduced by carbon according to the following
equation:
FeO + C ^± Fe + CO
This is what is commonly called a reversible reaction and the direction in
which the resultant reaction proceeds depends largely upon the relative
concentrations of the reactants and also upon the temperature. When
carbon (in the form of anthracite for example) is added to the molten steel
the reaction proceeds strongly to the right and since carbon monoxide, a
gas, is lost to the system the reaction continues until very little FeO remains
in equilibrium with the relatively large amount of carbon present. As the
ingot begins to solidify, it is almost pure iron of which the initial dendrites
are composed. This causes an increase in the concentration of carbon and
the oxide, FeO, in the remaining molten metal, thus upsetting chemical
equilibrium so that the above reaction will commence again. The bubbles
of carbon monoxide formed are trapped by the growing dendrites, produc-
ing blow-holes. The formation of blow-holes of this type is prevented by
adequate 'killing' of the steel before it is cast—that is, by adding a suf-
ficiency of a deoxidising agent such as ferromanganese. This removes
residual FeO and prevents the FeO-C reaction from occurring during sub-
sequent solidification. In some cases the FeO-C reaction is utilised as in
the production of 'rimmed' ingots (2.21—Part II).
3.22 Subcutaneous blow-holes, ie those just beneath the surface may
be caused in ingots by the decomposition of oily mould dressing, particu-
larly when this collects in the fissures of badly cracked mould surfaces. The
gas formed forces its way into the partially solid surface of the metal ingot,
producing extensive porosity.
Shrinkage
3.30 The crystalline structure of most metals of engineering importance
represent a close packing of atoms. Consequently solid metals occupy less
space than they do as liquids and shrinkage takes place during solidification
as a result of this decrease in volume. If the mould is of a design such that
isolated pockets of liquid remain when the outside surface of the casting
is solid, shrinkage cavities will form. Hence the mould must be so designed
that there is always a 'head' of molten metal which solidifies last and can
therefore 'feed' into the main body of the casting as it solidifies and shrinks.
Shrinkage is also responsible for the effect known as 'piping' in cast ingots.
Consider the ingot mould (Fig. 3.14A) filled instantaneously with molten
steel. That metal which is adjacent to the mould surface solidifies almost
immediately, and as it does so it shrinks. This causes the level of the
remaining metal to fall slightly, and as further solidification takes place the
process is repeated, the level of the remaining liquid falling still further.
This sequence of events continues to be repeated until the metal is com-

pletely solid and a conical cavity or 'pipe' remains in the top portion of
the ingot. With an ingot shaped as shown it is likely that a secondary pipe
would be formed due to the shrinkage of trapped molten metal when it
solidifies. It is usually necessary to shape large ingots in the way shown in
Fig. 3.14A, that is, small end upwards, so that the mould can be lifted
from the solidified ingot. Therefore various methods of minimising the
pipe must be used (2.21—Part II). One of the most important of these
methods is to pour the metal into the mould so that solidification almost
keeps pace with pouring. In this way molten metal feeds into the pipe
formed by the solidification and consequent shrinkage of the metal. Smaller
ingots can be cast into moulds which taper in the opposite direction to that
shown in Fig. 3.14A, ie large end upwards (Fig. 3.14B), since these can
be trunnion-mounted to make ejection of the ingot possible.

Segregation of Impurities
3.40 There is a tendency for dissolved impurities to remain in that portion
of the metal which solidifies last. The actual mechanism of this type of
solidification will be dealt with later (8.23), and it will be sufficient here to
consider its results.
3.41 The dendrites which form first are of almost pure metal, and this
will mean that the impurities become progressively more concentrated in
the liquid which remains. Hence the metal which freezes last at the crystal
boundaries contains the bulk of the impurities which were dissolved in the
original molten metal. This local effect is known as minor segregation (Fig.
3.15A).

Types of segregation which may be encountered in steel ingots.
3.42 As the columnar crystals begin to grow inwards, they will push in
front of them some of the impurities which were dissolved in the molten
metal from which they themselves solidified. In this way there is a tendency
for much of the impurities in the original melt to become concentrated in
the central pipe. If a vertical section of an ingot is polished and etched,
these impurities show as V-shaped markings in the area of the pipe (Fig.
3.15B). The effect is called major segregation.
3.43 With very large ingots the temperature gradient may become very
slight towards the end of the solidification process, and it is common for
the band of metal which has become highly charged with impurities,
just in front of the advancing columnar crystals, to solidify last. Some
impurities, when dissolved in a metal, will depress its freezing point con-
siderably (similarly when lead is added to tin a low melting point solder is
produced). Hence the thin band of impure metal just in advance of the
growing columnar crystals has a much lower freezing point than the rela-
tively pure molten metal at the centre. Since the temperature gradient is
slight, this metal at the centre may begin to solidify in the form of equi-axed
crystals, so that the impure molten metal is trapped in an intermediate
position. This impure metal therefore solidifies last, causing inverted
V-shaped markings to appear in the etched section of such an ingot. It is
known as 'inverse-vee' segregation (Fig. 3.15C). Rimming steels contain
no heavily-segregated areas because of the mechanical stirring action intro-
duced by the evolution of carbon monoxide during the FeO/C reaction
(3.21).

3.44 Of these three types of segregation, minor segregation is probably
the most deleterious in its effect, since it will cause overall brittleness of
the castings and, depending upon the nature of the impurity, make an ingot
hot- or cold-short, that is, liable to crumble during hot- or cold-working
processes.
3.50 From the foregoing remarks it will be evident that a casting, suf-
fering as it may from so many different types of defect, is one of the more
variable and least predictable of metallurgical structures. In some cases we
can detect the presence of blow-holes and other cavities by the use of
X-rays, but other defects may manifest themselves only during subsequent
service. Such difficulties are largely overcome when we apply some mech-
anical working process during which such defects, if serious, will become
apparent by the splitting or crumbling of the material undergoing treat-
ment. At the same time a mechanical working process will give a product
of greater uniformity in so far as structure and mechanical properties are
concerned. Thus, all other things being equal, a forging is likely to be more
reliable in service than a casting. Sometimes, however, such factors as
intricate shape and cost of production dictate the choice of a casting. We
must then ensure that it is of the best possible quality.
Line and Points Defects in Crystals
3.60 In the foregoing sections we have been dealing with such defects as
are likely to occur in cast metals. These defects may be so large that a
microscope is not necessary to examine them. Others are small yet still
within the range of a simple optical microscope. On the atomic scale how-
ever metallic structures which would be regarded as being of very high
quality in the industrial sense nevertheless consist of crystals which contain
numerous 'line' and 'points' defects scattered throughout the crystal lattice.
These defects (Fig. 3.16) occur in wrought as well as in cast metals and
though small in dimensions have considerable influence on mechanical
properties.
3.61 The most important line defect is the dislocation. Here part of a
plane of atoms is missing from the lattice, and the 'glide' of this fault
through a crystal under the action of a shearing force is the mechanism by
which metals can be deformed mechanically without fracture taking place
(4.15).
3.62 Of the various points defects occurring in crystals the term vacancy
describes a lattice site from which the atom is missing. When such a vacancy
is formed by the resident atom migrating to the surface of the metal it is
known as a Schottky defect (8.24). If a number of vacancies occur near to
each other, stress within the lattice will be reduced if these vacancies diffuse
together to form a void. Such voids are likely to precipitate the formation
of cracks when the lattice is subjected to sufficient stress. A Frenkel defect
is caused by the displacement of an atom from its lattice position into a
nearby interstitial site.
To the mind not scientifically trained the term 'solution' suggests only

that some solid substance has been dissolved by a liquid, but in science a
solution is a homogeneous mixture of two (or more) substances in which
the atoms or molecules of the substances are completely dispersed—
whether in the gaseous, liquid or solid states. Thus in metals a solid solution
(8.20) consists of a crystal structure in which 'stranger' atoms take up
positions within the lattice of the parent metal.
In a substitutional solid solution (8.21) some lattice sites are occupied by
'stranger' atoms (Fig. 3.16), that is, they are substituted for some of the
atoms of the parent metal. Such stranger atoms are generally of a similar
size—either larger or smaller—to those of the parent metal. If the stranger
atoms are smaller than those of the parent metal they are quite likely to
dissolve interstitially, that is they fit into the spaces (or interstices) between
the parent atoms forming an interstitial solid solution. The very small atoms
of hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen are able to dissolve interstitially even in
solid y-iron, the latter two elements making the processes of carburising
and nitriding possible.
3.63 Whatever the nature of a points defect it is likely to stop or at
least impede the smooth movement of dislocations through a crystal so
that a greater force must be used to produce a new movement of dislo-
cations. For this reason solid solutions are stronger than pure metals.

Mechanical 
Deformation
and Recovery
4.10 Deformation in metals can occur either by elastic movement or by
plastic flow (2.30). In elastic deformation a limited distortion of the crystal
lattice is produced, but the atoms do not move permanently from their
ordered positions, and as soon as the stress is removed the distortion
disappears. When a metal is stressed beyond the elastic limit plastic defor-
mation takes place and there must, clearly, be some movement of the
atoms into new positions, since considerable permanent distortion is pro-
duced. We must therefore consider ways in which this extensive rearrange-
ment of atoms within the lattice structure can take place to give rise to this
permanent deformation.
4.11 Plastic deformation proceeds in metals by a process known as
'slip', that is, by one layer or plane of atoms gliding over another. Imagine
a pile of pennies as representing a single metallic crystal. If we apply any
force which has a horizontal component, ie any force not acting vertically,
the pile of pennies will be sheared as one slides over another, provided
that the horizontal component is sufficient to overcome friction between
the pennies.
The results of slip in a polycrystalline mass of metal may be observed
by microscopical examination. The direction of the slip planes is indicated
in such a piece of metal after deformation by the presence of slip bands
which form on the surface of the metal. If a piece of soft iron is polished
and etched and then squeezed in a vice so that the polished surface is not
scratched, these slip bands can be seen on the surface. Their method of
formation is indicated in Fig. 4.2. Such slip bands are generally parallel in
any individual crystal but differ in orientation from one crystal to another.
It has been shown by electron microscopy that a single visible slip band
consists of a group of roughly 10 steps on the surface, each about 40 atoms
thick and approximately 400 atoms high. If the deformation has been
excessive, the presence of slip bands is apparent even when a specimen is

polished and etched after deformation. Heavily stressed parts of the crystal
—which contain considerable strain energy—dissolve more quickly during
etching, revealing these so-called 'strain bands'.
4.12 All metals of similar crystal structure slip on the same crystallo-
graphic planes and in the same crystallographic directions. Slip occurs
when the shear stress resolved along these planes reaches a certain value
—the critical resolved shear stress. This is a property of the material and
does not depend upon the structure. The process of slip is facilitated by
the presence of the metallic bond, since there is no need to break direct
bonds between individual atoms as there is in co-valent or electro-valent
structures, nor is there the problem of repulsion of ions of like charge as

there is for an electro-valently bonded crystal. When slip occurs in co-
valent or electro-valent structures it does so with much greater difficulty
than in metals. Some types of crystal are more amenable to deformation
by slip than others. For example, in the face-centred cubic type of structure
there are a number of different planes along which slip could conceivably
take place, whereas with the hexagonal close-packed structure slip is only
possible on the basal plane of the hexagon. Thus, metals with a face-
centred cubic structure, such as copper, aluminium and gold, are far more
malleable and ductile than metals with a hexagonal close-packed lattice
like zinc.
4.13 It is possible, under controlled conditions, to grow single crystals
of some metals, and under application of adequate stress such crystals
behave in a manner very similar to that of the pile of pennies. An offset
on one side of the crystal is balanced by similar offset on the other side
(Fig. 4.3), and both offsets lie on a single continuous plane called a slip
plane. Whilst in the case of the pile of pennies the force necessary to cause
slip was that required to overcome friction between them, in a single
metallic crystal the force necessary to cause slip is related to that required
to overcome the resistance afforded by the metallic bond.
For a single crystal the shear component, T (Fig. 4.4) of a tensile stress,
a, resolved along the direction of slip, OS7 on a slip plane, F, can be
calculated. ON is normal to P.

Component of a along OS = a.cos (3

Experiments show that different single crystals of the same metal slip at
different angles and different tensile stresses, but if the stresses are resolved
along the slip plane, all crystals of the same metal slip at the same critical
value of resolved shear stress.
4*14 From a knowledge of the forces acting within the metallic bond
it is possible to derive a theoretical value for the stress required to produce
slip by the simultaneous movement of atoms along a plane in a metallic
crystal. However, the stress, T, actually obtained practically in experiments
on single crystals as outlined above, is only about one thousandth of the
theoretical value assuming simultaneous slip by all atoms on the plane.
Obviously then slip cannot be a simple simultaneous block movement of
one layer of atoms over another. Nor does such a simple interpretation
of the idea of slip explain the work-hardening which takes place during
mechanical deformation. A perfect material in plastic deformation would
presumably deform without limit at a constant yield stress as indicated in
Fig. 4.5A, but in practice a stress-strain relationship of the type indicated
in Fig. 4.5B exists.
4.15 Earlier theories which sought to explain slip by the simultaneous
gliding of a complete block of atoms over another have now been discarded
and the modern conception is that slip occurs step by step by the movement
of so-called 'dislocations' within the crystal.
If the reader has ever tried his hand at paper-hanging he will know that
wrinkles have a habit of appearing in the paper when it is laid on the wall.
Attempts to smooth out these wrinkles by pulling on the edge of the paper
would undoubtedly prove fruitless, since the tensile force necessary to
cause the whole sheet of paper to slide would be so great as to tear it.

Instead, gentle coaxing of the wrinkles individually with the aid of a brush
or cloth leads to their successful elimination, causing them to glide and
'pass out of the system', with the application of a force which is small
compared with that necessary to slide the whole sheet of paper simul-
taneously. The movement of dislocations on a slip plane in a metallic
crystal probably follows a similar pattern.
Dislocations are faults or distorted regions (Fig. 4.6) in otherwise perfect

crystals and the step-by-step movement of such faults explains why the
force necessary to produce slip is of the order of 1000 times less than the
theoretical, assuming simultaneous slip over a whole plane.
The fundamental nature of a dislocation is illustrated in Fig. 4.7 (in
which for the sake of clarity only the centres of atoms are indicated).
Assume that a shearing stress, a, has been applied to the crystal causing
the top half, APSE, of the face, ADHE, to move inwards on a slip plane,
PQRS, by an amount PPi (one atomic step). There has been no corre-
sponding slip, however, at face BCGF. Consequently the top half of the
crystal contains an extra half-plane as compared with the bottom part of
length PiQ. In Fig. 4.7 this is the half-plane WXYZ and the line XY is
known as an edge dislocation. It separates the slipped part PXYS of the
slip plane from the unslipped part XQRY. During slip this 'front' XY
moves to the right through the crystal.
The movement of such an edge dislocation under the action of a shearing
force is illustrated in Fig. 4.8. Here an edge dislocation exists already (i),
and the application of the shearing stress (ii) causes the dislocation to glide
along the slip plane in the manner suggested. In this case it has been
assumed that the dislocation glides out of the crystal completely, producing
a slip step of one atom width at the edge of the crystal (iii). The dislocation
can be moved through the crystal with relative ease, since only one plane
is moving at a time and then only through a small distance.
Slip can also take place by the movement of 'screw' dislocations. These
differ from edge dislocations in that the direction of movement of the
dislocation is normal to the direction of formation of the slip step. The

mechanism of the process is indicated in Fig. 4.9. Here a shear stress, o,
had displaced P to P\ and Q to Qi on one face of the crystal so that
PiQiYX has slipped relative to PQYX. In this case the screw dislocation
XY separates the slipped part PQYX from the unslipped part XYRS of
the slip plane PQRS. It will be noted that XY is moving in a direction
which is normal to the direction in which slip is being produced.
It is also possible for slip to take place by the combination of a screw
dislocation with an edge dislocation. A curved dislocation is thus evolved
which moves across the slip plane (Fig. 4.10).
4.16 Until comparatively recently much of the foregoing commentary
concerning dislocations was of a speculative nature. Whilst many of the
properties of a metal could be best explained by postulating the existence
of dislocations, no one had actually seen a dislocation in a metallic structure
since dimensions approaching atomic size are involved. True, dislocations
had been observed in structures of crystalline complex compounds and it
was reasonable to suppose that similar dislocations occurred in the crystal-
line structures of metals. During the last few years the rapid development
of electron microscope techniques has made it possible to observe crystallo-
graphic planes within metallic structures. With the aid of high-resolution
electron microscopy, photographs of edge dislocations in metals such as
aluminium have been produced (Fig. 4.6(ii)).
Since the stress required to produce dislocations is great, it is assumed
that they are not generally initiated by stress application but that the major-
ity of them are formed during the original solidification process. During
any subsequent cold-working process, dislocations have a method of repro-
ducing themselves from what are called Frank-Read sources (Fig. 4.11),
so that in the cold-worked metal the number of dislocations has greatly
increased.
The relationship between the force necessary to initiate dislocations and
to move those which already exist is notably demonstrated by the tensile
properties of metallic 'whiskers'. These are hair-like single crystals grown
under controlled conditions and generally having a single dislocation run-
ning along the central axis. If a tensile stress is applied along this axis the
dislocation is unable to slip. As no other dislocations are available, the
crystal cannot yield until a dislocation is initiated at E (Fig. 4.12). The
stress then falls to that necessary to move the dislocation (Y), and dislo-
cations then reproduce rapidly so that plastic flow proceeds.

4.17 A brief mention of experimental evidence supporting the oper-

by which slip can take place in individual crystals. If slip occurred com-

The original source is visualised as a dislocation line anchored at its ends, possibly by other
faults. The action of a suitable shear stress causes the line to bow outwards, ultimately
turning upon itself (iii), and eventually forming a complete dislocation loop (v). Since the
original dislocation line still remains, the process can repeat ad lib producing a series of
dislocation loops or ripples flowing out from the original source.
pletely over a whole plane, as was assumed above, the dislocation would
pass right out of the crystal and there would be no reason for any change
in mechanical properties. Yet, as we know, metals, which have solidified
under ordinary conditions and which consist of a mass of individual
crystals, become harder and stronger as the amount of cold work to which
they are subjected increases, until a point is reached where they ultimately
fracture.

Consequently, it is assumed that many dislocations remain in every
crystal and that increase in hardness results from their mutual interference
and the building up of a transcrystalline 'traffic jam'. Increase in hardness
and strength is due to the greater difficulty in moving new dislocations
against the jammed ones, whilst a 'pile up' of jammed dislocations may
propagate a fracture. Dislocations will be unable to escape at crystal boun-
daries by forming steps because of the adherence of crystals in terms of
the amorphous film (3.11). Moreover, the amorphous film will act as an
effective barrier preventing dislocations from passing from one crystal to
another, even supposing that the lattice structures of two neighbouring
crystals were suitably aligned to make this possible. Since individual
crystals develop at random in a polycrystalline mass, this will rarely be so.
Individual crystals in a polycrystalline metal deform by the same mechan-
isms as do single crystals, but since they are orientated at random, shear
stress on slip planes will attain the critical value in different crystals at
different loads (acting on the metal as a whole). Thus there is considerable
difference between the deformation of a single crystal and that of a polycry-
stalline mass. The yield stress of the latter is generally higher and glide
occurs almost simultaneously on several different systems of slip planes.
Dislocations cannot escape from individual crystals and so they jam. A
'pile up' on one slip plane will prevent dislocations in intersecting planes
from moving, producing a situation not uncommon in the case of motor-
traffic conditions at most crossroads near the South Coast on almost any
Sunday in the summer.
For these reasons, strain-hardening proceeds much more rapidly in a
polycrystalline metal than it does in a single crystal. A decrease in crystal
size leads to strain-hardening taking place more quickly so that, though
the material is stronger, it is less ductile. Strain-hardening, however, is
supremely important. If a metal did not strain-harden but continued to
slip, as would any perfectly plastic material (Fig. 4.5A), failure would be
inevitable, immediately it were loaded above its yield point.

ORDINARY POLY-CRYSTALLINE COPPER

4.18 In addition to deformation by slip, some metals, notably zinc, tin
and iron, deform by a process known as 'twinning'. The mechanism of this
process is illustrated in Fig. 4.13. In deformation by slip all atoms in one
block move the same distance, but in deformation by twinning, atoms in
each successive plane within a block will move different distances, with
the effect of altering the direction of the lattice so that each half of the
crystal becomes a mirror image of the other half along a twinning plane.
It is thought that twinning also proceeds by the movement of dislocations.
Twins thus formed are called 'mechanical twins' to distinguish them from
the 'annealing twins' which are developed in some alloys—notably those
of copper—during an annealing operation which follows mechanical defor-
mation. The mechanical twins formed in iron by shock loading are known
as 'Neumann bands'. Twin formation in a bar of tin can actually be heard
as the bar is bent and used to be called 'The Cry of Tin'.

shearing force P.
Energy of Mechanical Deformation
4.19 As deformation proceeds the metal becomes progressively harder
and stronger and, whether by slip or by twinning, a point is reached when
no more deformation can be produced. Any further increase in the applied
force will lead only to fracture. In this condition, when tensile strength and
hardness have reached a maximum and ductility a minimum, the material is
said to be work hardened. As deformation proceeds the capacity for further
deformation decreases and the force necessary to produce it must increase.
All dislocations present at the start of stress application have moved into
'jammed' positions, as have all new dislocations generated by the progress-
ive increase in stress, until no further slip by movement of dislocations is
possible. At this point of maximum resistance to slip (maximum strength
and hardness) further increase in stress would give rise to fracture. The
material must then be annealed if further cold work is to be carried out
on it.
During a cold-working process approximately 90% of the mechanical
energy employed is converted to heat as internal forces acting within the

PLANES

metal are overcome. The remaining 10% of mechanical energy used is
stored in the material as a form of potential energy. The bulk of this—
about 9% of the energy originally used—is that associated with the number
of dislocations generated. These have energy because they result in distor-
tion of the lattice and cause atoms to occupy positions of higher-than-
minimum energy. The remaining potential energy (1% of the energy
originally used) exists as locked-up residual stresses arising from elastic
strains internally balanced.
The increased-energy state of a cold-worked metal makes it more chemi-
cally active and consequently less resistant to corrosion. It was suggested
earlier in this chapter that as deformation proceeds dislocations will tend
to pile up at crystal boundaries. Consequently these crystal boundaries will
be regions of increased potential energy due to the extra micro-stresses
present there. For this reason the grain-boundary areas will corrode more
quickly than the remainder of the material so that intercrystalline failure
will be accelerated.
This stored potential energy is also the principal driving force of recovery
and recrystallisation during an annealing process.
Annealing and Recrystallisation
4.20 A cold-worked metal is in a state of considerable mechanical stress,
resulting from elastic strains internally balanced. These elastic strains are
due to the jamming of dislocations which occurred during cold defor-
mation. If the cold-worked metal is heated to a sufficiently high tempera-
ture then the total energy available to the distorted regions will make
possible the movement of atoms into positions of equilibrium so that the
elastic strains diminish and the 'locked-up' energy associated with them
'escapes'. Since dislocations will once more be in positions of minimum
energy from which they can be moved relatively easily, tensile strength
and hardness will have fallen to approximately their original values and
the capacity for cold-work will have returned. This form of heat-treatment
is known as annealing, and is made use of when the metal is required for
use in a soft but tough state or, alternatively, when it is to undergo further
cold deformation. Annealing may proceed in three separate stages
depending upon the extent of the required treatment.
4.30 Stage I—The Relief of Stress This occurs at relatively low tem-
peratures at which atoms, none the less, are able to move to positions
nearer to equilibrium in the crystal lattice. Such small movements reduce
local strain and therefore the mechanical stress associated with it, without,
however, producing any visible alteration in the distorted shape of the
cold-worked crystals. Moreover, hardness and tensile strength will remain
at the high value produced by cold-work, and may even increase as shown
in the curve for cold-worked 70-30 brass (Fig. 4.14). It is found that a
controlled low-temperature anneal at, say, 2500C applied to hard-drawn
70-30 brass tube will effectively reduce its tendency to 'season-crack'
(16.33) without reducing strength or hardness.

ANNEALING TEMPERATURE (0C)

4.40 Stage II—Recrystallisation Although a low-temperature
annealing process intended to relieve 'locked-up' stresses may sometimes
be used, annealing generally involves a definite and observable alteration
in the microstructure of the metal or alloy. If the annealing temperature
is increased a point is reached when new crystals begin to grow from nuclei
produced in the deformed metal. These nuclei are formed at points of
high potential energy such as crystal boundaries and other regions where
dislocations have become entangled. The crystals so formed are at first

Plate 4.2 A cast 70-30 brass slab (38mm thick) was being cold-rolled when the mill was
stopped. The partly rolled slab was then annealed at 6000C.
The photomicrograph (A) reveals two regions: (1) the coarse-grained region which suffered
no cold-work and consequently did not recrystallise on annealing (hence it shows the original
coarse as-cast structure); (2) the heavily cold-worked part of the slab which has recrystallised
on annealing so that the crystals are much too small to be visible in the photomicrograph.
The photomicrograph (x 100) (B) is taken from a region which suffered very little cold work.
On annealing, recrystallisation has just begun at points on the original crystal boundaries
where, presumably, a pile-up of dislocations had just commenced. Small twinned crystals
have been formed at these points, whilst the remainder of the structure is still the original
as-cast.

small, but grow gradually until they absorb the entire distorted structure
produced originally by cold-work (Fig. 4.15). The new crystals are equi-
axed in form, that is, they do not show any directional elongation, as did
the distorted cold-worked crystals which they replace. They are, in fact,
of equal axes.
This phenomenon is known as recrystallisation, and it is the principal
method employed, in conjunction with cold-work, of course, to produce a
fine-grained structure in non-ferrous metals and alloys. Only in rare cases
—notably in steels and aluminium bronze, where certain structural changes
take place in the solid state—is it possible to refine the grain size solely by
heat-treatment.
Fig. 4.15 Stages in the recrystallisation of a metal.
(A) Represents the metal in its cold-rolled state. At (B) recrystallisation had commenced with
the formation of new crystal nuclei. These grow at the expense of the old crystals until at (F)
recrystallisation is complete.
4.41 The minimum temperature at which recrystallisation will take
place is called the recrystallisation temperature. This temperature is lowest
for pure metals, and is generally raised by the presence of other elements.
Thus, pure copper recrystallises at 2000C, whilst the addition of 0.5%
arsenic will raise the recrystallisation temperature to well above 5000C; a
useful feature when copper is to be used at high temperatures and must
still retain its mechanical strength. Arsenical copper of this type was widely
used in the boiler tubes and fire-boxes of the steam locomotives of former
years. Similarly, whilst cold-worked commercial-grade aluminium recrys-
tallises in the region of 1500C, that of 'six nines' purity (99.999 9% pure)
appears to recrystallise below room temperature and, consequently, does
not cold-work.

Other metals, for example lead and tin, recrystallise below room tem-
perature, so that it is virtually impossible to cold-work them, since they
recrystallise even whilst mechanical work is taking place. Thus, they can
never be work-hardened at normal temperatures of operation. Most engin-
eering metals have recrystallisation temperatures which are well above
ambient temperatures, and are therefore hot-worked at some temperature
above their recrystallisation temperature.
4.42 The recrystallisation temperature is dependent largely on the
degree of cold-work which the material had previously received, and severe
cold-work will generally result in a lower recrystallisation temperature,
since the greater the degree of cold-work the greater the amount of locked-
up potential energy available for recrystallisation. It is therefore not poss-
ible accurately to quote a recrystallisation temperature for a metal to the
extent that it is for, say, its melting point. For most metals, however,
the recrystallisation temperature is between one-third and one-half of the
melting point temperature, Tm. (Tm being measured on the absolute scale,
K.) Thus the mobilities of all metallic atoms are approximately equal at
the same fraction of their melting point (K).
4.50 Stage III—Grain Growth If the annealing temperature is above
the recrystallisation temperature of the metal, the newly formed crystals
will continue to grow by absorbing each other cannibal-fashion, until the
structure is relatively coarse-grained, as shown in Fig. 4.15. Since the
crystal boundaries have higher energies than the interiors of the crystals,
a polycrystalline mass will reduce its energy if some of the grain boundaries
disappear. Consequently, at temperatures above that of recrystallisation
large crystals grow by absorbing small ones. As indicated in Fig. 4.16, a
crystal boundary tends to move towards its centre of curvature in order to
shorten its length. To facilitate this, atoms move across the boundary
to positions of greater stability where they will be surrounded by more

neighbours in the concave crystal face of the growing crystal. Thus the
large grow larger and the small grow smaller. The same type of mechanism
(in this case surface tension along a liquid film) causes small bubbles to be
absorbed by the larger ones in the froth in a glass of beer. The extent of
grain growth is dependent to a large degree on the following factors:
(a) The annealing temperature used—as temperature increases, so grain
size increases (Fig. 4.17).
(Jb) The duration of the annealing process—grains grow rapidly at first
and then more slowly (Fig. 4.17).
(c) The degree of previous cold-work. In general, heavy deformation
will lead to the formation of a large number of regions of high energy
within the crystals. These will give rise to the production of many nuclei
on recrystallisation and consequently the grain size will be small. Con-
versely, light deformation will give rise to few nuclei and the resulting
grain size will be large (Fig. 4.18). What is generally referred to as the
critical amount of cold-work is that which is just necessary to initiate recrys-
tallisation and so give rise to extremely coarse grain. This is likely to occur
at lightly-worked regions in a deep-drawn component which is subse-
quently annealed (Fig. 4.19).
(d) The use of certain additives in a metal or alloy. Thus the presence
of nickel in alloy steels limits grain growth during heat-treatment processes.
Nickel is in fact the universal grain refiner and does much to increase the
toughness of many alloys by limiting grain growth.
Insoluble particles are also thought to act as barriers to grain growth in
some cases. For example small amounts of thoria (thorium oxide) are
added to the tungsten used for electric lamp filaments. Here the films or
particles of thoria prevent excessive grain growth which would otherwise
result from maintaining the filament for long periods at temperatures well
above that of recrystallisation for tungsten.
4.51 Of these factors the one requiring the most accurate control, in
normal conditions, is the annealing temperature. Some alloys, particularly
the brasses, are exceptionally sensitive to variations in the annealing tem-
perature and an error of 1000C, on the high side, may increase crystal size

Fig. 4.19 Grain size in a deep-drawn component which has subsequently been annealed.
The grain size at the base of the cup (A) will be that of the original material since there has
been no cold-work, and consequently no recrystallisation during the annealing process. In
the side walls of the cup (B) grain size is small since heavy cold-work during the drawing
process has resulted in the formation of many nuclei during recrystallisation. In the region
(C) cold-work has been slight—-the 'critical' amount—so that, during annealing, few nuclei
formed and the resultant grain is very coarse.
five-fold for a given annealing time. This coarse grain will, in turn, lead to
loss in ductility and the formation of a rough, rumpled surface (known as
'orange peel') during a subsequent forming operation. When coarse grain
has been thus produced in material of finished size, it cannot be refined,
as is possible with steel, by heat treatment. The only remedy would be to
remelt the brass and go through the complete stages of rolling and
annealing, until once more the finished size was reached.
4.52 It follows that a reasonably accurate assessment of grain size is
necessary when a material is destined for a pressing or deep-drawing pro-
cess (6.43). Grain size is usually determined by counting the number of
crystals in a known area during the microexamination of a prepared speci-
men. The result is expressed as the number of grains per mm2. In the USA
the ASTM index is often used and this is obtained by counting the number
of grains per in2 when viewed at a magnification of x 100. The ASTM
index, G, is then given by:
N = 2(G ~1} where N is the number of grains per square inch at x 100.
Values of G between 1 and 8 cover normal grain size ranges.
A further method of estimating grain size involves measuring the Aver-
age Grain Diameter (mm). Here an image of the prepared surface is pro-
jected on to the reflex screen of a microscope at a magnification of XlOO.
A line AB, 100 mm long is previously drawn randomly on the screen and
the number of crystals cut by the line counted. The 100 mm line on the
screen represents a 1 mm line on the surface of the specimen, hence:
Average Grain Diameter = 
mm
Number of crystals cut by line
In Fig 4.20, 13 crystals have been intersected by the line AB, therefore
the Average Grain Diameter = Vi3 mm = 0.08 mm. (The optimum grain

size for most deep-drawing metals and alloys is between 0.04 and 0.06 mm
AGD.)
Naturally a more representative value of Average Grain Diameter will
be obtained if the specimen is moved several times relative to the line AB
and an average of the counts used. BS 4490:1989 lays down that two 100
mm lines at right angles to each other be used along with two 150 mm lines
at right angles to each other and diagonal to the 100 mm lines. In this way
the effects of any directionality of grain shape are minimised.
Superplasticity
4.60 Superplasticity is a property of some alloys in which very great plas-
tic elongations of up to 2000% or more can be obtained under the action
of quite low tensile stresses. This behaviour is akin to that of heated glass
where elongation is dependent upon the quantity of material to be thinned
as the material 'flows'. Although the phenomenon has been known for
more than sixty years it has only recently begun to be exploited.
4.61 When most metals are deformed plastically at temperatures well
below that of recrystallisation (approximately 0.5 Tm*) then tensile strength
increases with strain as work-hardening occurs (Fig 4.21(i)). Many metals
and alloys have stress-strain curves which are roughly governed by the
expression:
a = k& 
(1)
where a is the tensile stress, 8 the strain and r\ the work-hardening
exponent. If the temperature during deformation is now raised above that
necessary for recrystallisation—say to 0.5 or 0.6 Tm—the stress required to
produce plastic flow falls because metals are weaker when hot. Moreover,
* As mentioned earlier the melting point of a metal, Tm, is measured on the absolute scale (K), ie 0C
+ 273, for these purposes.

work-hardening disappears since the metal is effectively being hot-worked
so that recrystallisation and recovery accompany deformation.
Since work-hardening is no longer taking place, r\ - 0 and substitution
of this into (1) gives:
o = k 
(2)
represented by a straight line parallel to the e axis and giving a typical
hot-working stress-strain relationship (Fig 4.21(ii)).
4.62 In both of the cases mentioned above the extent of elongation is
limited by necking which ultimately occurs in the test piece. This necking,
which leads to rapid failure, is due to the presence of some form of inhom-
ogeneity in the metal giving rise to stress concentrations. In superplastic
alloys, however, necking is inhibited and stress is not proportional to strain
but to the strain rate, e (Fig 4.22). That is, the tensile stress required to
produce plastic flow increases as the strain rate increases, in a way similar
to which the viscous 'drag' of an oil increases as its rate of displacement is
increased. Thus as soon as a neck tends to form the strain rate in that
region increases and stress also tends to increase there. As a result defor-
mation ceases there in preference to the lower-stressed regions. This
stress-strain relationship is governed by:

which indicates that stress is proportional to strain rate and necking will
not take place. Most metals over a temperature range of, say, 0.1 to 0.9
Tm have 'm' values in the region of 0.1, whilst superplastic alloys usually
have 'm' values within the range 0.4 to 0.8.
4.63 Hence certain alloys show large elongations at temperatures in
the region of 0.5 Tm and at strain rates generally lower than are employed
in industrial forming operations. In many of these alloys crystal structure
is an important factor. Their crystals are generally very small—about
0.002 mm in diameter as compared with 0.05 mm average diameter for
most common metals and alloys. Moreover these small crystals are very
regular in shape. After large deformations have taken place grain size may
have increased slightly but crystal shape will not have changed significantly
and will remain non-directional.
4.64 Although opinions differ as to the reasons for superplasticity, it is
probable that in fine-grained metals strained at a controlled rate as outlined
above, the generation of new dislocations at grain boundaries is balanced
by the disposal of existing dislocations as they pass across grains into other
grain-boundary 'sinks' after a relatively unimpeded passage across the
small grains.
Thus a superplastic metal is one which will have a very small grain size
and will maintain it at temperatures in excess of 0.5 Tm. Whilst it is not
difficult to produce small grains in most metals at temperatures below 0.5
Tm by means of heavy cold-working programmes, to maintain these small
grains at 0.5 Tm and above is generally frustrated by the rapid grain growth
which normally occurs. Some two-phase structures are superplastic because
one phase obstructs the grain growth of the other. In fact a recent Guinness
Book of Records quotes (as a world record for superplasticity) an elong-
ation of 4850% attained with a tin-lead eutectic, ie 62Sn-38Pb.
4.65 In practice superplastic forming is a hot-stretching process
whereby material is forced into or over a one-piece die usually by air
pressure. Thus the majority of components are formed from sheet. One
of the first alloys to be shaped superplastically on an industrial scale was
Zn-22A1 (again a eutectic alloy), at a temperature of 2600C.
Since necking does not occur during superplastic extension the dieless
drawing of wire and tube is possible in much the same way as has been
used for the manufacture of glass rod and tube for a very long time.
Airframe manufacturers have pioneered the development of some titanium
alloys exhibiting superplasticity. Thus fine-grained Ti-6A1-4V will deform
superplastically under low strain-rate conditions around 9000C. This has
led to the development of manufacturing processes for complex parts from
thin sheet. The technique is also in use for an increasing number of airf rame
and missile parts. Some aluminium alloys (17.32) too are shaped using
superplastic properties.

Fracture of Metals
5.10 In an 'ideal' metal, that is one containing no flaws or defects, fracture
will occur when atomic bonding is overcome across an atomic plane which
is perpendicular to the tensile force; but in practice metals fail at much
lower stresses than the theoretical (4.14). This is due partly to the presence
of impurities and other discontinuities in the structure (Fig. 3.16), and
partly to the polycrystalline nature of metals which in itself leads to the
'pile-up' of dislocations at or near crystal boundaries. Thus fracture is a
common cause of failure in metals and whilst it will always occur when a
metal is stressed beyond its tensile strength, under certain conditions it can
also occur at stresses even below the elastic limit. Thus, some metals may
creep during long periods of time, particularly at high temperatures, until
failure occurs; whilst fracture which is the result of repeated cyclic stress
is termed fatigue failure. Some metals fail by a form of brittle fracture which
is influenced by low temperature conditions.
5.11 The nature of fracture differs from one metal to another. The
type of fracture which follows large amounts of plastic deformation is
generally referred to as ductile fracture whilst that which occurs after little
or no plastic deformation is called brittle fracture (Fig. 5.1).

It was stated in the previous chapter that during plastic deformation slip
takes place along some crystallographic planes more readily than along
others. Similarly, metallic fracture—or cleavage—tends to follow pre-
ferred crystallographic planes. Thus FCC metals are likely to suffer cleav-
age along the {111} planes (3.15), whilst BCC metals cleave along the
{100} planes. In CPH metals cleavage occurs along the basal planes of the
hexagon (designated the {0001} planes).
Brittle Fracture
5.20 Whilst plastic deformation takes place in a ductile metal by the
'rippling' of dislocations along slip planes (4.16), brittle fracture occurs as
a result of complete and sudden separation of atoms as indicated in Fig.
5.2. The theoretically-calculated stress necessary to achieve such separ-
ation is considerable, yet in practice, the actual stress required to cause
brittle fracture is often relatively small. Moreover, the results obtained for
tensile strength measurements on a large number of apparently identical
test pieces of a single brittle metal are often very variable (Fig. 5.3(i))
compared with similar determinations made for a ductile metal (Fig.
5.3(ii)). Such results suggest that in brittle materials some factor is present
which gives rise to the variability of results.
5.21 In 1920, A. A. Griffith postulated that fractures in brittle solids
were propagated from minute flaws in the material. He demonstrated that
the strength of freshly-drawn glass fibres often approached the 'theoretical'

value, but if these fibres were allowed to come into contact with any
other substance, including the atmosphere, even for short periods then the
strength was considerably reduced. This suggests that the strength of glass
fibre was very dependent upon surface perfection and that anything likely
to initiate even minute surface irregularities would weaken it. In certain
respects these principles may also be applied to brittle metals. Engineers
will already be familiar with the concept of 'stress raisers' and stress con-
centrations associated with the presence of sharp in-cut corners and the
necessity of eliminating these in engineering design whenever possible.
Thus in iron castings in-cut corners are rounded by using leather 'fillets'
on the wooden pattern.
5.22 Griffith's Crack Theory. Whilst the presence of a small fissure (Fig.
5.4) will obviously reduce the effective cross-section of the material, the
reduction in breaking stress is very much greater than can be accounted
for by this reduction in cross-sectional area. This is because an applied
stress, S, generates stress concentrations at the tip of the fissure.
Griffith concluded that the concentrated stress, Sc, is related to the
applied stress, S, the width of the crack, c, and the radius of curvature of
the tip of the crack, r, by:
Fig. 5.4.

If we assume that the tip radius of such a crack is of the order of 10~10
m (roughly one atomic radius) and that such cracks are about 10~4 m in
width, then the value SJS (which we can call the factor of stress concen-
tration) is of the order of 103. This indicates that the actual stress, 5C,
operating at the tip of the crack is some thousand times greater than the
applied stress, S. In this case fracture is taking place at a localised stress
nearer to the theoretical value. When a crack progresses through a brittle
material under the action of a constant applied stress, S, the concentrated
stress, Sc, at the tip increases since an increase in c gives rise to an increase
in the term dr. The speed of crack propagation therefore increases and
failure is certain.
5.23 So far we have considered only the effects of an applied tensile
stress on a brittle material. If however the applied stress is compressive
this stress will be transmitted across existing micro-cracks without causing
any stress concentrations—that is, a compressive stress will tend to 'close
up' existing fissures. For this reason many brittle metallic materials such as
cast iron are relatively weak in tension but strong in compression. Failure in
compression will ultimately take place when compressive forces are so
high that they produce tensile components of sufficient magnitude along
crystallographic planes in the region of a fissure tip.
5.24 lntercrystalline Brittle Fracture In the foregoing paragraphs we
have been dealing with brittle fracture in terms of cleavage along transcvys-
talline planes. Brittle fracture also occurs by the propagation of cracks
along grain boundaries—that is, by mtercrystalline fracture. In some cases
this type of fracture is due to the presence of grain-boundary films of a
hard, brittle second phase. Such films may be formed by segregation during
solidification (3.41) so that fracture of this type is more commonly found
in cast materials. Brittle films of bismuth segregate at the crystal boundaries
of copper in this way so that very small quantities of bismuth (less than
0.01%) may cause excessive brittleness in copper.
Impurities present in solid solution may also segregate at grain boun-
daries during the normal process of coring (8.23). A high concentration of
the solute atoms in the grain-boundary region may give rise to brittleness.
This is probably due to the pegging of dislocation movements and the
consequent initiation of micro-cracks at the grain boundaries.
5.25 Temper Brittleness This occurs in some low-alloy steels when
tempered in the range 250-4000C (13.42), and is probably due to the
precipitation of films or particles of carbides at grain boundaries. Although
tensile strength, and even ductility, are not seriously reduced a very large
reduction in impact value is experienced and fracture is intercrystalline.
Ductile Fracture
5.30 As was indicated in Fig. 5.3 the stress at which a ductile metal is
likely to fail is much more predictable than that stress in a brittle metal and
this fact alone makes ductile metals more suitable for fail-safe engineering
design. Moreover, as plastic deformation begins, the tip radius of any

micro-crack present is likely to increase and this will automatically reduce
the concentrated stress, 5C, as the value of clr (in the Griffith equation)
decreases. As a result of this stress relaxation propagation of the crack
may cease. The fracture which ultimately occurs in ductile materials is due
partly to strain hardening which progressively reduces the ductility which
is necessary for further stress relaxation.
5.31 It is difficult to differentiate implicitly between brittle and ductile
fracture since some brittle metals undergo some ductile deformation before
fracture, whilst many ductile metals exhibit final brittle-type cleavage.
However, whilst a brittle fracture is one in which the progress of the crack
involves very little plastic deformation of the neighbouring metal, a ductile
fracture is one which proceeds as a result of high localised plastic defor-
mation of the metal near the tip of the crack. Thus, whilst the two extremes
of these methods of failure are easily recognised, there can be no sharp
division between brittle and ductile fracture. A fracture which is almost
completely of the brittle variety will exhibit a mass of minute facets which
reflect light strongly and reveal the crystalline nature of the metal. An
almost completely ductile fracture, on the other hand, shows a rough, dull
dirty-grey surface because much of that surface has been deformed along
the general plane of fracture. When viewed under the scanning electron
microscope (10.33) however the surface of a ductile fracture has a 'dimpled'
appearance, caused by the presence of a multitude of minute cavities
accompanying the rupture process. Closer examination reveals that the
formation of these minute cavities is due to the presence of very small
particles of impurity and other phases. This confirms the observed fact that
as the purity of a metal increases so does its ductility.
5.32 Most ductile polycrystalline metals fail with the well-known cup-
and-cone fracture. Fracture of this type follows the formation of a neck in
a tensile test piece. Crack formation begins at the centre of the neck on a
plane that is roughly normal to the applied stress axis. Small cavities form
near the centre of this cross section (Fig. 5.5(i)) and these coalesce to form
a visible fissure (Fig. 5.5(iii)). As deformation proceeds the crack spreads
outwards towards the edges of the test piece. The final fracture then occurs
rapidly along a surface which makes an angle of approximately 45° with
the stress axis. This leaves a circular lip on one half of the test piece and
a corresponding bevel on the surface of the other half, leading to the
formation of a cup on one half and a cone with a flattened apex on the
other half (Fig. 5.1(i)).
Factors Leading to Crack Formation
5.40 Very pure metals are much more ductile than those of slightly lower
purity and will often draw down to a 'chisel point' where the cross-section
at failure is approaching zero. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that
even minute inclusions in the microstructure play an important part in
nucleating cracks. When slip in a metal takes place dislocations will tend
to pile up at the metal/inclusion interface. Assuming that the inclusion

itself is strong and does not shear, a minute fissure will develop at the
interface (Fig. 5.6). Of course, the development of the fissure will also
depend upon the degree of adhesion between the surface of the inclusion
and that of the metal. Thus, if there is little adhesion as, for example, at
the interface between copper and cuprous oxide particles, then fissures will
form easily, but if adhesion is high then the particles may indeed have a
strengthening effect. Thus sintered aluminium powder (SAP), which con-
tains a high proportion of aluminium oxide particles, is stronger than pure
aluminium because of the high adhesion at the Al/Al2O3 interface.
5.41 Other barriers to the movement of dislocations can also initiate
micro-cracks in a similar manner. Thus Fig. 5.7 suggests how a grain boun-

dary can act as a barrier to the movement of dislocations so that a pile-up
occurs and nucleates a micro-crack. Such a crack continues to grow as
further dislocations, possibly generated from the same Frank-Read
source, move to join it. Dislocations will not cross grain boundaries since
lack of alignment and some disorder will always be present there.
Crack initiation can also be caused by movement of dislocations along
close-packed or other planes within a crystal (Fig. 5.8(i)). These dislo-
cations then pile up at the intersections of the slip planes and so form a
crack (Fig. 5.8(ii)).
5.42 It was shown earlier (5.22) that, arising from Griffith's Crack
Theory, at the tip of the crack:

Thus the spread of a crack in a plate glass window is arrested by drilling
a hole in front of the tip of the advancing crack. Similarly, catastrophic
brittle fracture in welded-steel ships (5.50) was prevented by including
dummy rivet holes to arrest the progress of cracks already initiated at
structural faults in the steel.

5.50 There have been many instances in the past of failure of metals by
unexpected brittleness at low temperatures. That is, metals which suffered
normal ductile fracture at ambient temperatures would fail at low tempera-
tures by sudden cleavage fracture and at comparatively low stresses. The
failure of the motor sledges during the very early stages of the British
South Pole Expedition of 1912-13 may well have been due to fracture of
this type and contributed towards the final disaster which overtook the
Polar party. In more recent years similar failure was experienced in the
welded 'liberty ships' manufactured during the Second World War for
carrying supplies from America to Europe and was unexpected and
dangerous.
Under normal conditions the stress required to cause cleavage is higher
than that necessary to cause slip, but if, by some circumstances, slip is
suppressed, brittle fracture will occur when the internal tensile stress
increases to the value necessary to cause failure. This situation can arise
under the action of bi-axial or tri-axial stresses within the material. Such
stresses may be residual from some previous treatment, and the presence
of points of stress concentration may aggravate the situation. The liberty
ships mentioned above were fabricated by welding plates together to form
a continuous body. Cracks usually started at sharp corners or arc-weld
spots and propagated right round the hull, so that, finally, the ship broke
in half. Had the hull been riveted, the crack would have been arrested at
the first rivet hole it encountered. Some riveted joints are now in fact
incorporated in such structures to act as crack arresters.
5.51 The relationship between mechanical properties and the method
of stress application has already been mentioned (2.52) with particular
reference to the impact test. Plastic flow depends upon the movement of
dislocations and this occurs in some finite time. If the load is applied very
rapidly it is possible for stress to increase so quickly that it cannot be
relieved by slip. A momentary increase of stress to a value above the yield
stress will produce fracture.
5.52 As temperature decreases, the movement of dislocations becomes
more difficult and this increases the possibility of internal stress exceeding
the yield stress at some instant. Brittle fracture is therefore more common
at low temperatures. This is supported by the fact that the liberty ships
were in service in the cold North Atlantic.
5.53 Those metals with a FCC structure maintain ductility at low tem-
peratures, whilst some metals with structures other than FCC tend to
exhibit brittleness. BCC ferrite is particularly susceptible to brittle fracture,
which follows a transcrystalline path along the (100) planes (see 4.12). This
occurs at low temperatures as indicated in Fig. 5.9 and the temperature at
which brittleness suddenly increases is known as the transition temperature.
Other things being equal, as the carbon content of a steel increases so
does the transition temperature, making steel more liable to brittle fracture
near ambient temperatures. Phosphorus has an even stronger effect in

steels.
raising the transition temperature in steel and this is one reason why phos-
phorus is one of the least desirable impurities in ordinary carbon steels.
Some elements, notably manganese and nickel, have the reverse effect in
that they depress the transition temperature. Thus, for applications involv-
ing atmospheric temperatures the transition temperature can be reduced
to safe limits by increasing the manganese-carbon ratio of the steel, whilst
at the same time controlling the grain size by small additions of aluminium.
A suitable steel contains 0.14% carbon and 1.3% manganese. Where lower
temperatures are involved it is necessary to use low-nickel steels.
Fatigue
5.60 Engineers have long been aware that either 'live' loads or alternating
stresses of relatively small magnitude can cause fracture in a metallic struc-
ture which could carry a much greater static or 'dead' load. Under the
action of repeated or fluctuating stresses a metal may become fatigued.
Some of the earliest quantitative research into metal fatigue was carried
out in 1861 by Sir William Fairbairn. He found that raising and lowering
a 3-tonne mass onto a wrought iron girder some 3 x 106 times would cause
the girder to break, yet a static load of 12 tonnes was necessary to cause
failure of a similar girder. From further investigations he concluded that
there was some load below 3 tonnes which could be raised and lowered an
infinite number of times without causing failure. Some ten years later
Wohler did further work in this direction and developed the fatigue-testing
machine which bears his name.
Many engineering metals are subjected to fluctuating stresses during
service. Thus the connecting rods in a piston engine are successively pushed

and pulled; contact springs in electrical switch gear are bent to and fro;
rotating axles suffer a reversal of stress direction through every 180° of
rotation; and aircraft wings are continually bent back and forth as they
pass through turbulent air. Often a structure will vibrate in sympathy with
some external vibration emanating from equipment such as an air com-
pressor. This too may initiate fatigue failure so that fracture by fatigue is
probably the most common cause of engineering failure in metals.
5.61 The yield strength of a material is a measure of the static stress it
can withstand without permanent deformation, and is applicable only to
components which operate under static loading. Metals subjected to fluc-
tuating or repeated forces fail at lower stresses than do similar metals
under the action of 'dead' or steady loads. A typical relationship between
the number of cycles of stress (N) and the stress range (S) for a steel is
shown in the S-N curve (Fig. 5.10 (H)). This indicates that if the stress in
the steel is reduced then it will endure a greater number of stress cycles.
The curve eventually becomes almost horizontal indicating that, for the
corresponding stress, the member will endure an infinite number of cycles.
The stress born under these conditions is called the fatigue limit, 5D. For
many steels the fatigue limit is approximately one half of the tensile
strength as measured in a 'static' test.
5.62 Most non-ferrous metals and alloys and also some steels operating
under conditions of corrosion, give S-N curves of the type shown in Fig.
5.10(iii). Here there is no fatigue limit as such and a member will fail
ultimately if subjected to the appropriate number of stress reversals even
at extremely small stresses. With such materials which show no fatigue

limit an endurance limit, SN, is used instead. This is the maximum stress
which can be sustained for a stated number, N, of cycles of stress.
Components made from materials of this type must therefore be designed
with some specific life (in terms of stress cycles) in mind and then 'junked'
—as our American friends put it—after an appropriate working life, that
is, before the number of cycles (N) for the corresponding stress (S) has
been reached.
It should be noted that many authorities now use the terms 'fatigue limit'
and 'endurance limit' to mean the same, but the above distinction still
seems valid in differentiating between the two classes of S-N curve
obtained for different materials.
5.63 Fatigue-testing machines vary in design but many are based on
the original Wohler concept (Fig. 5.11). Here the test piece is in the form
of a cantilever which rotates in a chuck, the load, W, being applied at the
'free' end. For every rotation of 180° the stress will change from W in one
direction to W in the opposite direction. Thus the stress-range will be 2W
with a mean value of zero. To determine the fatigue limit (or endurance
limit) a number of test pieces are tested in this way, each at a different
value of W, until failure occurs, or alternatively, until an infinite number
of stress reversals have been endured—since it is somewhat impracticable
to apply an infinite number of reversals, a large number (say 20 x 106) is
used instead.

5.64 The Mechanism of Fatigue Failure Fatigue failure begins quite
early in the service life of the member by the formation of a small crack,
generally at some point on the external surface. This crack then develops
slowly into the material in a direction roughly perpendicular to the main
tensile axis. Ultimately the cross-sectional area of the member will have
been so reduced that it can no longer withstand the applied load and
ordinary tensile fracture will result. A fatigue crack 'front' advances a very
small amount during each stress cycle and each increment of advance is
shown on the fracture surface as a minute ripple line. These ripple lines
radiate out from the origin of fracture as a series of approximately concen-
tric arcs. The individual ripples are far too small to be visible on the
fractured surface except by using very high-powered metallographic
methods, but under practical conditions a few ripples much larger than the
rest, probably corresponding to peak stress conditions, are produced and
these are visible on the fractured surface showing the general path which
the crack has followed (Fig. 5.12).
Fig. 5.12 The progress of fatigue failure.
A fatigue fracture is often easy to identify because the crack-growth region is burnished by
the mating surfaces rubbing together as stresses alternate. The ultimate fracture is strongly
'crystalline' in appearance.
A fatigue fracture thus develops in three stages—nucleation, crack
growth and final catastrophic failure. Since the crack propagates slowly
from the source, the fractured surfaces rub together due to the pulsating
nature of the stress and so the surfaces become burnished whilst still
exhibiting the conchoidal markings representing the large ripples. Final
fracture, when the residual cross section of the member is no longer able
to carry the load, is typically crystalline in appearance. Fatigue failures in
metals are therefore generally very easy to identify.
Fatigue cracks are not the result of brittle fracture but of plastic slip.
During cyclic stressing, at stresses above the fatigue limit, plastic defor-
mation is produced continuously and alternately positive and negative. It
is this continuous to-and-fro plastic deformation in localised regions which
ultimately propagates and spreads a fatigue crack. The continual plastic
oscillation of metal layers along slip planes in and out of the surface causes

some of the metal to produce ridges as work hardening sets in to resist
'back slip'. These ridges are forced up at the surface and are termed
extrusions (Fig. 5.13). Narrow fissures or intrusions are formed in a similar
manner. Several of these intrusions may then interconnect to initiate the
start of a fatigue crack.
Fig. 5.13 
(i) Stages in the formation of an extrusion by movements of blocks of atoms
along slip planes; (ii) the nature of extrusions and intrusions.
5.65 Some Causes of Fatigue Failure Since the fatigue character-
istics of metals can be measured accurately, it seems reasonable to suppose
that fatigue failure due to a lack of appropriate allowances in design should
not occur. This is of course true, yet fatigue failure does continue to happen
even in the most sophisticated items of engineering equipment. The cata-
strophic fatigue failure in Comet airliners some years ago is a case in point.
In many such instances a member may be designed to carry a static load
(well above 5Dor SN), yet it may be suffering undetected vibrations which
give rise to reversal of stress at a value above SD (or SN). Such vibrations
are often sympathetic.
Other design faults include the presence of such stress raisers as a sharp-
cornered key way in a shaft or an unduly sharp radius in an in-cut corner.
Poor workmanship in the shape of surface roughness, scratches or careless
toolmarks can also cause stress concentrations. Minute quench cracks in
heat-treated steels are also a source of fatigue failure as are the presence
of small cavities, inclusions or other discontinuities just below the surface
of the material. A surface weakened by decarburisation or other types of
deterioration which have led to the softening and weakening of the surface
layers also favours the initiation of micro-cracks via the formation of
intrusions.
Corrosive conditions in the environment can also provide stress-raisers
in the form of etch-pits and other surface intrusions such as grain boundary
attack. Ordinary surface oxidation may have a similar effect and conse-
quently nucleate a fatigue crack.
5.66 Methods of Improving Fatigue Strength In order to maintain
fatigue strength it follows from the above that surface finish should always

be good. Engineer craftsmen of the past were not wasting their time when
producing a high surface polish on many of their items of equipment.
Since the fatigue strength of a metal is approximately proportional to its
tensile strength, any method used to increase the tensile strength of the
material will correspondingly improve the fatigue strength. As fatigue fail-
ure nearly always commences at the surface, methods of surface hardening
will be most effective in limiting the initiation of fatigue cracks. Thus,
work-hardening of the surface by shot-peening is beneficial, whilst the
carburising and nitriding (19.10) of steels will improve fatigue strength. A
case-hardened axle provides a good all-round combination of core tough-
ness, surface wear-resistance and fatigue resistance.
Creep
5.70 So far in this description of plastic deformation and ultimate failure
of metals little mention has been made of the part played by time. Never-
theless, metals in service are often required to withstand steady stresses
over long periods of time and it has been shown that under these conditions
gradual deformation of the metal may occur at all temperatures and
stresses. Metals can therefore fail in this way at a stress well below the
tensile strength at that particular temperature. This phenomenon of con-
tinuous gradual extension under a steady force is known as creep.
The effects of creep in most engineering metals are not serious at ambi-
ent temperatures though some metals of low melting point (Tm) such as
lead exhibit noticeable creep under these conditions. Lead sheeting which
may have been protecting a church roof for centuries is sometimes found
to be slightly thicker near the eaves than at the ridge. The lead has 'crept'
under its own weight over the centuries.
Creep becomes very serious with many metals at temperatures above
0.4rm where Tm, as noted previously (4.42) is measured on the Kelvin (or
'absolute') scale. Thus Tm for lead is equivalent to 327 + 273 or 600 K.
Hence 0.4 Tm (for lead) is 240 K or -33°C. This explains why lead sheeting
on a church roof will be likely to creep appreciably at ambient temperatures
between, say, — 100C and 300C. Similarly the effects of creep must be very
seriously considered in the design of gas and steam turbines, steam and
chemical plant and furnace equipment. Creep is thus associated in practical
terms with both time and temperature and is basically due to slip by the
movement of dislocations.
5.71 Fig. 5.14 shows the type of creep curve obtained when a metal is
suitably stressed. This curve indicates that, following the initial elastic
strain, the plastic strain associated with creep occurs in three stages:
(i) Primary, or transient creep, EP, beginning at a fairly rapid rate
which then decreases with time because work-hardening sets in.
(ii) Secondary, or steady-rate creep, PS, in which the rate of strain is
uniform and at its lowest value.
(iii) Tertiary creep, SX, in which the rate of strain increases rapidly

until fracture occurs at X. This stage coincides with necking of the test
piece.
The form of relationship which exists between stress, temperature and
the resultant creep rate is shown in Fig. 5.15. At a low stress and/or a low
temperature (curve A) some primary creep occurs but this falls to a neglig-
ible value as strain-hardening prevents further slip from taking place. With
increased stress and/or temperature (curves B and C) the rate of secondary
creep also increases leading to tertiary creep and ultimate failure.

Variations of creep rate with stress and temperature.
In curve A the creep rate soon becomes negligible as work-hardening sets in. In curve C
the creep rate is higher than in curve B because of the use of either higher stress or higher
temperature.

5.72 In creep testing, the specimen, in form similar to a tensile test
piece, is enclosed in a thermostatically controlled electric tube furnace
which can be maintained with accuracy over long periods at any given
temperature up to 10000C or more. A simple lever system is often used to
load the test piece, and some form of delicate extensometer or strain-gauge
system employed to measure the resultant extension at suitable time inter-
vals. The extensometer is sometimes of the optical type, using mirrors,
scales and telescopes.
Creep values were originally assessed in terms of the limiting creep stress.
This was defined as that stress at any given temperature, below which
no measurable creep takes place. Obviously this value depends upon the
sensitivity of the measuring equipment and in any case it is now known
that some creep occurs at all combinations of stress and temperature.
Moreover, since formal creep tests involve long periods of time sometimes
running into many months, other related tensile values are now used
instead of the old concept of 'limiting creep stress'.
Most tests involve measuring the stress which will give rise to some
predetermined rate of creep during the secondary stage of uniform defor-
mation. The creep rate will therefore be equivalent to the slope of the
curve during the secondary stage of creep. The Hatfield 'time-yield value'
is derived from such a short-term creep test. It determines the stress at a
given temperature which will produce a strain of 0.5% of the gauge length
in the first twenty-four hours and a further strain of not more than one
part per million of the gauge length in the next forty-eight hours. Creep
tests of this type do not attempt to derive a 'creep limit' but are practical
values upon which engineering design can be based.
5.73 The Mechanism of Creep Creep is a deformation process in
which three main features appear to be involved:
(i) the normal movement of dislocations along slip planes;
(ii) a process known as 'dislocation climb' which is responsible for
rapid creep at temperatures above 0.5 Tm\
(iii) slipping at grain boundaries.
In the primary stages of creep, dislocations move quickly at first but
soon become piled-up at various barriers. Nevertheless, thermal activation
enables them to surmount some barriers, though at a decreasing rate so
that the creep rate is reduced. At temperatures in excess of 0.5 Tm, thermal
activation is sufficient to promote a process known as 'dislocation climb'
(Fig. 5.16). This would bring into use new slip planes and so reduce the
rate of work hardening. Hence creep is a process in which work hardening
is balanced by thermal softening which allows slip to continue. At low
temperatures recovery does not take place due to lack of thermal activation
(Curve A—Fig. 5.15) and so unrelieved work-hardening leads to a re-
duction in the creep rate almost to zero.
In addition to plastic deformation by dislocation movement, deformation
by a form of slip at the grain boundaries also occurs during the secondary
stage of creep. These movements possibly lead to the formation of 'vacant
sites', that is lattice positions from which atoms are missing, and this in
turn makes possible 'dislocation climb' (Fig. 5.16). The relationship

Fig. 5.16 Two examples illustrating 'dislocation climb'.
In each case this is made possible by the presence nearby of a 'vacant site' (or 'vacancy'),
ie a lattice position not occupied by an atom. In both (a) and (b) the dislocation has 'climbed'
on to a new slip plane.
between grain boundaries and creep is indicated by the fact that at high
temperatures fine-grained metals creep more than coarse-grained metals
of the same compositions, presumably because the fine-grained metals
contain a higher proportion of grain-boundary region per unit volume of
metal. At low temperatures, where the grain-boundary material is more
'viscous', fine-grained metals are more creep-resistant and generally
tougher.
In the tertiary stage of creep micro-cracks are initiated at grain boun-
daries due largely to the movement of dislocations, but in some cases to
the migration of vacant sites there. Necking and consequent rapid failure
follow.
5.74 Creep Resistance This can be increased by impeding the move-
ment of dislocations in a metal and also by inhibiting the formation of new
ones. Thus the presence of solute atoms (8.21) which do not diffuse rapidly
will 'pin down' dislocations effectively; whilst the presence of small dis-
persed particles of a hard, strong constituent will have a 'particle-
hardening' effect (8.62) by acting as barriers to the movement of a
dislocation front. The high-temperature 'Nimonic' series of alloys (18.32)
rely on this type of strengthening mechanism.

The Industrial Shaping
of Metals
6.10 The chance discovery of small quantities of copper in the uncom-
bined state undoubtedly led to the cold-forging of this malleable metal into
various tools and weapons some seven thousand years ago. During the
millennia which followed the craft of the metalworker developed so that,
by the time of Tubal Cain, he was a well-established member of society.
The melting and smelting of metals was probably achieved by chance in a
primitive camp fire and the possibilities of metal casting ultimately
recognised from the observation that solid metal retained the shape of the
depression in the earth where it solidified.
What we now refer to as investment casting' was being used in Mesopot-
amia as long as five thousand years ago. A rough shape of the proposed
casting was modelled in clay and this was coated with several layers of
beeswax. The desired shape of the article was then carefully carved in the
surface of the wax and this, in turn, was enclosed in a clay 'cocoon'. After
allowing the clay to dry the wax was carefully melted out leaving a cavity
between the outer clay shell and the inner clay core. Into this cavity molten
copper or bronze was poured. The clay core was generally supported in
position by being attached to the outer mould at some point. This left a
hole in the final casting, generally arranged in some inconspicuous position.
The ancient metal worker was an artist rather than a scientist though he
soon learned the value of cold forging in hardening both copper and
bronze. Most of the empires of the ancient world relied for their military
prowess on swords and spears fashioned from these metals.
6.11 In modern times metals and alloys may be shaped into something
approaching the final form by one of the following programmes of oper-
ations:
(i) casting into some form of shaped mould;
(ii) casting as an ingot followed by a hot-working process;
(iii) casting as an ingot followed by a cold-working process;
(iv) compacting and sintering from a metallic powder.

Other processes such as electro-deposition and the condensation of
metal vapours are sometimes used but these operations are usually con-
fined to the surface treatment of metallic components rather than to their
actual shaping. Thus, electro-deposition is sometimes used to build up
parts which have become badly worn. Any one of the shaping methods
mentioned above may be followed by some form of metal-cutting process,
referred to generally as 'machining'. The study of this wide field of oper-
ations is the province of the production engineer but a very brief treatment
of the metallurgical aspects of machinability is given later in this chapter.
The industrial processes catalogued in this chapter are dealt with in greater
detail in Part II but it was thought desirable to give a brief outline of the
more important of them at this stage to help those readers who will not be
studying metal shaping at a more detailed level.
Sand casting, die casting and allied processes
6.20 Large numbers of engineering and domestic components are pro-
duced by casting the molten metal or alloy into some form of mould cavity
which will give to the component its final shape. The best known of these
processes is sand casting. Here a suitable foundry sand is rammed around
a wooden pattern, the two halves of the moulding box being capable of
separation (Fig. 6.1) so that the pattern can be withdrawn leaving a mould
cavity into which metal can be poured.
Fig. 6.1 
Mould for a sand-casting.
A wooden pattern is used, the top box being raised so that the pattern can be removed.
If large numbers of castings are required and the process proves techni-
cally suitable a far superior product is obtained by casting into a metal
mould. In permanent-mould casting (also known as gravity die casting) the
molten alloy is allowed to run into the metal mould under gravity, whilst
in die casting (also called pressure die casting) the charge is forced into the
mould cavity under considerable pressure (Fig. 6.2). The use of die casting
is confined mainly to zinc- or aluminium-base alloys and the product is

metallurgically superior to a sand casting in that the internal structure is
more uniform and the grain much finer because of the rapid cooling rates
which obtain due to the metal mould. Moreover, output rates are much
higher when using a permanent mould than they are when using sand
moulds. Greater dimensional accuracy and a better surface finish are also
obtained by die casting. However, some alloys which can be sand cast
cannot be die cast because of their high shrinkage coefficients during solidi-
fication. Such alloys would inevitably crack due to their high contraction
during solidification in the rigid metal mould.
Obviously the cost of producing metal dies is high so that die casting is
essentially a process suitable for providing large numbers of castings of the
types used in domestic washing machines, vacuum cleaners, automobile
wind-screen wiper motors and the like. If only small numbers of castings
are required then sand casting may have to be used since the cost of making
a wooden pattern is small compared with that for a metal die. Moreover,
many intricate shapes can be produced only by sand casting because of the
possibility of using destructible sand cores.
6.21 Shell Moulding (5.30—Pt. II) is similar in principle to sand cast-
ing in that a two-part mould is used but, whilst a small proportion of clay
acts as a natural bond in foundry sand, in shell moulding a fine clay-free
silica sand with added bonding material of the thermosetting resin type
(phenol- or urea-formaldehyde) is used. As is indicated in Fig. 6.3 each
half of the shell mould is produced when the heated metal pattern is
covered with the sand/resin mixture in a rotatable 'dump box'. The resin
hardens on the hot pattern, binding together the sand particles to produce
a strong tough half-mould. Though Fig. 6.3 illustrates a mould made from

two similar half-moulds the complete mould need not be symmetrical about
the parting line so long as the halves 'match' at the parting line. The

usually supported in coarse sand or gravel to receive their metal charge.
The main advantages of this process over sand casting are greater dimen-
sional accuracy and a better surface finish.

(5.40—Pt. II). As mentioned at the begin-
ning of this Chapter the 'lost wax' process had its origins in ancient history.
It was rediscovered in the sixteenth century by Benvenuto Cellini who
used the process to produce many works of art in gold and silver, but the
development of investment casting for engineering purposes took place
more recently during the Second World War. In this process accurately
dimensioned wax patterns are produced in a metal master mould. A
number of these patterns are then attached to a central wax 'runner' (Fig.
6.4(ii)) and the resultant 'tree' invested with a mixture usually consisting
of fine sillimanite sand and ethyl silicate. This, in the presence of moisture,
hydrolyses to form a solid bond between the sillimanite particles. The wax
pattern is then melted out and the mould baked, partly to harden it but

also to prevent chilling of the metal charge in thin sections. The main
feature of the process is that small castings of very high dimensional accu-
racy can be produced. Moreover the casting has no 'parting line' and
surface finish is excellent.
6.23 The Replicast ceramic shell process The lost wax' process
described briefly above is limited generally to the manufacture of small
precision castings since the cost of large amounts of investment material
would make it uncompetitive for large castings. The Replicast process
virtually replaces the wax pattern with one produced in high-density
expanded polystyrene. Complex patterns can be made by sticking together
several polystyrene units. Since this is a very light-weight material only a
thin (4-6mm) shell of the investment material is necessary because of
reduced stresses during the removal of the pattern. The thin shell mould
is then supported by loose sand in a box prior to pouring the charge. The
loose sand is vibrated so that it enters all recesses and so provides even
support to the thin mould.
Even when modern technical controls are introduced during its pro-
duction a casting is in many respects one of the least reliable or predictable
of metallurgical structures because of the many variable factors which
operate during the melting of the metal and its subsequent casting and
solidification in the mould. Blow-holes, shrinkage cavities and oxidation
defects may be present in a sand casting due to poor melting and/or casting
practice. Moreover, the inherent characteristics of a cast metal, particularly
in respect of coarse grain and segregation of impurities are such that its
mechanical properties are always inferior to those of a wrought product.
If, therefore, mechanical strength and toughness are prime factors, a
casting should properly only be used if the component is of such intricate
shape that it cannot be produced by any other means, or if the alloy used
is not amenable to any working processes, as, for example, some of the
modern 'super alloys' (18.32 and 18.86) which are so strong and hard at
high temperatures that they cannot be forged satisfactorily. In commerce
the cost of manufacture must always be considered however, so that where
only a few components are required, the choice of operation will frequently
fall upon sand casting, notwithstanding its shortcomings.
6.24 The reader may be familiar with those 'non-drip' household paints
which are said to be thixotropic. They are firm jelly-like materials which,
when subjected to shear stress in the form of brush strokes, immediately
become much less viscous and flow freely. When brushing ceases the paint
viscosity increases again so that it does not drip. A metal shaping process
known as thixomolding is based on this principle and is mentioned at this
point as a process which in a sense is intermediate between casting and
hot working.
The thixomolder consists essentially of a screw pump into which solid
metal is fed in pellet form. As the metal is forced along the barrel it passes
into a heating zone where it reaches a part-liquid/part-solid state. This
slurry, containing up to 65% solid, is then forced at considerable pressure
into a die somewhat similar in design to that used in diecasting. High
pressure results in thixotropic flow of the alloy. The process is particularly

useful in shaping magnesium alloys where foundry melting is hazardous
and melting losses high.
Hot-working Processes
6.30 An increase in the temperature of a metal leads to an increase in
inter-atomic spacings so that the bond strength will decrease. Moreover,
the strain caused by the presence of a dislocation will also decrease due to
the increase in inter-atomic distances. Thus the dislocation can be moved
more easily through the crystal. As a result yield strength falls as tempera-
ture rises.
Since most metals become considerably softer and more malleable as
temperature rises less energy is needed to produce a given amount of
deformation. In fact, hot-working processes are invariably carried out
above the recrystallisation temperature of a metal or alloy. Deformation
and recrystallisation therefore take place simultaneously so that in addition
to a saving of energy a considerable speeding up of the process is possible
with no tedious inter-stage annealing operations such as attend cold-work-
ing processes. Some alloys can only be shaped by hot-working since they
are hard or brittle when cold due to the presence of a hard microconstituent
which is absorbed at the hot-working temperature.
Whilst malleability increases with rise in temperature ductility generally
decreases because the material becomes less strong as the temperature rises
and so tends to tear apart in tension. Consequently hot-working processes
invariably involve the use of compressive forces as in forging, rolling and
extrusion, whilst drawing processes which employ tensile forces are essen-
tially cold-working operations. The main hot-working processes are dealt
with briefly below.
6.31 Hot-rolling The rolling mill was adapted by Henry Cort in 1783
as a simple 'two-high' non-reversing mill for the production of wrought-iron
bar. The advent of the Bessemer process in 1856 made necessary the
development of rolling-mill technique so that it could keep pace with the
large amount of steel made by this new mass-production method. Thus in
1857 the 'three-high' mill was introduced so that the work piece could be
rolled on the 'return pass' (Fig.6.5(i)). Unfortunately support of the bear-
ings for the centre roll was generally found to be difficult so Ramsbottom
developed the fore-runner of the modern two-high reversing mill (Fig.6.5
(ii)) at Cr ewe in 1866.
Hot-rolling is universally employed in the reduction of large steel ingots
to sections, strip, sheet and rod of various sizes. In fact the only conditions
under which cold-work is applied to steel are when the section is too small
to retain its heat, or when a superior finish is required in the product.
A steel-rolling shop consists of a powerful two-high reversing mill to
'breakdown' the white-hot ingots, followed by trains of rolls (Fig. 6.5(iii))
which will be either plain or grooved according to the type of product
being manufactured. Hot-rolling is similarly applied to most non-ferrous

alloys in the initial breaking-down stages, but the finishing operations are
more likely to involve cold work.
6.32 Forging Tubal Cain (Genesis IV, 22) was forging metals by hand
at least six thousand years ago but there is evidence that pre-historic man
was using this type of process to fashion copper some two thousand years
earlier. Hand forging is still used to a limited extent by the smith but
most modern forging is power-assisted. Wrought iron was the traditional
material of the smith but many ferrous and non-ferrous alloys are now
shaped by forging processes and wrought iron has long become obsolete
as an engineering material.
During forging the coarse 'as-cast' structure is broken down and is
replaced, as recrystallisation proceeds, by one which is of relatively fine
grain. At the same time impurities are redistributed in a more or less
fibrous form. Therefore it is more satisfactory, all other things being equal,
to forge a component than to cast it to shape.
6.33 Drop-forging 
If a large number of identical forged components
are required, then it is economically preferable to make them by a drop-
forging process. In this process (Fig. 6.6) a shaped die is used, one half
being attached to the hammer and the other half to the anvil. With complex
shapes a series of dies may be used.
The hammer, working between two vertical guides, is mechanically lifted
some distance above the anvil and allowed to fall under gravity on to the
work piece which consists of a heated bar or billet of the metal placed on
the anvil half of the die. As the hammer falls it forges the metal between
the two halves of the die. A modification of drop-forging employs either
mechanical or steam power to force the hammer downwards, thus increas-

ing the power of the blow. 'High-energy rate' forging in which the machines
are generally operated by pneumatic pressure is now also used (8.37—Part
ii).
6.34 Heading 'Heading' or 'up-set' forging is employed extensively for
the manufacture of bolts, rivets and other components, where an increase
in diameter is necessary without loss of strength and shock-resistance. The
stock bar is heated for a portion of its length and then forged, as shown
in Fig. 6.7, in a machine which also parts off the component. It will be
obvious that a bolt head forged in this way will be much stronger than one
which has been machined from a bar, since forging does not cut into the
fibrous structure of the material and thus introduce planes of weakness
into the finished bolt head.
6.35 Hot-pressing 
Hot-pressing is a development of the drop-forging
process, but is generally applied in the manufacture of more simple shapes.
The hammer of drop-forging is replaced by a hydraulically driven ram, so
that, instead of receiving a rapid succession of hammer blows, the metal
is gradually squeezed by the static pressure of the ram. This downwards
thrust is sometimes as great as 100 MN.
The main advantage of hot-pressing over drop-forging is that working
is no longer confined to the surface layers, as it is with drop-forging, but
is transmitted uniformly to the interior of the metal being shaped. This is
particularly important when forging very large components, such as marine
propeller shafts, which would otherwise suffer from having a non-uniform
internal structure.
6.36 Extrusion The extrusion process is now used for shaping a variety
of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys. Its most important feature is

that we are able to force the metal through a die, and, in a single process
from the cast billet, to obtain quite complicated sections of tolerably accu-
rate dimensions. The metal billet is heated to the required extrusion tem-
perature (350-5000C for aluminium alloys; 700-8000C for brasses; 1100-
12500C for steels) and placed in the container of the extrusion press (Fig.
6.8). The ram is then driven hydraulically with sufficient pressure to force
the metal through a hard alloy-steel die. The solid metal section issues
from the die in a manner similar to the flow of toothpaste from its tube.
Using this process, a wide variety of sections can be produced, including
round rod, hexagonal brass rod (for parting off as nuts), brass curtain rail,
small-diameter rod (for drawing still further to wire), tubes in many alloys
including stainless steels; and many hollow stress-bearing sections in alu-
minium alloys (mainly for aircraft construction).

The most serious defect from which extruded sections suffer is called
the 'extrusion defect' or 'back-end defect', because of its occurrence in the
last part of the section extruded. It is caused by some of the surface scale
of the original billet being drawn into the core of the section by the turbu-
lent flow of metal in the container of the extrusion press. A number of
methods are effective in reducing it, including the 'indirect' process of
extrusion, where, in effect, the die is pushed into the billet, instead of, as
in the ordinary direct process, the billet being forced through the die. In
the latter process there will be relative movement between the billet and
the walls of the container, setting up a turbulent flow of metal due to
frictional forces, and so drawing surface scale into the main stream of
extruded metal. Since relative movement between billet and container is
reduced to a minimum in the indirect process, frictional forces are much
smaller. Consequently, not only is less turbulence produced in the surface
layers of the metal being extruded but also the power requirements are
less than in the direct process where much more energy is lost in overcom-
ing friction between the skin of the billet and the surface of the container.
Cold-working Processes

the necessary intermediate annealing stages, is applied only in the case of

a few alloys. These include both alloys which are very malleable in the
cold and, on the other hand, those which become weak and brittle when
heated.
Cold-working is more often applied in the finishing stages of production.
Then its functions are:
(a) to enable accurate dimensions to be attained in the finished
product;
(b) to obtain a clean, smooth finish;
(c) in some cases to straighten the work piece;
(d) by adjusting the amount of cold-work in the final operation after
annealing, to obtain the required degree of hardness, or 'temper', in
alloys which cannot be hardened by heat-treatment.
Raising the temperature of an alloy generally increases its malleability,
but reduces its ductility because tensile strength falls as the temperature
increases. This causes the metal to tear apart in tension before appreciable
extension has occurred. Thus in hot-working processes we are always push-
ing the alloy into shape, whilst in cold-working operations we frequently
make use of the high ductility of some alloys when cold, by pulling them
into their required shapes. Therefore, processes involving the pulling or
'drawing' of metal through a die are always cold-working operations.
There are many cold-working processes, but the principal ones used in
metallurgical industries are discussed below.
6.41 Cold-rolling Cold-rolling is applied during the finishing stages of
production of both strip and section and also in the production of very thin
materials such as foil. The type of mill used in the production of the latter
is shown in Fig 6.9. Here small diameter rolls must be used in order to
produce any reduction in the already thin material. Moreover, since the
sheet may be a metre or more in width the rolls must consequently be long
and therefore liable to bend under the considerable roll pressures which

6.42 Drawing of Solid and Hollow Sections Drawing is exclusively
a cold-working process, since it relies entirely on the high ductility of the
material being drawn and ductility is low at high temperatures. Both solid
sections and tubes are produced by drawing through dies, and all wire is
manufactured by this process. In the manufacture of tubes the bore may
be maintained by the use of a mandrel, as shown in Fig. 6.10. Rods and
tubes are drawn at a long draw-bench on which a power-driven 'dog' pulls
the material through the die. Wire, and such material as can be coiled, is
pulled through the die by winding it on to a rotating drum or 'block'. In
each case the material is lubricated with oil or soap before it enters the
die.
are necessary. This bending is minimised by using some system of backing
rolls as in the four-high mill illustrated. In most other cases cold-rolling
mills are similar in design to those used for hot-rolling.
The production of mirror-finished metal foil is carried out in rolls
enclosed in an 'air-conditioned' cubicle, and the rolls themselves are
polished frequently with clean cotton wool. Only by working in perfectly
clean surroundings, with highly polished rolls, can really high-grade foil be
obtained.
In addition to quality of finish, the objects of cold-rolling are accuracy
of dimensions and the adjustment of the correct temper in the material.

Fig. 6.10 A draw-bench for the cold-drawing of tubes.
Drawing dies (Fig. 6.11) are made, for different purposes: from high-
carbon steel; from tungsten and molybdenum steels; from tungsten carbide
(a tungsten carbide 'pellet' enclosed in a steel case); and, for very fine
gauge copper wire, from diamond.

6.43 Cold-pressing and Deep-drawing These processes are so
closely allied to each other that it is very difficult to define each separately.
The operations range from making a suitable pressing in one stage to
cupping followed by a number of re-drawings, as shown in Fig. 6.12. In
each case the components are produced from sheet stock, and range from
mild-steel motor-car bodies to cartridge cases (70-30 brass), bullet envel-
opes (cupro-nickel) and aluminium milk churns.
Deep-drawing demands very high ductility in the sheet stock, and only
a limited range of alloys are, therefore, available for the process. The best
known are 70-30 brass, cupro-nickel, pure copper, pure aluminium and
some of its alloys, and some of the high-nickel alloys. Mild steel can be
pressed and, to a limited extent, deep-drawn. It is used in the manufacture
of innumerable motor-car and cycle parts by these methods.

Typical stages in a deep-drawing process are shown in Fig. 6.12, but it
should be noted that wall-thinning may or may not take place in such a
process. If wall-thinning is necessary, then one of the more ductile alloys
must be used. Though Fig. 6.12 shows the processes of shearing and
primary cupping as being effected in different machines, usually a combi-
nation tool is used, so that both processes take place in one machine.
Cold-pressing is very widely used, and alloys which are not quite suf-
ficiently ductile for deep-drawing are generally suitable for shaping by
simple press-work. Of recent years high-energy rate forming by the use of
high explosives has also been developed (12.91—Part II).
Fig. 6.12 
Stages in the cupping and deep-drawing of a component.
6.44 Coining Coining, or embossing, is really a cold-forging process
and, as its name implies, it is used for the production of coinage, medallions
and the like. It has also been used on an experimental scale for producing
engineering components to exact dimensions. A malleable alloy is essential
for this type of process if excessive wear on the dies is to be avoided.
Embossing is similar in principle except that no variation in thickness of
the work piece is produced. It involves only light press work as in the
forming of military buttons and badges.
6.45 Spinning Spinning is a relatively simple process in which a circu-
lar blank of metal is fixed to the spinning chuck of a lathe. As the blank
rotates, it is forced up into shape by means of hand-operated tools of blunt
steel or hardwood, supported on a hand-rest. The function of the hand-tool

is to press the metal into contact with a former of the desired shape. This
former is also fixed to the rotating chuck.
The operation is in some respects similar to that of a potter's wheel in
which the lump of clay is replaced by a flat disc of metal. Large reflectors,
aluminium teapots and hot-water bottles, and other domestic hollow-ware
are frequently produced by spinning.
Sintering from a Powder
6.50 This method of producing metallic structures has become increas-
ingly important in recent years, and is particularly useful when there is a
big difference in the melting points of the metals to be alloyed, or when a
metal has an extremely high melting point. As an example, products con-
taining a high proportion of tungsten (m.pt 34100C) are usually formed by
sintering, since this metal is difficult and expensive to melt on a commercial
scale.
6.51 The metal to be sintered is obtained as a fine powder, either by
grinding; by volatilisation and condensation; or by reduction of its pow-
dered oxide. Any necessary mixing is carried out, and the mixed powdered
metals are then placed in a hardened steel die and compressed. The pres-
sures used vary with the metals to be sintered, but are usually between 70
and 700 N/mm2. As the metal particles rub together under these high
pressures a degree of cold welding occurs between them at some points on
the surfaces of contact. The brittle compressed mass is then heated in an
electric furnace to a temperature which will cause sintering to take place
and produce a mechanically satisfactory product. This sintering is depen-
dent upon grain-growth taking place across the incipient cold-welds which
occurred during pressing.
6.52 Tungsten is compacted and sintered in this way and the resulting
sintered rod is drawn down to wire for the manufacture of electric-lamp
filaments. The demand by engineers for tools which would be superior to
high-speed steels for cutting and machining metals led to the development
of sintered tungsten carbide products. Tools of this type are made by
mixing tungsten carbide powder with up to 13% of powdered cobalt; the
mixture is pressed into blocks and heated in a hydrogen atmosphere to a
temperature of 700-10000C. After this treatment the blocks are still soft
enough to be cut and ground to the required shape. They are then heated
in hydrogen to a temperature of 1400-15000C, when sintering takes place,
producing a material harder than high-speed steel. The function of cobalt is
to provide a tough, shock-resistant, bonding material between the tungsten
carbide particles. In addition to their use in cutting tools, cemented car-
bides of this type are employed in dies, other wear-resistant parts, per-
cussion drills and armour-piercing projectiles. When making tools for
machining steels, particularly with fine cuts or at high speeds, up to 20%
titanium carbide may be incorporated.
6.53 Sintering is also used to produce an even distribution of some
insoluble constituent in a metallic structure. In so-called oil-less bearings

powdered graphite is compressed with powdered copper and tin to make
a bronze bearing which is, as a result, impregnated with graphite. This is
then sintered at about 8000C which is of course well above the melting
point of tin which consequently melts and infiltrates the copper particles
effectively 'soldering' them together. Thus the manufacture of bronze bear-
ings differs from a true powder metallurgy process in this respect. Whilst
still hot the bearings are quenched in lubricating oil. Such treatment results
in a structure resembling a metallic sponge, which, when saturated with
lubricating oil, produces a self-oiling bearing. In some cases the amount
of oil held in the bearing is sufficient to last the lifetime of the machine.
These self-lubricating bearings are used in the automobile industry, but find
particular application in many domestic articles, such as vacuum cleaners,
electric clocks and washing-machines; in all of which, long service with a
minimum of maintenance is necessary.
The Machinability of Metals and Alloys
6.60 The mechanical forming operations already mentioned in this chap-
ter are often classified by engineers as 'chipless-forming' processes. Many
metal-shaping procedures however, rely on metal cutting. The consider-
able technology of these cutting processes is too vast a field to be described
here and is properly the province of the production engineer. Nevertheless
microstructure has considerable influence upon the ease with which a
material can be machined and that aspect will receive a brief mention.
Machinability, or the ease with which a material may be machined, may
be measured in a number of ways. It can be assessed as the energy required
to remove unit volume of the work piece or the thrust required to remove
material at a given rate. It may also be measured in terms of tool life. In
each case standard conditions must be prescribed.
Machining is really a cold-working operation in which the cutting edge
of the tool forms chips or shavings of the material being machined, and
the process will be facilitated if minute cracks form just in advance of the
cutting edge, due to high stress concentrations set up by the latter. Very
ductile alloys do not machine well, because local fracture does not occur
easily under the pressure of the cutting tool. Instead, such alloys will spread
under the pressure of the tool and 'flow' around its edge (Fig. 6.13(i)), so
that it becomes buried in the metal. Friction then plays its part, leading to
the overheating and ultimate destruction of the cutting edge.
6.61 It follows, therefore, that a brittle alloy will be far more suitable
for machining than would a ductile one. On the other hand, a brittle
alloy will generally be unsuitable in ultimate service, particularly under
conditions of shock. However, we can compromise by introducing what is,
in effect, local brittleness in an alloy, whilst at the same time producing
little or no deterioration in the impact toughness of the material as a whole.
Work-hardening of the surface as in the case of 'bright-drawn steel' rod
will produce this local brittleness but a more effective way of increasing

Fig. 6.13 The influence on machinability of isolated particles in the microstructure.
machinability is to introduce a suitable concentration of small isolated
particles into the microstructure.
6.62 Such particles, whether of hard or soft material, have the effect
of setting up stress concentrations locally, as the cutting edge approaches
them. A minute fracture will therefore travel from the cutting edge to the
particle in question, (Fig. 6.13(ii)), thus reducing friction between the tool
and the material being cut. In addition to the reduction of wear on the tool,
there will also be a reduction in the overall power required. Moreover, due
to the discontinuity introduced by the particles, the swarf produced will be
in small, conveniently sized pieces, instead of the long, curly slivers
obtained when a ductile material is machined. In fact, from some of the
free-cutting materials, such as leaded brasses, the swarf produced is more
in the nature of a powder.
6.63 Many alloys having a duplex structure will fall naturally into the
free-cutting or semi-free-cutting class. The slag fibres in wrought iron, the
graphite in cast iron and particles of a hard compound (16.42) in a high-tin
bronze are examples in which the presence of inclusions improves machin-
ability. In many cases, however, a deliberate addition must be made in
order to introduce such isolated particles. In the cheaper free-cutting steels
the presence of sulphur is utilised by ensuring that sufficient manganese is
also present to combine with the sulphur and form manganese sulphide.
Manganese sulphide exists as isolated globules in the microstructure,
whereas the iron (II) sulphide, which would form if manganese were
absent, would exist as brittle intercrystalline films. Thus, whilst in a good-
quality steel of the ordinary type sulphur is usually present only in amounts
less than 0.06%, in a free-cutting steel as much as 0.20% sulphur may be
present, the manganese content being raised to between 0.90 and 1.20%
to ensure that all the sulphur is combined with manganese.
6.64 Some alloys, whether in the liquid or solid state, will not dissolve
lead. It therefore exists as isolated globules scattered at random in the
microstructure instead of being distributed as intercrystalline films, as is
often the case when liquid solubility followed by solid insolubility leads to
the segregation of a constituent at the crystal boundaries (4.41). Particles
distributed in this globular form cause a relatively small deterioration in
the mechanical properties.

Lead is used in this way to improve the machinability of steels as well
as of non-ferrous alloys (in particular, brasses and bronzes), but whereas
the amounts used are in the region of 1.0-3.0% in brass, in steels the
amounts are only of the order of 0.15-0.35%, so that the particles of lead
are so small that they are not generally visible using a simple microscope.
These 'Ledloy' steels can be either of the plain carbon or alloyed type and,
as shown in Table 6.1, machinability is improved by up to 35% (in terms
of relative machinability constants) for alloy steels. The use of lead is
particularly advantageous in introducing free-cutting properties into such
alloys as the 13% chromium stainless steels, because the alternative
method of utilising the presence of sulphur and manganese may lead to a
reduction in the impact value by half, and a general reduction in other
mechanical properties.
6.65 Elements other than manganese are sometimes added in the pres-
ence of sulphur to improve machinability. Molybdenum or zirconium,
together with 0.1% sulphur, will produce non-abrasive sulphide globules.
Selenium is sometimes used to replace sulphur, particularly in the austen-
itic stainless steels. Selenium is chemically very similar to sulphur, and
forms selenide globules which act as chip breakers in the same way as
sulphide globules. Some typical steels containing the elements mentioned
are shown in Table 6.2.

of brasses, bronzes and nickel silvers is improved in this way. The lead
exists as tiny globules, plainly visible in the microstructure (Plate 6.2B).
Since lead is insoluble in the liquid alloys, as well as in the solid, care has
to be exercised to prevent segregation during the melting and casting of
such alloys.
Although the initial cost of leaded brasses is high compared with some
free-cutting steels, it must be realised that the very fine powdery swarf
produced from leaded brasses gives a high tool life. Moreover, since the

swarf is compact it can be handled easily, economically transported and
re-melted, so that its 'scrap-return value' is high. These factors mitigate
the initial high cost of leaded brass.

which are to improve machinability, also rely on the isolation of constitu-
ents in globular form so that they act as chip formers in this general
manner.

An Introduction to Steel
7.10 The military or industrial power of a nation has long been associated
with its ability to produce steel. The might of sixteenth-century Spain was
not unconnected with the quality of Toledo steel blades whilst in Britain
at about that time the introduction of laws limiting the felling of trees for
charcoal production, testified to the quantity of steel then being manufac-
tured. Later, the growth of the Industrial Revolution in Britain gave her
world supremacy in steel production as a result of the development of iron
and steel making by Dud Dudley and Abraham Darby and, subsequently,
by Huntsman, Bessemer, Gilchrist and Thomas. Towards the end of the
great Victorian era Britain was manufacturing most of the world's steel
and ruling an Empire on which the 'sun never set'.
During the present century depletion—and eclipse—of our home ore
supplies combined with the development of vast ore deposits overseas has
completely altered the situation. The USA and the CIS (formerly the
USSR) owe their material power largely to the presence of high-grade iron
ore within, or near to, their own considerable territories putting them
among the world leaders in steel production. Britain currently occupies
eleventh position behind the CIS, Japan, the USA, PR China, Germany,
Italy, Republic of Korea, Brazil, the Benelux Group and France having
fallen from the third position she held in the 'steel league' at the end of
the Second World War. Many other countries too are increasing their
steel-making capacities, generally from ore deposits within their own terri-
tories, so that outputs are approaching that of Britain. Of the big steel
producers West Germany and Japan, as well as Britain, have to import a
large proportion of their ore requirements.
7.11 The highest quality iron ores are the oxides magnetite, Fe3C>4, and
heamatite, FezCb, some deposits of the former containing almost 70% of
the metal. British home-produced ore is low-grade material of the carbon-
ate or hydroxide type, high in phosphorus and containing as little as 20%
iron. Fortunately it occurs near to the surface as 'sedimentary' deposits
which can be mined by open-cast methods. For this reason three-quarters
of the ore used in British blast furnaces has to be imported in the form of

high-grade concentrates from Swedish Lapland, Africa, Canada or Vene-
zuela. The principal ore producing countries are (in order of production):
CIS, PR China (and DPR Korea), Brazil, Australia, the USA, India,
Canada, South Africa, Sweden, Venezuela, Liberia, Mauretania and
France.
Pig Iron Production
7.20 The smelting of iron ore takes place in the blast furnace (Fig. 7.1).
This is a shaft-type furnace some 60 m or more in height and having an
output capacity of up to 10 000 tonnes per day. The refractory lining of
such a furnace is designed to last for several years since once the furnace
goes 'on blast' it would not be economical to shut down for re-lining.
Production takes place on a 365 days-a-year basis, though 'damping down'
—with the blast turned off or reduced—has to be used for interruptions
such as strikes.
Ore, coke and limestone are charged to the furnace through the double
bell-and-cone gas-trap system, whilst a pre-heated air blast is blown in
through tuyeres near the base of the furnace. In order to reduce coke
consumption still further and also increase furnace output fuel oil is some-

times injected with the air blast. At regular intervals of several hours both
tap hole and slag hole are opened in order to run off, first the slag and
then the molten pig iron. The holes are then re-plugged with clay.
7.21 The smelting operation involves the following main chemical
reactions:
(i) Coke in the region of the tuyeres burns completely—
C + O2 -• CO2 + Heat (Exothermic)
Just above the tuyeres the carbon dioxide is reduced by the white-hot
coke to carbon monoxide—
CO2 +C-* 2CO - Heat (Exothermic)
On balance the overall reaction is strongly exothermic, so that the tempera-
ture remains high.
(ii) As the carbon monoxide, which is a powerful reducing agent, rises
through the charge it reduces the iron(III) oxide (in the ore)—
Fe2O3+ 3CO-.2Fe+ 3CO2
(The reduction occurs in three stages: Fe2O3—»Fe3O4-^FeO-^Fe.) This
reaction takes place in the upper part of the furnace where the temperature
is too low for the iron so formed to melt. It therefore remains as a spongy
mass until it moves down into the lower part of the furnace where it
melts and runs down over the white-hot coke dissolving carbon, sulphur,
manganese, phosphorus and silicon as it goes. Apart from carbon—which
is absorbed from the coke—these elements are dissolved following their
reduction from compounds present as impurities in the original ore.
(iii) At the same time as this reduction is taking place, the earthy waste
or 'gangue' associated with the ore combines with lime (formed by the
decomposition of limestone added with the charge) to produce a fluid slag:
CaCO3 -• CaO + CO2
Limestone 
Lime
2CaO + SiO2 -• 2CaO-SiO2
Calcium silicate (slag)
The function of the lime here is to liquefy the gangue. The latter, being
composed largely of silica, would not melt at the blast-furnace temperature
and must therefore be attacked chemically to form a low melting-point
slag which will run from the furnace.
7.22 The furnace is tapped at regular intervals, the iron generally being
stored in the molten state in a 'mixer' prior to transfer to the steel-making
plant. Some may be cast as 'pigs' for subsequent re-melting.
In the early days of this century an average blast furnace produced about
100 tonnes of pig iron per day but modern furnaces with outputs of 10 000

tonnes per day are in operation both here and abroad. The approximate
quantities of materials in both charge and products for the daily
'throughput' of a medium sized blast furnace would be:

The slag produced is of low value and is used mainly for 'filling' purposes
—railway ballast, road making, concrete aggregate and for the manufac-
ture of slag wool (for thermal and accoustic insulation). It should not be
confused with the 'basic slag' used in agriculture which is a by-product of
steel-making processes.
One item in the above table which may surprise the reader is the enor-
mous volume of both air and resultant blast-furnace gas involved in the
production of a tonne of pig iron. An upwards flow of gas on this scale
demands a very porous charge in the furnace to allow the passage of gas.
For this reason the bulk of the ore used and particularly powdery imported
'concentrates', have to be 'agglomerated' before being charged to the
furnace. This involves sintering the fine material to produce strong large
lumps. Any fine ore or dust is blown out at the top of the furnace by the
upwards rush of gas. The coke too must be strong enough so that it does
not crush under the enormous pressure of the charge. Hence special cok-
ing-coal is used in its production.
7.23 The blast-furnace gas contains considerable amounts of carbon
monoxide which remain unused during reduction of the ore. Since the gas
has a useful calorific value the blast furnace performs a secondary role as
a giant gas producer and all of this gas is utilised as fuel. After being
cleaned of dust much of it is burned in the Cowper stoves which, in turn,
pre-heat the in-going air blast. Two such regenerator stoves are required
for each blast furnace. One is being re-heated by the burning blast-furnace
gas whilst the other is pre-heating the in-going air. The surplus gas is
utilised in many ways in an integrated steel-making plant, eg for raising
electric power or for firing different types of re-heating furnace used
around the plant.
7.24 Pig iron is a complex alloy. In addition to iron it contains up to
10% of other elements, the chief of which are carbon, silicon, manganese,
sulphur and phosphorus. These elements are absorbed as the reduced iron
melts and runs down through the white-hot coke and slag. The total
amount of carbon is usually 3-4% and it may be present either as iron
carbide, Fe3C (also called cementite) or as un-combined carbon {graphite).
A high silicon content of 2.5% or more favours the formation of graphite
during solidification so that a fractured surface of the solid iron is grey and
the iron is called a 'grey iron'. A low silicon content on the other hand,
say 0.5%, will favour the formation of iron carbide, Fe3C, during solidifi-

cation and the resultant iron will be a 'white iron' since the fractured
surface will show white iron carbide. However, the rate of solidification of
the iron also affects the formation of either graphite or iron carbide as it
does in cast iron (15.30). Some grades of pig iron—generally those low in
sulphur and phosphorus—are used for the manufacture of iron castings
but the bulk of pig iron produced is transferred, still molten, to the steel-
making plant.
7.25 Direct Reduction Processes The increasing scarcity of coke
suitable for use in the blast furnace has led to the development of alterna-
tive methods of iron production. Whilst the bulk of iron produced still
comes from the blast furnace, these new methods of iron production will
doubtless become much more important during the next two decades.
In some of these processes 'pelletised' high-grade ore is fed continuously
into a slowly rotating kiln which is fired by natural gas or other hydro-
carbons. The fuel provides the necessary heat and also carbon monoxide
which effects chemical reduction of the ore:
Fe2O3 + 3CO -> 2Fe + 3CO2
In a similar process the ore is contained in enclosed retorts through
which a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen—derived from natural
gas—circulates. Having reduced the ore in the first retort, the 'diluted' gas
is then burned to heat the second retort, and so on. Moving-grate furnaces
are also used to carry the ore through a reducing flame provided by the
partial combustion of natural gas.
The processes mentioned briefly above employ gaseous fuels to heat and
reduce the charge, but in other methods cheap solid fuels such as coke
breeze or even lignite are used. The product of these processes is known
as 'sponge iron'. It is reasonably pure iron but unfortunately is still mixed
with the gangue present in the original ore. Since this gangue is mainly
silica it must be fluxed with lime when the sponge iron is subsequently
remelted for steel making.
7.26 Electric Iron Smelting Processes These are also used where
coke is expensive, relative to the cost of electricity, as in Scandinavia.
These processes more nearly resemble blast-furnace smelting except that
heat is supplied by an electric arc rather than by coke, though low-grade
coke is used as the reducing agent. The coke is mixed with the ore and fed
into a reaction hearth where carbon electrodes provide the heating current.
The ore is reduced by the hot coke:
Fe2O3 + 3C -* 2Fe + 3CO
Unlike the direct reduction processes mentioned above where sponge iron
is produced, the end-product here is a molten pig iron. The gas leaving
the reduction chamber is very rich in carbon monoxide so it is cleaned and
used as an energy source in the same way as blast-furnace gas.
Electric smelting of iron has the advantage that it produces less carbon
dioxide, whereas for every tonne of pig iron tapped from the blast furnace

some 3.5 tonnes of CO2 finds its way—by whatever route—into the atmos-
phere. Thus a large blast furnace producing 10 000 tonnes of pig iron per
day is responsible for discharging into the environment about 12 million
tonnes of CO2 every year. This joins the outflow of all other carbon-
burning enterprises in promoting the 'greenhouse effect'.
An alternative method of smelting iron would seem to be by using hydro-
gen as a reducing agent:
Fe2O3 + 3H2 -> 2Fe + 3H2O (which ultimately falls as tain)
The hydrogen would be provided by the electrolysis of water, using
electricity from nuclear power. This is very expensive, and the anti-nuclear
lobby would react; but do we have any long-term choice if the Earth itself
is not to 'go critical' in a rather different sense? In the short term a much
more efficient reclamation of scrap steel would help. Instead we allow
millions of tonnes to rust and 'escape' into the environment every year.
The Manufacture of Steel
7.30 Prior to the introduction of the first blast furnaces during the four-
teenth century, iron had always been reduced as a solid metal by heating
a mixture of the ore and charcoal in a hearth-type furnace. Quite small
hand-powered bellows were used to provide the air blast and the tempera-
ture attained was not high enough to melt the iron released by chemical
action from the ore. Instead particles of iron, mixed with large amounts
of slag, collected at the bottom of the hearth. These porous masses, called
blooms, were then hammered so that much of the molten slag was expelled
and a bar of relatively pure iron containing some remnant slag particles
was the result. By repeatedly forge-welding such bars together and reham-
mering into a new bar, the slag particles were elongated into fibres
(Pl. 11.1B) and wrought iron was produced. Later the reduction hearth
was replaced by a small shaft-type furnace and much larger bellows were
driven by water power. The temperature reached was sufficient to melt
the reduced iron and so the first pig iron ran from a blast furnace. This pig
iron was then remelted in an open hearth so that the impurities were
oxidised and relatively pure iron, of consequently higher melting point,
crystallised out. This was then forged to produce wrought iron as before.
Oxidation of the remelted pig iron in this way was later known as
'puddling'.
Being of quite high chemical purity wrought iron had a good resistance
to corrosion as is shown by examples of nineteenth-century shipbuilding.
Thus the hull of the four-masted sailing ship Munoz Gamer0 built in 1875
but now lying at Punta Arenasin, Chile, shows a remarkably high state of
preservation of her puddled iron plates.
7.31 By the Middle Ages wrought iron had been manufactured, by one
method or another, for some four thousand years and it is reasonable to
suppose that sooner or later some ancient craftsman would have noticed

that 'wrought iron' could be hardened by cooling it in water provided that
it had been heated in a charcoal fire for a sufficiently long time. This
ultimately led to the manufacture of steel by what was later called the
Cementation Process. Bars of wrought iron were packed into stone boxes
along with charcoal and heated at about 9000C for a week. Carbon diffused
into the solid wrought iron* and the product was forged to give a more
homogeneous steel. Such production methods were expensive and steel
was used only as a tool material. In the meantime wrought iron continued
to be used for structural and constructional work and was not finally aban-
doned until the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 when it was probably quite
wrongly blamed for the collapse of the railway bridge.
7.32 In 1742 Benjamin Huntsman, a Sheffield clock maker, decided
that his clock springs were breaking because they lacked homogeneity, due
largely to the presence of slag in the wrought iron from which the cemen-
tation steel had been manufactured. He therefore melted bars of cemen-
tation steel so that most of the slag was lost. In this way he ultimately
perfected crucible cast steel for which Sheffield became justly famous.
7.33 Modern mass-production methods of steel manufacture began in
1856 when Henry Bessemer attempted to speed up wrought-iron manufac-
ture by blowing air through a charge of molten pig iron contained in a
pear-shaped 'converter'. Due to the high rate of the chemical reactions
involved in the oxidation of impurities such as carbon, silicon and mangan-
ese in the pig iron, the temperature ran so high that, instead of solid pure
iron crystallising out, the final product remained molten in the converter
and had to be cast. After preliminary difficulties had been overcome,
low-carbon steel suitable for constructional purposes became available for
the first time and soon the Bessemer process was established for the mass-
production of steel.
Since the Bessemer process was a very rapid production method—the
complete 'blow' lasted some half-hour—there was little time available to
control the composition and quality of the product. This led to the intro-
duction of the open-hearth process by Siemens-Martin in 1865. In this
process pig iron could be melted and refined along with large quantities of
steel scrap which was becoming available towards the end of the nineteenth
century. The main advantage however, was that the complete refining
process in the open-hearth took some eight to ten hours so that there was
ample time for control and adjustment of the composition of the product.
Until 1878 only those pig irons low in sulphur and phosphorus were
suitable for steel making since, unlike silicon, manganese and carbon, these
impurities were not oxidised and removed in the slag. Then came the
research of Thomas and Gilchrist which enabled large quantities of high-
phosphorus pig iron available in Britain to be converted to steel. To
achieve this they added lime to the furnace charge thus producing a basic
slag which would combine with phosphorus after the latter had been
oxidised:
* The process was similar in principle to modern methods of carburising for case-hardening (19.20).

Calcium phosphate
This calcium phosphate joined the basic slag.
Thus both the Bessemer and open-hearth processes flourished in Britain
and, subsequently, elsewhere for almost a century. In either case the pro-
cess was said to be 'acid' or 'basic'. The acid processes were so called
because they utilised low-phosphorus pig irons and therefore did not
require the addition of lime to the charge. The slag formed was acid since
it contained an excess of silica (derived from oxidised silicon) and to match
this the furnace was lined with silica bricks. Those pig irons rich in phos-
phorus required the charge to be treated with lime and this produces a
basic slag. This basic slag would quickly attack ordinary acid silica brick
furnace linings and so furnaces used in basic steel making had to be lined
with a basic refractory such as 'burnt' magnesite (MgO) or 'burnt' dolomite
(MgO.CaO).
7.34 As low-phosphorus ore became scarce in Britain more and more
steel was produced by basic processes. Gradually the basic open-hearth
became the dominant steel-making process because of its capability of
producing high-quality steel from high-phosphorus raw materials. Never-
theless vast quantities of mild steel continued to be made by the Bessemer
process; though one of its chief disadvantages was that since only the
impurities present in the initial pig iron were available as fuel, to keep the
charge molten during the 'blow' no scrap could be added and the pig iron
composition had to be between close limits.
Of the air blown into the Bessemer converter only 20% by volume had
a useful function in oxidising the impurities. This of course was the oxygen.
The remaining 80% (mainly nitrogen) entered the converter cold and
emerged as hot gas, thus carrying heat away from the converter and reduc-
ing the thermal efficiency of the process. Moreover small amounts of nitro-
gen dissolved in the steel during the 'blow'. This increased the hardness of
the product and frustrated the demand for mild steel of increasing ductility
by the motor-car manufacturers and others.
7.35 In 1952 a new approach to these problems was made in steel plants
at Linz and Donnawitz in Austria. Here, instead of blowing air through
molten pig iron as in the Bessemer process, pure oxygen was injected into
the surface of molten pig iron via a water-cooled 'lance'. This process—
called the L-D process—was made possible by the introduction of cheap
'tonnage' oxygen and though this was the first major steel-making process
not to be developed in Britain, it is only fair to say that Bessemer had
been aware of the advantages of using oxygen rather than air in his original
process. Unfortunately in the nineteenth century oxygen was far too expen-
sive to produce on a large scale.
Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS)
7.36 Following the introduction of L-D steelmaking in 1952 a spate of
modifications of the process followed. Thus both the Kaldo process

(Sweden) and the Rotor process (West Germany) were popular for a time
and it is inevitable that variations of the general oxygen method will
continue to be developed. Up to the time of publication all such modifi-
cations have had the following features in common:
(i) an oxygen blast is used to oxidise impurities in the original raw
material, these oxidised impurities being drawn off in the slag;
(ii) the processes are chemically basic so that phosphorus removal is
effective.
The BOF (basic oxygen furnace) is a pear-shaped vessel of up to 400
tonnes capacity, lined with magnesite bricks covered with a layer of dolo-
mite. Scrap is first loaded into the converter followed by the charge of
molten pig iron. Oxygen is then blown at the surface of the molten charge
through a water-cooled lance which is lowered through the mouth of the
converter (Fig. 7.2).
As soon as the oxidising reaction commences lime, fluorspar and millscale
are admitted to the converter to produce a slag on the surface which will
collect the impurities oxidised from the charge. At the end of the 'blow'
the slag is run off first and the charge of steel then transferred to a ladle
for casting as ingots.
BOS has the following major advantages over competing processes:
(i) It is rapid—the cycling time is about forty-five minutes;
(ii) Nitrogen contamination is very low so that deep-drawing quality
mild steel is produced;
Fig. 7.2 Stages in the manufacture of steel in a BOF.
The water-cooled oxygen lance may be up to 0.5m in diameter and its tip between 1 and
3m above the surface of the charge—depending upon the composition of the latter.

(iii) Thermal efficiency is high because heat is not carried away by
nitrogen as in the former Bessemer process. Hence the charge may
include 40%—and in some circumstances 50%—scrap;
(iv) A wide variety of both scrap and pig iron can be used.
The development of BOS has rendered the Bessemer process completely
obsolete whilst the open-hearth process is now used only in Eastern
Europe, India and a few Latin American plants.
Electric Arc Steelmaking
7.37 This is the only alternative steelmaking process which is significant
at present and its operation is complementary to BOS rather than competi-
tive. Originally electric-arc furnaces were used for the manufacture of small
amounts of high-grade tool steels and alloy steels. In a modern integrated
steel plant it is widely used to melt process scrap and other medium-grade
material which can be bought cheaply and then up-graded to produce very
high-quality steel. By this means the high cost of electrical energy is largely
offset. As electricity offers a chemically neutral method of providing heat,
the chemical conditions in the furnace can be altered at will to produce
either oxidising or reducing slags. The latter favour the removal of sulphur
from the charge, making the process one in which sulphur removal is
definite.
The furnace (Fig. 7.3) employs carbon rods which strike an arc on to
the charge. The lining is basic allowing the addition of lime and millscale
in order to produce a basic oxidising slag for the effective removal of
phosphorus from the charge as well as any remnant silicon or manganese.
Often the slag is then removed to be replaced by a basic reducing slag
composed of lime, anthracite and fluorspar. This removes sulphur from
the charge:

Hence the main advantages of the arc process are:
(i) Removal of sulphur is reliable;
(ii) Conditions are chemically 'clean' and contamination of the charge
is impossible;
(iii) Temperature can be accurately controlled;
(iv) Carbon content can be adjusted between fine limits;
(v) The addition of alloying elements can be made with precision.
Currently about a quarter of Britain's steel production comes from elec-
tric processes. The remainder is from BOS.
The Microstructural Nature of Carbon Steels
7.40 Despite the development of many sophisticated alloys in recent
years ordinary steel seems likely to remain the most important engineering
alloy available. Hence it has been considered desirable to make a prelimi-
nary study of the structures and properties of carbon steels at this stage in
preparation for a more detailed study later in the book.
It is impossible adequately to study the structure of a steel, or any other
alloy, without reference to what are called 'thermal equilibrium diagrams'
—or 'phase diagrams'. Probably some readers will have been introduced
to the iron-carbon thermal equilibrium diagram during preliminary studies
of materials science. The purpose of this chapter is to clarify such ideas as
those readers may have formulated on the subject and also to introduce
other readers to this important field of physical metallurgy. Both phase
diagrams in general, and that for iron and carbon in particular, will be
discussed in succeeding chapters. We will begin by studying the method of
construction and also the interpretation of a simple thermal equilibrium
diagram by reference to some tin-lead alloys.
7.41 Most readers will be aware that there are two main varieties of
tin-lead solder. Best-quality tinman's solder contains 62% tin and 38%
lead* and its solidification begins and ends at the same temperature—
183°C (Fig. 7.4(iii)). Plumber's solder, however, contains 33% tin and 67%
lead, and whilst it begins to solidify at about 265°C, solidification is not
complete until 183°C (Fig. 7.4(i)). Between 265 and 183°C, then, plumber's
solder is in a pasty, partly solid state which enables the plumber to 'wipe'
a joint with the aid of his 'cloth' (20.21).
From observations such as these it can be concluded that the temperature
range over which a tin-lead alloy solidifies depends upon its composition.
On further investigation it will be found that an alloy containing 50% tin
and 50% lead will begin to solidify at 2200C, and be completely solid at
183°C; whilst one containing 80% tin and 20% lead will begin to solidify
at 2000C and finish solidifying at 1830C.
From the data accumulated above we can draw a diagram which will
indicate the state in which any given tin-lead alloy (within the range of
* Whilst for reasons of economy tinman's solder often contains less than 62% tin (20.21), the latter
composition is ideal, since the solder will melt and freeze quickly at a fixed temperature.

compositions investigated) will exist at any given temperature (Fig. 7.5).
This diagram has been obtained by plotting the temperatures at which the
alloys mentioned above begin and finish solidifying, on a temperature-
composition diagram. All points—a\, a2, a3, a4—at which the various alloys
begin to solidify, are joined, as are the points—b\, bi, b3, b4—where
solidification is complete.
Any alloy represented in composition and temperature by a point above
AEB will be in a completely molten state, whilst any alloy similarly rep-
resented by a point below CED will be completely solid. Likewise, any
alloy whose temperature and composition are represented by a point
between AE and CE or between EB and ED will be in a part liquid-part
solid state.

'equilibrium' in this thermodynamical context will become apparent as a
result of later studies in this book, but for the moment we will consider an
everyday example which goes some way to illustrate its meaning.
On a hot summer's day we can produce a delightfully refreshing drink
by putting a cube of ice into a glass of lager. The contents of the glass,
however, are not in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, and as
heat-transfer takes place into the lager the ice ultimately melts and the
liquid warms up, so that the whole becomes more homogeneous if less
palatable. Rapid cooling, as we shall see later, often produces an alloy
structure which, like the ice and lager, is not in thermal equilibrium at
room temperature. The basic difference between the ice-lager mixture and
the non-equilibrium metallic structure is that the former is able to reach
'structural' equilibrium with ease, due to the great mobility of the constitu-
ent particles, but in the case of the metallic structure rearrangement of the
atoms is more difficult, since they are retained by considerable forces of
attraction in an orderly pattern in a crystal lattice. A non-equilibrium
metallic structure produced by rapid cooling may therefore be retained
permanently at room temperature.
7.43 If we assume that a series of alloys has been cooled slowly enough
for structural equilibrium to obtain, then the thermal-equilibrium diagram
will indicate the relationship which exists between composition, tempera-
ture and microstructure of the alloys concerned. By reference to the dia-
gram, we can, for an alloy of any composition in the series, find exactly
what its structure or physical condition will be at any given temperature.
We can also in many cases forecast with a fair degree of accuracy the
effect of a particular heat-treatment on the alloy; for in modern metallurgy
heat-treatment is not a process confined to steels, but is applied also to
many non-ferrous alloys. These are two of the more important uses of the
thermal-equilibrium diagram as a metallurgical tool. Let us now proceed
with our preliminary study of the iron-carbon alloys, with particular refer-
ence to their equilibrium diagram.
7.50 Plain carbon steels are generally defined as being those alloys of
iron and carbon which contain up to 2.0% carbon. In practice most ordi-
nary steels also contain appreciable amounts of manganese residual from
a deoxidation process carried out prior to casting. For the present, how-
ever, we shall neglect the effects of this manganese and regard steels as
being simple iron-carbon alloys.
7.51 As we have seen (3.14), the pure metal iron, at temperatures
below 9100C, has a body-centred cubic structure, and if we heat it to above
this temperature the structure will change to one which is face-centred
cubic. On cooling, the change is reversed and a body-centred cubic
structure is once more formed. The importance of this reversible transfor-
mation lies in the fact that up to 2.0% carbon can dissolve in face-
centred cubic iron, forming what is known as a 'solid solution',* whilst
* We shall deal more fully with the nature of solid solutions in the next chapter, and for the present it
will be sufficient to regard a solid solution as being very much like a liquid solution in that particles of the
added metal are absorbed without visible trace, even under a high-power microscope, into the structure
of the parent metal.

in body-centred cubic iron no more than 0.02% carbon can dissolve in
this way.
7.52 As a piece of steel in its face-centred cubic form cools slowly and
changes to its body-centred cubic form, any dissolved carbon present in
excess of 0.02% will be precipitated, whilst if it is cooled rapidly enough
such precipitation is prevented. Upon this fact depends our ability to heat-
treat steels—and, in turn, the present advanced state of our twentieth-
century technology.
7.53 The solid solution formed when carbon atoms are absorbed into
the face-centred cubic structure of iron is called Austenite and the
extremely low level of solid solution formed when carbon dissolves in
body-centred cubic iron is called Ferrite. For many practical purposes we
can regard ferrite as having the same properties as pure iron. In most
text-books on metallurgy the reader will find that the symbol y ('gamma')
is used to denote both the face-centred cubic form of iron and the solid-
solution austenite, whilst the symbol a ('alpha') is used to denote both the
body-centred cubic form of iron existing below 9100C and the solid-solution
ferrite. The same nomenclature will be used in this book.
When carbon is precipitated from austenite it is not in the form of
elemental carbon (graphite), but as the compound iron carbide, FQ3C,
usually called Cementite. This substance, like most other metallic carbides,
is very hard, so that, as the amount of carbon (and hence, of cementite)
increases, the hardness of the slowly cooled steel will also increase.
7.54 Fig. 7.5 indicates the temperatures at which solidification begins
and ends for any homogeneous liquid solution of tin and lead. In the same
way Fig. 7.6 shows us the temperatures at which transformation begins and
ends for any solid solution (austenite) of carbon and face-centred cubic
iron. Just as the melting point of either tin or lead is lowered by adding each
to the other, so is the allotropic transformation temperature of face-centred
cubic iron altered by adding carbon. Fig. 7.6 includes only a part of the
whole iron-carbon equilibrium diagram, but it is the section which we
make use of in the heat-treatment of carbon steels. On the extreme left
of this diagram is an area labelled 'ferrite'. This indicates the range of
temperatures and compositions over which carbon can dissolve in body-
centred cubic (a) iron. On the left of the sloping line AB all carbon present
is dissolved in the body-centred cubic iron, forming the solid-solution fer-
rite, whilst any point representing a composition and temperature to the
right of AB indicates that the solid-solution a is saturated, so that some of
the carbon contained in the steel will be present as cementite. The signifi-
cance of the slope of AB is that the solubility of carbon in body-centred
cubic iron increases from 0.006% at room temperature to 0.02% at 723°C.
Temperature governs the degree of solubility of solids in liquids in exactly
the same way.
7.55 We will now study the transformations which take place in the
structures of three representative steels which have been heated to a tem-
perature high enough to make them austenitic and then allowed to cool
slowly. If a steel containing 0.40% carbon is heated to some temperature
above Ui it will become completely austenitic (Fig. 7.6(i)). On cooling

again to just below Ui (which is called the 'upper critical temperature' of
the steel), the structure begins to change from one which is face-centred
cubic to one which is body-centred cubic. Consequently, small crystals of
body-centred cubic iron begin to separate out from the austenite. These
body-centred cubic crystals (Fig. 7.6(ii)) retain a small amount of carbon
(less than 0.02%), so we shall refer to them as crystals of ferrite. As the
temperature continues to fall the crystals of ferrite grow in size at the
expense of the austenite (Fig. 7.6(iii)), and since ferrite is almost pure
iron, it follows that most of the carbon present accumulates in the shrinking
crystals of austenite. Thus, by the time our piece of steel has reached Li
(which is called its 'lower critical temperature') it is composed of approxi-
mately half ferrite (containing only 0.02% carbon) and half austenite,
which now contains 0.8% carbon. The composition of the austenite at this
stage is represented by E. Austenite can hold no more than 0.8% carbon
in solid solution at this temperature (723°C), therefore, as the temperature
falls still farther, the carbon begins to precipitate as cementite. At the
same time ferrite is still separating out and we find that these two sub-
stances, ferrite and cementite, form as alternate layers until all the remain-
ing austenite is used up (Fig. 7.6(iv)). This laminated structure of ferrite
and cementite, then, will contain exactly 0.8% carbon, so that it will
account for approximately half the volume of our 0.4% carbon steel. It is
an example of what, in metallurgy, we call a eutectoid (8.43). This particu-
lar eutectoid is known as Pearlite because when present on the etched
surface of steel it acts as a 'diffraction grating', splitting up white light into
its component spectrum colours and giving the surface a 'mother of pearl'
sheen. In order to be able to see these alternate layers of ferrite and
cementite of which pearlite is composed, a metallurgical microscope cap-
able of a magnification in the region of 500 diameters is necessary.
Any steel containing less than 0.8% carbon will transform from austenite
to a mixture of ferrite and pearlite in a similar way when cooled from its
austenitic state. Transformation will begin at the appropriate upper critical
temperature (given by a point on CE which corresponds with the compo-
sition of the steel) and end at the lower critical temperature of 723°C. The
relative amounts of ferrite and pearlite will depend upon the carbon con-
tent of the steel (Fig 7.7), but in every case the ferrite will be almost pure
iron and the pearlite will contain exactly 0.8% carbon.
7.56 A steel containing 0.8% carbon will not begin to transform from
austenite on cooling until the point E is reached. Then transformation will
begin and end at the same temperature (723°C), just as tinman's solder
solidifies at a single temperature (183°C). Since the steel under consider-
ation contained 0.8% carbon initially, it follows that the final structure will
be entirely pearlite (Fig 7.6(vi)).
7.57 A steel which contains, say, 1.2% carbon will begin to transform
from austenite when the temperature falls to its upper critical at Ui. Since
the carbon is this time in excess of the eutectoid composition, it will begin
to precipitate first; not as pure carbon but as needle-shaped crystals of
cementite round the austenite grain boundaries (Fig 7.6(viii)). This will
cause the austenite to become progressively less rich in carbon, and by the

time a temperature of 723°C has been reached the remaining austenite will
contain only 0.8% carbon. This remaining austenite will then transform to
pearlite (Fig 7.6(x)), as in the two cases already dealt with.
Any steel containing more than 0.8% carbon will have a structure con-
sisting of cementite and pearlite if it is allowed to cool slowly from its
austenitic state. Since the pearlite part of the structure always contains
alternate layers of ferrite and cementite in the correct proportions to give
an overall carbon content of 0.8% for the pearlite, it follows that any
variation in the total carbon content of the steel above 0.8% will cause a
corresponding variation in the amount of primary cementite present. (The
terms 'primary cementite' and 'primary ferrite' are used to denote that
cementite or ferrite which forms first, before the residual austenite trans-
forms to pearlite.)
A plain carbon steel which contains less than 0.8% carbon is generally
referred to as a hypo-eutectoid steel, whilst one containing more than
0.8% carbon is known as a hyper-eutectoid steel. Naturally enough, a plain
carbon steel containing exactly 0.8% carbon is called a eutectoid steel.
7.60 So far we have been dealing only with the types of structure
produced when plain carbon steels are cooled slowly from the austenitic
condition. Such conditions prevail during industrial processes such as
normalising and annealing. By very rapid cooling from the austenitic con-
dition, such as would be obtained by water-quenching, another structure,
called Martensite, is formed. This does not appear on the equilibrium
diagram simply because it is not an equilibrium structure. Rapid cooling
has prevented equilibrium from being reached.
7.61 As most readers will already know, martensite is very hard indeed.
Unfortunately it is also rather brittle, and the steel is used in this condition
only when extreme hardness is required. To increase the steel's toughness
after quenching (at the expense of a fall in hardness) the steel can be
tempered. A modification in the structure will take place depending upon
the tempering temperature. This temperature will vary between 250 and
6500C according to the combination of mechanical properties required in
the finished component. Whatever temperature is used, tempering assists
the microstructure to proceed in some measure back towards equilibrium,
with the precipitation of microscopical particles of cementite in varying
amounts from the original martensitic structure. The type of structure
formed by tempering at about 4000C was formerly known as Troostite,
whilst that produced in the region of 6000C used to be called Sorbite.
Metallurgists now discourage the use of these terms for reasons which will
be explained later when the heat-treatment of steel is discussed more fully
in Chapters 11 and 12.
The Uses of Plain Carbon Steels
7.70 By varying the amount of carbon in a steel, and by selecting a
heat-treatment programme suited to that carbon content, we are able to
produce a vast range of different mechanical properties such as are avail-

able in no other metallic alloy. Moreover, carbon steel is a relatively inex-
pensive alloy when compared with non-ferrous alloys generally. Small
wonder then that steel is by far our most important engineering alloy.
Possibly its most serious fault is that it rusts and we must often spend
considerable amounts of money on protecting its surface from atmospheric
corrosion (21.10).

As shown in Fig. 7.7, the hardness of a plain carbon steel increases
progressively with increase in carbon content, so that generally the low-
and medium-carbon steels are used for structural and constructional work,
whilst the high-carbon steels are used for the manufacture of tools and
other components where hardness and wear-resistance are necessary.
Commercial plain carbon steels may be classified into five groups as
indicated in Table 7.1 which, along with Fig. 7.7, indicates some of the
common uses of these alloys.

The Formation of Alloys
8.10 Pure metals are rarely used for engineering purposes except where
high electrical conductivity, high ductility or good corrosion resistance are
required. These properties are generally at a maximum value in pure
metals, but such mechanical properties as tensile strength, yield point and
hardness are improved by alloying. In most cases the manufacture of an
alloy involves melting two or more metals together and allowing the mix-
ture to solidify in a suitably-shaped mould. The main object of this chapter
is to study the type of microstructure which is produced when the alloy
solidifies.
8.11 Broadly speaking, we are only likely to obtain a metallurgically
useful alloy when the two metals in question dissolve in each other in the
liquid state to form a completely homogeneous liquid solution. There are
exceptions to this rule, as, for example, the suspension of undissolved lead
particles in a free-cutting alloy (6.64). The globules of lead are undissolved
in the molten, as well as in the solidified alloy. In general however, a useful
alloy is formed only when the metals in question are mutually soluble in
the liquid state forming a single liquid which is uniform in composition
throughout.
8.12 When such a homogeneous liquid solution solidifies one of the
following conditions is possible:
(a) The solubility ends and the two metals which were mutually soluble
as liquids become totally insoluble as solids. They therefore separate out
as particles of the two pure metals.
(h) The solubility prevailing in the liquid state may be retained either
completely or partially in the solid state. In the former case a single solid
solution will be formed, whilst in the latter case a mixture of two different
solid solutions will result.
(c) As solidification proceeds the two metals give rise to what is loosely
termed an intermetallic compound but which in many cases might more
accurately be described as an intermediate phase.
8.13 Any one of the separate substances referred to in 8.12 is called a
phase. Thus a solid phase may be either a pure metal or a solid solution
8

or some intermediate phase of two or more metals so long as it exists in
the microstructure as a separate entity.
A law, based on thermodynamical considerations, and known as the
Phase Rule, was formulated originally in 1876 by Josiah W. Gibbs, Pro-
fessor of Mathematical Physics at Yale. Certain principles, derived from
this Phase Rule (9.24) are of use to us in a study of physical metallurgy.
For example, it can be demonstrated that in a solid binary* alloy not more
than two phases can co-exist. Therefore a binary alloy may contain:
(a) Two pure metals existing as separate entities in the structure. This
is a very rare occurrence, since in most cases there is a slight solubility
of one metal in the other.
(b) A single complete solid solution of one metal dissolved in the
other.
(c) A mixture of two solid solutions if the metals are only partially
soluble in each other.
(d) A single intermediate phase of some type.
(e) A mixture of two different intermediate phases.
(J) A solid solution and an intermediate phase mixed together—and
so on.
8.14 The general procedure in making an alloy is first to melt the metal
having the higher melting point and then to dissolve in it the metal with
the lower melting point, stirring the mixture so that a homogeneous liquid
solution is formed. When this liquid solidifies the type of structure which
is produced depends largely upon the relative physical and chemical
properties of the two metals and in part on their relative positions in the
Periodic Classification (1.69). If they are very near to each other in the
Periodic Table it is probable—though not inevitable—that they will form
mixed crystals (ie a solid solution) in which the atoms of each metal are
randomly placed in a common crystal pattern. This is rather like the effect
which would be produced if a bricklayer used both red and blue bricks
indiscriminately in building a wall. If the red and blue bricks were of
approximately equal size then a strong and reasonably regular wall would
result even though it looked a bit untidy due to the lack of pattern in
placing the different coloured bricks.
If the two metals are widely separated in the Periodic Table so that their
chemical properties, and probably their atomic sizes, differ considerably
then it is possible—but again, not certain—that they will combine to form
some sort of chemical compound (an 'intermetallic compound'). Between
these two extremes the atoms of the two metals may associate with each
other in different patterns to form transitional phases known collectively
as intermediate phases.
We will now consider in some detail the nature of the phases and struc-
tures mentioned above.
* Containing two metals.

The Solid Solution
8.20 A solid solution is formed when two metals which are mutually
soluble in the liquid state remain dissolved in each other after crystallis-
ation. If the resulting structure is examined, even with the aid of a high-
power electron microscope, no trace can be seen of the parent metals as
separate entities. Instead one sees crystals consisting of a homogeneous
solid solution of one metal in the other, and if the metals are completely
soluble in each other there will be crystals of one type only.
8.21 It will be clear that in order that one metal may dissolve in another
to form a solid solution, its atoms must fit in some way into the crystal
lattice of the other metal. This may be achieved by the formation of either
a 'substitutional' or an 'interstitial' solid solution (Fig. 8.1).
Fig. 8.1 Ways in which solid solution can occur.
8.22 Interstitial solid solutions can be formed only when the atoms of
the added element are very small compared with those of the parent metal,
thus enabling them to fit into the interstices or spaces in the crystal lattice
of the parent metal. Not only can this occur during solidification but, also
in many cases, when the parent metal is already solid. Thus, carbon can
form an interstitial solid solution with FCC iron during the solidification
of steel, but it can also be absorbed by solid iron provided the latter is
heated to a temperature at which the structure is face-centred cubic. This
is the basis of carburising steel (19.20). Nitrogen is also able to dissolve
interstitially in solid steel, making the nitriding process (19.40) possible;
whilst hydrogen, the atoms of which are very small indeed, is able to
dissolve in this way in a number of solid metals, usually producing mechan-
ical brittleness as a result.
8.23 In a substitutional solid solution the atoms of the solvent or parent
metal are replaced in the crystal lattice by atoms of the solute metal. This
substitution can be either 'disordered' or 'ordered' (Fig. 8.1). Solubility of
one metal in another is governed in part by the relative sizes of their atoms.
Thus disordered solid solutions are formed over a wide range of alloy
compositions when the atoms—or, properly, their positive ions—are of
similar size but when the atomic diameters differ by more than 14% of
DISORDERED

that of the atom of the solvent metal then solubility will be slight because
the atomic size factor is unfavourable.
The size factor effect arises from the strain which is induced in the crystal
lattice by a badly misfitting solute atom. The atoms of the solvent metal
are displaced either outwards or inwards according as the solute atom is
either larger or smaller than the atom of the solvent metal. This distortion
of the crystal lattice from the ideal shape increases the energy of the crystal
and tends to restrict solubility in it.
Electrochemical properties of the two metals also influence the extent
to which they will form a solid solution. Thus if the two metals have very
similar electrochemical properties, generally indicated by a close proximity
to each other in the Periodic Table, then they may form solid solutions
over a wide range of compositions but if one metal is very strongly electro-
positive and the other only weakly electropositive as shown by a wide
separation in the Table, then they are very likely to form some type of
compound.
As might be expected, the lattice structures of the two metals will influ-
ence the extent to which they are likely to form substitutional solid sol-
utions. If the structures are similar then it is reasonable to expect that one
metal can replace the other satisfactorily in its lattice. Thus two FCC metals
like copper and nickel will form a continuous series of solid solutions—
assisted by the fact that atom sizes of these two metals are almost the
same.
The valency of one metal relative to the other will also affect the tend-
ency to form a solid solution. A metal of lower valency is more likely to
dissolve one of higher valency than vice versa. Thus copper will dissolve
considerable amounts of many other metals giving useful ranges of solid
solution alloys.
To summarize, a high degree of substitutional solid solubility between
two metals is likely to be obtained when:
1. The difference in atomic radii is less than 14%.
2. Electrochemical properties are similar.
3. The two metals have similar crystal structures.
Even though the size factor of the two metallic atoms may favour their
forming a solid solution they are more likely to form compounds if one is
much more strongly electropositive than the other.
When a disordered solid solution crystallises from the liquid state there
is a natural tendency for the core of the dendrite to contain rather more
atoms of the metal with the higher melting point, whilst the outer fringes
of the crystal will contain correspondingly more atoms of the metal of
the lower melting point. Nevertheless, within such a 'cored' crystal, once
formed, diffusion does take place; and this diffusion tends to produce
uniform distribution of each kind of atom. Diffusion is only appreciable at
relatively high temperatures, for which reason a rapidly cooled alloy will be
appreciably cored and a slowly cooled alloy only slightly cored. Prolonged
annealing will remove coring completely by allowing diffusion to take place
and produce a uniform solid solution. The driving force behind diffusion
is the reduction in strain energy produced by the fact that as solute atoms

move away from regions of high concentration the overall distortion of the
crystal is reduced. The effects of the phenomena of coring and diffusion
are illustrated in Fig. 8.2.
8.24 In an interstitial solid solution diffusion can take place with rela-
tive ease, since the solute atoms, being small, can move readily through
the crystal lattice of the parent metal, but in substitutional solid solutions
the mechanism of diffusion is still open to speculation. It was stated earlier
(4.15) that faults can occur in crystals, giving rise to dislocations which
facilitate slip. Similarly, it is suggested that what are called 'vacant sites'
can exist in a metal crystal. These are positions in the crystal lattice which
are not occupied by an atom (Fig. 8.3).
Since there is always some difference in size between the solute atoms
and the atoms of the parent metal, the presence of a solute atom will cause
some distortion in the lattice of the parent metal. This distortion will be
minimised by the association of a solute atom with a vacant site as shown
in Fig. 8.4A. The associated pair of vacant site with solute atom can migrate
easily through the crystal in stages as indicated in Fig. 8.4 B-F. The rate of
diffusion will depend to some extent upon the number of vacant sites, but
also upon the concentration gradient of the solute atoms within the struc-
ture of the solvent metal (Fig. 8.6); and upon the temperature at which
diffusion is taking place. The general result will be for solute atoms to
diffuse away from regions of high concentration towards regions of low

concentration and diffusion will ultimately cease when a uniform distri-
bution of solute atoms has been achieved.
The Schottky defect (3.62) is formed by a similar progressive movement
of atoms to that described above, whereby a vacancy is left behind in the
lattice and a corresponding atom is deposited at the surface of the metal.
Such a process takes place due to internal strains within the lattice.
8.25 As long ago as 1855 Adolph Fick proposed rules governing the dif-
fusion of substances in general. Here we are concerned with their application
to diffusion in metallic alloys. Fick's Law states that the flow or movement
(J) of atoms across unit area of a plane (Fig. 8.5) at any given instant is
— 
at the same instant
but of opposite sign, ie,
Here Z), the diffusion coefficient, is a constant for the system but will
vary for other compositions of alloy. It is in units ^ en£—*- and is usually
time
expressed as 10~4m2/s. The significance of the negative sign preceding D is
that the movement of solute atoms is taking place 'down' the concentration
gradient.
When - j = 0 , then / = O and this satisfies the requirement that diffusion
ceases when the concentration gradient reaches zero as the solid solution
becomes homogeneous (line CD in Fig. 8.6). In practice coring is never
completely eliminated. It is reduced quite rapidly in the early stages of an
annealing process but traces still remain even after prolonged treatment
—mathematically of course CD (Fig. 8.6) only becomes horizontal after
an infinitely long time interval. Traces of coring are however generally
acceptable in most industrial processing.
Here we have considered diffusion in only one direction—parallel to the
jc-axis in which the concentration gradient is operating. In practice diffusion
will also take place along y and z axes.

Fig. 8.6 AB is the initial concentration gradient and CD the concentration gradient after a
long time during which diffusion has been taking place.
There are similarities in principle between Fick's Law and other Laws
such as Ohm's Law. The concentration gradient operates in a similar way
to potential difference as the driving force and D is independent of the
value of j— in the same way as electrical resistance is independent of
potential difference. Similar principles also govern heat flow through solids
where thermal conductivity is independent of the magnitude of the tem-
perature gradient. All such properties, ie electrical and thermal conduc-
tivities, viscosity and diffusion are known as transport properties of a
substance.
Fick's Law assumes that diffusion is proceeding under steady-state con-
ditions and that the concentration gradient at any given point will not
change with time. That is, we are as it were 'feeding in' solute atoms at
one end of a piece of alloy and extracting an equal number at the other
end. In practice this will not be the case and in a given piece of alloy matter
will be conserved: its overall or 'average' composition remains constant
and only the positions of its atoms vary in terms of x and t.
Consider the situation where, due to coring in an alloy, a certain distri-
bution of concentration is set up and that subsequently, due to heat activa-
tion (eg annealing), the atoms diffuse so as to attempt to reach a uniform
concentration (eliminate coring). Concentrations are therefore changing
with time and atoms must be accumulating in the region between plane Xo
and plane (JCO + dx) or moving from it (Fig. 8.5). Hence the number
crossing area A of the plane, xo, is not equal to that crossing the same area
at (JCO + dx). The flux entering this section is:

used to be known as Fick's Second Law of Diffusion but is now more
generally referred to as The diffusion equation. Since c depends upon x
and t it could be written as c(Xf t).
In this system of three equations (1) is an experimental law linking the
flow of atoms at any point with the concentration gradient there, (2) is the
continuity equation expressing the fact that atoms cannot disappear whilst
(3) combines these two equations. Equation (1) applies only to steady-state
conditions where these conditions do not vary with time. Equation (3)
applies to the general case where the concentration gradient at a certain
plane changes with time. Values of bc/bt and b2c/bx2 can be determined
experimentally in order to determine the value of D for a given set of con-
ditions. Differential coefficients vary with the nature of the solute atoms, the
nature of the solvent structure and with temperature.
8.26 In Fig. 8.1, and the illustrations which follow, both solvent and
solute atoms in substitutional solid solutions have been shown of equal
size, whilst in interstitial solid solutions solute atoms have been shown as
very small and fitting easily into the interstices of the lattice. In the real
world such is not the case; both solvent and solute atoms have been rep-
resented in this way in order not to complicate the illustration unduly.

Atoms of different elements forming substitutional solid solutions will
never be of exactly the same size and for this reason some distortion of
the lattice structure of the parent metal will be caused by the presence of
atoms—whether larger or smaller—of the solute metal (Fig. 8.7(i)). Simi-
larly solute atoms of a size similar to those of the parent metal will sometimes
dissolve interstitially (Fig. 8.7(ii)). However, Fig. 8.7 does not represent the
situation completely since we are only describing the coplanar distribution
of atoms, ie along the x and y axes. In practice the distribution of solute
atoms and the distortion they produce will also occur along the z axis since
crystals are three-dimensional in nature.

Only a coplanar representation can be given here. In practice of course crystals are three-
dimensional.
Intermediate Phases
8.30 In the foregoing section we have been dealing with disordered substi-
tutional solid solutions in which there is no 'ordering' of the atoms of the
solute metal within the lattice of the solvent metal. Such solutions are
formed when the electrochemical properties of the metals are similar.
However, when two metals have widely divergent electrochemical proper-
ties they are likely to associate to form a chemical compound. Thus strongly
electropositive magnesium will combine with weakly electropositive tin to
form the substance Mg2Sn. This is generally described as an intermetallic
compound. Between these two extremes of substitutional solid solution on
the one hand and intermetallic compound on the other, phases are formed
which exhibit a gradation of properties according to the degree of associ-
ation which occurs between the atoms taking part. These phases are collec-
tively termed intermediate phases. At one extreme we have true
intermetallic compounds whilst at the other ordered structures which can
be more accurately classed as secondary solid solutions.
8.31 These intermediate phases can be classified into three main
groups:
1 Intermetallic compounds in which the laws of chemical valence
are apparently obeyed as in Mg2Sn, Mg2Pb, Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Bi2. These
valence compounds are generally formed when one metal (such as mag-

nesium) has chemical properties which are strongly metallic, and the
other metal (such as antimony, tin or bismuth) chemical properties which
are only weakly metallic and, in fact, bordering on those of non-metals.
Frequently such a compound has a melting point which is higher than
that of either of the parent metals. For example, the intermetallic com-
pound Mg2Sn melts at 7800C, whereas the parent metals magnesium and
tin melt at 650 and 232°C respectively. This is an indication of the high
strength of the chemical bond in Mg2Sn.
2 Electron Compounds As was shown earlier (1.70) the chemical
valence of a metal is a function of the number of electrons in the outer
'shell' of the atom, whilst the nature of the metallic bond is such that
wholesale sharing of numbers of electrons takes place in the crystal
structure of a pure metal.
In these 'electron compounds' the normal valence laws are not obeyed,
but in many instances there is a fixed ratio between the total number of
valence bonds of all the atoms involved and the total number of atoms
in the empirical formula of the compound in question.
There are three such ratios, commonly referred to as Hume-Rothery
ratios:
(i) Ratio 3/2 (21/14)—(3 structures, such as CuZn, Cu3Al, Cu5Sn,
Ag3Al, etc.
(ii) Ratio 21/13—y structures, such as Cu5Zn8, G19AI4, Cu3iSn8,
Ag5Zn8, Na3iPb8, etc.
(iii) Ratio 7/4 (21/12)—e structures, such as CuZn3, Cu3Sn, AgCd3,
Ag5Al3, etc.
Thus, in the compound CuZn, copper has a valence of 1 and zinc a
valence of 2, giving a total of 3 valences and hence a ratio of 3 valences
to 2 atoms. In the compound Cu3iSn8 copper has a valence of 1 and tin
a valence of 4. Therefore 31 valences are donated by the copper atoms
and 32 (ie, 4 X 8) by the tin atoms, making a total of 63 valences. In
all, 39 atoms are present in the empirical formula of Cu3iSn8 therefore
the ratio
Total number of valences 
63 
21
Total number of atoms 
39 
13
These Hume-Rothery ratios have been valuable in relating structures
which were apparently unrelated. There are, however, many electron
compounds which do not fall into any of the three groups mentioned
above, nor are they valence compounds. Electron compounds are
formed as a result of the nature of the metallic bond and the stability of
such a substance depends upon electron concentration and the lattice
structure involved.
3 Size-factor Compounds These are intermediate phases in which
compositions and crystal structures arrange themselves in such a way as
to allow the constituent atoms to pack themselves closely together.
In the Laves phases compositions are based upon the general formula
AB2, eg MgNi2, MgCu2, TiCr2 and MnBe2. Their formation depends

upon the fact that the constituent atoms vary in size by about 22.5% but
that they can none the less pack closely together in crystal structures.
A very important group of size-factor compounds are the interstitial
compounds formed between some transition metals and certain small non-
metallic atoms. When the solid solubility of an interstitially dissolved
element is exceeded a compound is precipitated from the solid solution.
In this type of compound the small non-metal atoms still occupy interstitial
positions but the overall crystal structure of the compound is different from
that of the original interstitial solid solution. Compounds of this type have
metallic properties and comprise hydrides, nitrides, borides and carbides
of which TiH2, TiN, Mn2N, TiB2, TaC, W2C, WC, Mo2C and Fe3C are
typical. All of these compounds are extremely hard and the carbides find
application in tool steels and cemented-carbide cutting materials. Fe3C is
of course the phase cementite of ordinary carbon steels. Many of these
carbides are extremely refractory, having melting points well in excess of
300O0C.
8.32 Many intermediate phases are extremely hard and brittle so that
a small ingot of such a substance may often be crushed to a powder by
gentle pressure in the jaws of a vice. This is particularly true of valence
compounds where covalent or ionic bonds tend to replace the metallic
bond, thus making the substance essentially non-metallic in its properties
as indicated by brittleness and a low electrical conductivity. Consequently
such phases are of limited use in engineering alloys and then in relatively
small proportions of the total microstructure.
Small quantities of intermediate phases—usually electron compounds—
are generally present in bearing alloys. Here the hard particles of com-
pound are embedded in a matrix of tough solid solution. The compound
resists wear and has a low coefficient of friction, whilst the solid solution
provides the necessary tough matrix capable of withstanding mechanical
shock and high compressive forces.
Intermediate phases are often easy to identify as such under the micro-
scope. Frequently they are of an unexpected colour but this is explained
by the fact that crystal structures and lattice distances are different from
those of the parent metals. (Lattice distances control the wavelength of
light reflected from a surface.) Thus Cu3iSn8 is pale blue whilst Cu2Sb is
bright purple. Since intermediate phases are of ordered structure, coring
is not present and the microstructure appears uniform.
8.33 The good high-temperature properties of many of th£ stable inter-
metallic compounds suggests that they could be used as engineering
materials, particularly in the aerospace industries, but for their low ductility
and extremely poor impact toughness. Nevertheless research is now in
progress with a view to improving ductility and hence 'fabricability' of
some of the more promising compounds.
Thus the compound Ni3Al has a melting point of 13900C and an ordered
FCC structure. Single crystals of the compound are very ductile, as are most
FCC structures (4.12), but in the normal polycrystalline state it suffers from
extreme grain-boundary brittleness. The addition of as little as 0.05%

boron raises the percentage elongation from zero to 50 as the fracture
mode is changed from being intercrystalline to a mixture of intercrystalline
and transcrystalline. Formability is therefore dramatically improved. This
effect is probably due to the segregation of boron at the crystal boundaries
causing some disorder in the boundary region. Stresses due to dislocation
'pile-ups' there are more evenly distributed and can be relieved by slip
across the boundary rather than by fracture along the boundary only.
Eutectics and Eutectoids
8.40 When two metals which are completely soluble in the liquid state
but completely insoluble in the solid state solidify, they do so by crystallis-
ing out as alternate layers of the two pure metals. Thus a laminated type
of structure is obtained and is termed a eutectic. This eutectic mixture is
always of a fixed composition for the two metals concerned and it melts at
a temperature below the melting points of either of the metals.
Consider the two metals cadmium and bismuth which are completely
soluble in each other as liquids but completely insoluble as solids. If
increasing amounts of cadmium are added to bismuth then the freezing
point of bismuth (TIl0C) is progressively depressed (along AE in Fig. 8.8).
Similarly if increasing amounts of bismuth are added to cadmium then the
freezing point of cadmium (321°C) decreases progressively (along BE).
These depression-of-freezing point lines meet at a minimum in E which is
called the eutectic point. This indicates the composition of the eutectic
mixture (60% wt. Bi/ 40% wt. Cd) and also the temperature (1400C) at
which it freezes. The relative thicknesses of the layers of bismuth and
cadmium will be so adjusted as to give an overall eutectic composition as
indicated by E. Suppose the overall composition of a bismuth-cadmium
alloy were given by X. This indicates that bismuth is present in the molten
alloy in excess of the eutectic composition. Therefore some bismuth will
crystallise out first until by the time that the temperature has fallen to
TEMPERATURE 
0C
COMPOSITION (°/owt.)

OBi

1400C the remaining liquid will be of composition E. This liquid will then
crystallise out as eutectic. Similarly if the overall composition of the initial
liquid mixture were given by Y then some cadmium would solidify first until
the remaining liquid were of composition E. Eutectic would then form as
before, ie as alternate layers of pure bismuth and pure cadmium. The
mechanism of this type of crystallisation will be discussed more fully in the
next chapter (9.40).
8.41 In a eutectic of two pure metals there is no question whatsoever
of solution, since the layers of the pure metals forming the eutectic can be
seen quite clearly under the microscope, at magnifications usually between
100 and 500, as definite separate entities. The formation of the eutectic is
therefore a result of insolubility being introduced when the alloy solidifies.
At this point it must be admitted that it is very doubtful whether com-
plete insolubility exists in the solid state in any alloy system. There is nearly
always some solid solubility however slight it may be. However, if the two
metals in question are partially soluble in each other in the solid state, we
may still obtain a eutectic on solidification, but it will be a eutectic
composed of alternate layers of two saturated solid solutions. One layer
will consist of metal A saturated with metal B, and the other a layer of
metal B saturated with metal A. This statement may at first cause some
confusion in the mind of the reader, but it must be understood that the
two layers are not one and the same as far as composition is concerned,
since one layer is rich in metal A and the other is rich in metal B. Consider
as a parallel case in liquid solutions the substances water and ether. If a
few spots of ether are added to a test-tube nearly filled with water and the
tube shaken, a single solution of ether in water will result. If, on the other
hand, a few spots of water are added to a test-tube nearly filled with ether,
and the tube shaken, a single solution of water in ether will result. When,
however, we put into the test-tube equal volumes of ether and water and
again shake, we find that we are left with two layers. The upper layer will be
ether saturated with water, and the lower layer will be water saturated
with ether. The upper layer is a solution containing most of the ether, and
the lower layer a different solution containing most of the water. We have
a similar situation in the case of metallic solid solutions, in that one phase
of a eutectic may be a solid solution rich in metal A and the other phase
a solid solution rich in metal B.
8.42 Not all eutectics, whether of pure metals or solid solutions, appear
under the microscope in the well-defined laminated form mentioned above.
Usually layers of one of the phases are embedded in a matrix of the other
phase, and quite often these layers are broken or disjointed. Fig. 17.2 illus-
trates the aluminium-silicon eutectic structure in which the thinner silicon
layers (the eutectic mixture contains only 11.7% silicon) are broken into
plate form and are embedded in an aluminium matrix. This is indeed fortu-
nate since silicon is brittle and if present as continuous layers would seriously
impair the properties of this very useful alloy.
Again, surface tension may influence crystallisation and the final eutectic
may consist of globules of one phase embedded in a matrix of the other.
The effect of surface tension will be accentuated by slow rates of cooling

which allow layers of one phase to break up; first, into smaller, thicker
plates, and ultimately, into rounded globules (Fig. 11.8).
8.43 Sometimes a solid solution which has already formed in an alloy
transforms at a lower temperature to a eutectic type of structure. When
this happens, the eutectic type of structure produced is called a eutectoid,
since it was not formed from a liquid solution like a eutectic, but from a
solid solution. The transformation of the solid solution, austenite, to the
eutectoid, pearlite (7.55), is an example of this type of change. Cementite
nuclei form at random at the crystal boundaries of the austenite, and these
nuclei initiate the growth of cementite plates in the direction in which the
concentration of carbon in the austenite is highest. As a result of the
extraction of the carbon from the surrounding austenite to form cementite,
ferrite will nucleate alongside the cementite. In this way cementite and
ferrite plates will develop alongside each other (Fig. 8.9)
Fig. 8.9 The mechanism of the austenite -» pearlite transformation.
If an alloy is cooled very rapidly from a temperature above that at which
the eutectoid begins to form, the solid solution (or possibly a modified
form of it such as martensite in steels) is often retained. This demonstrates
that the eutectoid has not formed from the liquid but had been produced
at a later stage.
8.50 Many useful alloys consist structurally of a single uniform solid
solution in which increased strength is developed as suggested in the follow-
ing section (8.60). Such alloys are generally also ductile and corrosion
austenite
cementite
ferrite

resistant (21.71). Yet other useful alloys are of duplex structure, that is,
they contain two different phases in the microstructure. These two different
phases may be solid solutions in a eutectic type of structure or they may
be a solid solution along with some form of intermediate phase. Since
many intermediate phases are weak and brittle it is usually only those
which are hard and fairly strong which find use in metallurgical alloys, and
then only in relatively small quantities. In addition to their use in bearing
alloys as already mentioned, such phases may be employed to increase
strength by some form of precipitation hardening process (9.92) or disper-
sion hardening mechanism (8.62).
It is the function of the metallurgist, by control of his alloy compositions
along with suitable mechanical and thermal treatments, to produce alloys
which will provide a set of physical and mechanical properties which fulfil
the requirements of the engineer.
Strengthening Mechanisms in Alloys
8.60 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the main reason for alloying
is to increase the yield strength of a metal. This involves impeding the
movement of dislocations by making alterations to the structure on
approximately the atomic scale.
8.61 Solid-solution Hardening In a cold-worked metal the presence
of a dislocation causes distortion of that part of the lattice structure near
to it. This distortion, and the energy associated with it, can be reduced by
the presence of solute atoms. Large substitutional solute atoms will reduce
distortion if they take up positions where the lattice structure is being
stretched (Fig. 8.10(i)) due to the presence of a dislocation; whilst small
substitutional solute atoms will have a similar effect if they replace solvent
atoms in regions where the lattice is being compressed (Fig. 8.10(ii)). When
these so-called 'atmospheres' of solute atoms are produced, the movement
of dislocations will be impeded and a greater stress must be applied to
move them. That is to say, the yield point has been raised.
In interstitial solid solutions the relatively small solute atoms will tend
to occupy positions where the lattice is being extended (Fig. 8.10(Hi)) since
Fig. 8.10 
The 'pegging' of dislocations by the presence of solute atoms.

interstitial gaps will be larger in these regions. This hypothesis affords an
explanation of the yield-point effect in mild steel (2.31), and was a signifi-
cant triumph in support of the dislocation theory in its earlier days.
In Fig. 8.11 the yield point, A, corresponds to the stress necessary to
move dislocations away from their atmosphere of interstitial carbon atoms
by which they have become anchored, whilst the point B indicates the stress
necessary to keep the dislocations moving once movement has begun.
This yield-point effect in mild steel causes non-uniform localised defor-
mation, which leads to the formation of 'stretcher strains' (or 'Luder's
lines') on the surface of such products as deep-drawn motorcar bodies.
Such markings disfigure the surface, and their formation is avoided by
applying slight initial deformation to the stock material, for example, by
means of a light rolling pass. As this deformation is taking place in com-
pression instead of in tension, stretcher strains will not form.
Assume that, during this treatment, the stock material was stressed to
the point X (Fig. 8.11). Since the material has now yielded, no further
yield point will be encountered during the subsequent deep-drawing pro-
cess. Thus, the stress-strain curve will follow XZ. If, however, the pre-
stressed steel is allowed to remain at room temperature for a few months,
or if it is heated to 3000C for a few hours, carbon atoms are able to move
back to their initial positions relative to the dislocations and form their
original 'atmosphere', so that the yield-point effect returns. Since there
are now more dislocations than were present in the original unstressed
material, the new yield point will be at Y. This effect, which is known as
'strain-ageing', can be caused by the presence of as little as 0.003% carbon
or nitrogen. It is sometimes used to strengthen springs after coiling, but
its effect in material destined for deep drawing must be avoided. Conse-
quently, such material is usually deep-drawn within twenty-four hours of
the pre-stressing operation mentioned above.
STRESS
Fig. 8.11.
8.62 Dispersion Hardening The presence of small separate particles
in the microstructure can impede the movement of dislocations provided
that these particles are stronger than the matrix in which they are embed-
ded. The degree of strengthening produced also depends on the size of
STRAIN

particles, their distance apart and the tenacity of the bond between par-
ticles and matrix. The passage of a dislocation through an alloy containing
isolated particles is represented in Fig. 8.12. Assuming that the particles
are stronger than the matrix, the dislocation cannot pass through them,
but if the stress is high enough, the dislocation can by-pass them leaving a
'dislocation loop' around each particle. This will make the passage of a
second dislocation much more difficult, particularly since dislocations have
greater difficulty in passing between particles which are near to each other.
Particles of a separate phase are often precipitated from a solid solution
during cooling. The cementite platelets in pearlite are an example, and
their presence effectively strengthens steel. Such particles which have sep-
arated to form their own individual crystal structures are referred to as
non-coherent precipitates. Prior to the actual precipitation of separate
particles, however, an intermediate state often exists where atoms associ-
ated with the solute material begin to form groups within the crystal lattice
of the solvent metal. These are small regions of less than one hundred
atoms on an edge, and are called 'coherent precipitates'. Although still
part of the continuous crystal structure of the matrix, they are attempting
to form their own separate crystals, which will have a different crystal
pattern. The presence of these coherent precipitates produces severe elas-
tic distortions which impede the movement of dislocations. They are gener-
ally more effective than non-coherent precipitates. The nature of coherent
precipitates, which give rise to the 'precipitation hardening' of some alu-
minium alloys, beryllium bronzes and a number of other alloys, will be
dealt with more fully later (9.92).

9.10 The subject of phase equilibrium was briefly discussed in Chapter
7 to introduce the reader to this very important field of study in as
painless a manner as possible. The reader will have acquired a general
impression of the significance of equilibrium diagrams, since no useful
examination of the microstructures of alloys is possible without reference
to the appropriate diagram, which, for this reason, becomes one of the
metallurgists most useful 'tools'. With its aid he can predict with precision
the structure of a given alloy at any given temperature provided that the
alloy's thermal-treatment history is known. In the thermodynamical sense,
'equilibrium' refers to the state of balance which exists, or which tends to
be attained, between the phases in the structure of an alloy after a chemical
or physical change has taken place. In some cases equilibrium may not be
reached for long periods after the change has begun. In fact, rapid cooling
(or 'quenching') to room temperature may suppress the chemical or physi-
cal change involved to such an extent that equilibrium will never be reached
so long as the alloy remains at room temperature. Reheating (or 'temper-
ing') followed by slow cooling to room temperature will allow the physical
or chemical change to proceed in some degree towards completion; the
extent to which equilibrium is thus attained being dependent upon the
temperature reached, the time the alloy remains at that temperature and
the rate of cooling to room temperature or at whatever other temperature
equilibrium is being studied.
9.11 We have already seen that physical and chemical changes which
take place after solidification in carbon steel do so with relative ease
because the small carbon atoms can move quickly through the crystal
lattice of face-centred cubic iron. Thus, during the process of normalising,
a steel will attain structural equilibrium. In some alloy systems, however,
physical changes which take place after solidification are so sluggish that
it is doubtful if equilibrium is ever attained. Often we have no means of
9

telling whether or not equilibrium has been reached, even after extremely
slow rates of cooling involving periods of days or even weeks. There is
therefore a tendency these days to refer to these charts as 'constitutional
diagrams' instead of 'thermal-equilibrium diagrams'. The latter term, how-
ever, is still in general use, and we shall employ it throughout this book.
9.12 The thermal-equilibrium diagram is in reality a chart which shows
the relationship between the composition, temperature and structure of
any alloy in a series. Let us consider briefly how these diagrams are con-
structed.
A pure metal will complete its solidification without change of tempera-
ture (3.12), whilst an alloy will solidify over a range of temperature which
will depend upon the composition of the alloy (7.41). Consider, for
example, a number of alloys of different composition containing the two
metals A and B which form a series of solid solutions (Fig. 9.1). For
successive compositions containing diminishing amounts of the metal A,
freezing commences at a\, <z2, «3, etc., and ends at bi, fc, b3, etc. Thus, if
we join all points ai, ai, a?>, etc., we shall obtain a line called the liquidus,
indicating the temperature at which any given alloy in the series will com-
mence to solidify. Similarly, if we join the points £>i, bi, ^3, etc., we have
a line, called the solidus, showing the temperature at which any alloy in
the series will become completely solid. Hence the liquidus can be defined
as the line above which all indicated alloy compositions represent com-
pletely homogeneous liquids, whilst the solidus can be defined as the line
below which all represented alloy compositions of A and B are completely
solid. For temperatures and compositions corresponding to the co-
ordinates of points between the two lines both liquid solutions and solid
solutions can co-exist in equilibrium.

each other in all proportions in both the liquid and solid states, as in the
case of copper and nickel or gold and silver. When, on the other hand,
the metals are completely insoluble in the solid state a eutectic type of
equilibrium diagram represents the system (Fig. 9.2). Since the eutectic
part of the structure of any alloy in the series solidifies at the same tempera-
ture, and is the portion of the alloy with the lowest melting point, the line
ACEDB will be the solidus whilst AEB is the liquidus.
9.14 Diagrams of this type can be constructed by using the appropriate
points (obtained from time-temperature cooling curves) which indicate
where freezing began and where it was complete. Thus the liquidus and
solidus temperatures for a number of alloys in the series between 100% A
and 100% B can be obtained and then plotted on a temperature-compo-
sition diagram as indicated in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2. Such cooling curves will
determine the positions of the liquidus and solidus; and if the alloy system
is one in which further structural changes occur after the alloy has solidi-
fied, then the metallurgist must resort to other methods of investigation
to determine the phase boundary lines. These methods include the use
of X-rays, electrical-conductivity measurements, dilatometric methods
(which measure changes in volume) and exhaustive microscopical examin-
ation following the quenching of representative specimens from different
temperatures.
9.15 The construction of equilibrium diagrams, then, is the result of
much tedious experimental work, and, since the conditions under which
the work is carried out can be so variable, it is not surprising that the
values assigned to compositions and temperatures at which phase changes
occur are under constant review by research metallurgists. The reader
will, therefore, find that the equilibrium diagrams printed in books on
metallurgy often differ in small detail. In general, however, the variations
are so small as not to affect the treatment of most of the industrially

important alloys. As an example, the accepted value for the carbon content
of a completely eutectoid carbon steel (7.55) has varied between 0.80 and
0.89% during recent years, whilst the eutectoid temperature (the lower
critical temperature of plain carbon steels) has varied between 698 and
732°C.
The Phase Rule
9.20 In the previous chapter a 'phase' was described as either a pure
metal, a solid solution or some form of intermediate compound so long
as it was a single homogeneous substance. Similarly a single element or
compound can exist in different physical forms, each one a separate phase.
Thus the chemical substance 'H2O' can exist as ice, water or water vapour,
each of these conditions constituting a 'phase'. The 'phase structure' of
H2O is governed by the prevailing conditions of temperature and pressure
as indicated in the phase diagram in Fig. 9.3. This diagram shows the effects
which variations of temperature and pressure will have on the stability of
a given phase. The 'fusion curve' is an almost vertical line and this indicates
that variation in pressure has very little effect on the melting point of ice.
The same is true of the effects of pressure on the melting points of alloys
for which reason we can neglect pressure when studying the phase equilib-
rium of liquid or solid alloys.
The 'vaporisation curve' however indicates that the boiling point of water
is very dependent on pressure. Water boils at 1000C when the pressure is
equivalent to 760 mm of mercury. If the pressure is reduced to, say, 300 mm
of mercury then water will boil at about 500C which is the reason why tea
cannot be brewed successfully near the summit of Everest.

The 'sublimation curve' shows that at low pressures solid ice can vaporise
—or 'sublime'—without passing through the liquid phase. Some sub-
stances, notably carbon dioxide ('dry ice') and iodine, do this at normal
atmospheric pressures when heated to the 'sublimation temperature'.
9.21 In 1876 Gibbs (8.13) introduced his Phase Rule which predicts
the relationship between the number of phases, the number of components
(or pure chemical substances) and the conditions of temperature and pres-
sure which prevail. The general form of the rule can be written:
P + F = C + E
where P = the number of different phases present;
C = the number of components (stable chemical substances);
F = the degrees of 'freedom', or 'variance';
E = the environmental factors (temperature and pressure).
9.22 The implications of this rule can be explained more easily by
reference to examples. Consider point A in Fig. 9.3. Here there is only
one phase in the system (water vapour) and one component (the chemical
compound, H2O) whilst there are two environmental factors (temperature
and pressure) to be considered. Hence, since—
P + F= C + E
1 + F= 1 + 2
ie 
F= 2
This means that two degrees of freedom are involved so that both tempera-
ture and pressure can be altered independently without altering the number
of phases in the system, which is consequently said to be bivariant.
Now consider the point B. This indicates that water is boiling at 1000C
and 760 mm pressure so we have two phases (water and water vapour)
present at the same time, but still one component (H2O). Applying the
Phase Rule:
2 + F= 1 + 2
or F= 1
This means that only one degree of freedom is available and if tempera-
ture is increased pressure must also be increased in sympathy if the water
is to continue to boil steadily. Conversely if, say, pressure were reduced
then the boiling point of water would decrease in sympathy so that con-
ditions were still represented by a point on the 'vaporisation curve'. Failure
to observe these conditions would mean that one phase would disappear
—either the water would cease to boil or it would turn very quickly to
steam. The system represented by B is said to be univariant.
At the triple point T all three phases, ice, water and water vapour can
exist together. Hence:

3 + F = 1 + 2
or F = O
In this case there is no degree of freedom and if either temperature or
pressure are altered then at least one of the phases will disappear. This
system is invariant.
9.23 We will now consider the Phase Rule as it applies to a study of
metallic alloys. Here the components in the system are pure metals or
elements from which the alloy is made, whilst the phases produced will
be either liquids, solid solutions, intermediate compounds or, rarely, pure
metals.
We are usually dealing with alloy systems in the liquid and solid states
at atmospheric pressure. Since small variations in atmospheric pressure
will have virtually no effect on the stability of phases we can neglect the
effect of pressure and standardise at 'one atmosphere'. As we are now
dealing with only one variable environmental factor, temperature, we can
adapt Gibbs' Phase Rule so:
P + F = C H - I
Moreover since one environmental factor has disappeared we can still
express a two-component system in a two-dimensional diagram, variation
in composition replacing variation in pressure. We will now examine such
a system (Fig. 9.4).
Point A represents a completely homogeneous molten alloy containing
a single liquid phase composed of the two components bismuth and cad-
mium. Hence:

There are two degrees of freedom so that both temperature and compo-
sition may be varied independently without altering the single-phase
structure.
On cooling the alloy to B the liquid becomes saturated with cadmium
so that solid cadmium begins to form. There are now two phases present
and:
2 + F =2+ 
1
and F = 1
Thus there is one degree of freedom and if the temperature is altered the
composition of the remaining liquid must alter so that B remains on CE.
At E solid cadmium and solid bismuth co-exist with remaining liquid so
that there are three phases and:
3 + F = 2 + 1
and F = 0
Therefore the system at E is invariant and any alteration of temperature
or composition will lead to the disappearance of at least one of the phases.
Conversely if the alloy of composition indicated by E is cooling, then the
temperature must remain constant until the liquid has crystallised com-
pletely. That is, a eutectic crystallises at a constant temperature.
9.24 In the interpretation of thermal equilibrium diagrams it is often
more convenient to make use of a set of definitions and rules which are
derived from Gibbs' Phase Rule and also from some observations made
by the French metallurgist A. Portevin:
(a) The areas of the diagram are called 'phase fields', and on crossing
any sloping boundary line from one field to the next, the number of
phases will always change by one, ie two single-phase fields will always
be separated by a double-phase field containing both of the phases. In
a binary system three phases can only exist together at a point, such as
the eutectic point E in Fig. 9.4.
(b) In Fig. 9.5 the point P represents some particular alloy mixture in
both composition and temperature. The diagram indicates that at P both
liquid and solid will exist together. If a 'temperature horizontal' (usually
known as a tie-line) is drawn through P the composition of the solid is
given by X, and the composition of the liquid solution in equilibrium
with it by Y. P itself represents the overall composition of the mixture.
(c) The relative amounts of both liquid and solid at P are given by the
relative lengths PX and 
PY-

This is generally referred to as the Lever Rule since it is as though we
were taking moments about P as the fulcrum. The relationship can be
expressed in more convenient form:

(usually an intermetallic compound) of invariable composition. In fact
the phase 'field' will be infinitely narrow such as is represented by the
100% bismuth ordinate in Fig. 9.4 or the Mg2Sn ordinate in Fig. 9.15.
(e) If we draw a vertical line on a diagram this will represent the
composition of a given alloy (X in Fig. 9.6). If, on following along this
line, a phase boundary is crossed (at O) the number of phases will change
by one at this point, ie a phase (|3) will be either precipitated or absorbed.
(In this instance (3 will be absorbed when the alloy X is heated above O
and precipitated again when the alloy X cools below O.)
We will now consider the main types of thermal equilibrium diagram
which are of use in studying metallic alloy systems. Generally a useful alloy
will only be formed when the two metals are completely soluble in each
other in the liquid state; but in some instances the two metals are only
partially soluble as liquids. We will begin with a brief study of one such
case.
Case I—Two metals which are only partially
soluble in each other in the liquid state
9.30 Fig. 9.7 represents the phase equilibrium conditions for the zinc-
lead system above 5000C. As in all of these equilibrium diagrams the base
line shows the composition varying between 100% of one component at
one side of the diagram to 100% of the other component at the opposite
side. In most diagrams the percentages are by weight but in some cases it
is more relevant to indicate percentages in terms of numbers of atoms.
The ordinate represents temperature. Thus point P represents a mixture
consisting of 70% by weight of zinc and 30% by weight of lead at a tempera-
ture of 7000C.
9.31 The diagram (Fig. 9.7) shows that at 5000C molten zinc will dis-
solve no more than 2% lead (point A) giving a single solution of lead in
zinc. At the same temperature molten lead will dissolve about 5% zinc
(point B) thus giving a single solution of zinc in lead. However, any alloy
at 5000C which has a composition given by some point between A and B
will consist of two separate layers of two different liquid solutions—the
upper layer will be zinc containing 2% dissolved lead (composition A) and
the lower layer will be lead containing 5% dissolved zinc (composition B).
9.32 The slope of the line ADJC indicates that as the temperature rises
lead becomes increasingly soluble in molten zinc. Similarly the slope of
BEC shows that, under similar conditions, the solubility of zinc in molten
lead also increases. These two solubility curves meet at 798°C indicating
that at temperatures above this, the two metals become completely soluble
in each other so that a single liquid phase will be present in the mixture
whatever its overall composition.
9.33 Consider a molten mixture consisting of 70% zinc and 30% lead
(composition H). At 5000C this will consist of a saturated layer of lead in

zinc (composition A) floating on top of a saturated layer of zinc in lead
(composition B). That is, it is a two-phase mixture.
If the temperature is now raised the amount of lead which dissolves in
zinc increases as does the amount of zinc which dissolves in lead. Thus at
7000C zinc will now dissolve 20% lead (composition D) whilst lead will
dissolve 20% zinc (composition E). Using the Lever Rule we can calculate
the relative proportions by weight of each layer:
Weight of zinc-rich layer 
Weight of lead-rich layer
(composition D)xDP= 
(composition E) x PE
Weight of zinc-rich layer (composition D) 
PE
Weight of lead-rich layer (composition E)

Weight of zinc-rich layer (80%Zn-20%Pb) _ 80-30
Weight of lead-rich layer (80%Pb-20%Zn) ~ 30-20

~T
As the temperature of this 70-30 mixture is raised still further to 752°C
the two liquid phases merge into one, as the two metals become completely
soluble in each other at this composition.

Case II—Two metals mutually soluble in all
proportions in the liquid state becoming
completely insoluble in the solid state
9.40 It is extremely doubtful whether such a situation as this really exists
in practice since most solid metals appear to dissolve quantities, however
small, of other metals. However, in the case of bismuth and cadmium the
mutual solid solubility is so small that we can neglect it for the sake of our
argument and assume that the metals are completely insoluble in the solid
state. Bismuth, a heavy, brittle, slightly pink metal, is one of the least
'metallic' of metals as indicated by its position near to the non-metals in
the Periodic Table. It forms a complex rhombic-type crystal structure in
which the metallic bond is partly replaced by a mixture of covalent bonds
and van der Waals forces. Cadmium on the other hand crystallises as a
normal CPH structure so that it is not surprising that these two metals with
such unlike lattice structures do not form mixed crystals but separate out
almost completely on solidification. The bismuth-cadmium thermal-
equilibrium diagram is shown in Fig. 9.8.
9.41 Let us consider the solidification of an alloy of composition x, ie
containing about 80% cadmium and 20% bismuth. When the temperature

falls to T, crystal nuclei of pure cadmium begin to form in accordance with
rule (b) stated in 9.24. (The temperature horizontal or tie-line, T, cuts the
liquidus at the chosen composition, x, and the other phase boundary is the
100% cadmium ordinate.) Since pure cadmium is deposited, it follows
that the liquid which remains becomes correspondingly richer in bismuth.
Therefore the composition of the liquid moves to the left—say, to x\—
and, as indicated by the diagram, no further deposition of cadmium takes
place until the temperature has fallen to Ti. When this happens more
cadmium is deposited, and dendrites begin to develop from the nuclei
which have already formed. The growth of the cadmium dendrites, on the
one hand, and the consequent enrichment of the remaining liquid in bis-
muth, on the other, continues until the temperature has fallen to 1400C.
The remaining liquid then contains 40% cadmium and 60% bismuth, ie
the eutectic point E has been reached.
At this point the two metals are in equilibrium in the liquid, but, due to
the momentum of crystallisation, the composition swings a little too far
past the point E, resulting in the deposition of a little too much cadmium.
In order that equilibrium shall be maintained, a swing back in composition
across the eutectic point takes place by the deposition of a layer of bismuth.
In this way the composition of the liquid oscillates about E by depositing
alternate layers of cadmium and bismuth, whilst the temperature remains
at 1400C until the remaining liquid has solidified. Thus the final structure
will consist of primary crystals of cadmium which formed between the
temperature T and 1400C, and a eutectic consisting of alternate layers of
cadmium and bismuth which formed at 1400C.
9.42 Had the original liquid contained less than 40% cadmium, then
crystals of pure bismuth would have formed first, causing the composition
of the remaining liquid to move to the right until ultimately the point E
was reached as before, and the final liquid contained 40% cadmium and
60% bismuth. This remaining liquid would solidify as eutectic in the
manner already described.
9.43 If the original liquid contained exactly 40% cadmium and 60%
bismuth at the outset, then no solidification whatever would occur until
the temperature had fallen to 1400C. Then a structure composed entirely
of eutectic would be formed as outlined above.
9.44 In all three cases mentioned, the eutectic part of the structure will
be of constant composition and will always contain 40% cadmium and 60%
bismuth. Any variation either side of this in the overall composition of the
alloy will be compensated for by first depositing appropriate amounts of
either primary cadmium or primary bismuth, whichever is in excess of the
eutectic composition. It is important to realise that there is no question
of solid solubility existing in any way in the final structure, whatever its
composition. With the aid of a microscope, we can see the two pure metals
cadmium and bismuth as separate constituents in the microstructure. In
other words, this is a case of complete insolubility in the solid state.

Plate 9.1 Part of the aluminium-nickel thermal equilibrium diagram which includes the
eutectic system between aluminium and the intermetallic compound NiAI3.
The photomicrographs of two representative alloys in the cast condition are shown. The 97-
3 alloy contains approximately equal amounts of primary aluminium crystals (the light areas)
and eutectic. The structure of the 90-10 alloy consists of primary NiAI3 crystals (dark) and
eutectic. Note the regular 'geometric' shape of the primary NiAI3 crystals—this is often a
feature of intermetallic compounds.
The light aluminium layers in the lamellar eutectic are much broader than those of the dark
NiAI3 because the eutectic composition contains only 5.7% nickel.
Case Ill—Two metals, mutually soluble in all
proportions in the liquid state, remain mutually
soluble in all proportions in the solid state
9.50 A number of pairs of metals fulfil these conditions and are generally
those in which:

(ii) the electrochemical properties of the two metals are very similar;
(iii) the crystal structures of the two pure metals are similar in pattern.
If these conditions are fulfilled it is reasonable to expect atoms of the
second metal to be able to replace atoms of the first in all proportions to
form a disordered solid solution. Such is the case in the alloy systems: Ag-
Au; Ag-Pd; Au-Pt; Bi-Sb; Co-Ni; Cu-Ni; Cu-Pt; Fe-Pt; Ni-Pt;
and Ta-Ti. (In some of these systems further phase changes occur in the
solid state due to polymorphic transformations (3.14)). Since the copper-
nickel alloys are the only ones of the group mentioned above which are of
use in engineering it is proposed to deal with this system. The cop-
per-nickel thermal-equilibrium diagram is shown in Fig. 9.9.
Again this is a simple type of equilibrium diagram, and since, as in the
cadmium-bismuth system, no transformations take place in the solid, the
diagram consists of two lines only—the liquidus and solidus. Above the
liquidus we have a uniform liquid solution for any alloy in the series, whilst
below the solidus we have a single solid solution for any alloy, though in
the cast condition, as we shall see, the solid solution may vary in concen-
tration due to coring. Between the liquidus and solidus both liquid and
solid solutions co-exist.

and F = 2
since there are two degrees of freedom both temperature and composition
can be altered over fairly wide limits without upsetting the stability of the
single phase. However, for a point between the liquidus and solidus, ie in
'liquid + solid' field:
2 + F=2+ 
1
and F = 1
There is thus one degree of freedom, and if either temperature or compo-
sition are altered independently of the other, then the system becomes
unstable so that some solid will melt or some liquid will solidify. Thus any
alteration in temperature must be accompanied by a change in overall
composition if the proportions of liquid and solid are to remain the same.
9.52 Consider the freezing of an alloy of composition A (Fig. 9.9), ie
containing 60% nickel and 40% copper. Assume that cooling is taking
place fairly rapidly, such as would be the case during the industrial casting
of slab ingots into cast-iron moulds. Above T0C the alloy will exist as a
uniform liquid solution, but as the temperature falls to T0C, dendrites of
solid solution will begin to form. They will not however be dendrites of
composition A but dendrites of composition B. This composition B is
indicated by drawing a tie-line from the liquidus at A (which represents
the composition and temperature of the original liquid) to the solidus,
Plate 9.2 70-30 cupro-nickel in the chill-cast condition, x 80.
This shows a mass of dendrites of heavily cored solid solution. The lighter cores are nickel-
rich whilst the copper-rich infilling has etched a darker colour.

which it cuts at B. Thus the dendrites which form will contain approxi-
mately 75% nickel (composition B) and, since the original liquid contained
only 60% nickel (composition A), it follows that the remaining liquid will
contain an even lower proportion of nickel. Hence its composition will
move to the left, say to A\.
Solidification will continue when the temperature falls further to T1, and
this time a layer of solid of composition B1 will be deposited. This is less
rich in nickel than the original seed crystals and, as crystallisation proceeds,
successive layers will contain less and less nickel, and consequently more
and more copper, until ultimately the liquid is used up.
Clearly, then, a non-uniform solid solution is formed, and whilst its
overall composition will be 60% nickel and 40% copper, due to the coring
effect the initial skeleton of a crystal will contain about 75% nickel and its
outside fringes only about 50% nickel.
9.53 The situation is further influenced, however, by diffusion (8.23),
which is taking place simultaneously with crystallisation. Due to the fact
that successive layers of the alloy which deposit are richer in nickel than
the remaining liquid, a concentration gradient is set up which tends to
make copper atoms diffuse inwards towards the centre of the dendrite,
whilst nickel atoms move outwards towards the copper-rich liquid. In the
above case we have assumed very rapid cooling so that little or no diffusion
has been possible, and that under these conditions the structure has been
unable to reach equilibrium so that a heavily cored structure forms. Since
we are dealing with non-equilibrium conditions, only a limited amount of
information can be obtained from the equilibrium diagram—in this case a
guide as to why the cored structure develops. If cooling were slow, dif-
fusion could take place extensively so that coring would be slight in the
final crystals. Annealing at a sufficiently high temperature will also permit
diffusion to proceed (8.24), resulting in the formation of almost completely
uniform solid-solution crystals.
9.54 We will now consider the cooling of the same alloy under con-
ditions which are ideally slow so that complete equilibrium is attained at
each stage of solidification. The liquid (composition A, Fig. 9.10) will begin
to solidify at temperature T by depositing nuclei of composition B. This
causes the composition of the remaining liquid to move to the left, but,
due to the prevailing slow cooling, diffusion is able to keep pace with

solidification so that, as the composition of the liquid follows the liquidus
from A to A2, the composition of the solid follows the solidus from B to
B2.
Thus, at some temperature Ti, the composition of the uniform solid
solution is given by B\, whilst that of the remaining homogeneous liquid
in equilibrium with it is given by A\. Since the overall composition of the
alloy is indicated by X (which is the same as A) then, by the Lever Rule:

At the temperature T2 the last trace of liquid (composition A2) has just
solidified at the crystal boundaries and, by the process of diffusion, its
composition has changed to that of the remainder of the structure which
has adjusted itself to uniform B2 throughout. A and B2 of course represent
the same composition, which is obvious, since a single uniform liquid sol-
ution has been replaced by a single uniform solid solution.
9.55 When two metals form a substitutional solid solution some distor-
tion of the lattice is inevitable due to influences such as different atom size.
In some cases the two metals are only just compatible and although they
are still soluble in all proportions in the solid state a phase diagram of the
type shown in Fig. 9.11 results. A minimum melting point (32.80C) is
produced where liquidus and solidus are congruent. The significance of this
minimum point is that the metals are so incompatible in solid solution that
there is a strong tendency for them to return to the disordered liquid state

at as low a temperature as possible. In fact a little more incompatibility
would lead to a complete 'divorce' to the extent that the metals would
separate forming a eutectic, probably of two solid solutions. We shall in
fact deal with this type of system in the next case.
Case IV—Two metals mutually soluble in all
proportions in the liquid state but only partially
soluble in the solid state
9.60 This case is in effect intermediate between the two dealt with in
Cases II and III and the thermal equilibrium diagram is, in consequence,
a sort of hybrid of these two. It represents a stage where incompatibility
has exceeded that suggested in Fig. 9.11. As in the cadmium-bismuth
system (where the metals are completely incompatible in the solid state)
a eutectic is formed, but in this case it is a eutectic of two solid solutions
instead of two pure metals. It is in fact the 'general' case and purists may
argue that, as such, it should have been dealt with before either of the
preceding particular cases. The systems have, however, been dealt with in
order of complexity rather than logical classification in order to assist the
student who may be encountering the subject for the first time.
The only new feature of this system, as compared with those foregoing,
is that we have phase boundaries occurring below the solidus, indicating
that phase changes can take place in the solid. On the tin-lead thermal-
equilibrium diagram (Fig. 9.12), which we shall use as an example of this
type of system, such phase boundaries as these are indicated by the lines
BC and FG. A line such as BC or FG is termed a solvus and indicates a
change in solubility of one metal in another in the solid state. Part of the
tin-lead system was used in Chapter 7 as an introduction to equilibrium
diagrams. We will now consider it in its entirety.
9.61 As the diagram shows, we have two solid solutions in the system,
since:
(a) Tin will dissolve up to a maximum of 2.6% lead at the eutectic
temperature, forming the solid solution a.
(b) Lead will dissolve up to a maximum of 19.5% tin at the eutectic
temperature, giving the solid solution (3.
(The different phases present in an alloy series are generally lettered from
left to right across the diagram, using letters of the Greek alphabet for
convenient reference.)
The slope of the phase boundaries BC and FG indicates that both the
solubility of lead in tin (a) and the solubility of tin in lead (|3) decrease as
the temperature falls. This is a normal phenomenon with solid solutions
as it is with liquid solutions. In Fig. 9.13 the solubility of a salt in water at
different temperatures is compared with the solid solubility of one metal
in another at different temperatures. In each case solubility increases as

temperature rises and saturated solutions are formed in a similar manner.
X and X\ each represent a mixture which at that temperature is an unsatu-
rated solution, ie it could dissolve more solute. As the temperature falls to
S (Si) the solution (liquid or solid) reaches a saturation point so that solid
salt (or metal B) begin to precipitate. At T (Ti) a considerable quantity Q
(Qi) of solute (either salt or metal B) is still in solution but as the tempera-
ture falls to R (Ri) this is reduced to a very small amount in each case—
Y (Yi) as salt (or metal B) is progressively precipitated from solution.
9.62 In the case of the tin-lead alloys the sloping boundaries BC and
FG indicate that changes take place in the solid. Thus as the temperature
falls:
(i) lead becomes less soluble in solid tin (a) along BC;
(H) tin becomes less soluble in solid lead (|3) along FG.
Several different structures may be formed, depending upon the alloy
composition. For example, let us consider:
(a) An alloy of composition X (70% lead-30% tin). This will begin to
solidify when the temperature falls to T and dendrites of composition Y
will deposit. The alloy continues to solidify in the manner of solid sol-
ution until at 183°C the last layer of solid to form will be composition F
(80.5% lead-19.5% tin) and the remaining liquid will be of composition
E (the eutectic composition with 38% lead and 62% tin).
The remaining liquid now solidifies by depositing, in the form of a
eutectic, alternate layers of a and |3, of the compositions B and F respect-
ively. If this structure now cools slowly to room temperature the compo-
sitions of the solid solutions a and |3 will follow the lines BC and FG, ie
the solid solution a will become progressively poorer in lead and the
solid solution (3 will become poorer in tin, until at, say, 1000C a will
contain less than 1% lead and (3 will contain less than 10% tin. The

proportions of a and (3 will also vary from EFIEB at 183°C to E'JIE'H
at 1000C. In the same way, provided we assume that the structure cooled
slowly enough to allow the primary dendrites of (3 to reach a uniform
composition F, these dendrites will now alter in composition to / at
1000C, and in so doing precipitate some a of composition H in order to
adjust their own composition. The a precipitated will join that already
present in the eutectic.
(b) If the alloy contained, say, 95% lead, and was cooled slowly
enough to prevent coring, solidification would be complete at P and a
uniform solid solution |3 would result. On continuing to cool slowly,
further solid changes would begin at Q with the precipitation of small
amounts of a at the grain boundaries of the (3. This a would increase in
amount as the temperature fell, and the |3 became progressively poorer
in tin. Hence the final structure would consist of crystals of uniform (3
containing about 98% lead with small amounts of a precipitated at the
crystal boundaries.
(c) If the original alloy contained more than 98% lead and was cooled
slowly, the structure would remain entirely (3 throughout, after its solidi-
fication had been completed at R.
9.63 In actual practice it is unlikely that cooling would be slow enough
to prevent some coring from taking place. Since the initial |3 dendrites
would then be relatively rich in lead, this could lead to the formation of
small amounts of a at the (3 grain boundaries in (c) and more than the
expected amount of a in (b). In case (c) this a would be absorbed on
annealing. 'Solution annealing' is an important process used in the treat-
ment of many alloys to absorb some constituent which has been precipi-
tated due to coring. After treatment the alloy will be soft and ductile and
able to receive cold-work. Solution annealing is also an integral part of
most strengthening processes based on precipitation hardening, the prin-
ciples of which will be discussed later (9.92).
Case V—A system in which a peritectic
transformation is involved
9.70 Sometimes in an alloy system two phases which are already present
interact at a fixed temperature to produce an entirely new phase. This is
known as a peritectic transformation. The term is derived from the Greek
'peri', which means 'around', since, during the transformation process, the
original solid phase becomes surrounded or coated by the transformation
product. Frequently one of the interacting phases is a liquid though this is
not a precondition and sometimes two solids will take part—albeit very
slowly—in a peritecto/d transformation. A peritectic transformation occurs
between the phase 6 and the remaining liquid (producing austenite) in
the iron-carbon system (11.20) but here we will consider the peritectic
transformation which takes place in the platinum-silver system, part of
which is shown in Fig. 9.14.

COMPOSITION (°/o)
Fig. 9.14 The platinum-silver thermal equilibrium diagram.
(i) A slowly cooled alloy containing about 75% silver will first begin to solidify as uniform a
(ii) Below 1185°C these a crystals will become coated with 6 due to peritectic interaction
with the remaining liquid, (iii) The original a will be transformed slowly to 6 as the temperature
falls, (iv) If cooling is extremely slow all a will be absorbed and the remaining liquid will
solidify as uniform 6. (v) In practice cooling will generally be so rapid as to 'trap' some a
'cores' in the final structure, producing a non-equilibrium structure.
9.71 If we ignore coring effects, that is, assume a very slow rate of
cooling, the peritectic transformation will occur only in those platinum-sil-
ver mixtures containing between 12 and 69% silver. Let us first consider a
liquid of composition x, ie containing about 25% silver. This will begin to
solidify by depositing dendrites of the solid solution a of composition a. If
the rate of cooling is slow enough for diffusion to remove the effects of
coring, by the time the temperature has fallen to 1185°C the structure will
consist of a dendrites containing 12% silver (composition P) and a remain-
ing liquid containing 69% silver (composition R), since the composition of
a will change as it follows the solidus SP. At this stage:

At 1185°C, the peritectic temperature, the a dendrites begin to
interact with the remaining liquid and form a new solid solution, 6, ie

silver) and it follows that not all of the a will be used up, since it is in
excess of that required to produce a structure entirely of 5. Therefore, all
of the liquid is used up and some a remains, so that the final structure will
consist of a containing 12% silver (composition P), and 5 containing 45%
silver (composition Q). These phases will be in a ratio given by:
Weight of a (composition P) 
X1Q
Weight of 3 (composition Q) 
X1P
9.73 Let us now consider a liquid alloy of initial composition y. This
will begin to solidify by depositing crystals of a of composition ai, and if
we again neglect coring, the crystals will gradually change in composition
to P when the temperature has fallen to 11850C, and again the composition
of the remaining liquid will be R. At this stage—
Weight of a (composition P) 
^1 R
Weight of remaining liquid (composition R) 
yxP
When the peritectic transformation takes place, we shall find that this time
there is an excess of liquid because yi lies between Q and R. The a will
therefore be completely used up, and just below 1185°C we shall be left
with the new solid solution, 8, and some remaining liquid in the ratio—
Weight of S (composition Q) 
yx R
Weight of remaining liquid (composition R) 
yx Q
As the temperature continues to fall slowly, this remaining liquid will
solidify as 5, which will change in composition along Qy2. At y2 solidifi-
cation will be complete and the structure will consist of crystals of uniform
5 of the same composition as that of the original liquid. In practice it is
unlikely that the rate of cooling would be slow enough to permit equilib-
rium being reached. Consequently, though the equilibrium structure is
indicated as being completely b (in the case of alloy y), remnants of the
original a dendrites may be present in the rapidly-cooled structure. The
original a dendrites, produced at temperatures above 1185°C, became
coated with a protective envelope of 8 as the interaction with the liquid
began and subsequent diffusion was far too slow to promote dispersal of
the remaining a.
Case Vl—Systems containing one or more
intermediate phase
9.80 Frequently two metals will not only form limited solid solutions with
each other but, in other suitable proportions, will also interact to form one
or more intermediate phases which may vary in nature from secondary
solid solutions to true intermetallic compounds. The formation of any

intermediate phase further complicates the thermal equilibrium diagram
by introducing extra boundary lines and since some alloy systems include
a number of intermediate phases, formed at different compositions of the
two metals, the resulting diagram becomes increasingly complex.
9.81 We will first examine the tin-magnesium system (Fig. 9.15) as an
example containing a single intermediate phase—in this case the intermet-
allic compound Mg2Sn (containing 29.1% magnesium). This system is rep-
resented by two simple equilibrium diagrams joined at B. The section AB
represents a eutectiferous series of the substances pure tin and Mg2Sn.
Here no solid solubility is involved and section AB can therefore be inter-
preted in the manner of Case II (the bismuth-cadmium system) dealt with
in 9.40. The section BC is a eutectiferous series of the Case IV type (9.60)
involving Mg2Sn and the solid solution a. If we consider the complete
system extending from pure tin to pure magnesium then, clearly, these two
sections become joined as shown, forming a single diagram. Since Mg2Sn
is an intermetallic compound of single fixed composition its 'phase field' is
represented on the diagram by a vertical line at 29.1% magnesium. A
particularly interesting feature of this diagram is that pure Mg2Sn has a
melting point (778°C) which is higher than those of either of the constituent
pure metals. This is an indication of the stability and strong chemical
bonding in this valence-type compound.
9.82 We will now consider the solidification of a representative alloy
in the series, ie alloy 'x' (60% tin-40% magnesium). This will begin to
solidify when the temperature falls to T and the tie-line from x cuts the
next phase boundary at y which represents the pure intermetallic com-

pound Mg2Sn. Therefore crystals of Mg2Sn begin to form. Since these
crystals are relatively tin-rich (70.9% tin) the composition of the remaining
liquid moves to the right to 'x{ and as the temperature falls to T\ more
Mg2Sn solidifies. Mg2Sn continues to solidify in this way until at 5600C the
remaining liquid contains 63.6% magnesium-36.4% tin—the composition,
E, of the Mg2Sn +a eutectic.
The remaining liquid then solidifies as eutectic at 5600C by depositing
alternate layers of Mg2Sn and the solid solution a, containing 85% mag-
nesium-15% tin (composition S). When completely solid the structure will
consist of primary crystals of the intermetallic compound Mg2Sn sur-
rounded by a eutectic of Mg2Sn and a. If the solid alloy is then allowed to
cool slowly below 5600C, a will change in composition along the solvus line
SL by depositing particles of Mg2Sn which will join the Mg2Sn constituent
already present in the eutectic.
9.83 The large size of lead atoms compared with those of many other
metals contributes to the fact that lead forms relatively few solid solutions.
Thus lead and gold are to all intents and purposes insoluble in each other
in the solid state but, due to differences in the electrochemical properties
of the metals two intermediate phases, Au2Pb and AuPb2 are formed at
the appropriate compositions. These two intermediate phases are produced
as a result of peritectic interactions and the resultant phase diagram is
shown in Fig. 9.16.

at about 5000C (T) by forming dendrites of gold, but on cooling to 418°C,
the first peritectic temperature, these gold dendrites undergo a peritectic
interaction with the remaining liquid to produce crystals of the intermedi-
ate phase, Au2Pb:
Au + liquid ^ AU2 Pb
These crystals of Au2Pb continue to grow as the temperature falls, but at
254°C a further peritectic interaction occurs resulting in the formation of
another intermediate phase AuPb2:
Au2Pb + liquid ^± AuPb2
During this second transformation all of the liquid is used up first and some
Au2Pb remains along with the new phase AuPb2. Assuming that the system
has cooled slowly to room temperature these two phases will be present
in the ratio:

Weight of AuPb2 ~~ ~AX

9.85 An alloy containing 70% lead will begin to solidify at about 2800C
(Ti) by depositing crystals of Au2Pb but at 254°C a peritectic interaction
results in the formation of AuPb2. Here all of the Au2Pb is used up and
the remaining liquid continues to solidify as the new phase AuPb2 until at
215°C the remaining liquid is of composition E (85% lead-15% gold). A
eutectic consisting of alternate layers of AuPb2 and pure lead is then
formed so that the final structure consists of primary AuPb2 in a eutectic
of AuPb2 and lead.
In both of these cases it has been assumed that cooling has been slow
enough to permit equilibrium to be attained throughout so that peritectic
transformations proceed to completion. In practice this may not be so.
Thus in the 40% lead alloy more than the indicated quantity of Au2Pb may
be present in the microstructure whilst in the 70% lead alloy some Au2Pb
cores may be present even though the diagram indicates a AuPb2-lead
structure.
9.86 Sometimes an intermediate phase is of variable composition. Thus
the phase (3 in the tantalum-nickel phase diagram (Fig. 9.17) is based on
TaNi3 but it may be thought of as being able to dissolve either excess
tantalum or excess nickel so that the phase field occupies width on the
diagram.

Precipitation from a Solid Solution
9.90 When the temperature of a solid solution falls such that it reaches
a state of saturation, any further fall in temperature will lead to the precipi-
tation of some second phase. This phenomenon was mentioned in 9.61 and
is similar in principle to the precipitation which takes place from saturated
liquid solutions when these continue to cool.
Precipitation from a solid solution, however, takes place much more
sluggishly than from a liquid solution because of the greater difficulty of
movement of the solute atoms in a solid solution, particularly if it is of the
substitutional type. We must, therefore, consider carefully the relationship
between the rate of cooling of a saturated solid solution and the extent
to which precipitation can take place—and consequently equilibrium be
attained—either during the cooling process or subsequently.
9.91 Precipitation under Equilibrium Conditions Fig. 9.18 rep-
resents part of a system such as was described in 9.60. Here metal B is
partially soluble in metal A in the solid state forming the solid solution a.
Any B in excess of solubility at any given temperature is precipitated,
under equilibrium conditions, as the phase (3, which in this case may be
either a solid solution or an intermediate phase*.
Consider the slow cooling of some alloy of composition X from the
temperature Tn. At Tu the solid solution a is unsaturated and this state of
affairs prevails until the temperature falls to Ts. Here the solid solution

reaches saturation and when the temperature falls below T8, precipitation
may begin. Random nucleation takes place at the grain boundaries as well
as on certain crystallographic planes in the a matrix, and nuclei of [3 begin
to form. As the alloy cools, precipitation of |3 continues, and since |3 is rich
in B, the composition of a changes progressively along the solvus line PQ.
Because (3 is richer in B than is a, B must diffuse through a in order to
reach the growing nuclei of (3. This tends to reduce the concentration of B
rather more rapidly in that a near to the (3 nuclei than in those regions of
a which are far away from any nuclei. The concentration gradient is,
however, too small to cause rapid diffusion of the B atoms, and, since the
temperature is falling, regions of a far from any (3 nuclei ultimately become
supersaturated with excess B. Consequently more (3 nuclei will form and
begin to grow.
Precipitates which form under equilibrium conditions in this manner are
generally non-coherent. That is, the new phase which has formed has a
crystal structure which is entirely its own and is completely separate from
the surrounding matrix from which it was precipitated. Its strengthening
effect on the alloy as a whole is somewhat limited (8.62) and generally
much less than that resulting from the presence of a coherent precipitate,
the formation of which will be dealt with in the next section.
Assuming that the temperature has fallen to TR and that the precipitation
of (3 has taken place under equilibrium conditions, the structure will consist
of non-coherent particles of (3 (usually of such a size as can be seen easily
using an ordinary optical microscope) in a matrix of a which is now of
composition Xi, ie it contains much less B than did the original a (compo-
sition X).

rejected from a as a non-coherent precipitate. The lattice parameters of (3 no longer 'match

9.92 Precipitation under Non-equilibrium Conditions We will now
assume that the alloy X, which has been retained at temperature Tu, long
enough for its structure to be completely homogeneous a, is cooled very
rapidly to room temperature (TR). This could be achieved by quenching it
in cold water. In most cases treatment such as this will prevent any precipi-
tation from taking place and we are left with a solid solution which, at TR,
is now super-saturated with B. The structure will not be in equilibrium and
is said to be in a metastable state. It has an urge to return to a state of
equilibrium by precipitating some |3. At room temperature such precipi-
tation will be unlikely to occur due to the extreme sluggishness of move-
ment of B atoms, but if the temperature is increased, diffusion will begin
and then accelerate as the temperature continues to rise.
The alloy is held at some selected temperature so that diffusion occurs
at a low but definite rate. The temperature chosen is well below Ts in
order to ensure that non-coherent precipitation does not occur. During this
heat-treatment clusters of atoms of both A and B, but with the overall
composition of the phase |3, slowly form groups at many points in the a
lattice. These clusters have the important property that their lattice structures
are continuous with that of the a matrix, and there is no discontinuous
interface as exists between a and |3, which has precipitated during cooling
under equilibrium conditions. This unbroken continuity of the two lattices
is known as coherency. Since the cluster size is extremely small and the
rate of diffusion very slow, a large number of these coherent nuclei will
form and the chosen temperature will not be high enough to allow the
formation of a separate (3 structure. Instead, this intermediate structure—
we will call it (3'—is produced, and the mismatching between (3' and the a
matrix leads to distortion in the a lattice in the neighbourhood of these
nuclei. Such distortions will hinder the movement of dislocations and so
the strength and hardness increase. The greater the number of nuclei and
the larger they are, provided that coherency is retained, the greater the
strength and hardness of the structure as a whole. Time and temperature
will influence this 'precipitation' procedure and, hence, also the ultimate
mechanical properties which result. If the temperature is high (Ti, Fig.
9.20) a high rate of diffusion prevails, and this in turn leads to the formation

of relatively few nuclei, which, however, will grow to a large size. At a
lower temperature (TY) a larger number of nuclei will form and grow slowly
so that strength increases slowly.
Alloys Containing More Than Two Metals
9.100 In this chapter we have dealt only with binary alloys, that is, alloys
containing two different metals. In the case of ternary alloys, namely, those
containing three different metals, a third variable is obviously introduced,
so that the system can no longer be represented by a two-dimensional
diagram. Instead we must work in three dimensions in order adequately to
represent the alloy system. The base of the three-dimensional diagram will
be an equilateral triangle, each pure metal being represented by an apex
of the triangle. Temperature will be represented by an ordinate perpen-
dicular to the triangular base. Fig. 9.21 illustrates a ternary-alloy system
of the metals A, B and C in which the binary systems A-B, B-C and A-C
are all of the simple eutectic type. The three binary liquidus lines now
become liquidus surfaces in the three-dimensional system, and these sur-
faces intersect in three 'valleys' which drain down to a point of minimum
temperature, vertically above EABC- This is the ternary eutectic point of
the system, its temperature being lower than that of any of the binary
eutectic points EAB, EBC or EAc
Equilibrium diagrams for alloys of four or more metals cannot be rep-
resented in a single diagram since more than three dimensions would be
required. In practice such a system can often usefully be represented in
the form of a pseudo-binary diagram in which the concentration of one
component is varied whilst the others are kept constant—this is equivalent
to taking a vertical 'slice' through a ternary system, parallel to one of the
end faces. One of these pseudo-binary systems is shown in Fig. 14.1. Such
systems can be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary binary system.

and C.

eutectic point, EABC-

We have dealt here only with equilibrium diagrams of the simple funda-
mental types. Many of those which the reader will encounter are far more
complicated and often contain such a multitude of different phases as
almost to exhaust the Greek alphabet. This is particularly true of equilib-
rium diagrams which represent those copper-base alloy systems in which
a number of intermetallic compounds are formed and in which peritectic
reactions are also common. In general, we are interested only in those
parts of the diagram near to one end of the system, where we usually find
a solid solution with, possibly, small amounts of an intermetallic com-
pound. The interpretation then becomes much simpler, and the reader has
been provided with sufficient information in this chapter to deal with most
of the alloy systems likely to be encountered.
Rapid Solidification Processes (RSP)
9.110 It was explained earlier (3.18) that the crystal size present in a
casting is dependent upon the rate at which the metal is cooling when it
reaches the solidification temperature. Large castings cool at a slow rate
of the order of l°C/s and will contain crystals of average grain diameter in
the region of 5 mm. However with very rapid cooling rates of approxi-
mately 104oC/s the crystal size will be no more than 10~3 mm, whilst if the
cooling rate is increased further to 106oC/s a completely amorphous struc-
ture can be retained with some alloys. That is, the structure is non-
crystalline and similar to that of glass.
9.111 The refinement—or elimination—of grain attendant upon RSP
may also produce the following structural changes:
1 The effects of minor segregation (3.41) are reduced since the same
amount of impurity is spread over a vastly increased area of grain boun-
dary so that its effect is 'diluted'. In amorphous structures segregation
will be virtually eliminated since grain boundaries are absent. In either
case greater homogeneity is achieved.
2 Rapid cooling can greatly extend the limits of solid solubility by introduc-
ing increased supersaturation. This can enhance precipitation hardening.
3 Some phases may be retained at ambient temperatures which could not
be obtained by orthodox quenching methods.
Reduction in crystal size and the consequent reduction in minor segre-
gation result in much higher strength, Young's modulus and in resistance
to corrosion (21.70); whilst magnetic properties can be improved in suitable
alloys. With some aluminium alloys the amounts of iron, manganese,
cobalt and nickel can be increased because more of these elements will be
retained in solid solution, due to rapid solidification, and so increase
strength. Improved properties of rapidly solidified superalloys of both
nickel and chromium as well as of titanium alloys are reported; whilst
amorphous alloys of iron, silicon and boron are very suitable for use in
transformer cores since they show an extremely low remanence (14.35)
and hysteresis loss.

9.112 The practical difficulties involved in attaining very high rates of
cooling limit rapid solidification products to either very fine powder or thin
foil. Nevertheless methods of achieving the high rates necessary to produce
extremely small crystals or, ultimately, an amorphous structure, are ingeni-
ous and varied.
Smooth spherical powders in a wide range of alloys can be made by
pouring the molten alloy through a small-diameter refractory nozzle.
Below the nozzle jets of a suitable inert gas impinge on the metal stream
'atomising' it and scattering it as small droplets. These are rapidly cooled
by the gas and collected as a fine powder at the base of the 'atomisation
tower'.
In spray-deposition processes a 'gas-atomised' stream of metal droplets
is directed on to a cooled metal surface. Fig. 9.22(i) indicates the basis of
a method by which strip may be formed; whilst in the Osprey process the
sprayed droplets build up on a cooled rotating former to produce discs,
rings or billets for subsequent hot working. Spray-deposition has been used
to produce high-speed steel forms up to 1.5 tonnes in mass.
Ribbon or foil can be manufactured direct from the melt by a variety of
'melt-spinning' processes the principles of which are indicated in Fig.
9.22(ii). Here molten metal is fed on to the surface of a continuously
cooled rotating wheel, to produce thin foil which subsequently parts from
the wheel as contraction occurs. Thin foil in iron-neodymium-boron
alloys is produced by this method and then consolidated for the manufac-
ture of permanent magnets.
Pulsed laser techniques giving cooling rates as high as 1012oC/s have been
developed recently and will increase the scope of this work.

Practical Metallography
10.10 Aloys Beck von Widmanstatten lived to the venerable age of nine-
ty-five, and when he died in 1849, had been, successively, owner of a
printing works; an editor in Graz; manager of a spinning mill near Vienna;
and, between 1806 and 1816, director of the State Technical Museum in
Vienna. In 1808 he discovered that some meteorites, when cut and pol-
ished, developed a characteristic structure when subsequently oxidised by
heating in air. Later, he found that etching with nitric acid gave better
results and revealed the type of metallurgical structure which still bears
his name. It may therefore be argued that von Widmanstatten originated
metallographic examination. The microscope, however, was not used in
this direction until 1841, when Paul Annosow used the instrument to exam-
ine the etched surfaces of Oriental steel blades.
In the early 1860s Professor Henry C. Sorby of Sheffield developed a
technique for the systematic examination of metals under the microscope
and can therefore lay claim to be the founder of that branch of metallurgy
known as microscopical metallography. Some of the photomicrographs he
produced are excellent even by modern standards.
It would not be possible in a book of this type to deal exhaustively with
the subject of the microscopical examination of metals. However, it is
hoped that what follows may help the reader to prepare representative
microstructures for himself, and so equip him to be able, as a practising
engineer, to trace many of the more common causes of failure which are
attributed to microstructural defects.
Much useful work can be done with a minimum of equipment. Whilst a
simple but good quality metallurgical microscope is an essential purchase,
much of the other apparatus required to prepare specimens for the micro-
scope can be home-made quite cheaply. Such simple 'tools' will enable
a trained eye to evaluate most of the common microstructural defects
encountered in commercial metals and alloys. Metallurgical knowledge of
this type can only be accumulated as a result of practice and experience.
Ability in this branch of metallurgical technique is, like beauty, in the eye
of the beholder.

The Preparation of Specimens for Microscopical
Examination
10.20 In preparing a specimen for microscopical examination it is first
necessary to produce in it a surface which appears perfectly flat and scratch-
free when viewed with the aid of a microscope. This involves first grinding
the surface flat, and then polishing it to remove the marks left by grinding.
The polishing process causes a very thin layer of amorphous metal to be
burnished over the surface of the specimen, thus hiding the crystal struc-
ture. In order to reveal its crystal structure the specimen is 'etched' in a
suitable reagent. This etching reagent dissolves the 'flowed' or amorphous
layer of metal.
That, briefly, is the basis of the process employed in preparing a speci-
men for examination; but first it will be necessary to select a representative
sample of the material under investigation.
10.21 Selecting the Specimen The selection of a specimen for micro-
scopical examination calls for a little thought, since a large body of metal
may not be homogeneous either in composition or crystal structure. Some-
times more than one specimen will be necessary in order adequately to
represent the material. In some alloys the structure may also exhibit 'direc-
tionality', as, for example, in wrought iron. In a specimen of the latter, cut
parallel to the direction of rolling, the slag will appear as fibres elongated in
the direction of rolling, whilst a section cut at right angles to the direction
of rolling will show the slag as apparent spherical inclusions, and give no
hint to the fact that what is being observed is a cross-section through slag
fibres.
For the examination of surface defects a specimen must be chosen so
that a section through the surface layer is included in the face to be pol-
ished. Surface cracks and the like should be investigated by cutting a piece
of metal containing the crack and mounting it in bakelite or a similar
compound. The surface to be polished is then ground sufficiently so that
a section through the crack is obtained.
A specimen approximately 20 mm diameter or 20 mm square is a con-
venient size to handle. It is difficult to grind a perfectly flat surface on
smaller specimens, and these are best mounted as described below. The
specimen should not be more than 12 mm thick, or it may rock during
polishing, producing a bevelled surface.
10.22 When it is necessary to preserve an edge, or when a specimen is
so small that it is difficult to hold it flat on the emery paper, the specimen
may be mounted in a suitable compound. This can be done most satisfac-
torily by using a proprietary plastics mounting material. These are gener-
ally either acrylic, polyester or epoxide resins. The kit supplied often
consists of a powder and two liquids. When these are mixed polymerisation
takes place and a hard plastics substance is produced which will retain
a metal specimen during and after the polishing operation. Only simple
apparatus of the type shown in Fig. 10.1 is required. The specimen is
placed on a suitable flat surface and the two L-shaped retaining pieces

arranged around it. (If possible, these retaining members should be held
in position with a small clamp.) The specimen is covered with the powder,
and this is then moistened with the first liquid. The whole is then saturated
with the liquid 'hardener'. In about twenty minutes the mass will have set
hard and the L-shaped members can be detached.
Specimens can be mounted more quickly by using some thermosetting
substance, such as bakelite or, alternatively, a transparent thermoplastics
material. These substances mould at about 1500C, which is usually too low
a temperature to cause any structural change in the specimen. They can
be ground and polished easily and do not promote any electrolytic action
during etching. A small mould (Fig. 10.2) is required in conjuction with a
press capable of giving pressures up to about 25 N/mm2. Indeed some of
the thermoplastics materials mould satisfactorily at such low pressures that
a sturdy bench vice can be used to apply the necessary force to this small
moulding unit.
After placing the specimen, the powder and the plunger in the mould
the latter is heated by means of a special electric heater which encircles it.
If this is not available a bunsen burner will suffice. In either case a ther-
mometer should be inserted in a hole provided in the plunger so that
overheating of the mould is avoided. Some mounting powders decompose
at high temperatures, with the formation of dangerously high pressures.
10.23 Grinding and Polishing the Specimen It is first necessary to
obtain a reasonably flat surface on the specimen. This can be done either
by using a fairly coarse file or, preferably, by using a motor-driven emery
belt. If a file is used it will be found easier to obtain a flat surface by
rubbing the specimen on the file than by filing the vice-held specimen in
the orthodox way. Skilled workshop technologists may wince at the thought
of such a procedure, but it is guaranteed to produce a flat surface for those
readers who, like the author, possess negligible skill in the use of a file.
Whatever method is used, care must be taken to avoid overheating the
specimen by rapid grinding methods, since this may lead to alterations in
the microstructure. When the original hack-saw marks have been ground
out, the specimen (and the operator's hands) should be thoroughly washed
in order to prevent carry-over of filings and dirt to the polishing papers.

Intermediate and fine grinding is then carried out on emery papers of
progressively finer grade. These must be of the very best quality, particu-
larly in respect of uniformity of particle size. With modern materials not
more than four grades are necessary (220, 320, 400 and 600 from coarse
to fine), since by using a paper with a waterproof base wet grinding can
be employed. Indeed dry grinding processes are now rarely used particu-
larly since it has been recognised that the dust of many heavy metals is
dangerously toxic. Rotary grinding 'decks' are available on to which discs
of grinding paper are clamped. These are driven by two-speed motors and
are fitted with water drip-feeds and suitable drains. Nevertheless equally
good results can be obtained (in a slightly longer time) by hand-grinding
the specimen on a home-made table of the type illustrated in Fig. 10.3.
Strips of water-proof emery paper, approximately 300 mm x 50 mm, are
obtainable for this purpose. The current of water which is flushed across
the surface not only acts as a lubricant but also carries away particles of
grit and swarf which might damage the surface being ground. The specimen
is drawn back and forth along the entire length of the No. 220 paper, so
that scratches produced are roughly at right angles to those produced by
the preliminary grinding operation. In this way it can easily be seen when
the original scratches produced by the primary grinding operation have
been completely removed. If the specimen were ground in the same direc-
tion so that the new scratches were parallel to the original ones this would
be virtually impossible. Having removed the primary grinding marks, the
specimen is washed free of No. 220 grit. Grinding is then continued on the
Fig. 10.3 A home-made grinding table for metallographic specimens.
The moveable water supply is transferred from one paper to the next as grinding proceeds
along the table. It would be easy to replace the wood blocks with a 'perspex' frame stuck
together with Araldite. The complete unit stands in an old photographic dish which is fitted
with a suitable drain and operated over a sink.

No. 320 paper, again turning the specimen through 90° and polishing until
the previous scratch marks have been removed. This process is repeated
with the No. 400 and No. 600 papers.* Light pressure should be used at
all stages otherwise particles of coarse grit, which may be trapped in the
surface of the paper, will cause deep score marks in the surface of the
specimen and these will take longer to remove and may necessitate
returning to a coarser paper.
In using rotary tables the same technique is used in that the specimen is
turned at right angles to the previous direction of grinding on passing from
one paper to the next. Here it is even more necessary to employ light
pressures since a torn paper will be the inevitable result of the edge of the
specimen digging into the surface when high-speed wheels are used.
So far the operation has been purely one of grinding, and if our efforts
have been successful we shall have finished with a specimen whose surface
is covered by a series of parallel grooves cut by the particles on the last
emery paper to be employed. The final polishing operation is somewhat
different in character and really removes the ridged surface layer by means
of a burnishing operation. When polishing is complete the ridges have
been completely removed, but the mechanism of polishing is such that it
leaves a 'flowed' or amorphous layer of metal on the surface (Fig 10.4).
This hides the crystal structure and must be dissolved by a suitable etching
reagent.

(A) Grooves produced in the metal surface by the final grinding operation. A deep
scratch produced by a particle of coarse grit is shown. (B) Final polishing has produced a
'flowed layer'. This may cover the deep scratch as shown, rendering it invisible. (C) Etching
has removed the flowed layer thus revealing the crystal structure beneath. Unfortunately the
deep scratch is also visible again.
Irons and steels are polished by means of a rotating cloth pad impreg-
nated with a suitable polishing medium. 'Selvyt' cloth was widely used to
cover the polishing disc but special hard-wearing cloths are now available
and are generally more suitable for this purpose. Numerous polishing
powders were popular in the past. These included alumina, magnesia,
chromium oxide and iron(III) oxide ('jeweller's rouge'), most of which
were messy in use. 'Gamma alumina' (aluminium oxide), prepared by
calcining pure ammonium alum, still has its devotees. Finer grades of this
material are supplied as a thick suspension in water. A little of this is
applied to the pad and worked into the surface with clean finger tips. A
constant drip of water is fed to the rotating pad which should be run at

low speeds until the operator has acquired the necessary manipulative
technique. Light pressures should be used, since heavy pressures are more
likely to result in scratches being formed by grit particles embedded deep
in the cloth. Moreover, the use of light pressure is less likely to result in
the specimen being suddenly projected across the laboratory.
Most metallographic specimens are now polished using one of the pro-
prietary diamond-dust polishing compounds. In these materials the graded
diamond particles are carried in a 'cream' base which is soluble in both
water and the special polishing fluid, a few spots of which are applied to the
polishing pad in order to lubricate the work and promote even spreading of
the compound. These compounds are graded and colour-coded according
to particle size (in micrometres). For polishing irons and steels it is gener-
ally convenient to use a two-stage technique necessitating two polishing
wheels. Preliminary polishing is carried out using a 6 |im particle size. The
specimen is then washed and finished on the second wheel using a 1 ^m
material. Since these compounds are expensive, it is desirable that the
operator should have some manipulative skill in order that frequent chang-
ing of the polishing pad is not made necessary due either to tearing of the
cloth or lack of cleanliness in working. At the same time the polishing
cloths have a much longer life than is the case with those polishing media
which tend to dry on the cloth and render it unfit for further use. The
oil-based lubricant used with diamond pastes keeps the cloth in good con-
dition so that it can be used intermittently over long periods, provided that
the pad is kept covered to exclude dust and grit. In this way the higher
cost of the diamond paste can be offset.
Non-ferrous specimens are best 'finished' by hand on a small piece of
'Selvyt' cloth wetted with 'Silvo'. Polishing should be accomplished with a
circular sweep of the hand, instead of the back-and-forth motion used in
grinding. As at every other stage, absolute cleanliness should be observed
if a reasonably scratch-free surface is to be obtained. Copper alloys can be
polished quickly by passing from the No. 400 grade of emery paper to a
piece of good-quality chamois leather wetted with 'Brasso'. The grinding
marks are very quickly removed in this way, and final polishing is then
accomplished with 'Silvo' and 'Selvyt' cloth. These polishing agents may
be found unsuitable in a few cases because of an etching action on the
alloy. It is then better to use magnesium oxide (magnesia).
When the specimen appears to be free from scratches it is thoroughly
cleaned and examined under the microscope using a magnification of about
50 or 100. If satisfactorily free from scratches the specimen can be exam-
ined for inclusions, such as manganese sulphide (in steel) or slag fibres (in
wrought iron), before being etched.
To summarise, the most important factors affecting a successful finish
are:
(a) Care should be taken not to overheat the specimen during grind-
ing. In steel this may have a tempering effect.
(b) Absolute cleanliness is essential at every stage.
(c) If a specimen has picked up deep scratches in the later stages of
grinding it is useless to attempt to remove them on the polishing pad. If

a specimen is polished for too long on the pad its surface may become
rippled.
(d) Apply light pressure at all times during grinding and polishing.
10.24 Etching the Specimen Before being etched the specimen must
be absolutely clean, otherwise it will undoubtedly stain during etching.
Nearly every case of failure in etching can be traced to inadequate cleaning
of the specimen so that a film of grease still remains.
The specimen should first be washed free of any adhering polishing
compound. The latter can be rubbed from the sides of the specimen with
the fingers, but care must be exercised in touching the polished face. The
best way to clean this is by very gently smearing the surface with a finger-tip
dipped in grit-free soap solution, and washing under the tap. Even now
the specimen may be slightly greasy, and the final film of grease is best
removed by immersing the specimen in boiling ethanol ('white' industrial
methylated spirit) for about two minutes. The ethanol should not be heated
over a naked flame, but preferably by an electrically heated water-bath.
Proprietary degreasing solutions are now obtainable. The fact that some
of these are perfumed brought forth the predictable ribald comments from
some of the author's students. However, it is suspected that the function
of the perfume is to mask the identity of the simple organic solvents used.
They seem to have no advantage over white methylated spirit or trichloro-
methane (carbon tetrachloride) as de-greasants.
From this point onwards the specimen must not be touched by the fingers
but handled with a pair of nickel crucible tongs. It is removed from the
ethanol and cooled in running water before being etched. With specimens
mounted in thermoplastic materials it may be found that the mount is
dissolved by hot ethanol. In such cases swabbing with a piece of cotton
wool soaked in caustic soda solution may be found effective for degreasing.
When thoroughly clean, the specimen is etched by being plunged into
the etching reagent and agitated vigorously for several seconds. The speci-
men is then quickly transferred to running water to wash away the etching
reagent, and then examined to see the extent to which etching has taken
place. Such inspection is carried out with the naked eye. If successfully
etched the surface will appear slightly dull, and in cast materials the indi-
vidual crystals may actually be seen without the aid of the microscope. If
the surface is still bright further etching will be necessary. The time
required for etching varies with different alloys and etching reagents. Some
alloys can be etched sufficiently in a few seconds, whilst some stainless
steels, being resistant to attack by most reagents, require as much as thirty
minutes.
After being etched the specimen is washed in running water and then
dried by immersion for a minute or so in boiling ethanol. If it is withdrawn
from the ethanol and shaken with a flick of the wrist to remove the surplus,
it will dry almost instantaneously. For mounted specimens, the mounts of
which are affected by boiling ethanol, it is better to spot a few drops of
ethanol on the surface of the specimen. The surplus is then shaken off and
the specimen held in a current of warm air from a hair drier. The specimen
must be dried evenly and quickly, or it will stain. If an efficient hair drier

is available the boiling ethanol bath can be dispensed with and the spotting
method used for all specimens.
A summary of the most useful etching reagents is given in Tables 10.1,
10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.
10.25 Both polishing and etching can be carried out electrolytically.
This involves setting up an electrolytic cell in which the surface of the
specimen acts as the anode. By choosing a suitable electrolyte and appro-
priate current conditions, the surface of the specimen can be selectively
dissolved to the required finish. Not only can 'difficult' metals and alloys
be attacked in this way, but a high-quality, scratch-free finish can be pro-
duced. The description of detailed techniques is, however, beyond the
scope of this book. The traditional methods of polishing and etching
already described are adequate for the successful preparation of most met-
allurgical materials.

The Metallurgical Microscope
10.30 The metallurgical microscope is similar in optical principles to any
other microscope, but differs from some of them in the method by which
the specimen is illuminated. Most biological specimens can be prepared
as thin, transparent slices mounted between sheets of thin glass, so that
illumination can be arranged simply, by having a source of light behind the
specimen. Metals, however, are opaque substances, and since they must
be illuminated by frontal lighting, it follows that the source of light must
be inside the microscope tube itself. This is usually accomplished, as in
Fig. 10.5, by means of a small plain-glass reflector, R, placed inside the
tube. With this system of illumination much of the light is lost both by
transmission when it first strikes the plate and, by reflection, when the
returning ray from the specimen strikes the inclined plate again. Neverthe-
less, a small 6-volt bulb is usually sufficient as a source of illumination.
The width of the beam is controlled by the iris diaphragm, D. Generally
speaking, this should be partly closed so that the beam of light is just
sufficient to cover the back component of the objective lens. An excess of
light, reflected from the sides of the microscope tube, will cause light-
scatter and, consequently, 'glare' in the field of view.
The optical system of the microscope consists of two lenses, the objec-
tive, O, and the eyepiece, E. The former is the more important and expen-
sive of the two lenses, since it has to resolve the fine detail of the object
being examined. Good-quality objectives are corrected for chromatic and

Fig. 10.5 
The basic optical system of the metallurgical microscope.
This illustrates the system used in an early instrument. However, the optical system is
fundamentally similar in more sophisticated modern instruments.
spherical aberrations, and hence, like camera lenses, are of compound
construction. The magnification given by the objective depends upon its
focal length—the shorter the focal length, the higher the magnification. In
addition to magnification, resolving power is also important. This is defined
as the ability of a lens to show clearly separated two lines which are very
close together. In this way resolution can be expressed as a number of
lines per mm. Thus resolving power depends upon the quality of the lens,
and it is useless to increase the size of the image, either by extending the
tube length of the microscope or by using a higher-power eyepiece, beyond
a point where there is a falling off of resolution. A parallel example in
photography is where a small 90 mm x 60 mm snapshot, on enlarging,
fails to show any more detail than it did in its original size and in fact shows
blurred outlines as a result.

Plate 10.2 An 'Olympus' metallurgical microscope equipped for binocular vision.
Four objectives of different focal lengths are carried on a rotatable turret. Illumination is by
either tungsten or quartz halogen light source. (Courtesy of Metallurgical Services Labora-
tories Ltd, Betchworth, Surrey).
However, there is a definite limit to the extent to which it is worthwhile
developing microscope objectives since at high magnifications we are deal-
ing with dimensions of the same order as the wavelength of light itself so
that definition then begins to suffer considerably. Consequently micro-
scope lenses are cheap compared with high-quality camera lenses where
the main restriction is the 'resolving power' of the photographic emulsion
which accepts the image formed by the lens.
The eyepiece is so called because it is the lens nearest the eye. It is a
relatively simple lens and its purpose is to magnify the image produced by
the objective. Eyepieces are made in a number of 'powers', usually x 6,
x 8, x 10 and x 15.
The overall approximate magnification of the complete microscope
system can be calculated from:
T.N
Magnification = -—
where T = the tube length of the microscope measured from the back
component of the objective to the lower end of the eyepiece;
F = the focal length of the objective; and
N = the power of the eyepiece.
Thus for a microscope having a tube length of 200 mm and using a 16-mm
focal-length objective and a x 10 eyepiece, the magnification would be

—TT 
, ie 125. Most metallurgical microscopes have a standard tube
length of 200 mm. Assuming a tube length of this value, approximate
magnifications with various objectives of standard focal lengths will be
found in Table 10.5.

Most modern microscope objectives are engraved with a 'multiplying
power' which is relative to the tube length of the microscope for which
they are designed. The overall magnification is then obtained simply by
multiplying the 'power' of the objective by that of the eyepiece, eg a x 40
objective used in conjunction with a x 10 eyepiece will give an overall
magnification of x 400.
Many sophisticated modern microscopes contain built-in refinements ful-
filling various purposes. Thus the facility of using polarised light often
helps in the identification of a phase. For example, particles of cuprous
oxide in copper (16.22) which, with normal illumination, appear as sky-
blue globules can be made to glow like rubies with the use of the polariser.
Microscopes equipped for dark-field illumination are very useful in the
photography of many low-contrast subjects.
10.31 Using the Microscope Most readers will be familiar with the
fact that in ordinary camera photography the depth of field reasonably in
focus at the focal plane depends upon the distance of the object from the
camera lens. Thus with a landscape view everything will be fairly sharply
in focus between about ten metres and infinity. However, if the subject is
only one metre from the lens then, assuming it is sharply in focus itself, a
zone of only a few centimetres either side of one metre will be reasonably
in focus. A microscope lens works at a distance of only a few millimetres
from the object and it follows therefore that the 'depth of field' is neglig-
ible. Consequently, as mentioned earlier (10.20) it is essential to provide
the specimen with an absolutely flat surface and to mount the specimen so
that its surface is normal to the axis of the instrument. This is most easily
achieved by fixing the specimen to a microscope slide by means of a piece
of plasticine. Normality is assured by using a mounting ring, as shown in
Fig. 10.6. Obviously, the mounting ring must have perfectly parallel end
faces. Mounting may not be necessary for specimens which have been set
in bakelite, since the top and bottom faces of the bakelite mount are
usually parallel, so that it can be placed directly on to the table of the
microscope.
The specimen is brought into focus by using first the coarse adjustment
and then the fine adjustment. It should be noted that the lenses supplied
are generally designed to work at a fixed tube length (usually 200 mm),
under which conditions they give optimum results. Therefore, the tube
carrying the eyepiece should be drawn out the appropriate amount (a scale
is usually engraved on the side of the tube). Slight adjustments in tube
length may then be made to suit the individual eye.

Finally, the iris in the illumination system should be closed to a point
where illumination just begins to decrease. This will limit glare due to
internal reflections in the tube.
It is a mistake to assume that high magnifications in the region of 500
or 1000 are always the most useful. In fact, they will often give a completely
meaningless impression of the structure, since the field under observation
will be so small. Directional properties in wrought structures or dendritic
formation in cast structures are best seen using low powers of X 40 to x
100. Even at x 40 a single crystal of, say, cast 70-30 brass may completely
fill the field of view. The dendritic pattern, however, will be clearly appar-
ent, whereas at x 500 only a small area between two dendrite arms would
fill the field of view. As a matter of routine, a low-power objective should
always be used first to gain a general impression of the structure before it
is examined at a high magnification.
10.32 The Care of the Microscope 
Care should be taken never to
touch the surface of optical glass with the fingers, since even the most
careful cleaning may damage the surface, particularly if it has been
'bloomed' (coated with magnesium fluoride to increase light transmission).
In normal use dust may settle on a lens, and this is best removed by
sweeping gently with a high-quality camel-hair brush.
If a lens becomes accidentally finger-marked, this is best dealt with by
wiping gently with a good-quality lens-cleaning tissue (such as Green's
No. 105) moistened with xylol. Note that the operative word is wipe and
not rub. Excess xylol must be avoided, as it may penetrate into the mount
of the lens and soften the cement holding the components together.
High-power objectives of the oil-immersion type should always be wiped
clean of cedar-wood oil before the latter has a chance to harden. If harden-
ing takes place due to the lens being left standing for some time, then the
oil will need to be removed by xylol, but the use of the latter should be
avoided when possible.
If special lens tissues are not available soft, well-washed linen may be
used to clean lenses. It is far superior to chamois leather, which is likely
to retain particles of grit, and to silk which has a tendency to scratch the
surface of soft optical glass.
10.33 The Electron Microscope 
Whilst much of the routine micro-
examination of metals is carried out at low magnifications in the region of
x 100, it is often necessary in metallurgical research to be able to examine
structures at very high magnifications. Unfortunately the highest magnifi-
cation possible with an ordinary optical microscope is in the region of
x 2000. Above this magnification the dimensions being dealt with are
comparable with the wavelength of light itself. Indeed, since blue light is
of shorter wavelength than red light, it is advantageous to view specimens
by blue light when examining very fine detail at high magnifications.
For very high-power microscopy (between X 2000 and several millions)
light rays can be replaced by a beam of electrons. The bending or refracting
of light rays in an optical microscope is achieved by using a suitable glass-
lens system. A similar effect is produced in the electron microscope by
using an electro-magnetic 'lens' to refract the electron beam. This 'lens'

consists of coil systems which produce the necessary electro-magnetic field
to focus the electron beam.
Whereas light rays are reflected to a very high degree from the surface
of a metal, electrons are transmitted. They are able to pass through a thin
metallic foil, but will be absorbed by greater thicknesses of metal. We must
therefore view the specimen by transmission instead of by reflection, and
in order to examine the actual surface of a metal the replica method is
generally used. This involves first preparing the surface of the specimen
and then coating it with some suitable plastic material, a very thin film of
which will follow the contours of the metallic surface. The thin plastic
mould, or replica of the surface, is thefi-separated from the specimen and
photographed by transmitted electrons using the electron microscope.
Following the development of the orthodox electron microscope out-
lined very briefly above, other instruments of allied design have become
available. Thus, the high-voltage electron microscope permits the use of
thicker replica specimens and at the same time offers greater magnifica-
tions. The scanning electron microscope differs in principle from the ortho-
dox instrument in that electrons generated and reflected from the actual
surface of the specimen are used to produce the image. The image is built
up by scanning the surface in a manner similar to that employed in a
synchronously-scanned cathode ray tube. An image of very high resolution
is produced but an even more important feature is the great depth of field
available as compared with an optical instrument. This enables unprepared
surfaces, eg fractures, to be scanned at magnifications up to 50 000.
In a somewhat different category is the field-ion microscope in which the
image is formed by gas ions rather than by electrons. With this instrument
magnifications can be measured in millions enabling details on the atomic
scale such as dislocations, vacancies, grain boundary defects and very small
precipitates to be examined. Single atoms, particularly the larger ones,
come just within the range of this instrument.
A recent development is the scanning acoustic microscope (S AM) which
enables the materials scientist to examine both surface and subsurface
structures. The essential feature of this rather complex instrument is a ruby
'lens' which focuses high-frequency vibrations (of up to 1.5 GHz) on to
the region being examined. The reflected vibrations, following the same
path as the incident waves, are received by a transducer and converted
into electrical signals. By scanning in raster pattern an image can be built
up which is displayed on a TV monitor'. The main feature of SAM is that
it can examine both surfaces and subsurfaces non-destructively and with a
minimum of specimen preparation.
Macro-Examination
10.40 Useful information about the structure of a piece of metal can often
be obtained without the aid of a microscope. Such investigation is usually
referred to as 'macro-examination' and may be carried out with the naked
eye or by using a small hand magnifying lens.

Plate 10.4 10.4A A vertical section through a small ingot of aluminium.
Normal size. Etched by swabbing with a 20% solution of hydrofluoric acid.

Deep-etched in boiling 50% hydrochloric acid for 30 minutes to reveal the flow lines. The
strength of the teeth is increased by the continuous 'fibre' produced by forging, x V2. (Courtesy
of Forgings and Presswork Ltd, Birmingham).
The method of manufacture of a component can often be revealed by
an examination of this type (Plate 10.4B and Fig. 6.5), whilst defects, such
as the segregation of antimony-tin cuboids in a bearing metal (Plate 18.1),
can also be effectively demonstrated. Macro-examination is also a means
of assessing crystal size, particularly in cast structures (Plate 10.4B), whilst
various forms of heterogeneity, such as is shown in the distribution of
sulphide globules in cast steel, can be similarly examined.
Usually, medium grinding is sufficient to produce a satisfactory surface
for examination, and for large components an emery belt will be found
almost indispensable. Polishing is not necessary, and for most specimens
grinding can be finished at Grade 320 paper. Bearing in mind the rougher
nature of the work, it will be realised that grinding should not be carried
out on papers which are used for the preparation of specimens for examin-
ation under the microscope. Discarded papers from micro-polishing pro-
cesses can be used for the preparation of macro-sections.
After being ground, the specimen should be washed to remove grit, but
it will not generally be necessary to degrease it in view of the fact that
macroscopic etching is often prolonged and removes more than the flowed
layer. The fibrous structure of a forged-steel component, for example, is
revealed by deep-etching the component in boiling 50% hydrochloric acid

for up to fifteen minutes. After being etched, the specimen is washed and
dried in the usual way, though fine detail is often more clearly seen when
the component is wet. Suitable etchants for the macroscopic examination
of various alloys are shown in Table 10.6.
If a macro-section such as that shown in Plate 10.4B is etched very deeply
by immersion in boiling 50% hydrochloric acid for thirty minutes or more,
a tolerable 'ink print' can be taken from its surface. To do this a blob of
printer's ink is squeeged thoroughly on to a flat piece of plate glass using
a photographic roller-type squeegee. The object is to obtain a very thin
but uniform film of ink on the roller. This is then carefully rolled over the
deep-etched surface using very light pressure so that only the raised ridges
receive ink. The inked surface is then gently pressed on to a sheet of
white smooth paper when an ink print should be obtained. Better contact
between paper and inked section is achieved if the paper (which must be
on an absolutely flat surface) is backed by a couple of thicknesses of blot-
ting paper.

Sulphur Printing
10.50 This affords a useful means of determining the distribution of sul-
phides in steel. The specimen should first be ground to Grade 320 emery
paper and then thoroughly degreased and washed. Meanwhile a sheet of
single-weight matt photographic bromide paper is soaked in a 2% solution
of sulphuric acid for about five minutes. It is then removed from the
solution and any surplus drops are wiped from the surface.
The emulsion side of the paper is then placed on the surface of the
specimen and gently rolled with a squeegee to expel any air bubbles and
surplus acid from between the surfaces. Care must be taken that the paper
does not slide over the surface of the specimen, for which reason matt
paper is preferable. For small specimens the paper can be laid emulsion
side upwards on a flat surface and the specimen then pressed firmly into
contact with it; care again being taken to prevent slipping between the
paper and the specimen.
After about five minutes* paper and specimen can be separated, and it
will be found that the paper has been stained brown where it was in contact
with particles of sulphide. The sulphuric acid reacts with the sulphides to
produce the gas hydrogen sulphide, H2S:
MnS + H2SO4 = MnSO4 + H2S
FeS + H2SO4 = FeSO4 + H2S
The liberated hydrogen sulphide then reacts with the silver bromide,
AgBr, in the photographic emulsion to form a dark-brown deposit of silver
sulphide, Ag2S:
2AgBr + H2S = 2HBr + Ag2S
The print is rinsed in water and 'fixed' for ten minutes in a solution
containing 100 g of 'hypo' (sodium thiosulphate) in 1 litre of water. The
function of this treatment is to dissolve any surplus silver bromide, which
would otherwise darken on exposure to light. Finally, the print is washed
for thirty minutes in running water, and dried.

The Heat-Treatment of
Plain Carbon Steels—(I)
11.10 Most modern schoolboys appear to be aware of the fact that a piece
of carbon steel can be hardened by plunging it into cold water from a
condition of bright red heat. Unfortunately many of them assume that
similar treatment will harden any metallic material. Which illustrates the
danger of feeding unrelated and unexplained facts to schoolboys! Be that
as it may there are numerous examples where metallurgical technology has
predated its scientific understanding. Steel has been hardened by quench-
ing for many centuries, yet it was only during the present century that a
reasonable scientific explanation of the phenomenon was forthcoming.
In the first part of this chapter we shall consider the development of
equilibrium structures in steels in greater detail than was possible in Chap-
ter 7. We shall follow this with a study of those heat-treatment processes
which depend upon equilibrium being reached in the structure of the steel
under treatment.
11.11 What is generally called the 'iron-carbon thermal equilibrium
diagram' is illustrated in Fig. 11.1. Strictly speaking it should be named
the 'iron-iron carbide metastable system' since, theoretically at least, iron
carbide is not a completely stable phase. Nevertheless iron carbide precipi-
tates from austenite, during ordinary conditions of cooling, in preference to
the theoretically more stable graphite. Once formed iron carbide—or
cementite—is quite stable and for our purposes it will be satisfactory to
regard it as an equilibrium phase.
The iron-carbon diagram is of the type dealt with in 9.60, that is, where
two substances are completely soluble in each other in the liquid state but
are only partially soluble in the solid state. The diagram is modified in
shape as a result of the polymorphic changes occurring in iron at 9100C
and 14000C. However, despite the apparent complexity of the diagram, we
have only three important phases to consider, namely:
11

CARBON (%>)
Fig. 11.1 The iron-carbon thermal equilibrium diagram.
(i) austenite (y), the solid solution formed when carbon dissolves in
face-centred cubic iron in amounts up to 2.0%;
(ii) ferrite (a), a very dilute solid solution of carbon in body-centred
cubic iron and containing at the most only 0.02% carbon;
(iii) cementite, or iron carbide, Fe3C, an interstitial compound (8.31)
of iron and carbon containing 6.69% carbon.
For the sake of clarity the important areas of the iron-carbon diagram
are shown in greater detail in Figs. 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4.
The reader may well have seen different values ascribed to the salient
points of the iron-carbon diagram, depending upon the age of the publi-
cation, its author and even the country of origin. In fact during the pro-
fessional lifetime of the present author the carbon content of austenite at
the eutectoid point has been accepted as 0.89; 0.85; 0.83; 0.80 and 0.77%
—and not necessarily in that order! At the same time the eutectoid, or
lower critical, temperature has been quoted between 698 and 732°C; whilst
the maximum solubility of carbon in austenite (at 1131°C) has been given
different values between 1.7 and 2.08%. This lack of precision leading to
a variation of no less than 15% in the value ascribed to the carbon content
of the eutectoid composition, is due to the large number of variable influ-
ences prevailing during the experimental determination of these salient
points combined with the rather imprecise methods which are available,
mainly microexamination, to make such determinations.
Having redrawn the iron-carbon diagrams at each new edition of this
book a number of times in the past, this author has decided to settle on

contents of austenite respectively. However the student should perhaps be
warned—take note of the particular values used by your lecturer or you
may lose marks in examinations.
11.20 Let us now consider the type of structure likely to be produced
in a large steel sand-casting, containing 0.3% carbon, as it solidifies and
cools slowly to room temperature. Such an alloy will begin to solidify at
temperature T (Fig. 11.2) by forming dendrites of the solid solution 5 of
composition X. These dendrites will develop and change in composition
along XC due to diffusion promoted by the slow rate of cooling, until at
1493°C they will be of composition C (0.1% carbon). The remaining liquid
will have become correspondingly enriched in carbon and will be of compo-
sition B (0.51% carbon).

Application of the Lever Rule (above) indicates that at this stage there
will be approximately equal amounts of 5 and liquid. At 1493°C a peritectic
interaction takes place between the remaining liquid and the dendrites of

Thus there is now one-and-a-half times as much austenite as there is
remaining liquid, and, as the temperature falls, the remaining liquid solidi-
fies as austenite which will change in composition along PY. Solidification
will be complete at Y and the austenite crystals will be of uniform compo-
sition containing 0.3% carbon. Since carbon is dissolved interstitially it can
diffuse rapidly through the face-centred cubic structure of the austenite
and because our large steel sand-casting will be cooling slowly there will
be virtually no coring remaining in the structure.
11.21 Apart from considerable grain growth of the austenite no further
change will take place in the microstructure until the line FE (Fig. 11.3)
is reached at F. The temperature represented by F is called the upper
critical (or A3) temperature of this 0.3% carbon steel. Thus the upper
critical temperature of a steel varies with its carbon content and will be

represented by the appropriate point on FEG. As the temperature of our
0.3% carbon steel falls below Ff the face-centred cubic austenite becomes
unstable and the polymorphic transformation (3.14) to body-centred cubic
ferrite (a) begins. Thus, crystals of ferrite nucleate within the austenite
crystals and grow progressively by absorbing the austenite structure. Since
the ferrite which forms first contains very little carbon (K) it follows that
the shrinking crystals of austenite will become increasingly rich in carbon.
Since transformation from austenite to ferrite is accompanied by diffusion
the composition of the ferrite will change slightly along KH whilst the
austenite will change in composition along FE. At 723°C (L) the ferrite
will contain 0.02% carbon and the remaining austenite 0.8% carbon, and:

= 1.79/1
Thus there is almost twice as much ferrite present as there is austenite.
11.22 At 723°C the remaining austenite transforms to the eutectoid
pearlite by forming alternate layers of ferrite and cementite as previously
described (7.55 and 8.43). The temperature, 723°C, at which pearlite is
formed is called the lower critical (or Ai) temperature, and is the same for
carbon steels of all compositions since the eutectoid temperature is con-
stant, ie HEJ is horizontal. Since the whole of the austenite remaining at
723°C has transformed to pearlite it follows that the proportions ferrite/
pearlite will be 1.79/1 as calculated above. That is, the microstructure
would show roughly twice as much ferrite as pearlite.
11.23 A 0.8% carbon steel will begin to solidify at approximately
14700C by depositing dendrites of austenite of composition R (Fig. 11.1)
and, when solidification is complete, the structure will consist of crystals
of austenite of overall composition 0.8% carbon. As the steel cools slowly,
the structure becomes uniform by rapid diffusion and no further structural
change will take place until the point E (Fig. 11.3) is reached. For a steel
of this composition the upper and lower critical temperatures coincide and
the austenitic structure transforms at this temperature to one which is
totally pearlitic.
11.24 A 1.2% carbon steel will solidify in a similar way to the 0.8%
carbon steel by forming austenite crystals of an overall carbon content of
1.2%. As the temperature falls to the upper critical for this alloy at G'
(Fig. 11.3) needles of primary cementite begin to precipitate at the crystal
boundaries of the austenite (at least the cementite appears to be needle-like
in form in a two-dimensional microscope view but in fact we will be seeing
cross-sections through flat cementite plates). Since cementite is being
deposited the remaining austenite will be rendered less rich in carbon, so

that its composition will move to the left and when the temperature has
fallen to 723°C the remaining austenite will contain 0.8% carbon. As
before, pearlite will now form, giving a final structure of primary cementite
in a matrix of pearlite.
11.25 Thus, in a steel which has been permitted to cool slowly enough
to enable it to reach structural equilibrium, we shall find one of the follow-
ing structures:
(a) With less than 0.006% carbon it will be entirely ferritic. In practice,
such an alloy would be classed as commercially pure iron.
(b) With between 0.006% and 0.8% carbon the structure will contain
ferrite and pearlite. The relative proportions of ferrite and pearlite
appearing in the microstructure will vary according to the carbon con-
tent, as shown in Fig. 7.7.
(c) With exactly 0.8% carbon the structure will be entirely pearlitic.
(d) With between 0.8% and 2.0% carbon the structure will consist of
cementite and pearlite, in relative amounts which depend upon the
carbon content.

11.26 The composition of the pearlite area in the microstructure of any
plain carbon steel is always the same, namely 0.8% carbon, and if the
overall carbon content is either greater or smaller than this, then it will be
compensated for by variation in the amount of either primary ferrite or
primary cementite. The hardness of a slowly cooled steel increases directly
as the carbon content, whilst the tensile strength reaches a maximum at
the eutectoid composition (Fig. 7.7). These properties can be modified by
heat-treatment, as we shall see in this chapter and the next.
Impurities in Steel
11.30 Most ordinary steels contain appreciable amounts of manganese,
residual from the deoxidation process (3.21). Impurities such as silicon,
sulphur and phosphorus (7.21) are also liable to be present in the finished
steel. The effect of such impurities on mechanical properties will depend
largely upon the way in which these impurities are distributed throughout
the structure of the steel. If a troublesome impurity is heavily cored in the
structure it can be expected to have a far more deleterious effect than if the
same quantity of impurity were evenly distributed throughout the structure.
Excessive coring concentrates the impurity in the grain-boundary regions
often producing the effect of very brittle inter granular films. The extent to
which coring of a particular element is likely to occur will be indicated by
the distance apart of the solidus and liquidus lines at any temperature
on the appropriate equilibrium diagram. Thus in Fig. 11.5A the relative
compositions of solid (S) and liquid (L) are very far apart at any tempera-
ture and this may lead to excessive coring. Since relatively pure metal
is solidifying it follows that the bulk of the impurity element becomes
concentrated in the metal which solidifies last—in the grain boundary
regions. In Fig. 11.5B, however, the compositions of the solid (S) and the
liquid (L) remain close to each other throughout solidification and this will
lead to a relatively even distribution of the impurity element throughout
the microstructure and a consequent lack of dangerous crystal-boundary
concentrations of brittle impurity.

The crystals in solid steel are never extensively cored with respect to
silicon and manganese, and since these elements have a high solid solubility
in steel they are unlikely ever to appear as separate constituents in the
microstructure. In solid solution in amounts up to 0.3% therefore their
direct effect is minimal. Sulphur and phosphorus, on the other hand, segre-
gate appreciably and if present in sufficient amounts could precipitate dur-
ing solidification, as their respective iron compounds, at the austenite grain
boundaries. The effect would be aggravated by the relatively low solu-
bilities of these elements in steel.
11.31 Manganese is not only soluble in austenite and ferrite but also
forms a stable carbide, Mn3C. In the nomenclature of the heat-treatment
shop, manganese increases the depth of hardening' of a steel, for reasons
which will be discussed in Chapter 13. It also improves strength and
toughness. Manganese should not exceed 0.3% in high-carbon steels
because of a tendency to induce quench cracks particularly during water-
quenching.
11.32 Silicon imparts fluidity to steels intended for the manufacture
of castings, and is present in such steels in amounts up to 0.3%. In high-
carbon steels silicon must be kept low, because of its tendency to render
cementite unstable (as it does in cast iron (15.22)) and liable to decompose
into graphite (which precipitates) and ferrite.
11.33 Phosphorus is soluble in solid steel to the extent of almost 1%.
In excess of this amount the brittle phosphide Fe3P is precipitated. In
solution phosphorus has a considerable hardening effect on steel but it
must be rigidly controlled to amounts in the region of 0.05% or less because
of the brittleness it imparts, particularly if Fe3P should appear as a separate
constituent in the microstructure.
In rolled or forged steel the presence of phosphorus is indicated by
what are usually termed 'ghost bands' (Fig. 11.6c). These are areas (which

naturally become elongated during rolling) containing no pearlite, but
instead, a high concentration of phosphorus. The presence of phosphorus
and absence of pearlite will naturally make these ghost bands planes of
weakness, particularly since, being areas of segregation, other impurities
may be present in the ghosts.
11.34 Sulphur is the most deleterious impurity commonly present in
steel. If precautions were not taken to render it harmless it would tend to
form the brittle sulphide, FeS. Sulphur is completely soluble in molten
steel but on solidification the solubility falls to 0.03% sulphur. If the effects
of extensive coring, referred to above, are also taken into account it will
be clear that amounts as low as 0.01% sulphur may cause precipitation of
the sulphide at the crystal boundaries. In this way the austenite crystals
would become virtually coated with brittle films of iron(II) sulphide. Since
this sulphide has a fairly low melting point, the steel would tend to crumble
during hot-working. Being brittle at ordinary temperatures, iron(II) sul-
phide would also render steel unsuitable for cold-working processes, or,
indeed, for subsequent service of any type.
It would be very difficult, and certainly very expensive, to reduce the
sulphur content to an amount less than 0.05% in the majority of steels. To
nullify the effects of the sulphur present an excess of manganese is there-
fore added during deoxidation. Provided that about five times the theoreti-
cal manganese requirement is added, the sulphur then forms manganese
sulphide, MnS, in preference to iron(II) sulphide. The manganese sulphide
so formed is insoluble in the molten steel, and some is lost in the slag. The
remainder is present as fairly large globules, distributed throughout the
steel, but since they are insoluble, they will not be associated with the
structure when solidification takes place. Moreover, manganese sulphide
is plastic at the forging temperature, so that the tendency of the steel to
crumble is removed. The manganese sulphide globules become elongated
into threads by the subsequent rolling operations (Fig. 11.6A and B).
11.35 Nitrogen Atmospheric nitrogen is absorbed by molten steel dur-
ing the manufacturing process. Whether this nitrogen combines with iron
to form nitrides or remains dissolved interstitially after solidification (Fig.
11.7), it causes serious embrittlement and renders the steel unsuitable
for severe cold-work. For this reason mild steel used for deep-drawing
operations must have a low nitrogen content.
Due to the method of manufacture, Thomas steel was particularly sus-
pect and had nitrogen contents as high as 0.02% probably leading to the
presence of brittle Fe4N in the structure (Fig. 11.7). This was more than
four times the average nitrogen content of open-hearth steel adequate for
deep-drawing operations. Naturally the modern 'oxygen' processes (7.36)
can produce mild steel with a very low nitrogen content (below 0.002%),
since little or no nitrogen is present in the blast to the molten charge. Such
steel is obviously ideal for deep-drawing. It is difficult, however, to prevent
some atmospheric nitrogen from being absorbed, since the molten steel is
in contact with the atmosphere during teeming.
11.36 Hydrogen ions dissolve interstitially in solid steel and are thus
able to migrate within the metal, resulting in embrittlement as shown by

Fig. 11.7 Part of the iron-nitrogen thermal equilibrium diagram.
a loss in ductility. This hydrogen may be dissolved during the steel-making
process but is more likely to be introduced from moisture in the flux
coating of electrodes during welding, or released at the surface during an
electroplating or acid-pickling operation. Hydrogen ions released during
surface corrosion may also be absorbed.
The presence of hydrogen in steels can result in so-called 'delayed frac-
ture', that is fracture under a static load during the passage of time. Such
failure may occur after several hours at a stress of no more than 50% of
the 0.2% proof stress. The effect is very dependent on the strain rate so
that whilst ductility is considerably impaired during slow tensile tests,
impact values are little affected.
In steels the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement seems to be associ-
ated with the interstitial movement of hydrogen ions to positions at or near
lattice faults, and also to regions of high tri-axial stress; in each case causing
the nucleation of cracks and consequent premature failure. This would
explain why failure is more likely with the passage of time during which
hydrogen ions are able to migrate. Much of this dissolved hydrogen can
be dispersed during a low-temperature (2000C) annealing process in a
hydrogen-free atmosphere.
The Heat-treatment of Steel
11.40 Because of the solid-state structural changes which take place in
suitable alloys, steels are among the relatively few engineering alloys which
NITROGEN %
0C

can be usefully heat-treated in order to vary their mechanical properties.
This statement refers, of course, to heat-treatments other than simple
stress-relief annealing processes.
Heat-treatments can be applied to steel not only to harden it but also to
improve its strength, toughness or ductility. The type of heat-treatment
used will be governed by the carbon content of the steel and its subsequent
application.
11.41 The various heat-treatment processes can be classified as follows:
(a) annealing;
(b) normalising;
(c) hardening;
(d) tempering;
(e) treatments which depend upon transformations taking place at a
single predetermined temperature during a given period of time (iso-
thermal transformations).
In all of these processes the steel is heated fairly slowly to some predeter-
mined temperature, and then cooled, and it is the rate of cooling which
determines the resultant structure of the steel and, hence, the mechanical
properties associated with it. The final structure will be independent of the
rate of heating, provided this has been slow enough for the steel to reach
structural equilibrium at its maximum temperature. The subsequent rate
of cooling, which determines the nature of the final structure, may vary
between a drastic water-quench and slow cooling in the furnace.
Annealing
11.50 The term 'annealing' describes a number of different thermal treat-
ments which are applied to metals and alloys. Annealing processes for
steels can be classified as follows:
11.51 Stress-relief Annealing The recrystallisation temperature of
mild steel is about 5000C, so that, during a hot-rolling process recrystallis-
ation proceeds simultaneously with rolling. Thus, working stresses are
relieved as they are set up.
Frequently, however, we must apply a considerable amount of cold-
work to mild steels, as, for example, in the drawing of wire. Stress-relief
annealing then becomes necessary to soften the metal so that further draw-
ing operations can be carried out. Such annealing is often referred to as
'process' annealing, and is carried out at about 6500C. Since this tempera-
ture is well above the recrystallisation temperature of 5000C, recrystallis-
ation will be accelerated so that it will be complete in a matter of minutes
on attaining the maximum temperature. Prolonged annealing may in fact
cause a deterioration in properties, since although ductility may increase
further, there will be a loss in strength. A stage will be reached where
grain growth becomes excessive, and where the layers of cementite in the
patches of pearlite begin to coalesce and assume a globular form so that
the identity of the eutectoid is lost (Fig. 11.8). In fact, the end-product

Fig. 11.8 The spheroidisation of pearlitic cementite.
would be isolated globular masses of cementite in a ferrite matrix. The
result of this 'balling-up' of the pearlitic cementite is usually called 'deterio-
rated' pearlite.
It should be noted that process annealing is a sub-critical operation, that
is, it takes place below the lower critical temperature (Ai). Consequently,
reference to the iron-carbon diagram is not involved. Although recrystallis-
ation is promoted by the presence of internal energy remaining from the
previous cold-working process, there is no phase change and the constitu-
ents ferrite and cementite remain in the structure throughout the process.
The balling-up of the pearlitic cementite is purely a result of surface-tension
effects which operate at the temperatures used.
Process annealing is generally carried out in either batch-type or continu-
ous furnaces, usually with some form of inert atmosphere derived from
burnt 'town gas' or other hydrocarbons. The carbon dioxide present in
such mixtures does not react with the surface of iron at the relatively low
temperature of 6500C. At higher temperatures, however, it may behave as
an oxidising agent.
11.52 Spheroidising Anneals The spheroidisation of pearlitic
cementite' may sound a somewhat ponderous phrase. In fact, it refers to
the balling-up of the cementite part of pearlite mentioned above. This
phenomenon is utilised in the softening of tool steels and some of the
air-hardening alloy steels. When in this condition such steels can be drawn
and will also machine relatively freely.
The spheroidised condition is produced by annealing the steel at a tem-
perature between 650 and 7000C, that is, just below the lower critical
temperature (Ai), so that, again, the iron-carbon diagram is not involved
in our study. Whilst no basic phase change takes place, surface tension
causes the cementite to assume a globular form (Fig. 11.8) in a similar way
to which droplets of mercury behave when mercury is spilled. If the layers
of cementite are relatively coarse they take rather a long time to break up,
and this would result in the formation of very large globules of cementite.
This in turn would lead to tearing of the surface during machining. To
obviate these effects it is better to give the steel some form of quenching
treatment prior to annealing in order to refine the distribution of the
cementite. It will then be spheroidised more quickly during annealing and
will produce much smaller globules of cementite. These small globules
will not only improve the surface finish during machining but will also be

dissolved more quickly when the tool is ultimately heated for hardening.
11.53 Annealing of Castings As stated earlier (11.20), the cast struc-
ture of a large body of steel is extremely coarse. This is due mainly to the
slow rates of solidification and subsequent cooling through the austenitic
range. Thus, a 0.35% carbon steel will be completely solid in the region
of 14500C, but, if the casting is large, cooling, due to the lagging effect of
the sand mould, will proceed very slowly down to the point (approximately
8200C) where transformation to ferrite and pearlite begins. By the time
8200C has been reached, therefore, the austenite crystals will be extremely
large. Ferrite, which then begins to precipitate in accordance with the
equilibrium diagram, deposits first at the grain boundaries of the austenite,
thus revealing, in the final structure, the size of the original austenite
grains. The remainder of the ferrite is then precipitated along certain
crystallographic planes within the lattice of the austenite. This gives rise
to a directional precipitation of the ferrite, as shown in Fig. 11.9 and Plate
11.1c, representing typically what is known as a Widmanstatten structure.
This type of structure was first encountered by Widmanstatten in meteor-
ites (10.10), which may be expected to exhibit a coarse structure in view
of the extent to which they are overheated during their passage through
the upper atmosphere. The mesh-like arrangement of ferrite in the Wid-
manstatten structure tends to isolate the stronger pearlite into separate
patches, so that strength, and more particularly toughness, are impaired.
The main characteristics of such a structure are, therefore, weakness and
brittleness, and steps must be taken to remove it either by heat-treatment
or by mechanical working. Hot-working will effectively break up this
coarse as-cast structure and replace it by a fine-grained material, but in this
instance we are concerned with retaining the actual shape of the casting.
Heat-treatment must therefore be used to effect what limited refinement
of grain is possible, but it should be noted that the crystal size after heat
treatment will be greater than that achieved by hot-working.
11.54 The most suitable treatment for a large casting involves heating
it slowly up to a temperature about 400C above its upper critical (thus the
annealing temperature depends upon the carbon content of the steel, as
shown in Fig. 11.10), holding it at that temperature only just long enough
for a uniform temperature to be attained throughout the casting and then
allowing it to cool slowly in the furnace. This treatment not only introduces
the improvements in mechanical properties associated with fine grain but
also removes mechanical strains set up during solidification.
As the lower critical temperature (723°C) is reached on heating, the
patches of pearlite transform to austenite but these new crystals of austen-
ite are very small since each patch of pearlite gives rise to many new austenite
crystals. It is upon this fact that the complete success of this type of
annealing process depends. As the temperature rises, the Widmanstatten-
type plates of ferrite are dissolved by the austenite until, when the upper
critical temperature is reached, the structure consists entirely of fine-
grained austenite. Cooling causes reprecipitation of the ferrite, but, since
the new austenite crystals are small, the precipitated ferrite will also be
distributed as small particles. Finally, as the lower critical temperature is

11.56 Overheating during annealing, or heating for too long a period
in the austenitic range, will obviously cause grain growth of the newly
formed austenite crystals, leading to a structure almost as bad as the origi-
nal Widmanstatten structure. For this reason the requisite annealing tem-
perature should not be exceeded, and the casting should remain in the
austenitic range only for as long as is necessary to make it completely
austenitic. In fact, castings are sometimes air-cooled to about 6500C and
then cooled more slowly to room temperature, by returning to a furnace
to prevent stresses due to rapid cooling from being set up.
11.57 Excessive overheating will probably cause oxidation, or 'burn-
ing', of the surface, and the penetration by oxide films of the crystal boun-
daries following decarburisation of the surface. Such damage cannot be

repaired by heat-treatment, and the castings can only be scrapped. To
prevent 'burning' some form of inert atmosphere must be used in the
annealing furnace in order to limit contact between the castings and
atmospheric oxygen.
11.58 If annealing is carried out at too low a temperature, remnants of
the as-cast structure will be apparent in the form of undissolved skeletons
of Widmanstatten ferrite. As the temperature falls on cooling, the ferrite
which did dissolve tends to reprecipitate on the existing ferrite skeleton so
that the final structure resembles the unannealed.
Normalising
11.60 Normalising resembles the 'full' annealing of castings described in
11.53 in that the maximum temperature attained is similar. It is in the
method of cooling that the processes differ. Whilst, in annealing, cooling
is retarded, in normalising the steel is removed from the furnace and
allowed to cool in still air. This relatively rapid method of cooling limits
grain growth in normalising, whilst the ferrite/cementite lamellae in pearl-
ite will also be much finer. For both reasons the mechanical properties are
somewhat better than in an annealed component. Moreover, the surface
finish of a normalised article is often superior to that of an annealed one
when machined, since the high ductility of the latter often gives rise to
local tearing of the surface.
11.61 The type of structure obtained by normalising will depend largely
upon the thickness of cross-section, as this will affect the rate of cooling.
Thin sections will give a much finer grain than thick sections, the latter
differing little in structure from an annealed section.

The Heat-Treatment of
Plain Carbon Steels—(H)
12.10 In the previous chapter those heat-treatment processes were dis-
cussed in which the steel component was permitted to reach a state of
thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature. That is, cooling took place
sufficiently slowly to allow a pearlitic type of microstructure to form. Such
treatments are normally only useful for improving the toughness and duc-
tility of a steel component, and when increased hardness is required it is
necessary to quench, or cool, the component sufficiently rapidly, in order
to prevent the normal pearlitic structure from being formed. If a combi-
nation of strength and toughness is necessary then a further 'tempering'
process may follow quenching. Alternatively one of the isothermal treat-
ments may be used to replace the dual treatments of quenching and tem-
pering.
12.11 Prior to the development of metallurgy as a science many of the
processes associated with the hardening of steel were clothed in mystery.
For example, it was thought that the water of Sheffield possessed certain
magical properties, and it is said that an astute Yorkshire business man
once exported it in barrels to Japan at considerable profit. In point of fact
the high quality of Sheffield steel was a measure of the craftsmanship used
in its production. Similarly, it is reported that Damascus steel swords were
hardened by plunging the blade, whilst hot, into the newly decapitated
body of a slave and stirring vigorously. Some metallurgists have suggested,
possibly more out of cynicism than scientific accuracy, that hardening
would be assisted by nitrogen absorption from the blood of the slave during
this somewhat gruesome procedure. James Bowie, originator of the Bowie
knife in the days of the 'Wild West', is said to have quenched his knives
nine times in succession in panther oil.
In this chapter, then, we shall deal with the production of structures,
other than pear lite, in plain carbon steels, and seek to explain the relation-
ship which exists between the mechanical properties and the crystal struc-
ture produced by the treatments employed.
12

Hardening
12.20 When a piece of steel, containing sufficient carbon, is cooled
rapidly from above its upper critical temperature it becomes considerably
harder than it would be if allowed to cool slowly. The degree of hardness
produced can vary, and is dependent upon such factors as the initial
quenching temperature; the size of the work; the constitution, properties
and temperature of the quenching medium; and the degree of agitation
and final temperature of the quenching medium.
12.21 Whenever a metallic alloy is quenched there is a tendency to
suppress structural change or transformation. Frequently, therefore, it is
possible to 'trap' a metallic structure as it existed at a higher temperature
and so preserve it at room temperature. This is usually an easy matter with
alloys in which transformation is sluggish, but in iron-carbon alloys the
reverse tends to be the case. Here, transformation, particularly that of
austenite to pearlite, is rapid and is easily accomplished during ordinary
air-cooling to ambient temperature. This is due largely to the polymorphic
transformation which takes place but also to rapid diffusion of carbon
atoms in the face-centred cubic lattice of iron. The rapid diffusion of carbon
atoms is a result of their smaller size and the fact that they dissolve intersti-
tially (This also leads to the absence of coring with respect to carbon in
cast steels.)
When a plain carbon steel is quenched from its austenitic range it is not
possible to trap austenite and so preserve it at room temperature. Instead,
one or other phases is obtained intermediate between austenite on the one
hand and pearlite on the other. These phases vary in degree of hardness,
but all are harder than either pearlite or austenite.
12.22 Water quenching of a steel containing sufficient carbon produces
an extremely hard structure called martensite which appears under the
microscope as a mass of uniform needle-shaped crystals (Plate 12.1A).
These 'needles' are in fact cross-sections through lens- or discus-shaped
crystals—another instance of the misleading impression sometimes given
by the two-dimensional image offered by the metallurgical microscope.
Since martensite is of uniform appearance even at very high magnifications
it follows that the carbon is still in solution in the iron and has not been
precipitated as iron carbide as it would have been if the steel had been
cooled under equilibrium conditions. However, X-ray crystallographic
examination of martensite shows that despite very rapid cooling which
has prevented the precipitation of iron carbide, the lattice structure has
nevertheless changed from FCC (face-centred cubic) to something
approaching the BCC (body-centred cubic) structure which is normally
present in a steel cooled slowly to ambient temperature. This BCC type
structure is considerably supersaturated with carbon since at ambient tem-
peratures only 0.006% carbon is retained in solution under equilibrium
conditions. Consequently the presence of dissolved carbon in amounts of,
say, 0.5% can be expected to cause considerable distortion of the structure
and in fact produces one which is body-centred tetragonal.

The transformation of a single crystal of martensite from austenite
appears to be achieved in about 10~7 seconds. How can this change in
structure take place so rapidly? It is suggested that a process of diffusionless
phase transformation is involved, that is, there is an extremely limited
movement of iron and carbon atoms into positions more nearly approach-
ing equilibrium at the lower temperature. The lattice structure of austenite
is represented in Fig. 12.1. This is the FCC structure with carbon atoms
able to occupy interstitial positions as indicated*. If we regard the superim-
posed figure, indicated in heavier line with a base ABCD, this shows how
FCC austenite can be regarded as a body-centred tetragonal structure and
it is thought that martensite transformation involves a change from this
structure to a true body-centred tetragonal structure with very little
consequent movement of the iron atoms. In Fig. 12.2 the alteration in
dimensions of a unit cell from the original austenite to the new BCT
(body-centred tetragonal) is indicated. Thus the unit becomes more 'squat'
in shape as the 'a0' axis shrinks and the ao/V^T axis expands. But for the
presence of the carbon atoms inherited from the austenite the structure
would transform to simple BCC ferrite. The interstitially dissolved carbon
atoms have little chance to move and must fit into the new structure where
they will cause considerable distortion since in a body-centred structure
there are far fewer interstitial sites available. Since not all of the interstitial
sites will be occupied by carbon atoms a structure something like that
shown in Fig. 12.3 will form.
Fig. 12.1 The face-centred cubic structure of austenite showing its relationship to a body-
centred tetragonal cell based on ABCD.
The actual change from FCC to BCT involves a very small movement
of atoms and probably proceeds in a manner similar to that in mechanical
twinning. Movement of dislocations due to the shear involved can have an
effect akin to severe work-hardening. This, in conjunction with the great
distortion produced by the interstitial carbon atoms helps to explain the
great hardness and negligible ductility of martensite. The presence of any
carbon in excess of 0.02% will frustrate the formation of a simple BCC
structure when such a steel is quenched from the austenitic range. The

degree of distortion existing in the resulting tetragonal martensite will be
proportional to the overall carbon content. Consequently as the carbon
content increases so does hardness.
Less severe quenching gives rise to a structure known as Bainite. This
phase appears under the microscope, at magnifications in the region of
x 100, as black patches (Plates 12.1 B and c), but a higher magnification
of x 1000 shows that it is of a laminated nature something like pearlite.
The growth of bainite (Fig. 12.4) differs from that of pearlite in that ferrite
nucleates first followed by carbide, whereas in pearlite it is the carbide

which nucleates first (8.43). Bainite growth takes place quickly because
the driving force is increased by a greater degree of non-equilibrium at the
lower temperatures at which it is formed. Consequently particle size is too
small to be seen by low-power microscopy.
Still slower rates of cooling produce normal pearlite, the coarseness of
the ferrite and cementite laminations depending upon the rate of cooling.
Thus, normalising leads to the formation of a fairly fine-grained structure
whilst annealing produces coarse-grained structures.
12.23 In practice, factors such as composition, size and shape of the
component to be hardened dictate the rate at which it shall be cooled.
Generally no attempt is made to harden plain carbon steels which contain
less than 0.25% carbon since the increase in hardness produced would be
so small and non-uniform for reasons which will become apparent later in
this chapter (12.45). Large masses of steel of heavy section will obviously
cool more slowly than small articles of thin section when quenched, so that
whilst the surface skin may be martensitic, the core of a large section may
be bainitic because it has cooled more slowly. If, however, small amounts
of such elements as nickel, chromium or manganese are added to the steel,
it will be found that the martensitic layer is much thicker than with a plain
carbon steel of similar carbon content and dimensions which has been
cooled at the same rate. Alloying elements therefore 'increase the depth
of hardening', and they do so by slowing down the transformation rates.
This is a most important feature, since it enables an alloy steel to be
hardened by much less drastic quenching methods than are necessary for
a plain carbon steel. The liability to produce quench-cracks, which are
often the result of water-quenching, is reduced in this way. Design also
affects the susceptibility to quench-cracking. Sharp variations in cross-
section and the presence of sharp angles, grooves, notches and rectangular
holes are all likely to cause the formation of quench-cracks. Consequently

when mass production is involved it is often more satisfactory to use a
low-alloy steel containing small amounts of the cheaper elements like man-
ganese which can then be oil quenched on a conveyor-belt system. This
not only cuts labour costs but eliminates the human element from quench-
ing, as well as minimising distortion and cracking and providing a more
uniform product.
12.24 The quenching medium is chosen according to the rate at which
it is desired to cool the steel. The following list of media is arranged in
order of quenching speeds:
5% Caustic soda
5-20% Brine
Cold water
Warm water
Mineral oil
Animal oil
Vegetable oil
The very drastic quench resulting from the use of caustic soda solution is
used only when extreme hardness is required in components of simple
shape. For more complicated shapes an oil-quenched alloy steel would give
better results. Originally animal oils obtained from the blubber of seal and
whale were used for this purpose, but the near extinction of the whale has
brought to an end the extremely barbaric practice of whaling by all civilised
nations. (We must be vigilant nevertheless that whaling does not begin
again as apparently there are considerable numbers of so-called gourmets
in some countries who wish to eat these noble mammals.) Most quenching
oils are now of mineral origin and are obtained during the refining of crude
petroleum.
In addition to the rate of heat abstraction such factors as flash point,
viscosity and chemical stability are important. A high flash point is neces-
sary to reduce fire risks, whilst high viscosity will lead to loss of oil by
'drag-out', ie oil clinging to the work piece as it is withdrawn from the
quenching bath. Atmospheric oxidation and other chemical changes gener-
ally led to a thickening of whale oil and the formation of thick scum. On
the other hand some mineral oils 'crack' or break down to simpler com-
pounds of lower boiling point which will volatilise in use leaving a thicker,
more viscous mixture behind.
Water solutions of synthetic polymers such as polyalkalene glycol are
now replacing oils for many quenching operations. Not only do they elimin-
ate fire risks, smoke and unpleasant fume but are generally less expensive.
Moreover, having lower viscosities, loss by drag-out is reduced. Less con-
tamination of the work results and degreasing prior to subsequent oper-
ations is unnecessary.
12.25. To harden a piece of steel, then, it must be heated to between
30 and 500C above its upper critical temperature and then quenched in
some medium which will produce in it the desired rate of cooling. The
medium used will depend upon the composition of the steel and the ulti-

mate properties required. Symmetrically shaped components are best
quenched 'end-on', and all components should be agitated in the medium
during quenching.
Tempering
12.30 A fully hardened carbon tool steel is relatively brittle, and the
presence of stresses set up by quenching make its use, in this condition,
inadvisable except in cases where extreme hardness is required. Hence it
is customary to re-heat—or 'temper'—the quenched component so that
internal stresses will be relieved and brittleness reduced. Medium-carbon
constructional steels are also tempered but here the temperatures are
somewhat higher so that strength and hardness are sacrificed to some
extent in favour of greater toughness and ductility.
12.31 During tempering, which is always carried out below the lower
critical temperature, martensite tends to transform to the equilibrium struc-
ture of ferrite and cementite. The higher the tempering temperature the
more closely will the original martensitic structure revert to this ferrite-
cementite mixture and so strength and hardness fall progressively, whilst
toughness and ductility increase (Fig. 12.5). Thus by choosing the appropri-

ate tempering temperature a wide range of mechanical properties can be
achieved in carbon steels.
12.32 The structural changes which occur during the tempering of mar-
tensite containing more than 0.3% carbon, take place in three stages:
1st Stage At about 1000C, or possibly even lower, the existing marten-
site begins to transform to another form of martensite, containing only
0.25% carbon, together with very fine particles of a carbide. However, this
carbide is not ordinary cementite but one containing rather more carbon
and of a formula approximately FesC2. It is designated e-carbide. No alter-
ation in the microstructure is apparent under an ordinary optical micro-
scope because the e-carbide particles are so small, but the electron
microscope reveals them as films about 2 x 10~8m thick. At this stage
a slight increase in hardness may occur because of the presence of the
finely-dispersed but hard e-carbide. Brittleness is significantly reduced as
quenching stresses disappear in consequence of the transformation. At
1000C the transformation proceeds very slowly but increases in speed up
to 2000C.
2nd Stage This begins at about 2500C when any 'retained austenite'
(12.43) begins to transform to bainite. This will cause the martensite
'needles' to etch a darker colour and formerly this type of structure was
known as troostite. A further slight increase in hardness may result from
the replacement of austenite by much harder bainite.
3rd Stage At about 3500C the e-carbide begins to transform to ordinary
cementite and this continues as the temperature rises. In the meantime the
remainder of the carbon begins to precipitate from the martensite—also
as cementite—and in consequence the martensite structure gradually
reverts to one of ordinary BCC ferrite. Above 5000C the cementite par-
ticles coalesce into larger rounded globules in the ferrite matrix. This struc-
ture was formerly called sorbite but both this term and that of troostite are
now no longer used by metallurgists who prefer to describe these structures
as 'tempered martensite'.
Due to the increased carbide precipitation which occurs as the tempera-
ture rises the structure becomes weaker but more ductile, though above
5500C strength falls fairly rapidly with little rise in ductility (Fig. 12.5).
12.33 Tempering can be carried out in a number of ways, but, in all,
the temperature needs to be fairly accurately controlled. As the steel is
heated, the oxide film which begins to form on a bright, clean surface
first assumes a pale-yellow colour and gradually thickens with increase in
temperature until it is dark blue. This is a useful guide to the tempering
of tools in small workshops where pyrometer-controlled tempering fur-
naces are not available and is the time-honoured method of heat-treating
high-quality hand-made wood-working tools. Table 12.1 shows typical
colours obtained on clean surfaces when a variety of components are tem-
pered to suitable temperatures. Such a colour-temperature relationship is
only applicable to plain carbon steels. Stainless steels, for example, oxidise
less easily, so that the colours obtained will bear no relationship to the
temperatures indicated in the table. Moreover, the oxide film colour is
only a reliable guide when the component has been progressively raised in

temperature. It does not apply to one which has been maintained at a fixed
temperature for some time, since here the oxide film will be thicker and
darker in any case. In addition, the human element must also be taken
into account, so that, in general, tempering in a pyrometer-controlled
furnace is more successful.
12.34 Furnaces used for tempering are usually of the batch type (13.20
—Part II). They employ either a circulating atmosphere or are of the
liquid-bath type. Liquids transfer heat more uniformly and have a greater
heat capacity, and this ensures an even temperature throughout the fur-
nace. For low temperatures oils are often used, but higher temperatures
demand the use of salt baths containing various mixtures of sodium nitrite
and potassium nitrate. These baths can be used at about 5000C, but above
that temperature either mixtures of chlorides or lead baths are necessary.
Another popular furnace, in which the temperature can be varied easily
and controlled thermostatically, is the circulating-air type. Here, uniform
temperatures up to 6500C can be obtained by using fans to circulate the
atmosphere, first over electric heaters, and then through a wire basket
holding the charge.
Failing a pyrometer-controlled furnace, temperature-indicating paints
and crayons are useful in determining the tempering temperature of small
components, provided some method of uniform heating is available. Such
indicators do indeed record the actual temperature reached by the
component, which is more than can be said for a pyrometer controlling a
furnace which is in the hands of an unskilled operative.

Isothermal Transformations
12.40 As pointed out earlier in this chapter (12.22), the microstructure
and properties of a quenched steel are dependent upon the rate of cooling
which prevails during quenching. This relationship, between structure and
rate of cooling, can be studied for a given steel with the help of a set of
isothermal transformation curves which are known as TTT (Time-Temper-
ature-Transformation) curves. The TTT curves for a steel of eutectoid
composition are shown in Fig. 12.6. They indicate the time necessary for
transformation to take place and the structure which will be produced when
austenite is supercooled to any predetermined transformation temperature.
12.41 Such curves are constructed by taking a large number of similar
specimens of the steel in question and heating them to just inside the
austenitic range. These specimens are divided into groups each of which

is quickly transferred to an 'incubation' bath at a different temperature.
At predetermined time intervals individual specimens are removed from
their baths and quenched in water. The microstructure is then examined
to see the extent to which transformation had taken place at the holding
temperature. Let us assume, for example, that we have heated a number
of specimens of eutectoid steel to just above 723°C and have then quenched
them into molten lead at 5000C (Figs. 12.6 and 12.7). Until one second
has elapsed transformation has not begun, and if we remove a specimen
from the bath in less than a second, and then quench it in water, we shall
obtain a completely martensitic structure, proving that at 5000C after one
second (4A' on Figs. 12.6 and 12.7) the steel was still completely austenitic.
The production of martensite in the viewed structure is entirely due to the
final water-quench. If we allow the specimen to remain at 5000C for ten
seconds ('B' on Figs. 12.6 and 12.7) and then water-quench it, we shall
find that the structure is composed entirely of bainite in feather-shaped
patches, showing that after ten seconds at 5000C transformation to bainite
was complete. If we quenched a specimen after it had been held at 5000C
for five seconds ('C on Figs. 12.6 and 12.7) we would obtain a mixture of
bainite and martensite, showing that, at the holding temperature (5000C),
the structure had contained a mixture of bainite and austenite due to the
incomplete transformation of the latter. By repeating such treatments at
different holding temperatures we are able, by interpreting the resulting
microstructures, to construct TTT curves of the type shown in Fig. 12.6.
Because of the very rapid transformations, austenite -» martensite (and
even austenite —» pearlite) which are involved, it is obvious that consider-
able practical difficulties arise during laboratory investigations of this type.
Since it is impossible to change the temperature from 7300C to 5000C (in
the example described above) in zero time and again from 5000C to 00C in
zero time, we must do the best we can by using very small specimens
which are thin enough to reach quenching bath temperatures as quickly as
possible. For this reason small specimens about the size of a Ip piece are
appropriate (Fig. 12.8). These can be attached to suitable 'handles' to
facilitate their very rapid transfer between baths. If the incubation bath is
of molten metal this will also provide the maximum quenching rate on
transfer from the austenitising bath.
12.42 The horizontal line (Fig. 12.6) representing the temperature of
723°C is, of course, the lower critical temperature above which the struc-
ture of the eutectoid steel in question consists entirely of stable austenite.
Below this line austenite is unstable, and the two approximately C-shaped
curves indicate the time necessary for the austenite —> ferrite + cementite
transformation to begin and to be completed following rapid quenching to
any predetermined temperature. Transformation is sluggish at tempera-
tures just below the lower critical, but the delay in starting, and the time
required for completion, decrease as the temperature falls towards 5500C.
In this range the greater the degree of undercooling, the greater is the urge
for the austenite to transform, and the rate of transformation reaches a
maximum at 5500C. At temperatures just below 723°C, where transforma-
tion takes place slowly, the structure formed will be coarse pearlite, since

there is plenty of time for diffusion to take place. In the region just above
5500C, however, rapid transformation results in the formation of very fine
pearlite.
12.43 At temperatures between 550 and 2200C transformation becomes
more sluggish as the temperature falls, for, although austenite becomes
increasingly unstable, the slower rate of diffusion of carbon atoms in aus-
tenite at lower temperatures outstrips the increased urge of the austenite
to transform. In this temperature range the transformation product is bain-
ite. The appearance of this phase may vary between a feathery mass of fine
cementite and ferrite for bainite formed around 4500C; and dark acicular
(needle-shaped) crystals for bainite formed in the region of 2500C.
The horizontal lines at the foot of the diagram are, strictly speaking,
not part of the TTT curves, but represent the temperatures at which the
formation of martensite will begin (M5) and end (M/) during cooling of
austenite through this range. It will be noted that the M/ line corresponds
approximately to — 500C. Consequently if the steel is quenched in water at
room temperature, some 'retained austenite' can be expected in the struc-
ture since at room temperature transformation is incomplete. This retained
austenite, however, will amount to less than 5% of the austenite which
was present at the Ms temperature. In fact, at 1100C (Fig. 12.6) 90% of
the austenite will have transformed to martensite.
12.44 These TTT curves indicate structures which are produced by
transformations which take place isothermally, that is, at a fixed single
temperature and specify a given 'incubation' period which must elapse
before transformation begins. There is no direct connection between such
isothermal transformations and transformations which take place under
continuous cooling at a constant rate from 723°C to room temperature.
Thus it is not possible to superimpose curves which represent continuous
cooling on to a TTT diagram. Modified TTT curves which are related to
continuous rates of cooling can, however, be produced. These are similar

in shape to the true TTT curves, but are displaced to the right, as shown
in Fig. 12.9. On this diagram are superimposed four curves, A, B, C and
D, which represent different rates of cooling.
Curve A represents a rate of cooling of approximately 5°C per second
such as might be encountered during normalising. Here transformation
will begin at X and can be completed at Y, the final structure being one
of fine pear lite. Curve B, on the other hand, represents very rapid cooling
at a rate of approximately 4000C per second. This is typical of conditions
prevailing during a water-quench, and transformation will not begin until
2200C, when martensite begins to form. The structure will consist of 90%
martensite at 1100C and so contain a little retained austenite at room
temperature. The lowest rate at which this steel (of eutectoid composition)
can be quenched, in order to obtain a structure which is almost wholly
martensitic, is represented by curve C (1400C per second). This is called
the critical cooling rate for the steel, and if a rate lower than this is used
some fine pearlite will be formed. For example, in the case of the curve
D, which represents a cooling rate of about 500C per second, transforma-
tion would begin at P with the formation of some fine pearlite. Transforma-
tion, however, is interrupted in the region of Q and does not begin again

until the M8 line is reached at R, when the remaining austenite begins to
transform to martensite. Thus the final structure at room temperature is a
mixture of pearlite, martensite and traces of retained austenite.
12.45 The TTT curves illustrated in Hg. 12.6 are those for a steel of
eutectoid composition. If the carbon content is either above or below this,
the curves will be displaced to the left so that the critical cooling rate
necessary to produce a completely martensitic structure will be greater. In
order to obtain a structure which is entirely martensitic the steel must be
cooled at such a rate that the curve representing its rate of cooling does
not cut into the 'nose' of the modified 'transformation begins' curve in the
region of 5500C. Obviously, if the steel remains in this temperature range
for more than one second, then transformation to pearlite will begin.
Hence the need for drastic water-quenches to produce wholly martensitic
structures in plain carbon steels.
For a steel containing less than 0.3% carbon the transformation-begins
curve has moved so far to the left (Fig. 12.10(i)) that it has become imposs-
ible to obtain a wholly martensitic structure however rapidly it is cooled.
Large quantities of ferrite will inevitably precipitate when the transforma-
tion-begins curve is unavoidably cut in the upper temperature ranges. The
resulting structure will be most unsatisfactory since hard martensite will be
interspersed with soft ferrite.
Fortunately, the addition of alloying elements has the effect of slowing
down transformation rates so that the TTT curves are displaced to the
right of the diagram. This means that much slower rates of cooling can be
used, in the form of oil- or even air-quenches, and a martensitic structure
still obtained. Small amounts of elements, such as nickel, chromium and
manganese, are effective in this way and this is one of the most important
effects of alloying. In Fig. 12.10(ii) representing the TTT curves for a low
alloy steel (covered by BS970:945M38) the 'nose' of the transformation-

begins curve is displaced well to the right and in fact a 'double nose' is
formed. Even when a continuous-cooling curve (representing an oil-
quench) is superimposed on this isothermal diagram, it will be seen that
there is no transformation until the M8 line is reached and the structures
will be wholly martensitic. Since this diagram represents the TTT curves
for a hypo-eutectoid steel, ferrite precipitation will begin before pearlite
formation as indicated by the broken line.
12.46 We will now consider one or two practical applications arising
from this study of modified isothermal transformation curves. Let us first
examine the conditions under which a fairly large body of steel will cool,
when quenched. The core will cool less quickly than the outside skin, and
since its cooling curve B (Fig. 12.11A) cuts into the nose of the 'transforma-
tion-begins' curve, we can expect to find some fine pearlite in the core,
whilst the surface layer is entirely martensitic. This feature is usually
referred to as the 'mass effect of heat-treatment' (12.50). Even if we are
able to cool the component quickly enough to obtain a completely mar-
tensitic structure, as indicated in Fig. 12.11B there will be such a consider-
able time interval CD between both core and surface reaching a martensitic
condition that this will lead to quench-cracks being formed. These cracks
will be caused by stresses set up as the volume change, associated with the
austenite —> martensite transformation, progresses from the skin to the
core of the section. Supposing, however, we cool the steel under conditions
of the kind indicated in Fig. 12.11c. Here the steel is quenched into a bath
at temperature E and left there long enough to permit it to reach a uniform
temperature throughout. It is then removed from the bath and allowed to
cool so that martensite will begin to form at F. The net result is that, by
allowing the core to attain the same temperature as the surface whilst in
the bath at temperature E, we have prevented a big temperature gradient
from being set up between the surface and the core of the specimen at the
moment when martensite begins to form. The final air-cooling will not be
rapid enough to allow a large temperature gradient to be set up, and both
core and surface will become martensitic at approximately the same time,
thus minimising the tendency towards quench-cracking. The success of this
treatment, which is known either as martempering or mar quenching lies in
cooling the steel quickly enough past the 'nose' of the modified transforma-
tion-begins curve. Once safely past that point, relatively slow cooling will
precipitate martensite. If we should cut into the 'nose' fine pearlite will
begin to form. It is obvious that for plain carbon steels this type of treat-
ment will have its limitations and will be applicable to components of thin
section only, otherwise the temperature gradient set up within the section
would be too great to prevent pearlite formation in the core.
With suitable steels an ausforming operation can be combined with mar-
tempering. Whilst the steel is at the holding temperature the austenitic
structure is heavily worked—up to 90% sectional reduction in area being
applied. The density of dislocations is increased by working and these
'jammed' dislocations are retained because the relatively low temperature
does not permit recrystallisation. The steel is then allowed to cool and so
transform to martensite which will retain the high density of dislocations,

show how these effects may be largely overcome in martempering and austempering.
so that its strength is further increased. Moreover, the grain is fine due to
the low forming temperature, whilst a fine dispersion of carbides, presum-
ably deposited during forming, contributes some degree of particle harden-
ing. Some low-alloy steels, having a deep 'bay' between the pearlite and
bainite 'noses' of the TTT curve (Fig. 12.10(ii)) can be treated in this way
and will develop tensile strengths in the region of 3000 N/mm2.
12.47 Isothermal transformation offers a method by which we can
obtain a tempered type of structure without the preliminary drastic water-

quench. Such a treatment, known as austempering, is illustrated in Fig.
12.HD. Here the steel is quenched into a bath at a temperature above
that at which martensite can be formed and allowed to remain there long
enough for transformation to be complete at G. Since transformation to
bainite is complete at G, the steel can be cooled to room temperature at
any desired rate, but air-cooling is preferable. We have thus succeeded in
obtaining a structure which is similar in properties, though not in micro-
structure, to that of tempered martensite which is obtained by quenching
and tempering. The drastic water-quench from above the upper critical
temperature, however, has been avoided. Austempering is therefore a
process of considerable importance when heat-treating components of
intricate section. Such components might distort or crack if they were
heat-treated by the more conventional methods of quenching and tem-
pering.
Although most of our njodern knowledge of the basic mechanisms of
isothermal transformation phenomena stem from the research carried out
by Bain and Davenport from the late nineteen-thirties onwards, industrial
processes based on what we now understand as isothermal transformation
in steel, predated the work of Bain and his associates by many years.
Such a process was patenting, a treatment employed in the manufacture of
high-tensile steel wire. This wire, containing between 0.35 and 0.95%
carbon, is first austenitised at temperatures up to 9700C (depending of
course on the carbon content) by passing it through heated tubes in order
to minimise decarburisation. From the austenitising furnace it passes into
a bath of molten lead at 400-5000C where it remains for a period long
enough for a structure of feathery bainite to develop. This structure is
sufficiently ductile to permit cold-working of up to 90% sectional reduction
in area, without annealing being necessary. Tensile strengths of over 2000
N/mm2 are attainable as a result of the combination of heat-treatment and
cold-work. Wire for piano, guitar and other musical instrument strings can
be made in this way as well as high-tensile wire ropes.
The heat-treatment of spades, forks and other thin-section garden tools
by a method akin to austempering also pre-dated Bain by many years.
There are many such instances where industrial processes were developed
by trial and error over many years, long before the underlying scientific
explanation was forthcoming. Nevertheless modern austempering pro-
cesses are finding increasing use. For example, even the steel toecaps of
industrial boots are heat-treated in this manner.
12.48 Finally, mention must be made of isothermal annealing. In this
process the steel is heated into the austenitic range and then allowed to
transform as completely as possible in the pearlitic range. The object of
such treatment is generally to soften the steel sufficiently for subsequent
cold-forming or machining operations.
The nature of the pearlite formed during transformation is influenced by
the initial austenitising temperature. An austenitising temperature which is
little above the upper critical for the steel promotes the formation of sphe-
roidal pearlitic cementite during isothermal annealing, whilst a higher
austenitising temperature favours the formation of lamellar pearlitic

cementite. The pearlite structure is also influenced by the temperature
at which isothermal transformation takes place, as would be expected.
Transformation just below the lower critical temperature leads to the for-
mation of spheroidal pearlitic cementite since precipitation is slow, whilst
at lower temperatures transformation rates are higher and lamellar cement-
ite tends to form. A structure containing spheroidal cementite is generally
preferred for lathe work and cold-forming operations, whilst one with
lamellar cementite is often used where milling or drilling are involved. It
is claimed that isothermal annealing gives more uniform properties than
does an ordinary annealing process.
Hardenability and Ruling Section
12.50 Brief mention of the workshop term 'mass effect' in connection
with the heat treatment of steel has already been made (12.46). If a piece
of carbon steel is of heavy cross-section it will probably be impossible
to cool it quickly enough to produce a uniformly martensitic structure
throughout, even by the most severe quenching. Such a section would be
likely to have a soft un-hardened core due to its relatively slow cooling
rate (Fig. 12.11A), whilst a piece of steel of thin section quenched in a
similar way would be martensitic throughout (Fig. 12.12). This difficulty
may be remedied to some extent by adding alloying elements to the steel.
These reduce the critical rates of austenite transformation and make it
possible to get a martensitic structure throughout quite thick sections even
when the less drastic oil- or air-quenching processes are used.
12.51 This is one of the most important functions of alloying, but to
avoid the misuse of steels due to lack of understanding of their properties
it became necessary for manufacturers to specify the maximum diameter
or ruling section of a bar, up to which the stated mechanical properties
would apply following heat-treatment. That is, some users failed to
appreciate that these low-alloy steels still had a critical cooling rate even
though it was much lower than that of a plain carbon steel of similar carbon

tions will cool too slowly to be entirely martensitic.

content. If the ruling section is exceeded then the properties across the
section will not be uniform since hardening of the core will not be complete.
12.52 The Jominy end-quench test is of great practical use in determin-
ing the hardenability of steel. Here a standard test piece is made (Fig.
12.13A) and heated up to its austenitic state. It is then dropped into position
in a frame, as shown in Fig. 12.13B, and quenched at its end only, by
means of a pre-set standard jet of water at 25°C. Thus different rates of
cooling are obtained along the length of the bar. After the cooling, a
'flat', 0.4 mm deep, is ground along the side of the bar and hardness
determinations made every millimetre along the length from the quenched
end. The results are then plotted as in Fig. 12.14.
These curves show that the depth of hardening of a nickel-chromium
steel is greater than that of a plain carbon steel of similar carbon content,
whilst the depth of hardening of a chromium-molybdenum steel is greater
than that of the nickel-chromium steel.
With modifications, the results of the Jominy test can be used as a basis
in estimating the 'ruling section' of a particular steel. There is no simple
mathematical relationship between the two, however, and it is often more
satisfactory to find by trial and error how a particular section will harden,
after a preliminary Jominy test has been conducted.

British Standard Specifications for Carbon
Steels
12.60 British Standard Specifications for wrought steels containing
carbon and manganese (including some free-cutting steels) are dealt with
in Part 1 of BS 970. The original 'En' designation which was used to
identify individual steels within BS 970 was abandoned as long ago as 1972
but 'old habits die hard' and one still finds these En numbers being quoted.
Some claim that the new numbers are 'too cumbersome' but in fact they
are very useful in that the six digit designation used indicates both carbon
and manganese contents as well as other important information relating to
supply of the steel.
The series 000 to 199 has been allocated for the first three digits in
respect of steels containing carbon and manganese. These digits represent
one hundred times the mean manganese content. The letter 'A' or 'M' has
been introduced as the fourth digit to indicate whether the steel is to be
supplied to analysis (A) or mechanical property (M) requirements. When
hardenability requirements are included in the specification the letter 'H'
is used as the fourth digit. Finally the fifth and sixth digits represent one
hundred times the mean carbon content. (Since only one steel in this Part
of the standard contains 1.00% carbon, the two digits '99' are used to
describe it so as to avoid the use of a three-digit suffix throughout the
standard.)
As an example BS 970:060A52 describes a steel containing 0.50-0.55%
carbon; 0.50-0.70% manganese supplied according to analysis (A)
requirements.
The free-cutting carbon-manganese steels (6.63) are prefixed by the

Exercises
1. Examine Table 12.2 and explain why the following steels (covered in BS 970):
070M20; 080M30; 080M40 and 080M50 have progressively lower normalising
and quenching temperatures. (12.20)
2. Outline, using sketches, the theory which seeks to explain the development of
the martensite structure when a carbon steel is water quenched. (12.22)
3. An annealed 0.4% C steel bar is cold-worked and placed with one end in a
furnace at 9000C whilst the other end is maintained at room temperature. After
a few hours the bar is quenched in cold water. Describe the structures you would
expect to find along the length of the bar. (11.51 and 12.21)
4. Sketch and label the 'steel part' of the iron-carbon thermal equilibrium diagram.
With reference to the diagram describe the structural changes which occur when
a cast 0.5%C steel is:
(i) slowly heated to 9000C;
(ii) slowly cooled from 9000C;
(hi) quenched from 9000C;
(iv) quenched from 9000C and reheated to 6500C.
Sketch each microstructure, including that of the steel in the cast condition,
and comment qualitatively on the mechanical properties you would expect
as a result of each treatment. (11.53, 12.21 and 12.32)
5. Both annealing and tempering are processes used to soften steel. Outline the
conditions when these treatments would be used, and indicate any difficulties
that may be encountered in practice. (11.50 and 12.30)
6. Four thin pieces of the same 0.8% C rolled-steel rod are heat-treated differently
as follows:
(i) heated to 6800C for twenty-four hours and cooled in still air;
(ii) water-quenched from 7500C;
(iii) heated to 7300C, quenched into molten lead at 4000C, allowed to remain
there for five minutes and then cooled;

Alloy Steels
13.10 The earliest recorded attempt to produce an alloy steel was made
in 1822 at the instigation of Michael Faraday in his searches for better
cutting tools and non-corrodible metals for reflectors. To develop the latter
he attempted to alloy iron with a number of rare elements including silver,
gold, platinum and rhodium, and, incidentally chromium; but it was not
until ninety years later that in 1922 Brearley discovered the stainless
properties of high-chromium steel.
The first successful attempt at producing an alloy steel was the result of
the researches of the British metallurgist Robert Mushet, who had made
Henry Bessemer's process a viable proposition by introducing deoxidation
with manganese. Mushet's 'self-hardening' tungsten-manganese steel pro-
duced in 1868 was indeed the forerunner of modern high-speed steel.
Systematic research into the properties of alloy steels dates from Sir
Robert Hadfield's discovery of high-manganese steel in 1882. Some time
afterward Dr. J. E. Stead said of this steel: 'Hadfield had surprised the
whole metallurgical world with the results obtained. The material produced
was one of the most marvellous ever brought before the public' Large
quantities of this alloy are produced to-day by the Sheffield firm which still
carries the inventor's name. Indeed the prowess of the Sheffield steelmak-
ers of the nineteenth century confirms the maxim that 'the hand which
wields the ladle rules the World'.
So-called plain-carbon steels contain up to 1.0% manganese, residual
from deoxidation and desulphurisation processes, but it was generally
accepted that an alloy steel was one containing more than 0.1% molyb-
denum or vanadium; or 0.3% tungsten, cobalt or chromium; or 0.4%
nickel; or 2.0% manganese. The modern generation of micro-alloyed steels
(13.140) has rendered this definition obsolete—in so far as one was neces-
sary—since additions of as little as 0.0005% of some elements are now
made to influence properties effectively.
The principal objectives in adding alloying elements to steel are:
(i) to improve and extend the existing properties of plain carbon steels;
(ii) to introduce new properties not available in plain carbon steels.
13

Thus the addition of small quantities of nickel and chromium will produce
a general improvement in the basic mechanical properties of strength and
toughness, whilst larger amounts of these elements will introduce new
phenomena such as the stabilisation of austenite at ambient temperatures,
accompanied by the loss of ferromagnetism and, of course, a very high
resistance to corrosion. The alloying elements added may either simply
dissolve in the ferrite or they may combine with some of the carbon,
forming carbides, which associate with the iron carbide already present.
The decision to use alloy steels will not be taken lightly since they are
expensive materials as compared with plain carbon steels. This is to be
expected when it is realised that the unit costs of metals like nickel and
chromium are many times that of ordinary medium carbon steel. Neverthe-
less this extra cost may often be partly offset by the greater ease with
which most alloy steels can be heat-treated, making possible automatic
programming of the heat-treatment cycle with the use of relatively
unskilled labour.
The principal effects which alloying elements have on the microstructure
and properties of a steel can be classified as follows:
13.11 The Effect on the Polymorphic* Transformation Tempera-
tures The polymorphic transformation temperatures which concern us
here are those at 9100C where the a ^± y transformation occurs; and at
14000C where the y ^ 6 change takes place. That is, when BCC (a) iron
is heated above 9100C it transforms to FCC (y) iron and if heated further
to 14000C it changes again to BCC (6) iron. These transformations are
reversible on cooling. The temperatures 9100C and 14000C are designated
A3 and A4 respectively (Fig. 13.1). (The A\ temperature is at 723°C—the
'lower critical temperature'—where the austenite ^± pearlite transforma-
tion occurs in plain-carbon steels; whilst the A2 temperature is at 769°C,
the Curie point, above which pure iron ceases to be ferromagnetic. The
Curie point has no metallographic significance.)
Some elements, notably nickel, manganese, cobalt and copper, raise the
A4 temperature and lower A3 as shown in Fig. 13.1A. Therefore these
elements, when added to a carbon steel tend to stabilise austenite (y) still
further and increase the range of temperature over which austenite can
exist as a stable phase. Other elements, the most important of which
include chromium, tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, aluminium and sili-
con, have the reverse effect, in that they tend to stabilise ferrite (a) by
raising the A3 temperature and lowering the A4, as indicated in Fig. 13.1B.
Such elements restrict the field over which austenite may exist, and thus
form what is commonly called a 'gamma (y) loop'.
Many of the elements of the austenite-stabilising group have a FCC
crystal structure like that of austenite. They therefore dissolve substi-
tutionally with ease in austenite and consequently resist and retard the
transformation of austenite to ferrite. Carbon itself has the same effect on
the y —> a transformation in iron, as indicated in the iron-carbon diagram,
* The term 'allotropic' is often used to describe transformations of this type. However, 'polymorphic'
is more precise since we refer to changes in crystal structures only, in this instance.

mation temperatures at A3 and A4

because it dissolves interstitially in FCC iron but not significantly in BCC
iron. This group of elements retards the precipitation of carbides and this
also has the effect of stabilising austenite over a wider range of tem-
perature.
The ferrite-stabilising elements are principally those which, like a-iron
have a BCC crystal structure. They will therefore dissolve substitutionally
more readily in a-iron than in y-iron, thus stabilising ferrite (a) over a
wider temperature range. As shown in Fig. 13.1B, progressive increase in
one or more of the stabilising elements will cause a point to be reached,
beyond the confines of the yloop, where the y-phase cannot exist at any
temperature. Thus the addition of more than 30% chromium to a steel
containing 0.4% carbon would lead to the complete suppression of the
polymorphic transformations, and such a steel would no longer be amen-
able to normal heat-treatment (Fig. 13.10).
13.12 The Effect on the Formation and Stability of Carbides Some
alloying elements form very stable carbides when added to steel (Fig. 13.2).
This generally has a hardening effect on the steel, particularly when the
carbides formed are harder than iron carbide itself. Such elements include
chromium, tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, titanium and niobium,
often forming interstitial compounds (8.31). Some of these elements form
separate hard carbides in the microstructure, eg Cr7Cs, W2C, Mo2C and
VC, whilst double or complex carbides containing iron and one or more
other metals are also formed. In highly-alloyed tool steels these single and
complex carbides are often of the general formulae M6C; M23C6 and MC

where 'M' represents the total metal atoms. Thus M6C is represented by
Fe4W2C and Fe4Mo2C, whilst MC is represented by WC and VC.
Other elements, whilst not being particularly strong carbide formers,
nevertheless contribute towards the stability of carbides generally. Man-
ganese is such an element, its weak carbide-forming tendency being indi-
cated by its position in Fig. 13.2. However, its general effect is to increase
the stability of other carbides present.
Yet another group of elements, notably nickel, cobalt, silicon and alu-
minium, have little or no chemical affinity for carbon and in fact have a
graphitising effect on the iron carbide; that is, they tend to make it unstable
so that it breaks up, releasing free graphitic carbon. Therefore, if it is
necessary to add appreciable amounts of these elements to a steel it can
be done only when the carbon content is very low. Alternatively, if a
carbon content in the intermediate range is necessary, one or more of the
elements of the first group, namely the carbide stabilisers, must be added
to counteract the effects of the graphitising element. As an example very
few steels containing nickel as the sole alloying element are available—
most low-alloy steels contain both nickel and chromium.
13.13 The Effect on Grain Growth The rate of crystal growth is accel-
erated, particularly at high temperatures, by the presence of some
elements, notably chromium. Care must therefore be taken that steels
containing elements in this category are not overheated or, indeed, kept
for too long at a high temperature, or brittleness, which is usually associ-
ated with coarse grain, may be increased.
Fortunately, grain growth is retarded by other elements notably vana-
dium, titanium, niobium, aluminium and to a small extent, nickel. Steels
containing these elements are less sensitive to the temperature conditions
of heat-treatment. Vanadium is possibly the most potent grain-refining

element. As little as 0.1% will inhibit grain-growth by forming finely-
dispersed carbides and nitrides which, being relatively insoluble at high
temperatures, act as barriers to grain-growth. Titanium and niobium
behave in a similar manner, whilst in high-alloy tool steels the carbides of
tungsten and molybdenum reduce grain growth at the necessarily high
heat-treatment temperatures.
High-grade steels are initially deoxidised, or 'killed', with ferromangan-
ese but receive a final deoxidation, before being cast, with controlled quan-
tities of aluminium. The final product contains sufficient 'trace' aluminium
to make it inherently fine-grained.
13.14 The Displacement of the Eutectoid Point The addition of any
alloying element to carbon steel diminishes the solubility of carbon in
austenite and so results in a displacement of the eutectoid point towards
the left of the equilibrium diagram. That is, an alloy steel will be completely
pearlitic even though it contains less than 0.8% carbon (Fig. 13.3). This
explains why low-alloy steels contain less carbon than plain carbon steels
of similar characteristics and uses.
At the same time the Ai (or eutectoid) temperature is altered by
alloying. The ferrite-stabilisers (chromium, tungsten, molybdenum,
titanium, etc.) raise the eutectoid temperature in the same way that they
raise A3; whilst the austenite-stabilisers (nickel and manganese) lower the
eutectoid temperature (Fig. 13.4).
Thus the addition of 2.5% manganese to a steel containing 0.65% carbon
will give it a completely pearlitic structure in the normalised condition,
along with a reduction in the eutectoid temperature to about 7000C (Fig.
13.5). Similarly, although a high-speed steel may contain only 0.7%
carbon, its microstructure exhibits masses of free carbide due to the dis-

placement of the eutectoid point far to the left by the effects of the alloying
elements (totalling about 25%) which are present. At the same time the
eutectoid temperature in high-speed steel is raised to about 8500C.
13.15 The Retardation of the Transformation Rates We have
already seen that the TTT curves for a plain-carbon steel are displaced to
the right due to the effects produced by the addition of alloying elements
(12.45). Thus the addition of alloying elements renders the austenite -»
pearlite transformation increasingly sluggish at temperatures between

5000C and 7000C and so reduces the critical cooling rate necessary to obtain
martensite. This feature of alloying in steels has obvious advantages and all
alloying elements, with the exception of cobalt, will reduce transformation
rates.
In order to obtain a completely martensitic structure in the case of a
plain 0.8% carbon steel, we must cool it from above 723°C to room tem-
perature in approximately one second. This treatment involves a very dras-
tic quench, generally leading to distortion or cracking of the component.
By adding small amounts of suitable alloying elements such as nickel and
chromium, we reduce this critical cooling rate to such an extent that a less
drastic oil-quench is rapid enough to produce a fully martensitic structure.
Further increases in the amounts of alloying elements will so reduce the
rate of transformation that such a steel can be hardened by cooling in air.
'Air-hardening' steels have the particular advantage that comparatively
little distortion is produced during hardening. Alternatively, such a steel,
containing 4Vi % nickel and 1V4% chromium and which will air-harden in
thin sections, can be hardened completely through sections up to 0.15 m
diameter by oil-quenching. This aspect of alloying is one of the greatest
value since it makes possible uniform hardening of mass-produced
components by conveyor-belt methods operated by unskilled labour.
A minor disadvantage is that all alloying elements, except cobalt, also
lower the Ms and M/ temperatures to the extent that for many alloy steels,
Mf is well below ambient temperatures resulting in the retention of some
austenite in the quenched structure.
13.16 The Improvement in Corrosion-resistance The corrosion
resistance of steels is substantially improved by the addition of elements
such as aluminium, silicon and chromium. These elements form thin but
dense and adherent oxide films which protect the surface of the steel from
further attack. Of the elements mentioned, chromium is the most useful
when mechanical properties have to be considered. When nickel also is
added in sufficient quantities, the austenitic structure is maintained at room
temperature, so that, provided the carbon content is kept low, a completely
solid-solution type of structure prevails. This also helps in maintaining
a high corrosion-resistance limiting the possibility of electrolytic attack
(21.30).
13.17 Effects on the Mechanical Properties One of the main reasons
for alloying is to effect improvements in the mechanical properties of a
steel. These improvements are generally the results of physical changes
already referred to. For example, hardness is increased by elements which
stabilise the carbides; strength is increased by all alloying elements since
they dissolve in ferrite; and toughness is improved by elements which refine
the grain. Many formulae have been devised, by the use of which the
approximate tensile strength of an alloy steel may be estimated from its
known composition. For example, Walters takes a basic tensile strength
for pure iron of 250 N/mm2 and multiplies this by factors for each alloying
element present. The factor for each element changes as its quantity
changes. Such factors for most of the principal alloying elements are shown
in Fig. 13.6 and are true for pearlitic steels in the normalised condition.

Fig. 13.6 
Walters' factors for estimating the tensile strength of pearlitic steels in the normal-
ised condition.
They give best results for steels with carbon contents below 0.25% and
within the intermediate alloy range.
13.18 The Combined Effects of Alloying on the Microstructure In
the simplest alloy steel three components are present, ie iron, carbon and
the alloying element. Consequently this system can only be represented
completely as a ternary equilibrium diagram (9.100). The use of these
three-dimensional diagrams is inconvenient to say the least and it is gener-
ally more useful to fix one of the variables in the system. Thus we can take
a 'vertical' section from a ternary diagram at some pre-determined quantity
of the alloying element and in this way produce a 'pseudo-binary' diagram
in which % carbon and temperature are the variables (Fig. 14.1). Con-
versely we could take a 'horizontal' section from the ternary diagram at
some temperature and thus be in a position to read off the microstructural
effects of varying % carbon and % alloying element independently at that
fixed temperature.
However, we have seen that in addition to microstructural changes
associated with stabilising either austenite or ferrite and also alterations in
the position of the eutectoid point, alloying affects the rate at which the
austenite —> pear lite transformation occurs. We are generally more inter-
ested in the structure which will be produced either by normalising or
by quenching, rather than the structure formed by slow cooling under
equilibrium conditions. Consequently attempts have been made from time
to time to produce simple diagrams which will indicate the type of structure
likely to be obtained, given the composition of the steel and some specific
cooling rate to ambient temperature.
Many years ago Guillet produced some simple diagrams (Figs. 13.8B and
FACTOR
ALLOYING ELEMENT PER CENT

13.10B) which showed the general relationship between composition and
microstructure for alloy steels cooled slowly to ambient temperatures.
These diagrams were later developed to give rather fuller information of
a practical nature (Fig. 13.12). Guillet diagrams allowed for the effects of
only one alloying element to be considered and modern alloy steels contain
as many as three or more elements in addition to iron and carbon. To
represent the structures of such steels graphically the most satisfactory
method is to place the alloying elements into two groups according to
whether they stabilise austenite or ferrite and to ascribe factors to each
element according to the potency of its stabilising effect. Some years ago
Schaeffler diagrams were introduced to assist in assessing the microstruc-
tural effects of welding on the region around the weld in stainless steels.
These diagrams have been modified by a number of workers to include
steels containing elements in addition to nickel and chromium (Fig. 13.7).
It must be appreciated that these diagrams deal specifically with microstruc-
tures which are likely to be formed due to heating and cooling occurring
in the region of a weld. Nevertheless the use of such a diagram can give
an indication of how the structure of a steel is likely to be affected by
similar thermal treatment.

These coordinates are represented by point C suggesting that the struc-
ture will be mainly ferritic but that it may also contain a little martensite
when air-cooled from a high temperature.
Nickel Steels
13.20 Nickel is extensively used in alloy steels for engineering purposes,
generally in quantities up to about 5.0%. When so used, its purpose is to
increase strength and toughness. It is also used in larger amounts in stain-
less steels (13.44) and in maraging steels (13.101). Nickel is mined exten-
sively in CIS; the Pacific island of New Caledonia; Australia; Cuba and
the Philippines, but by far the major producing country is Canada from
whence Britain imports her supplies.
13.21 The addition of nickel to a plain-carbon steel tends to stabilise
the austenite phase over an increasing temperature range, by raising the
A4 temperature and depressing the A3. Thus, the addition of 25% nickel
to pure iron renders it austenitic, and so non-magnetic, even after slow

cooling to ambient temperatures. The structure obtained as a result of this
treatment can be estimated by reference to the simple Guillet diagram
(Fig. 13.8B).
13.22 Nickel does not form carbides and in fact its presence in steel
makes iron carbide less stable so that it tends to have a graphitising influ-
ence. For this reason nickel is never added to a high-carbon steel unless it is
accompanied by elements which have a strong carbide-stabilising influence.
Alloy steels containing nickel as the sole alloying element are low-carbon,
low-nickel steels. If a higher carbon content is desired, then the manganese
content is usually increased, since manganese is a carbide stabiliser.
Nickel increases the tensile strength and toughness of ferrite in low alloy
steels by simple substitutional solid solution. It also has a grain-refining
effect which makes the low-nickel, low-carbon steels very suitable for case-
hardening (19.31), since grain growth will be limited during the prolonged
period of heating in the region of 9000C.
13.23 In high-nickel steels containing small amounts of carbon, nickel
introduces considerable thermal hysteresis in the polymorphic transforma-
tion. Thus a steel containing 15% nickel will not begin to transform on
cooling until a temperature of about 2500C has been reached, when marten-
site begins to form. On re-heating the structure, however, martensite does
not begin to change to austenite until a temperature approaching 6000C.
This hysteresis, or lag, in transformation is fundamental to the use of nickel
in maraging steels (13.101).
13.24 The popularity of steels containing nickel as sole alloying
element has decreased in recent years mainly because of the graphitising
effect which nickel may have on cementite. Those which are still available
normally carry a manganese content of more than 1.0% to provide carbide
stabilisation. 3% and 5% nickel steels are still available for case-hardening

small. Invar' (36Ni; C-less than 0.1) was developed originally for accurate
measuring tapes used in land surveys. In 1920 C. E. Guillaume received
the Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition for its invention. It was also used
for pendulum rods in master clocks and similar alloys are now employed for
such diverse applications as the lining of tanks in vessels carrying 'liquid
natural gas' and in the many types of thermostat in modern heating
equipment.
Another valuable property of the high-nickel alloys is high magnetic
permeability (14.30). An alloy containing 51 Ni-49Fe has a similar coef-
ficient of expansion to that of glass making it useful in the production of
'reed switches'. In this simple device (Fig. 13.9) two 'reeds' are aligned
and then sealed in a closed glass envelope containing an inert gas. To close
the switch a magnetic field is applied from outside the tube, the reeds
operating as simple cantilever springs. The switch is used extensively in
semi-electronic telephone exchanges.

Chromium Steels
13.30 The bulk of metallic chromium produced is used in the manufacture
of alloy steels and in the electro-plating industry. The main producers
of chromium are South Africa, CIS, Albania, Turkey, Zimbabwe, the
Philippines and India. Britain's chief imports of the metal are from South
Africa and the Philippines.
13.31 It is often assumed that the addition of chromium to a steel will
automatically increase its hardness, but this can only take place when
sufficient carbon is present. The increase in hardness is due mainly to the
fact that chromium is a carbide stabiliser and forms the hard carbides Cr7C3
or O23C6 or, alternatively, double carbides with iron. All of these carbides
are harder than ordinary cementite. In low-carbon steels the addition of
chromium increases strength, with some loss in ductility, due to its forming
a solid solution in ferrite.
13.32 Chromium lowers the AA temperature and raises the A3 tempera-
ture, forming the closed y-loop already mentioned. In this way it stabilises
the a-phase at the expense of the y-phase. The latter is eliminated entirely,
as shown in Fig. 13.10 if more than 11% chromium is added to pure
iron, though with carbon steels a greater amount of chromium would be

Fig. 13.10 The effects of chromium as an alloying element, (i) The effect of carbon and
chromium additions on the yioop' j n chromium steels—the y field lies inside the relevant
'loop'; a + Y in the hatched band and a outside the loop. Thus a steel represented by a
composition to the right of the loop will not harden on quenching since it is already ferritic in
structure; (ii) the Guillet-type diagram.
necessary to have this effect. Provided that the composition of the steel
falls to the left of the y-loop, chromium will give rise to a much greater
depth of hardening, due to the retardation of the transformation rates
which it also produces.
13.33 The main disadvantage in the use of chromium as an alloying
element is its tendency to promote grain growth, with the attendant brittle-
ness that this involves. Care must therefore be taken to avoid overheating
or holding for too long at the normal heat-treatment temperature.
13.34 Low-chromium, low-carbon steels are popular for case-
hardening, whilst low-chromium, medium-carbon steels are used for axles,
connecting rods and gears. Low-chromium steels containing 1.0% carbon
are extremely hard and are useful for the manufacture of ball-bearings,
drawing dies and parts for grinding machines.
13.35 Chromium is also added in larger amounts—up to 25%—and
has a pronounced effect in improving corrosion-resistance, due to the pro-
tective layer of oxide which forms on the surface. This oxide layer is
extremely thin, and these steels take a high polish. These alloys are ferritic
and non-hardening (except by cold-work) provided that both carbon and
nitrogen are kept to very low limits. The Schaeffler diagram (Fig. 13.7)
indicates that the presence of either carbon or nitrogen will tend to produce
increasing amounts of martensite in a 13% chromium steel and so make
it brittle if cooled at a rate such as would be encountered in welding.
Consequently in modern ferritic stainless irons containing 13% chromium
the total amount of carbon and nitrogen is kept very low. Nevertheless
there is still sufficient of these 'interstitial elements' present to cause inter-
granular corrosion in the presence of strong electrolytes and the alloys are
generally 'stabilised' (20.93 and 21.71) by the addition of small quantities
of titanium and/or niobium. Best mechanical properties and formability
are obtained when these additions are at a minimum necessary to impart
corrosion resistance. The combined amount of these 'stabilisers' can be
calculated from:
CHROMIUM PER CENT
CHROMIUM PER CENT
oc
MARTENSITE
CARBIDES
MARTENSITE
PEARLITE
CARBON PER CENT

When carefully refined stainless irons contain no more than 0.01% each
of carbon and nitrogen the above formula indicates a total requirement of
titanium and niobium of no more than 0.28%.
As the Schaeffler diagram indicates, it is far easier to stabilise a ferritic
structure in those stainless irons containing 17-26% chromium and less
than 0.1% carbon.
Ferritic stainless irons are used widely in the chemical engineering indus-
tries. Lower-grade alloys are used for domestic purposes such as stainless-
steel sinks; and in food containers, refrigerator parts, beer barrels, cutlery
and table-ware. The best-known alloy in this group is 'stainless iron', con-
taining 13% chromium and usually less than 0.05% carbon. Recently
British Steel have developed a similar alloy ('Hyform 409') for the manu-
facture of corrosion-resistant motor-car exhaust systems. This contains
12% chromium which gives optimum formability whilst still retaining
adequate corrosion resistance. Nitrogen and carbon are kept to a minimum
and titanium is added as a stabiliser. Such an exhaust system would outlast
many made in the usual mild steel. It will be up to 'consumer pressure' to
back British Steel in this venture—otherwise we will continue to get the
rotten cars we deserve.
13.36 If the carbon content exceeds 0.1% the alloy is a true stainless
steel and is amenable to hardening by heat-treatment. The most common
alloy in this group contains 13% Cr-0.3% C. This is a cutlery-blade steel
which is not radically different from the composition proposed by Harry
Brearley when he introduced the first stainless steel in 1913, and improve-
ments in recent years have been entirely in the field of heat-treatment

enabling much better cutting edges to be obtained. Consequently in post-
war years these steels have been developed for razor blades, hand tools,
garden tools and food-processing equipment as well as for knife blades.
Due to displacement of the eutectoid point to the left, this 13Cr-0.3 C
steel is of approximately eutectoid composition when annealed and slowly
cooled. It has a martensitic structure when air-hardened but it is essential
that the hardening temperature is high enough (975-10400C) or undis-
solved carbides may be present after hardening, giving rise to electrolytic
corrosion. With higher carbon contents the formation of brittle carbide
networks is more likely particularly in structures which have been annealed
and then inadequately solution treated. This type of carbide precipitation
leaves the matrix locally depleted in chromium so that it becomes anodic
(21.71) to the remainder of the chromium-rich structure and electrolytic
corrosion follows.
Compositions and properties of the more important chromium steels are
given in Tables 13.2a and b.
Nickel-Chromium Steels
13.40 The addition of either nickel or chromium singly to a steel can have
some adverse effects. Whilst nickel tends to inhibit grain growth during
heat-treatment, chromium accelerates it, thus producing brittleness under
shock. Meanwhile, chromium tends to form stable carbides, making it
possible to produce high-chromium, high-carbon steels, whilst nickel has
the reverse effect in promoting graphitisation. The deleterious effects of
each element can be overcome, therefore, if we add them in conjunction
with each other. Then, the tendency of chromium to cause grain growth
is nullified by the grain-refining effect of the nickel, whilst the tendency of
nickel to favour graphitisation of the carbides is counteracted by the strong
carbide-forming tendency of the chromium.
13.41 At the same time other physical effects of each element are
additive, as for example, increase in strength due to the formation of
substitutional solid solutions in the ferrite; increase in corrosion resistance
and also the retardation of transformation rates during heat-treatment.
This latter effect is particularly useful in rendering drastic water-quenches
avoidable.
13.42 In general, the low-nickel, low-chromium steels contain rather
more than two parts of nickel to one part of chromium. Those with up to
3.5Ni and 1.5Cr are oil-hardened from 810-8500C, followed by tempering
at 150-6500C according to the properties required. Some of these steels
suffer from 'temper brittleness' when tempered in the range 250-4000C.
This is shown by low resistance to shock in impact tests. If tempered above
4000C, therefore, it is necessary to cool the steel quickly in oil through the
range in which temper-brittleness develops. The effect is minimised but
not completely eliminated by adding small amounts of molybdenum
(13.50), thus producing the range of well-known 'nickel-chrome-moly'
steels. In fact most of the steels in this group now contain molybdenum.

13.43 The nickel-chromium steels are very adaptable and useful alloys.
They forge well and also machine well in the softened condition whilst
their mechanical properties can be varied considerably by the treatment
given. When the nickel content is increased to about 4% and chromium
to about 1.5% an air-hardening steel is obtained. Such a steel is very useful
for the manufacture of complex shapes which have to be hardened, and
which would be likely to distort if water- or oil-quenching were attempted.
13.44 The high-nickel, high-chromium steels are all stainless alloys con-
taining less than 0.1% carbon which is virtually a troublesome impurity,
expensive to reduce below 0.04%. The most popular is the '18-8' stainless
steel with 18Cr-8Ni. The introduction of nickel to a ferritic 18% Cr alloy
considerably enlarges the y-loop of the phase diagram. It also decreases the
Ms temperature so that with 8% Ni the Ms temperature is below ambient
temperatures and austenite is therefore retained after slow cooling. 18-8
stainless steel takes a good polish and resists corrosion by many relatively
corrosive organic and inorganic reagents. When cold-worked these austen-
itic steels strain harden quickly and it was more than twenty years after
their introduction before they became widely used for domestic purposes.
Improved tool design and shaping methods solved many of the production
problems but even so a 12Cr-12Ni alloy is far more ductile and still suf-
ficiently corrosion resistant for use as table ware.
13.45 Chromium has a relatively high affinity for oxygen and conse-
quently oxidises very easily. Nevertheless the oxide film which forms
rapidly on the surface of chromium, though extremely thin, is also very
stable and strongly adherent to the surface which it therefore protects from
further attack. When in solid solution, either in ferrite or in austenite, it
bestows these corrosion-resisting properties upon iron particularly when
more than 12% chromium is present. Although the film is extremely thin
it builds up immediately the surface is polished.
In the presence of concentrated nitric acid, a powerful oxidising agent,
it has been shown that stainless steel begins to dissolve almost as quickly
as would mild steel but that, immediately, a thin oxide film is formed
providing a protective passive layer. As long as oxidising conditions are
present in the environment the film repairs itself should abrasion take
place, but in the presence of non-oxidising corrosive media such as concen-
trated hydrochloric acid or strong chloride solutions, corrosion may occur,
particularly in impingement attack where the oxide film is broken and
is unable to repair itself because of the absence of oxidising conditions.
Fortunately 8-10% Ni renders stainless steel more resistant to attack by
hydrochloric acid, chloride solutions and other non-oxidising media—yet
another instance where the action of nickel and chromium is complemen-
tary and indicating why 18-8 stainless steels are so widely used both in the
chemical industries and elsewhere.
13.46 The carbon content is kept as low as is economically possible
since the presence of precipitated carbides in the microstructure reduces
corrosion-resistance. Even with a carbon content below 0.1% slow cooling
of the steel to ambient temperature will cause carbide precipitation to
take place, and this considerably reduces corrosion-resistance, because the

precipitation of chromium carbide particles leads to impoverishment of the
surrounding austenite in chromium, so that electrolytic action (21.30) is
induced between the chromium-depleted region and the adjoining chro-
mium-rich regions. It is therefore necessary to heat the alloy to 10500C
and then quench it, in order to retain the carbon in solid solution. Carbide
precipitation leads to a defect usually known as 'weld-decay' in fabricated
articles (20.93). This defect may be reduced by adding small amounts of
titanium, molybdenum or niobium; elements which have a strong carbide-
forming tendency and thus 'tie up' most of the carbon as carbides at a high
temperature, so that this carbon is no longer available to form chromium
carbide during slow-cooling following a welding process. In this way any
variation in chromium content across the microstructure is avoided and
post-welding treatment is unnecessary.
13.47 High-strength Stainless Steels The development of the aero-
space industries created a demand for high-strength stainless steels and
these alloys are now finding use in many other fields. In some austenitic
stainless steels part of the nickel content has been replaced by manganese
to reduce cost, manganese like nickel stabilising austenite. These steels are
sometimes strengthened by the addition of nitrogen which, unlike carbon,
is less likely to introduce corrosion problems. Steels of this type are further
strengthened by cold-work. In the USA the 'Nitronic' austenitic steels are
in this class. 'Nitronic 33' contains 18Cr; 12Mn; 3.2Ni; 0.32N and 0.05C
and has roughly double the yield strength of a conventional 18-8 stainless
steel in the annealed form. Examination of this composition in relation to
the Schaeffler diagram (Fig. 13.7) indicates that it will remain completely
austenitic after welding and that the formation of martensite will be
unlikely. 'Nitronic 50' contains 21.2Cr; 12.5Ni; 5Mn; 2.2Mo; 0.2Nb; 0.2V;
0.3N and 0.04C. It has a high resistance to corrosion and after cold-work
attains a tensile strength of 1690 N/mm2.
Some stainless steels are precipitation hardened and may be either mar-
tensitic or austenitic in structure. Martensitic steels of this type usually
contain 17Cr; 4Ni; 4Cu and small amounts of molybdenum, aluminium or
niobium. They are solution treated at about 10000C and then air-cooled to
give a martensitic structure. Subsequent precipitation treatment at 500-
6000C results in the formation of coherent precipitates based on compounds
of nickel with molybdenum, aluminium or niobium which further
strengthen the martensitic structure. Austenitic steels of this type contain
17Cr; 10Ni and up to 0.25P. These are precipitation hardened at 7000C to
produce coherent precipitates based on carbides and phosphorus com-
pounds which will introduce lattice strain and inhibit the movement of
dislocations.
The compositions, properties and uses of some of the more important
nickel-chromium steels are given in Tables 13.3a and b.

Steels Containing Molybdenum
13.50 The USA is the dominant producer of molybdenum, much of her
output being a by-product of several copper mines; Canada, Chile, CIS
and China are other significant producers. At the end of last century practi-
cally the whole of the world production of molybdenum was used in making
the chemical reagent ammonium molybdate for the analytical determi-
nation of phosphorus in iron, steel, and fertilisers. Today the principal use
of molybdenum is in the manufacture of alloy steels.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter (13.42), one of the main uses of
molybdenum is to reduce the tendency to 'temper-brittleness' in low-
nickel, low-chromium steels. Additions of about 0.3% molybdenum are
usually sufficient in this respect, and the resultant steels retain a high
impact value, irrespective of the rate of cooling after tempering.
Among alloy steels the 'nickel-chrome-moly' steels possess the best all-
round combination of properties, particularly where high tensile strength
combined with good ductility is required in large components. These steels
are much less influenced by the mass effects of heat-treatment, the transfor-
mation rates of the nickel-chromium steels being still further reduced by
the presence of molybdenum, which therefore contributes considerably to
depth of hardening.
13.51 Molybdenum is also added to chromium steels to produce a gen-
eral improvement in machinability and mechanical properties, whilst nick-
el-molybdenum steels are very suitable for case-hardening. Molybdenum
dissolves in ferrite which it strengthens considerably and also forms a hard,
stable carbide M02C as well as double carbides such as Fe4Mo2C and
Fe2iMo2C6. Small amounts of molybdenum are very effective in reducing
the transformation rates, particularly austenite —» pearlite, ie the nose of
the TTT curve is displaced considerably to the right. Molybdenum raises
the high-temperature strength and creep resistance of high-temperature
alloys and also enhances the corrosion resistance of stainless alloys particu-
larly to chloride solutions. In modern high-speed steels (14.10) much of
the tungsten has been replaced by molybdenum. Molybdenum-bearing
steels are listed in Table 13.4.
Steels Containing Vanadium
13.60 In 1801 Del Rio found a new metal in a Mexican ore. He called it
'erythronium'—from the Greek erythros meaning 'red '—because it
formed red compounds. Later, Sefstrom discovered what he thought was
a new metal in some Swedish iron ore and named it 'vanadium' (after
the Scandinavian goddess, Vanadis) but almost immediately the eminent
chemist Wohler identified Sefstrom's vanadium as being Del Rio's
erythronium. To-day South Africa is the leading producer of the metal,
followed by the USA, CIS, Finland and Norway.
13.61 Plain vanadium steels are used only to a limited extent, but

chromium-vanadium steels containing up to 0.2% vanadium are widely
used for small and medium sections. The mechanical properties resemble
those of low nickel-chromium steels but usually show a higher yield stress
and percentage reduction in area. Chromium-vanadium steels are also
easier to forge, stamp and machine, but are more susceptible to mass
effects of heat-treatment than corresponding nickel-chromium steels of
similar section.
13.62 Like nickel, vanadium is a very important grain refiner in steels
and as little as 0.1% is effective in restricting grain growth during normal
hardening processes. Vanadium is present in the microstructure as finely
dispersed carbides and nitrides and since these do not dissolve at normal
heat-treatment temperatures, their presence acts as a barrier to grain
growth. If the steel is over-heated so that the particles of carbide and
nitride go into solution, then grain growth immediately takes place rapidly.
13.63 Vanadium has a strong carbide-stabilising tendency and forms
the carbide VC. It also stabilises martensite and bainite on heat-treatment
and increases the depth of hardening. Since it combines readily with oxygen
and nitrogen it is often used as a 'scavenger' or 'cleanser' in the final stage
of deoxidation to produce a gas-free ingot. One of the most important
effects of vanadium is that it induces resistance to softening at high tem-
peratures provided that the steel is first heat-treated to absorb some of the
vanadium carbide into solid solution. Consequently vanadium steels are
used for hot-forging dies, extrusion dies, die-casting dies and other tools
operating at elevated temperatures. Most high-speed steels (14.10) contain
vanadium, sometimes in amounts up to 5.0%. Some steels containing vana-
dium are shown in Table 13.5.
Heat-resisting Steels
13.70 Steels required for service at high temperatures are used for such
components as exhaust valves for aero-engines; racks for enamelling
stoves; conveyor chains; furnace arch and floor plates; recuperator tubes;
rotors for gas turbines; annealing boxes; pyrometer sheaths; retorts; super-
heater element supports; burner nozzles; etc. The main requirements of
such steels are:
(i) resistance to oxidation by gases in the working atmosphere;
(ii) a sufficiently high strength (creep resistance) at the working tem-
perature
(iii) freedom from structural changes at the working temperature such
as the formation of grain-boundary precipitates which would cause
embrittlement.
13.71 The surface of iron scales readily at temperatures above 7000C
and the layer of oxide produced adheres only loosely to the surface. More-
over the mobility of metallic and non-metallic ions through the oxide film
is high (21.21) and increases with temperature, resulting in continual
destructive oxidation. In a number of oxides, notably those of beryllium,

aluminium, silicon and chromium, ionic mobility is low and since these
oxides tend also to be dense they offer good protection against further
oxidation. The first three of these elements tend to have deleterious effects
on the mechanical properties of steels in the quantities necessary to impart
corrosion resistance so that chromium—sometimes assisted by small
amounts of silicon—is used. These elements form barrier films of oxide
which adheres tenaciously to the surface.
13.72 The considerable amount of chromium required to effect oxida-
tion resistance unfortunately also favours rapid grain growth. Hence nickel
is often added to counteract this as in many other steels already dealt with
here. However, nickel must be absent from those steels which are in con-
tact with atmospheres containing sulphur gases, since brittle grain boun-
dary films of nickel sulphide would be formed (21.20):
Ni-+!Ni++! +2e~
S + 2e--+!S--j
nickel sulphide
13.73 The chromium present contributes to some extent to the high-
temperature strength by ordinary substitutional solid solution. However,
creep strength is generally increased by 'stiffening' the alloy with small
amounts of tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, niobium, alu-
minium or nitrogen. Reduction in creep at high temperatures is then
achieved by dispersion hardening provided by the small particles (8.62) of
the carbides of niobium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium or titanium;
the nitrides of aluminium, titanium or niobium; and also NiAk.
Tungsten, molybdenum and cobalt also render steels resistant to temper-
ing effects at high temperatures as they do in high-speed steel (14.10), and
thus raise the limiting creep stress.
In some cases precipitation hardening can be used to strengthen the
alloy provided that at the working temperature, non-coherent precipitation
(9.92) does not occur since this would result in loss of strength and an
increase in brittleness. Generally, steels working at high temperatures are
either austenitic or austenitic/ferritic in structure so that brittle martensite
will not form each time the component cools, otherwise cracking in the
martensitic areas would be likely due to internal stress arising from non-
uniform cooling.
13.74 Short-time creep tests (5.72) are often employed in evaluating
heat-resistant alloys. Design is frequently based on the stress which will
produce a creep rate of 0.0001% per hour (1% extension in the gauge
length in 10 000 hours) at the maximum operating temperature. Safe work-
ing stresses are often based on 50% of this stress. However, such a value
can only be applied under conditions of direct axial static loading and
relatively uniform temperature. When impact loading or rapid temperature
changes are involved higher safety factors must be used, ie 33V3% or even
25% of the creep stress as derived above. The compositions and properties
of some typical heat-resisting steels are given in Table 13.6.

Manganese Steels
13.80 Although the CIS is the largest producer of manganese, South
Africa also mines considerable quantities of the metal, followed by Brazil,
Gabon, Australia, India, Mexico, China and Ghana. The bulk of Britain's
imports are from South Africa, Brazil and Ghana. Interest is currently
focused on the large deposits of ferromanganese nodules which occur in the
main basins of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans at depths between 4
and 5 km. The origin of these nodules appears to be biological as well as
chemical.
13.81 Manganese is very widely used in steel production both for deoxi-
dation and desulphurisation of the molten steel. It is generally added as
ferromanganese (80Mn; 6C; bal.Fe) or as spiegeleisen (5-20Mn; 5C;
bal.Fe) and eliminates most of the oxygen and sulphur:
FeO + Mn —» Fe 4- MnO (volatilises or joins the slag)
FeS + Mn —> Fe + MnS (insoluble in iron—so joins slag)
In order that these reactions proceed as shown an excess of manganese
must be added and the excess remains in the steel. Such amounts are
usually less than 1.0%, and it is only when the manganese content exceeds
this amount that it is regarded as a deliberate alloying element. Of recent
years, however, there has been a tendency to increase the manganese
content of ordinary carbon steels at the expense of a little carbon, thus
giving improvements in respect of ductility and Izod values, in both the
normalised and heat-treated conditions. The susceptibility of low-carbon
steels to brittle fracture is reduced by raising the manganese carbon ratio,
using up to 1.3% manganese (5.53). Similarly free-cutting steels contain
up to 1.7% manganese so that sulphur will be present as manganese sul-
phide (MnS) globules which aid machining (6.63).

13.82 Like nickel, manganese stabilises austenite by raising the A4 tem-
perature and depressing the A3 temperature; but, unlike nickel, manganese
has a very powerful stabilising effect on carbides without itself being a very
strong carbide former. It does however form stable Mn3C. Manganese also
has a considerable strengthening effect on the ferrite and also increases
the depth of hardening to a useful degree. Despite these advantageous
properties, the low-carbon, low-manganese steels are not widely used,
though manganese is used to some extent to replace nickel in low-alloy
steels.
13.83 As recorded at the beginning of this chapter, the development
of high-manganese steel in 1882 by Sir Robert Hadfield was one of the
landmarks in the history of alloy steels. Hadfield's steel contained approxi-
mately 12.5% manganese and 1.2% carbon, and, both as far as compo-
sition and heat-treatment are concerned, this is basically the same steel as
that used to-day. It is austenitic in type, though if the steel is allowed to
cool slowly to room temperature some precipitation of carbides will take
place. The steel is therefore water-quenched from 10500C in order to keep
the carbon in solution.
Being austenitic, high-manganese steel is extremely tough and shock-
resistant, and although relatively soft, it nevertheless wears extremely well.
The reason for this apparently paradoxical situation is the mechanical dis-
turbance causes the surface layers to become extremely hard so that the
resultant component has a soft, though shock-resistant core and a very
hard, wear-resistant case. Abrasion of the surface will cause the Brinell
figure to rise from 200 to 550. The reason for this phenomenon is still
uncertain. Some claim that mechanical disturbance of the austenite causes
martensite to form at the points of high stress concentration, whilst others
have suggested that the cause is simply work-hardening of the austenite.
There is little positive evidence of martensite formation and it seems most
probable that strain-hardening occurs as a result of mechanical dis-

soon as this is attempted. Despite this drawback, no really suitable substi-
tute has been found for Hadfield steel, for applications where toughness
combined with resistance to conditions of extreme abrasion are required,
eg rock-crushing machinery, dredging equipment and track-work points
and crossings. The austenitic core can be further toughened by the addition
of carbide-forming elements, such as chromium and vanadium.
Some manganese steels are shown in Table 13.7.
Steels Containing Tungsten
13.90 Up to the middle of the eighteenth century the name 'tungsten' (or
'heavy stone') implied the mineral scheelite, but in 1781 the renowned
chemist Scheele showed that scheelite contained a peculiar acid which he
called tungstic acid. Two years later metallic tungsten was isolated by J. J.
y Don Fausto d'Elhuyar. To-day tungsten is mined in many countries, the
leading producers being China, the CIS, Bolivia, South Korea, the USA,
North Korea, Thailand, Australia, Portugal and Canada. The bulk of
British imports are from Portugal. The principal ore of tungsten has always
been known as 'wolfram' but IUPAC (International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry) suggests that in future this name should be used to
describe the metal itself. However, in this edition we have decided to retain
the original name of 'tungsten'.
13.91 Tungsten dissolves in both y- and a-iron but, having a BCC
structure, tends to stabilise a (ferrite). It therefore raises the A3 tempera-
ture and, like chromium, forms a closed y-loop in the phase diagram.
Unlike chromium, however, it inhibits grain growth and therefore has a
grain-refining effect. It also reduces decarburisation during working and
heat-treatment. Both of these features are useful since high temperatures
are involved during the heat-treatment of all tungsten steels.
Tungsten has a high affinity for carbon forming the extremely hard
and very stable carbides W2C and WC and, in steel, a double carbide
Fe4W2 C. These carbides dissolve very slowly in steel when the latter is
heated, and then only at very high temperatures. Once in solution the
dissolved tungsten renders transformations extremely sluggish. Therefore,
when successfully hardened, steels containing tungsten have a great resist-
ance to tempering conditions and can be heated in the range 600-7000C
before carbides begin to precipitate and softening sets in. For this reason
tungsten is an important constituent of most high-speed steels (14.10) and
hot-working die steels in which it develops high-temperature ('red') hard-
ness following suitable heat-treatment.
13.92 Since the carbides of tungsten are so hard, tungsten is commonly
used in small amounts in other tool steels (Table 13.8). It is also used in
heat-resisting steels and alloys in which it assists in raising the creep
strength at high temperatures.

Steels Containing Cobalt
13.100 Much of the World's supply of cobalt is mined in Zaire whilst
significant amounts are produced in Morocco, Zambia and Canada.
Britain's main sources of supply are Zaire and Zambia.
Cobalt is chemically very similar to nickel and the ores of these metals
are generally associated with each other. Until recently cobalt was used
principally in permanent-magnet alloys (14.36) and in 'super' high-speed
steels (14.11). In the latter it gives a useful increase in red-hardness by
promoting extreme sluggishness in transformation.
13.101 Cobalt is an essential constituent of most 'maraging' steels
developed since the late nineteen-fifties. These are high-strength steels an
important group of which contains 18Ni; 8-12Co; 3-5Mo and small
amounts of titanium and aluminium. Carbon is present in very small
amounts.
If such a steel is solution treated at 8200C to absorb precipitated com-
pounds, uniform austenite is produced. On cooling in air, an iron-nickel
martensite is formed, but unlike ordinary tetragonal martensite (12.22)
this is of a lath-like BCC form and is much softer and tougher than ordinary
martensite. If the structure is now 'age-hardened' at 4800C for three or
more hours coherent precipitates of intermetallic compounds such as (Ti,
Al or Mo)Ni3 are formed and a high tensile strength up to 2400N/mm2 is
developed. Although the crystal structure of TiNi3 is basically hexagonal
there is a high degree of 'matching' between its (0001) planes and the (110)
crystallographic planes of the martensite matrix (Fig. 13.14). Consequently

a coherent precipitate is formed and the slight distortion produced in the
martensite lattice impedes the movement of dislocations. The term 'marag-
ing' is derived from this 'age-hardening' or 'ageing' (17.50) of martensite.
The main function of cobalt seems to be in producing more sites for the
nucleation of (Ti, Al, Mo)Ni3 precipitates. In these steels about half of the
strength is due to the original iron-nickel martensite and the other half
to the subsequent precipitation hardening. If the precipitation-treatment
temperature exceeds 5000C, 'over-ageing' results and the strength begins
to fall due to reversion of the structure to austenite.
13.102 These steels combine considerable toughness with high strength
in the heat-treated condition and in this respect are much superior to
conventional high-strength, low-alloy steels. This high strength is main-
tained up to 3500C. The wrought grades are very suitable for hot- or
cold-working by most processes, whilst weldability is excellent presenting
few problems. Heat-treatment involves few difficulties since there can be
no decarburisation and no water quenches are required. An added advan-
tage is that these steels, by virtue of composition, are very suitable for
nitriding (19.40). They are, of course not stainless steels and under
atmospheric conditions will rust at about half the rate of ordinary low-alloy
steels. Hence some surface protection is required. Nevertheless stainless
maraging steels are available and are based on chromium along with nickel,
cobalt and molybdenum.
Among the more exotic uses of these very strong—but expensive—
steels were aerospace components such as rocket-motor cases and parts for
the suspension system in the Lunar Rover Vehicle. In general engineering,
flexible drive shafts for helicopters, pressure vessels, barrels for rapid-firing
guns, extrusion rams, cold-forming dies and die-casting dies are all
examples which indicate the wide range of uses possible. Some high-
strength maraging steels are shown in Table 13.9.
Steels Containing Boron
13.110 Most readers will be familiar with the non-metal boron in the
form of the salt, borax. Pure boron, however, is a very hard grey solid
with a high melting point (23000C) and is added to some steels as ferro-
boron. Though limited use is made of boron as an alloying element in
Britain, boron steels are far more popular in the USA and Sweden.
13.111 Very small amounts—of the order of 0.0005 to 0.005%—are
effective, when added to fully-deoxidised steels, in increasing their harden-
ability by displacing the TTT curves to the right, that is, by reducing the
austenite —» ferrite + pearlite transformation rates (Fig. 13.15). The bain-
itic transformation rate may also be reduced. The reduction in transforma-
tion rates is most evident in low-carbon steels (0.2-0.4C) but with steels
in the region of the eutectoid composition the effect is negligible. A very
important feature is that, in respect of hardenability, the amounts of other
alloying elements in low-alloy steels can be reduced by as much as half,
when small quantities of boron are added, without appreciable increase in

transformation rates. In addition to reduction in cost this generally means
that cold formability and machinability are improved.
Low-carbon manganese steels containing boron are used in Britain for
the manufacture of high-tensile bolts, self-tapping screws and thread-rolled
wood screws. Small additions of nickel, chromium and molybdenum are
also made to some of these boron steels (Table 13.10).
Steels Containing Silicon
13.120 Silicon is commonly present in amounts up to 0.35% in steels for
sand castings, since it improves casting fluidity. However, in most wrought
medium-carbon and high-carbon steels silicon is limited to a maximum of
0.25% because of its graphitising effect on cementite. It has a high affinity
for oxygen and is used as a deoxidant in many steels.
The increase in high-temperature corrosion-resistance imparted by sili-
con has been mentioned (13.71) and silicon is a constituent of some heat-
resistant valve steels (Table 13.6). Silicon-iron alloys have a high magnetic
permeability but a very low hysteresis (14.38) making them particularly
suitable for transformer cores and the like.
13.121 Silicon dissolves in ferrite thus increasing its strength and hard-
ness. Since it stabilises ferrite (Fig. 13.16(i)) it raises both Ai and A3
temperatures. Low-alloy steels containing silicon as the principal addition
are relatively inexpensive, but because silicon has a graphitising effect
these steels also contain up to 1% manganese as a carbide stabiliser. Both
elements combine in strengthening the ferrite and in increasing harden-
ability, so that silicon-manganese steels respond to oil-quenching. Sub-
sequent tempering provides a good combination of strength and impact
toughness. These steels (Table 13.11) have been widely used for coil and
leaf-type springs, as well as for a variety of tools such as punches and
chisels where shock-resistance is necessary.

Steels Containing Copper
13.130 Although steels containing copper are little used in Britain they
are fairly popular in the USA. Since copper has a FCC structure it tends
to stabilise austenite when added to steel. It is sparingly soluble in ferrite

(Fig. 13.16(ii)); this solubility decreasing from 1.8% at 835°C to about
0.3% at 00C. Copper does not form carbides and in fact has a graphitising
effect. Consequently copper is added to low-carbon steels only and then
in amounts of no more than 1.5%.
In steel copper has the following effects:
(i) it improves corrosion resistance;
(ii) it produces an alloy which can be precipitation hardened enabling
an increase of some 175 N/mm2 in tensile strength to be obtained.
The steep slope of the solvus line SV (Fig. 13.16(ii) indicates that precipi-
tation hardening will be possible for a steel containing, say, 1% copper if
it is solution treated at some temperature above X and then quenched. If
the carbon content is very low martensite is not produced even if the steel
is quenched from the y-phase region. Some precipitation hardening steels
available in the USA are shown in Table 13.12.

In those steels which are not precipitation hardened a small increase in
yield strength is obtained over those steels containing no copper, though
little improvement in tensile strength is noticed.
HSLA and Other 'Micro-Alloyed' Steels
13.140 Recent decades have seen a continuous improvement in the
chemical purity of dead-mild steels. This in turn has meant that 'micro'
additions of suitable alloying elements can be effective in producing con-
siderable and reproducible improvements in mechanical properties. Pre-
viously, varying amounts of impurities would have masked and made less
predictable such improvements in properties. Increase in strength can be
achieved whilst retaining inherent ductility and toughness.
Very small amounts of vanadium, niobium, titanium and aluminium are
now used in high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels employed widely for
bodywork in the automotive industries as well as in the construction of
buildings, bridges and pipelines. The function of these alloying elements
is to combine with small amounts of carbon and nitrogen present to form
minute carbo-nitride precipitates, typically TiC, TiN and NbCN. These
precipitates severely restrict crystal growth which would otherwise take
place during necessary hot-working and annealing processes. The strength
of HSLA steels tends to increase as grain-size decreases, presumably due
to dispersion hardening (8.62) associated with these precipitates. Niobium
additions of 0.06-0.1% will develop yield strengths of 350 N/mm2 in cold-
worked annealed products whilst hot-rolled HSLA steels with yield
strengths of 550 N/mm2 are produced. A typical off-shore pipeline compo-
sition might be C 0.09; Si 0.3; Al 0.03; Mn 1.35; Nb 0.035; and V 0.07. Such
a 'steel' can be more correctly described as a 'dispersion strengthened ferrite'
alloy and is very different from an ordinary ferrite/pearlite mild steel.
Within the automotive industry developments in cold-reduced annealed
steels are not confined to high-strength products. For example autobody
pressings of difficult shapes require steel with very low strength and high
ductility not obtainable in normal mild steel. Vacuum degassed steels con-
taining very small amounts of titanium and/or niobium are known as 'inter-
stitial free' steels, since these additions combine with what would otherwise
remain as interstitially-dissolved atoms of carbon and nitrogen and instead
form separate precipitates of TiC, TiN and NbCN. Since no carbon or
nitrogen now remain in solid solution in the ferrite the product has a
very low yield stress combined with a high ductility and hence excellent
formability. These 'steels' are useful for severe pressings and are commonly
supplied as hot-dipped metallic-coated sheet (21.82). Consumer pressure
and (in the USA) legislation now demand that motor car manufacturers
give extended anticorrosion warranties of at least five or seven years.

Complex Ferrous Alloys
High-speed Steels
14.10 The development of high-speed steel had its origins in 1861 when
Robert Mushet of Sheffield was investigating the value of manganese in
the production of Bessemer steel. He made Henry Bessemer's process
viable by deoxidising the 'wild' steel with manganese, and discovered that
one composition containing rather a large amount of manganese hardened
when it was cooled in air. Analysis showed approximately 6% tungsten to
be present in addition, and this alloy subsequently found its way on to the
market under the name of air-hardening steel. It was discovered soon
afterwards that cooling from 11000C in an air blast gave better results for
tools. Some twenty years later Messrs. Maunsel White and Fredrick
Taylor, both of the Bethlehem Steel Company, replaced the manganese
in Mushet's steel by chromium, and also increased the tungsten content.
These changes in composition enabled the steel to be forged readily and
produced a superior tool steel. Production engineers will already be
familiar with the name of Taylor, who devoted a great deal of attention
to time-study and machine-shop methods.
Modern high-speed steel was first introduced to the public at the Paris
Exposition in 1900. The tools were exhibited cutting at a speed of about
0.3 m/s with their tips heated to redness. It was found later that maximum
efficiency was obtained with a chromium content of 4% and about 18%
tungsten, the carbon content having been reduced from 2.0%, in the origi-
nal Mushet steel, to between 0.6 and 0.8%. In 1906 vanadium was first
added to high-speed steel. Molybdenum was investigated as a substitute
for some of the tungsten, but increases in the price of molybdenum in the
1920s suspended this development, particularly since molybdenum steels
were regarded as being inferior in properties. Only in more recent years
has molybdenum replaced much of the tungsten in many grades of high-
speed steel. This is particularly true in the USA, the World's leading
U

producer of molybdenum, where the greatest annual tonnage of high-speed
steel is of the molybdenum type.
14.11 The main features of a high-speed steel are its great hardness in
the heat-treated condition, and its ability to resist softening at relatively
high working temperatures. Thus, high-speed steel tools can be used at
cutting speeds far in excess of those possible with ordinary steel tools, since
high-speed steel resists the tempering effect of the heat generated.
In high-speed steels ordinary cementite, Fe3C, is replaced by single or
double carbides of three different groups based on the general formulae
M6C; M23C6 and MC, where 'M' represents the total metallic atoms. Thus
M6C is represented by Fe4WiC and Fe4Mo2C, whilst M23C6 is present as
O"23C6 and MC as WC and VC. Vanadium Carbide is very abrasion-
resistant and so improves cutting efficiency with abrasive materials.
Since vanadium is also an important grain-refiner, this effect is very
useful in high-speed steels because of the very high heat-treatment tem-
peratures involved. It also increases the tendency towards air hardening
by retarding transformation rates. Vanadium tends to stabilise the 6-ferrite
phase (13.11) at high temperatures and this leads to carbide precipitation
so that high-vanadium steels may be somewhat brittle. Nevertheless vana-
dium is now added in amounts up to 5.0% to modern high-speed steels.
Up to 12.0% cobalt is also added to 'super' high-speed steels. Not being
a carbide former it goes into solid solution and raises the solidus tempera-
ture, thus allowing higher heat-treatment temperatures to be used with a
consequent increase in the solution of carbides and, hence, hardenability
and wear-resistance. Since cobalt promotes excellent red-hardness these
super-high-speed steels are useful for very heavy work at high speeds.
As mentioned above, high-speed steels containing greater proportions
of molybdenum are now widely used. Generally these alloys require
greater care during heat-treatment, being more susceptible to decarburis-
ation than the tungsten varieties. With modern heat-treatment plant, how-
ever, this is not an unsurmountable difficulty. Molybdenum high-speed
steels are considerably tougher than the corresponding tungsten types and
are widely used for drills, taps and reamers.
All of the metallic carbides mentioned above are harder than ordinary
cementite, Fe3C, but the most important feature of high-speed steel is its
ability to resist softening influences once it has been successfully hardened.
This 'red' hardness, or resistance to softening at temperatures approaching
red-heat, is due to tungsten, molybdenum, cobalt, etc being taken into
solid solution in the austenite along with carbon before the steel is
quenched. Further transformations in the resultant martensite are very
sluggish as a result of the large quantities of alloying elements in solid
solution, so that the steel can be raised to quite high temperatures before
softening sets in due to carbide precipitation.
14.12 In the cast condition the structure of a high-speed steel resembles
that of a cast iron. This cast structure is broken up by forging at tempera-
tures between 900 and 11500C, followed by reheating to about 7500C to
relieve working stresses. If required in the soft condition high-speed steel
is usually annealed by soaking for about four hours at 850-9000C, followed

by a very slow rate of cooling (10 to 200C per hour) down to 6000C, when
it can be cooled to room temperature in still air. At this stage the ferrite
present contains relatively little dissolved alloying elements. These are
present as massive carbide particles which have precipitated during
annealing.
14.13 Obviously, when we are dealing with a complex alloy containing
up to six different elements, we cannot represent the system by a simple
binary diagram (9.100). However, we can construct a two-dimensional
diagram showing the relationship between microstructure, temperature
and carbon content for a steel containing a fixed quantity of other elements
(in this case 18% tungsten, 4% chromium and 1% vanadium). Such a
diagram (Fig. 14.1) is generally called a pseudo-binary diagram and, whilst
not being a true equilibrium diagram, serves as a useful constitutional
chart.
As is shown in the pseudo-binary diagram, austenite forms when the
steel is heated to 8400C. Since the eutectoid point has been displaced so
far to the left by the influence of tungsten and other added elements this
austenite contains little more than 0.2% dissolved carbon. If the steel were
quenched from 8400C, the martensite ultimately produced would temper
easily and show little advantage over that in ordinary types of tool steel.

Fig. 14.1 A 'pseudo-binary' diagram representing the structure of 18-4-1 high-speed steel.
Here the tungsten-chromium-vanadium content is kept constant but carbon remains vari-
able. The sketches of microstructures show the effects of solution temperature upon the
extent of solubility of the complex carbides (light) in the matrix (dark) following quenching.
The higher the quenching temperature the greater the solubility of carbides (indicated by the
slope of ES).
CARBON (o/fe)

High-speed steel is therefore heated further, so that more carbide is
absorbed by the austenite in accordance with the increase in solubility of
the carbide, as indicated by the sloping phase boundary ES in Fig. 14.1.
Quenching from temperatures above 8400C will produce increasing red-
hardness with rise in temperature, due to more carbon and associated
alloying elements being taken into solution and retained in solution, thus
rendering the resultant martensite more sluggish to tempering influences.
Even when the solidus temperature is reached at S (approximately 13300C),
no more than 0.6% carbon has been absorbed and the remainder exists as
isolated globules of complex carbides (Pl. 13.2). During the heating process
most of the chromium carbide has gone into solution by the time 11000C
has been reached and at the quenching temperature of, say, 12500C, car-
bides amounting to 10% of the total remain undissolved. These are princi-
pally the double carbides Fe4W2C and Fe4Mo2C and, because vanadium
has a very strong carbide-forming tendency, practically all of the VC.
14.14 Therefore, in order to obtain the highest cutting efficiency in a
high-speed steel, it must be hardened from a temperature little short of
the solidus SD, at which fusion commences. This temperature will vary
with steels of different composition but is usually between 1170° and
13200C. Heat-treatment at such temperatures has its attendant difficulties,

The initial structure consists of saturated austenite together with some undissolved carbides.
The line C8 indicates the commencement of precipitation of primary carbides (since the steel
is not of eutectoid composition). E5 and EF indicate the start and finish of eutectoid ('pearlite')

ing will produce a mixture of martensite and retained austenite.

and requires some skill and experience in management, as well as adequate
plant. Grain growth and oxidation can be excessive at high temperatures
unless the conditions under which the steel is heated are suitably con-
trolled.
Oxidation is effectively prevented by heating the tool in a slightly car-
burising atmosphere; whilst grain growth is minimised by using a two-
chamber furnace. The tool is first pre-heated in the lower-temperature
chamber to about 8500C, and then transferred to the higher-temperature
chamber (or to a high-temperature salt bath) in which it is heated rapidly
to the hardening temperature. The time for which the tool is maintained
at the higher temperature must be strictly controlled if grain-growth and
decarburisation are to be avoided. Sections below 10 mm in thickness
should not be in the high-temperature compartment for more than four
minutes whilst sections of 50 mm should be heated for no more than ten
minutes. As soon as it has been in the high-temperature chamber for the
allotted time it is oil-quenched or cooled in an air blast according to the
composition of the steel (Table 14.1). Pre-heating reduces the time during
which the surface of the tool would otherwise be in contact with the high-
temperature conditions.
Modern trends are towards the use of vacuum furnaces for the large-scale
heat-treatment of some high-speed steels, particularly 'molybdenum 562'.
The tools are heated to 12500C in a chamber maintained at high vacuum,
the resistance-heating elements being of graphite which will not oxidise
under such conditions. When the quenching temperature is reached the
vacuum chamber is purged with high-velocity inert gas so that hardening
of the charge is achieved. Such a process has obvious advantages over
traditional methods of heat-treatment:
1) a bright, oxide-free finish is retained;
2) the tool surface suffers neither loss nor gain of carbon;
3) repeatability and uniformity of control are possible;
4) hazardous fumes and toxic wastes are absent.
14.15 Due to the sluggishness produced in the austenite —» martensite
transformation by the presence of alloying elements, the quenched high-
speed steel will contain considerable amounts of retained austenite (Fig.
14.2). It is necessary to transform this to martensite, and this can be accom-
plished by sub-zero treatment or, more generally, by tempering. Low-
temperature tempering between 300 and 4000C reduces the hardness
slightly but increases the toughness. On tempering between 400 and 6000C
the hardness increases again, often to a figure higher than the original (Fig.
14.3), though this will be accompanied by some reduction in toughness.
This phenomenon, known as 'secondary hardening', is associated with the
presence of vanadium. Secondary hardening is usually carried out by heat-
ing the tool for one-half to three hours at 550-6000C according to the
composition of the steel. Some austenite may still be present following
tempering, and for this and other reasons double tempering is now gener-
ally used. The retained austenite is 'conditioned' during the first tempering
process and some of it changes to martensite on cooling. During the second
tempering process the transformation goes still further towards completion

as more of the retained austenite changes to martensite. This second tem-
pering process also relieves internal stresses which have been set up as
austenite transformed to martensite during the first tempering process. In
the case of high-speed steel the initial quench from a high temperature
tends not to produce internal stresses, since an adequate cushion of soft
austenite is retained. The first tempering process causes much of the
retained austenite to transform to hard martensite and this may lead to the
introduction of internal micro-stresses.
The final structure of a correctly heat-treated high-speed steel will consist
of isolated globules of complex carbide, in a matrix of martensite which
contains sufficient dissolved alloying elements to render it sluggish to tem-
pering influences. The traditional type of 18-4-1 high-speed steel, when
correctly hardened, will retain a high hardness to about 5500C whilst the
more expensive cobalt steels will retain a similar hardness for a further
1000C (Fig. 14.3). Although high-speed steels are generally noted for their
use in machining operations under severe conditions, their high strength
at elevated temperatures makes them useful for hot-working tools of other
types, eg hot shears and punches for the hot-forming of nuts. The wear
of such steels can be further improved by nitriding (19.40) after normal
heat-treatment has been completed.

Cemented Carbide and Other 'Cermet' Cutting
Materials
14.20 Mention has already been made (6.50) of the production of cutting
tools by powder metallurgy, and though, strictly speaking, not ferrous
alloys, these materials will be discussed here because of their close associ-
ation with high-speed steels.
Cemented carbide tools are prepared by sintering at high temperature
and pressure, in an atmosphere of hydrogen, a mixture of tungsten carbide
HARDNESS (VPN)

powder with powdered cobalt. Sometimes tungsten carbide is replaced by
powdered carbides of other refractory metals, tantalum, molybdenum,
titanium and also by silicon carbide. In each case cobalt (or some other
tough metal) forms a ductile bonding matrix between the carbide particles.
The resultant structure resembles that of a high-speed steel, in that
spherical particles of carbide are held in a tough matrix, but whereas
the properties of a high-speed steel are developed by heat-treament, the
structures of cemented carbide materials are produced by mechanical
methods.
14.21 In other 'cermets', which are sintered products similar in prin-
ciple to the cemented carbides mentioned above, the object is to combine
the high-temperature strength and hardness of suitable metallic oxides,
nitrides or borides with sufficient ductility provided by a metallic bonding
element, thus giving a material with considerable resistance to thermal and
mechanical shock and suitable for jet-engines or other high-temperature
applications as well as for cutting tools. Typical hard-phase/ductile-bond
cermets are shown in Table 14.2.

Magnetic Properties and Materials
14.30 In the vicinity of either a magnetised material or an electrical con-
ductor carrying a current, a compass needle is acted upon by a couple

which tends to make it rotate. This couple is attributed to the presence
of a magnetic field of force surrounding the magnetised material (or the
current-carrying conductor). The strength of the magnetic field at any point
is denoted by H (Fig. 14.4). This magnetic field will give rise to magnetic
induction in any material upon which it acts and may be conveniently
produced either by a 'permanent magnet' or by a current-carrying solenoid
which, as Ampere illustrated, is equivalent to a series of magnets. The
quantity, magnetic induction, is denoted by B and is related to the applied
field strength by the equation:
B = \iH
where ^i is the magnetic permeability and is generally not constant for a
material. If the value of \i is high then a relatively smaller applied field,
//, is required to induce a given field, B, within the material.
Whilst iron is the metal generally associated with magnetism three other
transition metals—cobalt, nickel and the 'rare earth' gadolinium—are also
very strongly magnetic, ox ferromagnetic as it is termed. Nevertheless other
elements possess weak magnetic properties. Many metals are paramag-
netic, that is they are very weakly attracted by a strong magnetic field.
Consequently a paramagnetic metal like chromium when placed in a mag-
netising field carries a slightly greater magnetic flux than would a corre-
sponding vacuum. Some metals, and all non-metals, are diamagnetic, that
is they are weakly repelled by a magnetic field. Thus diamagnetic copper
would carry a slightly smaller magnetic flux than the corresponding vacuum
Fig. 14.4 The magnetic flux in a material is B = \iH, where H is the magnetic field in the
solenoid and ^i is the permeability of the material.
Fig. 14.5 The three types of magnetism.
In diamagnetic substances like copper the atoms have no resultant moment whilst in para-
magnetic substances (like chromium) there is no resultant field although the individual atoms
have magnetic moments. In ferromagnetic materials domains are re-aligned during magnet-
isation.

mixtures which exhibit ferromagnetism are useful as magnetic materials.
14.31 Ferromagnetism The relationship between an electric current
and a magnetic field was demonstrated by Ampere and it is now considered
that this magnetic field originates from the 'spin' of electrons. In a stable
atom or ion the electrons can be thought of as particles moving in orbitals
around the nucleus. At the same time each electron behaves as though it
were spinning on its own axis and it is this spin which generates the mag-
netic field.
Pauli's Exclusion Principle indicates that in a stable atom not more than
two electrons are able to occupy the same energy level. These two electrons
will possess opposite 'spins' so that in effect their fields cancel out (Fig.
14.6(i)). In a large number of a elements electrons are 'paired' in their
orbitals in this way so that such elements will be diamagnetic. Atoms of
some of the transition elements, however, have only partly-filled d sub-
shells (Table 1.4) so that unpaired electrons will be present. Consequently
in an atom more electrons will spin in one direction than in the other
(Fig.l4.6(ii)) and such an atom will have a magnetic moment. For this
reason the ferromagnetic elements and the strongly paramagnetic elements
are found in the transition groups in the Periodic Table. In the elements
iron, cobalt, nickel and gadolinium the magnetic moments are large enough
and the ions suitably spaced in the crystal structure so that when they
become magnetically aligned (during 'magnetisation') a powerful magnetic
field is produced.
Fig. 14.6 
Unfilled 'd' sub-shells as the basis for ferromagnetism.
14.32 Magnetic properties are very dependent upon atomic spacing. If
the atoms are too far apart the forces between them are too small to resist
the effects of thermal agitation in throwing spins out of alignment so that
there is no resultant field. If the atoms are very close together then inter-
atomic forces are too great to permit alignment of spins. Favourable con-
ditions appear to be obtained when the atomic radius is between about 1.5
and 2.0 times the radius of the sub-shell containing the un-paired electrons.
Thus iron, cobalt, nickel and gadolinium fulfil these requirements whilst
other transition metals such as titanium, chromium and manganese are
only just outside the range. In fact when manganese contains sufficient
interstitially-dissolved nitrogen to increase its atomic spacing by an
adequate amount it becomes ferromagnetic. Similarly the interatomic spac-
ings in some ceramic materials like BaO.6Fe2C>3 make them suitable as
ferromagnetic materials. Modern magnetic alloys contain varying pro-
unfillcd
electron
position

portions of iron, cobalt, aluminium, nickel, copper, niobium, chromium
and titanium; whilst sintered ceramics contain boron, barium, samarium
and other 'rare earths' such as neodymium. Currently magnets based on
neodymium are replacing those containing samarium because of the
greater abundance of the former and its consequent lower cost.
14.33 Within the crystal of a ferromagnetic material are small regions
known as magnetic domains. These are about 0.01 mm in width and micro-
scopic examination using a colloidal suspension of magnetite (which be-
haves like minute iron filings) shows them to be of a shape as indicated in
Fig. 14.7. Inside each domain the electron spins are aligned, but since the
alignment varies from one domain to the next the resultant fields cancel
and the material appears un-magnetised. If an external magnetic field is
applied then the energy of these domains which are aligned against the
applied field is raised so that they begin to reverse direction. In this way
the favourably oriented domains grow at the expense of the others by a
movement of boundaries which separate them. The boundary zones (called
'Bloch walls') move so that domains become similarly oriented and a
resultant field is set up (Fig. 14.8)
If this alignment is retained when the magnetising field is removed the
material is said to be magnetically hard but in many cases the magnetism
is not retained and the material is said to be magnetically soft. Whether or
not a material is magnetically hard or soft depends to a large extent on its
physical condition. Magnetic hardness generally coincides with physical
hardness, possibly because residual strains oppose randomisation of
domains once the material has been magnetised. The presence of inclusions
or holes gives rise to regions of low energy and these tend to anchor Bloch
walls. Since they are difficult to move the material is more difficult to
magnetise but, once magnetised, the magnetism is retained.
High magnetic 'coercivity' can also be promoted by using very small
needles which have a thickness less than the natural domain wall thickness
of the material. These needles are spontaneously magnetised and the direc-
tion of magnetisation cannot be changed because domain walls are absent.
Some of the modern permanent-magnet materials consist of suitably
aligned very small needles of iron which are then permanently embedded
in a plastics matrix.

When a ferromagnetic material has been magnetised to saturation
increase in temperature causes a corresponding increase in randomisation
so that the magnetism progressively decreases reaching zero at the Curie
point (769°C, 11200C and 358°C for iron, cobalt and nickel respectively)
when the material ceases to be ferromagnetic and becomes paramagnetic.
This change is reversible on cooling, ie

14.34 A permanent magnet is designed to retain a high intensity of
magnetisation for an indefinite period provided it is not subjected to
unusually high demagnetising influences. The actual magnetic strength, or
flux, in a permanent magnet is dependent upon its design and the steel or
other alloy from which it is made. The essential characteristics of perma-
nent-magnet materials are:
(a) coercive force;
(b) residual magnetism or remanence;
(c) energy product value.
Coercive force refers to the ability of the magnet to withstand demag-
netising influences. Remanence is the amount of magnetism remaining in
the magnet after the magnetising field has been switched off. The energy
product value is the quantity of magnetic energy possessed by the magnet,
and is calculated from the demagnetising curve RU (Fig. 14.10). The mag-
netising force is expressed in 4 ampere-turns per metre', whilst the SI unit
of induced flux density is the tesla (T), symbolised by H and B respectively.
14.35 We will now consider what is known as the hysteresis loop. Fig.
14.10 shows a typical hysteresis loop (PRUQST) and magnetisation curve
(OP) for a permanent magnet. When a piece of steel is placed in a solenoid
with a current passing through it, magnetic flux is induced in the steel. The
amount of this flux can be measured in webers (Wb) and the flux density
in teslas (T), where Wb = Vs and T = Wb/m2. In Fig. 14.10 magnetic flux

values (B) are plotted vertically, whilst the magnetising force values (//),
calculated from the current passing through the solenoid and the number
of turns of wire on it, are plotted horizontally.
Beginning with a small value of H and gradually increasing it, corre-
sponding values of B and H are plotted, and the curve OP produced. This
is the magnetisation curve, which is continuous until it runs almost parallel
to the horizontal axis at P. This state represents complete magnetic satu-
ration of the specimen.
If we now gradually reduce the magnetising field to zero, the correspond-
ing fall in induced magnetic flux is represented by the line PR. The inter-
cept OR represents the value of the magnetic flux remaining in the steel
when all external magnetising influence is removed. This is termed the
remanent magnetism or remanence BrGm.
To demagnetise the steel, and at the same time to measure the amount
of force required to achieve this, a current is once more passed through
the solenoid but in the reverse direction, and gradually increased. This
produces the curve RU, which is called the demagnetisation curve. The
intercept OU corresponds to the amount of force required to completely
demagnetise the steel, and is called, as already stated, the coercive force.
To complete the loop the operations outlined are carried on to negative
saturation and then repeated in the reverse sense.
The hysteresis loop, therefore, represents the lagging of magnetic flux
produced behind the magnetising force producing it. (The word 'hysteresis'
was in fact derived by Ewing from a Greek word meaning 'coming after'.)
The area of the loop is proportional to the amount of energy lost when the
specimen it represents is magnetised or demagnetised, and for permanent
magnets the area of the loop must be as large as possible.
The ultimate criterion of a permanent magnet is the maximum product
of B and H obtained from a point on the demagnetisation curve. In Fig.
14.10 it is shown that by completing the rectangle RXUO and drawing the
diagonal OX, the point Z at which the diagonal cuts the curve RU gives

an approximation to the point at which the product of YZ and WZ is a
maximum for the curve. This is called BHmdX, and corresponds to the
maximum energy the magnet can provide in a circuit external to itself.
14.36 Fully hardened carbon steels containing about 1.0 % carbon
were originally used for permanent magnets. These were later replaced by
alloy steels containing chromium and tungsten, and later cobalt. The cobalt
steels are the only ones of any practical value today and these have been
superseded by alloys of the Alni-Alnico-Alcomax series. These were
developed from magnetic aluminium-nickel alloys discovered by Japan-
ese workers in 1930.
The Alni-Alnico series have a lower remanence than cobalt steels but a
much higher coercive force. Moreover, they retain magnetism much better
under influences of shock and of heat (Fig. 14.11). The most modern alloys
of the Alcomax-Hycomax series are superior also in remanence. They are
anisotropic materials, that is they have better magnetic properties along a
preferred axis. This effect is obtained by heating the alloy to a high tem-
perature and allowing it to cool in a magnetic field. Groups of atoms
become orientated as the magnet cools and this orientation is frozen in.
It is estimated that the current usage of permanent magnets in domestic
applications averages fifty per household in the Western World. A large
number of these are permanent magnets of the rare-earth type developed
in recent years. Most of them are produced by powder-metallurgy
methods. Amongst the earliest were magnets of the samarium-cobalt
(SmCo5) type followed by alloys containing copper as well as the rare
earths and cobalt. This eventually led to the development of high-energy
magnets of the type Sm(Co-Cu-Fe.x) where x is Zr, Ti or Hf.
In more recent years commercial production of permanent magnets
based on the intermetallic compound Nd2Fe^B has begun. Such new
materials combine very high polarisation coercivity with a very high value
of Z?//max, these values being the most important indications of permanent
magnet performance.

14.37 Special mention must be made of those magnetic materials which
give a 'square' hysteresis loop of the type shown in Fig.l4.12(ii). Such
materials are used in computer memory units. Magnetic saturation to a
moderate value of B is reached quickly and a large proportion of the flux
is retained when the magnetising field is removed; thus it can be used as
a 'memory' to activate systems when called upon to do so. Even with a
small reverse field the strong flux is still available for 'read-out' and when
it is desired to 'scrub' the information this can be done cleanly, leaving the
device ready for remagnetisation. Such a material has a high remanence,
/?rem, and a small but definite coercive force, Hc. Ceramics based on Mn-
Mg-Fe oxides and Co-Fe oxides are used.
14.38 Components like transformer cores and dynamo pole pieces need
to be made from a material which is magnetically 'soft' but of high per-
meability. Permeability (\i) changes with the magnetic field, rising to a
maximum and then falling again. Since a transformer core works on alter-
nating current, the core is first magnetised, then demagnetised and then
remagnetised with reverse polarity. This type of cycle produces the closed
curve PRUQST (Fig. 14.10) and the area which it encloses is a measure
of the amount of energy wasted in overcoming remanent magnetism each
time the current is reversed (which occurs many times per second). This
energy is converted into heat, and it is therefore necessary to use materials,
for transformer cores, which give very narrow hysteresis loops, and hence,
a small 'hysteresis loss' in order to reduce energy loss and avoid over-
heating of the core. The differences in properties between a material suit-
able for a permanent magnet and one suitable for a transformer core is
indicated by the different shapes of the hysteresis loops as shown in dia-
grams (i) and (iii) in Fig. 14.12.
Soft iron and iron-silicon alloys are most useful in respect of low hyster-
esis. The iron-silicon alloys contain up to 4.5 % silicon and practically no
carbon, and are usually supplied in the form of dead-soft sheet from which
transformer-core laminations can be stamped. The use of laminations

reduces losses from eddy currents, which would be more prevalent in a
solid core.
Nickel-iron alloys are also of importance as low-hysteresis, high-
permeability alloys. 'Permalloy' contains №78 and Fe22 with carbon and
silicon kept as low as possible. 'MumetaF contains №74; Cu5; Mn up to
1; Fe-bal. Both alloys are used in communications engineering, where the
high permeability will utilise to the full the small currents involved. In
addition to being used for transformer cores, these alloys are used as
shields for submarine cables. Like the iron-silicon alloys, they are used in
the dead-soft condition, the best treatment consisting of heating to 900
0C,
followed by slow cooling, and then heating to 600
0C, followed by cooling
in air. This treatment avoids the ordered structure which would otherwise
form in these alloys. Since the magnetic properties are very sensitive to
work-hardening these alloys must always be used in the annealed state.
In all magnetically soft materials properties depend upon the ease of
domain movement and so work-hardening and the presence of impurities
must be avoided. In iron-silicon alloys the crystal orientation of the sheet
is also controlled. Since magnetisation is easiest in the <100> directions,
the sheet is prepared with the (100) planes parallel to the plane of the
sheet. This leads to a lower power loss in transformer cores.
A number of ceramic-type magnetically-soft materials are now used in
electronics and radio-communications equipment. Most of these materials
are based on the formula Fe3O4 ('magnetite' which also occurs naturally
as a magnetic mineral—the iodestone' of the ancient mariners). In this
formula the Fe
+ + ions are replaced by various mixtures of Mn
++, Zn
+ +,
Ni
++ and Cu
++ ions and are generally known as 'ferrites'. This term has
no direct connection with 'ferrite' which signifies a-iron but is a reference
to the general formula M-Fe2O4. They are powder metallurgy products.

Cast Irons and Alloy
Cast Irons
15.10 In Victorian times almost anything was likely to be made of cast
iron—street lamps, domestic fireplaces, railings, mock-gothic church
window frames and the ornamental water fountain in the local park. Sadly
many of these relics of the nineteenth century foundryman's art are no
more since most fell victim to the urgent need for steel during the Second
World War. Even as late as the author's childhood toy 'six-shooters' were
of white cast iron, whereas to-day's children play with 'space-age' guns
made of plastics materials. One important reason for the widespread use
of cast iron in Victorian times was the fact that in those days not all
pig iron produced was suitable for conversion into merchantable steel. In
particular those pig irons high in phosphorus and sulphur were suitable
only for ornamental castings which required little strength. Today cast iron
is used exclusively for engineering purposes and its technology, like that
of other alloys, continues to be developed at highly sophisticated levels.
'Spheroidal graphite' cast iron and, more recently, 'compacted graphite'
irons are of this type.
15.11 Ordinary cast iron is very similar in composition and structure
to the crude pig iron from the blast furnace. In most foundries the 'pigs'
are melted, often with the addition of low-grade steel scrap, in a cupola,
any necessary adjustments in composition being made during this melting
process. The relative scarcity and consequent high cost of metallurgical
coke has led some foundries to adopt electric melting, usually by high-
frequency induction furnaces. An obvious advantage of electric melting is
its chemical cleanliness and lack of sulphur contamination as compared
with cupola melting where the iron is in intimate contact with the burning
coke. Consequently many of the high quality grey cast irons, as well as
spheroidal-graphite irons and alloy cast irons are now melted electrically.
Because production costs of pig iron are relatively low as compared with
other alloys, and since no expensive refining process is necessary, cast iron
is a cheap metallurgical material which is particularly useful where a casting
15

requiring rigidity, resistance to wear or high compressive strength is neces-
sary. Other useful properties of cast iron include:
(i) good machinability when a suitable composition is selected;
(ii) high fluidity and the ability to make good casting impressions;
(iii) fairly low melting range (1130-12500C) as compared with steel;
(iv) the availability of high strengths when additional treatment is given
to suitable irons, eg spheroidal-graphite iron, compacted-graphite
irons or pearlitic malleable irons.
The structure and physical properties of a cast iron depend upon both
chemical composition and the rate at which it solidifies following casting.
The Effects of Composition on the Structure of
Cast Iron
15.20 Ordinary cast iron is a complex alloy containing a total of up to
10% of the elements carbon, silicon, manganese, sulphur and phosphorus;
the balance being iron. Alloy cast irons, which will be dealt with later in this
chapter, contain also varying amounts of nickel, chromium, molybdenum,
vanadium and copper.
15.21 Carbon can exist in two forms in cast iron, namely as free graph-
ite or combined with some of the iron to form iron carbide (cementite).
These two varieties are usually referred to as graphic carbon and combined
carbon respectively, and the total amount of both types in the specimen
of iron as total carbon. In ordinary engineering cast iron the form in which
carbon is present depends largely upon the cooling rate during solidification
and upon the quantity of silicon present. In alloy cast irons those elements
mentioned above will also affect the resultant structure. In fact the effects
of various elements on the microstructure of cast iron is generally the same
as in steels (13.12).
Cementite is a hard, white, brittle compound, so that irons which contain
much of it will present a white fracture when broken, and will have a low
resistance to shock. At the same time they will possess a high resistance
to wear. Such irons are called white irons. The fractured surface of a cast
iron containing graphite, however, will appear grey, and the iron will be
termed a grey iron.
Although the form of the iron-carbon diagram shown in Fig. 11.1 is of
great value to the practical metallurgist it is not a true equilibrium diagram
because in fact cementite is not an 'equilibrium phase'. Cementite is said
to be a metastable phase, that is, it has a natural tendency to decompose
forming a mixture of iron (ferrite) and carbon (graphite). In ordinary steels
this decomposition almost never occurs because in iron supersaturated with
carbon the nucleation of cementite takes place much more readily than
the nucleation of graphite. Once cementite has formed it is quite stable
and for practical purposes can be regarded as an equilibrium phase.
In a simple iron-carbon alloy containing, say, 3% carbon, solidification
would begin with the formation of primary austenite and at 1131°C a

eutectic consisting of austenite and cementite would form. However, engin-
eering cast irons contain sufficient silicon to increase the instability of
cementite to the point where graphite is precipitated from solution instead.
Therefore primary austenite will separate out first until the eutectic tem-
perature (1131°C) is reached, but at that temperature the eutectic which
forms consists of austenite and graphite. This eutectic develops from nuclei
and is in the form of approximately spherical particles known as eutectic
cells. The layers of austenite and graphite develop in roughly radial form,
both being deposited directly from the liquid phase (Fig. 15.1). In Fig.
15.1 and Plate 15. IA graphite appears to be in the form of separate flakes,
but in fact the eutectic cells are three-dimensional and roughly spherical
in shape so that the graphite layers can be regarded as something like those
shown in Fig. 15.2. That is, rather like a cluster of potato crisps growing
out from a central nucleus.
As in the case of the eutectoid point in steels (13.14) the eutectic point
in cast irons may be displaced to the left by the presence of other elements,
notably silicon. Thus, a cast iron containing less than 4.3% carbon may be

hyper-eutectic in composition and so deposit primary graphite (instead of
cementite) before the eutectic cells start to form. This primary graphite is
generally coarse and was known as 'kish'.
Rapid cooling, which produces a greater degree of undercooling,
initiates the formation of a greater number of eutectic cells and also more
frequent branching in the eutectic graphite 'leaves', giving much finer
graphite flakes. The smaller the eutectic cells, the finer the graphite flakes
and hence the better the mechanical properties.
The presence of graphite gives a softer iron which machines well because
of the effect of the graphite flakes in forming chip cracks in advance of the
edge of the cutting tool (6.61). Moreover, since graphite occupies a greater
volume in the solid structure than does carbon in solution in the liquid
iron, it tends to counteract the effects of shrinkage during solidification.
15.22 Silicon dissolves in the ferrite of a cast iron and is the element
which has the predominant effect on the relative amounts of graphite and
cementite which are present. Silicon tends to increase the instability of
cementite (13.12) so that it decomposes, producing graphite and hence,
a grey iron. The higher the silicon content, the greater the degree of
decomposition of the cementite, and the coarser the flakes of graphite
produced.
Thus, whilst silicon actually strengthens the ferrite by dissolving in it, at
the same time it produces softness by causing the cementite to break down
to graphite. When, however, silicon is present in amounts in excess of that
necessary to complete the decomposition of all the cementite, it will again
cause hardness and brittleness to increase. Both the direct and indirect
effects of silicon must therefore be considered.
The presence of silicon in a cast iron is beneficial in so far as it increases
the fluidity of the molten iron, and so improves its casting properties.
15.23 Sulphur The possible effect of the silicon present in an iron
cannot be completely estimated without some reference to the sulphur
content, since sulphur has the opposite effect, in that it tends to stabilise
cementite. Sulphur, then, inhibits graphitisation and so helps to produce

a hard, brittle, white iron. Moreover, its presence as the sulphide FeS in
cast iron will also increase the tendency to brittleness.
During the melting of cast iron in the cupola there is a tendency for
some silicon to be oxidised and lost in the slag. At the same time some
sulphur will always be absorbed from the coke in the cupola. Both of these
changes in composition tend to make the iron more 'white' as they are
opposed to the formation of graphite. The foundryman therefore makes
allowances for these changes during melting in the cupola.
15.24 Manganese The effect of sulphur is governed, in turn, by the
amount of manganese present. Manganese combines with sulphur to form
manganese sulphide, MnS, which, unlike iron(II) sulphide, is insoluble in
the molten iron and floats to the top to join the slag. The indirect effect
of manganese, therefore, is to promote graphitisation because of the re-
duction of the sulphur content which it causes. Manganese has a stabilising
effect on carbides, however, so that this offsets the effect of sulphur
reduction in promoting graphitisation. The more direct effects of mangan-
ese include the hardening of the iron, the refinement of grain and an
increase in strength.
15.25 Phosphorus is present in cast iron as the phosphide Fe3P, which
forms a eutectic with the ferrite in grey irons, and with ferrite and cementite
in white irons. These eutectics melt at about 9500C, so that high-
phosphorus irons have great fluidity. Cast irons containing 1% phosphorus
are, therefore, very suitable for the production of castings of thin section.
High phosphorus contents should be avoided in heavy sections however,
since Fe3P is brittle and lowers strength considerably. Its presence tends
to promote increased shrinkage.
Phosphorus has a negligible effect on the stability of cementite, but its
direct effect is to promote hardness and brittleness due to the large volume
of phosphide eutectic which a comparatively small amount of phosphorus
will produce. Phosphorus must therefore be kept low in castings where
shock-resistance is important.
The Effect of Rate of Cooling on the Structure
of Cast Iron
15.30 A high rate of cooling during solidification tends to favour the
formation of cementite rather than graphite. That is, the higher the rate
of cooling for any given cast-iron composition the 'whiter' and more brittle
the casting is likely to be. This effect is important in connection with the
choice of a suitable iron for the production of castings of thin section.
Supposing an iron which, when cooled slowly, had a fine grey structure
containing small eutectic cells were chosen for such a purpose. In thin
sections it would cool so rapidly that cementite would form in preference
to graphite and a thin section of completely white iron would result. Such
a section would be brittle and useless.
15.31 This effect is illustrated by casting a 'stepped bar' of iron of a
suitable composition (Fig. 15.3 and Pl. 15.2). Here, the thin sections have

Plate 15.2 Illustrating the effects of thickness of section, and hence rate of cooling on the
structure of a grey iron. The thinnest part of the section has cooled quickly enough to produce
a white iron structure, whilst the core of the thickest part has a grey iron structure. The
relationships between sectional thickness and microstructure are similar to those indicated
in Rg. 15.3 on the opposite page. Both micrographs x 300 and etched in 2% nital. Macrosec-

cooled so quickly that solidification of cementite has occurred, as indicated
by the white fracture and high Brinell values. The thicker sections, having
cooled more slowly, are graphitic and consequently softer. Due to the
chilling effect exerted by the mould, most castings have a hard white skin
on the surface. This is often noticeable when taking the first cut in a
machining operation.
In casting thin sections, then, it is necessary to choose an iron of rather
coarser grey fracture than is required in the finished casting. That is, the
iron must have a higher silicon content than that used for the production
of castings of heavy section.

The Microstructure of Cast Iron
15.40 Neglecting any patches of phosphide eutectic already mentioned,
the following structures are possible for cast irons of different compositions
and treatments:
(a) Primary Cementite and Pearlite. This structure is typical of the
hard, white, low-silicon (and possibly high-sulphur) irons and is found
also in other types of iron which have been chilled. A cementite-
austenite eutectic forms at 1131°C and as the alloy cools to 723°C the
austenite transforms to pearlite.
(b) Primary Cementite, Graphite and Pearlite. These are 'mottled'
irons of such compositions that localised small changes in either compo-
sition or cooling rate will favour the formation of either cementite or
graphite. The remaining austenite present at 723°C transforms to
pearlite.
(c) Graphite and Pearlite. This structure is typical of a high-duty grey
iron which has solidified as a graphite-austenite eutectic and in which
the austenite has then transformed to pearlite at 723°C.
(d) Graphite, Pearlite and Ferrite. This will generally be a coarser grey
iron which will be weaker and softer. The silicon content will be high.
Here the graphite-austenite eutectic has cooled slowly enough through
the eutectoid temperature (723°C) for some of the carbon which was
dissolved in the austenite to deposit on to the existing graphite flakes
leaving a matrix of ferrite. Some of the austenite has also transformed
to pearlite.
(e) Graphite and Ferrite. This variety of iron usually has a very high
silicon content. The graphite-austenite eutectic has cooled slowly enough
for the whole of the carbon dissolved in the austenite to diffuse on to
existing graphite flakes leaving a matrix entirely of ferrite. Such a cast
iron is very soft and easily machined. The ferrite present will contain
dissolved silicon and manganese.
In addition to the phases enumerated above, iron phosphide, Fe3P, as
previously mentioned, may be present in the microstructure. In white or
mottled iron it will be present as a ternary eutectic with cementite and
ferrite, whilst in coarse grey irons of the type (e) above, a binary eutectic
with ferrite will be formed. This binary eutectic contains only 10% phos-
phorus, so that an overall 1% phosphorus in the iron may produce suf-
ficient phosphide eutectic to account for 10% by volume of the resulting
structure. The embrittling effect of the phosphide eutectic network will
then be evident.
'Growth' in Cast Irons
15.50 If an engineering cast iron is heated for prolonged periods above
7000C the pearlitic cementite tends to break down to give a mixture of

ferrite and graphite. This leads to an increase in volume of the iron. Inevi-
tably some warping will follow and surface cracks will form. As hot gases
penetrate these cracks internal oxidation will occur and lead to the pro-
gressive deterioration of the casting. Cast iron moulds used for the casting
of non-ferrous ingots develop surface cracks in this way, giving a 'crazy
paving' like surface. Trouble will then arise due to dressing oil collecting
in these cracks. Fire bars in ordinary domestic grates often break up due
to the combined action of 'growth' and internal oxidation.
Certain alloy cast irons have been developed to resist 'growth' at high
temperatures. Silal is relatively cheap and contains about 5% silicon with
low carbon. This very high silicon content will favour the formation of
graphite rather than cementite during solidification so that its structure
consists entirely of ferrite and graphite, and no cementite is present which
can cause growth. Unfortunately Silal is rather brittle, so that, where the
higher cost is justified, the alloy Nicrosilal can be used with advantage.
This is an austenitic nickel-chromium cast iron (see Table 15.5).
Varieties and Uses of Ordinary Cast Iron
15.60 Foundry irons can be classified in the following groups according
to their properties and uses:
15.61 Fluid Irons which can be used where mechanical strength is of
secondary importance, and in which high fluidity is obtained by means of
high silicon (2.5-3.5%) and high phosphorus (up to 1.5%) contents. Both
silicon and phosphorus improve fluidity, and a high silicon content will
further ensure that thin sections will have a reasonably tough grey struc-
ture, since silicon prevents deep chilling. Such irons were used extensively
at one time for the manufacture of lamp-posts, fireplaces and railings, but
they have now been replaced by ceramic materials for uses such as these.
15.62 Engineering Irons must have mechanical strength and the best
type of microstructure is one with a small eutectic cell size (small graphite
flakes in a pearlite matrix). An iron of this type will possess the best
all-round mechanical properties and also good machinability. The silicon
content will depend on the thickness of section to be cast, but in general
it will not exceed 2.5% for castings of thin section, and may be as low as
1.2% for castings of heavy section.
The phosphorus content must be kept low where a shock-resistant cast-
ing is necessary, though up to 0.8% phosphorus may be present in some
cases in the interests of fluidity. Sulphur must also be kept low (below
0.1%), as it leads to segregation, hard spots and general brittleness.
Irons of this type can have hard, wear-resistant, chilled surfaces intro-
duced at various parts of the casting if desired. This is done by inserting
chilling fillets at appropriate points in the sand mould. These fillets cause
rapid cooling, and hence a layer of white iron on the surface of the casting
at these points. At the same time the core of the casting remains grey and
tough.

15.63 Heavy Castings do not require a high silicon content, as there is
little danger of chilling. Usually, silicon is no higher than 1.5%, with up
to 0.5% phosphorus for such castings as columns and large machine frames.
In castings, such as ingot moulds, which are exposed to high temperatures
a close-grained, non-phosphoric iron should be used.
High-strength Cast Irons
15.70 Over the years a number of modifications of grey cast iron were
made available to give enhanced properties. Thus 'semi steel' was made
by melting a high proportion of steel scrap along with pig iron in the
cupola, whilst Lanz Perlit iron was a fine-grained product made by casting
a low-silicon iron into heated moulds in order to retard the cooling rate.
Various 'trademarked' fine-grained irons were produced by 'inoculating'
a suitable molten iron with materials such as calcium silicide. Modern

*The values are for guidance only—chemical compositions cannot be suggested since these will depend
largely on sectional thickness of castings.

high-strength irons rely almost entirely on treatments which replace the
flake-graphite of ordinary grey iron with graphite in the form of either
spherical particles or 'compacted' flakes.
15.71 Spheroidal-graphite (SG) Cast Iron (also known as Nodular
Iron or Ductile Iron). The production of ordinary cast iron has fallen
considerably in recent years due largely to such influences as the develop-
ment of welding fabrication methods and the use of other materials like
concrete and plastics. Nevertheless the introduction of SG iron in 1946 was
without doubt the most important event during this century in the iron
trade since in SG iron the engineer finds a worthy competitor to cast steel
but often at much lower cost.
In an ordinary grey cast iron graphite is present as 'flakes' which tend
to have sharp-edged rims. Since these flakes have negligible strength they
act as wide-faced discontinuities in the structure whilst the sharp-edged
rims introduce regions of stress-concentration. In SG cast iron the graphite
flakes are replaced by spherical particles of graphite (Plate 15.4A), SO that
the metallic matrix is much less broken up, and the sharp stress raisers are
eliminated.
The formation of this spheroidal graphite is effected by adding small
amounts of cerium or magnesium to the molten iron just before casting.
Since both of these elements have strong carbide-forming tendencies, the
silicon content of the iron must be high enough (at least 2.5%) in order to
prevent the formation, by chilling, of white iron in thin sections. Mag-
nesium is the more widely used, and is usually added (as a nickel-magnes-
ium alloy) in amounts sufficient to give a residual magnesium content of
0.1% in the iron. SG cast irons produced by the magnesium process have
tensile strengths of up to 900 N/mm2 or even higher in some heat-treated
irons. The term 4SG iron' really describes a family of cast irons, which
include some alloy irons, but in all cases treatment by inoculants is

employed to produce spheroidal-graphite particles. Some patents claim the
production of SG iron using the following substances instead of cerium or
magnesium: calcium, calcium carbide, calcium fluoride, lithium, strontium,
barium and argon. In all cases high-quality raw material, as free as possible
from carbide-stabilising elements is required. BS 2789 grades SG irons
according to their mechanical properties and some of these are shown in
Table 15.3.
Those irons consisting of graphite nodules in a ferrite matrix will have
high ductility and toughness whilst those consisting of graphite nodules in
a pearlite matrix will be characterised by high strength. Some of these
irons are heat-treated to give even better mechanical properties. Thus,
sections of the American motor industry harden some of their SG iron
gears by the use of 'interrupted austempering'. This involves austenitising
the gears at 9000C for 3.5 h in a nitrogen atmosphere followed by quenching
to 235°C and holding at that temperature for 2 h. Since transformation
from austenite occurs isothermally at 235°C there is little distortion in
shape. It is claimed that SG iron hypoid ring and pinion gears are compar-
able with those of steel in terms of fatigue and also have a greater torsional
strength.
Tensile strengths of the order of 1600 N/mm2 (with an elongation of. 1%)
can be obtained by austempering SG iron at 2500C, following an initial
austenitising at 9000C; whilst higher austempering temperatures up to
4500C will yield bainitic structures of lower strengths (900-1200 N/mm2)
but elongations up to 14%. SG iron crankshafts cast to near final shape
are less expensive and some 10% lighter than equivalent forged com-
ponents. They are heat-treated in a similar way to the gears mentioned
above.
15.72 Malleable Cast Irons are irons which have been cast to shape in
the ordinary way, but in which ductility and malleability have been increased
from almost zero to a considerable amount by subsequent heat-treatment.
The names of the two original malleabilising processes, the Blackheart and
the Whiteheart, refer to the colour of a fractured section after heat-
treatment has been completed. A more recent process for the manufacture
of pearlitic malleable iron aims at the production of castings which, when

suitably treated, will have tensile strengths of up to 775 N/mm2. In all three
processes the original casting is of white iron, which will be very brittle
before heat-treatment. This white structure is achieved by keeping the
silicon content low, usually not much more than 1.0%, whilst in the
Whiteheart process some sulphur, too, is permissible, thus increasing still
further the stability of the cementite.
75.72.7. Blackheart Malleable Iron castings are manufactured from white
iron of which the following composition is typical:
Carbon 
2.5%
Silicon 
1.0%
Manganese 
0.4%
Sulphur 
0.08%
Phosphorus 
0.1%
In the original process the castings were fettled and placed in white-iron
containers along with some non-reactive material, such as gravel or cinders,
to act as a mechanical support. The lids were luted on to exclude air and
the containers loaded into an annealing furnace which was fired by coal,
gas, fuel oil or pulverised fuel. Treatment temperatures varied between
850 and 9500C and were dependent upon the desired quality of product
and the analysis of the original casting. The duration of heat-treatment
was between 50 and 170 hours, again depending upon the type of casting
and the analysis of the iron. The development of modern annealing fur-
naces in which castings need no longer be packed in an insulating material
has resulted in a reduction in heating and cooling-off times, so that mallea-
bilising can now be effected in 48 hours or less. Such furnaces are of the
continuous type in which a moving hearth carries the castings slowly
through a long furnace of small cross-section and in which a controlled
non-oxidising atmosphere is circulated.

The effect of this prolonged annealing is to cause the cementite to break
down, but instead of forming coarse graphite flakes, the carbon is precipi-
tated in the form of small 'rosettes' of 'temper carbon'. A fractured section
will thus be black, hence the term 'blackheart'. The final structure, which
consists entirely of ferrite and finely divided temper carbon, is soft, readily
machinable and almost as ductile as cast steel. Blackheart malleable cast-
ings find particular application in the automobile industries because of the
combination of castability, shock-resistance and ease of machining they
afford. Typical uses include rear-axle housings, wheel hubs, brake shoes,
pedals, levers and door hinges.
15.72.2. Whiteheart Malleable Iron castings are manufactured from white
iron of which the following composition is typical:
Carbon 
3.3%
Silicon 
0.6%
Manganese 
0.5%
Sulphur 
0.25%
Phosphorus 
0.1%
In this process the castings are heated in contact with some oxidising
material, such as haematite ore, for between 70 and 100 hours at a tempera-
ture of about 10000C.
During annealing, the carbon at the surface of the casting is oxidised by
contact with the hematite ore, and lost as carbon dioxide. This causes more
carbon to diffuse outwards from the core, and, in turn, this is lost by
oxidation. Thus, after treatment a thin section may be completely ferritic,
and on fracture present a steely white appearance; hence the name
'whiteheart'. Heavier sections will not be completely decarburised, and so,
whilst the outer layer is ferritic, this will merge into an inner zone contain-
ing some pearlite, and at the extreme core some nodules of temper carbon.
The surface layer may exhibit some oxide penetration.
Thin-sectioned components requiring high ductility are often made in
the form of whiteheart malleable castings. Examples include fittings for
gas, water, air and steam pipes; bicycle- and motorcycle-frame fittings;
parts for agricultural machinery; switchgear equipment; and parts for tex-
tile machinery.
15.72.3. Pearlitic Malleable Iron is produced from raw material similar
in composition to that of blackheart malleable iron, though in some cases
alloying elements may be used to stabilise the required pearlitic matrix in
the final structure. When an unalloyed iron is used it is first malleabilised
either fully or partially at about 9500C to cause adequate breakdown of
the primary cementite. It is then reheated to 9000C so that carbon will
dissolve in the austenite present at that temperature. Subsequent treatment
consists either of air-cooling (to produce a pearlitic matrix) or some other
form of heat treatment designed to give a bainitic or tempered-martensite
type of matrix.
If an alloyed iron is used it is often given a normal malleabilising treat-

contain more pearlite.
ment, the presence of carbide-stabilising elements causing retention of the
pearlitic matrix during this process.
The final structure will consist of rosettes of temper carbon in a matrix
of pearlite, bainite or tempered martensite according to the final heat-
treatment given. Tensile strengths in the region of 775 N/mm2 are possible
and in many respects the product can compete with cast steel, despite the
extra cost of the heat-treatment processes.
15.73 Compacted-graphite (CG) Irons These materials have their
origins in work carried out by Morrogh at BCIRA* many years ago and
are characterised by graphite structures (Pl. 15.4B)—and consequently also
physical properties—which are intermediate between those of ordinary
grey flake-graphite irons and those of SG iron. With appropriate chemical
treatment the graphite flakes produced are short and stubby and have
rounded edges. This has led to the term 'vermicular iron' being used in the
USA, though the flakes are not quite 'wormlike' as the title implies.
CG iron is produced when molten iron of near-eutectic composition is
first de-sulphurised in the ladle and then treated at 14000C with a single
alloy containing appropriate amounts of magnesium, titanium and cerium
so that the resultant iron contains Mg (0.015-0.03%), Ti (0.06-0.13%)
and Ce (a trace). The presence of magnesium tends to produce spheroidal
graphite (as it does in SG iron) and this is controlled by the restraining
tendency of titanium which makes the amount of the magnesium less
critical.
The mechanical properties are roughly intermediate between those of
grey iron and those of SG iron, whilst the resistance to scaling and 'growth'
at high temperatures are very good. Since in cast irons generally graphite

"These particular compositions, selected from B.S.3648, can be used as 'flake-graphite' irons or can be treated to give spheroidal-graphite structures. The
considerable improvement in mechanical properties obtained by the use of S.G. iron is apparent both in terms of strength and ductility.

is a better conductor of heat than is the iron matrix, it follows that CG
irons have a thermal conductivity only slightly less than grey iron but better
than nodular graphite irons. All of these factors make CG iron attractive
as a heat-resisting material and it was developed originally for the manufac-
ture of ingot moulds and vehicle brake components. In modern engineering
there are many other applications, eg gear pumps, eccentric gears, fluid
and air cylinders, discharge manifolds, etc.
15.74 The choice between ordinary grey iron, SG iron and malleable
iron for a specific application is, as with most materials problems, dictated
by both economics and technical requirements. Grey iron is, of course,
lowest in cost and also the easiest in which to produce sound castings. With
regard to the relative merits of the two high-strength competitors, SG iron
and malleable iron, the choice may be less easy. Malleable iron is the more
difficult to cast since at this stage it will have a white structure. This also
involves limitations as to cross-section as compared with SG iron. More-
over, the cost of the malleabilising process makes the product a little more
expensive than SG iron. However, it is sometimes necessary to anneal SG
iron in order to improve its machinability, and in this case malleable iron
may prove more attractive cost-wise.
Alloy Cast Irons
15.80 The microstructural effects which alloying elements have on a cast
iron are, in most cases, similar to the effects these elements have on the
structure of a steel. Alloying elements can therefore be used to improve
mechanical properties, to refine grain, to increase the hardness by stabilis-
ing cementite and forming other harder carbides; and to stabilise, when
desirable, martensitic and austenitic structures at ambient temperatures.
Improvements in resistance to atmospheric corrosion and also deterio-
ration at high temperatures are also attainable.

15.81 Nickel is a common alloying element and, as in steel, it tends
to promote graphitisation. At the same time it has a grain-refining effect,
so that whilst nickel will help to prevent chilling in thin sections, it will
also prevent coarse grain in thick sections. Nickel also reduces the tendency
of thin sections to crack.
15.82 Chromium is a strong carbide stabiliser, and so inhibits the
formation of graphite. Moreover, the carbides formed by chromium are
more stable and less likely to graphitise under the application of heat than
is iron carbide. Irons containing chromium are therefore less susceptible
to growth.
As in the low-alloy steels, the disadvantages attendant on the use of
either nickel or chromium separately are overcome by using them in con-
junction in the ratio of two to three parts of nickel to one part of chromium.
15.83 Molybdenum, when added in small amounts, dissolves in the
ferrite, but in larger amounts forms double carbides. It increases the hard-
ness of thick sections and promotes uniformity of microstructure. Impact
values are also improved by amounts in the region of 0.5% molybdenum.
15.84 Vanadium promotes heat-resistance in cast irons, in so far as
the stable carbides which it forms do not break down on heating. Strength
and hardness are increased, particularly when vanadium is used in conjunc-
tion with other alloying elements.
15.85 Copper is only sparingly soluble in iron, and has a very slight
graphitising effect. It has little influence on the mechanical properties, and
its main value is in improving the resistance to atmospheric corrosion.
15.86 Martensitic irons, which are very useful for resisting abrasion,
usually contain 4-6% nickel and about 1% chromium. Such an alloy is
Nihard, included in Table 15.5. It is martensitic in the cast state, whereas
alloys containing rather less nickel and chromium would need to be oil-
quenched in order to obtain a martensitic structure. Austenitic irons usu-
ally contain between 10 and 30% nickel and up to 5% chromium. These
are corrosion-resistant, heat-resistant, non-magnetic alloys. Some of them
are treated to produce structures containing spheroidal instead of flake
graphite. Table 15.6 indicates the degree of improvement in both strength
and ductility which arise from this additional treatment.

Copper and the
Copper-Base Alloys
16.10 Copper was undoubtedly the first useful metal to be employed by
Man. In many countries it is found in small quantities in the metallic
state and, being soft, it was readily shaped into ornaments and utensils.
Moreover, many of the ores of copper can easily be reduced to the metal,
and since these ores often contain other minerals, it is very probable that
copper alloys were produced as the direct result of smelting. It is thought
that bronze was produced in Cornwall by acc;dentally smelting ores
containing both tin- and copper-bearing minerals in the camp fires of
ancient Britons.
As a schoolboy the author was taught that the very protracted period of
Man's history when progress was extremely slow, namely the 'Stone Age',
was followed by a 'Bronze Age' when primitive technology developed
relatively quickly. It is now fairly certain that the Bronze Age was preceded
by a comparatively short Copper Age but, because copper corrodes more
quickly than bronze, few artefacts of that period have been recovered by
archaeologists. It is fairly certain that the Egyptians used copper com-
pounds for colouring glazes some 15 000 years ago and they may have been
the first to extract the metal. In Europe copper production seems to have
begun in the Balkans some 6000 years ago, and very soon metal workers
were hardening copper by the addition of small amounts of arsenic for the
manufacture of knives and spear heads. This may well have been the first
instance, in Europe at least, of the deliberate manufacture of an alloy.
16.11 At the end of the eighteenth century practically all the world's
requirement of copper was smelted in Swansea, the bulk of the ore coming
from Cornwall, Wales or Spain. Deposits of copper ore were then dis-
covered in the Americas and Australia, and subsequently imported for
smelting in Swansea. Later it was found more economical to set up smelting
plants near to the mines, and Britain ceased to be the centre of the copper
industry.

will pass the ruins of an old copper-mine, perched on the mountain side
below the Crib Goch ridge. This small mine was one of many located in
the mountainous areas of Britain, but all have long since ceased pro-
duction. Their output was insignificant compared with that of a modern
mine like that at Chuquicamata, in Chile. Nevertheless supplies of the
higher grades of copper ore are diminishing and the demand for yet higher
outputs has meant that low-grade, less economical sources have to be
worked. Until a couple of decades ago the world tonnage of copper pro-
duced annually was second only to that of iron but now copper ranks third,
having been overtaken by aluminium.
Although the USA is still the largest producer of copper, as of many
other metals, her output is being closely approached by those of the CIS
and Chile. Canada, Zambia, Zaire and Peru are also leading producers,
whilst in Europe the outputs of Poland and Yugoslavia are significant. The
bulk of Britain's supply of copper comes from Zambia and Canada.
Properties and Uses of Copper
16.20 A very large part of the world's production of metallic copper is
used in the unalloyed form, mainly in the electrical industries. Copper has
a very high specific conductivity, and is, in this respect, second only to
silver, to which it is but little inferior. When relative costs are considered,
copper is naturally the metal used for industrial purposes demanding high
electrical conductivity.
16.21 The Electrical Conductivity of Copper The International
Annealed Copper Standard (IACS) was adopted by the International Elec-
trochemical Commission as long ago as 1913, and specified that an
annealed copper wire 1 m long and of cross-section 1 mm2 should have a
resistance of no more than 0.017241 ohms at 200C. Such a wire would be
said to have a conductivity of 100%. Since the standard was adopted in
1913 higher purity copper is now commonly produced and this explains
the anomalous situation where electrical conductivities of up to 101.5%
are frequently quoted.
As indicated in Fig. 16.1, the presence of impurities reduces electrical
conductivity. To a lesser degree, cold-work has the same effect. Reduction
in conductivity caused by the presence of some elements in small amounts
is not great, so that up to 1% cadmium, for example, is added to telephone
wires in order to strengthen them. Such an alloy, when hard-drawn, has a
tensile strength of some 460 N/mm2 as compared with 340 N/mm2 for
hard-drawn, pure copper, whilst the electrical conductivity is still over 90%
of that for soft pure copper. Other elements have pronounced effects
on conductivity; as little as 0.04% phosphorus will reduce the electrical
conductivity to about 75% of that for pure copper.
16.22 The Commercial Grades of Copper include both furnace-
refined and electrolytically refined metal. High-conductivity copper (usu-
ally referred to as OFHC or oxygen-free high conductivity) is of the highest
purity, and contains at least 99.9% copper. It is used where the highest

electrical and thermal conductivities are required, and is copper which has
been refined electrolytically.
Fire-refined grades of copper can be either tough pitch or deoxidised
according to their subsequent application. The former contains small
amounts of oxygen (present as copper (I) oxide, O12O) absorbed during
the manufacturing process. It is usually present in amounts of the order
of 0.04-0.05% oxygen (equivalent to 0.45-0.55% copper(I)oxide). This
copper(I) oxide is present as tiny sky-blue globules which were originally
part of a CU/O12O eutectic. Hot-working of the copper ingots breaks down
the Cu2O layers of this eutectic into globules. These globules have a neglig-
ible effect as far as electrical conductivity, and most other properties, are
concerned. The presence of copper(I) oxide is, in fact often advantageous,
since harmful impurities, like bismuth, appear to collect as oxides associ-
ated with the copper (I) oxide globules, instead of occurring as brittle inter-
crystalline films, as they would otherwise do.
For processes such as welding and tube-making, however, the existence
of these globules is extremely deleterious, since reducing atmospheres con-
taining hydrogen cause gassing of the metal. Hydrogen is interstitially
soluble in solid copper so that it comes into contact with subcutaneous
globules of copper(I) oxide, reducing them thus:
CU2O H- H2 ^ 2Cu + H2O
Equilibrium proceeds to the right according to the Law of Mass Action
because the concentration of dissolved hydrogen is high relative to that of
copper (I) oxide. The water formed is present as steam at the temperature
of the reaction. Since steam is virtually insoluble in solid copper it is
precipitated at the crystal boundaries, thus, in effect, pushing the crystals
apart and reducing the ductility by as much as 85% and the tensile strength
by 30-40%. Under the microscope gassed tough-pitch copper is recognised
by the thick grain boundaries, which are really minute fissures, and by the
absence of copper(I) oxide globules.
For such purposes as welding, therefore, copper is deoxidised before
being cast by the addition of phosphorus, which acts in the same way as
the manganese used in deoxidising steels. A small excess of phosphorus,
of the order of 0.04%, dissolves in the copper after deoxidation, and this
small amount is sufficient to reduce the electrical conductivity by as much
as 25%. So, whilst copper which is destined for welding or thermal treat-
ment in hydrogen-rich atmospheres should be of this type, copper deoxi-
dised by phosphorus would be unsuitable for electrical purposes, where
either electrolytic copper or good-quality tough-pitch copper must be used.
16.23 Mention was made (16.10) of the use of arsenic in hardening
copper by Balkans metal workers some 6000 years ago. In more recent
times up to 0.5% arsenic was added to much of the copper used in the
construction of locomotives. This addition considerably increased the
strength at elevated temperatures by raising the softening temperature
from about 1900C for the pure metal to 5500C for arsenical copper. This
made arsenical copper useful in the manufacture of steam locomotive fire-

boxes, boiler tubes and rivets, since the alloy, whilst being stronger at high
temperatures still had a high thermal conductivity.
The addition of 0.5% lead or tellurium imparts free-cutting properties
to copper (6.64) and provides a material which can be machined to close
tolerances whilst still retaining 95% of the conductivity of pure copper.
16.24 Although copper has only a moderate tensile strength (16.21) it
is a metal with very high malleability and ductility. It is very suitable for
both hot- and cold-working by the main processes. Mention has been made
of 'deformation twins' (4.18) but another type of twinning occurs when
certain of the FCC metals—particularly copper and its alloys and austenitic
steels—are annealed following cold-work. The presence of these annealing
twins is indicated by what appear to be pairs of parallel straight lines
crossing individual crystals (Plates 16.1c and 16.3c). Like deformation
twins, these regions represent a part of the crystal in which a change in
direction of the crystal lattice occurs and in this instance are formed during
re-crystallisation. The growth of annealing twins is related to the amount
of internal energy associated with the formation of dislocation faults within
the crystals during previous Cold-work. In aluminium and its alloys this
form of internal energy is high so that new crystal boundaries tend to form
whereas in copper alloys this energy is low and twinning occurs instead.
Thus copper and its alloys show twinned crystals in the cold-worked/
annealed state whilst aluminium alloys do not.

have already been mentioned. Quite small amounts of some impurities will
also cause serious reductions in the mechanical properties.
Bismuth is possibly the worst offender, and even as little as 0.002% will
sometimes cause trouble, since bismuth is insoluble in amounts in excess
of this figure, and, like iron(II) sulphide in steel, collects as brittle films at
the crystal boundaries, Antimony produces similar effects and, in particu-
lar, impairs the cold-working properties.
Selenium and tellurium make welding difficult, in addition to reducing
the conductivity and cold-working properties; whilst lead causes hot-
shortness, since it is insoluble in copper and is actually molten at the
hot-working temperatures.
The Copper-base Alloys
The ever-present demand by the electrical industries for the World's dimin-
ishing resources of copper has led industry to look for cheaper materials
to replace the now expensive copper alloys. Whilst the metallurgist has
been perfecting a more ductile mild steel, the engineer has been developing
more efficient methods of forming metals so that copper alloys are now
only used where high electrical conductivity or suitable formability coupled
with good corrosion resistance are required. The copper-base alloys
include brasses and bronzes, the latter being copper-rich alloys containing
either tin, aluminium, silicon or beryllium; though the tin bronzes are
possibly the best known.
The Brasses
16.30 The brasses comprise the useful alloys of copper and zinc contain-
ing up to 45% zinc, and constitute one of the most important groups of
non-ferrous engineering alloys.
As shown by the constitutional diagram (Fig. 16.2), copper will dissolve
up to 32.5% zinc at the solidus temperature of 9020C, the proportion
increasing to 39.0% at 454°C. With extremely slow rates of cooling, which
allow the alloy to reach structural equilibrium, the solubility of zinc in
copper will again decrease to 35.2% at 2500C. Diffusion is very sluggish,
however, at temperatures below 4500C, and with ordinary industrial rates
of cooling the amount of zinc which can remain in solid solution in copper
at room temperature is about 39%. The solid solution so formed is rep-
resented by the symbol a. Since this solid solution is of the disordered
type, it is prone to the phenomenon of coring, though this is not extensive,
indicated by the narrow range between liquidus and solidus.
If the amount of zinc is increased beyond 39% an intermediate phase,
P', equivalent to CuZn, will appear in the microstructure of the slowly-
cooled brass. This phase is hard, but quite tough at room temperature and
plastic when it changes to the modification (3 above 454°C. Unlike copper,
which is FCC and zinc, which is CPH, (3' has a structure which is often

loosely described as BCC. However this is not strictly correct since the
term 'body-centred cubic' implies a structure in which all atoms are similar.
The structure of |3' is in fact of the 'caesium chloride' type in which two
interlacing simple cubic lattices are involved (Fig. 16.3). Each atom occu-
pying a 'body-centred position' is surrounded by four atoms of the other
metal. Since the copper and zinc atoms occupy fixed positions in the lattice,

Atom 'Y' occupies a body-centred position in cube 'A', whilst atom 1Z occupies a body-
centred position in cube 'B'. This is in fact the 'caesium chloride' type of structure and not
really BCC as it first appears.
P' crystals are not cored. Recent research suggests that if the P' phase is
allowed to cool extremely slowly it undergoes a eutectoid transformation
at about 2400C to produce an a + y structure. However when a brass
containing P' is cooled at ordinary industrial rates this transformation never
occurs and P', which can contain between 48 and 50% copper, persists at
ambient temperatures. For this reason we have omitted the (3' —» a + y
transformation from the constitutional diagram (Fig. 16.2). Further in-
creases in the zinc content beyond 50% cause the appearance of the phase
Y in the structure. This is very brittle, rendering alloys which contain it
unfit for engineering purposes.
Due to coring effects, an alloy which is nominally a-phase in structure
may contain some (3' particles at the boundaries of the cored a-crystals
when in the as-cast condition. This coring will depend upon the rate of
cooling and the nearness of the composition of the alloy to the a/a + (3'
phase boundary. Such P'-phase will usually be absorbed fairly quickly
during hot working. A Widmanstatten structure (11.53) is formed in cast
a + p' alloys as the temperature falls, due to the manner in which the
needle-like crystals of a precipitate within the P crystals as the alloy cools
from out of the P-phase area.
16.31 As mentioned above, the a-phase is quite soft and ductile at
room temperatures, and for this reason the completely a-phase brasses
are excellent cold-working alloys. The presence of the P'-phase, however,
makes them rather hard and with a low capacity for cold-work; but since
the p-phase is plastic at red heat, the a 4- P' brasses are best shaped by
hot-working processes, such as forging or extrusion. The a-phase tends
to be rather hot-short within the region of 30% zinc and between the
temperatures of 300 and 7500C, and is therefore much less suitable as a
hot-working alloy unless temperatures and working conditions are strictly
controlled. The a-phase would also introduce difficulties during the
extrusion of the a + P' alloys were it not for the fact that it is absorbed

into the (3-phase when the 60-40 composition (one of the most popular
alloys of this group) is heated to a point above the a + (3/(3 phase boundary
in the region of 7500C, thus producing a uniform plastic structure of
(3-phase only. The a-phase is usually in process of being precipitated whilst
hot-working is taking place, so that, instead of the Widmanstatten structure
being formed again as the temperature falls, it is replaced by a refined
granular a + |3' structure which possesses superior mechanical properties
to those of the directional Widmanstatten structure. The needle-shaped
crystals of the a-phase are prevented from forming by the mechanical
disturbances which accompany the working process.
Thus the brasses can conveniently be classified according to whether
they are hot-working or cold-working alloys.
16.32 The Cold-working (/-brasses 
These are generally completely
a-phase in structure, though a limited amount of cold-work may also be
applied to those a + |3' alloys which contain only small amounts of the
P'-phase. The a + (3' alloys proper are, however, shaped by hot-working
processes in the initial stages, and such cold-work as is applied is merely
for finishing to size or to produce the correct degree of work-hardening
for subsequent use.
The a-brasses are useful mainly because of their high ductility, which
reaches a maximum at 30% zinc, as shown in Fig. 16.2. Such alloys need
to be of very high purity, since the inclusion of even small amounts of
impurity will lead to a big loss in ductility. The need to use high-purity
copper and zinc in the manufacture of 70-30 brass makes it a very ex-
pensive alloy. For this reason it has been replaced in many instances in
engineering design by BOP mild steel which has a high ductility because
of its low nitrogen content. The a-brasses are also rather sensitive to
annealing temperatures and, since grain growth is rapid at elevated tem-
peratures, it is easy to burn the alloy. (This trade term should not be
confused with oxidation of the metal. It is widely used industrially to signify
overheating.) a-Brasses should be annealed at about 6000C. If overheated
to 7500C, grain growth is so rapid that on subsequent pressing an orange
peel effect is apparent on the surface. This is due to coarse grain being
large enough to be visible on the surface.
16.33 Cold-worked a-brasses are subject to 'season cracking'. Dislo-
cations become piled-up at crystal boundaries as a result of cold-work,
making these regions zones of high energy. Therefore, any corrosion which
takes place tends to be intercrystalline since the high-energy zones are
'anodic' (21.40) to their surroundings. As a result of corrosion the grain
boundaries become weakened and fracture occurs there because of the
locked-up stresses which are present. The term 'season-cracking' was origi-
nally used to describe the spontaneous cracking found in stored cartridge
cases in India during the monsoon season. It was particularly prevalent
when the damp atmosphere contained ammonia emanating from nearby
cavalry stables. Season cracking can be avoided by giving the components
a low-temperature, stress relief anneal at about 2500C after fabrication.
16.34 Other elements may be added in small amounts to the a-brasses
in order to improve either corrosion-resistance or mechanical properties.

Clock Brass. Used for the plates and wheels in clock and
instrument manufacture. Lead imparts free-cutting
properties.
Free-cutting Brass. Most suitable material for high-speed
machining, but can be only slightly deformed by bending,
etc. A 61 % Cu alloy has greater impact strength.
Admiralty Brass. A standard composition for condenser
tubes. Tin gives improved corrosion resistance over plain
70-30 brass. Arsenic inhibits dezincification.
Naval Brass. For structural applications and forgings. Tin
reduces corrosion, especially in sea-water.
Aluminium Brass. Possesses excellent
corrosion-resistance, and is a popular alloy for condenser
tubes.
High-tensile Brass. Stronger than plain brasses of similar
copper content.
Dezincification-resistant Brass. Water fittings for use where
the water supply dezincifies plain a + p brasses. After hot
stamping the alloy is annealed at 525°C and water
quenched to achieve dezincification resistance.

Tin is added in amounts up to 1.0% in order to improve corrosion-
resistance, particularly in naval brass and Admiralty brass for condenser
tubes. Such small quantities of tin are retained in solid solution. Alterna-
tively, small amounts of arsenic (0.01-0.05%) may be added to 70-30
brass destined for the manufacture of condenser tubes, as it is said to
improve corrosion-resistance and inhibit dezincification. Lead, in amounts
of the order of 2.0%, is added to improve machinability. It is insoluble
in brass, and exists as small globules, which cause local fractures during
machining (6.66). Aluminium is sometimes added, in amounts up to 2.0%,
to brass for the manufacture of naval condenser tubes, since it imparts
excellent corrosion-resistance, particularly to impingement' attack. Nickel
is retained in solid solution, and small amounts may be added to brass to
improve corrosion-resistance. The now obsolete twelve-sided threepenny
pieces were made from a brass containing 20% zinc, 1% nickel and the
balance copper.
16.35 The Hot-working a + |3' brasses Whilst the a-brasses are
specifically cold-working alloys they are generally hot-worked in the
'breaking-down' stages; but a + (3' alloys, containing not more than 60%
copper are shaped almost entirely by hot work.
The only important 'straight' brass in this group is 60-40 brass, formerly
known as 'Muntz metal'. As already mentioned, the a-phase is entirely
absorbed into the (3-phase when the alloy is heated to about 7500C, so that
the best hot-working temperature range is while cooling between 750 and
6500C, during which range the a-phase is being deposited. The mechanical-
working process breaks down the a-phase into small particles as it is
deposited, and prevents the reintroduction of the coarse Widmanstatten
structure.
16.36 Free-cutting Brasses of the 60-40 type contain about 2.0%
lead, whilst a similar alloy of higher purity is used extensively for hot-
forging where a machining operation is to follow. Up to 0.15% arsenic
may be added to those brasses destined for the manufacture of water
fittings as it is known to improve corrosion-resistance and inhibit dezincifi-
cation.
16.37 High-tensile Brasses are misleadingly called Manganese
Bronze, possibly because the manganese they often contain produces an
oxidised-bronze effect on the surface of extruded rod. These brasses con-
tain 54-62% copper, up to 7.0% other elements and the balance zinc. In
addition to being hot-working alloys, they are also used in the cast form
for such applications as marine propellers, water-turbine runners, rudders,
gun mountings and sights, and locomotive axle boxes. The wrought sec-
tions are used for pump rods, and for stampings and pressings for auto-
mobile fittings and switch gear. The tensile strength is increased, by the
addition of these other elements, to as much as 700 N/mm2 in the chill-cast
or forged condition. The additions usually in amounts up to 2.0% each,
include manganese, iron and aluminium; whilst up to 1.0% tin may also
be included to improve corrosion-resistance.
Details of some of the more important wrought brasses are given in
Table 16.1.

The Tin Bronzes
16.40 Bronzes containing approximately 10% tin were probably the first
alloys to be used by Man. In Britain bronze articles almost four thousand
years old have been found, and during the Roman occupation of Britain
the copper-mines of Cumberland and Wales were in a state of rapidly
increasing production. Centuries before the Roman invasion, however,
Phoenician traders from Tyre and Sidon brought their ships to Cornwall
in search of tin.
One of the significant factors in the early Roman conquests was
undoubtedly the bronze sword, and it is thought that in even earlier times
metal-workers realised that a high tin content, in the region of 10%, pro-
duced a hard bronze whilst less tin gave a softer alloy. The relatively high
cost of copper—and particularly tin—coupled with competition from other
new and improved materials has led to a decline in the wide use of bronzes
in the modern world.
16.41 The relationship between the equilibrium diagram and the actual
microstructure produced for a given alloy is rather more complex in the
case of tin bronzes than with the brasses. The rate of diffusion of copper
and tin into each other is much lower than it is with copper and zinc. This
is indicated by the wide range of composition at any temperature, between
the liquidus AL and the solidus AS (Fig. 16.4), and leading to a high
°c

degree of coring during the actual solidification process. Moreover, struc-
tural changes below approximately 4000C take place in copper-tin alloys
with extreme sluggishness. Both of these factors mean that a cast bronze,
cooled to ambient temperature under normal industrial conditions, will
rarely exhibit the structure indicated by the equilibrium diagram.
In short, whilst the peritectic reaction (a —»(3) at 789°C and the eutectoid
transformations (|3 -» a + y) at 586°C and (y -> a + 6) at 5200C will take
place as indicated by the diagram during ordinary rates of cooling, the
eutectoid transformation (6 —> a + e) at 3500C would occur only under
conditions of extremely slow cooling, such as would never be encountered
industrially. Hence the phase 8 (Cu3Sn) is never seen in the structure of a
cast bronze containing more than 11.0% tin. Further, due to the slow rate
of diffusion of copper and tin atoms below 3500C, the precipitation of 8
from a in alloys containing less than 11.0% tin, in accordance with the
phase boundary XY, will not occur. For practical purposes the reader can
therefore ignore that part of the equilibrium diagram below 4000C and
assume that whatever structure has been attained at 4000C will persist to
room temperature under normal industrial rates of cooling.
16.42 As with brasses, the a-phase, being a solid solution, is tough and
ductile, so that a-phase alloys can be cold-worked successfully. The
6-phase, however, is an intermetallic compound of composition equivalent
to Cu3iSn8, and is a hard, brittle, blue substance, whose presence renders
the a + 5 bronzes rather brittle. The 6-phase must, therefore, be absent
from alloys destined for any degree of cold-work.
Due to heavy coring arising from slow rates of diffusion, cast alloys with
as little as 6.0% tin will show particles of 6 at the boundaries of the cored
a crystals. The skeletons of the a-phase crystals will be much richer in
copper than the nominal 94%, thus making the outer fringes correspond-
ingly richer in tin to such an extent that the 6-phase is formed. In order to
make such an alloy amenable for cold-work, the 6-phase can be absorbed
by prolonged annealing (say six hours at 7000C), which will promote dif-
fusion so that equilibrium is attained in accordance with the equilibrium
diagram and a uniform a-phase structure produced. Subsequent air-cooling
—or even furnace-cooling at the usual industrial rates—will be too rapid
to permit precipitation of any of the s-phase when the phase boundary
XY is reached; and so the uniform a structure will be retained at room
temperature. By using such initial heat-treatment to produce a uniform a
structure it is possible to cold-work bronzes containing as much as 14%
tin, though in general industrial practice only alloys with up to 7% tin are
produced in wrought form.
The tin bronzes can be classified as follows:
16.43 Plain Tin Bronzes These comprise both wrought and cast
alloys, the former usually containing up to 7% tin and the latter as much
as 18% tin. The wrought alloys contain none of the 6-phase, the absence
of which makes them amenable to shaping by cold-working operations.
These alloys are usually supplied as rolled sheet, drawn rod or drawn
turbine blading.
The cast alloys are used mainly for bearings, since the structure fulfils

the requirements for that duty, namely, hard particles of the S-phase,
which will resist wear, embedded in a matrix of the a-phase, which will
resist shock.
16.44 Phosphor-bronzes Most of the tin bronzes mentioned above
contain small amounts of phosphorus (up to 0.05%) residual from deoxi-
dation which is carried out before casting. They are often incorrectly called
phosphor-bronzes. True phosphor-bronze contains phosphorus as a delib-
erate alloying addition, generally present in amounts between 0.1 and
1.0%.
Wrought phosphor-bronzes contain up to 8.0% tin and up to 0.3% phos-
phorus, and, like the plain tin bronzes, are supplied in the form of rod,
wire and turbine blading. The phosphorus not only increases the tensile
strength but also, it is claimed, improves the corrosion-resistance.
Cast phosphor-bronzes contain up to 13.0% tin and up to 1.0% phos-
phorus, and are used mainly for bearings and other components where a
low friction coefficient is desirable, coupled with high strength and tough-
ness. The phosphorus is usually present in these alloys as copper phos-
phide, C113P, a hard compound which forms a ternary eutectoid with the
a- and 6-phases.
16.45 Bronzes Containing Zinc These, again, comprise both wrought
and cast alloys. The wrought alloys are used chiefly for the manufacture
of coinage and contain up to 3.0% tin and up to 2.5% zinc. In recent years
the tin content of British 'copper' coinage has been reduced from the
pre-war figure of 3.0% to as low as 0.5%. This began as a war-time measure
when the Japanese occupation of Malaya cut off our main supplies of tin;
and has continued since because of the high prices which have prevailed
for the metal. The replacement of tin by some zinc cheapens the alloy,
zinc being only about a tenth the price of tin. A subsidiary function of zinc
is that, like phosphorus, it acts as a deoxidiser and forms zinc oxide, ZnO,
which floats to the top of the melt. The wrought bronzes containing zinc
are all a-phase alloys with similar structures to those of straight tin bronzes
of like compositions.
The best known of the cast alloys is 'Admiralty gunmetal', or 88-10-2
gunmetal, containing 10% tin and 2% zinc. It is no longer used in naval
ordnance, but is still widely employed where a strong, corrosion-resistant
casting is required. Its structure is similar to that of a straight tin bronze
containing 11% tin, so that, due to considerable coring, a lot of a + 5
eutectoid will be present. The zinc not only cheapens the alloy and acts as
a deoxidiser but also improves casting fluidity.
16.46 Bronzes Containing Lead Up to 2.0% lead is sometimes added
to bronzes as well as to brasses in order to improve machinability. Larger
amounts are added for some special bearings; and such bronzes permit 20%
higher loading than do lead-base or tin-base white metals. The thermal
conductivity of these bronzes is also higher, so that they can be used at
higher speeds, since heat is dissipated more quickly. With normal lubrica-
tion they have excellent wear resistance but, equally important, the seizure
resistance is high since lead will function temporarily as a lubricant should
normal lubrication fail. Leaded bearing bronzes contain up to 20% lead

Characteristics and uses
Coinage Bronze. Used for British 'copper' coinage.
Low-tin Bronze. Used where good elastic properties
combined with resistance to corrosion and corrosion
fatigue are necessary. Widely used as springs and
instrument parts.

under laboratory conditions below 4000C. However, such very slow cooling
rates are never encountered in industrial production methods and we can
assume that the a + 72 structure persists in alloys containing between 9.4
and 16.2% aluminium which are cooled reasonably slowly ('furnace
cooled') to ambient temperatures. Consequently that part of the consti-
tutional diagram below 5000C can be ignored for our purposes and is not
shown here.
Like the brasses the aluminium bronzes can be divided into two main
groups; the cold-working and the hot-working or casting alloys respect-
ively. The constitutional diagram indicates that a solid solution (a) contain-
ing up to 9.4% aluminium at room temperature, is formed. Like the other
a solid solutions based on copper, it is quite ductile. With more than 9.4%
aluminium the phase y2 is formed. This is an intermetallic compound of
the formula Cu9Al4 and, in common with compounds of this type, is very
hard and brittle, resulting in an overall brittleness of alloys containing the
y2-phase.
16.51 Further inspection of the constitutional diagram reveals simi-
larities between it and the iron-carbon diagram. The two a-phases are
analogous; the (3-phase solid solution of the copper-aluminium diagram
corresponds to the y (austenite) phase of the iron-carbon diagram; and
the a + Y2 eutectoid is similar to the ferrite + cementite eutectoid (pearlite)
of the steels. As a result of these similarities in the positions of the phase
fields in the respective diagrams, a 10% aluminium bronze can be heat
treated in a manner parallel to that of steel so that a martensite-type
transformation occurs. Nevertheless it should be realised that the crystal-
lography of the aluminium bronzes is different from that of the correspond-
ing steels.
Consider a 10% aluminium bronze; this will consist entirely of the phases
a and y2 if it is allowed to cool slowly in a furnace to ambient temperature.
If it is reheated the a + y2 eutectoid is transformed to the solid solution (3
when the eutectoid temperature (565°C) is reached, and as the temperature
rises further, the a-phase is absorbed until at about 9000C the structure
consists entirely of the solid solution (3. Water-quenching from this tem-
perature produces a structure consisting of the phase p'. This is not shown
in the equilibrium diagram, since, like martensite in steels, it is not an
equilibrium phase. The P'-phase is hard and brittle like martensite, and is
in fact very similar in microstructural appearance. Tempering this P'-phase
at 5000C causes the precipitation of a fine agglomerate of the phases a and
y2, closely resembling the tempered martensite of a steel treated in a paral-
lel manner.
In fact the thermal equilibrium characteristics of 10% aluminium bronze
resemble more closely those of an air-hardening alloy steel than those of
a plain carbon steel. For example, if the 10% aluminium bronze is air
cooled from the P-phase field ('normalised') then the resultant structure is
likely to be either P' ('martensitic') or a bainitic type of structure containing
finely precipitated y2. The a + Y2 ('pearlitic') structure will only be obtained
by annealing, followed by furnace cooling to ambient temperature. Ex-
tremely slow cooling under controlled laboratory conditions may cause a

further structural change to take place at 385°C with the formation of

concern us here.
16.52. In spite of these heat-treatment phenomena, the main industrial
uses of aluminium bronzes depend upon other features such as:
(a) the ability to retain strength at elevated temperatures, particularly
when certain other elements are present;
(b) the high resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures;
(c) good corrosion-resistance at ordinary temperatures;
(d) good wearing properties;
(e) the pleasing colour which makes some of these alloys useful for
decorative purposes, particularly as a substitute for gold in imitation
jewellery.
A serious drawback to the wider use of aluminium bronze has always
been present in the difficulties arising during casting. Since aluminium
oxidises so readily at the high casting temperature necessary (above
11000C), oxide skin and dross is persistently formed and will be drawn into
the mould during casting unless special non-turbulent methods of casting
are employed (2.33-Pt2). Such skilled casting techniques inevitably cost
more money.
16.53 The ('-phase Cold-working Alloys contain between 4.0 and
7.0% aluminium and occasionally up to 4.0% nickel, which improves cor-
rosion-resistance still further. This latter type of alloy is particularly useful
in the manufacture of condenser tubes and heat-exchangers, where high
strength and corrosion resistance are required up to temperatures of about
3000C. Since the composition of these a-phase alloys can be adjusted to
give a colour similar to that of 18-carat gold, rolled sheet is used in the
manufacture of imitation-gold cigarette-cases and for other decorative
articles of this type. In less permissive times large quantities of the alloy were
used for cheap 'wedding rings'. Many products originally made from alu-
minium bronze are now produced in anodised aluminium the surface of
which is further treated to give a gold-like finish at lower cost.
16.54 The a + y2 Hot-working and Casting Alloys with between
7.0 and 12.0% aluminium, may also contain other elements, such as iron,
nickel or manganese. The hot-working alloys contain from 7.0 to 10.0%
aluminium and are shaped by forging or by hot-rolling according to their
subsequent application. These alloys may also contain up to 5.0% each of
iron and nickel, the iron acting as a grain-refiner. Such alloys are used for
chemical-engineering purposes (especially for components exposed to high
temperatures); also for a variety of purposes where a corrosion-resistant
forging is required.
The alloys used for sand- and die-casting contain between 9.5 and 12.0%
aluminium with varying amounts of iron and nickel up to 5.0% each, and
manganese up to 1.5%. These alloys are used widely in marine engineer-
ing, eg for pump rods, valve fittings, propellers, propeller shafts and bolts.
They are also used for valve seats and sparking-plug bodies in internal-

combustion engines and for brush-holders in generators; for bearings to
work at heavy duty; for gear wheels; for pinions and worm wheels; and in
the manufacture of non-sparking tools such as spanners, wrenches, shovels
and hammers in the potentially 'dangerous' gas, paint, oil and explosives
industries, though they are softer and hence inferior to beryllium bronze
in this direction.
Copper-Nickel Alloys
16.60 As the thermal-equilibrium diagram (Fig. 9.9) shows, the metals
copper and nickel are soluble in each other in all proportions, forming a
continuous series of solid solutions. In the cast condition cored crystals will
be present, but, though coring may be extensive, it can never lead to the
precipitation of a brittle secondary phase, as may happen with the other
copper alloys dealt with. On annealing, all copper-nickel alloys consist of
uniform solid solutions.
16.61 Being completely solid solution in structure, the copper-nickel
alloys are all ductile. They are also very accommodating with regard to the
methods of manufacture, and can be hot or cold-worked by rolling, forging,
stamping, pressing, drawing and spinning. The absence of any second
phase in the microstructure eliminates the possibility of electrolytic cor-
rosion (21.70) in the presence of an electrolyte, and this contributes to the
high corrosion-resistance of copper-nickel alloys. This corrosion-resistance
reaches a maximum with Monel Metal. Cladding of ships' hulls and parts
in off-shore structures with 90-10 cupro-nickel is now widely used as a
protection against marine corrosion. Details of the more important cop-
per-nickel alloys are included in Table 16.4.
16.62 Nickel Silvers are alloys containing from 10 to 30% nickel, 55
to 63% copper and the balance zinc. They are all completely solid solution
in structure, and comparable with similar brasses as far as mechanical
properties are concerned. They are, however, white in colour, which makes
them admirably suitable for the manufacture of spoons, forks and other
table-ware. Being ductile, the alloys can be cold-formed for these applica-
tions and are usually silver-plated (the stamp EPNS means 'electroplated
nickel silver'). The current fashion for stainless steel table-ware has meant
a decline in the popularity of the more expensive EPNS. A lot of brassware
carrying a very thin 'flashing' of silver also now masquerades as EPNS.
The addition of 2.0% lead makes nickel silvers easy to engrave and such
alloys are used in the manufacture of Yale-type keys where the presence
of lead increases the ease with which the blank can be cut.

Copper Alloys which can be Precipitation
Hardened
16.70 It is often assumed that 'age hardening' or, more properly, 'precipi-
tation hardening' (9.92), is a phenomenon confined to the light alloys.
Some of the copper-base alloys can nevertheless be so treated, though
these alloys have on the whole rather specialised uses.
16.71 Beryllium Bronze is one of the most outstanding of these alloys.
It contains 1.75-2.5% beryllium and up to 0.5% cobalt, the balance being
copper. It is solution-treated at 8000C (Fig. 16.6(i)), quenched, cold-
worked (if necessary) and then precipitation-hardened at 275°C for one
hour. After such treatment the alloy attains the remarkable tensile strength
of 1300-1400 N/mm2 due to the formation of the coherent precipitate |3'.
It is particularly suitable for the manufacture of tools where non-sparking
properties are required (hammers, chisels and hacksaw blades in gas, oil,
paint and explosives industries and in 'dangerous' mines), since it is both
hard and tough. It also has a high fatigue strength and is therefore used
for the manufacture of springs and for diaphragms and tubes of pressure-
recording instruments.
16.72 Chromium Copper containing 0.4-0.5% chromium (Fig.
16.6(ii) is another heat-treatable alloy which finds use in electrical switch-
gear and as pressure (spot and seam) welding electrodes (20.61), since it
combines a reasonable strength of 540 N/mm2 with an electrical conduc-
tivity of 80% in the hardened state. It is quenched from 10200C (P in Fig.
16.6(ii)) and precipitation hardened at 4500C.
16.73 Zirconium Copper The solid solubility of zirconium in copper
increases from about 0.01% at 00C to 0.15% at the eutectic temperature
of 965°C. Consequently copper-base alloys containing approximately

0.12% Zr can be solution treated at 9500C followed by quenching to give
a super-saturated solid solution which is then precipitation treated at 4500C
to form a coherent precipitate (probably Cu3Zr). Mechanical properties
are similar to those of chromium copper.
Copper containing small amounts of both zirconium and chromium (0.7
Cr; 0.1 Zr) have slightly better strength after heat-treatment. These
materials are used in commutators because of their good thermal and
electrical conductivities; rocket nozzles and resistance-welding electrodes.
16.74 Titanium Copper alloys containing 2.5 and 4.0% titanium are
in production. The 4% alloy is solution treated at 850-9000C (Fig. 16.6(iii))
for one hour, quenched and then cold-worked up to 40% reduction. It is
then precipitation hardened in the range 400-5250C to give a tensile
strength of 1076 N/mm2. It has similar applications to beryllium bronze,
ie bellows and diaphragms; springs; electrical contacts and non-sparking
tools.
16.75 K Monel The mechanical properties of ordinary monel metal
(16.61) can be further improved by the addition of 2.0-4.0% aluminium
to give an alloy designated K Monel. This alloy can be solution treated,
cold-worked and then precipitation-hardened to give a tensile strength as
high as 1160 N/mm2.
Some brasses and bronzes which contain small quantities of nickel and
aluminium can be precipitation hardened. Thus an alloy containing 20 Zn;
6 Ni; 1.5 Al; bal.Cu is quenched from 8500C and then precipitation hard-
ened at 5000C. These alloys are used for machine parts such as gear wheels;
instrument pinions and pressings where strength, hardness and corrosion
resistance are important.
16.76 'Narcoloy' an aluminium bronze, contains 7 Al; 0.5 Co and
0.25 Sn. It is an a-type alloy and its heat-treatment does not depend upon
the formation of martensite as with the a + y2 aluminium bronzes (16.50),
but upon precipitation hardening. It is solution treated at 8000C, cold-
worked up to 25% and then precipitation hardened at 4500C to give a
tensile strength of 580 N/mm2 and a hardness of 250 Hv. Its high impact
value coupled with excellent resistance to stress corrosion make it particu-
larly useful in marine atmospheres for cold-forged bolts and thread-rolled
studding.
Since it has an attractive gold-like appearance, takes a high polish and
resists corrosion by all household detergents and vinegar, it is suggested
that it could be used for tableware such as forks and spoons.
'Shape Memory' Alloys
16.80 'Shape memory' is a phenomenon associated with a limited number
of alloy systems and was first investigated in 1951 in some gold-cadmium
alloys. The fundamental characteristics of these alloys is the ability to
exist in two distinct shapes or crystal structures above and below a critical
transformation temperature. Below the critical temperature a martensitic

type of structure forms and develops as the temperature falls further. This
martensitic change is unlike that observed in steels in that it is reversible,
and as the temperature is raised again the martensite is absorbed and
ultimately disappears. This reversible change in structure is linked to a
change in dimensions and the alloy exhibits a 'memory' of the high and
low temperature shapes.
16.81 The best know commercial 'memory metals' are in the copper-
zinc-aluminium system—the SME ('shape-memory-effect') brasses—the
compositions of which vary in the range 55-80% copper with 2-8% alu-
minium, the balance being zinc. By choosing a suitable composition, tran-
sition temperatures between —70 and +1300C can be achieved. The usable
force associated with the change in shape can be employed to operate a
range of temperature-sensitive devices; snap on/off positions often being
obtained by the use of a compensating bias spring. Following progress with
the SME brasses other alloys are being developed in this field, eg a Cu-
Al-Ni alloy which operates in the region of 2500C. SM alloys also exhibit
other interesting characteristics, including superelasticity where large
recoverable strains can be introduced into the material. These strains dis-
appear as the alloy is heated past its transition point. Among such alloys
is a nickel-titanium series of which Nitinol (55Ni-45Ti) is possibly the
best known. It has a transition temperature of 115°C.
16.82 The SM alloy element is generally in the form of a heavy-gauge
coiled-spiral spring and such units are used in automatic greenhouse venti-
lators, thermostatic radiator valves, liquid-gas safety switches, de-icing
switches on air-conditioning plant, valves in solar heating systems, electric
kettle switches, boiler damper safety switches and warning devices to indi-
cate the presence of ice on roads.
Many other more sophisticated uses are currently being developed for
these alloys. Thus Nitinol is used in a number of aerospace projects, for
example in the form of a coupling ring for joining stainless steel and
titanium tubes. The ring contracts on reaching its transition temperature
and four knife-like protrusions lock mechanically on to the tube surfaces
to form a hermetic seal. Another SM nickel-titanium alloy is used for the
manufacture of spectacle frames. The martensitic alloy used results in the
frame being soft and comfortable to wear, and if it is accidentally bent
the frame can be restored to its original shape by immersion in warm
water. A more unexpected use is in the engineering of underwired 'bras'.
The low 'yield' strength and superelastic straining at relatively constant
stress apparently makes these garments very comfortable to wear and virtu-
ally impossible to bend out of shape. This contrasts with conventional
underwires which are either comfortable or durable but not both.

Aluminium and its Alloys
17.10 The properties of aluminium which chiefly dictate its use as an
engineering material are its low relative density coupled with a reasonably
high tensile strength when used in one of its alloyed forms. Since its relative
density is only about one third that of steel its alloys are widely used
in aero-, automobile and constructional engineering. A combination of
alloying and heat-treatment can produce alloys which, weight-for-weight,
are in the same class as many steels.
17.11 The high affinity of aluminium for oxygen is both disadvan-
tageous and useful. It is disadvantageous in so far as it increases the cost
of extraction of the metal by making necessary a relatively expensive elec-
trolytic extraction process. Usually a metal is extracted by heating its oxide
ore with a cheap reducing agent, such as carbon (in the form of coke), and
the resulting crude metal is refined by allowing the bulk of the impurities
present in it to be oxidised. This is the basis for the production of pig iron
and its subsequent conversion to steel. The very high chemical affinity of
aluminium for oxygen means that aluminium cannot be reduced by carbon
by ordinary chemical means. Obviously any other reducing agents able
to separate aluminium from oxygen will be thermodynamically far too
expensive, so that aluminium can only be produced economically by elec-
trolytic means.
It was using an expensive reducing agent in the form of metallic potass-
ium which enabled the Danish physicist and chemist H. C. Oersted to
produce the first samples of aluminium in 1825. Consequently aluminium
was worth about £250 per kg in those days, and, even later, it is said that
the more illustrious foreign guests to the Court of Napoleon III were
privileged to use forks and spoons made from aluminium, whilst the French
nobility had to be content with mere gold plate and silver cutlery. In the
Gay Nineties aluminium was still regarded as being in the nature of a
curious precious metal, though it was in 1886 that C. M. Hall, a twenty-two-
year-old student, had discovered a relatively cheap method for producing
aluminium by electrolysing a fused mixture of aluminium oxide and the
mineral cryolite.
17

Aluminium cannot be purified by blowing air through it, as in the case
of iron. This treatment would oxidise the aluminium and leave behind the
impurities. Therefore the ore must be purified before being electrolysed,
and this involves an expensive chemical process. The ore of aluminium is
bauxite, which is named after Les Baux, in the south of France, where it
was discovered in 1821. Although France is still an important producer of
bauxite, Jamaica and the Republic of Guinea mine the largest quantities of
the ore followed by the CIS, Surinam and Guyana. In Europe Hungary,
Greece and Jugoslavia, in addition to France, all produce considerable
quantities of the ore. Britain is wholly dependent upon imported ore to
maintain a token small-scale production at the Kinlochleven and Lochaber
works, both of which are sited with access to water transport and relatively
cheap hydroelectric power in the Scottish Highlands; but most aluminium
is imported as the metal.
17.12 Although aluminium has a great affinity for oxygen, its corrosion-
resistance is relatively high. This is due to the dense impervious film of
oxide which forms on the surface of the metal and protects it from further
oxidation. The corrosion-resistance can be further improved by anodising
(21.91), a treatment which artificially thickens the natural oxide film. Since
aluminium oxide is extremely hard, wear-resistance is also increased by
the oxide layer; and the slightly porous nature of the surface of the film
allows it to be coloured with either organic or inorganic dyes. In this
respect high oxygen-affinity is an asset.
The high affinity of aluminium for oxygen also makes it useful as a
deoxidant in steels and also in the Thermit process of welding (20.52).
17.13 The fact that aluminium has over 50% of the specific conduc-
tivity of copper means that, weight for weight, it is a better conductor of
electricity than is copper. Hence it is now widely used, generally twisted
round a steel core for strength, as a current carrier in the electric 'grid'
system. Large increases in the price of copper a few years ago led to the
use of aluminium as a domestic current carrier, though this type of wire is
often copper coated to increase the conductivity of the surface skin.
17.14 Unlike copper which is normally available as a high-purity metal
because of the ease of its electrolytic refinement, commercial grades of
'pure' aluminium may contain no more than 99.0% of the metal. This is
due to the difficulty in refining crude aluminium already mentioned.
Although electrolytic refining methods are now practised producing alu-
minium of 99.99% purity this is obviously costly. Available commercial
qualities covered by BS specifications contain 99.99%, 99.8%, 99.5%,
99.0% aluminium respectively. The lower commercial grades are used
fairly widely for drawing, pressing and spinning large numbers of cooking
and other kitchen utensils to which non-stick coatings of PTFE (polyte-
trafluoroethene) can be applied where necessary. Aluminium is suitable
for both hot- and cold-working processes but unlike copper, another FCC
metal, it does not exhibit annealing twins following recrystallisation.
Pure aluminium is relatively soft and weak with a tensile strength of no
more than 90 N/mm2 in the annealed condition, so that for most other
engineering purposes it is used in the alloyed form.

Alloys of Aluminium
17.20 The addition of alloying elements is made principally to improve
mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, hardness, rigidity and
machinability, and sometimes to improve fluidity and other casting pro-
perties.
17.21 One of the chief defects to which aluminium alloys are prone is
porosity due to gases dissolved during the melting process. Molten alu-
minium will dissolve considerable amounts of hydrogen if, for any reason,
this is present in the furnace atmosphere. When the metal is cast and
begins to solidify the solubility of hydrogen diminishes almost to zero, so
that tiny bubbles of gas are formed in the partly solid metal. These cannot
escape, and give rise to pinhole porosity. The defect is eliminated by
treating the molten metal before casting with a suitable flux, or by bubbling
nitrogen or chlorine through the melt. A more practical method is to use
specially prepared tablets of hexachloroethane which decompose liberating
small quantities of chlorine when the tablet is plunged beneath the surface
of the melt.
17.22 Aluminium alloys are used in both the cast and wrought con-
ditions. Whilst the mechanical properties of many of them, both cast and
wrought, can be improved by precipitation hardening, a number are used
without any such treatment being applied. Forty years ago there was a
bewildering multitude of aluminium alloys in the manufacturers' lists. For-
tunately obsolescence and rationalisation has reduced the number con-
siderably, though some new compositions have been introduced as a result
of expansion of the market for aluminium alloys outside the field of
aerospace.
17.23 Most of the aluminium alloys available commercially are sup-
plied according to British Standards Specifications and are covered by
General Engineering Specifications BS 1470/1475 (wrought materials) and
BS 1490 (cast alloys). Specialised applications are covered under a number
of supplementary specifications, whilst a few manufacturers produce alloys
not covered by a BS number. For wrought alloys the general specification
number, ie BS 1470/1475, is followed by a four-digit designation identifying
a specific alloy. The first of the four digits indicates the alloy group as
follows:
Aluminium (99.0% min. and
greater) 
- lxxx
Aluminium alloy groups (by
major alloying elements): 
Copper 
- 2xxx

- 3xxx
Silicon 
- 4xxx
Magnesium 
- 5xxx
Mg + Si 
- 6xxx
Zinc 
- 7xxx
Other elements 
- 8xxx
Unused series 
- 9xxx

In the first group (aluminium containing more than 99.0% Al) the last
two digits are the same as the two digits to the right of the decimal point
in the 'minimum % aluminium' when expressed to the nearest 0.01%. The
second digit in the designation indicates modifications in impurity limits or
alloying elements. When the second digit is zero it indicates unalloyed
aluminium having natural impurity limits; integers 1 to 9, assigned consecu-
tively as required, indicate special control of one or more impurities or
alloying elements.
In Groups 2xxx to 8xxx the last two digits in the designation have no
special significance and are used only to identify different alloys in the
group. The second digit in the designation indicates modifications. Thus,
if the second digit is zero it indicates the original alloy; integers 1 to 9
assigned consecutively indicate modifications. National variations of
wrought aluminium alloys registered by another country are identified by
a serial letter after the four-digit designation.
The condition of the material may be denoted by suffix letters as follows:
M 
- material 'as manufactured'.
O 
- fully annealed to give lowest strength.
Hl
to
H8 - work-hardened. Material cold-worked after annealing.
Designations are in ascending order of strength and
hardness.
TB - solution-treated 
and 
'aged' 
naturally. 
(Material
receives no cold-work after solution treatment.)
TE - cooled from an elevated-temperature shaping process
and precipitation hardened.
TF - solution treated and precipitation hardened.
TH - solution treated, cold-worked and then precipitation
hardened.
TD - solution treated, cold-worked and 'aged' naturally
(tubes).
The cast aluminium alloys are covered by BS 1490 and here the suffix
letters indicate the condition of the material as follows:
M 
- 'as cast' with no further treatment
TS - castings 'stress relieved' only
TE - precipitation treatment after casting
TB - solution treated only
TB7 - solution treated and 'stabilised'
TF - solution treated and precipitation hardened
TF7 - solution treated, precipitation hardened and then
'stabilised'.
It is convenient to classify aluminium alloys into the following four main
groups according to the condition in which they are employed.

Wrought Alloys Which Are Not Heat-treated
17.30 The main requirements of alloys in this group are sufficient strength
and rigidity in the work-hardened state, coupled with good corrosion-
resistance. These properties are typical of the alloys shown in Table 17.1.
As will be seen, these alloys are widely used in the manufacture of panels
for land-transport vehicles. Here the high corrosion-resistance of the alu-
minium-magnesium alloys is utilised, those with a higher magnesium value
having an excellent resistance to sea-water and marine atmospheres, so
that they are used extensively for marine superstructures. The desired
mechanical properties are produced by the degree of cold-work applied in
the final cold-working operation, and these alloys are commonly supplied
as soft (0), or having undergone varying degrees of work-hardening as
denoted by the BS Specification suffixes Hl, H2, H3, etc. up to H8 (full
hard). The main disadvantage is that, once the material has been finished
to size, no further variation can be made in mechanical properties (other
than softening by annealing), whereas, with the precipitation-hardening
alloys, the properties can be varied, within limits, by heat-treatment.
17.31 As would be expected, most of these alloys (the main exception
being those of aluminium and silicon) have structures consisting entirely
of solid solutions. This is a contributing factor to their high ductility and
high corrosion-resistance. In the case of aluminium-magnesium alloys the
solubility of magnesium falls sharply from 14.9% at 451°C to about 1.5%
at 00C (Fig. 17.1). Consequently care must be taken to cool these alloys
rapidly in order to prevent the intercrystalline precipitation of the inter-
mediate phase (3 which would lead to intercrystalline corrosion and em-
brittlement. Some of the alloys listed are occasionally used in the cast
condition.
17.32 Recently a number of superplastic alloys have been developed
for use by stretch forming techniques. Early development work was carried
out on the eutectic alloy (Al-33Cu) (4.64) but currently the most widely
used alloy is 'Alcan 2004' (Al-6Cu-0.4Zr). Some of these alloys can be
further strengthened by precipitation treatment.

production. These alloys can be rolled to foil which has higher strength
and good electrical conductivity, the rolling technique being such that
nearly all of the iron remains out of solid solution. In this condition it has
a considerable dispersion hardening effect whilst at the same time, since
little iron is in solution, electrical conductivity remains high.
Cast Alloys which are not Heat-treated
17.40 Alloys in this group are widely used in the form of general-purpose
sand castings and die castings. They are used where rigidity, good corrosion
resistance and fluidity in casting are of greater importance than strength.
17.41 Undoubtedly the most widely used alloys in this class are those
containing between 9.0 and 13.0% silicon, with occasionally small amounts
of copper. These alloys are of approximately eutectic composition (Fig.
17.2), a fact which makes them eminently suitable as die-casting alloys,
since their freezing range will be small. The rather coarse eutectic structure
can be refined by a process known as modification. This consists of adding
Fig. 17.2 
The 'modification' of aluminium-silicon alloys.
In (i) the structure consists of primary silicon + eutectic because the composition is just to
the right of the eutectic point (11.6% Si). Note that the eutectic is very coarse and consists
of needles of silicon in a matrix of a (aluminium rich).
(ii) Here 'modification' has displaced the eutectic point to the right (14% Si) so that the
composition of the alloy under consideration is now to the left of this point and the structure
consists of primary a (light) + eutectic. The latter is now extremely fine-grained and gives
superior mechanical properties.

small amounts of sodium (about 0.01% by weight of the charge) to the
melt just before casting. The effect is to delay the precipitation of silicon
when the normal eutectic temperature is reached, and also cause a shift of
the eutectic composition towards the right of the equilibrium diagram.
Therefore, as much as 14% silicon may be present in a modified alloy
without any primary silicon crystals forming in the structure (Fig. 17.2).
It is thought that sodium collects in the liquid at its interface with the
newly-formed silicon crystals, inhibiting and delaying their growth. Thus,
undercooling occurs and new silicon nuclei are formed in large numbers
resulting in a relatively fine-grained eutectic structure. Remelting tends to
restore the original structure due to a loss of sodium by oxidation. The
modification process raises the tensile strength from 120 to 200 N/mm2 and
the elongation from 5.0 to over 15.0%. The relatively high ductility of this
cast eutectic alloy is due to the fact that the a-solid-solution phase in the
eutectic constitutes nearly 90% of the total structure. As will be seen (Fig.
17.2) it is therefore continuous in the microstructure and acts as a cushion
against much of the brittleness arising from the hard silicon phase.
These aluminium-silicon alloys can therefore be produced in the
wrought form, though they are better known as materials for die-casting
and other types of casting where intricate sections are required, since high
fluidity and low shrinkage, as well as the narrow freezing range mentioned
above, make them very suitable for such purposes. Their high corrosion-
resistance makes these alloys useful for marine work, and the fact that
they are somewhat lighter than the aluminium-copper alloys makes them
suitable for aero and automobile construction.
17.42 Aluminium-copper alloys containing up to 10% copper were
popular in the early days of the aluminium industry. These contained
considerable amounts of the brittle compound CuAl2 (see Fig. 17.3) and
were useful when rigidity and good casting properties were required in
components not subjected to shock. They also machined well but since
their corrosion-resistance was poor they have become completely obsolete.
However, small amounts of copper are added to some of the alu-
minium-silicon alloys in order to improve strength and machinability at
the cost of some losses in castability and corrosion resistance. One of these
alloys (LM4) though generally used in the 'as-cast' form is responsive to
heat-treatment.
17.43 The main feature of the aluminium-magnesium-manganese
alloys is good corrosion resistance which enables them to receive a high
polish. Since many of these alloys are also rigid and shock-resistant they
are very suitable for moderately-stressed parts in marine constructions.
Wrought Alloys which are Heat-treated
17.50 Without doubt the most metallurgically-important feature of the
aluminium alloys is the ability of some of them to undergo a change in
properties when suitably heat-treated. Although this phenomenon is
common to many alloys in which a change in solubility of some constituent

in the solvent metal takes place with variation in temperature (9.90) it is
more widely used in suitable aluminium-base alloys than in any others.
The phenomenon was first observed by a German research metallurgist,
Dr. Alfred WiIm who, in 1906, noticed that an aluminium-copper alloy
which had been water-quenched from a temperature of about 5000C, sub-
sequently hardened unassisted at ambient temperature over a period of
several days. The strength increased in this way, reaching a maximum
value in just under a week, and the effect was subsequently known as
age-hardening. About four years later WiIm transferred the sole rights of
his patent to the Diirener Metal Works in Germany, and the alloy pro-
duced was named Duralumin. Although this name is often used to describe
any wrought aluminium alloy of this type, it is, strictly speaking the pro-
prietary name given to a series of alloys produced by certain companies
both here and abroad. The first significant use of duralumin was during
the First World War, when it found application in the structural members
of the airships bearing the name of Graf von Zeppelin.
17.51 The 'age-hardening' process can be accelerated and higher
strengths obtained if the quenched alloy is heated at temperatures up to
1800C. Such treatment was originally known as artificial age-hardening but
both of these descriptions have been replaced in metallurgical nomencla-
ture by the general term precipitation hardening. Much speculation took
place over the years as to the fundamental nature of this phenomenon but
metallurgists now generally agree that the increases in strength and hard-
ness produced are directly connected with the formation of coherent pre-
cipitates (9.92) within the lattice of the parent solid solution. We will
consider the application of this principle to the precipitation-hardening of
aluminium-copper alloys.
17.52 Let us assume that we have an aluminium-copper alloy contain-
ing 4.0% copper. At temperatures above 5500C this will consist entirely of
a solid solution as indicated by the equilibrium diagram (Fig. 17.3). If we
now allow the alloy to cool very slowly to room temperature, equilibrium
will be reached at each stage and particles of the intermetallic compound
CuAl2 (0) will form as a non-coherent precipitate. This precipitation will
commence at A and continue until at room temperature only 0.2% (X)
copper remains in solution in the aluminium. The resulting structure will
lack strength because only 0.2% copper is left in solution, and it will be
brittle because of the presence of coarse particles of CuAl2.
If the alloy is now slowly reheated, the particles of CuAl2 will be gradu-
ally absorbed, until at A we once more have a complete solid solution a
(in industrial practice a slightly higher temperature, B, will be used to
ensure complete solution of the CuAl2). On quenching the alloy we retain
the copper in solution, and, in fact, produce a supersaturated solution of
copper in aluminium at room temperature. In this condition the alloy is
somewhat stronger and harder because there is more copper actually in
solid solution in the aluminium, and it is also much more ductile, because
the brittle particles of CuAl2 are now absent. So far these phenomena
permit of a straightforward explanation, forthcoming from a simple study
of the microstructure. What happens subsequently is of a sub-microscopical

nature, that is, its observation is beyond the range of an ordinary optical
microscope.
17.53 If the quenched alloy is allowed to remain at room temperature,
it will be found that strength and hardness gradually increase (with a corre-
sponding reduction in ductility) and reach a maximum in about six days.
After this time has elapsed no further appreciable changes occur in the
properties. The completely a-phase structure obtained by quenching is not
the equilibrium structure at room temperature. It is in fact super-saturated
with copper so that there is a strong urge for copper to be rejected from
the solid solution a as particles of the non-coherent precipitate CuAb (0).
This stage is never actually reached at room temperature because of the
sluggishness of diffusion of the copper atoms within the aluminium lattice.
However, some movement does occur and the copper atoms take up pos-
itions within the aluminium lattice so that nuclei of the intermediate phase
(0') are formed. These nuclei are present as a coherent precipitate continu-
ous with the original a lattice, and in this form, cause distortion within the
a lattice. This effectively hinders the movement of dislocations (9.92) and
so the yield strength is increased. The sub-microscopical change within the
structure can be represented so:

An improvement in properties over those obtained by ordinary natural
age-hardening can be attained by tempering the quenched alloy at tempera-
tures up to nearly 2000C for short periods. This treatment—called precipi-
tation treatment—increases the amount of the intermediate coherent
precipitate 0' by accelerating the rate of diffusion, and so strength and
hardness of the alloy rise still further. If the alloy is heated to a higher
temperature, a stage is reached where the structure begins to revert rapidly
to one of equilibrium and the coherent intermediate phase 0' precipitates
fully as non-coherent particles of 0 (CuAh):

When this occurs both strength and hardness begin to fall. Further
increases in temperature will cause the 0 particles to grow to a size making
them easily visible with an ordinary optical microscope, and this will be
accompanied by a progressive deterioration in mechanical properties. Fig.
17.4 illustrates the general effects of variations in time and temperature
during post-quenching treatment for a typical alloy of the precipitation-
hardening variety. At room temperature (200C) the tensile strength
increases slowly and reaches a maximum of about 390 N/mm2 after approxi-
mately 100 hours. Precipitation-treatment at temperatures above 1000C

TREATMENT TIME (H)

will result in a much higher maximum tensile strength being reached. Opti-
mum strength is obtained by treatment at 165°C for about ten hours, after
which, if the treatment time is prolonged, rapid precipitation of non-
coherent particles of 6 (CuAl2) will cause a deterioration in tensile strength
and hardness as shown by curve C. Treatment at 2000C, as represented by
curve Z), will give poor results because the rejection from solution of
non-coherent 9 is very rapid such that precipitation will overtake any
increase in tensile strength. This process of deterioration in structure and
properties due to faulty heat-treatment is generally termed 'reversion'.
Time and temperature of precipitation-treatment differ with the compo-
sition of the alloy, and must always be controlled accurately to give opti-
mum results.
17.54 Precipitation-hardening is not confined to the aluminium-base
alloys, but can be applied to alloys of suitable composition from many
systems in which a sloping phase boundary such as X A Y (Fig. 17.3) exists.
As far as aluminium alloys are concerned, those containing copper and
those containing magnesium and silicon (which cause hardening due to the
formation of Mg2Si) are the most important. In addition, precipitation-
hardening is utilised in a number of magnesium-base alloys (18.11),
titanium alloys (18.62), some copper-base alloys (16.70) and certain steels.
17.55 A number of alloys are sold under the general trade name of
Duralumin. Whilst some of them rely on the presence of approximately
4% copper to effect hardening, others contain magnesium and silicon so
that hardening will be assisted by the coherent precipitation of Mg2Si. The
original Duralumin contained 4.0 Cu; 0.5 Mg; 0.5 Si; 0.7 Fe; and 0.7 Mn,
the main function of the manganese being as a grain refiner.
The initial hot-working of duralumin, either by hot-rolling or extrusion,
is done between 400 and 4500C. This treatment breaks up the coarse eutec-
tic to some extent, and the alloy can then be cold-worked. It is subsequently
solution-treated at 480-5000C for one to three hours in order to absorb

the CuAl2 and Mg2Si and is then water-quenched. Accurate temperature
control is essential, as the temperature of treatment must be maintained
between A and C (Fig. 17.3). After quenching, cold-working operations
can be carried out on the resulting solid-solution structure if desired. The
alloy is subsequently hardened, either by allowing it to remain at room
temperature for about five days or by heating it to some temperature
between 100 and 1600C for up to ten hours, according to the properties
required. Heating at above 1600C may cause visible particles of CuAl2
to appear in the microstructure, with consequent losses in strength and
hardness.
17.56 Just as the application of heat will accelerate precipitation-
hardening so will refrigeration impede the process. This fact was utilised
extensively in aircraft production during the Second World War. An alloy
rivet must be of such a composition that it will 'age' at ambient tempera-
ture, since it is inappropriate to precipitation-harden a completed airframe
structure by any sort of furnace treatment. Unfortunately once solution-
treated such a rivet will soon begin to harden at ambient temperature and
if this hardening had begun any attempt to drive the rivet in this hard
condition would cause it to split. Hence, immediately after quenching from
the solution-treatment temperature, rivets were transferred to a refriger-
ator at about — 200C. By this means age-hardening was considerably slowed
down and rivets could be stored at sub-zero temperatures until required.
17.57 Although the addition of copper forms the basis of many of the
precipitation-hardening aluminium alloys, copper is absent from a number
of them which rely instead on the presence of magnesium and silicon.
Such alloys have a high electrical conductivity approaching that of pure
aluminium, so that they can be used for the manufacture of overhead
conductors of electricity. Most commercial grades of aluminium contain
iron as an impurity, but in some of these alloys it is utilised in greater
amounts in order to increase strength by promoting the formation of FeALi,
which assists in precipitation-hardening. Titanium finds application as a
grain refiner, whilst other alloys containing zinc and chromium produce
tensile strengths in excess of 620 N/mm2 in the heat-treated condition.
17.58 In the 1920s aluminium-lithium alloys were investigated as
being potentially useful in aircraft construction, since the low relative den-
sity of lithium (0.51) could mean reductions of 10% in the density of alloys
containing the metal. Subsequently interest was revived in lithium as an
alloying element and the US Navy's 'Vigilante' contains the alloy '2020',
though here lithium was used to increase the temperature range over which
existing aluminium-copper alloys could be used rather than to reduce
weight. More recent research has been based on alloys containing 2.5%
lithium along with small amounts of magnesium, copper and—as a grain
refiner—zirconium. The development of RSP (9.110) has led to experiments
with alloys containing 4% lithium since under these conditions more
lithium is retained in solution.
Since lithium is one of the chemically reactive 'alkali metals' in Group
I of the Periodic Classification (Fig. 1.2) there are difficulties encountered
in melting and casting these alloys. Moreover, early aluminium-lithium

alloys failed because of poor ductility and impact values. However, in
recent British alloys, these values have been maintained at satisfactory
levels along with a relative density of only 2.54, and hence an increase in
specific modulus (2.36) of up to 25%.
Precipitation hardening is due mainly to the phase S' (AbLi) a precipi-
tate coherent with the matrix. Magnesium is added to reduce density
further and also confer limited solid-solution hardening, but unfortunately
this leads to the formation of detrimental grain-boundary precipitates of
Al2MgLi. However the addition of some copper causes the precipitation
of 6' and the phase Ti (Al2CuLi) instead. The simultaneous precipitation
of two phases gives rise to an appreciable improvement in impact toughness
when precipitation of the two phases is suitably controlled.
A selection of typical wrought heat-treatable alloys of aluminium is given
in Table 17.3.
Cast Alloys which are Heat-treated
17.60 German air-raids on England during the First World War were
carried out by 'Zeppelins', the airframes of which were constructed from
Duralumin. Britain's defence against these raids was provided by heavier-
than-air flying machines, the airframes of which were largely of non-
metallic construction. Nevertheless light-weight internal combustion
engines were required to power these aircraft and the National Physical
Laboratory carried out much of the development work on new aluminium
alloys in those days.
One of the very successful alloys developed by NPL is still known by
the series letter used to identify it during development—Y Alloy. Like
Duralumin this is of the 4% copper type but contains also about 2% nickel
and 1.5% magnesium. Precipitation-hardening is due to the combined
effects of coherent precipitates based on both CuAl2 and NiALi, and whilst
fundamentally a casting alloy it can be used in the wrought condition. As
a cast alloy it is useful where reasonable strength at high temperatures is
required, as in high-duty pistons and cylinder heads for internal combustion
engines. Its relatively low coefficient of expansion also makes it useful in
this direction.
17.61 There are other casting alloys similar in composition to 4Y Alloy',
but containing rather less copper. Some of these alloys (eg RR50) can be
precipitation hardened by heating at 155-1700C without the usual prelimi-
nary solution-treatment at a high temperature. This is due to sluggishness
in precipitation of phases like CuAl2 and NiAl3 as the casting cools, follow-
ing the initial pouring process. The 5.0 and 13.0% types of aluminium-sili-
con alloy are brought into this group by the addition of small amounts of
either copper and nickel or magnesium and manganese, which render the
alloys amenable to precipitation-hardening.
17.62 The use of aluminium-silicon alloys for automobile cylinder
blocks has obvious advantages in terms of weight saved as compared with
the usual iron casting. Other advantages include higher thermal conduc-

tivity which assists heat transfer in the water cooling and lubrication
systems; and enhanced corrosion resistance. Moreover, die-casting can be
used in the production of aluminium alloys further reducing production
costs when large numbers of castings are involved. Unfortunately the wear-
resistance of normal 11-13% silicon alloys is inadequate and cast iron
liners need to be fitted resulting in increased costs.
Recently a range of hyper-eutectic aluminium-silicon alloys was de-
veloped. These contain 18-25% silicon and because of the presence of
large amounts of primary silicon the wear resistance of these alloys is

adequate for their use in cylinder blocks without the inclusion of cast-iron
liners. Both the wear-resistance and mechanical strength of these alloys
can be improved considerably by controlling the size and distribution of
the primary silicon. The finer and more evenly distributed the primary
silicon the better the wear resistance. A number of methods have been
proposed to refine this primary silicon and include the addition of small
amounts of phosphorus, arsenic or sulphur to the melt just prior to casting.
Since copper, magnesium and nickel are also present (LM29) in sufficient
quantities these alloys can be further hardened and strengthened by pre-
cipitation treatment. However, despite the apparent advantages of the
high-silicon alloys production difficulties have presumably prevented them
from becoming established even though they are adequately covered in BS
1490.
A selection of the alloys representative of this group is given in Table
17.4.

Metals And Alloys
Magnesium-base Alloys
18.10 It is perhaps surprising that magnesium-base alloys should be suit-
able for engineering purposes, since in composition they are similar to the
incendiary bombs used by the RAF and the Luftwaffe during the Second
World War. Incendiary-bomb cases contained about 7% aluminium (which
was added to introduce better casting properties) and small amounts of
manganese; the balance being magnesium. Fortunately, combustion of
such an alloy takes place only at a relatively high temperature, and this
was generated by filling the bomb case with thermit mixture (20.52). Ordi-
narily, magnesium alloys can be melted and cast without mishap, provided
that the molten alloy is not overheated.
18.11 Although pure magnesium is a relatively weak metal, its alloys
containing suitable amounts of aluminium, zinc or thorium can be strength-
ened considerably by precipitation-hardening. The thermal-equilibrium
diagrams (Fig. 18.1) indicate the changes in solid solubility of these three
metals in the respective a-phases; changes which are necessary if precipi-
tation-hardening is to be effected (9.92).
18.12 Small amounts of manganese, zirconium and the rare earth
metals are also added to some magnesium alloys. Manganese improves
corrosion-resistance, whilst zirconium is an effective grain refiner. Thorium
and the rare-earth metals (in particular, cerium) give further increase in
strength whilst allowing the alloy to retain a somewhat higher ductility,
but their most important function is to give improved creep-resistance at
high working temperatures.
The greater strength obtained by alloying, coupled with their low relative
density of about 1.8, makes these alloys particularly useful where weight

is a limiting factor. Such uses include various castings and forgings used in
the aircraft industry—landing-wheels, petrol tanks, oil tanks, crankcases
and airscrews, besides many engine parts in both piston and jet engines.
Those alloys which can be precipitation hardened are first solution treated
at temperatures between 3000C and 565°C—4100C for those alloys contain-
ing aluminium; 3200C for those containing zinc; and 565°C for those con-
taining thorium as indicated by the equilibrium diagrams (Fig. 18.1).
Precipitation treatment is usually carried out at between 170° and 2000C
for up to 12 hours. Examples of both cast and wrought alloys are given in
Tables 18.1 and 18.2.
18.13 The melting and casting of these alloys present some difficulty
in view of the ease with which molten magnesium takes fire, particularly
when overheated. They are generally melted under a flux containing the
fluorides of calcium and sodium and the chlorides of potassium and mag-
nesium. During the casting operation flowers of sulphur is often dusted on
to the stream of molten alloy. The sulphur takes fire in preference to the
magnesium, and thus protects the latter with a surrounding atmosphere of
sulphur dioxide gas. Nevertheless modern developments such as fluxless
melting and mechanical stirring have improved commercial production in
recent years.
Zinc-base Die-casting Alloys
18.20 Zinc-base alloys containing 4% aluminium and small amounts of
copper and magnesium have been used for many years for die casting a
wide range of components both in engineering industries and for domestic
appliances, and were sold initially under the trade name of 'Mazak'. These
alloys have excellent casting properties as well as reasonable strength and
rigidity and are used for many parts in washing machines, radio sets, alarm

18.21 Difficulty was experienced in the development of these zinc-base
alloys owing to swelling of the casting during use, coupled with intercrystal-
line embrittlement. These faults were found to be due to intercrystalline
corrosion caused by small amounts of cadium, tin and lead. For this reason
high-grade zinc of four nines quality (ie 99.99% pure) is used for the
manufacture of these alloys, and the impurities thus limited to the small
quantities indicated in Table 18.3.
18.22 Normally, after casting, these zinc-base alloys undergo a slight
shrinkage which is complete in about five weeks. When close dimensional
limits are necessary a stabilising anneal in dry air at 100±5°C for six hours
should be given before machining, in order to accelerate any volume
change that is likely to take place.
In order to test these alloys for growth and intercrystalline corrosion,
the steam test is applied. This accelerates the formation of these defects,
and consists in suspending the test piece above water at 95°C in a closed
vessel for ten days. The test piece is then examined for expansion, and

mechanically tested to reveal any intercrystalline corrosion which may have
occurred.
18.23 Of the two casting alloys generally available, alloy A is used for
engineering purposes since it has greater dimensional stability and re-
sponds consistently to the stabilising anneal. It is also more ductile and
retains its impact strength at high temperatures much better than alloy B.
The corrosion resistance of alloy A is also superior. Alloy B, however, has
greater strength and hardness as well as better castability in thin sections
and is therefore used for such components as zip-fastner slides and small
gear wheels.
18.24 In recent decades the relatively low-strength die-cast alloys have
been replaced for many purposes by plastics mouldings. This, together
with a fashion change away from chromium-plated finishes, led to a big
decline in the use of the 4% aluminium (BS1004) alloys. However a new
series of zinc-base alloys containing greater quantities of aluminium and
copper has been developed to give increased strength and hardness, and
it is expected that these will find increasing use in the automobile industries
as engine mountings and other parts where strength and toughness com-
bined with a saving in weight are involved.
Three new alloys, designated by the trade ZA8, ZA12 and ZA27 contain
respectively 8, 11 and 27% aluminium along with small amounts of copper
and magnesium (Table 18.3). As with the BS1004 alloys the impurities

lead, cadmium, tin and iron need to be strictly controlled in order to
preserve dimensional stability. Whilst ZA8, like the BS1004 alloys, can be
pressure die cast both ZA12 and ZA27 are more suitable for gravity die
casting.
18.25 These alloys, like the BS1004 alloys, undergo changes both in
mechanical properties and dimensions as a result of an ageing process
subsequent to being cast. As is indicated in the zinc-aluminium equilib-
rium diagram (Fig. 18.2) a eutectoid change occurs in these alloys at 275°
when the solid solution |3' transforms to a pearlite-like eutectoid of a and
|3. However the rapid cooling which prevails during die casting suppresses
the eutectoid change. This is further aggravated by the presence of copper
which also retards the eutectoid transformation.
Subsequently ageing occurs as the |3' phase—unstable at ambient tem-
peratures—gradually reverts to the a + |3 eutectoid with passage of time.
This leads to a general deterioration in mechanical properties and at the
same time a change in volume. The ZA27 alloy is sometimes heat treated
by cooling down slowly from above the eutectoid temperature in order to
produce a fine lamellar eutectoid (cf. normalising in steel—11.60) and as a
result much improved toughness and ductility. The ductile/brittle transition
temperature is also depressed from 00C to — 200C. In order to stabilise it
against volume changes the ZA27 alloy can be aged for a short time just
below the eutectoid temperature.
18.26 The corrosion resistance of zinc-base alloys is adequate for most
atmospheric environments. However, the availability of zinc anodising
(21.90) and other protective finishes make them useful in aggressive marine
environments such as oil platforms in the North Sea. One such treatment,
chrornate passivation, involves immersion of the castings in a solution con-
taining sulphuric acid and sodium dichromate.

Nickel-Chromium High-temperature Alloys
18.30 The main feature of the nickel-chromium alloys is their ability to
resist oxidation at elevated temperatures. If further suitable alloy additions
are made the strength is increased under conditions of stress at high tem-
peratures. Alloys rich in nickel and chromium have a high specific resist-
ance to electricity, which makes them admirable materials for the
manufacture of resistance wires, and (because of their low rate of oxidation
at high temperatures) heater elements of many kinds capable of working
at temperatures up to bright red heat. Such alloys (the Brightray series)
are included in Table 18.4.
18.31 A further group of high-temperature, nickel-chromium-base
alloys are those containing iron and, sometimes, molybdenum and tung-
sten. Of these the Inconel series has been long established. Inconel 600
contains 76Ni; 16Cr; and 7Fe and is resistant to many acids and alkalis
as well as oxidising atmospheres at high temperatures. Since it retains
reasonable strength at high temperatures it is used for furnace equipment
including retorts, muffles, heat-treatment trays, supports and nitriding

boxes, as well as for exhaust manifolds and electric heating elements for
cookers. Hastelloy C (59Ni; 17Mo; 15Cr; 5Fe; and 4W) is resistant to
corrosion by oxidising acids such as nitric and sulphuric, as well as to
oxidising and reducing atmospheres up to 100O0C; whilst Hastelloy X
(51Ni; 22Cr; 18Fe; 9Mo) is a high-temperature alloy maintaining good
oxidation resistance and reasonable strength up to 12000C making it useful
in furnace equipment and combustion systems of jet aircraft.
18.32 By far the most spectacular of the nickel-chromium-base alloys,
however, are those of the Nimonic series. Nimonic is a trade name coined
by Messrs. Henry Wiggin, the manufacturers of these alloys, which have
played a leading part in the construction of jet engines. They are basically
nickel-chromium alloys which will resist oxidation at elevated tempera-
tures, but which have been further stiffened for use at high temperatures
by the addition of small amounts of titanium, aluminium, cobalt, molyb-
denum and carbon in suitable combinations. 'Nimonics' and 'super-alloys'
generally must have a high creep resistance at high temperatures. Since
creep proceeds by the thermally-activated movement of dislocations
through the lattice, the basic requirements for high creep resistance are a
high elastic modulus and low diffusion rates within the lattice at high
temperatures. The presence of one or more of the elements mentioned
above will provide solute atoms in which the atom size produces sufficient
lattice distortion to increase the elastic modulus, and at the same time have
low diffusion rates.
The most important strengthening mechanism depends upon the forma-
tion of coherent precipitates—generally designated y'—within the lattice
of the nickel-base matrix. These coherent precipitates are based on the
intermetallic compounds TiNi3, AlNb, or NbNi3 which, like the nickel-base
matrix have a FCC structure. However, there is a very small difference
(less than 1%) in lattice dimensions between matrix and compound and
since the mismatch is slight the compounds are able to form coherent
precipitates within the nickel-base matrix which remain stable at high tem-
peratures. Any carbides present form as finely-dispersed particles which
strengthen the grain boundary regions and inhibit intergranular fracture.
Some of these alloys are dispersion strengthened (8.62) by the inclusion
of particles of yttrium oxide Y2O3. Uniform distribution of such insoluble
particles cannot be achieved by normal casting processes. Hence the pow-
dered base alloy is ground with Y2O3 powder in a ball mill to promote
uniform mixing and 'mechanical alloying' of the components. The blend is
then hot extruded to consolidate the alloy which may be shaped by further
hot-working processes.
The result is a series of alloys which will withstand oxidation and mech-
anical stresses at working temperatures in excess of 10000C. In addition to
their use in jet engines, they find application as thermocouple sheaths,
tubular furnaces for the continuous annealing of wire, jigs for supporting
work during brazing or vitreous enamelling, gas retorts, extrusion dies and
moulds for precision glass manufacture. Some of the current Nimonic
alloys together with other Wiggin 'super alloys' are shown in Table 18.5
whilst the relationship between strength and temperature for some of these

'Nimonic' high-temperature alloys.
18.33 Nickel-base Corrosion-resistant Alloys containing molyb-
denum, iron, usually chromium and sometimes small amounts of tungsten
and copper are used at ordinary temperatures in the chemical industries
where they are in contact with concentrated acids and other extremely
corrosive liquids. At ordinary temperatures up to 200C molybdenum dis-
solves in nickel in the solid state and this increases both corrosion resistance
and strength. The Hastelloy series of alloys is probably the most important
in this group. Hastelloy B (65Ni; 28Mo; 5Fe) is used for transporting and
storing hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid and other non-oxidising acids;
whilst Hastelloy C (59Ni; 17Mo; 15Cr; 5Fe; 4W) has a high resistance
to a wide range of corrosive media including oxidising liquids and those
containing chlorides. It is also reasonably resistant to concentrated sul-
phuric acid at ambient temperatures and to phosphoric acid both cold and
boiling.
Bearing Metals
18.40 Bearings are devices used to transmit loads between relatively-
moving surfaces. They may be either plain bearings involving sliding con-
tact between surfaces or more complex bearings using costly ball- or
roller-components. In this instance we shall consider alloys used for plain
bearings.
TENSILE STRENGTH (N/mm*)
alioys is shown in Fig. 18.3. It should be appreciated, however, that the
true criteria to usefulness will be high creep strengths at elevated tempera-
tures, available with these alloys.
TEMPERATURE (0C)

If lubrication were always perfect and bearing surfaces accurately fitted
so that 'running in' was unnecessary, then almost any metal would suffice
as a bearing provided that it was strong enough to carry the load. In fact
it is often difficult to align a long shaft accurately enough to run in a series
of bearings. Consequently a relatively soft, malleable material is preferable
so that it will align itself to the journal when under pressure. This prevents
the build-up of stress at any 'high spots' on the surface so that the journal
is less likely to be scored by grit in the lubricant. Nevertheless the bearing
must be strong enough and hard enough, preferably with a low-friction,
wear-resistant surface. This set of properties is generally not obtained in
a single-phase alloy for, whilst solid solutions are tough, ductile and strong
they are also rather soft; and whilst intermetallic compounds are hard,
they are also brittle and weak. Hence, traditionally, bearing metals have
been two-phase alloys, eg white metals and bronzes. In these materials
harder, low-friction particles are held in a malleable, soft solid-solution (or
eutectic) matrix. This matrix tends to wear, providing channels which assist
the flow of lubricant.
Another desirable characteristic of a bearing metal is its ability to form
'soaps' with the lubricant, whilst low overall hardness will minimise damage
to the shaft starting and stopping, when oil pressure may be low and the
tendency towards pressure-welding of the journal to the bearing surface at
its greatest.
Bearing materials are of three main types:
(i) Two-phase alloys of the traditional types, eg white metals and
bronzes;
(ii) Two-phase alloys in which one phase can become a lubricant in
extreme circumstances, eg leaded bronzes and aluminium-tin alloys;
(iii) Single-phase materials, eg nylon and PTFE (polytetrafluoro-
ethene).
18.41 Copper-base Bearing Alloys include the phosphor-bronzes
(containing from 10 to 13% tin and 0.3 to 1.0% phosphorus) and the plain
tin bronzes (containing from 10 to 15% tin). Both types of bronze satisfy
the structural requirements of a bearing metal, since they contain particles
of the hard intermetallic compound 6 (O131 Sn8) embedded in a tough
matrix of the solid solution a. These alloys are very widely used for bear-
ings of many types where the loading is heavy.
For small bearings and bushes of standardised sizes, sintered bronzes
are often used. These are generally of the self-lubricating type, and are
made by mixing copper powder and tin powder together, in the proportions
of a 90-10 bronze, with the addition of graphite. The mixture is then
compacted and sintered (6.53—Part I and 6.50—Part II) to produce a
semi-porous, self-lubricating alloy suitable for low-duty bearings in sizes
up to about 75 mm diameter shaft.
Leaded bronzes (Table 16.2) are used for main bearings in aero-engines,
and for automobile and diesel crankshaft bearings. They have a high resist-
ance to wear, and their good thermal conductivity enables them to keep

cool when running. Should lubrication fail the lead is extruded under pres-
sure, as overheating sets in, and forms a lubricating film which prevents
seizure—a necessary feature with aircraft bearings. These alloys contain
5-30% lead and since lead is insoluble in molten bronze these bearings
are often centrifugally cast to prevent excessive segregation of the lead.
Alternatively, segregation is reduced by adding small amounts of nickel.
Some of these bearings consist of sintered porous copper infiltrated with
lead. Corrosion of the lead by sulphur compounds in the lubricant is pre-
vented by overlaying the surface with a coating of lead-indium or tin-
indium which is encouraged to diffuse into the bearing surface by low-
temperature heat-treatment.
18.42 White Bearing Metals may be either tin-base or lead-base. The
former, which represent the better-quality white bearing alloys, are often
called Babbitt metals, after Isaac Babbitt, their original patentee. All of
these alloys contain between 3.5 and 15.0% antimony, much of which
combines with some of the tin present to form an intermetallic compound
SbSn. This compound forms cubic crystals, usually called cuboids (see
Plate 18.1) which are hard and of low-friction properties.
Let us assume that we have a plain tin-antimony alloy containing 10%
antimony, as being typical of a basic bearing-metal analysis. Fig. 18.4
shows the tin-rich end of the tin-antimony equilibrium diagram. Our 10%
alloy will begin to solidify at X by depositing cuboids of the hard intermet-
allic compound SbSn. These SbSn crystals are of lower specific gravity than
the liquid which remains, and they therefore tend to float to the surface of
the melt. At 246°C a peritectic reaction takes place, and the solid solution a
is formed as an in-filling between the cuboids. As the temperature falls, the
solubility of antimony in tin decreases from about 10.3% at the peritectic
temperature to 3.5% at room temperature, so that if cooling is slow
enough, more cuboids of SbSn are precipitated uniformly within the solid
solution a. Nevertheless, the segregation of the primary cuboids of SbSn
at the surface of the cast bearing is a serious fault. It can, however, be
minimised in one of the following ways:

Part of the tin-antimony thermal equilibrium diagram.

(a) By rapidly cooling the cast alloy when possible. The metal then
solidifies completely before the cuboids have had an opportunity to rise
to the surface.
(b) By adding up to 3.5% copper to the alloy. This combines with
some of the tin, forming a network of needle-shaped crystals of Cu6Sn5
which precipitates from the melt before the cuboids of SbSn begin to
form. This network traps individual cuboids as they develop and prevents
their movement towards the surface, thus ensuring a uniform cast struc-
ture. Moreover, the compound Cu6Sn5, being hard, improves the general
bearing properties.
Lead is added in the interests of cheapness, and this forms solid solutions
of limited solubility with both tin and antimony. These solid solutions form
a eutectic structure. In some of the cheap bearing metals, eg. Magnolia
metal, tin is omitted completely. The cuboids then consist of almost pure
antimony, embedded in a eutectic matrix of antimony-rich and lead-rich
solid solutions. These lead-rich alloys are intended only for low pressures.
The more important white bearing metals are indicated in Table 18.6.
18.43 Aluminium-tin Bearing Alloys The more recent philosophy of
using a duplex structure consisting of two interlocking networks—one
strong and the other soft and capable of acting as a lubricant under
occasional high contact pressures—led to the development of alu-
minium-tin alloys as bearings. These alloys contain approximately
80Al-20Sn. The two metals form a eutectic series (Fig. 18.5) in which the
eutectic contains only 0.5% aluminium and solidifies at 228°C so that the
alloy in question solidifies over a range of more than 4000C and segregation
is a considerable danger. Nevertheless, by a combination of cold-rolling

and recrystallisation the tin network is broken up to some extent so that
the aluminium forms a continuous strong matrix. Bearing shells of this
type are generally carried on a steel backing strip and have been widely
used in automobile design both for main and big-end bearings.
18.44 Polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) and Nylon as non-metallic
bearing materials are competing with metals in many fields. The coefficient
of friction of PTFE (\i = 0.03-0.1) is lower than for any other solid
material. Unfortunately its mechanical properties are poor so that it has
to be strengthened by the use of some 'filler' material. PTFE/bronze com-
posites (Plate 18.2) are useful up to temperatures of 3000C—the upper
working limit for PTFE. They are used in the automobile industry as
bearings in windscreen wipers and steering system bushes. Nylon can be
reinforced with bronze particles. An important feature of both materials
is that they function well as 'dry' bearings. Hence they are useful in machin-
ery for the preparation of food and textiles where contamination by a
lubricant would be unacceptable. They are also useful in some cases where
a bearing is so inaccessible as to make its lubrication difficult.

Fusible Alloys
18.50 These contain varying amounts of lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium,
and are generally ternary or quaternary alloys of approximately eutectic
composition. A number of such alloys will melt below the boiling point of
water, and in addition to such obvious uses as the manufacture of teaspoons
for practical jokers, they are used for metal pattern work, for the fusible
plugs in automatic fire-extinguishing sprinklers, for bath media in the low-
temperature heat-treatment of steels and for producing a temporary filling
which will prevent collapse of the walls during the bending of a pipe.
Bismuth-rich alloys such as Cerromatrix expand slightly on cooling, and
are useful for setting press-tool punches in their holders.

Titanium and its Alloys
18.60 Mention of the use of small amounts of titanium in some steels and
aluminium alloys has already been made. In recent years titanium has
become increasingly important as an engineering material in its own right,
both in the commercially pure and alloyed forms.
Titanium is not a newly discovered element (it was discovered in Corn-
wall in 1791 by W. Gregor, an English priest), and is only rare in the sense
that it is a little-used metal, and one which is expensive to produce. In
Nature it is very widely distributed, being the tenth element in order of
abundance in the Earth's crust. Of the metallurgically useful metals only
aluminium, iron, sodium and magnesium occur more abundantly (Table
1.2). Nevertheless it is unlikely that titanium will ever be an inexpensive
metal because of its high chemical affinity for all non-metals except for the
noble gases. For this reason it can only be produced by reducing its chlor-
ide, TiCU, with magnesium—obviously an expensive process—and the

titanium so produced will react with all orthodox crucible materials. Hence
it can only be remelted in vacuum by using an electric arc process in
which the electrode consists of the titanium 'sponge' (produced by chloride
reduction) and in which the crucible is virtually of titanium. This seemingly
impossible feat is achieved by using a water-cooled copper crucible on to
which a layer of titanium freezes—a thermodynamically inefficient but
necessary situation.
Very strong titanium alloys can be produced and since the relative den-
sity of the metal is only 4.5 then these alloys have a very high specific
strength (2.36). Its high melting point (1725°C) has contributed to its use
in jet-engine construction. Moreover the creep properties and fatigue
strengths of titanium alloys are very satisfactory so that they are finding
increasing use in aerospace industries. As an example the four engines of
Concorde contain some 16 tonnes of titanium alloys.
18.61 Although titanium is chemically very reactive it has an excellent
corrosion resistance. Like aluminium it coats itself with a dense protective
oxide skin. It is now very extensively used, generally in the 'commercially
pure' form, in chemical plant where it will resist attack under extremely
hostile conditions such as are provided by strong acids, chloride solutions
and bromine. By adding 0.15% of the noble metal palladium the corrosion
rate can be reduced by up to 1500 times because of 'anodic passivation'.
18.62 Titanium is a bright silvery metal and, when polished, resembles
steel in appearance. The high-purity metal has a relatively low tensile
strength (216 N/mm2) and a high ductility (50%), but commercial grades
contain impurities which raise the tensile strength to as much as 700 N/
mm2 and reduce ductility to 20%. It is an allotropic element. The a-phase,
which is hexagonal close-packed in structure, is stable up to 882.5°C, whilst
above this temperature the body-centred cubic |3-phase is stable. The poly-
morphic change point is affected by alloying in a similar manner to the A3
point in iron (13.11). Thus, alloying elements which have a greater solu-
bility in the a-phase than in the (3-phase tend to stabilise a over a greater
temperature range (Fig. 18.6(i)). Such elements include those which dis-
solve interstitially—oxygen, nitrogen and carbon—and also aluminium

which dissolves substitutionally. Elements which tend to dissolve in |3, and
consequently stabilise it, are usually those which, like (3, are body-centred
cubic in structure. These are mainly the transition elements iron, chro-
mium, molybdenum, etc., and the resulting equilibrium diagrams are of
the types (ii) or (iii) (Fig. 18.6). Those alloys represented by an equilibrium
diagram of type (iii) could be expected to undergo a martensite-type trans-
formation (12.22) if quenched from the (3-range, and indeed they do.
However, unlike the hard martensite produced by quenching steel the
martensite formed here is relatively soft because the solute atoms are
substitutionally dissolved and do not produce the same degree of lattice
distortion as do the interstitially dissolved carbon atoms in steel. Due to
considerable sluggishness the eutectoid transformation in type (iii) alloys
is rarely complete and can be neglected so that most alloys can be regarded
as belonging to group (i) or (ii) as far as subsequent heat-treatment is
concerned.
18.63 The (3-phase in alloys tends to be hard, strong and less ductile
than the relatively soft a-phase. Nevertheless, the (3-phase forges well so
that most of the commercial alloys, which are of the a + |3 type, are
hot-worked in the (3 range. Those elements like aluminium and tin which
stabilise a tend to strengthen alloys by normal solid solution effects but
the a + (3 alloys formed when molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, silicon
and copper are added are strengthened by heat-treatment. Low alloy
additions of these group (ii) and (iii) elements tend to give a martensitic
structure when quenched from the (3-range but with higher alloy additions
a completely (3 structure is retained. Suitable ageing treatment produces a
finely-dispersed precipitate of a within the (3 structure and the best all-
round combination of mechanical properties. However, during the ageing
treatment a very brittle intermediate phase oo is first precipitated but pro-
longed treatment causes this to disappear and be replaced by a. Conse-
quently ageing treatment must be carried out in the region of 5000C for 24
hours to ensure the removal of all oo and its subsequent replacement by
finely-divided a. Most of the heat-treatable titanium alloys are first solution
treated in the range 850-10500C according to composition, followed by
ageing at 5000C for 24 hours.
18.64 Titanium alloys are now extensively used in both airframe and
engine components of modern supersonic aircraft because of the attractive
combination of specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance. Ex-
pensive precision cameras now contain titanium-alloy parts requiring low
inertia such as shutter blades and blinds, whilst the high corrosion resist-
ance of titanium has led to its use as surgical implants as well as in the
chemical industries. Some alloys of titanium are given in Table 18.8.

Uranium
18.70 The mineral pitchblende was formerly thought to be an ore of
tungsten, iron or zinc, until in 1789 M. H. Klaproth proved that it contained
what he called 'a half-metallic substance' different from the three elements
named. He named this new element Uranium in honour of Herschel's
discovery of the planet Uranus a few years earlier. It was not until 1842,
however, that E. M. Peligot, by isolating the metal itself, showed that
Klaproth's 'element' was in fact the oxide.
18.71 In the solid form uranium is a lustrous, white metal with a bluish
tint, and capable of taking a high polish. It is a very heavy metal, having
a relative density of 18.7. Pure uranium is both malleable and ductile, and
commercially it can be cast and then fabricated by rolling or extrusion,
followed by drawing. It is a chemically reactive metal and oxidises at
moderately high temperatures. Consequently, it must be protected during
fabrication processes. For atomic energy purposes it is usually vacuum
melted in high-frequency furnaces, and cast in 25 mm diameter rods.
Chemically, uranium is similar to tungsten and molybdenum. Like them,
it forms stable carbides which led to the experimental use of uranium in
high-speed steels. These steels have not survived, since they showed no
advantage over the orthodox alloys.
18.72 Uranium is one of a number of elements which undergo natural
radioactive disintegration. During such spontaneous disintegration three
different types of emission proceed from the source—the so-called a, (3
and Y 'rays'. The phenomenon generally referred to as a-rays is in fact the
effect produced by a stream of moving particles—a-particles. An
a-particle is, in effect, of the same constitution as the nucleus of a helium
atom. Similarly, (3-rays consist of a stream of fast-moving |3-particles (in
actual fact these are electrons). Only y-rays are in fact true electromagnetic
radiation, and since this radiation is of short wavelength it is able to pen-
etrate considerable thicknesses of metal.
All three forms of radiation are emitted at some stage in the natural
radioactive disintegration of uranium, 238U. Obviously the loss of an a-part-
icle from the nucleus of a 238U atom will cause a change in both its atomic
mass number and atomic number and consequently in its properties. In
this general way 238U changes in a series of steps to radium, and finally to
a stable, non-radioactive isotope of lead (206Pb). Each stage of the radio-
active decay is accompanied by the emission of one or more of the types
of radiation described above. A somewhat simplified representation of this
process is indicated in Fig. 18.7
18.73 Some stages in the process of radioactive disintegration take
place more quickly than others, and each separate decay process is gov-
erned by the expression—

Fig. 18.7 Stages in the radioactive disintegration of uranium, H8U.
where n is the number of atoms of the species present and X is a constant
for that species. Integration of this expression and evaluation of the time
necessary for half of the atoms present, initially, to decompose gives what
is called the half-life period of the species.
Thus—
0.6932
^=-r~
Each radioactive species is characterised by its half-life period. Thus it
takes 4.5 x 109 years for half of the 238U atoms present in a mass of uranium
to change to the next uranium isotope in the series, whilst it takes only
1590 years for half of the radium atoms present to change to the radioactive
gas radon.
18.74 Until its development as a source of fissionable material,
uranium was little more than a chemical and metallurgical curiosity so that,
before 1943, there was no commercial extraction process operating with
the object of uranium as the sole product. Its industrial use, before the
Second World War, was limited to the manufacture of electrodes for gas-

18.75 The reader will, no doubt, associate uranium with the production
of nuclear power. This element has two principal isotopes (1.90), the atoms
of which contain 92 protons and 92 electrons in each case. However, one
isotope has 146 neutrons giving a total mass of 238, whilst the other has
143 neutrons giving a total mass of 235. These isotopes are generally rep-
resented by the symbols 923U and 925U respectively. Here the lower index
represents the number of protons (92) in the nucleus (the atomic number,
Z) and the upper index represents the total number of protons and neu-
trons (the atomic mass, A, of the isotope).
Fig. 18.8 The fission of an atom of uranium, | f U.
Here, isotopes of the metal barium, 550Ba, and the 'noble' gas krypton, Il Kr, have been
produced together with three neutrons, Jn. About thirty similar reactions are known to take
place during the fission of a H5U atom, the two isotopes produced varying in mass number
accordingly between 72 and 162. One such radioactive isotope is the notorious 'strontium
ninety', ie §jjSr.
Since a neutron has no electrical charge, and hence suffers neither attrac-
tion nor repulsion by either the negatively charged electrons or positively
charged protons, it can be fired into the nucleus of an atom. When a
neutron enters the nucleus of an atom of 925U the latter becomes unstable
and splits into two approximately equal portions (Fig.18.8). At the same
time a small reduction in the total mass occurs, for although the total
number of particles (protons and neutrons) remains the same after fission,
the sum of the masses of the resultant nuclei is slightly less. This is a
measure of the mass equivalent of the nuclear binding energy. Einstein's
Theory of Relativity states that mass and energy are not distinct entities
but are really different manifestations of the same thing. The two are
related to the velocity of light (c) by the expression:
E = me2
Since the velocity of light is 2.998 x 108 m/s it follows that even a small
loss in mass can result in a great release of energy. As is often the case in
engineering problems this energy is emitted in the form of heat. It can be
calculated that the energy produced by the loss of one gramme of matter
in this way is sufficient to heat about 200 tonnes of water from 0 to 1000C.

Fig. 18.9 Chain fission of 925U atoms.
Fission is also accompanied by the emission of neutrons and if the overall
mass of 925U is great enough, other atoms will absorb some of these neu-
trons so that a chain reaction occurs leading to an 'atomic explosion'. There
is a 'critical size' for a mass of 925U. Below this critical size neutrons will
tend to escape rather than be absorbed by 925U nuclei, and a chain reaction
will not, therefore, be promoted.
18.76 The rate of production of nuclear energy from this source can
be controlled by introducing into an 'atomic pile' rods of some element
which will absorb unwanted neutrons and thus control the rate of disinte-
gration of other 925U atoms. In natural uranium total disintegration will
not occur since only 0.7% 925U is present, mixed with the more common
isotope 928U. Isotope 92s will however, absorb a neutron to give an atom
of nuclear mass 239. This undergoes further change to produce plutonium,
949U, which can be used as a concentrated fuel in such 'fast reactors' as
that at Dounreay.
Some Uncommon Metals
18.80 Of the sixty-nine metallic elements which occur naturally in the
surface of our Earth only about half find any metallurgical applications.
Some—like those of Group I—are far too chemically reactive, whilst
others lack mechanical properties which interest the engineer. The tech-
nology of some 'new' metals has been developed because of properties
which are of value in nuclear engineering. Others would be of greater
interest to the aerospace industries were they not so expensive because of
scarcity or high extraction costs. Several of these metals have very high

melting points coupled with high corjosion resistance so that they and their
alloys join the ranks of the expensive 'superalloys'.
18.81 Beryllium was in fact discovered as long ago as 1797 by Vauque-
lin. The famous chemist Wohler first produced the metal in quantity in
1828 but commercial development did not begin until 1916 in the USA.
Beryllium bronze (16.71) first made its appearance commercially in the
early 'thirties' but it is only in recent years that interest has been focused
on the possibilities of using beryllium in the pure form or as an alloy base.
For a 'light' metal beryllium has a very high melting point (1285°C) so
that it can be used over a wide range of temperatures. It also has good
strength and reasonable corrosion resistance. Since beryllium is less dense
than aluminium but potentially stronger, the aerospace industries would
be much more interested in the metal than they are, were it not for diffi-
culties in forming but above all its extreme scarcity. The only significant
source of beryllium is the mineral beryl, a semi-precious stone, mined in
a number of countries but notably Brazil, Argentina and Central Africa.
It is also present in the precious stone emerald.
In France beryllium is known as 'glucinium', a reference to the sweet
taste of some of its compounds. The metal is, however, extremely toxic
giving rise to a chronic form of poisoning called 'berylliosis'. This resembles
septic pneumonia and constitutes a further hazard in fabricating the metal.
Moreover, although malleable the metal lacks ductility, a fact which
restricts the methods which can be used to shape it. Beryllium crystallises
in the CPH form and metals with this type of structure are generally
more brittle than those which crystallise in one of the cubic forms (4.12).
Nevertheless beryllium is successfully extruded to produce bar, tube and
various sections. Hot-working the metal in a mild steel sheath is a common
method of shaping beryllium.
One property which interests the nuclear engineers is the low neutron
absorption of beryllium. That is, it does not significantly impede the pass-
age of neutrons. For this reason beryllium was initially popular as a canning
material for nuclear fuel but partly because of its scarcity it has been largely
replaced by zirconium alloys. Since it is transparent to X-rays beryllium is
used for X-ray windows. Its low inertia has led to use in some expensive
camera shutters whilst its high melting point has made it useful in neon-sign
electrodes and targets for cyclotrons.
Beryllium has found limited use in aerospace structures, jet-engine tur-
bine parts and also as a neutron source using a-particles from plutonium.
Commercial quality beryllium (92Be; 4.5BeO; 0.2 max.Al; 0.5 max.C; 0.3
max.Fe) has a yield strength of approximately 560 N/mm2 and a tensile
strength of 890 N/mm2.
18.82 Zirconium In 1789 Klaproth identified a new metal in the min-
eral zircon, but it was Berzelius who, in 1824, succeeded in isolating zir-
conium. It was not until 1914 that the metal was produced in sufficient
quantity to show that it was ductile. Then, during the First World War,
rumours circulated that Germany was developing zirconium steels. Inten-
sive research by the Allies, however, failed to produce an alloy of this type
with useful properties. Eventually zirconium became known chiefly as an

alloying addition to magnesium-base alloys (18.12), whilst its oxide zircona
was developed as a high-temperature refractory. In more recent years it
has been used in some of the titanium-base alloys (18.62).
In 1944 research was instituted with the object of producing high-purity
zirconium and to-day it is probably the most useful nuclear-engineering
material for use where low neutron absorption is necessary. In other
respects too zirconium is an attractive proposition in nuclear engineering.
As compared with beryllium it is relatively plentiful, and is also superior
to beryllium in corrosion resistance. Moreover, zirconium and its alloys
can be fabricated with comparative ease provided that the metal is not
heated in contact with either oxygen, nitrogen or hydrogen. Each of these
gases will form interstitial solid solutions in zirconium leading to its em-
brittlement.
Unalloyed zirconium tends to be mechanically weak at high tempera-
tures. In addition, under such conditions it is rapidly corroded by water
vapour and carbon dioxide. These difficulties have been largely overcome
by alloying and most of the zirconium now used in nuclear engineering is
supplied as alloys such as 'Zircaloy IF (1.5Sn; 0.12Fe; 0.05Ni; 0.1Cr;
BaI.Zr) or 'Zircaloy IV (1.5Sn; 0.2Fe; 0.1Cr). These alloys are used for
fuel sheathing and structural components in pressurised-water reactors
because of their combination of low neutron absorption, high strength and
good corrosion resistance.
Since zirconium is chemically reactive in the powdered form it is com-
pacted with lead to make lighter 'flints'. Before the days of 'electronic
flash' it constituted the wire in many consumable photographic flash bulbs.
In the form of ferro-zirconium or ferro-silico-zirconium it can be used as
a 'scavenger' in steel making since it removes traces of both oxygen and
sulphur. Any residue refines the grain of steel whilst the strength of some
alloy steels is increased. Zirconium occurs chiefly as 'zircon sands' and is
mined in Brazil, India, the USA and around the Australian coast. It is
extracted from its minerals in a similar way to titanium.
18.83 Hafnium One of the main difficulties in the use of zirconium as
a nuclear canning material is the presence of small amounts of hafnium
which materially increase neutron absorption. Unfortunately hafnium is
always closely associated with zirconium in the mineral deposits of the
latter, and the reduction of the hafnium content to the few parts per
million which is all that can be tolerated in reactor-quality zirconium, is an
expensive operation. Both zirconium and hafnium belong to the same
'transition group' in the Periodic Classification. Consequently their chemi-
cal properties are so alike that their separation is difficult and, hence,
costly. In respect of neutron absorption, however, they are at opposite
ends of the scale for, whilst zirconium has a very low neutron absorption,
that of hafnium is extremely high.
For some time hafnium was used as control rods in nuclear reactors
because of its high neutron absorption and because the 'daughter' atoms
formed by such neutron bombardment were hafnium isotopes. This led to
little dimensional change in the rods. Of recent years hafnium has been
replaced by less expensive materials so that it now finds little industrial use.

The existence of hafnium was first suspected towards the end of the
nineteenth century and it was discovered in rare-earth residues in 1911,
though its properties were not verified until 1923. It appears to be named
after Hafnia, the ancient name for Kobenhavn (Copenhagen).
18.84 Tantalum is important because it combines high ductility and
exceptional corrosion resistance with a very high melting point. In the pure
state tantalum is corrosion resistant to most acids and alkalis. Since, when
pure, it is also very ductile, it is used in acid-proof equipment in chemical
plant. Being impervious to acid attack, sections as thin as 0.3 mm can be
used in heat-transfer equipment. It is used in the form of plugs to repair
damage to vitreous lined steel tanks in distilleries and chemical plant.
Not only is pure tantalum unreactive towards animal fluids but it also
provides a surface upon which tissue will grow. Consequently, it is used in
bone surgery, plates to replace skull tissue and for other 'implants' in the
human body. Woven tantalum gauze is used as a reinforcement to the
abdominal wall in some hernia operations.
Tantalum can be anodically treated (21.91) and the film so formed is very
stable and self-sealing. Moreover, this oxide film has excellent dielectric
properties and, being impervious to electrolytes used, has made tantalum
a very useful metal for the manufacture of very small sized electrolytic
capacitors. Foil of the order of 0.012 mm thick can be produced resulting
in electrolytic capacitors about one-tenth of the volume of ordinary alu-
minium-foil capacitors of equivalent capacitance. These small tantalum-foil
capacitors are widely used in modern electronic circuitry.
In modern engineering tantalum alloys (Table 18.9) are used for steam-
turbine blades, valves, nozzles, stills, agitators, containers and pipes in
chemical industries; and for the tips of fountain-pen nibs. Its minerals are
mined principally in Central and Southern Africa, Australia and Portugal.
Though generally assumed to be a 'new' metal the presence of tantalum
was first detected early in the nineteenth century. Because of the great
difficulty in isolating it from its minerals the metal was named after Tanta-
lus, son of Zeus, of Greek mythology. It was Tantalus who, for his alleged
crimes, was stood in water up to his chin but as he attempted to drink the
water always receded—hence to 'tantalize'. Although it was detected so
early, a hundred years passed before the pure metal was isolated in 1905.
18.85 Niobium was first discovered near Connecticut in 1801 by a
British chemist named Hatchett. In recognition of its source he called it
'columbium'. At about the same time Ekeburg in Sweden discovered a
'new' metal in close association with tantalum, and when later, in 1844, it
was isolated from tantalum by Rose he appropriately named it 'niobium'
after the sad Niobe, daughter of Tantalus. Soon afterwards 'columbium'
and 'niobium' were identified as being the same metal, but the two names
continued to be used on their respective sides of the Atlantic until some
years ago, by international agreement, the name 'niobium' was officially
adopted. Niobium was first produced in quantity in 1929 and has for a
considerable time been used as a 1.0% addition to 18-8 stainless steels in
which it induces resistance to 'weld decay' (20.93).
Like zirconium, niobium has a low neutron absorption. Moreover it has

a very high melting point (2468°C) suggesting that it would be useful for
nuclear-fuel sheathing where higher reactor temperatures are involved.
Unfortunately niobium also reacts with the pile gases, as well as with other
substances with which it is likely to come into contact in the reactor, at
temperatures in excess of 5000C. However some of the alloys of niobium
have very good resistance to oxidation and a number (Table 18.9) are used
for high-temperature applications.
18.86 Cobalt is second only to iron in terms of its strong ferromagnetic
properties and finds use in permanent magnet alloys (14.30). It is also
important as a constituent of super high-speed steels and as the binding
matrix in some cemented carbide tool materials (14.20).
Although the corrosion-resistance of pure cobalt is poor that of some of
its alloys is excellent, particularly at high temperatures. Most of these
alloys are difficult to work and are therefore shaped by investment casting
(5.40—Pt.2). They have good high-temperature strength. 'FSX.414' (52Co;
29.5Cr; 10.5Ni; 7W; 0.25C; 0.01B) is used for gas-turbine vanes; whilst
'MAR-M322' (60Co; 21.5Cr; 9W; 4.5Ta; 2.25Zr; IC; 0.75Ti) is an invest-
ment casting alloy for jet-engine blades. 'NAS Co-W-Re' (67Co; 25W;
3Cr; 2Re; IZr; ITi; 0.4C) has a rupture strength of 45N/mm2 at 13000C
for 1000 hours and is used for high-temperature space applications.
Whilst the current tendency is towards the development of plastics
materials and ceramics for surgical purposes because of their greater chemi-
cal inactivity, some cobalt-base alloys are used in orthopaedic implants. A
popular cast alloy contains 65% cobalt, 28% chromium, 6% molybdenum

10% nickel, 0.1% carbon and the balance cobalt. However even with alloys
of the highest corrosion resistance some interaction may occur with the
surrounding tissue, releasing potentially toxic substances.
18.90 As more becomes known of the rarer and more elusive of the metallic
elements so are their properties exploited. Thus metals like yttrium (Table
18.5), samarium and strontium (Table 14.3) now find use in engineering
alloys, whilst another 'rare earth' neodymium is used in a new generation
of permanent magnets (14.30) as well as in the colouring of glass and the
manufacture of some capacitors. Yet another 'rare earth', praseodymium,
along with cerium, is used in the decolourising of some optical glasses,
whilst lanthanum is used in high refractive index glasses. As long ago as
the 1960s europium and yttrium compounds were developed for the coating
of TV screens, whilst during the same period the nuclear energy pro-
gramme was interested in europium, samarium, gadolinium and dys-
prosium as high neutron cross-section materials. The high thermal stability
of cerium and yttrium hydrides led to their use as neutron moderators in
atomic piles. In the field of medicine even the man-made element tech-
netium (with a half-life of only a few hours) is used as a radioactive isotope.

The Surface Hardening
of Steels
19.10 The service conditions of many steel components such as cams,
gears and shafts make it necessary for them to possess both hard, wear-
resistant surfaces and at the same time, tough, shock-resistant cores. In
plain carbon steels these two different sets of properties exist only in alloys
of different carbon content. A low-carbon steel, containing approximately
0.1% carbon, will be tough but soft, whilst a high-carbon steel of 0.8% or
more carbon will be hard when suitably heat-treated but will also be rela-
tively brittle.
19.11 The situation can best be met by employing a low-carbon steel
with suitable core properties and then causing either carbon or nitrogen to
penetrate to a regulated depth to produce a potentially hard surface skin;
as in the principal surface-hardening processes of carburising and nitriding.
Alternatively, a medium-carbon steel can be used, heat-treated first to
produce desirable core properties and local hardness at the surface then
introduced by one of the flame-hardening or induction-hardening pro-
cesses. In the first case the hardenable material is localised, whilst in the
second case it is the heat-treatment itself which is localised.
Rapid penetration of the surface of steel can only be effective if the
solute element dissolves interstitially. This is the case with the elements
used, viz. carbon, nitrogen and, to a small extent, boron. Once dissolved,
the elements increase the hardness of the surface by forming interstitial
compounds—carbides, nitrides or borides.
Case-hardening
19.20 The principles of case-hardening were used centuries ago in the
conversion of wrought iron to steel by the 'cementation' process. Both this
ancient process and case-hardening make use of the fact that carbon will
19

diffuse into iron provided that the latter is in the FCC (y) form which exists
above 9100C. Thus carburising consists in surrounding the component with
suitable carbonaceous material and heating it to above its upper critical
temperature for long enough to produce a carbon-enriched layer of suf-
ficient depth.
Solid, liquid and gaseous carburising media are used. The nature and
scope of the work involved will govern which medium it is best to employ.
The function of the carburising medium is to release atoms of carbon at
the surface of the work piece so that, at the carburising temperature, they
will be absorbed interstitially into the steel.
The rate at which the released carbon atoms diffuse beneath the surface
of the work piece is governed by Fick's Law (8.25):
J = SV-JT
dx
where / = the amount of carbon which passes in unit time across area S
in a plane normal to the 'JC' axis;
— 
= the variation of carbon content with depth below the surface
"x 
(the concentration gradient of the carbon);
D 
= the diffusion coefficient of carbon in y-iron.
D is very dependent upon temperature but in this instance is of the order
of 10~7 cm2/s at the carburising temperature (9000C).
From the Diffusion Equation (8.25):
dt 
dx2
the depth of carbon penetration could be derived using one of the standard
methods for solving differential equations. However, a simple formula
(13.84—Pt.2), derived originally by Einstein from mathematical studies of
diffusion, can be applied:
x = y/{2Di)
where D = the diffusion coefficient (cm2/s);
and 
t = time of diffusion (s).
This can be written:
Case depth = kyjt
where k = V5D and gives a rough estimate of the time required to produce
a case of given depth.
A very rough estimate of the depth of case may be made from a fractured
section of a test piece carburised along with the work but a more accurate
measurement may be made metallographically. A cross section of the test
piece is polished and etched and its image projected on to the screen of a

of case is 1.7mm, assuming a minimum hardness of 550 Hv.
camera microscope at known magnification. The depth of case can then
be measured on the screen image using a rule. Some specifications quote
a hardness index as indicating the limit of the useful case. Thus Fig. 19.1
represents a specification in which a hardness value of 55OHV is judged to
coincide with the limit of the useful case—in this instance a case depth of
1.7 mm.
19.21 Carburising in Solid Media Tack-carburising' as it is usually
called, involves packing the work into heat-resisting steel (25Cr; 20Ni)
boxes along with the carburising material so that a space of approximately
50 mm exists between the components. Small-scale work may be carried
out in mild-steel boxes but in either case the lids must fit tightly or be
luted' on with fireclay. The boxes are then heated slowly to the carburising
temperature (875-925°C) and maintained at this temperature for up to
eight hours, according to the depth of case required. Fig. 19.2 indicates
the relationship which exists between depth of case, carburising tempera-
ture and time of treatment.

Fig. 19.2 The relationship between time and temperature of carburising and the depth of

Although a solid carbon-rich medium is packed around the work the
actual carburising process depends upon the presence of the gas carbon
monoxide, CO, to carry carbon to the surface of the work pieces. Oxygen
in entrapped air forms this carbon monoxide:
2C + O2 -> 2CO
At the surface of the work piece this carbon monoxide releases carbon
atoms:
2CO -> CO2 + C
The carbon atoms so released are dissolved interstitially at the surface of
the steel.
As indicated above, charcoal alone could be used as the carburising
medium but in practice the rate of carburisation is increased by adding
an 'energiser', usually 10-15% barium carbonate. This dissociates at the
carburising temperature:
BaCO3 -> BaO + CO2
and the carbon dioxide thus produced reacts with charcoal to form carbon
monoxide:
CO2 + C ^± 2CO
The above reaction is reversible and as the temperature is increased, pres-
sure remaining constant, the proportion of carbon monoxide increases and
so therefore does the rate of carburisation (Fig. 19.2). In commercially
produced carburising media charcoal may be replaced by other carbon-rich
substances such as petroleum coke.
If it is necessary to prevent any areas of the component from being
carburised, this can be achieved by electro-plating these areas with copper
to a thickness of 0.075-0.10 mm; carbon being insoluble in solid copper
at the carburising temperature. An alternative method, which can be more
conveniently applied in small-scale treatment, is to coat the area with a
mixture of fireclay and ignited asbestos made into a paste with water. This
is allowed to dry on the surface before the component is carburised.
When carburising is complete the components are quenched or cooled
slowly in the box, according to the nature of the subsequent heat-treatment
to be applied.
19.22 Carburising in a Liquid Bath Liquid-carburising is carried out
in fused mixtures of salts containing from 20 to 50% sodium cyanide,
together with up to 40% sodium carbonate and varying amounts of sodium
or barium chloride. This cyanide-rich mixture is melted in 'calorised'
(21.84) pots to a temperature of 870-9500C and the work, which is con-
tained in wire baskets, is immersed for periods varying from about five
minutes up to one hour, depending upon the depth of case required. One

of the main advantages of cyanide-hardening is that pyrometric control is
so much more satisfactory with a liquid bath. Moreover, after treatment
the basket of work can be quenched. This not only produces the necessary
hardness but also gives a clean surface to the components. The process is
particularly useful in obtaining shallow cases of 0.10-0.25 mm, though
case depths up to 0.5 mm are used. Salt-bath carburising is used mainly
for small parts requiring a shallow case depth. It is an economical process
since the rate of heating is rapid due to the high heat-capacity of the liquid
bath and the quick transfer of heat to the work. This reduces the total time
of treatment.
It is believed that sodium cyanide, NaCN, is oxidised at the surface of
the molten bath:
The sodium cyanate, NaCNO, thus formed diffuses into the bath and
decomposes at the surface of the steel:
dissolves in steel
The carbon atoms dissolve interstitially in steel as they do in pack carburis-
ing, but in this process they are accompanied by nitrogen (which is released
in the suitable atomic form). Nitrogen also increases the hardness of the
case by forming nitrides as it does in the nitriding process (19.40).
Cyanides are, of course, extremely poisonous, and every precaution
must be taken to avoid inhaling the fumes from a pot. Every pot should
be fitted with an efficient fume-extracting hood. Likewise the salts should
in no circumstances be allowed to come into contact with an open wound.
Needless to say, the consumption of food by operators whilst working in
the shop containing the cyanide pots should be absolutely forbidden. Dis-
posal of cyanide wastes is also a problem. Effluents containing even small
quantities of cyanides will destroy bacteria used in purifying sewage, conse-
quently the disposal of these wastes must be rigorously controlled.
19.23 Gas Carburising is carried out in both batch-type and continu-
ous furnaces (13.20—Pt. 2) and in recent years has become by far the most
popular method for mass-production carburising, particularly when thin
cases are required. Not only is it a cleaner process but the necessary plant
is also more compact for a given output. Moreover the carbon content of
the case can be controlled more accurately and easily than in either 'solid'
or 'liquid' carburising.
The work is heated at about 9000C for three to four hours in an atmos-
phere containing gases which will deposit carbon atoms by decomposition
at the work piece surfaces. This atmosphere is generally based on the
hydrocarbons methane ('natural gas') CH4; and propane, C3 H8, which are
either partially burnt in the furnace or are diluted with a 'carrier' gas in

order to produce an atmosphere giving the required carbon potential at
the work surface. This carbon potential is in practice the carbon content
maintained in equilibrium in the surface film of the component whilst it is
in contact with the gas atmosphere. A carbon potential of 0.8% is usually
desirable (19.24). Carrier gases are generally of the 'endothermic' type
made in a generator and consisting of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and

carbon monoxide. The active agent in the atmosphere is carbon monoxide
as it is in so-called 'solid' carburising:
2CO ^ CO2 + C (at the work surface) 
(1)
The atomic carbon thus released dissolves interstitially in the surface of
the austenitic work pieces. Methane present in the atmosphere probably
also releases carbon atoms:
CH4 ^ 2H2 + C (at work surface) 
(2)
The 'water gas reaction' may also be responsible for carburising:
CO + H2 ^± H2O + C (at work surface) 
(3)
Carbon dioxide formed in (1) probably reacts with methane:
CO2 + CH4 ^ 2H2 + 2CO (away from the work surface) 
(4)
The concentration of carbon monoxide is thus maintained so that carburis-
ing continues.
The relative proportions of hydrocarbon and carrier are adjusted to give
the desired carburising rate. Thus, the concentration gradient of carbon in
the surface can be flattened by prolonged treatment in a less rich carburis-
ing atmosphere. Control of this type is possible only with gaseous media.
There are a number of different methods by which the composition of the
carburising atmosphere can be continually monitored, so that the carbon
potential can be accurately controlled.
At present investigational work on 'plasma carburising' is taking place.
This is similar in principle to 'ionitriding' or 'ion implantation' (19.43)
but low-pressure nitrogen is replaced by low-pressure hydrocarbons. This
process, if successfully developed, would lead to a big saving of natural
gas. It is claimed that a case of one millimetre depth can be produced in
thirty minutes.
19.24 Heat-treatment after Carburising If carburising has been cor-
rectly carried out, the core will still be of low carbon content (0.1-0.2%
carbon), whilst the case should preferably have a carbon content of no
more than 0.8% C (the eutectoid composition). If the carbon content of
the case is higher than this then a network of primary cementite will
coincide with the grain-boundary sites of the original austenite giving rise
to intercrystalline brittleness and consequent exfoliation (or peeling) of the
case during service. Even if this does not occur any cracks arising from the
presence of primary cementite may initiate fatigue failure. Moreover a
case containing 1.0% or more carbon may be soft at the surface after
quenching due to retention of austenite.
After the component has been carburised heat-treatment will be neces-
sary both to strengthen and toughen the core and to harden the case. At
the same time prolonged heating in the austenitic range during carburising

will have introduced coarse grain to the whole structure, so that a heat-
treatment programme which will also refine the grain is desirable if the
optimum properties are to be attained. For components which have been
pack- or liquid-carburised to produce deep cases, a double heat-treatment
is preferable to refine both core and case separately, as well as to harden
the case and strengthen the core.
19.25 Refining the Core The component is first heat-treated with the
object of refining the grain of the core and consequently toughening it.
This is effected by heating it to just above its upper critical temperature
(about 8800C for the core) when the coarse ferrite/pearlite structure will
be replaced by fine austenite crystals. The component is then water-
quenched so that a fine ferrite/bainite/martensite structure is obtained in
the core.
The core-refining temperature of 8800C is, however, still high above the
upper critical temperature for the case, so that, at the quenching tempera-
ture, the case may consist of large austenite grains. On quenching these
will result in the formation of coarse brittle martensite. Further treatment
of the case is therefore necessary.
19.26 Refining the Case The component is now heated to about
7600C, so that the coarse martensite of the case changes to fine-grained
austenite. Quenching then gives a fine-grained martensite in the case.
At the same time the martensite produced in the core by the initial
quench will be tempered somewhat, and much will be reconverted into
fine-grained austenite embedded in the ferrite matrix (point C in Fig.
19.3). The second quench will produce a structure in the core consisting of
martensite particles embedded in a matrix of ferrite grains surrounded by
bainite. The amount of martensite in the core is reduced if the component
is heated quickly through the range 650-7600C and then quenched without
soaking. This produces a core structure consisting largely of ferrite and
bainite, and having increased toughness and shock-resistance.

Heat-treatment after carburising.
'A' indicates the temperature of treatment for the core and 'B' the temperature of treatment
for the case.

Finally, the component is tempered at between 1600C and 2200C to re-
lieve any quenching strains present in the case.
19.27 The above comprehensive heat-treatment may be regarded as
the counsel of perfection and would be that applied to important
components in which cases of considerable depth had been produced and
in which the necessarily prolonged carburising cycle had given rise to coarse
grain. The core-refining process would also cause some reduction in the
high carbon content at the skin to a more acceptable value nearer 0.8%,
thus reducing the chance of primary cementite networks at the surface. For
thinner cases and lower quality work generally, modified heat-treatment is
prevalent.
When thin cases (below 0.5 mm) are involved the component may be
quenched direct from the carburising process with obvious advantages
economically. The shorter carburising time will not have produced grain
growth to the same extent as more prolonged treatment. With cases of
intermediate thickness (0.5-1.25 mm) a component may be cooled slowly
from the carburising temperature and given a single treatment by re-
heating to 8200C as a compromise between the upper and lower critical
temperatures (for the core), water-quenched and finally tempered at
between 1600C and 2200C. The case will then be hard though slightly
coarse-grained whilst the core will consist of a ferrite/bainite/martensite
structure. The ferrite will be rather coarse-grained, remaining from the
original carburising and will not be completely redissolved by heating to
8200C. Hence the core will not attain maximum toughness.
Gas carburising gives greater flexibility in heat-treatment. Thus the
actual carburising process may be carried out at 900-9400C to give a carbon
content at the surface of 0.8%. When carburising is complete the furnace
temperature can be lowered to 8300C and the work then quenched direct
(Fig. 13.7—Pt. 2).
Case-hardening Steels
19.30 Plain Carbon Steels used for case-hardening commonly contain
up to 0.2% carbon when maximum toughness and ductility of the core are
required. When higher core strength is necessary the carbon content may
be raised to 0.3%, though it is generally more satisfactory to use an alloy
steel in such circumstances.
Up to 1.4% manganese may be included since it aids carburisation by
stabilising cementite. It also increases the depth of hardening but is liable
to induce cracking during quenching. Silicon tends to graphitise cementite
and, since it retards carburisation, is kept below 0.35%. Thus plain carbon
steels used for case-hardening contain up to 0.3% carbon and up to 1.4%
manganese.
19.31 Alloy Steels for case-hardening contain, additionally, up to
4.5Ni; 1.5Cr; and 0.3Mo. Higher core-strength without serious loss of
either toughness or ductility are obtained by alloying. Moreover, since the

critical hardening rates are reduced oil quenching can be used to minimise
the risk of distortion or cracking.
An important function of nickel is to retard grain growth during carburis-
ing and so give a comparatively fine-grained product. For this reason the
core-refining stage in heat-treatment can be dispensed with in some appli-
cations of case-hardened nickel steels with obvious economic advantage,
though this is generally restricted to those in which only a light case has
been produced and in which the presence of a cementite network is
unlikely.
Although nickel retards carburisation and tends to give a softer case
than some plain carbon steels, the case is very wear resistant. Cracking
and exfoliation are also less likely. The addition of chromium increases
hardness and wear-resistance of the case and also stability of the cementite.
It also improves strength of the core with little loss in ductility. Neverthe-
less chromium additions have to be limited because of the tendency of the
metal to promote grain growth with its consequent loss of toughness.
Nitriding
19.40 Nitriding resembles carburising in so far as interstitial penetration
of the solid surface of steel takes place during heating of the work in
contact with the nitriding agent. Whilst in carburising the function of the
carburising agent is to release atoms of carbon at the steel surface, in
nitriding the nitriding agent releases single atoms of nitrogen at the steel
surface so that, in this instance, hardness depends on the formation of hard
nitrides instead of carbides. Whilst it is possible to nitride many types of
steel, high surface hardness is only obtained when using special alloy steels
containing aluminium, chromium, molybdenum or vanadium—elements
which form hard and stable nitrides as soon as they come into contact with
nitrogen atoms at the surface of the work piece.
Fig. 11.7 indicates that iron dissolves up to 0.1% nitrogen at 5900C and
that above this amount it begins to form the hard nitride Fe4N (y'). This
underlines a very important difference between carburising and nitriding.
Whilst carburising must take place when mild steel is in its austenitic state
at about 9000C, nitriding can be achieved with the work in its ferritic state
at about 5000C.
19.41 Since it is conducted at a relatively low temperature, nitriding
is made the final operation in the manufacture of the component, all
machining and core-treatment processes having been carried out pre-
viously. The parts are maintained at 5000C for between 40 and 100 hours,
according to the depth of case required, in a gas-tight chamber through
which ammonia is allowed to circulate. Some of the ammonia dissociates
according to the following equation:

DEPTH OF CASE (mm)
Fig. 19.4 The depth of nitriding for a 1% Al steel (905M39) in relation to time of nitriding
at 5000C.
Part of the nitrogen, which is released as single atoms, is absorbed by the
surface of the steel forming nitrides both with iron and with the elements
mentioned above.
Nitriding of plain carbon steels would produce a case of only moderate
hardness (about 400 //v). This is largely because nitrogen diffuses fairly
quickly beneath the surface forming Fe4N (and so netimes Fe2N) dispersed
at greater depths so that surface hardness is reduced. Since aluminium—
and to a lesser extent chromium, vanadium and molybdenum—has a higher
affinity for nitrogen it prevents diffusion of the latter to a greater depth
but instead forms very hard stable aluminium nitride near the surface,
giving an extremely hard but shallow case up to 1.0 mm in depth. Chro-
mium also helps to increase case hardness by the formation of chromium
nitride. Since it forms at a greater depth than does aluminium nitride it
prevents a sudden change in composition from hardened skin to soft core
which would be likely to lead to spalling, or flaking, of the case. In addition
to hardening the case, molybdenum also improves core toughness.

ALLOYING ELEMENT (°/o)
Fig. 19.5 The influence of alloying elements on the hardness of 'Nitralloy' type steels after
nitriding.
In each case the steel contains 0.3% C and 0.65% Mn. The effect of nickel is slight because
it does not form nitrides and such increase in hardness as is obtained is due only to solid
solution effects.

When core strength is important aluminium is often omitted from the
steel and a somewhat lower case hardness obtained, dependent upon the
formation of chromium and vanadium nitrides (Fig. 19.5).
19.42 Before being nitrided the work is heat-treated to produce the
required core properties. The normal sequence of operations is:
(a) oil-quenching from 850-9300C, followed by tempering at 550-
7000C depending upon the composition of the steel and the core proper-
ties required;
(b) rough-machining, followed by a stabilising anneal at 5500C for five
hours to remove stresses initiated by the cold-work;
(c) finish-machining, followed by nitriding at 490-5200C.
Any parts of the component which are required soft are protected by
coating with a mixture of whiting and sodium silicate.
19.43 lonitriding The concept and principles of ionitriding (ion-
nitriding)—also known as 'plasma nitriding' and 'ion implantation'—were
first established as long ago as the early nineteen-thirties but only in recent
years has the process become commercially established. The principles of
ionitriding are similar to those of ion-plating (21.86) in that ions of the
coating substance are attracted to the surface being coated. The work is
made the cathode in a chamber containing nitrogen under near-vacuum
conditions (1-10 m bar). Under a potential difference of 500-1000 volts
(dc) the low-pressure nitrogen becomes ionised and the N + + + ions so
produced are accelerated towards the negatively-charged work load where,
on impact, they penetrate the surface of the steel. The kinetic energy of
the ions is converted to heat so that the surface is quickly raised to the
nitriding temperature (400-6000C). The work load is completely sur-
rounded by a glow of ionised nitrogen so that uniform treatment is assured.
Depending upon the type of steel and the depth of case required treatment
times range from ten minutes to thirty hours. After treatment the load can
be cooled under low pressure to prevent oxidation and also avoid the risk
of distortion.
The degree of control is superior to that in other nitriding processes and
the properties of the case can be effectively adjusted by alterations in
the conditions of working. Maximum hardness in 'nitralloy-type' steels is
achieved at a treatment temperature of 4500C. The higher the alloy content
the thinner and harder the case since nitrides are formed near to the surface
when aluminium is present.
Ionitriding is already widely used abroad and the throughput of an instal-
lation is about three times that of a comparable orthodox gas-nitriding
plant. The process is currently being used to nitride components as large
as 14 tonnes in mass down to the tiny balls of ball-point pens. Truck engine
crankshafts and other automobile parts, as well as hot- and cold-working
tools and dies are being ionitrided.
19.44 The Advantages of Nitriding 
are, briefly, as follows:
(i) Since no quenching is required after nitriding, cracking or distor-

tion are unlikely and components can be machine-finished before
treatment.
(ii) A very high surface hardness of 1150 Hv is obtained with 'Nitral-
loy' steels containing aluminium.
(iii) Resistance to corrosion is good, particularly if the nitrided surface
is left unpolished.
(iv) Resistance to fatigue failure is good.
(v) Hardness is retained to 5000C whereas in a carburised component
hardness begins to fall at about 2000C.
(vi) The process is economical when large numbers of components are
to be treated.
(vii) It is a very 'clean' process compared with cyanide-bath treatment
where work must be rinsed to remove toxic salts. Such rinsing water,
which must be disposed of, constitutes a threat to the environment.
19.45 The Disadvantages of Nitriding as compared with case-
hardening are:
(a) The initial outlay for plant is higher than with case-hardening, so
that the process is economical only when large numbers of components
are to be treated.
(b) If the nitrided component is accidentally overheated the surface
hardness will be lost completely, and the component must be nitrided
again. A case-hardened component would only need to be heat-treated
again (unless heating had been so excessive as to cause decarburisation).
19.46 Carbonitriding is a surface-hardening process in which both
carbon and nitrogen are absorbed into the surface of the steel, nitrogen
further increasing the hardness of the carburised layer. Although salt-bath
carburising (19.22) also achieves this result, the term 'carbonitriding' is
used to describe a process in which gaseous media are used. Treatment
takes place at 800-8750C in a carbon monoxide/hydrocarbon atmosphere
to which has been added 3% to 8% ammonia. The relative proportions
of carbon and nitrogen dissolved may be controlled by varying both the
concentration of ammonia and the temperature.
Since the steel must be in its austenitic condition to permit rapid solution
of carbon this is in turn relatively unfavourable to the solution of nitrogen
which dissolves fifty times more quickly in ferrite than it does in austenite.
Nevertheless, solution of nitrogen in austenite is still considerable provided
that the treatment temperature is kept below 9000C since the solubility of
nitrogen in austenite falls as the temperature rises for a given concentration
of ammonia.
The presence of more than 0.2% nitrogen, along with 0.8% carbon
in the case, slows down transformation rates so that oil-quenching may
sometimes be used to harden the case. However, the Ms temperature is
also considerably reduced by the presence of more than 0.4% nitrogen so
that large quantities of retained austenite may be present in the case after
quenching. Nevertheless carbonitriding imparts increased hardenability
and wear resistance compared with ordinary case-hardening.

Surface Hardening by Localised Heat-treatment
19.50 In these processes both core and case are of the same composition
and it is the heat-treatment which is localised. Since the case must contain
sufficient carbon to render it hardenable these treatments are applied to
medium carbon steels containing 0.35-0.5% carbon. Low-alloy steels con-
taining up to 1.0% chromium with, sometimes, 0.25% molybdenum and
0.5% nickel are also used and the processes are particularly suited to the
treatment of components such as gear wheels, splined shafts and spindles
where only limited areas need be hardened. The compressive stresses
induced in the hardened surface layers improve the fatigue strength of the
component.
The component as a whole is first heat-treated by quenching and temper-
ing (or sometimes simply normalising) in order to achieve the necessary
core properties. Its surface is then austenitised by being heated locally and
immediately quenched to produce a hard martensitic structure. Thus the
carbon content of the component is constant at about 0.4% throughout,
but whilst the core structure will be tempered martensite (or ferrite/pearl-
ite) that of the case will be martensite. Core and case will generally be
separated by a 'cushion layer' of bainite which considerably reduces the
risk of spalling.
Two methods of surface heating are available:
19.51 Flame Hardening 
In this process the surface is heated by a gas
flame derived from ethine (acetylene), propane or natural gas. Manually-
operated torches are useful in treating small areas or localised surfaces
such as the cutting edge of a blanking tool or the tip of a screw. As soon
as the area has become austenitic the whole component is water-quenched.
For the progressive hardening of larger areas a gas torch with built-in water
jets can be used. The torch passes over the surface slowly enough to ensure
its austenitisation and the water jets, following closely behind the flame,
effect quenching.
Symmetrical components such as gears and shafts can be spun between
centres within a ring burner. The work piece rotates quite slowly at about
one revolution per second and as soon as the surface has reached its austen-
itic state it is quenched either by complete immersion in a bath or by water
jets built into the burner ring. For the progressive surface hardening of
long shafts a gas ring burner combined with a water-spraying system can
be used.
19.52 Induction Hardening 
is similar in principle to flame hardening
in that only the surface is austenitised prior to being quenched. Heating
of the surface is achieved by surrounding the component with an inductor
coil carrying a high-frequency alternating current (in the range 2-500 kHz).
The smaller the work pieces the higher the frequency used since this results
in a shallower depth of penetration of the heated zone.
When an electric current passes through a coil a magnetic field surrounds
the coil (Fig. 19.6 (i)) and a steel bar introduced into the field will carry a
magnetic flux. Since the magnetic flux in this case is created by a high-

frequency alternating current, 'eddy currents' are produced in the surface
layers of the steel bar which consequently become heated (Fig. 19.6 (ii)).
Additional heating is produced in the case of steel by hysteresis losses and
the surface usually reaches its upper critical temperature in a few seconds.
Since the copper coil tends to become heated by radiation from the work
piece it is usually in the form of a tube which can be cooled by internal
water flow.
As soon as the surface has reached the required temperature the
component is quenched either by dropping it into a quenching bath or by
lowering it automatically into a water spray. Long shafts, axles and similar
components are hardened progressively by passing them through an induc-
tor block which carries its own quenching spray attached to the block (Fig.
19.6 (Hi)). The component is usually rotated to ensure even heating of
the surface. Selective localised surface hardening is achieved by using an
inductor 'probe' (Fig. 19.6 (iv)). In such cases hardening is usually attained
by air cooling.
Fig. 19.6 
The principles of induction hardening.
Friction Surfacing
19.60 This surface hardening process, known as Friesurfacing, is a deriva-
tive of friction welding (20.67). The principles of the process are indicated
inFig.19.7.
The coating material in rod form is rotated under pressure against the
surface to be coated so that a hot plastic layer is generated at the interface
of the rod and the substrate. By moving the work piece across the face of
the rotating rod a layer some 1-2 mm thick is produced. The surface of
the coating is characterised by ripples but only 0.1 mm needs to be
machined off after coating. During the coating cycle the applied layer
reaches a temperature about 400C below its melting point and severe plastic
deformation ensures a uniform fine-grained microstructure as recrystallis-
ation ensues.
19.61 Many of the hard wear-resistant alloys currently available can be
deposited in this way. These include tool steels, high-speed steels and

cobalt-based Stellites. The method of deposition ensures a structure of
finely divided carbides in a matrix of martensite which is formed as a result
of the fairly rapid cooling which prevails in the substrate as heat is extracted
by the cold work piece. Consequently a tempering process may be neces-
sary or, in the case of high-speed steel, a secondary hardening treatment.

Metallurgical Principles
of the Joining of Metals
20.10 Apart from purely mechanical methods such as riveting the chief
methods available for joining metals are soldering, brazing, welding or the
use of resin-based adhesives. Industrial applications of these processes are
many and varied and range from the soldering of sardine cans to the
fabrication by welding of mass-produced ships by Henry J. Kaiser during
the Second World War. Indeed the enormous progress in welding tech-
niques since then has led to the replacement of riveted joints in steel
structures by welded ones for almost every application. Modern welding
produces a joint which saves up to 15% of the mass of the structure as
compared with riveting. Moreover the joint is free from gaps and crevices
and is easier to maintain by surface coating. The development of welding
has made possible the replacement of many of the larger iron castings by
weldments, resulting in tougher, lighter and sounder structures. At the
same time it must be admitted that the relatively high labour costs, associ-
ated with welding and its allied processes, have led in recent years to the
development of a host of metal fastening devices such as self-piercing
rivets, self-clinching captive fasteners, thread-forming screws, toggle
latches and pop-rivets which in many cases will provide an inexpensive
alternative to a continuous metallic joint.
In soldering, brazing or welding complete or incipient fusion takes place
at the surfaces of the two pieces of metal being joined so that a more or
less continuous crystal structure exists as we pass across the region of the
joint. Soldering and brazing are fundamentally similar processes in that
the joining material always melts at a temperature which is lower than
that of the work pieces, but the distinction between the two processes is
imprecise. However, it is generally agreed that soldering—or soft soldering
as it is often called—can be described as a process in which temperatures
below 4500C are involved, whereas brazing temperatures are generally
between 6000C and 9000C. Included in the brazing processes are hard
soldering or silver soldering, terms tending to proliferate confusion.
20

20.11 In the most ancient welding operation—that used by the black-
smith—the two pieces of metal are hammered together whilst at a high
temperature, so that crystal growth occurs across the surfaces in contact,
thus knitting the halves firmly together. A welding process of this type
was probably used by Tubal Cain. By the time the Parthenon was being
constructed in Ancient Greece, on the initiative of Pericles, between 447
and 438 BC, welding played an important part in civil engineering. In the
Parthenon the marble blocks used were not joined by mortar but by a
system of iron dowels and double T-shaped clamps. Metallographic exam-
ination of surviving specimens has shown that the latter were made by
welding the feet of two T-shaped pieces of iron together.
Soldering
20.20 A solder must be capable of 'wetting', that is, alloying with, the
metals to be joined and at the same time have a freezing range appreciably
lower so that the work itself is in no danger of fusion or deterioration of
mechanical properties. The mechanical strength of the solder must also be
adequate though it is often necessary to overlap workpieces considerably
so that a joint of sufficient strength is obtained.
20.21 Alloys based on tin or lead fulfil most of these requirements for
a wide range of metallurgical materials which need to be joined, since tin
will alloy readily with iron and steel, copper and its alloys, nickel and
its alloys and lead. At the same time tin-lead alloys possess mechanical
toughness, and melt at temperatures between 183°C and 2500C, which is
comfortably below the point at which deterioration in properties of the
metals to be joined will take place. Those metals which coat themselves
with a tenacious oxide skin are very difficult to solder. This is true of
aluminium though some success is possible if a suitable flux and a tin-zinc
solder are used. Zinc-base die-casting alloys containing aluminium are
difficult to solder for the same reason, whilst the extremely dense oxide
films on titanium and tantalum make them impossible to solder.
Solders are of two main types depending upon the freezing range
required. Thus in the electronics industries and for the manufacture of tin
cans, motor-car radiators and the like, a 'tinman's solder' is required which
will solidify quickly over a narrow temperature range. Therefore an alloy
is used which is as near to the eutectic mixture (62Sn-38Pb) as economic
circumstances will allow, bearing in mind that the cost of tin is many times
that of lead. 'Best' tinman's solder solidifies over the range 183-185°C
whilst a cheaper compromise, 'coarse' tinman's solder (50Sn-50Pb) solidi-
fies over the range 183-2200C. An increased awareness of the poisonous
nature of lead has resulted in its prohibition for plumbing purposes. Tin-
lead solders too are outlawed for domestic plumbing, even for the joining
of copper pipes and fittings. Tin-silver solders or tin-copper alloys
(Table 20.1) are now employed instead. Although these alloys are used by
'plumbers'—perhaps they should now be called 'coppersmiths'—they are
not required to have the long freezing range of the original plumber's

LEAD {%>)

designations of solders within BS 219 (Table 20.1).
solder. On the contrary they should freeze over as short a range, and hence
as quickly, as possible in the manner of tinman's solder. For this reason
these lead-free solders are of approximately eutectic composition (Fig.
20.2). Nevertheless freezing ranges involved are some 400C higher than
for equivalent tin-lead solders. They are also more expensive.
Although lead plumbing has been replaced for domestic use by copper
or polythene, it is still often necessary to join lead pipes or cable-sheathing
and for this purpose 'plumber's' solder is used. This is a mixture containing
about 67% lead, and will consequently contain a mixture of liquid and
solid phases between 183°C and about 2500C. This extended range over
which the alloy will be in a pasty state is of advantage to the plumber,
since it enables him to wipe joints in lead piping, a feat which would be
almost impossible to accomplish with an alloy melting or freezing over a
small range of temperatures.

20,22 Solders are sometimes strengthened by the addition of small
amounts of antimony which, within the limits in which it is added, remains
in solid solution. When copper alloys are soldered it is always possible that
at some point in the joint the concentrations of copper and tin will be such

that one of the hard, brittle copper-tin intermetallic compounds, such as
CU31S118 or CusSn6 will be formed in sufficient quantity to cause brittleness
of the joint. This will be accentuated if the joint is subjected during service
to high temperatures, which, though below the melting point of the solder,
promote diffusion of copper and tin within the joint leading to an increase
in the amount of compound formed. Such a joint will tear through at the
interface containing these compounds revealing their characteristic bluish
colour. This difficulty can be overcome by soldering copper with an alloy
consisting of 97.5Pb-2.5Ag, for, whilst lead and copper are insoluble in
each other, silver alloys with each, and thus acts as a metallic bond between
the two without forming any brittle intermetallic compounds. A list of
representative solders is given in Table 20.1.
20.23 In order that the solder shall 'wet', or alloy with, the surfaces of
the work pieces, the latter must be clean and free from oxide film. Initial
cleaning may involve pickling or some form of mechanical abrasion of the
surface, but the thin layer of oxide which immediately forms on the cleaned
surface of most metals must be dissolved by a suitable flux during the
actual soldering process. The traditional soldering flux for iron and steel
was 'killed spirits of salts'—hydrochloric acid to which had been added
excess granulated zinc. Modern fluxes of this type contain zinc, ammonium,
sodium or tin chlorides either separately or together. Orthophosphoric
acid is a component of fluxes used for soldering stainless steel.
Whilst the above fluxes are very effective in action they leave behind a
corrosive deposit. It is often inconvenient or impossible to wash this off,
particularly in the case of electrical assemblies and some organic type of
flux is then preferable. These are generally organic acids such as lactic,
oleic or glutamic acids or their halogen compounds. Many of these volatil-
ise during soldering or are easily water-soluble. They can be used for
soldering steel, copper, brass and many electro-plated surfaces. For electri-
cal work—including modern electronics—rosin-based fluxes are used. The
least corrosive soldering flux is a solution of pure white rosin dissolved in
propanol-2.
20.24 The reader will be familiar with simple hand-soldering using a
'soldering iron' and flux-cored solder. Whilst this method is still useful,
mass production demands more sophisticated automatic methods. Thus,
the solder may be 'pre-placed' in the form of washers, rings, discs, pellets
or powder (generally a suspension in paste or liquid flux). The assembly,
along with the pre-placed solder and flux is then heated on a hot-plate, or
in some form of oven, or by high-frequency induction. Dip- or mass-
soldering is also used where the work pieces are brought into contact with
molten solder which also acts as the heat source. Printed-circuit soldering
generally involves a modified form of dip-soldering, known as 'wave-
soldering' in which the circuit board is passed over a wave-peak generated
in the molten solder bath (Fig. 20.3).
20.25 Diffusion Soldering The growth of the electronics industry has
generated a need for soldering processes in which thermal damage to the
workpiece is minimised. Such a process is diffusion soldering the elements
of which are shown in Fig. 20.4. Here the workpieces to be joined are

Fig. 20.4 
Diffusion soldering, (i) a thin tin foil is sandwiched between the silver-metallised
substrates; (ii) the tin foil melts and reacts with the silver film, forming Ag3Sn; (iii) Ag3Sn (m.

metallised* with silver and then separated by a thin layer of tin foil. The
assembly is then heated to 2500C so that the tin melts and begins to dissolve
the solid silver with which it reacts to form the intermetallic compound
Ag3Sn. Since Ag3Sn has a melting point of 4800C it begins to solidify, and
because the tin foil is thin compared with the silver layers it is soon used
up so that the joint solidifies completely. Continued heating at 2500C causes
the solid Ag3Sn and the remaining solid silver to diffuse into each other
more completely, so that Ag3Sn transforms to Ag5Sn (m.pt. 724°C) which
in turn transforms to a silver-tin solid solution with a melting range in
the region of 9000C.
Indium foil may be used instead of tin in which case a lower treatment
temperature of 175°C can be used (m.pt. of indium 156.60C). Here the
intermetallic compound AgIn2 is first formed, transforming to Ag2In and
ultimately to a solid solution with a freezing range in the region of 9000C.
Using diffusion soldering a joint can be made using lower temperatures
than those to which the device will be subjected in normal operation. Thus
expansion mismatch stresses can be kept very low, a useful feature for
example when joining a heat sink to a device.
Brazing
20.30 Metallurgically this process (17.80—Pt. 2) is similar to soldering in
that the filler metal melts and alloys with the solid work pieces. Brazing is
generally used where a tougher, stronger joint is required, provided that
* 'Metallising' involves coating some surface with metal by metal spraying, chemical or vacuum
deposition.

the work will be neither melted nor otherwise damaged by the higher
temperatures involved in melting the brazing solder. Most ferrous and
non-ferrous alloys of sufficiently high melting point can be brazed. A tra-
ditional borax-type flux is used for solders which melt above 7500C, but
below that temperature borax does not fuse readily and a mixture of borax
and metallic fluorides is employed. Fluoride-base fluxes are also useful
when brazing refractory materials, whilst alkali-halide fluxes are necessary
for brazing aluminium.
Probably fifty-per-cent of industrial brazing is still carried out using a
hand-held gas torch but mass production employs a wide range of heating
methods in conjunction with pre-placed brazing alloy and flux. Stationary
gas torches and batch or conveyor-hearth furnaces have been long estab-
lished. Electric methods involve high-frequency induction and interface
heating (Fig. 20.5), whilst superalloys are generally brazed in a near
vacuum.
Fig. 20.5 
The principles of resistance brazing by interface heating.
Ordinary brazing solder contains about 60Cu-40Zn. This would nor-
mally give a coarse Widmanstatten a + |3' structure, but during brazing
some of the zinc will volatilise and some may be absorbed by the work
pieces. The resultant joint will therefore be of a tough ductile a structure.
Higher-grade brazing compounds, or silver solders, contain up to 85%
silver and melt over lower temperature ranges. Special brazing alloys are
available for aluminium. Table 20.2 lists a few of the many brazing alloys
dealt with in BS 1845.
20.31 The brazing of silicon units in modern electronics can be carried
out using a brazing solder containing A1-12SL This is of eutectic compo-
sition (Fig. 17.2) and will also 'wet' silicon. If a lower brazing temperature
is required an aluminium-germanium brazing solder containing 53% ger-
manium is used and melts at 424°C. It alloys with silicon but has rather
poor fluidity which is improved by the addition of silver.

Welding
20.40 Some of the welding processes resemble both soldering and brazing
in so far as molten metal is applied to produce a joint between the two
pieces. However, in welding, the added metal is, more often than not, of
similar composition to the metals being joined, and a more positive state
of fusion exists at the metal surfaces. Thus, differences between the weld
metal and the pieces being joined are structural rather than compositional.
The method of production of a weld calls for rather different technique
to that employed in brazing and soldering. Since work pieces and filler
metal are of similar compositions the speed of working is particularly
important if fusion of the metal adjacent to the joint is to be avoided and
this calls for a high 'temperature gradient' in and around the weld. How-
ever, some welding processes rely on pressure to effect joining of the two
halves. In such cases no metal is added to form a joint, the weld metal
being provided by the two halves being joined. Thus we have both fusion
and solid-phase welding processes as indicated in Fig. 20.6.
Of recent years, welding has become one of the principal methods of
fabricating and repairing metal products. It is an economical means of
joining metals in almost all assembly processes and, assuming good welding

technique, produces a very dependable result. There are now over thirty
different welding methods available for specific applications so that it will
be possible to mention only the more important processes here. A fuller
description is given in Part 2.
Fusion Welding Processes
20.50 Either thermo-chemical sources, the electric arc or some form of
radiant energy can be used to melt the weld metal. In each case the equip-
ment must be capable of 'focusing' the high-energy heat source on to the
weld area.
20.51 Gas Methods In these processes the surfaces to be joined are
melted by the flame from a gas torch, the gases most commonly used
being suitable mixtures of oxygen and ethine (acetylene), which produce
temperatures up to 30000C. Such a high temperature will quickly melt all
the ordinary metals and alloys, and is necessary in order to overcome the
tendency of sheet metals to conduct heat away from the joint so quickly
that fusion cannot occur. Moreover, rapid melting will reduce distortion,
overheating and oxidation of the surrounding metal.
In gas- and other fusion-welding processes a welding rod, or filler rod,
is used to supply the necessary metal for the weld. The rod is held close
to the work and melted by the flame, so that molten metal flows into the
prepared joint between the pieces being welded. Since the edges of the
pieces also fuse, a strong, metallurgically continuous joint is formed. Weld-
ing rods usually have a composition similar to that of the metals being
welded, although in some cases they are richer in those elements which
tend to volatilise during welding. Gas welding is now used mainly for
jobbing and repair work in mild steel and carbon steels. The term 'bronze
welding' refers to the joining of metals with high melting points, such as
steel, cast iron, nickel and copper, by the use of a copper-alloy filler rod.
In gas welding the flame may be made oxidising, reducing or neutral but
with those alloys which oxidise easily, such as those containing aluminium,
some form of flux will be necessary. This is normally supplied as a coating
to the filler rod. The flux should melt at a lower temperature than the
metal being welded and thus dissolves oxide films which form before fusion
of the metal begins. As the molten flux coats the surface it also protects
the work from excessive oxidation.
20.52 Thermit Welding now finds only limited application, chiefly in
the repair of large iron and steel castings, though it was the traditional
method for joining rails on site. A mould is constructed around the parts
to be joined, and above this is placed sufficient thermit powder. The parts
to be welded are preheated and the powder then fired.
Thermit powder consists of an intimate mixture of powdered aluminium
and iron(III) oxide in molecular proportions. The iron(III) oxide is reduced
by aluminium to metallic iron:

The heat of the reaction is so intense that the iron formed melts and
runs down into the prepared mould, combining with the preheated surfaces
and producing a weld. Variations of the process can be used to join non-
ferrous cables on site.
20.53 Electric-arc Methods In the earliest of these processes an elec-
tric arc was struck between two carbon electrodes or between a carbon
electrode and the work itself. Filler metal was supplied to the arc separ-
ately. In modern processes the carbon electrode has been dispensed with
and the filler rod itself becomes the electrode.
20.53.1. The metallic arc process is by far the most popular method
(Fig.20.8(i)) of fusion welding. Basically it is similar to the carbon arc, but
the electrode is a metal rod of suitable composition which serves also as
the filler rod. The end of this rod melts and deposits on to the joint, whilst,
at the same time, the heat generated melts the edges of the work, producing
a continuous weld. The filler rod is usually coated with a suitable flux which
not only supplies the weld but also assists in stabilising the arc. Although
used chiefly for steel, the metallic-arc method also finds application in
welding many of the non-ferrous alloys.
20.53.2. The submerged-arc process is essentially an automatic form of
metallic-arc welding, which can be used in the straight-line joining of
metals. A bare consumable electrode is used and powdered flux is fed into
the prepared joint so that, on melting, it envelops the melting end of the
electrode and so covers the arc. The weld area is thus coated by protective
slag, allowing a smooth, clean weld surface to be produced. Very high
welding currents can be used making very deep welds possible and the
process is used in shipbuilding, structural engineering and for pressure
vessels as well as in general engineering for mild and alloy steels.
20.53.3. Electro-slag welding is used to join plates generally more than
50 mm thick by a vertical 'run' (Fig. 20.7). A considerable pool of molten
weld metal is maintained between the two work pieces by two copper
'dams' which travel upwards as the weld metal solidifies. One or more bare
steel electrodes are fed into the slag bath which floats on top of the weld
pool. The slag is sufficiently conductive to give rise to resistance heating
and the electrodes melt providing the weld metal.
20.53.4. Gas-shielded arc processes are widely used for all materials

Electric-arc welding processes.
(i) The metallic arc—here molten flux affords protection of the weld region, assisted to a
small extent by a gas shield provided by burning carbonaceous matter in the flux coating,
(ii) The metallic inert gas-arc (MIG) in which a very effective gas blanket is obtained by a
flow of argon or helium around the weld region, (iii) The tungsten inert-gas arc (TIG)—here
a separate filler rod is used, the tungsten electrode being non-consumable.
particularly those in which oxidation is troublesome. In these processes a
bare electrode protrudes from the end of a tube from which also issues an
inert gas (argon, helium or carbon dioxide). The weld region is thus
blanketed by a non-oxidising atmosphere making the use of flux unnecess-
ary (Fig. 20.8(ii)). Carbon dioxide can act as an oxidising atmosphere
when used as a gas shield at high temperatures. Nevertheless this can be
overcome by using filler rods containing deoxidants such as manganese
and silicon. It is a much cheaper gas than argon and during recent years
the CO2 process has become the most popular semi-automatic method for
welding steel.
In the tungsten inert gas—or TIG—process (Fig. 20.8(iii)) the arc is
struck using a non-consumable tungsten electrode and an atmosphere of
argon or helium. Since filler metal is supplied from a separate rod this
makes it a two-handed process requiring high skill when manual welding
is employed. High quality welds are possible with most metals and the
process is widely used in the aircraft and chemical industries, being particu-
larly suitable for heavy-gauge stainless steel.
20.53.5. Plasma-arc welding is related to the TIG process in that argon
passes through an electric arc formed within a very narrow anular orifice
between the tungsten electrode and the water-cooled outer tube. The argon
becomes ionised—or forms 'plasma'—and as these fast-moving ions strike
the weld area to recombine with electrons, considerable heat is generated.
Very deep penetration can be obtained.
Metallic inert gas—or MIG—welding employs a consumable electrode
which is fed continuously from a coil within the hand-held 'gun'. Argon or
helium are used as shielding gases for non-ferrous metals, but for iron and
steel a mixture of argon and CO2 or pure CO2 are used. In the latter case
the process is termed CO2 welding, and the electrode wire will contain
deoxidisers such as silicon, manganese, aluminium or titanium to offset
the oxidising nature of CO2 at high temperatures.

Gas-shielded welding using argon or helium is the only satisfactory
method for welding aluminium alloys. An important feature, common to
all gas-shielded arc methods, is that, since atmospheric nitrogen is kept
away from the weld during fusion, nitrogen embrittlement is avoided.
Gas-shielded arc welding will no doubt displace much of the gas- and
metallic-arc welding now used, due to the superiority of the weld and the
increased speed of manipulation which is possible.
20.53.6. Unshielded arc processes are used for small scale work. Energy
is supplied by spark discharge from a capacitor bank. Thermocouple wires
are commonly joined in this way but the process is used for the mass
production fixing of connecting wires to small components in the elec-
tronics industries. In stud welding by capacitor discharge a small protrusion
is formed on the stud. When this is brought into contact with the work
piece and the circuit thus closed the capacitor bank discharges and resist-
ance heating melts the protrusion so that a weld is obtained.
20.54 Electron-beam Welding In this process, fusion is achieved by
focusing a beam of high-velocity electrons on the weld area. On striking
the metal the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into heat energy
so that melting of the metal occurs. Welding must be carried out in a
vacuum chamber, since the presence of oxygen and nitrogen molecules
would lead to collisions with the electrons and their consequent scatter, as
well as a loss of kinetic energy. Moreover, since the tungsten filament
which emits the electrons is working at 20000C, it would oxidise rapidly if
exposed to the atmosphere.
The process is particularly useful for joining refractory metals, such as
tungsten, molybdenum, niobium and tantalum, and also metals which oxi-
dise easily, such as titanium, beryllium and zirconium.
20.55 Laser Welding has been developed for the production mainly
of spot welds in materials up to 3 mm thick. Unlike electron-beam welding
a vacuum chamber is not required. Inert-gas shielding is provided by focus-
ing the laser beam through the aperture of a nozzle carrying argon (Fig.
20.9). Very high temperatures and hence rapid welding can be achieved.
Since the beam can be focused accurately to a point the process is adaptable
to small-scale work for joining wires, foil and components in the electronics
industries.

Solid-phase Welding
These processes include the oldest of all welding operations, that practised
by the blacksmith at his anvil. The smith heats the two parts to be welded
to a temperature short of actual fusion, and then applies pressure in the
form of hammer blows to cause the surfaces to unite. The sand, which he
often uses as a flux, combines with the iron oxide produced by heating to
a high welding temperature, and forms a fusible slag which is scattered by
the hammer blows.
Electrical-resistance welding is similar in principle, and is used in the
following modifications:
20.60 Spot Welding, in which the parts to be joined overlap and are
firmly gripped between heavy metal electrodes (Fig. 20.10(i)). When the
current is passed, local heating of the sheets to a plastic condition occurs,
resulting in welding at a spot. This method is used mainly for the joining
of sheets and plates and frequently in the production of temporary joints.
It is a very widely used process, particularly when robot-controlled, in the
motor industry.
Fig. 20.10 
The principles of resistance-pressure welding processes: (i) spot; (ii) seam;
(iii) butt. In each case the electrical supply source (E) is the secondary of a 'step-down'
transformer.
20.61 Seam Welding is similar in principle to spot welding but the
electrodes are in the form of wheels which drive the work 'sandwich'
forward (Fig. 20.10(ii)). The current is 'pulsed' to form a series of spot
welds which either overlap or are regularly spaced according to the timing
of motion and current pulsing. The pressure applied to the wheels is suf-
ficient to produce a weld at the heated interface.
20.62 Butt Welding is used to join lengths of rod and wire. The ends
are pressed together (Fig. 20.10(iii)) and an electric current passed through
the work so that the ends are heated to a plastic state due to the higher
electrical resistance existing at the point of contact. The pressure is suf-
ficient to form a weld.
20.63 Flash Welding is similar to butt welding in that ends of sheets
and tubes can be welded together. The process differs, however, in that
the ends are first heated by striking an arc between them. This not only
damp
electrodes

produces the necessary high temperature but also melts away any irregu-
larities at the ends, which are then brought into sudden contact under
pressure so that a sound weld is produced.
20.64 Projection Welding is similar in some respects to stud welding
except that here electrical resistance heating and pressure are supplied by
the electrodes. A projection is punched into one of the work pieces so
that point contact occurs when the work pieces are clamped between the
electrodes. Localised heating occurs so that, under pressure, the projection
collapses and a weld is formed.
20.65 Ultrasonic Welding is a cold-joining process in which a bond
is produced between the work pieces by ultrasonic vibratory energy. The
work is gripped between an anvil and a 'sonotrode' tip which vibrates
laterally at an ultrasonic frequency. Surface films of oxide are ruptured
and welding then occurs between the slipping surfaces under the gripping
pressure. This method is used for joining wires, foils and in printed circuits
in the electronics industry.
20.66 Cold Welding is used for lap joints in sheet and butt joints in
wire and rod. Sheets are placed together and then punched so that slip
occurs between their surfaces. This breaks up surface films of oxide so that
intimate contact is achieved between the metal surfaces, leading to weld-
ing. Only malleable metals like copper and aluminium can be welded in
this way.
20.67 Friction Welding is used to butt-weld rods and bars. One bar
is held in a rotating chuck whilst the other is held in a stationary but
pressure-loaded chuck (Fig. 20.11). As the ends of the work pieces are
brought together considerable friction between the interfaces causes
softening and consequent welding. An advantage of this process is that
dissimilar metals can be joined. Thus carbon steel can be welded success-
fully to high-speed steel, titanium, aluminium and zirconium. It has been
used successfully in the motor car industry for joining transmission
members, back axles and steering gear.
The underwater repair of cracked butt welds in off-shore structures by
friction stitch welding is now employed. Essentially this involves rotating a
tapered 'filler plug' in a prepared tapered cavity until welding occurs.
Overlapping welds are made by /stitching' along the length of the defect.
20.68 Explosive Welding is useful in welding together sheets of dis-
similar metals, eg cladding of steel. The sheets are placed at a slight angle
to each other and a high-explosive charge detonated above the upper sheet.
The surfaces virtually 'jet' together and welding occurs.

20.69 Diffusion Bonding is also employed to join sheet material. The
sheets are held face-to-face under light pressure in a vacuum chamber. The
temperature is then raised sufficiently for diffusion to occur across the
interface so that the surfaces become joined by a region of solid solution.
To ensure that bonding occurs in less than two hours temperatures are
usually in the range 0.5-0.8 Tm (where Tm is the melting point of the
metal on the absolute scale). Applied pressures are sufficiently low so that
deformation is less than 5%—above this the joining process is deemed to
be pressure welding. Steel can be clad with brass in this way whilst titanium
alloys such as Ti-6A1-4V can be diffusion bonded at 925°C.
The Microstructure of Welds
20.70 Since high temperatures are necessary during welding, a weld will
exhibit a coarse crystal structure in contrast to the parent metal around it
which is generally in the wrought condition. Some elements such as chro-
mium (in steel), accelerate grain growth, so that in these cases an enlarged
grain may also be expected in that metal near to the weld.
A weld produced by one of the fusion methods will show an as-cast type
of structure. Not only will the crystals be large but other as-cast features,
such as coring, segregation and the like, may also be present, giving rise
to intercrystalline weakness. The overall effect on grain size which will
prevail in most metals and alloys is indicated in Fig. 20.12(i). Here the
heat-affected zone will encompass those parts of the work pieces which
have been heated in excess of the recrystallisation temperature long enough
for recrystallisation to take place. In the arc welding of steel this heat-
affected zone extends for only a few millimetres, but in oxyacetylene and
electro-slag welding it may be considerably wider. When possible it is of
advantage to work a weld mechanically by hammering it while hot. This
produces a fine grain as recrystallisation takes place; it also minimises the
effects of coring and segregation.
20.71 Changes other than simple recrystallisation may occur in the
Fig. 20.12

heat-affected zone near to a weld made in carbon steels containing more
than 0.35% carbon (Fig. 20.12(ii)) and three separate sections may be
present in the heat-affected zone:
(a) That part of the zone in which the temperature exceeds the upper-
critical (A3) will undergo complete transformation to austenite and the
temperature gradient within the zone will result in variation in this aus-
tenite grain size. On cooling the austenite grain size will be reflected in
that of the ferrite/pearlite structure produced so that very near to the
weld a Widmanstatten structure may be present.
(b) The region in which the temperature reached was between the
upper critical (/I3) and the lower critical (A\ or 723°C) will transform only
partially. Pearlite will transform to austenite containing 0.8% carbon and
then begin to absorb primary ferrite as the temperature exceeds 723°C.
However, subsequent cooling may be rapid enough for this austenite
(being of near-eutectoid composition) to form martensite so that a brittle
region is produced in that part of the heat-affected zone.
(c) In that section of the heat-affected zone where the temperature
exceeds that of recrystallisation (about 5000C) the original cold-worked
structure of the plate will tend to recrystallise without undergoing any
phase-change.
The brittle martensite region may be more extensive in alloy steels of
the oil- or air-hardening types since their lower transformation rates will
be more likely to favour martensite formation.
The Inspection and Testing of Welds
20.80 Each fusion weld is produced individually and its quality will reflect
the degree of skill of the welder. Even where some automation is possible
in the welding process a number of variables will control the quality of the
weld in so far as internal soundness, adequate fusion and extent of oxida-
tion are concerned. Consequently for high-grade work inspection, coupled
with non-destructive testing are necessary.
20.81 Visual Examination The type of defect encountered may vary
widely with the material being welded and the type of process used, but
intelligent and careful examination of the resulting weld will often indicate
whether it is likely to be satisfactory. Rough, burnt and blistered surfaces
suggest overheating and gassing during welding, whilst spattering in arc
welding indicates incorrect arc conditions. Insufficient fusion and fluxing
are also defects which are relatively easy to detect.
In fusion welding the weld should be somewhat built-up above the parts
being joined, to allow for subsequent trimming by grinding. Defects such
as undercutting due to insufficient fusion, insufficient penetration and
insufficient weld metal are shown in Fig. 20.13.
20.82 Non-destructive Tests Cracks in or near welds can be detected
by means of a magnetic crack detector (2.82), assuming of course that both
weld metal and work pieces are of a ferromagnetic material (carbon steels

Fig. 20.13 
Some welding defects revealed by simple visual inspection: (i) satisfactory weld;
(ii) insufficient weld metal; (iii) incomplete penetration; (iv) undercutting and concavity of

and ferritic alloy steels). An advantage of this method is that it will detect
fissures just below the surface. Surface cracks in both ferrous and non-
ferrous materials can be detected by dye penetrant (2.81) ox fluorescent dye
penetrant methods.
Internal defects such as slag inclusions, gas porosity or other cavities can
be detected by using a radiation method (X-rays or y-rays) or by an ultra-
sonic method. The penetrating power of radiation increases with its energy
so that whilst normal X-ray machines (2.91) can be used for steel up to
about 80 mm thick, greater thicknesses require the use of either special
high-voltage X-ray tubes of the order of 1 MV or, alternatively, y-rays
derived from a suitable radioactive isotope (2.93). A particular advantage
of the latter method is its portability as in site fabrication or where access
is difficult.
Increasing use is made of ultrasonic testing (2.96) for detecting faults in
both butt and fillet welds (radiation methods being inadequate for the
latter). Ultrasonic methods can be adapted to the high speed mechanised
testing of long straight welds as in seam-welded tubes. Here the height of
the echo trace (which is a measure of the extent of the defect) is monitored
on the cathode ray tube. When the height of the trace exceeds a pre-
determined maximum the monitor causes the defective region of the weld
to be marked with paint.
20.83 Testing Specimen Welds Welded joints can be produced in
the form of test pieces and tested to destruction. The result will provide
useful information regarding the general quality of the process and indicate
whether similar results may be expected during subsequent production.
Bend tests are often applied, whilst tensile tests and impact tests also
provide useful information. Failure may occur in the weld, in the metal
adjoining the weld or between the two. In the latter case, particularly when
failure occurs at low stresses, inadequate fusion may be suspected and will
often be clearly indicated by the appearance of the fracture, which, instead
of being crystalline, is that of the smooth prepared surface. When failure
occurs in the weld, visual examination will sometimes reveal such defects
as porosity, slag globules and fissures.
Macro-examination of a suitably etched specimen will provide infor-
mation on the soundness of a weld and also reveal the boundary between
weld metal and base metal. A specimen should be cut from the welded
joint so that it displays a complete transverse section of the weld. It can
then be prepared as indicated in 10.40 and etched in one of the reagents
mentioned in Table 10.6. The hydrochloric acid etch will reveal un-
soundness by enlarging gas pockets and also by dissolving slag inclusions.

Microscopical examination of polished and etched sections will, in
addition to revealing such defects as porosity, slag, cracks and oxide
inclusions, also indicate such purely metallurgical defects as overheating,
decarburisation and other microstructural defects associated with compo-
sition, temperature effects and rates of cooling. Special effects, such as
carbide precipitation in stainless steels, can only be detected in this way.
The Weldability of Metals and Alloys
20.90 The ease with which an alloy can be welded depends upon a
number of factors such as the tendency towards oxidation and volatilisation
of one or more of its constituents, its ability to dissolve or react with other
gases present and the coefficient of expansion which will influence crack
formation in or near the weld during solidification. High thermal conduc-
tivity of the work pieces will demand a greater energy input during welding.
Fusion welding differs from brazing and soldering in that the filler metal
is of a similar composition or at least contains a high proportion of the
same elements as the work pieces themselves. Hence the problem of the
filler metal being able to alloy with the work pieces does not arise. By
developing suitable techniques most metals and alloys can be welded suc-
cessfully by one or other of the standard processes whilst for the more
refractory metals specialised methods such as electron or laser beam can
be used.
20.91 Mild steel and structural steels containing up to 0.3% carbon
have been by far the most widely used materials in welded fabrications in
all industries. Mild steel welds with ease using gas, arc or resistance
methods. Electrodes are usually coated with a flux containing lime and
silica along with ferromanganese or ferrosilicon to act as a deoxidant in
the weld pool. Calcium fluoride may be included to increase flux fluidity.
As indicated in 20.71 some brittleness may occur in the heat-affected
zone when steels containing 0.3% carbon are welded. Fortunately the
improvement in quality of low-carbon structural steels in recent years has
enabled carbon contents to be reduced to 0.1% or less, the required mech-
anical properties being attained by 'micro-alloying' (13.140). Thus weld-
ability has been improved considerably as required by changes in
construction methods where welding has replaced riveting as the main
joining method over the last half century. 'Micro-alloy' steels suitable for
welding contain 0.3% silicon and in excess of 1.0% manganese, in addition
to 0.1% (or less) carbon and small amounts of niobium, vanadium or
titanium; silicon to improve fluidity and manganese to assist in deoxidation
in the weld pool.
20.92 High-carbon steels are more difficult to weld because of reac-
tions between carbon and any oxygen that enters the weld pool:

Porosity in the weld is likely due to the gas, carbon monoxide, CO,
evolved. This effect is minimised by using deoxidants such as ferromangan-
ese or ferrosilicon in the flux coating when metallic-arc welding is em-
ployed.
In the CO2 process the gas atmosphere can have a mildly oxidising effect
as some dissociation occurs at the arc temperature:
2CO2 ^ 2CO + O2
Hence the bare electrodes used must contain sufficient manganese or sili-
con to act as deoxidants in the weld pool.
Brittleness arising from the formation of martensite during cooling
(20.71) may be prevented by pre-heating (or post-heating) the work in
order to induce a slower cooling rate. Carbon pick-up by the weld metal
from the parent metal also causes brittleness, particularly since a coarse
as-cast Widmanstatten structure can be expected to form, and this may
lead to the formation of cracks in or near the weld during cooling. This is
often overcome by a technique known as buttering. A layer of weld metal
is deposited on each half of the work piece before they are joined. Some
carbon is absorbed by this layer but, since the parts are not joined, cracking
will be unlikely to occur. The two buttered sections can then be welded
with safety since little carbon is likely to reach the actual weld.
Where applicable, the hammering of welds whilst still hot brings about
an improvement in properties due to the refinement in crystal structure
which it produces. Normalising will also help to reduce the size of the
as-cast type of crystals present in ferrous welds made by fusion processes.
20.93 Alloy Steels can generally be successfully welded, provided the
correct type of filler rod is used. Low-alloy steels are often welded with
plain steel welding rods containing 0.2% carbon, 1.4% manganese and
0.4% silicon, since there is generally sufficient pick-up of other alloying
elements from the metals being welded.
Since low-alloy steels are basically of the oil- or air-hardening types it
follows that martensite is very likely to form in the heat-affected zone
during subsequent cooling giving rise to 'cold-cracking'. Where possible
the whole weldment is preheated to between the Ms and Mi temperatures
and held there for up to thirty minutes after welding is complete so that
isothermal transformation of austenite to bainite will occur and frustrate
the formation of martensite which would otherwise take place during air-
cooling.
The filler rods used to weld stainless steels are usually of composition
similar to the stainless steel being welded, thus limiting the possibility of
electrolytic action at the weld during service. The problems associated with
welding stainless steels depend upon whether the steels are of the ferritic
or austenitic types (13.44). Ferritic high-chromium steels will suffer from
grain growth in the heat-affected zone (Fig. 20.14 (i)) and also the forma-
tion of martensite if the steel contains sufficient carbon and is permitted
to cool at a rate which will give rise to air-hardening. Alternatively, with
slow cooling rates, the carbide Cr?C3 may be precipitated. Schaeffler dia-

grams (13.18) were originally devised with the object of predicting the
structural changes likely to occur in stainless steels during welding.
Austenitic 18/8 stainless steels are likely to suffer from a defect com-
monly termed 'weld decay' if the carbon content exceeds 0.03%. Such a
steel is normally cooled quickly from 10500C after hot rolling is finished,
in order to keep carbon in solution in the austenitic structure. If the steel
is subsequently heated in the temperature range 450-8500C particles of
the carbide Cr23 C6 will precipitate at the grain boundaries of the austenite
(Pl. 13.1c) and this will cause the region adjacent to the boundaries to be
severely depleted in chromium. This region then becomes anodic (21.30)
to the remainder of the crystal and so goes into solution in the presence
of a strong electrolyte. During a fusion welding process some parts of the
work pieces near the weld will inevitably be at temperatures between 4500C
and 8500C for long enough to permit precipitation of carbides of chromium
to take place and it is here that corrosion will occur (Fig. 20.14(ii)) particu-
larly if the weld is in a stainless steel tank carrying corrosive liquids. The
carbides of chromium particles can be re-dissolved by heating the complete
weldment to 10500C and quenching but this is not often possible for obvious
reasons.
The most effective method of increasing the resistance of the steel to
weld decay is to include about 1% of titanium or niobium. These metals
have very high affinities for carbon and so effectively 'tie up' most of the
carbon as titanium or niobium carbides. These do not dissolve, except in
very small quantities, during the normal hot-working or annealing pro-
cesses, so that the carbon content of the austenite is extremely low and
carbides of chromium cannot therefore precipitate in significant amounts.
Consequently most of the chromium remains distributed evenly within the
austenite. Nevertheless small quantities of carbon can still precipitate as
carbides of chromium and exposure to strong mineral acids or chloride

solutions would lead to some corrosion. In such cases the carbon content
of the steel is best kept below 0.03% in addition to the inclusion of 1%
titanium or niobium.
20.94 Cast Iron either of the grey or SG iron varieties are the ones
most commonly welded. Each can be welded successfully when a suitable
filler rod is used. For repair work by gas welding a cast-iron filler rod may
be used but for arc welding a filler metal containing 55Ni-45Fe is necessary.
Brittleness is likely to occur in the heat-affected zone. As the work pieces
become austenitic on heating graphite flakes (or spheroids in S.G. iron)
are dissolved and as the zone cools relatively rapidly this carbon is precipi-
tated as an intercrystalline network of primary cementite instead of graph-
ite giving a white-iron type of structure. At lower temperatures still, the
remaining austenite, which contains 0.8% carbon, is likely to form some
martensite thus adding to the brittleness introduced by the cementite net-
work. This brittleness in the heat-affected zone may be reduced by preheat-
ing the work to 3000C before welding or by annealing the weldment at
6500C after welding. Alternatively, bronze welding may be used, though
this introduces the danger of electrolytic action between the weld metal
and the surrounding cast iron and may lead to the accelerated corrosion
of the latter which will be anodic to the bronze weld (21.36).
Malleable cast iron of the whiteheart variety can be welded easily in the
manner of mild steel. The temper carbon present in blackheart malleable
castings, however, presents a problem similar to that arising from graphite
in ordinary cast iron. This temper carbon dissolves in the austenite on
heating and, on cooling, precipitates as cementite networks whilst some
martensite may also form as in the case of grey iron. The best results are
obtained by low-temperature bronze welding.
20.95 Copper and its Alloys The high thermal conductivity of pure
copper makes resistance welding of it by either spot or seam processes
impracticable but, since most copper alloys have lower thermal conduc-
tivities, they can be joined successfully by these methods. The inadvisabil-
ity of welding tough-pitch copper by gas methods has been mentioned
(16.22) and, instead, phosphorus-deoxidised copper along with filler rods
rich in deoxidants such as silicon and manganese or aluminium and
titanium are used since phosphorus is inadequate as a deoxidant for the
weld pool under these conditions. Tough-pitch copper may be welded by
one of the inert gas shielded arc methods using similar filler rods to those
just mentioned.
Those copper alloys which contain elements having a high affinity for
oxygen, viz. aluminium, silicon, tin and zinc, are not subject to gas porosity
and need no deoxidant additions to the filler metal. Brasses are difficult to
weld because of volatilisation of zinc at the welding temperature. This may
cause some porosity of the weld. For arc welding low-grade brasses and
phosphor bronzes a filler rod of silicon bronze (96Cu; 4Si) is often used
since silicon not only acts as a deoxidant but also increases fluidity of the
weld metal.
Filler rods used for welding brasses sometimes contain small amounts of
aluminium as a deoxidant. Welds in brass are improved by mechanical

work which refines the grain. In the a + (3 phase brasses this work must
be carried out whilst the weld is still hot, but in the ductile a-phase brasses
it is best carried out in the cold and followed by a stress-relief annealing
process which will lead to the formation of fine grain.
In the flame-welding of copper-nickel alloys care must be taken that
sulphur is absent from the atmosphere, as this will cause a very serious
deterioration in the properties of the metal around the weld. Nickel readily
forms sulphides, for which reasons a sulphurous atmosphere always attacks
alloys containing nickel.
20.96 Aluminium and its Alloys have a high affinity for oxygen and
the tenacious oxide skin formed on the surface of molten aluminium acts
as a barrier in fusion welding. In oxyacetylene processes therefore a flux
containing the fluorides and chlorides of lithium, sodium and potassium is
used whilst for metallic arc welding potassium sulphate and cryolite are
added to this mixture. These fluxes effectively dissolve aluminium oxide
but, since they are potentially corrosive, must be washed off the completed
weld. Consequently the bulk of fusion welding of aluminium alloys is now
carried out by MIG or TIG processes.
Obviously attempts to fusion weld either work-hardened or precipi-
tation-hardened aluminium alloys would lead to softening and loss of
strength in the heat-affected zone. For this reason such alloys, which are
widely used in aircraft construction, are generally joined by riveting. Some
resistance welding of such alloys is carried out but this entails special
surface cleaning and also the use of high welding currents because of the
high thermal conductivity of aluminium.
The most common and troublesome defect in fusion welds in aluminium
is porosity due to the presence of hydrogen. The gas is highly soluble in
molten aluminium but only slightly soluble in solid aluminium—hence any
dissolved during the welding process is rejected as minute bubbles during
solidification of the weld. The main source of hydrogen is moisture, either
in the electrode coating or in surface oxide. Thus porosity is at a minimum
when welding clean work pieces by the TIG process.
20.97 Magnesium Alloys like those of aluminium, have a high affin-
ity for oxygen and the refractory oxide formed is only slightly less trouble-
some. In oxy-gas welding, fluxes containing the chlorides of sodium, po-
tassium and calcium, along with sodium fluoride are used. These fluxes are
very corrosive to the work pieces so that the TIG process is used for nearly
all magnesium-alloy welding.
20.98 Nickel Alloys may be welded by the majority of the common
processes and the most frequent metallurgical problem is high-temperature
embrittlement by sulphur, for which nickel has a high affinity forming
weak intercrystalline films of nickel sulphide. Sulphur may be derived from
drawing or machining oils, grease, paint or temperature-indicating crayons
contaminating the surface of the work. Cleaning with a solvent such as
trichloroethene is therefore advisable.
Porosity may arise from oxygen or nitrogen dissolved in the weld pool,
so filler rods containing aluminium, titanium or niobium are used since
both gases will combine with these metals.

20.99 Refractory and Reactive Metals Beryllium, titanium, niobium,
zirconium, tantalum and tungsten have specialised uses in nuclear and
space technology. Since many of them are very reactive at the welding
temperature special methods are necessary in welding them. The electron-
beam method is particularly suitable since it operates in a vacuum and will
also provide the necessary high temperature quickly. Spot, seam, pressure,
ultrasonic and explosive welding are also employed but the TIG process,
operated without a filler rod, is probably the most widely used method.
Most of these metals are welded autogenously, that is, no filler metal is
supplied, the weld metal being derived from the edges of the work pieces.

Metallic Corrosion and
its Prevention
21.10 Of all metallurgical problems which confront the engineer, few can
be economically more important than the prevention of metallic corrosion.
In Great Britain alone it is estimated that the cost of metallic corrosion is
of the order of 3% of the annual gross national product which is equivalent
to £10 billion or £150 per capita. This is perhaps less surprising when one
considers, as an example, the team of painters permanently employed in
protecting the steel of the Forth Railway Bridge from the ravages of air,
rain and sea water. Nevertheless even more significant is the amount of
steel which is allowed to rust away for lack of adequate protection. This
amounts to some 1000 tonnes every single day—surely an expensive way
of 'saving jobs'. But enough of this cynicism.
Other metals, in addition to iron and steel, corrode when exposed to
the atmosphere. The green corrosion-product which covers a copper roof,
or the white, powdery film formed on some unprotected aluminium alloys
is clear evidence of this.
Metals do not corrode where there is no atmosphere. The expensive
Hasselblad camera left behind on the Moon by the American astronauts
will remain in perfect condition as far as its metal parts are concerned,
though radiation may damage some of its non-metallic components. More-
over little corrosion of most engineering alloys, including carbon steels,
occurs in a dry atmosphere at ambient temperatures; but when the atmos-
phere is also moisture laden it is a very different matter and 'rusting' of
steel is rapid. Fossil fuels, and in particular coal, contain varying quantities
of sulphur and nitrogen compounds. On combustion these compounds
yield sulphur dioxide and some oxides of nitrogen which, if not extracted
from the flue gases, will escape to the atmosphere where they will combine
with moisture to form the corrosive agents sulphurous, nitrous and nitric
acids. Over much of Europe, both West and East, this accelerates the
corrosion of metals, destroys ancient and modern buildings and kills large
tracts of our forests. To extract the acidic oxides from flue gases is an
21

expensive process which, in turn, will create some of its own environmental
problems but it must be done. The only alternative seems to be the use of
nuclear-derived power in our current state of technology.
The Mechanism of Corrosion
21.20 Oxidation or 'Dry' Corrosion The metals of Group I and II of
the Periodic Classification react readily with oxygen so that, apart from
beryllium and magnesium which are useful because of their very low spe-
cific gravities combined with good strength, they are of little use as
materials in constructional engineering. Most of the engineering metals are
to be found in the 'transition' groups where affinity for atmospheric oxygen
is rather less. Oxidation of many of these metals is extremely slow at
ambient temperatures but occurs much more rapidly as the temperature
rises as is demonstrated by the scaling of steel at red heat. When iron is
heated in an atmosphere containing available oxygen it becomes coated
with a layer of black oxide scale, FeO:
2Fe 4- O2 -> 2FeO
The above equation is only a simplified way of expressing the reaction. In
fact atoms of iron have been oxidised whilst atoms of oxygen have been
reduced. These processes are related to a transfer of electrons from atoms
of iron to atoms of oxygen:
Fe —> Fe+4" + 2 electrons (e~) (Oxidation)
O + 2 electrons (e") -> O~~ 
(Reduction)
The terms 'oxidation' and 'reduction' have a wider meaning in chemistry
and involve reactions in which oxygen takes no part. Thus, sulphur gases
will attack nickel alloys at high temperatures giving rise to intercrystalline
corrosion by the formation of nickel sulphide films. In this instance nickel
has been 'oxidised' even though the element oxygen is not involved:
Ni -> Ni++ + 2e" (Oxidation)
S + 2e~ -> S~~ (Reduction)
Consequently, in its wider sense, oxidation can be described as a process
where the atom involved loses electrons; whilst reduction can be described
as a process where the atom gains electrons.
21.21 Affinity for oxygen is not the sole criterion affecting the rate at
which a metal oxidises. Although aluminium has a very high affinity for
oxygen it is nevertheless corrosion resistant. This is due largely to the
dense and impervious nature of the oxide film which forms on the surface
and so protects it from further attack. The extent to which an oxide film
will protect the metal beneath depends upon two factors:

(i) the continuity of the film and how effectively it bonds to the metallic
surface. Some films are porous and offer poor protection whilst others
crack or peel away with repeated heating and cooling of the metal. Such
metals and alloys oxidise progressively.
(ii) the mobility of metal and non-metal ions within the oxide film.
Iron at a high temperature will continue to oxidise even though coated
with an oxide skin. Iron atoms at the metal interface ionise (Fig. 21.1),
releasing electrons which travel quickly to the surface of the scale. There
the electrons react with oxygen from the air forming ions, O 
. These
oxide ions are then attracted towards the oppositely-charged Fe++ ions.
Although the equilibrium composition of the oxide skin is Fe++O~~ that
near the metal surface will contain an excess of Fe++ ions and that
adjacent to the atmosphere will contain more O 
ions. The rate at
which new ions form depends upon their mobilities within the oxide
film. That is, new Fe++ ions will form as existing ones diffuse away from
the metal surface towards O 
ions. The more rapidly Fe++ ions move
away, the more rapidly will iron atoms ionise to produce new Fe++ ions.
Prolonged heating of large steel ingots for hot rolling produces a very
thick layer of scale. The concentration gradients of Fe++ and O 
ions
within this layer are often so great that three separate crystalline zones
are found in the layer. The thin zone adjacent to the metal surface is of
basic composition, FeO, whilst that in contact with the atmosphere is of
composition Fe2O3. Between the two is a zone containing the intermedi-
ate oxide Fe3O4—or FeO-Fe2O3.
21.22 When two steel surfaces are in contact under fairly high pressure
and at the same time subjected to alternating or vibrational stresses, fretting
corrosion may occur. Differences in elastic properties between the surfaces
may lead to localised welding of contacting high spots. The welds sub-
sequently rupture and local high temperatures, set up as a result of friction,
cause oxidation of the surface. Fretting is indicated by the presence of a
reddish-brown powdery deposit of oxide, Fe2O3, sometimes referred to as
cocoa powder. This is highly abrasive and so accelerates the attack. Fret-
ting is prevalent in wire ropes and occurs in splines and other press-fitted
components which are subjected to alternating stresses. In addition to
general wear, such corrosion can lead to the initiation of fatigue cracks

particularly since the affected components are subjected to vibrational
stresses. Though difficult to eliminate completely it can be minimised by
excluding air by the use of a high-pressure grease or by the use of a solid
high-pressure lubricant such as molybdenum disulphide.
21.23 As indicated above oxidation in industrial atmospheres is rarely
a simple process involving oxygen only. Contaminants such as carbon diox-
ide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and water vap-
our are frequently responsible for the very rapid deterioration of metals
at high temperatures. Under varying conditions carbon dioxide can pro-
mote both oxidation and carburisation in alloys. This phenomenon leads
to green rot in Nimonic Alloys—precipitation of &23C6 leaves the matrix
so depleted in protective chromium that extensive oxidation of the nickel
to green NiO occurs rapidly.
Nimonic and other nickel-base superalloys are rapidly attacked in the
presence of sulphur-rich combustion gases. This leads to the formation of
black NiS so that the effect is aptly described as black plague. Solid ash
from burning fuel, carried in the combustion gas stream, can also react
chemically with surface oxidation products. As a result a fluxing action
may take place resulting in the formation of fluid products at temperatures
above 6500C. Fluid glassy slags so formed dissolve oxides rapidly so that a
metallic surface is exposed to further oxidation. The very rapid corrosion
of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys which occurs under such conditions is known as
catastrophic oxidation.
21.30 Electrolytic Action or Wet Corrosion Involving Two Dissimi-
lar Elements Electrolytic action in one form or another is responsible
for the bulk of corrosion which occurs in metals at ambient temperatures.
In this particular instance it will occur when two dissimilar metals of differ-
ent 'electrode potential' are in electrical contact with each other and with
an 'electrolyte'. The term 'electrolyte' describes some substance which
contains both positively- and negatively-charged ions, able to move about
freely within it.
Much of this chemical action is similar to that which occurs in a simple
Galvanic cell (Fig. 21.2), consisting of a copper plate and a zinc plate,
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (the electrolyte). When the external
circuit is closed a current begins to flow through the ammeter. This current
is composed of electrons which are released in the zinc plate and, as their
concentration builds up there, are forced to flow to the copper plate. As
a result of the loss of electrons zinc atoms become zinc ions (Zn++) and
pass into solution in the electrolyte:
Zn -> Zn++ + 2e"
As the electrons, which have been forced round the external circuit by
pressure of numbers, collect on the copper plate it becomes negatively
charged so that hydrogen ions (H+), present in the electrolyte from ionised
sulphuric acid, are attracted to the copper plate where they combine with
the available electrons to form ordinary atoms and, hence, molecules of
hydrogen so that bubbles of the gas form on the copper plate:

Fig. 21.2 The chemical reactions in the simple cell.
The conventional direction ascribed to the current in the early days of electrical technology
is opposite to that in which electrons in fact flow.
2H+ + 2e~ —> H2 (bubbles on copper plate)
ZN++ ions 'pair up' with SO4 
ions in the electrolyte so that as the
concentration of sulphuric acid falls that of zinc sulphate rises. Thus we
obtain 'electrical energy' at the expense of a loss of chemical 'potential
energy' by the zinc.
This electrolytic action occurs as the result of a difference in 'electrode
potential' between copper and zinc (Table 21.1). The electrode potential
of a metal is related to the amount of energy required to remove the
valence electrons from its atoms. Thus zinc loses its valence electrons more
readily than does copper and zinc is said to be anodic towards copper. The
electrode which supplies electrons to the external circuit is called the anode
whilst the electrode which receives electrons via the external circuit is
called the cathode.
21.31 The reader may have been puzzled by the fact that Fig. 21.2
shows electrons as flowing in the opposite direction to that indicated for
current in most elementary text books of electrical technology. The Greek
derivation of the term anode suggests something which is being built up
and in fact the anode was so named in 1800 because it was thought at that
time that positively-charged 'particles of electricity' were passing through

the external circuit from the cathode to the anode. We now know that the
electric current in the external circuit is in fact a flow of negatively-charged
particles (electrons) in the opposite direction. The original convention of
current direction is, however, still retained.
21.32 The bulk of metallic corrosion is due to electrolytic action of this
type. Electrolytic action is possible when two different metals or alloys are
in electrical contact with each other and are also in common contact with
an electrolyte. Action such as this occurs when a damaged 'tin can' is left
out in the rain. If some of the tin coating has been scratched away so that
the mild steel beneath is exposed, electrolytic action takes place between
the tin and the mild steel when the surface becomes wet with rain water
or condensation (Fig. 21.3A). Water containing oxygen or other dissolved
gases is ionised to the extent that it will act as an electrolyte, and electrons
flow from the iron (mild steel) to the tin, leading to the release of Fe++
ions into solution. Thus, once the coating is broken, the presence of tin
accelerates the rusting of iron it was meant to protect, and the electrolytic
action follows the same general pattern as that which prevails in the simple
cell. The iron of the can corresponds to the zinc plate, the tin coating to
the copper plate and the solution of oxygen in water to the dilute sulphuric
acid used as the electrolyte in the simple cell. Industrial atmospheres accel-
erate corrosion because of the sulphur dioxide they contain. This gas is
present due to the combustion of sulphur in coal and other fuels. Sulphur
dioxide dissolves in atmospheric moisture forming sulphurous acid which
has a much stronger electrolytic action than has dissolved oxygen. How-
ever, in the pages which follow electrolytic corrosion related only to the
anion, -OH", is discussed; but it should be appreciated that in industrial
atmospheres containing the anions -SO3 
, —NO2~ and -NO3", electro-
lytic corrosion will be accelerated by the presence of these strongly electro-
negative ions.
21.33 Metallic coatings are frequently used to protect steel from cor-
rosion, but it is necessary to consider in each case how corrosion will be

The mechanisms of electrolytic corrosion.
affected if the coating becomes scratched or broken. Thus metals used to
protect steel can be divided into two groups:
(a) Metals which are cathodic towards iron, such as copper, nickel or
tin. These metals can be used only if a good-quality coating is assured,
since protection offered is purely mechanical in that the coating isolates
the surface of the steel from the corrosive medium. Suppose that at some
point in a tin-coated iron sheet the tin film is broken (Fig 21.3A). Here
the tin film acts as a cathode and the steel the anode. Fe++ ions go into
solution and electrons, so released, travel to the tin cathode where they
react with water and dissolved oxygen:

Thus hydroxide ions (OH ) are released at the cathode and, away from
the region of the cell, these combine with Fe++ ions:
Fe++ + 2OH- -> Fe(OH)2
Iron(II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)2, so formed quickly oxidises to iron(III)
hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, the basis of the reddish-brown substance we call
rust. Thus corrosion of the steel is actually accelerated when a coating
of some substance which is cathodic to steel becomes damaged. Fortu-
nately, in the case of both tin and nickel, metals commonly used to coat
iron and steel, the difference in electrode potential in the cell so formed
is small, so that the acceleration of attack is not great. The further apart
metals are in the electro-chemical series (Table 21.1) the greater the rate
of corrosion of the anode.
(b) Metals which are anodic towards iron, such as zinc and aluminium.
These metals will go into solution in preference to steel (Fig 21.3B) to
which they will therefore offer some chemical, as well as mechanical,
protection. Since they protect the steel by going into solution themselves,
such protection is generally referred to as 'sacrificial'. Zinc is used in
this way for galvanising steel products, whilst aluminium is effective as
a protective paint partly for the same reason. It must be emphasised
however that the object of galvanising should be to produce a sound
continuous coating of zinc on the surface because sacrificial protection
will only be temporary should the coating be porous.
21.34 Having dealt briefly with the principles of electrolytic corrosion,
we are now in a position to give an adequate explanation of the rusting of
mild steel (Fig 21.4). Here electrolytic action takes place between the iron
and the oxide film which will be present on the surface—assuming of
course that the oxide film is broken and that the gap is covered by an
electrolyte (moisture containing dissolved oxygen).

Since iron is anodic to its oxide, it will go into solution as ions:
Fe -> Fe++ + 2e"
The electrons which are released travel to the cathode and take part in the
reaction:
H2O + '/2O2 + 2e" -> 2OH-
(from
atmosphere)
As a result, Fe++ ions go into solution at the anode and hydroxide ions
(OH~) form at the cathode. When these two different sorts of ions meet
away from the region of electrolytic action the following reaction occurs:
Fe++ + 2OH- -> Fe(OH)2
This iron(II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)2, is quickly oxidised by atmospheric oxy-
gen to iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, which is precipitated as a reddish-
brown substance, the main constituent of rust.
21.35 So far we have been dealing only with electrolytic action between
some surface coating and the metal supporting it. The same type of cor-
rosion may take place at the surface of a metal in which particles of an
impurity are present as part of the microstructure. In Fig 21.3c it is assumed
that the particle of impurity is cathodic towards the metallic matrix, thus
causing the latter to dissolve. Since impurities are often segregated at
crystal boundaries, this will lead to gradual intercrystalline corrosion of
the material as more particles of impurity become exposed by electrolytic
action.
21.36 Those metallic alloys which have a crystal structure consisting of
two different phases existing side by side are also prone to electrolytic
corrosion. If one phase is anodic with respect to the other it will tend to
dissolve when the surface is wetted by a suitable electrolyte. Patches of
pearlite in steel will tend to corrode in this manner (Fig 21.5). Ferrite is

anodic to cementite, consequently ferrite goes into solution (as Fe++ ions)
and the electrolytic action is similar to that which takes place between
ferrite and an oxide film during the rusting of mild steel mentioned above.
This leaves the brittle cementite platelets standing in relief, but these will
ultimately break off as corrosion proceeds and increases their fragility. It
is therefore apparent that in order to have a high corrosion-resistance, a
metal or alloy should have a structure consisting of one type of phase only,
so that no electrolytic action can take place. Similarly, as engineers will
know, it is unwise to rivet or weld together two alloys of widely different
electrode potentials if they are likely to come into contact with a substance
which can act as an electrolyte. In such circumstances the alloy with the
lower electrode potential may corrode heavily due to electrolytic action.
An example of bad practice of this type is illustrated in Fig. 21.6. Here a
steel pipe has been connected to a copper pipe. If the system carries water
which is not chemically pure, then electrolytic corrosion of the steel, which
is anodic to copper, can be expected. This corrosion will be much more
rapid than if the whole pipe were of steel.
Those readers who are householders will probably be aware that the
galvanised cold-water tank corrodes more quickly in that region adjacent
to the copper inlet-valve mechanism, zinc being strongly anodic to copper.
This form of plumbing is doubtless very good for trade, particularly as
failure of the tank usually occurs when the room beneath has been newly
decorated. The obvious remedy is to match the copper plumbing with a
copper tank—which is less expensive than it sounds. Fortunately most
modern domestic plumbing systems now used 'plastics' (polypropylene)
cold-water tanks which are of course impervious to electrolytic corrosion
and are also relatively inexpensive.
21.37 The extent to which electrolytic action between two dissimilar
electrodes takes place depends not only upon the difference in potential
between them but also upon the chemical nature of the electrolyte, and in
particular the concentration of hydrogen ions (pH). For example, our
motor cars rot away even more rapidly as a result of the salt used on roads
during winter. When electrovalent compounds dissolve in water molecules

of the latter tend also to ionise thus increasing the hydrogen ion concen-
tration, pH.
The connection between electrode potential (Eh) and the hydrogen ion
concentration (pH) was investigated in Belgium by M. Pourbaix. He
derived diagrams which connect these values with the electrochemical reac-
tions between metals and water which was made either acid or alkaline.
Both electrode potential, Eh, and hydrogen ion concentration, pH, influ-
ence the transfer of electrons in the system so that hydrogen evolution and
oxygen absorption depend on these factors and these reactions are the
basis of electrolytic corrosion. The effects of Eh and pH on the extent to
which water will liberate either hydrogen or oxygen during what we term
'electrolysis' are illustrated in Fig. 21.7. Hydrogen will only be liberated
under conditions of Eh and pH which are represented by a point below
'ab\ and oxygen can only be liberated if Eh and pH are represented by a
point above 'cd\ Hence there is a domain (between ab and cd) on the
EJpH diagram where the electrolysis of water is impossible. As a result
the electrolysis of water cannot take place, regardless of the pH of the
electrolyte, unless the electrodes have a minimum potential difference of
at least 1.2 volts, that is the distance apart of ab and cd in terms of Eh.
21.38 In Fig. 21.7 the equilibrium of hydrogen and oxygen are rep-
resented in terms of Eh and pH. However, equilibrium of a metal in contact

with water can also be represented using a Pourbaix diagram. Since the
corrosion of iron (or mild steel) is important this is represented as a simpli-
fied diagram in Fig. 21.8. The complete Pourbaix diagram for iron is more
complex since several chemical reactions are involved. However, a simpli-
fied diagram can be drawn based on a study of the following chemical
equilibria:

When the electrode potential (Eh = -0.44 volts) of iron is measured in
pure water (pH = 7) it will be represented on the Pourbaix diagram (Fig.
21.8) by the point O. This indicates that corrosion can take place under
such conditions of Eu and pH. The diagram suggests three ways in which
the extent of corrosion could be reduced:
(a) The potential can be changed in the negative direction (X) so that
it enters the domain of immunity. This is the normal 'sacrificial' or
cathodic protection such as is offered by zinc or aluminium.
(b) The potential can be changed in a positive direction (Y) into the
domain of passivity by applying a suitable external EMF (21.110).
(c) The pH of the electrolyte can be increased, ie made more alkaline
(Z) so that the metal becomes passive. Inhibitors have this effect but
need careful control because the passivity domain extends over a very
narrow pH range, making constant surveillance of the electrolyte compo-
sition necessary.

Electrolytic Action or Wet Corrosion Involving
Mechanical Stress
21.40 It has already been shown (21.35 and 21.36) that electrolytic cor-
rosion can occur as a result of different parts of a microstructure being of
different compositions and, hence, different electrode potentials. Thus
intergranular corrosion can occur in a cast metal since impurities, segre-
gated at grain boundaries, have different electrode potentials to the rest of
the structure. Nevertheless a perfectly uniform wrought metal may corrode
more rapidly if it is in the cold-worked condition.
As we have seen cold-working causes a movement of dislocations
towards crystal boundaries (4.19). This 'pile-up' of dislocations results in
the formation of a region of elastic strain in the vicinity of the crystal
boundary and the iocked-up' stresses associated with this strain constitute
a region of higher energy level than is present in the remainder of the
crystal. If an electrolyte is present then energy can dissipate itself by the
grain-boundary atoms going into solution as ions. That is the high-energy
grain-boundary material is anodic to the rest of the crystal.
21.41 This type of intergranular corrosion manifests itself in many
instances. The 'season cracking' of 70-30 brass has been mentioned
(16.33), but of greater significance in the modern world is the accelerated
corrosion which occurs in mild steel which has been cold formed. In many
instances it is possible to apply a stress-relieving annealing process to the
cold-worked material but in other cases this is inappropriate either because
mechanical distortion of the structure would result or because the results
of cold-work are necessary to give rigidity and strength. Adequate protec-
tion of the surface by some form of coating is then the only way to prevent
corrosion.
Consider the cold-formed rim of a motor-car 'wing' (Fig. 21.9). The

forming operation will have cold-worked the rim more severely than the
rest of the structure making it anodic to its surroundings so that, assuming
that the paint work is defective, corrosion will be accelerated there particu-
larly when salt-laden moisture collects during winter. This type of corrosion
in metals is generally termed stress corrosion and may not necessarily be
caused by cold-work. For example, locked-up stresses may be set up near
to welded joints as a result of non-uniform cooling. Similar situations may
occur during the cooling of a casting. It must be admitted, however, that
in both welded joints and castings galvanic corrosion is much more likely
to be the result of variations in composition rather than variations in strain
energy.
21.42 Corrosion assists in other forms of failure which plague the
engineer. Thus corrosion fatigue refers to the failure of a component in
which the propagation of a fatigue crack is helped by corrosion, or indeed
initiated by corrosion. A surface flaw may be accentuated by corrosion and
then act as a focal point for the initiation of a fatigue crack (5.65). Once
such a fatigue crack has started its progress will be accelerated by corrosion
due to the anodic effect of high stress concentrations always present at the
root of the crack.
21.43 Impingement corrosion 
describes a process involving electro-
lytic action following mechanical abrasion of the surface. Thus particles of
grit or entrained air bubbles carried in a flow of liquid may impinge upon
an oxide-coated surface, wearing away the oxide skin. Electrolytic action
between the cathodic oxide skin and the anodic metal beneath follows (Fig.
21.10) leading to solution of the metal. This form of attack is prevalent in
tubes carrying sea water but also occurs with fresh water, particularly when
the flow of water is so rapid that the rate of damage to protective films
exceeds the rate of repair by oxidation. Corrosion in this instance is not a
result of mechanical working but of removal of an oxide film so that simple
galvanic action can occur between the rest of the oxide film and the exposed
metal.
Fig. 21.10 'Impingement corrosion' results from a combination of mechanical abrasion and
electrolytic action. The corrosion product will be flushed away.

Electrolytic Action or Wet Corrosion Involving
Electrolytes of Non-uniform Composition
21.50 Electrolytic action may occur between two electrodes of precisely
the same composition if these electrodes are in contact with an electrolyte
which is different in composition at the surface of each electrode. This
situation can be described by reference to what is termed a concentration
cell (Fig. 21.11). Here both electrodes are of pure iron but the electrolyte,
Fig. 21.11 
A'concentration'cell.
iron(II) chloride solution, is more concentrated on the right of the cell
than on the left. The cell is divided by a porous plate—similar to that in
an old-fashioned Leclanche cell—which prevents the two solutions from
mixing freely but is sufficiently porous to allow the passage of ions and so
maintain 'electrical contact'. The main reaction in the cell is represented
by:
Fe ^± Fe++ 4- 2e"
and the direction in which it proceeds at any point in the cell is governed
by the concentration of the reactants. Therefore, on the left-hand side, the
relatively low concentration of Fe++ ions will cause iron atoms to form
ions, releasing electrons to the external circuit:
Fe -» Fe++ + 2e"
On the right-hand side of the cell the already high concentration of Fe++
ions will tend to make the reaction go in the opposite direction as these
ions receive electrons from the external circuit:
pure iron
anode
porous plate
pure iron
cathode
dil. ironin) chloride solution
cone, ironin) chloride solution

Since iron atoms are entering solution as Fe++ ions at the left-hand elec-
trode this is obviously the anode, whilst the electrode on the right-hand
side becomes the cathode as is indicated by the movement of electrons in
the external circuit.
21.51 Electrolytic action of this type is the basis of corrosion which
occurs in a variety of different instances in engineering practice. For
example, so-called 'crevice corrosion' is caused by a non-uniform distri-
bution of dissolved oxygen in water thus producing a 'concentration cell'
situation. In Fig. 21.12 two steel plates of similar composition are bolted
together and, although the gap between them is small, water will be drawn
into the gap by capillary action. If, for a short time, the concentration of
dissolved oxygen increases in that water exposed to the atmosphere, then
the region 'C of the plate will become cathodic to that at 'A\ The plate
in the vicinity of A is covered by water containing less oxygen and so
becomes anodic. As soon as this happens iron atoms will begin to ionise
in the anodic area of the crevice forming Fe++ ions, and the electrons so
released will travel quickly through the steel plate to the cathodic area to
form OH" ions:
2H2O + O2 + 4e" -> 4OH
As the concentration of OH" ions in the cathodic area is thus increased so
a persistent concentration cell is set up since oxygen is unable to dissolve
in the water trapped in the crevice, whereas oxygen is able to dissolve
continuously from the atmosphere in the cathodic area.
Having the greater mobility, Fe++ ions travel outwards to the cathodic
area more quickly than the OH" ions travel to the anodic region. Therefore
the reaction:
Fe++ + 2OH" -> Fe(OH)2
occurs mainly outside the crevice. Fe(OH)2 is rapidly oxidised to Fe(OH)3,
'rust'. Thus the formation of a concentration cell accelerates corrosion but
it accelerates it where the concentration of oxygen is lower. This explains
Fig. 21.12 The 'crevice corrosion' of steel plates.

why steel corrodes most in places where it would seem to be better pro-
tected from the atmosphere.
21.52 The fairly rapid rusting which occurs in the vicinity of defective
paintwork on a motor car is explained in Fig. 21.13. Water begins to
penetrate beneath the loose paint film but oxygen does not and so the
metal beneath the paint becomes anodic to that which is exposed to the
atmosphere. Crevice corrosion then proceeds as above.
Fig. 21.13 
Sub-paint rusting of a motor car body. Another case of crevice corrosion.
One frequently hears a motor-car owner bemoaning the fact that 'rust
is eating its way beneath the painting work'. In fact of course the reverse
is true—Fe++ ions are moving outwards from beneath the paint to form
rust at the cathodic surface. Some of the Fe++ ions will meet up with OH"
ions as these move slowly inwards beneath the paint. As a result some rust
forms beneath the paint producing blisters which lift it off.
Accumulations of chemically-inert dirt on the surface of exposed metal
will also give rise to this form of corrosion. Such encrustations allow moist-
ure to penetrate and this moisture becomes increasingly deficient in oxygen
thus giving rise to anodic spots beneath the dirt. This situation is made
worse by the salt used on roads in winter since Cl" ions will tend to
congregate along with OH" ions outside the dirt encrustations and con-
siderably increase the concentration gradient within the electrolyte. It is
far more important to wash away accumulated dirt from the hidden parts
of a motor-car—particularly during winter—than it is to waste time pol-
ishing the areas which are visible. 'Wings' invariably rust from beneath
particularly where 'mud traps' have been incorporated into the design.
21.53 Finally we will consider why a sheet of high-quality mild steel
rusts under the action of a simple rain drop (Fig. 21.14). Here the concen-
Fig. 21.14 The rusting of mild steel in the presence of a rain drop containing dissolved
oxygen.

tration of dissolved oxygen in the rain drop will be higher at 'C than at
'A' where the depth of water is greater, so that dissolved oxygen reaches
the metal surface at A more slowly. A concentration cell is therefore set
up so that atoms of iron at A go into solution as Fe++ ions releasing
electrons which pass through the 'external circuit' (the mild stbel sub-
surface) to C where OH" ions form. A deposit of Fe(OH)2 is produced
mainly around the periphery of the rain drop and this oxidises immediately
to form Fe(OH)3 or 'rust'.
This type of corrosion would appear to be important on the massive scale
with the many off-shore structures associated with oil and gas operations in
the North Sea, for as water depth increases so the oxygen content decreases
as in the case with the droplet of water described above. However the rate
of corrosion is probably influenced more directly by factors such as sea
water velocity (impingement corrosion—21.43), chlorine ion (-Cl") con-
centration, marine organisms, temperature and the rise and fall of the
tides.
The Prevention of Corrosion
21.60 There are two principal methods by which corrosion may be pre-
vented or minimised. First, the metallic surface can be insulated from the
corrosive medium by some form of protective coating. Such coatings
include various types of paints and varnishes, metallic films having good
corrosion-resistance and artificially thickened oxide films. All of these are
generally effective in protecting surfaces from atmospheric corrosion. Zinc
coatings are used to protect iron and steel from the rusting action of moist
atmospheres and though zinc offers its 'sacrificial protection' (21.33) ^s a
second line of defence, it should be clearly understood that the main objec-
tive is to produce a sound continuous film of zinc which will seal off the iron
completely from atmospheric action. Sacrificial protection is a temporary
phenomenon and is only effective for a limited time since the zinc dissolves
quickly once electrolytic action begins.
Tin coatings offer protection against most animal and vegetable juices
encountered in the canning industry but due to current very high costs of
tin extremely thin coatings of the metal are used on the mild-steel cans.
This tin coat is now generally covered by a film of some organic polymer
(plastics material) as the main protection, so that modern tin cans tend to
rust on the outside rather than the inside.
21.61 In circumstances where corrosive action is severe, or where
mechanical abrasion is likely to damage a surface coating, it may be neces-
sary to use a metal or alloy which has an inherent resistance to corrosion.
Such corrosion-resistant alloys are relatively expensive, so that their use is
limited generally to chemical-engineering plant, marine-engineering equip-
ment and other special applications.

The Use of a Metal or Alloy Which Is Inherently
Corrosion-resistant
21.70 The corrosion-resistance of a pure metal or a homogeneous solid
solution is generally superior to that of an alloy in which two or more
phases are present in the microstructure. As mentioned above, the exist-
ence of two phases leads to electrolytic action when the surface of the alloy
comes into contact with an electrolyte. The phase with the lower electrode
potential will behave anodically and dissolve, leading to pitting of the alloy
surface; and the greater the difference in electrode potentials between the
phases, the more rapid will be corrosion. Resistance to corrosion will
generally be at a minimum when the second phase is segregated at the
crystal boundaries, particularly if this phase is anodic to the matrix. In
such circumstances serious intercrystalline corrosion will occur.
21.71 Most of the alloys which are used because of their high corrosion-
resistance exhibit solid-solution structures. Aluminium-magnesium alloys
(17.30) containing up to 7.0 % magnesium fulfil these conditions and are
particularly resistant to marine atmospheres. 18-8 stainless steel is com-
pletely austenitic when correctly heat-treated but faulty heat-treatment
may lead to the precipitation of chromium carbide at the grain boundaries.
This gives rise to a zone adjacent to the grain boundary which is impover-
ished in chromium (Fig. 21.15(i)) so that it becomes anodic to the remain-
der of the crystal which is still rich in chromium. Consequently in the
presence of a strong electrolyte (mineral acids and the like) intergranular
corrosion will occur (Fig. 21.15(ii)). 'Weld decay' occurs in 18-8 stainless
steels for similar reasons (20.93).
Fig. 21.15 
'Weld decay1 in austenitic stainless steel.
21.72 As might be expected, coring in a cast alloy of the solid-solution
type gives rise to a quicker rate of corrosion than that which obtains when
the same solid solution has been cold-worked and annealed. This treatment
produces greater homogeneity in the structure and reduces the extent to
which electrolytic action will take place between the core and outer fringes
of individual crystals. Similarly, the presence of impurities segregated at
the crystal boundaries of a metal used in either the alloyed or unalloyed
state will accelerate corrosion by setting up electrolytic action with the
metal when an electrolyte is present.

The relative corrosion-resistance of types of microstructure.
21.73 Although a homogeneous single phase metal or alloy will tend
to be less vulnerable to simple electrolytic corrosion, it will of course
succumb to attack which is caused by mechanical stress (21.40) or by
local variations in electrolyte composition (21.50). Thus stainless steel is
susceptible to crevice corrosion since it relies for its corrosion resistance
on a supply of oxygen to maintain a dense protective film of chromium
oxide on the surface (13.16). For similar reasons stainless steel may suffer
impingement corrosion when abrasive particles damage the oxide skin in
the presence of strong electrolytes such as acid chloride solutions.
The effects of cold-work in producing regions of high-energy value which
accelerate corrosion have already been mentioned. 70-30 brass, normally
a reasonably corrosion-resistant single-phase alloy when of high purity,
nevertheless suffers 'season cracking' (16.33) as a result of intergranular
corrosion associated with deep drawing and the pile-up of dislocations at
grain boundaries so produced.
Protection by Metallic Coatings
21.80 Protection afforded by metallic coatings can be either 'direct' or
'sacrificial'. Direct protection depends on an unbroken film of some cor-
rosion-resistant metal covering the article, and if the film becomes broken,
corrosion may be accelerated by electrolytic action between the film and
the metal beneath. In the case of sacrificial protection, however, the met-
allic film becomes anodic in the event of a break in the film, and thus
dissolves in preference to the cathodic surface beneath. It follows that,
when protection is limited to the direct type, as in the case of tin coatings
on steel, the quality of the coating is most important, since acceleration,
and not inhibition, of corrosion would follow a break in the film. In both
cases, of course, protection of the direct type is the fundamental aim of
the metal-coating process, and it is only in the possibility of the coating
becoming broken that the effects of electrolytic action must be considered.

ings. The most widely used are either electro-plating or dipping the articles
to be coated into a bath of the molten metal. Other methods involve
spraying or volatilising the protective metal on to the surface whilst mech-
anical 'cladding' is also used.
21.81 'Cladding' is used chiefly in the production of 'clad' sheet and
is employed prior to the final manufacturing stages of a component. The
base metal is sandwiched between pieces of the coating metal and the
sandwich is then rolled to the required thickness. In some cases the film
of protective metal can be sprayed on to the base surface and then rolled
on. 'Alclad' is duralumin coated with pure aluminium (up to 0.01 mm thick
depending upon the overall thickness of the stock) but other high-strength
alloys of aluminium, which have poor corrosion resistance because of their
multi-phase microstructures, are also clad. Mild steel clad with stainless
steel is also available but it is important to note that with all forms of
cladding damage to the protective skin can take place during fabrication.
21.82 Hot-dip Metal Coating Tin and zinc are the metals most often
used to produce metallic coatings in this manner, though use is also made
of aluminium. Ideally the coating should adhere to the base surface by
solid solution between the two. In some cases however, brittle intermetallic
compounds are formed at or near the interface such as FeSn2, FeSn, or
Fe2Sn in the case of hot-dip tinning.
(a) Hot-dip Tinning. Tinplate is principally used in the manufacture of
cans for packaging a wide variety of foodstuffs. The non-toxic properties
of tin, combined with its good corrosion-resistance and the ease with which
tin-coated articles can be soldered, make it a useful metal for coating
articles which come into contact with all types of food.
The mild-steel sheet used for the manufacture of tinplate is usually about
0.25 mm thick, and, after being annealed, it is freed from all traces of
oxide by pickling in either dilute sulphuric acid or dilute hydrochloric acid.
The tinning unit comprises a thermostatically controlled vessel of molten
tin in which is submerged a system of guides and rollers for conducting the
pickled sheets down through a layer of molten flux into the tin and then
upwards and out of the tin through a layer of palm oil. As they pass
through the palm oil, the sheets are subjected to a squeegeeing action by
tinned-steel rollers, which serve to control the final thickness of coating on
the sheets.
After leaving the tinning machine, the tinned sheets are cooled and then
cleaned, usually by washing them in an alkaline detergent. Finally, they
are polished in either bran or wood meal.
Other iron and steel items of kitchenware such as mincing machines and
mixers, are coated by hot-dipping after fabrication. After being cleaned,
degreased and pickled, the component is immersed in a pot of molten tin,
on the surface of which is a layer of flux. If the operations have been
correctly carried out a brilliant finish is obtained which requires little in
the way of after-work.
(b) Hot-dip Galvanising. The term galvanising is derived from the name
of Luigi Galvani, the Italian physiologist, whose classic observations of

dead frogs, in 1786, led to Volta's development of the electric cell. In 1829
Faraday observed that when zinc and iron, in contact with each other,
were exposed to the air in the presence of a salt solution the iron did not
rust; whereas if the zinc were removed the iron rusted rapidly. Faraday
attributed this to 'the effect of chemical action . . . in exciting electricity'.
In 1836 a Frenchman, Sorel, took out a patent for a process of coatmg
steel with zinc by hot-dipping, and named the process galvanising. The
word was used to indicate the sacrificial electro-chemical protection
afforded iron by the zinc.
Before being galvanised, the surface of steel must be thoroughly cleaned,
either by shot blasting or, more generally, by pickling in dilute sulphuric
acid. In order to prevent contamination of the molten zinc by iron, the
work is then washed to remove all traces of iron salts formed by pickling.
It is necessary, however, to protect the surface of the work from fresh
oxidation, so it is immersed in a flux bath consisting of a solution of zine
chloride and ammonium chloride. This flux is usually dried on to the sur-
face in an oven which is provided with an adequate draught and working
at a low temperature, to prevent interaction between the flux and the iron
surface.
The work, with its protective flux coating, is then immersed in the molten
zinc bath. The flux coating peels away to form a layer on the surrounding
bath surface, which in turn is protected from oxidation; and the surface of
the work is left clean so that it is immediately wetted by the molten zinc.
The thickness of the coating produced depends largely upon the tempera-
ture of the bath and the'rate at which the work is withdrawn, but good-
quality galvanised articles should carry between 0.3 and 0.6 kg/m2 of zinc
on the surface. Thinner and more flexible coatings are obtained by using
a zinc bath containing about 0.2% aluminium. This limits the formation of
intermetallic compounds of iron and zinc on the steel surface.
In addition to corrugated iron for roofing, the large number of galvanised
products includes buckets, barbed wire, water tanks, marine fittings, bolts,
and fencing fittings, agricultural equipment and window frames. Many
galvanised products such as dust bins have been replaced by plastics mould-
ings whilst aluminium is becoming increasingly popular for the manufac-
ture of window frames.
(c) Hot-dip Coating with Aluminium (Aluminising) is used in the protec-
tion of iron and steel surfaces under a wide variety of trade names, the
best-known of which is 'Aludip'. In all of these processes the surface must
be cleaned by grit blasting, de-greasing and/or pickling. It is then carefully
dried before immersion in a bath of molten aluminium at about 7000C,
generally through a layer of molten flux. In some processes steel sheet is
heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen at 10000C prior to dipping in order
to reduce any oxide films present, but in addition to the extra cost of this
treatment the quality of the product is often less satisfactory.
In some methods, particularly in the USA, the aluminium-dipped mild-
steel sheet is then rolled to give a better surface finish. This product is used
to replace tinplate for some containers.
(d) Hot-dip Coating with ZinclAluminium Alloys. These relatively new

commercial processes are said to give a much more corrosion-resistant
coating on steel sheet, strip, wire and tube than is obtained by conventional
hot-dip galvanising. The high-aluminium coatings Galvalume and
Zincalume use an alloy containing 55Al-45Zn and small amounts of sili-
con; whilst Galfan coatings are based on 95Zn-5Al (with very small
additions of 'rare earth' metals). Though Galfan coating is less corrosion
resistant than those of the 55Al-45Zn alloys it has better formability and
retains paint more effectively.
21.83 Coating by Means of a Spray of Molten Metal Metal spraying
consists in projecting so-called 'atomised' particles of molten metal from
a special pistol on to a suitably prepared surface. Surface preparation
usually involves blasting the surface with an abrasive; steel grit having
replaced sharp silica sand for this purpose because of health hazards
involved when the latter is used. It is essential that the surface is rough-
ened, rather than peened or polished by the grit in order that good
adhesion shall take place. Hence attention to the condition of the grit is
important. The metals most commonly used for spraying are zinc and
aluminium, though coatings of tin, lead, cadmium, copper, silver and stain-
less steel can be so deposited.
Early metal spraying processes, originally invented by Dr. Schoop, used
an oxyacetylene flame to carry particles of metal on to the work surface.
The metal was injected into the flame as a powder. Later modifications of
the Schoop process used electrical melting of the metal. An arc was struck
between two zinc wires in the pistol and the molten zinc so produced
was 'atomised' and carried forward in a blast of compressed air. Flame
impingement methods are now the most common, using a specially
designed flame gun in conjunction with either a continuous rod or a hopper
feeding powder to the high-velocity flame. The temperature is generally
sufficient to melt the metal, but not necessarily so, and in either case the
small particles are projected with high energy at the work surface.
The most important factor is rigid control of the flame conditions. If
too high a temperature or too oxidising flame conditions prevail then the
particles may be oxidised before they reach the work surface. Nevertheless
it is a satisfactory method for structural steel provided that flame conditions
are controlled.
Metal spraying has wide application in view of its portability and flexi-
bility; thus, large structures, such as storage tanks, pylons and bridges, can
be sprayed on site. Notable recent examples include the Forth Road Bridge
and the Volta River Bridge (Ghana), both of which were zinc coated using
modern developments of the Schoop process.
21.84 Sherardising is a cementation process, similar in many respects
to carburising, in that zinc is made to combine with an iron or steel surface
by heating the work with zinc dust at a temperature below the melting
point of zinc. The first patent for this process was taken out in London in
1901 by Sherard Cowper-Coles, after whom the process is named. Much
thinner coatings can be obtained by sherardising than are possible with
hot-dip galvanising, and generally about 0.15 kg/m2 of zinc is used. More-
over, a more even film is obtained, thus making possible the treatment

of such articles as nuts and bolts, the threaded portions of which would
undoubtedly become clogged by hot-dipping.
As in all other coating processes, the surface of the work must first
be properly prepared. This usually involves degreasing, followed by acid
pickling in cold 50% hydrochloric acid or in hot 10% sulphuric acid. Shot
blasting is also used, particularly in the case of iron castings, to remove
graphite and core sand.
The work is packed into mild-steel drums along with some zinc
powder. The drums are heated to 3700C and rotated slowly so that the
tumbling action brings all the components into contact with the powdered
zinc.
'Calorising' is a process in which steel components are coated with alu-
minium by a similar method. The components are treated in a heated
rotating cylinder containing a mixture of aluminium and aluminium oxide
powders. It is used principally to provide a protective coating for heat-
treatment pots, ladles and furnace components. Nickel alloys may be pro-
tected from attack by sulphur gases by aluminising them. The components
are packed into a heat-resistant box along with aluminium powder. Air
is then purged from the box by flushing it with argon or nitrogen. The
tightly-sealed box is then heated for several hours to promote aluminisation
of the surface. 'Chromising' is a similar process involving chromium coat-
ing of a mild steel surface in which corrosion resistance comparable with
that of a 12% chromium steel can be achieved.
21.85 Electro-plating The formation of metal coatings by electro-
deposition is well known, and a wide variety of metals can be thus used,
including copper, nickel, chromium, cadmium, gold and silver. Tin and
zinc can also be electro-deposited, and a coating thus formed has advan-
tages over one produced by hot-dipping in respect of flexibility, uniformity
and control of thickness of film.
The usual degreasing and pickling processes must be applied to the
surface before any attempt is made at electro-plating it. Most instances of
peeling and blistering in the case of chromium-plating are due to inad-
equate preparation of the surface. The author has seen specimens in which
the layer of chromium had been deposited on to oxide scale, with the
inevitable peeling of the chromium as a result.
In the actual process of electro-plating the article to be plated is made
the cathode in an electrolytic cell. Sometimes the metal to be deposited is
contained, as a soluble salt, in the electrolyte, in which case the anode is
a non-reactive conductor, such as stainless steel, lead or carbon. In most
cases, however, the anode consists of a plate of the pure metal which is
being deposited, whilst the electrolyte will contain a salt or salts of the
same metal. Then, the anode gradually dissolves and maintains the concen-
tration of the metal in the electrolyte as it is deposited on to the articles
forming the cathode.
The conditions under which deposition takes place are very important,
so that the cell voltage, the current density (measured in amperes per
square metre of cathode surface), the ratio of anode area to cathode area
and the time of deposition, as well as the composition and temperature of

the electrolyte, must all be strictly controlled if a uniform adherent and
nonporous film is to be obtained.
21.86 Vacuum Coating and 'Ion Plating' In vacuum-coating pro-
cesses the work pieces are contained in a vessel from which air is evacuated.
The coating metal is electrically heated within the vessel so that, because
of the near vacuum conditions, it vaporises at low temperatures and will
then condense on any cold surfaces with which it makes contact. Head-light
reflectors and mirrors of all types are coated in this way.
With both vacuum coating and electroplating complex shapes are diffi-
cult to coat uniformly and to overcome this a technique called ion plating'
was introduced. Here the article to be plated is made the cathode in a
vessel containing low-pressure argon (Fig. 21.17). 'Glow discharge' occurs
in the region of the cathode due to ionisation of the argon and the Ar+
ions are attracted to the cathode, bombarding it and having a cleaning
effect on the surface. This is known as 'sputter cleaning' or 'ion scrubbing'.
Metal atoms are present as vapour emitted from the tungsten foil 'boat'
and about 1% of these ionise. These M+ ions are immediately accelerated
towards the work-piece comprising the cathode with which they collide.
The kinetic energy of the ions is dissipated as heat so that good adhesion
is provided because of the tendency of the plating ions to diffuse into the
substrate. By adequate control of the evaporation source alloy coatings
can be applied as well as pure metals.
Fig. 21.17 The principles of 'ion-plating'.
Protection by Oxide Coatings
21.90 In some instances the film of oxide which forms on the surface of
a metal is very dense and closely adherent. It will then protect the metal
surface beneath from oxidation. Stainless steels owe their resistance to
corrosion to the presence of a high proportion of chromium, which is one

of these elements that form oxide films impervious to oxygen. The blueing
of ordinary carbon steel by heating it in air produces an oxide film of such
a nature that it affords partial protection from corrosion.
21.91 Anodising Reference has already been made (21.21) to the
protection afforded aluminium by the natural film of oxide which forms
on its surface. Anodic oxidation, or anodising, is an electrolytic process
for thickening this oxide film. This process may be applied for several
reasons, such as to provide a key for painting, to provide an insulating
coating for an electrical conductor or to provide a surface which may be
dyed, as well as to increase the resistance of aluminium to corrosion.
Before being anodised the surface of the article must be chemically
clean. Preliminary treatment involves sand-blasting, scratch brushing or
barrel polishing, according to the nature of the component. This is followed
by degreasing in either the liquid or vapour of trichlorethylene; or by
electrolytic cleaning. The latter process is used mainly for highly polished
surfaces. The article is made the cathode in an electrolytic bath comprising
a 1% solution of sodium hydroxide, and treatment is continued for about
half a minute at a voltage of 14 and a current density of 550 A/m2. The
mechanism of this cleaning process is largely one of flotation of the film of
grease by hydrogen bubbles given off at the surface of the article which
comprises the cathode.
In the actual anodising operation which follows, the aluminium article
to be treated is made the anode in an electrolyte containing either chromic,
sulphuric or oxalic acid; the cathode being a plate of lead or stainless steel.
When an electric current is passed, oxygen is formed at the anode and
immediately combines with the aluminium surface of the article. The layer
of oxide thus formed grows outwards from the surface of the aluminium.
The normal thickness of a satisfactory anodic film produced commercially
varies between 0.007 and 0.015 mm, and a film having a thickness within
these limits would be formed by anodising a component in a 15% sulphuric
acid solution at 200C for about thirty minutes, using a current density of
about 100 A/m2 at a cell voltage of 15. A longer period of treatment
produces a thicker, but soft and spongy, film which would be unsatisfactory
in service. The thickness of the natural film produced on an aluminium
surface by exposure to air at normal temperatures is of the order of
0.000 013 mm.
The surface produced by anodising can be dyed by immersion in either
hot or cold baths of dyestuff, but whether or not the film is dyed, it should
always be sealed. The anodic coating is somewhat porous as it leaves
the electrolytic tank and is easily stained, but sealing renders the coating
impermeable. A simple, but quite effective, sealing process consists in
treatment with hot or boiling water, which renders the coating non-
absorptive without any visible change in appearance. Other sealing pro-
cesses include treatment in solutions of 1% nickel or cobalt acetates at
1000C, followed by boiling in water, the application of linseed oil or lanolin
to the surface or the application, while the article is warm, of a mixture
containing equal parts of turpentine, oleic acid and stearic acid.
21.92 Beryllium Oxide Coatings The addition of small amounts of

beryllium to aluminium-base alloys causes a coating of beryllium oxide,
BeO, to form on the surface. This is even more protective than the natural
skin of aluminium oxide, Al2Ch, described above. Unfortunately beryllium
is an extremely expensive metal. Nevertheless 0.1-0.3% beryllium is added
to some high-quality aluminium alloy castings for aerospace purposes.
In addition to providing the protective BeO skin beryllium acts as a
'scavenger' of oxygen and nitrogen in the melt. It also refines the structure
of any iron-based intermetallic compounds which may be present, replac-
ing the coarse needles with small equi-axed crystals.
Protection by Other Non-metallic Coatings
21.100 Coatings of this type usually offer only a limited protection against
corrosion and are, more often than not, used only as a base for painting.
21.101 Phosphating 
A number of commercial processes fall under
this heading, but in all of them a coating of phosphate is produced on the
surface of steel or zinc-base alloys by treating them in or with a solution
containing phosphoric acid and, generally, a metallic phosphate. The phos-
phate film which forms on the surface is usually grey in colour, about
0.0005 mm thick and offers only limited protection against corrosion but
since its surface is rough it provides an excellent 'key' for paint, varnish or
lacquer.
In automobile body work it also limits any filiform or scab corrosion
resulting from stone chipping by thus preventing any 'crevice corrosion'
(21.51) beneath the paint film.
In the automobile industry the spot-welded car body (termed the 'body
in white' at this stage) is usually given a preliminary degreasing treatment.
The phosphate coating is then achieved by using a phosphoric acid spray
in order that the hydrogen so liberated is flushed away:
Fe 4- 2H3PO4 -> Fe(H2PO4)2 + H21
The reaction will then proceed to completion:
3Fe(H2PO4)2 -> Fe3(PO4)2 + 4H3PO4
Iron phosphate, Fe3(PO4)2, forms as an insoluble grey adherent crystalline
coating on the surface being treated.
A number of proprietary processes based on phosphating have been
introduced since 1903. Some readers may have used the preparation Kurust
which is available for the small-scale treatment of rusted steelwork, princi-
pally the bodywork of decrepit—though not necessarily ancient—motor
cars.
21.102 Chromating 
Chromate coatings are produced on magnesium-
base alloys, and on zinc and its alloys, by immersing the articles in a bath
containing potassium bichromate along with various other additions. The

colour of the films varies with the bath and alloy, from yellow to grey and
black. With steel a chromate film has little permanence but it is sometimes
used following phosphating or zinc-coating of steel and as an additive to
zinc-based primer paints.
21.103 Electrophoresis This process—also known as 'electro-
painting'—is used mainly to apply undercoat paint to steel which has
already been phosphated. The chemistry of the process is fairly involved,
but briefly, the paint bath consists of colloidal particles of the appropriate
'resin' suspended in a water solution which contains an electrolyte. DC
electrodes one of which is the article being painted, are immersed in the
bath.
The resin particles, constituting the paint, acquire a charge by adsorbing
ions from the electrolyte so that they are then attracted towards the appro-
priate electrode. Sometimes the ions are provided by one of the reagents
in the paint bath. For example, if a colloid is kept in suspension by soap
solution the negatively-charged ion of the soap (the 'fatty acid' radical)
may be adsorbed by the colloid particles giving them a negative charge so
that the combined particle is attracted to the anode which will be the article
being painted.
This method produces a very uniform paint film on both flat surfaces
and sharp edges. As soon as the colloidal particle is deposited it insulates
that portion of the surface and so other charged particles then 'seek out'
bare areas which are still charged. For this reason a very complete and
uniform film can be deposited and if an ammeter is included in the circuit
it will read zero when coating is complete. The fact that the paint is carried
in a water solution reduces fire risks but at the same time the resultant film
is dense because a phenomenon known as electro-osmosis causes molecules
of the liquid to migrate away from the electrode so that the paint film
becomes denser. The process is of obvious value in the motor industry
where complete bodies can be coated by dipping into an electrophoretic
bath.
21.104 The 'Elphal' Process is similar in principle but is used to coat
steel strip with aluminium. Here finely-divided aluminium is carried in a
water/alcohol bath which also contains an electrolyte. The aluminium par-
ticles are not ions and neither this process nor electrophoresis generally
should be confused in any way with electroplating. In this case aluminium
particles become charged by attachment to ions from the electrolyte and
consequently migrate to the steel surface (electrode) where they adhere
loosely. The solvent is removed by heating and the coating then compacted
by cold rolling. Finally the aluminium film is sintered on to the surface of
the steel by heat treatment.
21.105 Surface Protection at High Temperatures The drive towards
higher efficiency and performance means that engineering environments
are becoming increasingly hostile. The first line of defence against deterio-
ration of any component is its surface. Unfortunately many materials which
are designed for strength do not offer a high resistance to corrosion and
wear, especially at high temperatures. This is a major problem in the design
of gas turbine engines, particularly in respect of the blades.

Many problems of wear and corrosion in gas turbines have been solved
by using plasma-sprayed coatings on the surface. The plasma torch (Fig.
21.18) uses the energy in a thermally ionised gas to propel partially molten
fine powder particles on to a prepared surface so that they adhere on
impact. A DC arc is initiated between the electrodes by a high EMF. The
design of the torch is such that the energy involved is concentrated into a
very small region so that temperatures up to 30 0000C can be achieved. As
the heated argon expands rapidly the particles are accelerated to very high
velocities (up to 600 m/s). In order to prevent oxidation of the particles
the torch is usually fitted with an inert gas shield.
Fig. 21.18 A typical plasma torch.
Most of the coating materials are based on aluminium and chromium,
both of which form protective films of tenacious refractory oxide. Such
surface films are effectively self-sealing and since the ionic mobilities
(21.21) of chromium and aluminium within the film are low, oxidation
rates beneath the film are also very low. The surface tenacity of chromia/
alumina film is increased by the addition of small amounts of the 'rare-
earth' metal yttrium.
These materials are designated MCrAlY coatings (Table 21.2) where
M is either nickel or cobalt (or a mixture of both) and are used for turbine
corrosion protection in advanced military and civil aero gas turbines.

Cathodic Protection
21.110 Steel structure will corrode more rapidly if it becomes anodic to
its environment. Thus the hull of a ship can be expected to rust more
quickly at the stern since it is anodic to the nearby manganese bronze
propellers. Moreover salt water acts as a strong electrolyte since it contains
large concentrations of Cl" as well as OH" ions. The hull can be sacrificially
protected in the region of the propellers by bolting slabs of zinc or mag-
nesium to the hull. Since these slabs are more strongly anodic than is the
steel hull towards the propellers, then they naturally replace the steel hull
as anode. The hull then assumes the role of 'external circuit' in the galvanic
system so produced, so that it transmits electrons without suffering ionis-
ation (Fig. 21.19).
21.111 Similarly an iron or steel pipe or storage tank situated below
ground can be sacrificially protected by burying a slab of zinc or magnesium
adjacent to it. Alternatively an external EMF may be used to render the
steel structure passive to its surroundings (Fig. 21.20) That is the EMF is
applied in the direction Y indicated on the Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 21.8).
The inert graphite electrode is made the anode by virtue of the applied
EMF and so the steel tank becomes cathodic to it. Obviously the value of
the EMF necessary to provide passivity will depend on the pH of the soil
as well as other factors, and the electrical output will need to be controlled
by a feed-back system which automatically adjusts the EMF (Eh) required
from the transformer/rectifier system. Eh can be monitored by a high-
resistance voltmeter connected to a reference electrode. Where mains elec-
tricity—and the necessary qualified maintenance back-up—are available
this system will be cheaper to operate than any electro-chemical source, ie
sacrificial anodes. This is obvious thermodynamically since the metals of
which the sacrificial anodes are made have to be deposited electrolytically
in the first place.
21.112 It is also more satisfactory to use a power-impressed EMF to

tection of a ship's hull.

limit corrosion in a ship's hull since the EMF so provided can be monitored
to suit prevailing conditions which will vary with salinity and temperature
of the ocean, conditions of paintwork on the hull (area of metal exposed)
and the area of the hull in contact with the water (which, in turn, depends
upon the load the ship is carrying).
In some cases buried pipe lines can be cathodically protected by using
impressed EMF supplied by small windmill-driven dynamos. A similar
method is sometimes used in the cathodic protection of off-shore oil or gas
rigs, but because frequent inspection is necessary to check for corrosion of
electrical contacts the sacrificial anode system is usually preferred. 300 kg
anodes of Al-Zn-In alloy are generally distributed uniformly around the
structure. A large structure with up to twenty-five years of design life may
require up to 500 tonnes of such anode material.
