Mixed State
Peter Mittelstaedt
The most general state of a proper quantum system S with  Hilbert space HS is
given by a self-adjoint positive operator with trace 1, i.e. by an operator
WS = WS+ ⩾0 with tr {WS} = 1.
It can be shown that these positive trace class 1 operators form a convex set
T1+(HS) [1].
Two kinds of states must be distinguished. If WS is idempotent, i.e. WS = WS2,
then WS is a pure state given by an projection operator P[ϕ] where ϕ ∈HS is an
element of HS. If, however, WS ̸= WS2, then WS describes a mixed state. As any
self-adjoint operator, a mixed state WS can be decomposed according to its spectral
decomposition
WS =

i
wi P[Mi]
with real numbers wi such that 0 ⩽wi ⩽1 and projection operators P ( pro-
jection), which project on subspaces Mi of HS. It must be emphasised, however,
that the decomposition is not uniquely deﬁned, since there are many other, non-
orthogonal decompositions of WS. If, in addition, the operator WS has a degenerate
spectrum, there are also inﬁnitely many orthogonal decompositions.
There are two kinds of mixed states of S given by an operator WS
=

i wi P [ϕi] with 0 ⩽wi ⩽1, which are distinguished by their preparation.
(a) Mixture of states
Assume that a preparation apparatus does not work completely accurately
and prepares systems with states ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3 . . ., say, with a priori probabilities
p1, p2, p3 . . ., which depend on the construction of the apparatus. In this case, any

single system is actually in one of the states ϕi, which one, however, is not known
to the observer who knows only the probabilities. This very special kind of a mixed
stated is called a “mixture of states” [2], or “real mixture” [3] or a “Gemenge” [4]. A
“Gemenge” S(pk, ϕk) is a classical mixture of states ϕk with weights pk. Formally,
it can be described by the state operator WS = 
k wk P[ϕk], since this mixed state
operator leads to the same statistical predictions as the “Gemenge” S(pk, ϕk).
(b)  Mixed state (in general)
Let S = S1 + S2 be a compound system with  Hilbert space H that consists of
two subsystems S1 and S2 with Hilbert spaces H1 and H2, such that H = H1 ⊗H2
is the tensor product Hilbert space. If S is prepared in a pure state (S), then the
subsystems S1 and S2 are in the reduced mixed states W(S1) = tr2 {P[(S)]} and
W(S2) = tr1{P[(S)]}, where “trk” denotes the partial trace with respect to sys-
tem Sk. To say that the subsystem S1 is in a mixed state W(S1) means, that we
consider only those properties of the total system S that are concerned with the
degrees of freedom of system S1, neglecting in this way all possible correlations
between S1 and S2. ( Entanglement). The state W(S1) is a genuine mixed state
except when (S) is a product state  = ϕ(S1) ⊗ψ(S2). In this special situation
W(S1) is the pure state P[ϕ(S1)]. In general, W(S1) does not admit an “ ignorance
interpretation”. The mixed state W(S1) is also called – somewhat misleadingly –
“improper mixture” [3]. See also  density operator; objectiﬁcation; states in quan-
tum mechanics; states, pure and mixed and their representation.

Mixing and Oscillations of Particles
Andrzej K. Wr´oblewski
In 1955 Murray Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais analyzed the behaviour of neutral
particles under the operation C of charge conjugation which changes every par-
ticle into its anti-particle [1]. According to the proposed scheme of classiﬁcation
of K mesons, the neutral kaon K0 was assumed to possess an anti-particle K0
distinct from itself (at that time these particles were called θ0 and θ0, respectively).
